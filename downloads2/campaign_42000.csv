<p>On the basis of the tests and measurements we
performed, we found out that the optimal size is approximately
15cm/5,9inch smaller than the widest part of your thigh.</p>
<p>Example: If your thigh is 55 centimeters/21,7 inch
wide, your optimal size is 40 cm/ 15,7 inch, which corresponds to M in our
table.</p>

didn't know if it would appeal to the people. But in December we decided to get
it started. We created several different prototypes and put them to the test,
thus creating the optimal version of T-Holder. In February we will launch a
kickstarter campaign. If we get enough funds, we will buy the materials and
start the production, as soon as we have enough finances to get it going. If
everything goes according to plan, the first T-Holders will be avaliable in
June 2015!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1237293/files/20150221002613-4.jpg?1424507173"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>The one thing you really do not need to worry

partners. The package will be delivered to your home safely in just a few days.

<b>Availability: Currently the SmartTag is only available in black or Ladybug red.</b>
</div>
<div>As we grow this indiegogo campaign, we will issue updates on availability for the other colors. The more backers we achieve the more chances we have of funding the extra colors. <i>As more colors become available you will be emailed prior to shipping to ask if you'd like a different color.</i>
</div>
<div><b>App Updates &amp; Modification</b></div>
<div>The WalletTag is <i>purposely</i> designed to NOT make a sound, thereby not alerting other people to YOUR cash and credit cards. So, as we grow the backers and funding, we will improve the WalletTag App function to include a distance indicator, in addition to the map location function. </div>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How big are the Tags?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The WalletTag measures 50mm x 30mm and is only 3mm thin (2"" x 1 &amp; 3/16"" x 0.11"") – <b>THE WORLD'S THINNEST TRACKER AVAILABLE TODAY!</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The SmartTag measures 60mm x 35mm x 12mm (2.5"" x 1.5"" x 0.5"").</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How many Tag devices can a Smartphone pair with?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Using the free App, an iOS Smartphone can manage up to 4 Tags at once or 2 Tags on Android.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How do I replace the battery in my Tag?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Both devices have a simple sliding door to make battery replacement easy. WalletTag uses a single CR2016 battery (supplied). SmartTag uses a single CR2032 battery (supplied).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>What is the range of Tag?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Both Tags have a range of approximately 150 feet radius.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How do the Tags attach to items?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The WalletTag is super slim &amp; slips inside any wallet or purse without detection. It also has a custom pouch available. The SmartTag comes with a key chain.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How are these Tags different from other locator products?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">1) They each have a Selfie Remote!! <i><b>C'mon, how cool is that?</b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">2)Two-Way Technology with the SmartTag: Find your item using your phone or find your phone using your SmartTag. (Note the WalletTag can find your phone, but the WalletTag itself is silent and cannot ring - it's specifically designed that way as a warning device for losing your wallet - i.e. your cash, so it doesn't let everyone else know!)</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">3) The WalletTag is <b>THE THINNEST TRACKER AVAILABLE ON THE PLANET</b>: only 3mm (0.11"") thin.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">4) Loss Proximity Alarm: Notifies you when you leave an item behind as well as remembers <i>where </i>you left the item as shown within the app on Google Maps.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Are the Tags water resistant?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The device will last through rain but isn't waterproof. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>What version of iOS are these Tags compatible with?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">They are compatible with iOS 6 &amp; up - Max 4 tags</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Are they compatible with Android?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yes, Android OS 4.4 &amp; up - Max 2 tags</p>

SmartTag What's Important to You... 



The SmartTag - Never Lose Anything Again!The SmartTag is a Bluetooth low-energy tracking alarm. Pair it with your iOS or Android phone or tablet and if you walk away from your tagged item, the SmartTag will emit an audible alarm, and at the same time your Smartphone will ring to let you know you have lost connection between your phone and your tagged item. Using Google Maps on your Smartphone you can also see where you and your item were separated. Lost your phone? Press the SmartTag button & your phone rings. Lost your tagged item? Press the ""Find Me"" button on the App, the SmartTag will ring. 
   Cool Bonus: the SmartTag is also a Selfie Remote for your cell camera! 




The WalletTag - Never Lose Your Wallet Again!




 The WalletTag Bluetooth Tracker



At just 3mm thin, the WalletTag is the slimmest tracking device in the world! It's a Bluetooth low-energy silent alarm tracker. Pair it with your iOS or Android phone or tablet and if you walk away from your tagged item, the WalletTag will alert your Smartphone/tablet to let you know you have lost connection between your phone and your wallet/purse etc. Using Google Maps on your Smartphone you can also see where you and your item were separated. Lost your phone or tablet? Press the button on your WalletTag, your device will ring to help you locate it. 

  Cool Bonus: the WalletTag is also a Selfie Remote for your cell camera! 




  Ideal for iOS, works with Android too. iOS can tag 4 items, Android can tag 2 items.

Availability: Currently the SmartTag is only available in black or Ladybug red.

As we grow this indiegogo campaign, we will issue updates on availability for the other colors. The more backers we achieve the more chances we have of funding the extra colors. As more colors become available you will be emailed prior to shipping to ask if you'd like a different color.

App Updates & Modification
The WalletTag is purposely designed to NOT make a sound, thereby not alerting other people to YOUR cash and credit cards. So, as we grow the backers and funding, we will improve the WalletTag App function to include a distance indicator, in addition to the map location function.

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>When Amber was nineteen years old, her mother passed away from cancer and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">butterflies became a symbol for her mother and a way for her family to commemorate her life. Two months after her mom passed away, she moved to Gunnison, Colorado to finish college. After being in Gunnison for two weeks, Amber was given a little puppy, who she named ""Posa"" short for ""Mariposa,"" or butterfly in Spanish.  Posa was Amber's loyal companion for the next fourteen years and a true comfort in her mother's absence.   Posa Apparel was founded in March of 2014 and sadly, Posa passed away in May 2015.  Posa Apparel's name is a tribute to  Amber's mother and her dog, and also to the extended butterfly metaphor of growth and transformation that is incorporated into our products.  </span></p>

Our Story
When Amber was nineteen years old, her mother passed away from cancer and butterflies became a symbol for her mother and a way for her family to commemorate her life. Two months after her mom passed away, she moved to Gunnison, Colorado to finish college. After being in Gunnison for two weeks, Amber was given a little puppy, who she named ""Posa"" short for ""Mariposa,"" or butterfly in Spanish.  Posa was Amber's loyal companion for the next fourteen years and a true comfort in her mother's absence.   Posa Apparel was founded in March of 2014 and sadly, Posa passed away in May 2015.  Posa Apparel's name is a tribute to  Amber's mother and her dog, and also to the extended butterfly metaphor of growth and transformation that is incorporated into our products.

Wrapping the Posa is easy.  Simply place one side behind your neck, wrap the remaining side around the front of your face, lining up the zipper in the center.  Wrap the other side behind your neck and around the opposite shoulder.  Place both ends through each of the straps, and unzip the Posa to your desired level of exposure.


ECO-FRIENDLY PACKAGING

Each Posa is packaged in a band made of plantable seed paper that can later be planted to grow beautiful wild flowers! It is extremely important to us to be a socially conscience company that believes in providing high quality luxury products, while remaining eco-friendly.

<p>We are based in capital of <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo</b>. <span>The theme of our work is related</span> to the fascinating history of our country.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a melting pot of many different cultures, a 
bridge between East and West. The tourists experience here is like 
nowhere else; from Roman times to the reign of the Bosnian Kings;from 
the Ottoman Period, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Yugoslavian era 
with Marshal Tito as its leader. Every year more then a million tourists come to Bosnia, and have a time of their life. We give them opportunity to<span> take part of<span> Bosnian story</span> with them, <span>when they return to their homes.</span></span> Good quality, low price,<span></span> light weight  and with interesting story to tell, <span>our products are ideal souvenirs for tourists.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>With our modern designs we will tell stories about Kings and Queens,
 rise and fall of an Empires and Rulers, stories about Culture, Wars, 
Customs, Sport, Tradition and all other interesting events that took 
place in<b> Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>. The clothes we all wear everyday is the best way to share that beautiful story with the world.</p>
<p>Last summer we have covered two different periods of time with our three designs<b>.</b></p>
<p>One of them  is<b> </b>telling the story of <b>Sarajevo Winter Olympics</b>, held in 1984.<span> Under the motto Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger), Sarajevo became an Olympic city. </span><span>14th Winter Olympic Games were declared the best organized until then.</span> Sarajevo was the capital of the world these days. <br/></p>
The other two designs are representing the time when Bosnia was a kingdom.  <span>Every kingdom has a king, so the Bosnia had one! His name was <b>Tvrtko I Kontromanich</b>.</span> The story of him is one of the most interesting stories in the European history. <br/><br/>
<p>T<span>he main motive</span><span> in this two designs is <em>lily flower</em>! </span><span> Not a french lily, </span>but<b> <em>Lilium bosniacum</em></b> (authentic Bosnian Lily). It was a symbol of  royal dynasty of Kotromanich.<span><span> The coat of arms of the Kings of Bosnia consisted of a blue shield with <em>six golden lilies</em> displayed around a white bend, and it survived to this day as a symbol of Bosniaks. </span></span><span><span>Although</span> it is not official flag of Bosnia, in hearts of many it is, so </span>you can see it in the the stands whenever Bosnia National Team is playing, even when<b> </b>Edin Dzeko, Miralem Pjanic, Asmir Begović, Mirza Teletović, and many others <span>perform</span> for their clubs, or when Adnan Ćatić(Felix Sturm) <span>works his magic</span> in the boxing ring. <br/></p>
<p> Through the past  many empires were naive enough to think they can rule the crude Bosnian land. Every single of them brought the peace of their identity and left it in there while retreating. As a result , Bosnia became a complex mixture of Mediterranean, Byzantine, Ottoman and Central European cultures, with many stories to be told. <span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>We are happy to combine modern fashion with history and present interesting clothing <span></span></span><span>that is able to tell these stories<span> in a </span></span>in a <em>whole new way</em>.<br/></p>

Also, <span>if we achieve the given campaign goal ($ 2500), we will be able to</span> significantly <span>reduce prices</span> of final products.  Last summer<span> our offer included</span> just white t-shirts, and four available designs.

</div></div>","Last summer our little team launched a clothing line called Patrian Clothing.  Go to our Facebook page, or webpage and check out what we did back then. It was pretty big deal, we sold more then 100 pieces of t-shirts in two months of our trial, and every single customer was really happy. Then we took a longer break over the winter, to create new designs, and extend the offer.  It's time to get back, but we need a little help with the costs of developing and manufacturing.








We are based in capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo. The theme of our work is related to the fascinating history of our country.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a melting pot of many different cultures, a 
bridge between East and West. The tourists experience here is like 
nowhere else; from Roman times to the reign of the Bosnian Kings;from 
the Ottoman Period, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Yugoslavian era 
with Marshal Tito as its leader. Every year more then a million tourists come to Bosnia, and have a time of their life. We give them opportunity to take part of Bosnian story with them, when they return to their homes. Good quality, low price, light weight  and with interesting story to tell, our products are ideal souvenirs for tourists.











With our modern designs we will tell stories about Kings and Queens,
 rise and fall of an Empires and Rulers, stories about Culture, Wars, 
Customs, Sport, Tradition and all other interesting events that took 
place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The clothes we all wear everyday is the best way to share that beautiful story with the world.
Last summer we have covered two different periods of time with our three designs.
One of them  is telling the story of Sarajevo Winter Olympics, held in 1984. Under the motto Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger), Sarajevo became an Olympic city. 14th Winter Olympic Games were declared the best organized until then. Sarajevo was the capital of the world these days. 
The other two designs are representing the time when Bosnia was a kingdom.  Every kingdom has a king, so the Bosnia had one! His name was Tvrtko I Kontromanich. The story of him is one of the most interesting stories in the European history. 
The main motive in this two designs is lily flower!  Not a french lily, but Lilium bosniacum (authentic Bosnian Lily). It was a symbol of  royal dynasty of Kotromanich. The coat of arms of the Kings of Bosnia consisted of a blue shield with six golden lilies displayed around a white bend, and it survived to this day as a symbol of Bosniaks. Although it is not official flag of Bosnia, in hearts of many it is, so you can see it in the the stands whenever Bosnia National Team is playing, even when Edin Dzeko, Miralem Pjanic, Asmir Begović, Mirza Teletović, and many others perform for their clubs, or when Adnan Ćatić(Felix Sturm) works his magic in the boxing ring. 
 Through the past  many empires were naive enough to think they can rule the crude Bosnian land. Every single of them brought the peace of their identity and left it in there while retreating. As a result , Bosnia became a complex mixture of Mediterranean, Byzantine, Ottoman and Central European cultures, with many stories to be told. 
We are happy to combine modern fashion with history and present interesting clothing that is able to tell these stories in a in a whole new way.





 
This is where you jump in. We are just couple of students, and  most of our money is spent on the first phase of the project. So we need to fundraise. All the money we get will be wisely spent to enable us finish the development process and start manufacturing new products. Also, if we achieve the given campaign goal ($ 2500), we will be able to significantly reduce prices of final products.  Last summer our offer included just white t-shirts, and four available designs. This year you will be able to choose between 4 available colors, and except t-shirts our ofter will include: polo shirts, hoodies and caps.Also, the custom label (booklet) goes with every product, with interesting story related to the design.Five different designs are ready, and will be presented in May, 2015. Other designs will be developed with your help and if we reach our goal, all products will be available for sale on 15th of June 2015. 




Your support will enable us to buy the components and start manufacturing  of our summer collection.
$2,200 will be reserved for product development, manufacturing, fulfilling campaign orders. That includes:
producing materials for our clothing line here in BiH.
buying graphic tablet that will help us doing better designs
printing labels at the factory
paying professional photographer, so we can present our new designs
printing and sewing expenses
extension of our company registration
extension of our web domain and hosting
online and offline advertising

The remaining $300 will be reserved for Indigogo's fee and other expenses.







The most wanted models from ""2014 collection"" are available for you as a Perks, together with some great surprises. 
If we don't reach our target funding we will borrow the remaining funds 
to make sure that you still receive your items. This option will 
significantly compromise the rate 
at which our business and range can grow (hence this campaign) but it is
 the only other option available to us.

</div></div>","Lipscani was created to tell the story of my country and heritage, with prints that illustrate stories of an Art Nouveau era. 
One of the most important points in our journey is to build a sustainable company, that relies mostly on working with local suppliers, showcasing the quality of Portuguese craftsmanship.

The Reason for this campaign

We need help to come up with the funds to start exporting and showcase our work in an international trade-fair show. Because we started this brand very small, we need help to  to show our brand to a higher number of people.



Why is this important


At this moment, Portugal’s leather shoe and accessories industry represents 3.8 percent of the global leather goods trade. However, we still lack domestic brands with history and global recognition. As a country we need more people that will bet on creating the path to make Portugal a global brand.


One in every 3 Portuguese below the age of 25 is neither working nor studying. When I started my brand, I was also unemployed, and this campaign is a way to open my personal experience to others.  I hope that others feel encouraged to also start their own campaign for their projects and share their story too. 


Our goal is to raise awareness and to open a dialogue with other entrepreneurs, team up with similar Portuguese companies that might see my campaign and that might want to join us in doing a trade fair or a project together involving global distribution.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>China is Tricky <br/>Though we have everything lined up, the design perfected, the features tested, I am always concerned about China. It is not a quality concern as Armor Manufacturing has been using the same top quality bag maker for the past 20 years. It is the distance!</p>
<p>Because China is on the other side of the world, everything takes so much time. Fortunately we have the most difficult elements finalized. One can never tell though if another larger bag maker that this manufacturer supplies will call in a favor to expedite an order bumping us out of line or to the back of the line.</p>
<p>The other concern I have is our pending patents. We do not want anyone to copy all the work we have done and the intellectual property we want to own. This will not directly effect the production, the quality, or any other factor of the product! It will only effect us being able to be exclusive in our efforts.</p>

Die einzelnen Futterschalen können somit mit individuellem Futter bestückt und minutengenau Ihren Lieblingen serviert werden. So erhält jede Katze genau das Futter, das für sie von ihnen vorgesehen ist. Geeignet für die sichere Versorgung von <b>bis zu sieben Katzen</b>!<span><br/></span><span><span>

</h2>Genauso wie jeder Katzenbesitzer unterschiedlich ist, sind es auch unsere Fellnasen. Für echte Naschkatzen ist diese Funktion klasse, da sie <b>jederzeit zwischendurch Fressen können</b>, solange bis ihre Futterportion alle ist, oder die nächste Futterzeit aktiviert wird. Andere Salonlöwen haben dabei keine Chance auf „Mundraub“.  Aber auch ganz grundsätzlich entspricht die mehrfach tägliche Fütterung den natürlichen Fressgewohnheiten einer Katze. Denn im Gegensatz zu Hunden haben Katzen keinen stark dehnbaren Magen, sondern fressen natürlicherweise häufiger am Tag.<br/><span><span><span><br/><span><i>-&gt;&gt; <a href=""#Navigation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zurück nach oben</a></i></span></span>

Bei herkömmlichen Produkten zur Fütterung von Katzen ist oftmals die nicht sichere Verwahrung der Futterportionen zu beobachten. Der CATSOMAT II trägt dieser Herausforderung mit einer absolut <b>„einbruchsicheren“ Konstruktion </b>Rechnung. So ist das verwendete Material des Korpus nicht nur hochwertig verarbeitet, sondern auch durch einen nur durch Menschenhand öffnenden zweifachen Schließmechanismus im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes „verriegelt“. <br/><span><br/></span><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984440/files/20140822123123-separator.jpg?1415087627"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px;"">Mit Stromausfallsystem<span><br/></span></span><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984433/files/20140822123123-separator.jpg?1415087399"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span>
</div><div>Für den (unwahrscheinlichen) Fall, dass während des aktivierten Futtermodus des CATSOMAT einmal der Strom ausfallen sollte, haben wir ein <b>Stromausfallsystem installiert</b>. Durch ein integriertes Akkusystem, das im voll aufgeladenen Zustand insgesamt ca. 60 Stunden Versorgungssicherheit leistet, können Sie sich stets darauf verlassen, dass alle von Ihnen programmierten Futterzeiten von Ihrem CATSOMAT zuverlässig eingehalten werden. Das einzige, was wir während des Akkubetriebes systemtechnisch deaktiviert haben, ist die Kühlung (inkl. Lüftung) und die Vorwärmfunktion. Sämtliche anderen Funktionen Ihres CATSOMAT bleiben intakt.</div><div>

<li>Fliegenlarven oder ähnliches - insbesondere im Sommer - haben dank des abgeschlossenen Deckels wenig Chancen. Ihre Katzen werden es Ihnen danken!</li>
<li>Der CATSOMAT bringt Ihnen ein Stück Freiheit zurück, da Sie zumindest die Fütterung zuverlässig und sicher „delegieren“ können. Egal ob Sie zu Hause sind oder nicht!</li>
<li>Durch den Einsatz des CATSOMAT ist zukünftig keine aufwändige Organisation von sog. Katzensittern (Nachbarn, Bekannte, Verwandte, etc.), wenn Sie z.B. einmal länger arbeiten müssen oder am Wochenende einmal ohne ihren Liebling verreisen wollen oder gar müssen, nicht mehr nötig</li>
<li>Ihre Privatsphäre bleibt durch unser vollautomatisches Fütterungssystem unangetastet, da Sie keinen Haustürschlüssel aus der Hand geben müssen.<br/><br/>

<p>Denn erste  Marktstudien brachten zu Tage, dass alle am Markt erhältlichen Produkte und Möglichkeiten alles andere als dem heutigen Zeitgeist entsprechen. </p>
<p><span>Zusammen mit Mitgliedern seiner Familie und einem engagierten Team aus Ingenieuren und Produktdesigner</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">n und vielen weiteren engagierten Helfern entwickelte er den ersten CATSOMAT Schritt für Schritt zur Marktreife.</span></p>
<p><span>Am 17.Juni 2011 war es endlich soweit: der erste CATSOMAT wurde am deutschen Markt im Rahmen der Maintier 2011 eingeführt und wird über die dafür eigens gegründete <b>CATSOMAT GmbH &amp; Co. Pet Products KG </b>erfolgreich vermarktet.</span></p>

</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Arbeitet der CATSOMAT zuverlässig allein, wenn ich nicht zuhause bin? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i>Ja! Die Hauptfunktion des CATSOMAT besteht darin, Ihren Lieblingen zum richtigen Zeitpunkt hygienisch gekühltes frisches Futter zu servieren - immer dann, wenn Sie dies berufsbedingt oder aus anderen Gründen nicht selber bewerkstelligen können. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Wie lange bleibt das Futter frisch?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Nass- und Frischfutter sind verderblich. Der CATSOMAT gewährleistet, dass Nassfutter genauso lange seine Frische beibehält wie das beim sachgerechten Lagern einer geöffneten Frischfutterdose im Kühlschrank (6°C) der Fall ist. Im Allgemeinen rund 3-5 Tage bei Dosenfutter und bis zu 3 Tage bei vorgefrorenem Frischfleisch (Barf). Ein sicherer Umgang mit frischem Futter sollten grundsätzlich immer gewährleistet sein. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Kann ich den CATSOMAT mit rohem Fleisch (Barf) verwenden?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i>Ja. Aber bitte beachten Sie, das rohes Futter weder haltbar gemacht noch anderweitig behandelt ist, so dass es im Vergleich zu Dosenfutter wesentlich schneller verdirbt. Bei der Verwendung von Rohfleisch empfehlen wir daher, die Futterrationen im angefrorenem Zustand in die Futterschale zu füllen, um maximale Haltbarkeit zu gewährleisten. Grundsätzlich sollte vorgefrorenes Rohfutter nicht länger als drei Tage im Gerät verbleiben.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Ist der CATSOMAT teuer im Betrieb?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Nicht wirklich. Der Stromverbrauch ist vergleichbar mit einer 90-Watt Glühbirne. Dies entspricht damit nur einem Bruchteil dessen, was ein handelsüblicher Kühlschrank verbraucht. <i><span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Ist das 'Plastik' der Futterschalen für die Lagerung von Futter geeignet? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Nicht jedes Plastik das Sie kennen ist das gleiche. Für die Futterschale des Geräts verwenden wir ausschließlich Polycarbonat, eine sehr robuste und außerordentlich langlebige Plastiksorte. Daher sind unsere Futterschalen spülmaschinengeeignet und absolut lebensmittelecht.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Können sich mit der Zeit Bakterien in der Futterschale ansammeln?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i> Die Futterschalen sind kratzfest, wie bei Kunststoffschüsseln im Kücheneinsatz üblich und bestehen aus lebensmittelechtem Polycarbonat. Durch die Möglichkeit der Reinigung in der Spülmaschine können sich keine Bakterien ansammeln. Der CATSOMAT I bewährt sich in dieser Hinsicht bereits seit über 3 Jahren im tagtäglichen Einsatz. Die Futterschalen sind absolut sicher. für die regelmäßige Reinigung dieser müssen Sie natürlich selber sorgen.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>

</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Funktioniert die CATSOMAT II Smartphone App auch, wenn ich keine Internetverbindung und keinen WLAN-fähigen Router zuhause habe?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Nein.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Kann ich mich mit der CATSOMAT II Smartphone App über eventuell auftretende Probleme, wie z.B. einen Stromausfall, informieren lassen? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i>Sobald Sie eine Verbindung via Internet zum Gerät haben, können Sie sich jederzeit über den Zustand des CATSOMAT informieren lassen. Über die geplante App werden Sie sehr vielfältige Steuerungs- und Kontrollmöglichkeiten haben. Immer dann, wenn Sie selber nicht zuhause sind.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div><b>Q: Wird das Gerät in der Lage sein, mich darüber zu informieren wenn meine Katze frisst? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Ja das ist geplant. Und besonders bei Katzen mit besonderen, gesundheitlichen Anforderungen ist das ein wesentlicher Vorteil. In diesem Zusammenhang wird es möglich sein, sich immer dann, wenn Ihre Katze frisst, eine Benachrichtigung auf Ihr Smartphone zuschicken zu lassen. Und jederzeit können Sie über die kostenfreie Smartphone App Ihrer Katze beim Fressen Zuschauen, Zuhören oder sogar mit ihr Sprechen. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Wird es möglich sein, mir eine Art ""Futterhistorie"" meiner Katzen anzuschauen? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Ja, jedes Mal wenn Ihre Katze den RFID Mechanismus aktiviert, wird für einen Zeitraum von bis zu 5 Tagen protokolliert. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Wie verhält es sich mich der Internet- und Datensicherheit? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Gut das Sie nachfragen. Grundsätzlich sollte immer darauf geachtet werden, das Geräte, die sich mit dem Internet verbinden alle aktuellen Sicherheits- und Verschlüsselungsstandards berücksichtigen. Sämtliche internetfähige CATSOMAT II Funktionen werden neusten Sicherheits- und Verschlüsselungsstandards entsprechen. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Ich weiß nicht, ob meine Katze bereits einen Mikrochip hat - Wie kann ich das prüfen?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i> Für den Fall, dass Sie beispielsweise eine Katze aus einem Tierheim adoptiert haben, ist es sehr wahrscheinlich das diese bereits einen Mikrochip hat. Sog. Rassekatzen sind normalerweise grundsätzlich gechippt. Im Zweifelsfall kann Ihr Tierarzt mit einem Erkennungsgerät ganz fix prüfen, ob einer implantiert ist oder nicht. </i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div><i>Und wenn Sie dann bald stolzer Besitzer eines CATSOMAT II sind, können Sie am Display ablesen, ob das Gerät Ihre Fellnasen erkennt oder nicht. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></div>
<p>
</p>
<div><b>Q: Und was ist, wenn meine Katze keinen RFID-Mikrochip hat? Oder ich einfach keinen implantieren lassen möchte? </b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i>Mittlerweile gibt es ganz gute und kostengünstige RFID-Mikrochip Anhänger auf dem Markt. Der Einsatz am Halsband ist aber nicht wirklich zu empfehlen, da einerseits die Gefahr besteht, dass Ihre Fellnase irgendwo ungewollt hängen bleibt und im schlimmsten Fall erstickt, anderseits Halsbänder mit Notfallöffnung sich zu leicht lösen können, wodurch die Katze dann vom Gerät nicht mehr erkannt wird. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Grundsätzlich empfehlen wir daher das Chippen - das tut der Katze absolut nicht weh und bietet ihr und Ihnen viele weitere Vorteile. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Ich möchte weder einen RFID-Transponder Chip implantieren, noch einen Anhänger verwenden. Funktioniert das Gerät dann dennoch?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""> </b><i>Unser Automat kann auch so programmiert werden, dass er die Futterausgabe nach den von Ihnen individuell eingegebenen Futterzeiten vornimmt. Dafür ist keine RFID-Erkennung notwendig. Allerdings verzichten Sie damit auf eine Vielzahl von wesentlichen Vorteilen und Möglichkeiten des CATSOMAT II, wie z.B. die Zuordnung von Futter - individuell für jede Katze. Das sollten Sie bedenken.</i> </div><br/><h3>

Tech for Pet


 
Alle technischen Highlights im Detail 

Der CATSOMAT II ist mit keinem anderen Katzenfutterautomaten zu vergleichen. Derzeitige Nass-Futterautomaten (mit Ausnahme unseres CATSOMAT II Vorgängermodells) gewährleisten in der Regel keine konstante und zuverlässige Kühlung des Futters. Denn deren Kühlung erfolgt dabei in der Regel nur über Kühlpads oder Eiswürfel. Im Gegensatz dazu ist der CATSOMAT II mit einer sogenannten thermo-elektrischen Kühlung ausgestattet, die ähnlich dem Kühlschrankprinzip funktioniert und dabei das Nass- und Frischfutter Ihrer Lieblinge stets frisch und appetitlich hält. (Kühltemperaturbereich: 6° bis 20° Celsius einstellbar).Für sensible Naschkatzen auch mit VorwärmfunktionDa nicht alle Fellnasen gekühltes Futter vertragen oder mögen, haben wir darüber hinaus eine innovative Aufwärmfunktion integriert, mit dem die jeweilige neue Futterportion vor der Futterzeit mittels einer Vorwärmplatte von unten erwärmt werden kann. Je nach Geschmack und Vorliebe Ihrer Fellnase: Die Vorwärmfunktion kann individuell aktiviert oder aber auch komplett deaktiviert werden - zum Beispiel immer dann, wenn Sie auch einmal Trockenfutter füttern möchten.Mit dem CATSOMAT II wird die sichere Versorgung mehrerer Katzen in einem Haushalt zum Kinderspiel. 
Der besondere Clou:
Fasst jede Katze wurde vom Tierarzt mit einem sog. Transponder gechipt. Der CATSOMAT II erkennt dank seiner innovativen RFID Mikrochip Technologie jede einzelne Katze anhand ihres RFID-Mikrochips/ Transponders. Die einzelnen Futterschalen können somit mit individuellem Futter bestückt und minutengenau Ihren Lieblingen serviert werden. So erhält jede Katze genau das Futter, das für sie von ihnen vorgesehen ist. Geeignet für die sichere Versorgung von bis zu sieben Katzen!


Gerade ältere Katzen benötigen kleinere Futterportionen über den Tag verteilt. Bei kranken Katzen ist die regelmäßige und sichere Einnahme ihrer Medikamente (überlebens-)notwendig. In Kombination mit unserer RFID-Technologie sorgt eine intelligente Verschlussmechanik dafür, dass nach der Fütterung die Futterschale automatisch wieder verschlossen und weiterhin gekühlt wird.  Somit können sich Katzen ihre Futterration selber einteilen und gerade bei kranken Katzen ist gewährleistet, dass nur sie die Portionen erhalten, denen Medikamente beigefügt sind. 

Und auch für Naschkatzen ein Vergnügen
Genauso wie jeder Katzenbesitzer unterschiedlich ist, sind es auch unsere Fellnasen. Für echte Naschkatzen ist diese Funktion klasse, da sie jederzeit zwischendurch Fressen können, solange bis ihre Futterportion alle ist, oder die nächste Futterzeit aktiviert wird. Andere Salonlöwen haben dabei keine Chance auf „Mundraub“.  Aber auch ganz grundsätzlich entspricht die mehrfach tägliche Fütterung den natürlichen Fressgewohnheiten einer Katze. Denn im Gegensatz zu Hunden haben Katzen keinen stark dehnbaren Magen, sondern fressen natürlicherweise häufiger am Tag.->> zurück nach oben
Sie haben ""nur"" eine Katze oder Freigänger?
Oder Hunde leben mit im Haushalt?


Kein Problem! Auch wenn der CATSOMAT II seine besondere Stärke bei Mehrkatzenhaushalten ""ausspielt"", ist er auch dort besonders hilfreich, wo beispielsweise auch Hunde mit im Haushalt leben. Und sichergestellt werden soll, das nicht die Hunde, sondern die Katze an das für sie bestimmte Futter gelangt. Das gleiche gilt für Freigängerkatzen, die ja auch gerne einmal ""Besuch"" mit nach Hause bringen.Natürlich ist unser Katzenfutter-Vollautomat aber auch genauso für die Versorgung von nur einer Fellnase geeignet. Denn auch diese wird es lieben, mehrfach am Tag ihre Futterportionen stets in bester Qualität zu erhalten.Sie sehen, der CATSOMAT ist auf jeden Fall die richtige Wahl!So einfach zu bedienen - von zuhause und überall!
... kinderleicht per Touchscreen
Sämtliche Einstellungen des Geräts sind über unsere intuitive Touchscreen-Bedienung kinderleicht und super fix vorzunehmen. Und natürlich ist dieser so konzipiert, dass selbst die schlausten Fellnasen keine Chance haben, ihr eigenes Programm selber einzustellen.


... und dank WiFi und CATSOMAT App

Der CATSOMAT II ist weltweit der einzige Nass-Futterautomat, den man aus der Ferne, jederzeit und von jedem Ort per Desktop-Rechner, Tablet oder Smartphone steuern kann.  Dies wird durch die von uns integrierte WiFi Funktionalität ermöglich. Im Zusammenspiel mit der geplanten CATSOMAT App können Sie bei längerer Abwesenheit Futterzeiten, Kühltemperaturen, die Zuordnung der Mahlzeiten zu den einzelnen Katzen, etc. von überall - egal wo sie sich gerade aufhalten - kontrollieren, neu programmieren, etc. Lediglich die Befüllung des Geräts muss per Hand vor Ort erfolgen.

Für echte Feinschmecker mit Lust auf individuelle Lieblingsmenüs

Zaubern Sie Ihren Lieblingen richtige Katzenmenüs auf ""den Teller"" - denn Katzen lieben neben der regelmäßigen Fütterung auch echte Abwechslung. Standardmäßig ist unser CATSOMAT II mit einer Futterschale ausgestattet, die insgesamt 7 Futterkammern mit jeweils ca. 0,4 Liter Füllgewicht fassen. Diesen können Sie für jede Katze individuell mit ihrem Lieblingsfutter und/oder mit richtigen Katzenmenüs bestücken. Und natürlich ist diese einerseits lebensmittelecht, säureresistent und ist darüber hinaus spülmaschinenfest. Bei der Programmierung können Sie dann einfach verschiedene Standardmenüs (z.B. das ""Wochenend-Leckerschlecker-Menü"") programmieren und aktivieren. Ihre Lieblingen werden Ihnen das danken und die Zeit bis zu Ihrer Rückkehr wird dann nicht ganz so lang.->> 

zurück nach obenFür das gute Gefühl, dass jederzeit alles in Ordnung ist


Mit der integrierten Kamera haben Sie jederzeit Ihre Fellnasen ""im Blick"". Über diese kann man auch aus der Ferne einen Blick auf seine Lieblinge werfen, um sicherzugehen, dass sie ihr Futter brav gegessen haben.


Ob einzelne Bilder oder Realtime-Videoaufnahmen - es ist einfach schön zu sehen, wie tierisch entspannt Ihre Lieblinge mit dem CATSOMAT II sind. Per SMS können sie sich informieren lassen, wenn Ihre Katze frisst und dank der App können Sie Ihr jederzeit beim Fressen ""live"" zusehen und sogar mit ihr sprechen (siehe auch nachfolgendes Feature)



Mit Ihren Lieblingen sprechen - auch dann wenn Sie nicht zuhause sind

Mit unser Lockruf-Aufnahme Funktion können Sie für jeden Liebling individuell einen Lockruf über das integrierte Mikrophon aufsprechen, der dann kurz vor der neuen Fütterung abgespielt wird. Katzen lieben Rituale und Sie werden erstaunt sein, wie happy Ihre Lieblinge schauen, wenn Sie Ihre Stimme hören.Aber wir legen noch etwas drauf! 


Mit dem CATSOMAT II können Sie Ihre Lieblinge zu den Futterzeiten nicht nur individuell rufen, sondern dank der WLAN Verbindung über eine integrierte Lautsprecher- und Mikrophonfunktion, sogar aus der Ferne mit ihnen sprechen. Und dank des eingebauten Mikros hören sie auch, dass Ihre Lieblinge einfach tierisch entspannt sind und sich über Ihre Stimme freuen...





Mit einbruchsicherer Verschlusstechnik
Bei herkömmlichen Produkten zur Fütterung von Katzen ist oftmals die nicht sichere Verwahrung der Futterportionen zu beobachten. Der CATSOMAT II trägt dieser Herausforderung mit einer absolut „einbruchsicheren“ Konstruktion Rechnung. So ist das verwendete Material des Korpus nicht nur hochwertig verarbeitet, sondern auch durch einen nur durch Menschenhand öffnenden zweifachen Schließmechanismus im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes „verriegelt“. Mit Stromausfallsystem
Für den (unwahrscheinlichen) Fall, dass während des aktivierten Futtermodus des CATSOMAT einmal der Strom ausfallen sollte, haben wir ein Stromausfallsystem installiert. Durch ein integriertes Akkusystem, das im voll aufgeladenen Zustand insgesamt ca. 60 Stunden Versorgungssicherheit leistet, können Sie sich stets darauf verlassen, dass alle von Ihnen programmierten Futterzeiten von Ihrem CATSOMAT zuverlässig eingehalten werden. Das einzige, was wir während des Akkubetriebes systemtechnisch deaktiviert haben, ist die Kühlung (inkl. Lüftung) und die Vorwärmfunktion. Sämtliche anderen Funktionen Ihres CATSOMAT bleiben intakt.

Form follows function - 100% katzengerecht und stylisch zugleich


Bei grundsätzlichem Produktdesign sind wir dem Motto ""form follows function"" gefolgt. Dabei lag die besondere Herausforderung darin, einerseits, ein Gerät zu entwickeln, dass zu 100% katzengerecht ist. Angefangen von verletzungsfreien Materialien und Funktionen bis hin zum Einsatz lebensmittelechter und säureresistenter (wie z.B. bei der Futterschale) Materialien.Anderseits ist es uns gelungen ein Gerät zu entwickeln, dass man sich auch gerne in seinen Haushalt stellt, da es formschön- und zeitlos ist.Zunächst wird der CATSOMAT in einem edlen Grauton produziert. Zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt können wir uns sehr gut vorstellen, auch andere stylische Farbvarianten bis hin zu einzigartigen, kundenspezifischen Geräten anzubieten.  Wer nicht solange warten möchte, der sollte sich unseren ""Special Color PERK"" weiter unten anschauen! ->>

Durch den Einsatz des CATSOMAT ist zukünftig keine aufwändige Organisation von sog. Katzensittern (Nachbarn, Bekannte, Verwandte, etc.), wenn Sie z.B. einmal länger arbeiten müssen oder am Wochenende einmal ohne ihren Liebling verreisen wollen oder gar müssen, nicht mehr nötig
Ihre Privatsphäre bleibt durch unser vollautomatisches Fütterungssystem unangetastet, da Sie keinen Haustürschlüssel aus der Hand geben müssen.






Warum Sie darauf vertrauen können, dass der CATSOMAT II nicht nur eine Vision bleibt!?Bereits mit dem ersten CATSOMAT  haben wir vor rund 3 Jahren den ersten thermoelektrisch-kühlenden Katzenfutterautomat auf den Markt gebracht. „Damals“ wie heute immer noch eine Weltneuheit. Mit diesem Gerät konnten wir vielen Menschen eine echte Lösung für die sichere Versorgung ihrer Lieblinge ermöglichen. Auf unseren Erfolg wollten wir uns aber nicht ausruhen. Insofern war es nur konsequent, auch auf Basis eines regen Austauschs mit unseren glücklichen CATSOMAT Verwendern, unser Produkt noch optimaler den Bedürfnissen einer modernen und zukunftsorientierten Fütterung anzupassen.Der 2011er CATSOMAT im geöffneten, befüllten Zustand


Bereits dieser CATSOMAT wurde in zahlreichen Produkttests   auf Herz und Nieren getestet und bewährt sich bereits seit 3 Jahren bei vielen glücklichen CATSOMAT Freunden.Und auch bei nahezu allen derzeitigen Produkttests glänzt der CATSOMAT I als Testsieger.Aktuell auch beim großen Katzenfutterautomaten Test bei hundkatzemaus (TV-Sender VOX), bei dem unser Gerät auch als Testsieger überzeugen konnte. ->>

   About us - Die Story hinter der Story
Die Idee zum CATSOMAT entstand wie bei vielen Gründern und Innovatoren ""ganz klassisch"": Es war Donald R. Pilz (51), der - nach mehr als 20 Jahren erfolgreicher Tätigkeit in führenden Managementpositionen der Transport- und Logistikindustrie eine neue unternehmerische Herausforderung suchte.Als dann vor einigen Jahren in seiner unternehmerischen Familie der erste Prototyp des CATSOMAT I entwickelt wurde, reizte das den Unternehmergeist in Donald Pilz, das Projekt selber zu verwirklichen.
Denn erste  Marktstudien brachten zu Tage, dass alle am Markt erhältlichen Produkte und Möglichkeiten alles andere als dem heutigen Zeitgeist entsprechen. 
Zusammen mit Mitgliedern seiner Familie und einem engagierten Team aus Ingenieuren und Produktdesignern und vielen weiteren engagierten Helfern entwickelte er den ersten CATSOMAT Schritt für Schritt zur Marktreife.
Am 17.Juni 2011 war es endlich soweit: der erste CATSOMAT wurde am deutschen Markt im Rahmen der Maintier 2011 eingeführt und wird über die dafür eigens gegründete CATSOMAT GmbH & Co. Pet Products KG erfolgreich vermarktet.

FAQ



Q: Warum ist der CATSOMAT teurer als andere derzeitige Futterautomaten?



A:  Genauso wie Sie als verantwortungsbewusster Katzenliebhaber keine Kompromisse machen, wenn es um das Wohlbefinden und die Gesundheit Ihres Partners Katze geht, wollen wir dies bei der Entwicklung und Produktion des CATSOMAT II auch nicht machen. 
Unser Anspruch ist es, dass beste Gerät zu entwickeln, was jederzeit zu 100% zuverlässig funktioniert. Basierend auf einer technologisch absolut ausgereiften Entwicklung und dem Einsatz hochwertiger Komponenten: wir möchten Ihnen den weltweit besten Futterautomat für Katzen anbieten.
Und auch Sie nutzen sicherlich bereits auch schon eine Vielzahl anderer Dinge, die Ihnen das Leben vereinfachen: iPhones? Hochwertige Küchengeräte? Oder wie schaut es mit dem tollen Flachbildfernseher aus? All diese Dinge sind dafür entwickelt worden, um uns das Leben ein Stückchen einfacher zu machen und Freude zu bereiten. Und auch CATSOMAT wird Ihr Leben ein bisschen mehr vereinfachen und Ihnen helfen Ihre Katze gesund zu halten! 
Q: Entstehen mir nach dem Kauf eines CATSOMAT Vorverkaufs-Produktperk tatsächlich keine zusätzliche Kosten?
A: Nein. Mit dem Kauf eines Vorverkaufs-Produktperk sichern Sie sich ein Gerät zu den jeweils angebotenen Konditionen. Darüber hinaus entstehen innerhalb Deutschland und der EU keine zusätzlichen Versandkosten. Weitere Hinweise entnehmen Sie bitte dem Punkt ""Risikohinweise und Konditionen"" 




Q: Arbeitet der CATSOMAT zuverlässig allein, wenn ich nicht zuhause bin? 



A: Ja! Die Hauptfunktion des CATSOMAT besteht darin, Ihren Lieblingen zum richtigen Zeitpunkt hygienisch gekühltes frisches Futter zu servieren - immer dann, wenn Sie dies berufsbedingt oder aus anderen Gründen nicht selber bewerkstelligen können. 



Q: Wie lange bleibt das Futter frisch?



A: Nass- und Frischfutter sind verderblich. Der CATSOMAT gewährleistet, dass Nassfutter genauso lange seine Frische beibehält wie das beim sachgerechten Lagern einer geöffneten Frischfutterdose im Kühlschrank (6°C) der Fall ist. Im Allgemeinen rund 3-5 Tage bei Dosenfutter und bis zu 3 Tage bei vorgefrorenem Frischfleisch (Barf). Ein sicherer Umgang mit frischem Futter sollten grundsätzlich immer gewährleistet sein. 



Q: Kann ich den CATSOMAT mit rohem Fleisch (Barf) verwenden?



A: Ja. Aber bitte beachten Sie, das rohes Futter weder haltbar gemacht noch anderweitig behandelt ist, so dass es im Vergleich zu Dosenfutter wesentlich schneller verdirbt. Bei der Verwendung von Rohfleisch empfehlen wir daher, die Futterrationen im angefrorenem Zustand in die Futterschale zu füllen, um maximale Haltbarkeit zu gewährleisten. Grundsätzlich sollte vorgefrorenes Rohfutter nicht länger als drei Tage im Gerät verbleiben.  



Q: Ist der CATSOMAT teuer im Betrieb?



A: Nicht wirklich. Der Stromverbrauch ist vergleichbar mit einer 90-Watt Glühbirne. Dies entspricht damit nur einem Bruchteil dessen, was ein handelsüblicher Kühlschrank verbraucht. 



Q: Ist das 'Plastik' der Futterschalen für die Lagerung von Futter geeignet? 



A: Nicht jedes Plastik das Sie kennen ist das gleiche. Für die Futterschale des Geräts verwenden wir ausschließlich Polycarbonat, eine sehr robuste und außerordentlich langlebige Plastiksorte. Daher sind unsere Futterschalen spülmaschinengeeignet und absolut lebensmittelecht.  



Q: Können sich mit der Zeit Bakterien in der Futterschale ansammeln?



A:  Die Futterschalen sind kratzfest, wie bei Kunststoffschüsseln im Kücheneinsatz üblich und bestehen aus lebensmittelechtem Polycarbonat. Durch die Möglichkeit der Reinigung in der Spülmaschine können sich keine Bakterien ansammeln. Der CATSOMAT I bewährt sich in dieser Hinsicht bereits seit über 3 Jahren im tagtäglichen Einsatz. Die Futterschalen sind absolut sicher. für die regelmäßige Reinigung dieser müssen Sie natürlich selber sorgen.




Q: Funktioniert die CATSOMAT II Smartphone App auch, wenn ich keine Internetverbindung und keinen WLAN-fähigen Router zuhause habe?



A: Nein.



Q: Kann ich mich mit der CATSOMAT II Smartphone App über eventuell auftretende Probleme, wie z.B. einen Stromausfall, informieren lassen? 



A: Sobald Sie eine Verbindung via Internet zum Gerät haben, können Sie sich jederzeit über den Zustand des CATSOMAT informieren lassen. Über die geplante App werden Sie sehr vielfältige Steuerungs- und Kontrollmöglichkeiten haben. Immer dann, wenn Sie selber nicht zuhause sind.



Q: Wird das Gerät in der Lage sein, mich darüber zu informieren wenn meine Katze frisst? 



A: Ja das ist geplant. Und besonders bei Katzen mit besonderen, gesundheitlichen Anforderungen ist das ein wesentlicher Vorteil. In diesem Zusammenhang wird es möglich sein, sich immer dann, wenn Ihre Katze frisst, eine Benachrichtigung auf Ihr Smartphone zuschicken zu lassen. Und jederzeit können Sie über die kostenfreie Smartphone App Ihrer Katze beim Fressen Zuschauen, Zuhören oder sogar mit ihr Sprechen. 



Q: Wird es möglich sein, mir eine Art ""Futterhistorie"" meiner Katzen anzuschauen? 



A: Ja, jedes Mal wenn Ihre Katze den RFID Mechanismus aktiviert, wird für einen Zeitraum von bis zu 5 Tagen protokolliert. 



Q: Wie verhält es sich mich der Internet- und Datensicherheit? 



A: Gut das Sie nachfragen. Grundsätzlich sollte immer darauf geachtet werden, das Geräte, die sich mit dem Internet verbinden alle aktuellen Sicherheits- und Verschlüsselungsstandards berücksichtigen. Sämtliche internetfähige CATSOMAT II Funktionen werden neusten Sicherheits- und Verschlüsselungsstandards entsprechen. 



Q: Ich weiß nicht, ob meine Katze bereits einen Mikrochip hat - Wie kann ich das prüfen?



A:  Für den Fall, dass Sie beispielsweise eine Katze aus einem Tierheim adoptiert haben, ist es sehr wahrscheinlich das diese bereits einen Mikrochip hat. Sog. Rassekatzen sind normalerweise grundsätzlich gechippt. Im Zweifelsfall kann Ihr Tierarzt mit einem Erkennungsgerät ganz fix prüfen, ob einer implantiert ist oder nicht. 



Und wenn Sie dann bald stolzer Besitzer eines CATSOMAT II sind, können Sie am Display ablesen, ob das Gerät Ihre Fellnasen erkennt oder nicht. 


Q: Und was ist, wenn meine Katze keinen RFID-Mikrochip hat? Oder ich einfach keinen implantieren lassen möchte? 



A: Mittlerweile gibt es ganz gute und kostengünstige RFID-Mikrochip Anhänger auf dem Markt. Der Einsatz am Halsband ist aber nicht wirklich zu empfehlen, da einerseits die Gefahr besteht, dass Ihre Fellnase irgendwo ungewollt hängen bleibt und im schlimmsten Fall erstickt, anderseits Halsbänder mit Notfallöffnung sich zu leicht lösen können, wodurch die Katze dann vom Gerät nicht mehr erkannt wird. Grundsätzlich empfehlen wir daher das Chippen - das tut der Katze absolut nicht weh und bietet ihr und Ihnen viele weitere Vorteile. 



Q: Ich möchte weder einen RFID-Transponder Chip implantieren, noch einen Anhänger verwenden. Funktioniert das Gerät dann dennoch?



A: Unser Automat kann auch so programmiert werden, dass er die Futterausgabe nach den von Ihnen individuell eingegebenen Futterzeiten vornimmt. Dafür ist keine RFID-Erkennung notwendig. Allerdings verzichten Sie damit auf eine Vielzahl von wesentlichen Vorteilen und Möglichkeiten des CATSOMAT II, wie z.B. die Zuordnung von Futter - individuell für jede Katze. Das sollten Sie bedenken.

</div>
<div>
<p>OHSOKO originated from my professional life as a sailor of a traditional sailing yacht from 1936. One role I was entrusted with was the maintenance and repair of the leather which protected much of the gear on deck. This skill and craft, passed down through centuries of seafarers lead me to create personal leather items for myself during long stretches upon the ocean, replacing poor quality items I already owned with new, handmade items I knew would now last forever.</p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</div>
<div>6 years later and with my leather skills fully developed, I landed in Bali, Indonesia. Once here I knew I could take my skills further and begin to create more of my pieces and maybe even start a small business.</div>

<p>Our reversible belts are made from the highest quality, ultra durable vegetable-tanned, full-grain leather, the best for belt making. </p>
<p>A unique feature of our belts is that they are made from two pieces of leather, hand stitched back to back with the strongest naturally waxed polyester thread. </p>
<p>By using two pieces of leather we incorporated different leather tans for each side of the belt which means you can reverse the belt to suit your outfit. Light tan one side and dark tan the other. </p>
<p>To achieve this we had to create and manufacture our very own unique, solid brass reversible buckle, this is something we are very proud of, you wont find it anywhere else.</p>
<p><span>By incorporating all these features we were able to create the most durable, non-stretching belt out there. Your belt will never lose shape and will require no adjustment throughout your life time.</span></p>
<p><b>The future of our belts;</b></p>
<p>Our next move with the belts will be to offer more variety of combined leather colours which can be chosen and made specifically to your personal choice with a more varied range of buckle styles cast in a variety of different high-quality metals.</p>

<p>Our Journals have a story of their own. As a perpetual traveller and seafarer I always enjoyed keeping a written journal to record my experiences so that one day my grand children or even great grand children could read through my book and find out who I really was and what I did. This was something I wished I could discover from my past family generations. I figured that by making myself a life lasting journal maybe one day future generations would find my journal and discover who I was. I don't think there's any better way to provide this kind of information other than through a hand written, beautiful leather bound journal.  </p>
<p>The journals are made with top grain, vegetable tanned genuine cows leather, are hand-punched and stitched with waxed polyester thread. Like all of our products your journal will wear and mould beautifully over time and securely store all of your writings, sketches and memories for decades to come.</p>
<p>Each journal comes with a simple natural wooden pencil, inserted into the  holder so you'll never need to search for something to write with. </p>
<p>Not only this but we were able to source fully recycled paper from a local factory that is able to provide us with naturally processed recycled paper with a beautiful textured writing surface, to give your journal even more character in the most environmentally conscious way possible.</p>
<p><b>Limited Edition Journal; </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are also offering a Limited Edition version with multi-coloured waxed thread and personal message option.</span></p>
<p>As with the wallet we'll contact you to discuss exactly what you would like to have personally written inside to complete your order of the most unique journal created just for you. </p>
<p><b>The future of our Journals;</b></p>
<p>We realise that there is a need for journals in varying sizes and colours so as OHSOKO develops then so will our Journal designs. We hope to create a range of leather bound journals in varying thickness's with a choice of coloured recycled papers and leather colours. It really is endless what we can create and we're so excited to start the new designs process.</p>

<div><h3>What's the impact of OHSOKO for the world and for you?</h3></div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449903330/yjfpdb6pvjrddv94kzci.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Its a pretty big question but one which is so relevant to our ethics as a company. We feel so strongly about our impact and the way we want to run our business that it is at the forefront of both our creative and business minds. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>OHSOKO started as a simple way for me to say goodbye to the poor quality, highly priced products that are found in mainstream outlets and brands. Mass production might mean that there's a variety of incredible products to choose from out there but more often than not you have to compromise the quality for these items. </div>
<div>OHSOKO offers lifetime guarantees on all of our products because we strongly believe in making something once, with such genuine quality that there is no need to waste material and time to have to replace an item so soon into its life. That's why we use traditional seafaring techniques because those techniques were developed so that marine leather items could withstand the worse that mother nature could throw at it.</div>
<div>We also pride ourselves in keeping this age-old, often forgotten skill alive, so we hope in our small way we can help retain a small piece of history in each of our products.</div>
<div>The impact for you is that you gain the peace of mind knowing we are here to look after you for life, that you will receive only the highest personal customer service available and that by purchasing our products you are contributing and helping to us to uphold only the best ethics for both our customers and our products alike. An of course, you also get your beautiful, one of a kind, products for life!<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

<div><br/></div>
</div></span></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Nothing is without risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<div>This is something I learnt as a seafarer only too well and the same applies throughout life no matter what you are doing. That includes the challenges and risks we face with OHSOKO. </div>
<div>there's no point in hiding the fact that it has been extremely difficult to get to this point. There have been so many hurdles and relentless challenges to overcome and master before we could ever think of launching a crowd funding campaign. </div>
<div>Producing and manufacturing in Bali alone has its own set of unique challenges with language barriers and difficult logistics to manage in what is still a developing country. Sometimes things happen at a slightly slower pace than in the western world and there's very little you can do about it other than be patient.</div>
<div>Sourcing the best materials can also be very difficult because Bali, as a relatively small island, simply doesn't stock everything we need so we sometimes have to look elsewhere to obtain our materials. </div>
<div>However, once our systems are in place and our suppliers are set we can begin to form structured relationships and find the best, most efficient ways to get what we need. Careful logistics management is paramount for a larger production demand and as we move into this stage we will fine tune all of our processes and logistics until we have the company running like a perfectly oiled wheel. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>When can you expect to get your products?</h3></div>
<div>Whilst we get this off the ground and start to get that wheel turning we hope you will understand that timing can often be slower to start with. That being said we plan to move into full production on 16th February 2016 once our campaign is completed, with the first of our orders being created and shipped from April 1st 2016. By this time we believe that the wheel will be turning smoothly and OHSOKO will be fully fledged!</div>

<div>However, if you like what you see and want to help indirectly then the best way to do it would be to share us on social media or elsewhere. You could simply tell your next door neighbour or friend about what we're trying to do... perhaps they can help and would be interested too?</div>

The background of OHSOKO


OHSOKO originated from my professional life as a sailor of a traditional sailing yacht from 1936. One role I was entrusted with was the maintenance and repair of the leather which protected much of the gear on deck. This skill and craft, passed down through centuries of seafarers lead me to create personal leather items for myself during long stretches upon the ocean, replacing poor quality items I already owned with new, handmade items I knew would now last forever.


6 years later and with my leather skills fully developed, I landed in Bali, Indonesia. Once here I knew I could take my skills further and begin to create more of my pieces and maybe even start a small business.

                         
                        Shot taken from the deck of 'Thendara' back in 2010



OHSOKO was born.....


The Development Process



After 7 months of developing my ideas locally, refining and fine tuning my designs, sourcing the highest quality materials and finding the best people to work with, I decided it was time to start a campaign in order to raise the funds needed to take everything to the next level and start real production. 

At OHSOKO we truly believe in products which are built out of care, passion and honesty and to be able to produce this level of quality and stand by it with lifetime guarantees for all our products is something we take great pride in. 







What this campaign means for OHSOKO


Reaching our campaign figure would be the very start of a dream come true. To this point after years of working on designs and product ideas is massively significant but to receive the funds we're looking for would be beyond words.

It will finally allow us to start the business and make a real and exciting go of it. To create 600 pieces with love and dedication to the cause for beautiful, life-lasting accessories using techniques passed down through generations of seafarers.
From this point on there is no end, OHSOKO will continue to develop and launch new, beautiful products and designs based on only the best themes and ethics for production.   
Where is the funding going and what will you get in return?

We need the funding to develop our small team and expand into a new level of production, essentially moving from 3 leather craftsmen to 6, with a double capacity workshop and upgraded machinery and tools. 

Whilst this is great for OHSOKO, this is also fantastic for Teguh, our Balinese production and manufacturing manager. It will allow him to expand his workshop and provide his team all they need to create incredible products for OHSOKO well into the future.   
Any funds received will also allow us to source and purchase all the materials that we need to produce up to 600 items. Including beautiful handmade packaging made from all natural recycled card and simple but elegant linen product linings to protect each item. 
We will also provide FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING and LIFETIME GUARANTEES for ALL of our products so one purchase means you'll never need to to buy another item like this during your lifetime.

Like all of our products the wallet is sewn by hand using extremely strong, waxed polyester thread. This unique design has space for up to 8 cards (including your ID card) and a simple yet effective way to store your money.
Limited Edition Wallets; Just to make this even more unique we're offering a one-off Limited Edition version, with one of a kind multicoloured waxed thread and personal message option of your choice. We'll contact you once you order to find out what you would like to include in your message.

The future of our wallets;
We want to take these wallets further with new designs and features. Our next direct move is to create a beautiful woman's clutch purse with multiple card and money features, using a variety of coloured leathers to suit your preferences.

As with our limited edition wallets and journals we also hope to introduce personal stamp messaging so you can include your own personalised messages on your belt, in any length and font style. 



Our Journals;





Our Journals have a story of their own. As a perpetual traveller and seafarer I always enjoyed keeping a written journal to record my experiences so that one day my grand children or even great grand children could read through my book and find out who I really was and what I did. This was something I wished I could discover from my past family generations. I figured that by making myself a life lasting journal maybe one day future generations would find my journal and discover who I was. I don't think there's any better way to provide this kind of information other than through a hand written, beautiful leather bound journal.  
The journals are made with top grain, vegetable tanned genuine cows leather, are hand-punched and stitched with waxed polyester thread. Like all of our products your journal will wear and mould beautifully over time and securely store all of your writings, sketches and memories for decades to come.
Each journal comes with a simple natural wooden pencil, inserted into the  holder so you'll never need to search for something to write with. 
Not only this but we were able to source fully recycled paper from a local factory that is able to provide us with naturally processed recycled paper with a beautiful textured writing surface, to give your journal even more character in the most environmentally conscious way possible.
Limited Edition Journal; We are also offering a Limited Edition version with multi-coloured waxed thread and personal message option.
As with the wallet we'll contact you to discuss exactly what you would like to have personally written inside to complete your order of the most unique journal created just for you. 
The future of our Journals;
We realise that there is a need for journals in varying sizes and colours so as OHSOKO develops then so will our Journal designs. We hope to create a range of leather bound journals in varying thickness's with a choice of coloured recycled papers and leather colours. It really is endless what we can create and we're so excited to start the new designs process.

Lifetime Guarantee for all our products
OHSOKO prides itself on providing all of our customers with lifetime guarantee's for each product you purchase from us. This way you know that your product really is going to last you your lifetime. 
If you ever have an issue we'll pay for you to send your item back to us, we'll fix it, recondition it and send back to you looking like new again. 

What happens if we don't reach our goal?




As with many situations in life we always believe in having a plan B, so if we don't reach our goal we still know which direction to move in. 

Its actually very simple because we'll still be producing all the orders that we receive. If we get 100 orders, we'll produce those 100 pieces and use the funds to improve our production processes however we can with what we have available. It might just take a little longer and more hard work (something we are certainly not scared of) to get to our fully fledged small-business status.
So with that in mind we want to assure all of you amazing contributors that your orders are safe and everything that is pledged by you will be fulfilled by us with all the perks and features we have described above. 




What's the impact of OHSOKO for the world and for you?


Its a pretty big question but one which is so relevant to our ethics as a company. We feel so strongly about our impact and the way we want to run our business that it is at the forefront of both our creative and business minds. 

OHSOKO started as a simple way for me to say goodbye to the poor quality, highly priced products that are found in mainstream outlets and brands. Mass production might mean that there's a variety of incredible products to choose from out there but more often than not you have to compromise the quality for these items. 
OHSOKO offers lifetime guarantees on all of our products because we strongly believe in making something once, with such genuine quality that there is no need to waste material and time to have to replace an item so soon into its life. That's why we use traditional seafaring techniques because those techniques were developed so that marine leather items could withstand the worse that mother nature could throw at it.
We also pride ourselves in keeping this age-old, often forgotten skill alive, so we hope in our small way we can help retain a small piece of history in each of our products.
The impact for you is that you gain the peace of mind knowing we are here to look after you for life, that you will receive only the highest personal customer service available and that by purchasing our products you are contributing and helping to us to uphold only the best ethics for both our customers and our products alike. An of course, you also get your beautiful, one of a kind, products for life! 




    Nothing is without risks & challenges
This is something I learnt as a seafarer only too well and the same applies throughout life no matter what you are doing. That includes the challenges and risks we face with OHSOKO. 
there's no point in hiding the fact that it has been extremely difficult to get to this point. There have been so many hurdles and relentless challenges to overcome and master before we could ever think of launching a crowd funding campaign. 
Producing and manufacturing in Bali alone has its own set of unique challenges with language barriers and difficult logistics to manage in what is still a developing country. Sometimes things happen at a slightly slower pace than in the western world and there's very little you can do about it other than be patient.
Sourcing the best materials can also be very difficult because Bali, as a relatively small island, simply doesn't stock everything we need so we sometimes have to look elsewhere to obtain our materials. 
However, once our systems are in place and our suppliers are set we can begin to form structured relationships and find the best, most efficient ways to get what we need. Careful logistics management is paramount for a larger production demand and as we move into this stage we will fine tune all of our processes and logistics until we have the company running like a perfectly oiled wheel. 

When can you expect to get your products?
Whilst we get this off the ground and start to get that wheel turning we hope you will understand that timing can often be slower to start with. That being said we plan to move into full production on 16th February 2016 once our campaign is completed, with the first of our orders being created and shipped from April 1st 2016. By this time we believe that the wheel will be turning smoothly and OHSOKO will be fully fledged!

    Other Ways You Can Help

However, if you like what you see and want to help indirectly then the best way to do it would be to share us on social media or elsewhere. You could simply tell your next door neighbour or friend about what we're trying to do... perhaps they can help and would be interested too?

<h3>                                          </h3>
<h3>Hello my name is Beverly Smith. I created a unique fashion accessory line. The all in one headwrap. I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur. When the concept came to me for the all in one headwrap, I was actually sitting down wearing a large scarf made into a headwrap with the knot in the back. When I pulled it off and held it in my hand, I thought to myself how cool would it be if you can buy something like this in the stores. Then I thought how cool would it be if I create it myself. I knew it was time to put some action to my ideas. The vision of the all in one headwrap was so clear to me. I start writing down my ideas and sketching that day. I knew what I wanted it to look like. I came up with several concepts but I couldn't stop thinking about this one. I was so excited. After sketching without any sewing background I bought a sewing machine, worked on the headwrap for a while, but the headwrap needed a finishing touch. My next step was to look into sourcing for a prototype to be made. After researching on my own on how to bring an idea to the market, I learned about logos, tag lines, patents and prototypes. I also designed my own logo and made my first prototype. Later on I was introduced to a great production company who help me make a polished and markable product. I am very passionate about my product and having a great learning experience. Although I know there is a lot more to learn. Knot a Hat Knot a Scarf is always on my mind. I created a vision board of inspiring head wraps, I'm constantly thinking of what can I do to make people love my product. It's amazing how many ideas I came up with for the all in one head wrap. Just the thought of the concept to the market and sharing it with the world makes me work harder and committed to making it happen. It's such an amazing feeling when people can see my vision. The feed back makes my heart smile. With this working prototype, I would love for you to go on this amazing journey with me. Bringing Knot a Hat Knot a Scarf to reality.</h3>

</div></div>","Hello my name is Beverly Smith. I created a unique fashion accessory line. The all in one headwrap. I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur. When the concept came to me for the all in one headwrap, I was actually sitting down wearing a large scarf made into a headwrap with the knot in the back. When I pulled it off and held it in my hand, I thought to myself how cool would it be if you can buy something like this in the stores. Then I thought how cool would it be if I create it myself. I knew it was time to put some action to my ideas. The vision of the all in one headwrap was so clear to me. I start writing down my ideas and sketching that day. I knew what I wanted it to look like. I came up with several concepts but I couldn't stop thinking about this one. I was so excited. After sketching without any sewing background I bought a sewing machine, worked on the headwrap for a while, but the headwrap needed a finishing touch. My next step was to look into sourcing for a prototype to be made. After researching on my own on how to bring an idea to the market, I learned about logos, tag lines, patents and prototypes. I also designed my own logo and made my first prototype. Later on I was introduced to a great production company who help me make a polished and markable product. I am very passionate about my product and having a great learning experience. Although I know there is a lot more to learn. Knot a Hat Knot a Scarf is always on my mind. I created a vision board of inspiring head wraps, I'm constantly thinking of what can I do to make people love my product. It's amazing how many ideas I came up with for the all in one head wrap. Just the thought of the concept to the market and sharing it with the world makes me work harder and committed to making it happen. It's such an amazing feeling when people can see my vision. The feed back makes my heart smile. With this working prototype, I would love for you to go on this amazing journey with me. Bringing Knot a Hat Knot a Scarf to reality.

<p>The Journés  are hand made in Florence from triplets in a family operated business. Each bracelet must travel through 5 stations before  it becomes a finished product. We wanted a unique bangle for both him and her. Six months and 7 samples later, we finally had Journé. Inside the bracelet is an inscription inscribed stating ""your journé makes a difference"". They cost 129€ (including the 19% tax ) and 10% of the revenue is donated to the selected organization.</p>

<h3>PRODUCT ROADMAP</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We introduced the bracelets at the end of the quarter of last 2016. After receiving positive feedback we would now like to promote the products. Also, we just finished the sample more affordable Journé bracelets. With your help we would be able to produce the bracelets which would expand our market and increase awareness. Quarter 3 of 2017 we would like to add 2 more colors and causes. In 2018 we would like to add more products and eventually make Journé a global brand for charity products.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The only risk that we currently foresee would be if the family operated production site closes down and we can not produce the bracelets. If that should come to play we will find other resources as to not allow it to affect the production of the Journé bracelets. There might be a delay in the production of the bracelets but that is always a potential risk. Currently, we are not experiencing this problem. The team could fall out but we made it through puberty so I dont see that as being a risk either.</p>
<p>We have spoken with a number of editors, magazines, medical institutions who are all very interested in our story and what we are trying to achieve. The downside has always been our budget (or lack of one). To receive a featured article with advertisement is expensive and we just could not afford it. So with your help i think we can overcome this challenge and could receive the needed awareness for this project.</p>
<p>Ultimately our goal is to make Journé a global brand for charity products.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","BRACELETS THAT DO GOOD
The name Journé is derived from the"" journey"" we are all on. Please join Alexa & I along our journey with our Journé awareness bracelets in trying to make a difference-
Each color represents a cause along with a supporting charity.
With your new Journé bangle you can share and show the cause that you have chosen to support. The more people wearing the Journés; the more we can support the causes. The time is now and together we can make a difference.
Perhaps you are a survivor; know someone in the healing process, or you have suffered the loss of someone dear to you. Maybe you want to make the world more environmentally friendly, make a statement against violence, help children in need or you want to support our four-legged friends. With your Journé bracelet you can bring awareness to the cause that you would like to support, or wear the bangle to honor someone special. 
The Journé bracelets are suitable for every occasion and make a great statement accessory while doing good.
Join us on our Journé in making a difference!

 
 

 

 

 

Here are just a few that have joined our new trend and campaign ""THUMBS UP- To making a Difference"" !


Each color has one or two causes. We currently have 8 colors representing 12 causes and with your help we can produce more colors and add more causes to choose from.
 

 

 

Charlie is our mascot and supports animal abuse and animal shelters. 
 
EXAMPLES OF SOME OF OUR CAUSES:
 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 
THE PRODUCT

The Journés  are hand made in Florence from triplets in a family operated business. Each bracelet must travel through 5 stations before  it becomes a finished product. We wanted a unique bangle for both him and her. Six months and 7 samples later, we finally had Journé. Inside the bracelet is an inscription inscribed stating ""your journé makes a difference"". They cost 129€ (including the 19% tax ) and 10% of the revenue is donated to the selected organization.

 




 

This is an example of a workshop we support. The Organization is called DKMS LIFE- look good feel better which does amazing work world-wide providing seminars for cancer patients to boost their self esteem during this trying time period. 


 
PRODUCT ROADMAP
 
We introduced the bracelets at the end of the quarter of last 2016. After receiving positive feedback we would now like to promote the products. Also, we just finished the sample more affordable Journé bracelets. With your help we would be able to produce the bracelets which would expand our market and increase awareness. Quarter 3 of 2017 we would like to add 2 more colors and causes. In 2018 we would like to add more products and eventually make Journé a global brand for charity products.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a collective of designers creating comedically controversial and politically charged merch that expresses our deep, and real, frustrations with the Trump administration. Our mission is to work with organizations whose important work counters the disastrous effects of 45’s “ideas” all while helping other’s publicly express their own dissatisfaction with the current White House occupant. The lowly t-shirt and poster have been used as an outward expression of our identity for decades. Whether it's your favorite band’s tour tee or a kitten reminding you to hang in there, our clothes say something about ourselves.</p>
<p>As designers, our days consist of developing brands, building websites, and designing some of the products you might already own. When well executed, our work can strike up a conversation with folks on the street or your Trump lovin’ Uncle at your next family gathering. He’s gonna love these items and we hope you do too. You’ll have so much to chat about.</p>
<p>All of the items sold through our online store will donate to organizations whose work help those affected by the policies that have been put into place since the Trump Administration has taken office.</p>
<p>While we await Trump’s inevitable exit from office, we will continue to produce new designs throughout the upcoming months, adding new designers to our roster of collaborators. Looking to work with us? Drop us a line.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducing Nuorikko</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507138124/mwe5deny3xrj5j7olayi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><a href=""http://nuorikko.com/lookbook/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See the Spring 2018 Collection</a></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Bridal Landscape</h2>
<p>Last year, there were 2.2 million weddings in the U.S. which is an average of <strong><i>over 6000 weddings every day</i></strong>! The bridal industry is a growing market, but, like other traditional retailers, many bridal gown manufacturers are struggling or even going out of business. The modern bride is more interested in individuality than tradition, and there is too much importance assigned to a wedding gown for her to compromise on an experience or a product she doesn’t feel is right for her.<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Nuorikko is empowering the millennial bride.</i></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>We are bringing some of the best elements of the custom design process to the mass market, creating an experience that is simpler, faster, less expensive, and more personal.</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Not every bride has the option of going custom, or the vision to create a gown from scratch. Most brides simply want better options for a style they feel beautiful and comfortable in. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Benefit to the Bride</h2>
<p>Nuorikko is the first brand in the bridal market to combine a unique, customizable product, technology-focused manufacturing, and interactive sales tools.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>We deliver a customized product in less than half the time it takes our competitors to deliver a standard gown.</i></h3>
<p> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Evolution of the Bridal Gown</h2>
<p>Nuorikko’s unique product is not a custom gown, neither is it a traditional made-to-order bridal gown. Its better than either of these models. Our line of mix &amp; match separates, with customizations on every piece, gives you the ability to choose your silhouette, style, and options such as neckline, sleeve, train, and fabric. With only 15 pieces, there are <strong><i>more than 8000 potential combinations</i></strong>.</p>
<p>Nuorikko does not use traditional made-to-order manufacturing. The line features bespoke, premium materials and trims, and our standard, variable option system creates a gown that is unique and quick to produce, otherwise known as <strong><i>mass customization</i></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>All of our products are exclusively manufactured in the U.S.</i></h3>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>Our line of mix &amp; match separates is designed to be far more than just tops + bottoms. Its a unique mix of silhouettes, fabrics, and options that can be styled together in just about any combination a Nuorikko bride can imagine.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Each piece has its own specific set of standard variations, giving even more flexibility and individuality to the finished look. Depending on the piece, you can choose to add or remove a train, sleeves, or embellishments, or change a neckline or hem length to suit your body and your style.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the Founder</h2>
<p>My name is Kaitlyn, and I am not only the CEO &amp; Founder of Nuorikko, I am a former frustrated bride. 10 years ago, I made my own wedding gown because I couldn’t find any options on the market that even came close to suiting my personal style. Then, as my 10th anniversary and vow renewal approached, I found myself even more frustrated with the lack of options on the market that allowed for individuality, or for that matter, a positive shopping experience. I decided it was past time someone set to work <strong><i>updating the stagnant niche that is the bridal gown market</i></strong>, and Nuorikko’s concept was born.</p>

The Bridal Landscape
Last year, there were 2.2 million weddings in the U.S. which is an average of over 6000 weddings every day! The bridal industry is a growing market, but, like other traditional retailers, many bridal gown manufacturers are struggling or even going out of business. The modern bride is more interested in individuality than tradition, and there is too much importance assigned to a wedding gown for her to compromise on an experience or a product she doesn’t feel is right for her. 
Nuorikko is empowering the millennial bride.
We are bringing some of the best elements of the custom design process to the mass market, creating an experience that is simpler, faster, less expensive, and more personal.
 
Not every bride has the option of going custom, or the vision to create a gown from scratch. Most brides simply want better options for a style they feel beautiful and comfortable in. 
 
The Benefit to the Bride
Nuorikko is the first brand in the bridal market to combine a unique, customizable product, technology-focused manufacturing, and interactive sales tools.
 
We deliver a customized product in less than half the time it takes our competitors to deliver a standard gown.
 
Its the bridal gown, evolved. The millennial bride is a savvy and discerning customer, and she wants this type of hands-on shopping experience.
 

Customizable Separates + Powerful Technologies = Empowered Brides
 
The Evolution of the Bridal Gown
Nuorikko’s unique product is not a custom gown, neither is it a traditional made-to-order bridal gown. Its better than either of these models. Our line of mix & match separates, with customizations on every piece, gives you the ability to choose your silhouette, style, and options such as neckline, sleeve, train, and fabric. With only 15 pieces, there are more than 8000 potential combinations.
Nuorikko does not use traditional made-to-order manufacturing. The line features bespoke, premium materials and trims, and our standard, variable option system creates a gown that is unique and quick to produce, otherwise known as mass customization.
 
All of our products are exclusively manufactured in the U.S.

<div><p></p></div>
</div><p>According to
the U.S. Department of Justice September 2013 Special Report, “Police Behavior
during Traffic and Street Stops, 2011,” in 2011, over 62.9 million U.S.
residents age 16 or older, or 26% of the population, had one or more contacts
with police during the prior 12 months. For about half (49%) of persons
experiencing contact with police, the most recent contact was involuntary or police-initiated.
1 in 10 believed the police had not behaved properly. Regardless of the reason
for the stop, less than 5% of persons who believed the police had not behaved
properly filed a complaint.</p>
<p>In a world of
increasing potential dangers, Global Justice seeks to increase personal
security for the everyday drive to work, the grocery store, and the road trip.
The Company also seeks to protect ordinary citizens from the public safety
issues that arise during common traffic stops. Global Justice was birthed to
help increase both public and officer safety by documenting traffic stops as
thoroughly as possible. The goal is to minimize potential dangers by improving
human behavior (both officer and vehicle occupants) and preventing situation
escalation. Well-documented scientific research has found that human behavior
is improved when people realize that they are being observed or are otherwise
under surveillance. Global Justice will utilize this knowledge combined with
the latest technological advancements to design products that promote peaceful
encounters between law enforcement and civilians while protecting customers
from other potentially dangerous situations, including theft and
kidnapping. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

According to
the U.S. Department of Justice September 2013 Special Report, “Police Behavior
during Traffic and Street Stops, 2011,” in 2011, over 62.9 million U.S.
residents age 16 or older, or 26% of the population, had one or more contacts
with police during the prior 12 months. For about half (49%) of persons
experiencing contact with police, the most recent contact was involuntary or police-initiated.
1 in 10 believed the police had not behaved properly. Regardless of the reason
for the stop, less than 5% of persons who believed the police had not behaved
properly filed a complaint.
In a world of
increasing potential dangers, Global Justice seeks to increase personal
security for the everyday drive to work, the grocery store, and the road trip.
The Company also seeks to protect ordinary citizens from the public safety
issues that arise during common traffic stops. Global Justice was birthed to
help increase both public and officer safety by documenting traffic stops as
thoroughly as possible. The goal is to minimize potential dangers by improving
human behavior (both officer and vehicle occupants) and preventing situation
escalation. Well-documented scientific research has found that human behavior
is improved when people realize that they are being observed or are otherwise
under surveillance. Global Justice will utilize this knowledge combined with
the latest technological advancements to design products that promote peaceful
encounters between law enforcement and civilians while protecting customers
from other potentially dangerous situations, including theft and
kidnapping.

Risks & Challenges
The risks with Global Justice will be ensuring we don't overstep our boundaries. Once we hire our Chief Legal Officer and legal team, we will ensure the laws of our land are not ignored.  This includes Global Justice staff as well as police officers and our clients, we believe no one is above the law. 

Just as we witness police ""abuse of power"" we also witness bad elements of society fatally injure our good and innocent police officers during traffic stops. We cannot prevent every bad outcome but we will assess and reassess what is working, and what is not working and implement the proper necessary changes.
What we mean by that is, we plan to employ psychologists to study events and help bring a safe answer to implementing new, and future policies. We will make our studies available to the Department of Justice so that police departments throughout the country can have evidence-based data. Right now, much of their data regarding police abuse and traffic stops are collected via surveys. This is a subjective-type data collection. With our clear video footage we will provide clear objective data.
As a military veteran, electrician, Navy Corpsman, Lab tech and Nurse, Tom's practice has always included assessing and reassessing. These same traits have been long instilled within his daughter Samantha. This same practice of assessing and reassessing to stay ahead of the curve will be implemented throughout Global Justice to ensure we stay sharp while we forge through these exciting times of Securing Your Liberties.

Tracking lines

Recognizing Faces
Detecting Color and Shapes

Tracking Balls

Following People




For parents, Mu is the head of a robot that your kids can design and put together.
For Lego EV3 users, Mu is the missing vision sensor that Lego NEVER releases.
For hobbyists, Mu is the smart eye and brain that can be embedded in any robotic projects.

Priced at almost half of an original Lego EV3 sensor, Mu delivers great technology in a very affordable package.




Mu was launched in CES 2016!

During CES, the Mu LIVE demo attracted thousands of visitors each day from both media and industry. The Morpx team also presented a Mu live demo at the New York Toy Fair in Feb 2016.


“Mu smart toy, a sensor add-on that acts as a smart eye and brain for your existing remote controlled toys” -- CES 2016 official Press Release
“How does the Internet of Things see? Through modules like the Mu.” -- PCWorld“Morpx's Mu for Toys gives your favorite toys the gift of sight”  -- IDG.TV
“…smartest, most innovative projects that caught our attention” — Atmel Blog
Mu has been featured in:




Benefits and Features







How to play with Mu?
There are different ways to pair Mu with a toy body (most of which can be sourced easily online or in your local stores).
1. Mu action figures （for 5+)

You can create bodies for Mu using lego pieces or wood blocks. Mu makes a great action figure that can see and talk. You can even record your own voice. We will publish building instructions of different action figures when Mu ships.

2. Mu autonomous toy robots (for 7+)

You can install Mu on remote controlled toys such as the Hexbug remote controlled series (Spider, Tarantula, or Fire ant). Mu's Infra-Red transmitter can talk to any IR controlled toy to move them around as an autonomous robot.

3. Mu on Lego Mindstorms EV3 (for 9+)

You can build more advanced robots using Lego Mindstorms EV3. Mu can talk to EV3 through its IR sensor. Just set the EV3 to the IR control mode and Mu will take over the control.
4. Mu with its own body (New!)


We have designed a customized body based on the open source robot zowi (with 4 servo motors on the legs for many dance moves). Check our newly added perk!

Once Mu is installed on a robotic body, it can perform a number of detection & tracking tasks as shown previously. You will use the mode button on the back of Mu to switch between these tasks. Have more awesome ideas of using Mu? Share with us at mu@morpx.com. You could be chosen to win a free Mu developer's package.
Select your perk
Our mission is to make robot building a fun experience for everyone. Your contribution is very important for us to reach that goal. As a reward, you will be among the first to experience the cutting edge technology embedded in Mu. Grab that early bird price before it's gone!






Toys that are compatible with Mu


Mu is compatible with any toy that uses infra-red remote control. Mu can control a toy as long as the IR codes of the toy are known.
Here is a list of well-known IR controlled toys (where earlier items are easier to integrate with Mu). And we are working hard to add new toys to the list.

  1. Lego Mindstorms EV3:  LEGO, Amazon
  2. Hexbug Remote Controlled bugs: Spider, Tarantula, Fire ant
  3. Lego Technic Sets with Power Functions and IR receiver: LEGO, Amazon
  4.  Remote controlled Robot by ThinkGizmos: Amazon
  5.  Zoomer Dino: Amazon
  6. Disney Cars Lightning McQueen: Amazon
  7. Other IR toys: Amazon



What's inside a Mu package?

1. Fully assembled Mu. (For those who choose the no battery early bird version, your Mu has to draw power from the USB or other sources. LEGO Mindstorms EV3 has a USB port that you could use for power.)
2. Universal mount for Mu.
3. Double-sided foam stickers.
4. Micro-USB cable for charging and data transfer.
5. Cardboard for creating a stationary body for Mu.
6. Instruction manual.

Who We Are


Morpx, the company behind Mu, is a technology & design startup born in Silicon Valley and grown up in Hangzhou, China. Our mission is to give vision, arguably the most important human sense, to any ordinary object through hardware and software innovations. 
Morpx was founded in July 2013 by former Google researcher Dr. Tianli Yu and Dr. Frank Ran. Both founders are parents of school-aged kids and they know first hand the importance of kids playing in the real world rather than on the smartphone.



Technical Details

Inside a MU

Small, versatile, yet easy to use, Mu is an engineering marvel that delivers state-of-the-art computer vision hardware and software in a tiny, self-contained package.
It has:

A camera to see colors, lines, balls, faces, and human contours.
A universal IR transmitter to control LEGO EV3, Hexbugs, etc.
An internal speaker for voice and music.
A set of color LEDs as blinking eyes.
An internal rechargeable battery that runs continuously for up to 8 hours.





Mu has already gone through 4 iterations of PCB design.

For DIYers
The Mu PCB includes two sets of the 3-wire servo connectors. It also has SPI/I2C pins to interface with Arduino or Raspberry Pi. We will release a community version of the Mu software for people who like to write their own control program.



Hardware specs




The Software
M-Eye OS, the software platform running on Mu, is specifically optimized for interactive robots that rely primarily on visual sensors. It has a very compact memory footprint and can even run entirely in the cache of modern processors. 
M-Eye OS can boot up in 1 second, while other Linux based solutions take 30 - 60 seconds to boot.


On top of the M-Eye OS is our cutting-edge computer vision library that includes algorithms such as:

Line / shape / color tracking
Face detection / recognition
Human body tracking
Morpx Deep Learning Runtime Engine

The Mu4Toys App

You can use the Mu4Toys app to customize the Mu's behavior on different toys, set event triggering or record voice response. Once it is customized, you don't need smartphone again to play with your Mu robot.

Our mission is to make finding missing assets easy, fast & painless. While at the same time changing the fate of the ones that go lost or stolen.
Tracker Now is the smallest GPS tracking device that acts as a bridge between technology and personal items. Always know belongings are secure, loved ones are safe, and pets are where they should be!
The Tracker Now device is the first its kind to apply BLE, GPS, GSM, and Wifi. Leveraging all of these technologies Ensures Worldwide Tracking  Putting the control of finding lost items at your fingertips no matter where they may be at anytime 



Through the use of BLE, GPS, GSM, and Wifi for Global Worldwide Tracking, Tracker Now is just a ping a from making sure nothing gets lost again. 



This function is especially useful for children or pets. Example: A user can set parameters by drawing a fence around his or her property. If tracked child or pet leaves the house or yard user is notified. Fences can be drawn anywhere worldwide.



 The embedded speaker makes it easier to find a tracked item.  The chirping will lead you directly to it.

Always know where your belongings are while vacationing or working away from home. 
*Language barrier? speaking or reading? No problem, you will precisely know where a tracked item is if it goes missing, even in unfamiliar surroundings.
*On the other hand while leaving your world behind it is beneficial to be able to receive notifications if important possessions aren't where they are supposed to be. Or if you just want to check in on them.
Are you a business?  Tracker Now supports business needs for both small and large size companies. Tracker Now was built off the experience of losing very important personal and business documents, so we understand the urgency of real time tracking and asset awareness. That is why we we want to team up with large and small businesses to cater to demands, deadlines and asset tracking.  Keeping everyone at ease with reliable safe and secure service. 


                                                                                                          Where is your item?

What Makes Tracker Now Different?
The current consumer tracking devices on the market use a BLE (Bluetooth low energy) module that doesn't cover more than 150 feet. Therefore, in case of theft, your items would be lost forever. However, with the implementation of an advanced GPS and BLE module, Tracker Now gives you the ability to track your belongings across the entire globe assuring you never lose anything again. Why nothing compares to Tracker Now.(logos above each) Coming .....

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a small and broke trans guy, I've always had a hard time finding the right clothes. Either something is too big, or it shows what I want to hide, or it's too expensive, or it's in the women's section. I've had an even harder time finding women's shoes for my friend (whom I won't name), because while I can just go to the kids' section or find the most masculine shoes in the women's, their feet are, well... huge. Men's shoes don't carry the styles they want, and women's don't carry the sizes (and if they do, they're $300). And I realized that there's no way we're the only ones. So I came up with some designs, from curve-creating dresses to curve-hiding pants to training heels that aren't just made in kids' sizes, to help other trans people, and all people with different body shapes than accepted by most fashion designers, find clothes they like that fit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not many teenagers or young adults have the tools to make size 15 shoes at home--or any shoes, for that matter. In order to start this business, I need tools, supplies, and employees. I can probably make most of the prototypes myself, but I'll need help with a lot of things. Most people I know who are willing to help me aren't expecting 6-figure salaries, but I still need to pay them--if not for them or the law, for my own conscience. Materials are also expensive: I need cloth for most of my designs, swimsuit material, rubber, leather-like fabric, etc. That's where most of this money comes in. And even once I've made the products, I'll need some money for advertising in order to let the people who need my products know that they're out there. That's where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>Goals and future perks</strong></p>
<p>Not all of my perks are decided or outlined yet, but here's an idea of perks that will be available once the campaign reaches certain amounts. I will launch the store no matter how much is made at this point because I have enough for a few materials, but the selection will be extremely limited unless I hit these goals. If you want to get these perks, or if you want to be able to buy these more difficult items from the store, please share and help me reach my goals!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515919297/yw6iadejo229u21qr2yu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many people, including some reading this, have been to the store and tried to find something that fit them, only to find that the proportions are all wrong, or that the only thing that fits them is an ugly pair of grey slacks with a weird pattern... All of us would benefit from the start of this company. Even those with ""normal"" body types could probably find something here, because the point of the project is diversity. Every height, weight, and body type will have something for them here, with every level of masculinity or femininity. This will be help to trans people everywhere, sure, but it'll also help you. I hope to make products affordable and still have good value, even if it means making some sacrifices profit-wise.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main thing is that it may be hard to find customers. I need to be able to make products inexpensive without them being cheap, and I'll need to get the word out. Fortunately, having grown up without much money, I know how to spot good deals. I won't just pick out the best fabric, but I won't just pick out the cheapest either. I've trained myself to weigh the price, the quality, and the quantity deliberately and carefully. So the fabric I buy may not be angora delicately combed from a rabbit that only eats gold, but it won't be polyester woven by 10-year-olds, either. And it may be hard to find people who are dissatisfied with the proportions of the average clothing line, but I do have an online presence within the trans community, and I know some people, from clinics to churches, who may be willing to help me tell people. I'm also (hopefully and probably) going to start college in the fall in a diverse setting where there will be more people like me. I think that my friends and family and I, with your help, can make this work. If you know people who could use this fashion line or just like fashion, please tell them about this. Even if they can't contribute to the campaign, they'll know about the store when it's up and they'll be able to shop and tell their other friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you, like a lot of people who need this fashion line in the first place, have no money to contribute or have more important things to spend it on, I understand. However, that definitely doesn't mean you can't help! Share this campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or wherever people will see it. If you have trans friends, or know people who want to try finding clothes that are produced for them rather than just for money (I'm talking pockets, girls!), let them know that I'm here. Something like this takes a community--or just one person with a bunch of money, but I don't have enough for this and I'm sure you don't either (And if you do, don't spend it all here. Help out other projects. Buy your friends some gifts. Perhaps from my store once it's running ;)). With all of us working together, though, this could become the next big thing.</p>
<h3><strong>Referral Contest!</strong></h3>
<p>For the rest of the campaign, you can win prizes from the store without paying anything!

</div></div>","Short Summary
As a small and broke trans guy, I've always had a hard time finding the right clothes. Either something is too big, or it shows what I want to hide, or it's too expensive, or it's in the women's section. I've had an even harder time finding women's shoes for my friend (whom I won't name), because while I can just go to the kids' section or find the most masculine shoes in the women's, their feet are, well... huge. Men's shoes don't carry the styles they want, and women's don't carry the sizes (and if they do, they're $300). And I realized that there's no way we're the only ones. So I came up with some designs, from curve-creating dresses to curve-hiding pants to training heels that aren't just made in kids' sizes, to help other trans people, and all people with different body shapes than accepted by most fashion designers, find clothes they like that fit.

What We Need & What You Get
Unfortunately, not many teenagers or young adults have the tools to make size 15 shoes at home--or any shoes, for that matter. In order to start this business, I need tools, supplies, and employees. I can probably make most of the prototypes myself, but I'll need help with a lot of things. Most people I know who are willing to help me aren't expecting 6-figure salaries, but I still need to pay them--if not for them or the law, for my own conscience. Materials are also expensive: I need cloth for most of my designs, swimsuit material, rubber, leather-like fabric, etc. That's where most of this money comes in. And even once I've made the products, I'll need some money for advertising in order to let the people who need my products know that they're out there. That's where you come in.
Goals and future perks
Not all of my perks are decided or outlined yet, but here's an idea of perks that will be available once the campaign reaches certain amounts. I will launch the store no matter how much is made at this point because I have enough for a few materials, but the selection will be extremely limited unless I hit these goals. If you want to get these perks, or if you want to be able to buy these more difficult items from the store, please share and help me reach my goals!


The Impact
Many people, including some reading this, have been to the store and tried to find something that fit them, only to find that the proportions are all wrong, or that the only thing that fits them is an ugly pair of grey slacks with a weird pattern... All of us would benefit from the start of this company. Even those with ""normal"" body types could probably find something here, because the point of the project is diversity. Every height, weight, and body type will have something for them here, with every level of masculinity or femininity. This will be help to trans people everywhere, sure, but it'll also help you. I hope to make products affordable and still have good value, even if it means making some sacrifices profit-wise.

Risks & Challenges
The main thing is that it may be hard to find customers. I need to be able to make products inexpensive without them being cheap, and I'll need to get the word out. Fortunately, having grown up without much money, I know how to spot good deals. I won't just pick out the best fabric, but I won't just pick out the cheapest either. I've trained myself to weigh the price, the quality, and the quantity deliberately and carefully. So the fabric I buy may not be angora delicately combed from a rabbit that only eats gold, but it won't be polyester woven by 10-year-olds, either. And it may be hard to find people who are dissatisfied with the proportions of the average clothing line, but I do have an online presence within the trans community, and I know some people, from clinics to churches, who may be willing to help me tell people. I'm also (hopefully and probably) going to start college in the fall in a diverse setting where there will be more people like me. I think that my friends and family and I, with your help, can make this work. If you know people who could use this fashion line or just like fashion, please tell them about this. Even if they can't contribute to the campaign, they'll know about the store when it's up and they'll be able to shop and tell their other friends.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you, like a lot of people who need this fashion line in the first place, have no money to contribute or have more important things to spend it on, I understand. However, that definitely doesn't mean you can't help! Share this campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or wherever people will see it. If you have trans friends, or know people who want to try finding clothes that are produced for them rather than just for money (I'm talking pockets, girls!), let them know that I'm here. Something like this takes a community--or just one person with a bunch of money, but I don't have enough for this and I'm sure you don't either (And if you do, don't spend it all here. Help out other projects. Buy your friends some gifts. Perhaps from my store once it's running ;)). With all of us working together, though, this could become the next big thing.
Referral Contest!
For the rest of the campaign, you can win prizes from the store without paying anything! If you log into your Indiegogo account and share your referral link, I can see how much was raised through it. If you don't have an account, copy this link: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/transcending... add ""name-"" and your name, ""tumblr-"" and your Tumblr, or ""ig-"" and your Instragram onto the end!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What is RYGSÄK?</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>RYGSÄK was created to help you express yourself through your backpack. Over the past three years, we've worked to develop and design a bag that would be functional, stylish, and high-quality. </p>
<p>This Backpack allows you to interchange various aspects for different colors, styles, and materials. If you add our Denim pocket/straps to your order, you'll have 90 different ways to wear your backpack!</p>
<p>Our Origins Bag is just that; a starting point. We've designed this bag with the end in mind, and have HUGE plans for RYGSÄK. There are an unlimited amount of ways we can make this bag fit YOUR style. With the success of this campaign, we're hoping to release more designs on Pocket &amp; Strap Bundles starting next year. Endless patterns, and material combinations are coming your way! This is your chance to be on the front-line of something huge. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You change your clothes every day, why not change your backpack?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Since conception, we've known that quality was something we couldn't budge on. We refuse to put our names on a product that doesn't meet our high standards. Every single part of this backpack is intentional, and has been built it from the ground up. We have been hyper-focused on the details. Yes, we love the functionality of the bag, but we wanted to go deeper than surface level. There are a number of features that you won't notice right off the bat, or maybe ever, that will make you FEEL the quality we've built in. Everything from the stitch counts, tapered design, and seat-belt webbing are direct evidence of how obsessed we are with details.</p>

<p>Traditional backpacks are used for 3-5 years, and don't allow you to keep up with changing style trends. They're completely basic in regards to storage, and lack the functionality that users are looking for. RYGSÄK lets you change your straps, and outer pocket for newer colors, patterns, and materials. We've leaned towards a timeless, classic design to make our bag the one you'll want to wear long-term.  We've designed a simple, yet effective set of organizational pockets that allows you to use them across a variety of situations. We're confident that this bag will keep you organized. Regardless of your circumstances, you'll want to use it every day.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Materials</h2>
<p>With quality as our top priority, we've sourced durable materials, and have built this bag to last for years to come. We initially wanted to build the backpack out of Cotton Duck Canvas, since it's commonly used in military-grade bags. We quickly learned that Duck Canvas isn't as water resistant as we'd hoped, and wouldn't allow us to print patterns onto it. We knew we couldn't settle for a cheap polyester, so we started the hunt for our perfect material. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main portion of the bag is made of a synthetic material called COTNA. This fabric has the same, quality feel as canvas; but has a higher tensile strength, and is water resistant. It's soft to the touch but durable. This fabric also allows us to use a printing method called Dye Sublimation, which means <strong><i>we can print limitless colors and patterns</i></strong> on the material, and they won't wear off!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575431282/h7te1o3lhfc5uaxkad1j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>COTNA (left), Leather (right)</i></p>
<p>With so much work having gone into finding our base material, we knew we couldn't cheap out on the bottom of the bag. We've been unbelievably picky about which leather we wanted to use. The leather on the prototype is genuine, but doesn't feel as authentic as we'd anticipated. We didn't want to use a top-grain leather that would scratch or scuff easily since it's being used on the part of your backpack that takes the heaviest beating.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We've Identified a unique leather for production that is not only genuine, but extremely durable and high-quality. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>While assessing the most common fail points of a backpack, we came to the zippers. We DESPISE poor-quality zippers. Nothing is more aggravating than jamming a zipper, or having it pull off. Because of this, we opted to use YKK zippers on the bag to save you some frustration. </p>

<h3>Why RevoOptics:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our company was founded by Nationally Certified Opticians who are truly passionate about optics. We have worked in labs and manufactured lenses, worked alongside independent Optometrists and big box chain retailers and always felt guilty about selling a medical device for a sometimes unattainable amount. <br/><br/>The day our Co-Founder and CEO saw a woman crying when one of his co-workers told that her that she had to spend $1,200 dollars on a pair of glasses, that it was a necessity for her prescription, which was a blatant lie, is the day the Revolution was born.<br/><br/>You see the thing that's wrong with the optical industry is most opticians, eyewear sales associates, etc. Work off of commission. Further more some Dr's actually own the optical! Imagine if your surgeon worked off of commision, or if your Family Physician owned the pharmacy. That's a scary thought! <br/><br/>That’s where we come in. Our goal is to revolutionize the eyecare industry by offering high quality prescription glasses for $125.00! That includes an anti glare coating, polycarbonate lenses, a lifetime frame warranty and up to a ten year lens warranty!</p>

We’ll also be investing in a sunglass line, and we’ll be opening our first ever brick and mortar store by July 2020, with plans to expand into every major city in the US by 2027.</li>
<li>We’ll be using $35,000 USD to expand our product offering including digital HD progressive lenses, 13 more unique frames, and a total of 36 sunglass frames that will be available in prescription and non prescription.</li>
<li>$60,000 USD will be used for our new store opening, which includes technology, lab equipment, and personnel.</li>

The watch, which was created because of the growing and cherished for years passion. The automatic and solid Miyota mechanism is designed with a brushed stainless steel 316L casing with a screw case back and crown.


The luminous logo and hands will help you in reading the watch.

The casing is covered with a aventurine face with 3D signs on it. Both side (crystal and caseback)is covered with the sapphire crystal glass. What is more, we added a waterproof  up to 200m/660 ft. 

From the one hand, this watch is perfect for official business meetings, a theatre or a philharmonic concerts. From the other hand, it is great for sport challenges like deep-sea diving or downhill race, just attach the appropriate strap to it.


This watch is the most important in our history, because is debut.  It was designed from the bottom up in Great Britain and also tested in the local mountains, woods and on the islands surrounded by the beautiful sea. 


 
SPECIFICATION


Our watch is an marvelous artwork.

At first I thought I was the one helping them grow, build confidence, and take down barriers, but in all reality, I was growing, building confidence, and breaking down my own barriers. There is something freeing when being around pure happiness, pure excitement, pure adrenaline, or even pure sadness or anger. These individuals have faced more challenges than most of us do in a lifetime and I believe these challenges taught them at an early age how precious life is. They show us the power of vulnerability and loving full heartedly. My point is this, I don’t want to develop this vision just to help individuals with exceptionalities, I want to help all generations experience the power of expression, acceptance, helping others, giving, loving, and being a positive impact! This cause is life changing for everyone involved and the goal is to grow that involvement from all aspects.

At GTFO we focus on the potential of an individual and then we help them understand and see that potential within themselves through new adventurous activities. We want to educate you on the growth that can come from outdoor adventures.</i></p><p><i>Findings suggest that outdoor education and wilderness programs can foster mental health in youths, young adults and spark a child like mentality in older generations. There have been hundreds of studies done to prove the growth that comes from new adventurous experiences.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>How do adventures help exactly?</strong></p><ul>
<li><i>They take place in an unfamiliar natural physical environment, which helps a person disconnect from the daily routine allowing them the mental space to dissect their self-concept and identity.</i></li>
<li><i>Adventures consist of challenging activities with authentic and clear consequences that usually involve cooperation with others. Successfully trying and/or succeeding challenging activities changes an individuals outlook and attitude towards what is possible within themselves.</i></li>
<li><i>Most adventures take place in a small-group social setting which allows individuals to increase social skills and connect with others.</i></li>
<li><i>This cause is successful because of the guides provided by ASC. These individuals are experienced, skilled instructors who ensure physical safety and emotional support during the program. This allows the individuals with exceptionalities to learn new skills, build trust within others, and changes their outlook when it comes to their competence.</i></li>

A WORD FROM OUR FOUNDER (Chase Pettey) I want to leave you with this thought. I (Chase Pettey the founder) have been beyond blessed to interact, coach, and befriend many individuals with mental and physical exceptionalities. At first I thought I was the one helping them grow, build confidence, and take down barriers, but in all reality, I was growing, building confidence, and breaking down my own barriers. There is something freeing when being around pure happiness, pure excitement, pure adrenaline, or even pure sadness or anger. These individuals have faced more challenges than most of us do in a lifetime and I believe these challenges taught them at an early age how precious life is. They show us the power of vulnerability and loving full heartedly. My point is this, I don’t want to develop this vision just to help individuals with exceptionalities, I want to help all generations experience the power of expression, acceptance, helping others, giving, loving, and being a positive impact! This cause is life changing for everyone involved and the goal is to grow that involvement from all aspects. By selling these hats we give you, the consumer, the opportunity to help spread this message and to wear this sick adventure hat as a badge of honor! Be proud to support this mission and the positive change we are going to make. Let’s do this together. Join the GTFO Impact! OPPORTUNITY = GROWTH“Together lets enhance the level of opportunities for these individuals.
Opportunity fuels our very being.
Opportunity gives us purpose. 
Opportunity = growth.
It’s time to give these individuals the opportunity to prove to themselves what they are truly capable of.” Chase Pettey  HOW CAN YOU MAKE AN IMPACT?GTFO gives 50% of profit when you buy a GTFO hat!Every hat was designed with intention to inspire and give back. All these hats started as adventure stories experienced by our team, and from those stories a GTFO lesson was learned and passed along to you which we printed on the inside of every hat!  What comes with this perk?
During this trip you will volunteer with the founders of GTFO and NXT Generation in Sarasota FL. during one of their many summer camps.
Witness first hand how we are enriching the lives of these individuals physically, emotionally and mentally, giving them the self confidence to excel at whatever they set their mind too.
Have a celebratory dinner with the founder of GTFO & the founder of NXT Generation.
Enjoy the last day of your trip to yourself to reset, take in the beautiful sites, and relax. After all adventuring includes some relaxation so you can reset before heading back home.

 Please help us spread this missionSpread opportunity by sharing @GTFOco on your social media platforms. First off, THANK YOU! It’s small kind acts like this that help us create opportunities for these individuals and spread the power of giving back! Let’s work together to share this mission!If you want more information or to connect with our team please don’t hesitate to comment here or message us personally! We want to connect with our customers and those that share the love for this mission! WHO ARE YOU HELPING?In our first year we will be taking these amazing individuals on an adventure of a lifetime! 
Riley, Judi, and Steve: 21, an exceptional dancer, the kindest heart you’ll ever meet, and loves to throw on boxing gloves and hit the mitts. Judi and Steve are his mom and dad and they will have the opportunity to witness Riley take on these incredible adventures the summer of 2021.
Jordan, Colleen, and Julian (brother): 20, loves training with his friends, benches 135lbs, and can do a 42in box jump! Colleen and Julian (his older brother) will have the opportunity to witness Jordan take on these incredible adventures the summer of 2021.
Josh, Lissette, and Darrell: 21, his favorite super hero’s are Superman and Batman, we call him the jump rope king, and this guy can run a 7min mile! Josh is so kind and will always check in on you to make sure you're happy! Don't we all need someone like that in our lives? Lissette and Darrell are his mom and dad and they will have the opportunity to witness Josh take on these incredible adventures the summer of 2021.
Anthony, Diane, and Michael (brother): 19, enough enthusiasm for all of us combined, never stops smiling, and man does he love staying in hotels/cabins. Diane and Michael (his younger brother) will have the opportunity to witness Anthony take on these incredible adventures the summer of 2021.
None of these amazing adventure athletes have had the opportunity to take on something this exciting and challenging. We can not wait to share their process, growth, and appreciation with all of you. Thank you for spreading the love and giving back, we are so thankful. #ITSSCIENCEGTFO gives back to help a wide range of participants with mental and physical exceptionalities. At GTFO we focus on the potential of an individual and then we help them understand and see that potential within themselves through new adventurous activities. We want to educate you on the growth that can come from outdoor adventures.Findings suggest that outdoor education and wilderness programs can foster mental health in youths, young adults and spark a child like mentality in older generations. There have been hundreds of studies done to prove the growth that comes from new adventurous experiences. How do adventures help exactly?
They take place in an unfamiliar natural physical environment, which helps a person disconnect from the daily routine allowing them the mental space to dissect their self-concept and identity.
Adventures consist of challenging activities with authentic and clear consequences that usually involve cooperation with others. Successfully trying and/or succeeding challenging activities changes an individuals outlook and attitude towards what is possible within themselves.
Most adventures take place in a small-group social setting which allows individuals to increase social skills and connect with others.
This cause is successful because of the guides provided by ASC. These individuals are experienced, skilled instructors who ensure physical safety and emotional support during the program. This allows the individuals with exceptionalities to learn new skills, build trust within others, and changes their outlook when it comes to their competence.
 BACKED BY GIVERS & ADVENTURERS. LOVED BY ALL MORE THAN A HAT. A BADGE OF HONOR.These hats are a representation of our work. The detail, the story with each hat, the lesson and the proud feeling you get knowing you gave back to an amazing cause is proof that when we say we are going to do something, we exceed ALL expectations! THESE ARE THE SICKEST HATS YOU’LL EVER OWN! THE GTFO PROCESSGiving and Adventure are the foundation of GTFO, but the opportunities we are creating for these individuals with exceptionalities will always be the mission.  This is where you come in. You can help enhance the lives of these individuals with exceptionalities by purchasing a gnarly adventure hat, donating to our mission, volunteering your time, or sharing @GTFOco on social media to spread the power of giving back. GTFO is creating life changing opportunities that these individuals will carry the rest of their lives. The process below shows the dedication our team has to expanding the opportunities for these individuals in all aspects of their life! This is where our lead partner NXT Generation comes into play! This is what NXT Generation has to say “A huge part of what we do focuses on health-minded programs exclusively for individuals with exceptionalities. We work tirelessly to find meaningful ways to enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. We put a strong emphasis on mentality through movement. By instilling the importance of physical activity and a growth mindset TODAY, we will set the groundwork for a mindfully motivated individual TOMORROW.”  - Together we work with the parents and the individuals (adventure athletes) to find a plan that is going to lead them through a successful journey. Time to instill purpose driven goals, overcoming obstacles, and hard work! Two amazing actions are being executed through this phase!1. The Kindness Krew Program - GTFO has designed a program called the “Kindness Krew” where teens have the opportunity to befriend and assist both GTFO and NXT Generation throughout the adventure training process! This program helps teens experience the power of expression, acceptance, helping others, giving, loving, and being a positive impact! This cause is life changing for everyone involved.2. These individuals with exceptionalities officially become adventure athletes as they work with NXT Generation for the next 12-16 weeks. GTFO will volunteer time and resources to assist through this part of the program. It is so important that both NXT Generation and GTFO to build trust and respect with these individuals so that we can better coach them through this process! It’s through this process that they build confidence, open mindedness, and the ability to keep trying within themselves. The moment we’ve all been working for! All the hard work has paid off and it’s time for these individuals and their parents to reap the rewards. It is on this adventure we see fears overcome, goals being exceeded, and the opportunity to prove to themselves and others that they can also do anything they set their mind too. With your help we can continue to give back to many more!On this unforgettable adventure we will be going through multiple experiences ranging from social skills, team building, and adventuring! Here are just a handful of the experiences these individuals and their parents get to experience:
Canoe/Kayak/Raft
Challenge Course
Cycling
Hiking
Rock Climbing
and much more
 You have given these individuals more than they could ever ask for! After working months to grow mentally, physically, and emotionally they have have experienced the power a single moment can have on you. When they stand on top of a mountain, when they battle the rapids in the water, or as they complete an adventure challenge course, they will experience that feeling of purpose. This part of the process can only be earned not given.This moment brings growth to the adventure athletes, the parents, the staff, and our amazing volunteers. Everyone benefits from this cause, this mission, and this purposeful moment. Our goal is to push these amazing individuals to graduate through our adventure program giving them the mental fortitude and life skills to live a purposeful life beyond the adventure trip. We will help them use the life skills they learned in this program to excel socially, within their career, and more.  HOW TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT#StrongerTogetherOur team has massive goals for this cause. We may be starting off by taking groups on adventures and selling hats to raise money for these exceptional individuals, but this is only the beginning. We plan to expand these programs by building out our own adventure camp within the next 5 years, so we can help hundreds, then thousands, and one day millions. This isn't just about helping these exceptional individuals, its about educating all of society and bringing this positivity to the world.""We all want to help one another. Human beings are likely. This world is ruled for everyone, the earth is rich, it can provide for everyone. We want to live by each others happiness, not by each others misery. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

</div></div>","To say we have a strong passion for watches is an understatement.We've frozen them, stressed them to high temperatures and tested them in all sorts of unconventional ways in order to invent something new.  The result is a watch able to amaze, a creation able to make the beholder smile... just like you will, as soon as you put our watch on your wrist. After 2 years spent researching and developing this new concept, we are proud to Introduce Kamawatch Luxe, with interchangeable bezels and watch bands.With this versatile and brilliant concept, you will get 8 different looks with 1 watch! In our office we have a pet chameleon. It's our mascot and from where the ""KAMA"" name derives from. We are always amazed when it changes color, its pure magic!Like the chameleon, this watch has the ability to change its look according to your lifestyle needs. It can transform from classic to fashionable in the blink of an eye and offers multiple unique looks within one watch.  

The quick release spring bar allows the watch to be easily transformed, customizing its look from a solid steel band to a flexible rubber band.
 Each bezel can be very easily applied and removed in seconds and were specially designed using a powerful 12-magnet, German technology that ensures the bezel remains securely attached at all times, even while doing sports and other vigorous activities
With this versatile and brilliant concept you get 8 different looks with 1 watch!!


 



Each KAMA LUXE watch comes in an elegant box (made from recycled plastic from the ocean) that includes the watch with a stainless steel band, 4 different bezels and an additional rubber band (you will be able to choose from black, white, red or green for the rubber band).
KAMA LUXE BOXKAMAWATCH has been featured in some of the largest publications in the world for bringing unusual and fun timepieces to you, like the watch that changes color with temperature. HOW TO EASILY CHANGE THE BEZELS  






Castel del Monte (Italian for ""Castle of the Mountain"") is a famous 13th-century citadel and castle situated on a hill in Andria n the Apulia region of southeast  Italy. 
It was built during the 1240s by the Emperor Frederick II and is described by the Italian  Encyclopedia as ""the most fascinating castle built by Frederick II."" The site is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The Castle has a perfectly octagonal shape, from which our watch draws inspiration for its shape.   The Castle's iconic, unique silhouette is edged on the back of the watch. 
The traditional watch market involves various middlemen standing in between the product and the customer.
Thanks to INDIEGOGO  we can use a ""direct-to-consumer"" model, cutting out distributors, wholesalers and retail stores and offer you our watch at a fraction of the Retail Price.
 For each Kama Box we remove 6 bottles from the Ocean.Plastic pollution is considered to be one of the world's most important emerging environmental problems. It is said that by 2050 oceans are expected to contain more plastics than fish. Since plastic never biodegrades, it remains in the environment forever. The persistence of plastic in the environment, in turn, reflects the world’s over consumption of plastics and the lack of systematic recycling. As such, plastic literally floods our ecosystems, in particular our aquatic ecosystems.Our box is made with recycled plastic and recycled paper and and will therefore generate a new life for this trash.  Your order comes with the BZL01, BZL02, BZL03, and BZL04 Bezels. If you want to add more bezels to your pledge order, every extra Bezel will cost $19.You can add the extra Bezels as add-ons while you check out.Note: If you choose the Bezel in Carbon Fiber ( BZL06 ) it's an extra $ 10. Our Rubber Bands are made of a superior polymer material that is waterproof and highly resistant to oils, temperature changes and harsh environments. These colored straps are durable, colorfast and extremely comfortable on the skin.  Also, every rubber band is specially designed to avoid the keeper from moving.Note:  Your order comes with one free Black rubber band.  You can add extra bands as add-ons while you check out. Note: We will contact you once you have placed your order so that you can specify the color you want.The breath taking island of Capri located in front of the Amalfi Coast is famous for many reasons. It has jaw-dropping natural beauty, delicious cuisine and world-class shopping. It's also a place to see and be seen – there's a reason why so many celebrities anchor their yachts in Marina Grande.This Kama look is inspired by Capri's beauty and elegance.Milan is known as the economic heart of Italy. Many headquarters of the financial industry are based in Milan. The city is known for its thriving fashion industry.Some of the world's famous artworks, such as Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting The Last Supper are on display in Milan.This Kama look captures the essence of this Fashion City lived with fun, happiness and harmony.Architectural shapes for the look inspired to Florence, the city noted for its culture, Renaissance art, architecture and monuments.Due to Florence's artistic and architectural heritage, it has been ranked as one of the most beautiful cities in the world.Rome, the Eternal City, is Capital of Italy is well known for historic sites such as the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and Vatican City. Rome is where the Ancient Romans created systems and structures that we still use to this day.The Kama look inspired by this city is a timeless look perfect for every occasion!Each backer is important to us since you are the ones that make this project possible with your support.

The video above shows the outstanding difference between a regular titanium material compared to the material we are using.

So started our 18-month journey into imagining, designing, redesigning and prototyping the Fanos Osimiri. After reworking the different elements of the project, we are proud to present the Osimiri, a modern diver merging a minimalistic aesthetic with functionality. We were looking for a workhorse movement that was both affordable, reliable, and well regarded among watch enthusiasts. This narrowed down our search to the ETA 2824-2 automatic Swiss movement. This selection is in line with our goal of offering a high-quality movement at a very reasonable price. Furthermore, we wanted to ensure that this watch can easily be serviced, which it certainly can, as the ETA 2824-2 is recognized by watchmakers worldwide.   Along with a 120 click coined edge titanium bezel, the Osimiri has a ceramic bezel insert that is scratch resistant and comes in a sleek and elegant matte finish. As with the rest of the watch, the markers are filled with BGW9 Super-LumiNova that allows for wonderful visibility in the dark.Credit: Relative Time  Matching the color of the bezel, the dial will also come in a grainy matte finish. The indices are nestled within a raised chapter ring that has cutouts to integrate them. The white hour and minute indices provide a stark contrast to the dial and are raised, as well as lumed with BGW9 Super-LumiNova, to again allow for clear visibility in all conditions. A date window has been seamlessly integrated at the 6 o’clock position, in order to make it more fitting with the design. We wanted to make sure that the date would not be an eyesore but rather a complementary element.    FANOS Hardened Titanium vs. Regular TitaniumWe were looking for a case material that was durable, lightweight, and scratch-resistant. This led us to make the choice of a grade 2 titanium material with a brushed finish, that has been treated with a protective coating and hardened to 900HV. Not only is it extremely scratch and corrosion-resistant, but even after prolonged use, the watch will continue to look and feel like new. The video above shows the outstanding difference between a regular titanium material compared to the material we are using. For further perspective, 316L stainless steel, used in the great majority of divers, has an HV value of 140, effectively making the Osimiri over 6 times harder than most other divers. Credit: Relative Time  In homage to classic divers, we have opted for a plongeur hand-set in a white color contrasting the dial. Wanting the look of the second hand to be cohesive with the design of the minute indices, we choose a similar oval shape but on a smaller scale. Like the rest of the watch, the hands are coated in BGW9 Super-LumiNova for optimal visibility.    The Osimiri crown is just large enough to provide a comfortable grip, all the while complementing the overall aesthetic of the watch, with an etched logo that is also lumed. To allow for the 500m depth rating, the crown has a screw-down functionality that aids in water resistance.  To allow for optimal viewing and resistance to deeper depths, the slightly domed sapphire crystal has 3 layers of anti-reflective coating on the underside. The sapphire crystal provides a more durable surface making it highly more resistant to scratches compared to a mineral crystal.   As a tool watch that is designed for extreme conditions, we have included a helium escape valve.

SOL heated jackets heat up to 130℉ or 50℃ with our inner carbon fiber heating panels, located on the inside of the jacket. Our jackets have a 700 down fill, are water resistant, windproof and even have heated fleece pockets.
 
 The heat can be controlled with our bluetooth smartphone app, available on both apple and android phones. Turn the dial to set your desired temperature.  There's 1 large heat panel on the back of the jacket, and 2 heat panels on the front. The two heat panels on the front provide you with heated pockets.  Footage of the jacket: Our heat panels are soft and comfortable. Allowing you to comfortably feel the heat all over your body.  The jackets last between 2-8 hours, depending on what temperature the jacket is running on.  The jackets can also be turned on and controlled with the inner button. Hold the button for 5 seconds to turn the heating on. Press the button again to choose from high, medium, and low. The button is located on the inside of the upper left chest.  We worked with experienced clothing designers and jacket manufacturers to design a heated jacket that was both functional and stylish. (It looks and feels like a $500 jacket).  Testimonials:We got random people on the streets of Vancouver to try our heated jackets...  The SOL battery (which is included with every jacket), can also charge your phone and devices on the go. It uses USB-C charging, allowing the battery to re-charge within 4 hours. With every jacket you will receive a SOL battery and SOL charger.   Inner phone pocket on the inside of the jacket, equipped with YKK zippers.  Fleece lined heated pockets, keeping your hands cozy on those frosty days.  YKK Waterproof Zippers.

Style Manual. Since 2014, I have been sharing simple and practical style advice with the goal to
help my readers look their best.
During this process, <b>I began questioning the limited accessories provided for men in the market place</b>. There are not enough retailers
that offer bold and exquisite statement pieces. As someone who uses accessories to transform an outfit from ordinary to dapper, this was a constant obstacle. Hence I
took matters into my own hands and the first line of striking men's accessories by the Simple Style Manual was created.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><u>The Purpose</u></span></h2><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><u><br/></u></span></div><div>
<p>I want to share my passion for style and fashion with the world.
<b>I truly believe presenting your best self to the world is the easiest step we can take in getting what we want in life</b>.<b> </b> First impression sets the tone in every relationship and your style is the game changer.  I am proud to be in the position to introduce alternative designs in pocket squares and accessories. </p>
<p><b>My mission is to equip every man with an arsenal of striking accessories to make a statement in all situations. </b>The accessories being offered is for men who dares to be different.  For men who does not want to settle for mass produced accessories with ordinary designs.  Defy the standard and look exceptional for every occasion.  </p>
<p>This campaign will raise the capital required to assemble the first line of men's accessories, set up the infrastructure for an online store, and build an inventory of high quality products.  With your support, <b>the Simple Style Manual will thrive to become a respected source of unique lifestyle and fashion products for men internationally</b>.</p>

squares offered online and in stores? Would you like to add a personal touch

The Genesis
I am the editor of a men's style advice website, the Simple
Style Manual. Since 2014, I have been sharing simple and practical style advice with the goal to
help my readers look their best.
During this process, I began questioning the limited accessories provided for men in the market place. There are not enough retailers
that offer bold and exquisite statement pieces. As someone who uses accessories to transform an outfit from ordinary to dapper, this was a constant obstacle. Hence I
took matters into my own hands and the first line of striking men's accessories by the Simple Style Manual was created.The Purpose
I want to share my passion for style and fashion with the world.
I truly believe presenting your best self to the world is the easiest step we can take in getting what we want in life.  First impression sets the tone in every relationship and your style is the game changer.  I am proud to be in the position to introduce alternative designs in pocket squares and accessories. 
My mission is to equip every man with an arsenal of striking accessories to make a statement in all situations. The accessories being offered is for men who dares to be different.  For men who does not want to settle for mass produced accessories with ordinary designs.  Defy the standard and look exceptional for every occasion.  
This campaign will raise the capital required to assemble the first line of men's accessories, set up the infrastructure for an online store, and build an inventory of high quality products.  With your support, the Simple Style Manual will thrive to become a respected source of unique lifestyle and fashion products for men internationally.

Simple Style Manual Presents: Striking Suit Accessories for the Brave


Are you tired of the basic colours and patterns for pocket
squares offered online and in stores? Would you like to add a personal touch
to your pocket square? Do you want a pocket square that is carefully handcrafted in North America in limited quantity? The pocket squares offered to supporters of
this campaign is the solution. Using high quality materials and timeless designs I sourced locally, each pocket square is carefully handcrafted in a small batch production process in North America. This means only a limited quantity is produced of each design, making your pocket square rare and unique. The best part is—it's customizable! 


Looking over the shoulder of my seamstress.





Sample of color borders, (left to right): orange, black, and red.





Certain designs look best without added colors hence we recommend a borderless design. 


Along with the pocket squares, backers can purchase
bracelets and lapel pins. These exquisite accessories add interest to an outfit and makes a man look modern and polished. Included below are photos of me wearing my prized accessories for your reference.

<p>Thanks for taking interest in our project. If you're here it's because you love watches and want to help others...  So lets get started.</p>
<p>The GRAN MARE (Gran Ma-Re) watch is Human Time Project's first Swiss made model. <br/></p>
<p>For those who don't know us HUMAN TIME PROJECT was founded 3 years ago by Gustavo Sainz and Ben Rodriguez to design rugged/fun affordable watches while donating a watch for every one sold to healthcare workers in developing countries. We've been featured in the past on prestigious men's blogs like BLESS THIS STUFF, COOL MATERIAL, GEAR PATROL and HOODINKEE.<br/></p>
<p> After 5 successful model launches we've been able to donate over 740 watches. All this with simple organic and social media support while not spending one cent in advertizing, and that's maybe why you've never heard of us : ) .  During this time many have asked us to design a Swiss model and now we think the perfect moment has come. After meeting with the right manufacturer and 7 months of studies and designs we have reached what we think is not only the most cool looking and affordable Swiss watch out there, but also the only model behind a 'Buy One Give Another' program. With your support for every watch ordered another will be donated to a healthcare worker in a developing country.<br/></p>
<p>Of course the cost of manufacturing a Swiss watch is not inexpensive and we need to order hundreds to keep the price point accessible so we're asking you guys for your support in not only bringing a great design to life but to also help others in the process. </p>
<p>For your support you get a 40% SAVINGS on the final retail price  of the watch - <br/></p>
<p>A     GREAT    DEAL  !! <br/></p>
<p>We know that there are a lot of start-up watch companies asking for your support but we'd like to assure you that we are not new to watch design and manufacturing having developed 5 models to market and one previous Swiss model with our partner SAINZ Watch Co.<br/></p>
<p>WHAT DO YOU GET ?</p>
<p>A great Swiss made watch at an amazing price from an experienced watch company while helping others <br/></p>
<p>WHAT DO WE GET  ?</p>
<p>Our design to come to life and be able to give watches to healthcare workers around the world who need them to practice medicine.</p>
<p>WHAT DO OTHERS GET ?</p>
<p>More watches in medical workers hands that one day will probably save a life.</p>
<p>So are you ready to get started? ...  Let's go !<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>THE 'GRAN MARE' SWISS WATCH</h3>
<p><br/></p> <p>Truthfully the world really doesn't need another watch... But more people helping others? - Well, that's exactly what the world needs!  <br/></p>
<p>And if you happen to get a watch in the process...  Even better.<br/></p>
<p>There has been a great explosion in Asian made watches with quartz and automatic movements and while they are great timepieces there is a reason why Switzerland is still the pinnacle of watch making. There is strict quality controls and pride in craftsmanship that are unique to the region. Not to mention fair working and trade conditions. But all this comes at a price and since we are required a certain production number of units we are asking for your support in making this happen.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is to fund the manufacturing of the watches along with it's accessories and packaging.</p>
<p>THE GRAN MARE - DESIGN and SPECS</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443594073/ct7tbissw1rmug9jr7nu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 502.488px; height: 283px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>When we set out to create the GRAN MARE we asked... What is the most versatile design out there used by most active lifestyle people ? <br/></p>
<p>Two models came to mind : </p>
<p>1) The classic DIVER  </p>
<p>2) The classic CHRONOGRAPH... <br/></p>
<p>So we decided why don't we use both functions into a watch that looks cool and inspiring but isn't too over designed and big. Watch sizes are also an issue these days. On one side we have the classic 'Rolex' case size of 40mm that although fashionable is a bit small for men in active lifestyles, but on the other hand of the spectrum a 50 mm  case seems too large and cumbersome. So we decided middle ground was the best and opted for a 44/45 mm case size that is not too big nor too small... Like 'Goldilocks' would say : Just right.</p>
<p>We wanted the watch to be resistant to use so we requested the use of 316L stainless steel case with a mirror polish and extra hard mineral glass. All this with a high quality RONDA Swiss quartz movement with long life battery that doesn't need resetting every time you take off the watch.<br/></p>
<p>The movement was a hard choice to decide as price points will always dictate the outcome. We wanted Swiss manufacture and quality but Swiss automatics where pricey. Quality Swiss quartz movements where the next best thing. Also we wanted the watch to be affordable and good but didn't want to ask $1,000.00  either. We could have gone with a more inexpensive Japanese automatic movement but then it would have defeated the purpose of Swiss Made. <br/></p>
<p>So we chose the quartz chronograph movement to give you the best deal you'll ever see on a exclusively designed Swiss made watch,</p>
<p>S P E C S  :</p>
<p>Manufacture : 100 % Swiss Made<br/></p>
<p>Case : 45 mm 316L Stainless Steel/ Mirror polish</p>
<p>Movement : Ronda high rotation quartz chronograph movement</p>
<p>Bezel :  Red Marked 15 min. Point / fixed for lifelong water resistance</p>
<p>Strap Option # 1 :  High end Italian rubber/silicon with basket weave pattern</p>
<p>Strap Option # 2 :  Solid Stainless Steel</p>
<p>Water Resistant :  100 Meters</p>
<p>Back Case :  Engraved Triton Gran Mare logo <br/></p>
<p>Large Luxury box</p>
<p>P E R K S  :<br/></p>
<p>Our perks are very easy to explain :</p>
<p>THEY ARE A GREAT DEAL !</p>
<p>You'll be getting a once a lifetime opportunity to buy the watch at a 40% discount from the MSRP of $360 that will be asked once the watch goes on sale to the regular public.</p>
<p>And a EXCLUSIVE Navy Blue luxury box - Only available to our INDIGOGO supporters.</p>
<p>And if you want to load on the savings get our AWESOME Christmas Pack with 2 watches and an incredible discount ! !<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>NOTE : We extremely value your support and in the eventual case we do not reach our funding goal we will evaluate if we can deliver on what was promised and if not all monies will be promptly refunded.<br/>

From first-aid, responding to a trauma, checking vital signs, treating a cardiac arrest or administering anti-venom a working watch can mean life or death to many people if the practitioner doesn't have a proper timepiece as a tool.</p>
<p>In our last 3 years we have been able to donate over 740 watches to healthcare workers in developing countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and other regions of Central America. With more donations programmed for winter 2015 to other locations.<br/></p>
<p>We use the help of many NPO's and NGO's such as HELPS International and other smaller partners in the region to distribute our watches to those in need in the medical field.<br/></p>

<p>We have the knowledge and know-how to design, source, ship and distribute these watches on a reasonable time frame. Also we have a good relationship with our factory in Switzerland, which is ready to start production once funding is reached,  that will ensure we have a good product delivered on time. So happily we don't have to scramble to find a manufacturer once we get funded or hope they do a good job.<br/></p>

<p><strong>Loc8er Mobile App - Stay Safe, Have Fun!</strong></p>

</div></div>","""Someone needed to design something to keep kids safer...so I did""   Dean Corrigan,  Inventor of Loc8er:Mobile App, 2014 Wall-Street.com
 

 

 


Finally we're ready to launch Loc8er Mobile App! In just a few clicks you will be connecting with your children while they play or walk home from school.  We're here to help you keep an eye on your children and loved ones; we all want them out playing, and pushing for more independence!
We've brought you the original watch-based concept of Loc8er Mobile (and more!) in an app, instead.  More importantly - we've decided to give you it all for FREE! 

Get started now by downloading the Parent App:

 
 
 
 

 

Download one App per phone,  sync the PARENTS APP to the KIDS APP using an authorisation code, and get planning!  If you've got more than one child, or are looking after your friend's kids for the day; we've got you covered - you can sync an unlimited number of Kids Apps to the Parents App, and create 'Groups' so that you can track and message them collectively.  Safety First!
  The App includes FREE text messaging so you can keep in touch with each other, and oversee the kid's 'real-time' location via Google Maps (and eventually, free calls! That's why we're on here!)
Loc8er Mobile App gives you PEACE OF MIND!

Plan routes for the kids with the 'Journey Planner' with optional 'Safe Zones' of 100m radius - if your child wanders out of the 'safe zone' you'll immediately receive an alert to let you know!
In close proximity, you can easily find your kids in a busy crowded area.
You'll also receive an alert when your child 'checks-in' at their destination, so you can rest assured that they've arrived safely.
Whether they're walking to school, playing in the park or in a busy crowd, you'll always know exactly where your loved ones are, at the touch of a button.



 

We believe every child should have the opportunity to go out and play safely and worry-free in their community, so giving children back some of their independence whilst quietly overseeing their location, is high on our priority list, and we're pretty sure it's high on yours.  Our data and GPS services are stored and run over an SSL-certified, secure Amazon web server.  
We've added in a 'hidden' 4-digit-security-code function, so that there's no chance of their personal email addresses or passwords being on display when kids are logging in.
And as if that wasn't secure enough, we've added a special encryption function on all passwords and  in-app messages!
Check out the distance tracker; it's a cool pedometer which counts kids' steps, gauges their distance traveled every day and encourages them to live more active lifestyles!
There's also fun Loc8ion-based-games, where they can earn Explorer Badges, and be rewarded for their efforts.
You can download both of the Kid apps from the App Store and Google Play Store using the links below:

 

 

 

By donating you'll be showing your support for global child safety, and helping us create worldwide awareness of this amazing app!
We want to reach as many mums, dads and guardians as possible through the power of advertising.  Not only that, but there is potential for us to reach many other 'target markets' such as older-teens/young twenty-somethings who eg. spend hours trying to find each other at festivals (we've all been there before...!) and of course, older family members (who can wander off indiscriminately) so this app can be utilised in various ways.

 



 
We're already grateful that you're showing your support by taking the time to read our campaign, and we'll be even MORE grateful when we hit our £10,000 target and see all of your donations flooding in!  
Here's where your donations will be going:

 FREE in-app calls are going to be included in the new build - we want to make it even EASIER and CHEAPER for you to stay in touch.
The free messaging service will be updated using an 'XMPP Services chat facility' - think 'Whatsapp' - to give users a better experience.
There will be even more games for the kids, motivating them to get out there and enjoy the great outdoors!
You'll be able to view multiple Kid Apps at once, rather than just one at a time.
We want to make sure Loc8er Mobile App is accessible for everybody, including non-English speakers; so with that in mind, we'll be translating the app in to as many languages as we can!
We want to continue making ongoing updates and improvements to the User Interface (UI) -  YOUR FEEDBACK IS INVALUABLE TO US!  
Even more importantly, we'll constantly be ensuring that our web security system is the most current and up to date
Our aim is to reach as many people as we possibly can, so a large percentage of the donations will go towards a larger-scale advertising campaign, helping us create worldwide awareness.

    The 17th centuary Wanli Shipwreck treasure, reveals a masterclass of Chinese art history. A wide range of rare Ming porcelain wares and art. From an era when ming porcelain was a valuable commodity to trade, converted by royal courts and high society across western world. And remains unchanged till this day.







Tears of Ming  Porcelain Jewellery, handmade from Genuine Ming Dynasty porcelain shards, exclusive sourced from the Wanli shipwreck circa 1625. Importantly, guarantees provenance and authenticity.







Transformation journey begins with restoration of Ming porcelain artefact (shard), to almost mint conditions. Rehabilitate for prized Ming Blue and White porcelain ceramic art



Strategy built on renewed aesthetics of 'form and function' while preserving the integrity of Ming Blue and white porcelain art.   Reinvented and hand forged as Artisan Jewellery and Accessories


Showcases rare and complex Ming porcelain art themes, miniature medallions, single, double and triple art motif designs, reflecting the philosophies of the time. 
Inherent cultural belief systems and iconic representation, including sanskrit symbolism of an ancient Asian legacy, long before western civilisation. 


Featuring portraits and landscape of nature, the insect and animal kingdom, heavenly and supernatural creatures, including mythical folklore.                            










Design and reframed with space and balance, capturing the essence of rare Ming Dynasty porcelain art. Utilizing natural, vintage and modern/geometric design principles to formalize a renewed art perspective and value. 
Not just to be appreciated aesthetically as exotic works of art, but for their symbolic representation and associated emotive values. In essence, resonate values that form real connection with customers. Individual personality with a story to share. 


DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENCES OUR-SELF FROM THE REST







Furthermore, its natural ergonomic form compliments the beauty of physical body. Attributed to contoured shape and function of a past existence.   








Displayed as works of art, not in the traditional sense, but evolved, handcrafted position. To flourish as personal jewellery. Admired, cherish and loved - as its preordain destiny, in the first place.      





Initial Tears of Ming Jewellery collection, includes necklace pendants, rings, bracelet and cufflink.
Soon, expanding our range with new designs for belts, charm bracelet and earnings (currently, developing prototypes for internal review)New handcrafted 925 Sterling Sliver jewellery setting adds prestige and uplifts the elegance of the piece  









Tears of Ming embodies the spirit Ming ceramic artisan. Uncovering insights, the hidden significance, motives or Ming art history symbolism of Ming Dynasty era.




True stories (untold stories), and secrets. Not widely known facts, associated to myriad of ancient Ming art symbolism and motifs, Discover a hidden world of Ming art, romantically embedded within its core design, emanating confidence and goodwill to its owner.

Lotus flower is a symbol of purity, and enlightenment. Considered a sacred Buddhist symbol (one of Eight Auspicious Symbols)
Representing
purity and detachment from worldly cares. Emblem
of redemption and purity: it grows out of mud but its blossom is undefiled.



 





Featuring Core Designs of  Ming Dynasty theme inspired art, motifs of nature and all living creature- plant life and flowers, birds and insets, animals, including mythical & heavenly creatures of legends.



Symbolic Icons, ancient motifs, reveal inherent Chinese cultural beliefs and behavior, including
revered symbolism, auspicious greeting, omens and hidden messages 
Ming Porcelain art is valued, judged by the painting quality and craftsmanship, condition of the porcelain and importantly, the rarity of painted motif or design are determining factors of value and price 




For example, the rare double motif design of a grasshopper and Cicada can be traced to only one intact ming porcelain ware from the Wanli Porcelain Cargo circa 1625




The ruyi considered
one of the Eight Treasures, scepter of power. The ruyi head motif represented power and
authority. An important art motif, sharing designs with a host of connected symbolism

BELOVED PEONY FLOWER
Interestingly, reveals the other side of her personality. her true nature, emotional values - her inner beauty and grace. Represented through the Ming Art reverse peony  design theme




While painted peony subject reflects Wealth and Nobility. See at the Imperial Court gardens. Known as the 'King of Flowers. The most exquisite flower to the Chinese. A symbol of
spring. 






""Squirrel in grapes foliage"" Ming art  theme. Fruit of the wealthy & entitled. Squirrels are known home-makers and motivated providers. Collectively, it means happiness for many generations and many grandchildren



Butterfly. Much loved art subject by poet and painters alike. with stories and tales  








 


                   





(where there is absolute proof on the origin of where the artifacts came from)
We have gone to great lengths to substantiate our claim beyond reproach,which i believe are key building blocks of the business - stature, trust and expertise 



Documentary, actual video footage. Embedded at top of the page.  ie. Wanli shipwreck and Ming porcelain cargo, the discovery, underwater excavation.   
If it has perked your interest. Watch 4-part History Channel mini documentaries. ""Treasures of Nanhai"" Hosted by the maverick shipwreck .
Each and every piece of Ming porcelain shards are carefully selected and researched,cross reference  to trace its origins. Identified through the published Wanli shipwreck and ming porcelain artifacts                                                                                          I prefer to address this issue upfront, with the aim to build trust and transparence. Reassuring customers the authenticity of our 17th century Ming porcelain jewellery


 



1. Flip
over reverse side of the piece and you will see a distinctive worn-out effect, inner ceramic design or foot ring
2. Furthermore, the off white clay constitution and color are key indicators of its 400 year old heritage vs. the pristine white, glossy finish of reproduction/fakes. 
These traits are distinctive signatures, attributed to only shipwreck artefacts
3. Reproduction/fake Ming porcelain ware are mint intact pieces, covering a couple of popular Ming Blue & white designs which are priced ridiculously high  
4.
Our collection features range of ming art paintings and motifs which you will not find anywhere else in the world, except from The Wanli shipwreck or in museums/private collection exhibits.                           

                                                                                                   




Journey of discovery and renewal, rather than, a process. Commences with the conservation led restoration regiment, as shipwreck ceramics requires rigorous desalination and deep cleaning baths.





A
low impact process to dissolve and remove 400 years of marine growth, embedded
sand and foreign matter from the monsoon infested south china sea.


Finally, revealing its beauty of Ming Blue & White ceramic art 
This is probably the most rewarding part of the process.

The
pre-production phase comprises of two key tasks ie. Design prep and research to determine
origins and symbolism it represents of its ceramic art





Only hand mechanised tools are used to gradually shaping each and
very piece. Painstakingly, slow to account for the different porcelain shard texture and dimensions, working along the
natural shard contour and fault lines. 
The
journey doesn't
end
here. In collaboration, a balinese handmade sterling sliver workshop exceeded expectations and quality finish



The immediate need for skill manpower and retooling of the workshop which will double productivity and produce a better finish product 
Importantly, the funds to solidify our position through volume acquisition of quality ming Dynasty porcelain shards. Including, a comprehensive range of rare ming porcelain centre medallion 
A key business resource of rare Ming Art and designs which i believe has potential to seed growth and long-term sustainability
Ultimately, your support and contributions are important to us, not just monetarily but, the opportunity to engage and involve to help improve our brand and products.



In turn, my gratitude and fortitude can only be demonstrate through contributor perks which are exclusive, rare, limited volume rewards, custom-made for you. A treasured value way beyond it price position.

The biggest challenge is to make my bracelets known by others. Are similar online stores with same products like mine, but are at a higher price, and i think this is one of my advantage.
For this i will start do some collaboration with notorious person here in Romania and not just here, so they will promote my little business instead of products and other benefits.

Are you tired of the broken or the yellowing linkage between your fob and key blank? 

We believe we've got the perfect solution for you! 

Introducing the UniLink. 


The UniLink is the perfect solution to the common problem that the majority of the Lotus owners have. 

The UniLink is made from 7075 Aluminum Alloy also known as the aircraft grade aluminum. Its high fatigue strength and durability are exactly what we need to build a long lasting linkage between your fob and key. 


No More broken key fob on your track day!  

No More ugly looking rubber strap on your exotic car key!

No More worry about pulling your key out of your pocket fast when you need to!


The design inspiration came from the popular Lotus wheel, the Forged LSS wheel. The UniLink itself is just like a mini version of the LSS wheel spoke and we believe it's a great way to make it look like an OEM product. 

Not very long ago we raised $17,000 for the Lotus UniKey project. The campaign was a huge success and the products were fully delivered.

<p><b>THE WELLINGTON &amp; CROMWELL ORIGIN STORY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I purchased a cool looking ""Alibaba bag"" on ebay for $40.  It was a copy of a Belstaff Colonial 554 (retail $385) that was worn by Will Smith in ""I am Legend"" and Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" but the quality of the ""Alibaba bag"" sucked.  The cotton canvas was cheap and thin and the ""leather"" looked like plastic.<br/><br/>But since I liked the style and utility of the bag, I looked for a way to reproduce it with the best materials and construction. I also made design improvements to the ""Will Smith"" bag, adding a zipper closure, a laptop computer compartment, pen and business card holders, and straps to hold an umbrella.  </p>
<p>I sourced expensive English bridle leather and 22oz cotton canvas from the British Millerain Mill and reconstructed the ""Will Smith"" bag.  I loved the finished product and to my surprise, the bag was still cheaper than a Designer Brand. (note: for a one off sample my production cost was three to four times the mass production price, which is the price for a minimum order of 500.  At this sample price, the bag was still 50% less than a Designer Brand using similar materials and construction.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431840629/sqrygsmdqzrklbuxnemq.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>Alibaba bag (top) vs. Wellington &amp; Cromwell Adventurer Satchel (bottom)<p><br/></p>
<p>The best analogy I can make is this:</p>
<div>You can get a 1 carat Tiffany diamond engagement ring for $15,000. You can spec the same exact diamond, like testing in a laboratory chemically the same, on Bluenile for $7,500, or you can buy a cubic zirconia that looks similar to both the above for $25 on Amazon. The Alibaba bag is the cubic zirconia, my Wellington &amp; Cromwell bag is the Bluenile, and a Designer Brand bag is the Tiffany in this analogy.  But its not a perfect analogy because Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags use BETTER materials than most Designer Brands.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That's when I realized this could be a business opportunity and that there might be other people out there like me looking for high quality well made luxury goods offered at a fair price.  That's why I created Wellington &amp; Cromwell.</div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I designed and developed a few more bags for my personal use and I received tons of compliments on the bags.  My business plan for Wellington &amp; Cromwell is to charge somewhere between 2x and 3x my FOB (freight on board) price for each bag which would still make Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags 33% to 66% less expensive than bags from comparable Designer Brands.</p>
<p>I am hoping there are people out there who believe in my vision of high quality luxury goods offered at a fair price.  If you do, please support the Wellington &amp; Cromwell Indiegogo Campaign.</p>
</div>
<p><b>YOUR JOURNEY BEGINS...</b></p>
<p>My vision for the Wellington &amp; Cromwell Project is to create the most beautiful, well-made, heirloom quality luxury goods at an accessible price point for travelers, adventurers, and explorers. </p>
<p>Wellington &amp; Cromwell creates moral and economic dignity for workers by paying them a fair wage for crafting a beautiful luxury good, and for consumers by offering a luxury good where the value is inherent in the ethical craftsmanship, not wasted in retail markups, celebrity endorsements, and high fashion marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Our project's definition of quality considers three primary factors; design, materials, and craftsmanship. </p>
<p><b>DESIGN</b></p>
<p>Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags are inspired by the classic vintage military duffel bag and motorcycle messenger dispatch bag because so much of men's style is inspired by military functionality, e.g. aviator sunglasses, navy peacoats, cargo pants, M-65 field jackets, B-3 bomber leather jackets, etc.  Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags are stylish and rugged, suitable for the office or for adventure.</p>
<p><b>MATERIALS</b></p>
<p>Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags are crafted from the most suitable and authentic materials.  We use natural super heavy duty 24oz waxed cotton canvas and the two best grades of leather, natural full-grain and top-grain leather.  </p>
<p>We don't use genuine leather or bonded leather which is just scrap leather reconstituted into something resembling leather, like how meat slurry is made into chicken nuggets or ""all beef"" hamburger patties. We don't use nylon or other synthetic materials because they are inferior to natural materials except for certain specific applications, e.g. the corporate logo bags you get for free at job fairs.</p>
<p><b>CRAFTSMANSHIP</b></p>
<p>Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags are crafted to the high standards equal to or above any other luxury product currently on the market, with the exception of truly artisanal brands like Hermes or Brunello Cucinelli.  The bags are crafted by experienced artisans working in a modern facility using the best tooling available.  Everything is double stitched, seams are reinforced, high quality treated brass hardware is used.</p>

<p>This reward will be available to all Backers, even at the $1 level. We know it is a big commitment to back a stranger on Indiegogo so it was important for us to demonstrate a reciprocal commitment to our Backers and show our appreciation for your support, even $1 of support and sharing our Indiegogo video on Facebook and Twitter will help launch Wellington &amp; Cromwell.    </p>
<p>We thought long and hard about an economically feasible reward for $1 that would still be fun and cool and we came up with the idea of turning the Wellington &amp; Cromwell Logo into a wearable pin.</p>
<p>This pin is a treated brass replica of ""Edward Wellington's Lucky Spanish Doubloon"" affixed to all Wellington &amp; Cromwell Bags. Its an Eight Escudo Coin belonging to Edward Wellington, long believed to have been lost during a drinking game in Siam. Recently found in the library of Cloudfall Manor in Scotland, nestled between the pages of a first edition of Around the World in 80 Days.</p>

<p>For those special backers who become founding members of the Wellington &amp; Cromwell Gentleman Explorer Club, we have a very special artifact reward, Henry Cromwell's Compass. </p>
<p> The 45mm diameter brass compass is engraved on the front with, ""Not all those who wander are lost"" a line from a poem in Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. The backside is engraved ""HCC"" for Henry Cornelius Cromwell, the Legendary Gentleman Explorer to whom this compass once belonged.</p>
<p>We hope you will carry this treasure on your person as a daily reminder to take every opportunity to adventure, discover, and explore.</p>

<p><b>THE DESIGN PROCESS</b></p>
<p>I take the best features of expensive designer bags I own to create ""Frankenbags.""  Like Doctor Frankenstein, but with a bag, meaning that I mix parts, e.g. handles, shoulder straps, zippers, storm flaps, pockets, internal compartments, etc. of each designer bag like how Dr. Frankenstein stitched together different body parts to create his perfect monster.</p>
<p>I then work with the manufacturer to create paper patterns from which we cut the leather and canvas and stitch those pieces together to create a sample of the real bag.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Logo design for metal molding"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/791/747/e14b6b345df2a2369e2379b48b7483a5_original.jpg?v=1431624876&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=5ec150efb0889ca08250cbbb5b60405b"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Logo design for metal molding</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>We had four primary goals for the design of the Wellington &amp; Cromwell logo which would be affixed to all our bags.</p>
<p>1. It had to be discreet, not too blingy, yet still be able to immediately communicate to the user quality, refinement, and authenticity.  From this we knew it had to be small enough to be subtle and difficult to counterfeit.</p>
<p>2. It couldn't be ridiculously expensive to fabricate but still had to meet the requirements in goal #1.</p>
<p>3. It had to fit with the overall theme of Wellington &amp; Cromwell i.e. ""gentleman explorers,"" adventure, exploration, travel, vintage, natural materials (not plastic)</p>
<p>4. It had to be more beautiful, fun, and cool than any logo currently in the marketplace.</p>
<p>We eventually settled on a treasure coin because it communicated all the things we wanted our logo to communicate:</p>
<p>1. looks valuable</p>
<p>2. small enough to be discreet (size of US quarter) yet visible enough</p>
<p>3. made of metal so its hard to counterfeit</p>
<p>4. its fun and cool because the coin evokes pirates and sunken treasure</p>
<p>5. The aged effect of the coin fits with the overall Wellington &amp; Cromwell theme</p>
<p>The logo runners up in order were a nude mermaid, a horned owl, and a mallard duck</p>
<p></p>

<p>The design process is a bit of a misnomer because it takes hundreds of hours of collaboration between designer, developer, and manufacturing to bring a Wellington &amp; Cromwell bag to life.</p>
<p>If we gave our designer free reign, he would specify that Wellington &amp; Cromwell bags be made of dragonhide and unicorn horns.  Its the developer that is responsible for making sure that a design can actually be made into a physical object while still fully capturing the essence of the designer's creativity.</p>
<p>The developer then works with manufacturing to ensure that the product can be made consistently and efficiently.</p>

THE WELLINGTON & CROMWELL ORIGIN STORY

I purchased a cool looking ""Alibaba bag"" on ebay for $40.  It was a copy of a Belstaff Colonial 554 (retail $385) that was worn by Will Smith in ""I am Legend"" and Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" but the quality of the ""Alibaba bag"" sucked.  The cotton canvas was cheap and thin and the ""leather"" looked like plastic.But since I liked the style and utility of the bag, I looked for a way to reproduce it with the best materials and construction. I also made design improvements to the ""Will Smith"" bag, adding a zipper closure, a laptop computer compartment, pen and business card holders, and straps to hold an umbrella.  
I sourced expensive English bridle leather and 22oz cotton canvas from the British Millerain Mill and reconstructed the ""Will Smith"" bag.  I loved the finished product and to my surprise, the bag was still cheaper than a Designer Brand. (note: for a one off sample my production cost was three to four times the mass production price, which is the price for a minimum order of 500.  At this sample price, the bag was still 50% less than a Designer Brand using similar materials and construction.)

Alibaba bag (top) vs. Wellington & Cromwell Adventurer Satchel (bottom)
The best analogy I can make is this:
You can get a 1 carat Tiffany diamond engagement ring for $15,000. You can spec the same exact diamond, like testing in a laboratory chemically the same, on Bluenile for $7,500, or you can buy a cubic zirconia that looks similar to both the above for $25 on Amazon. The Alibaba bag is the cubic zirconia, my Wellington & Cromwell bag is the Bluenile, and a Designer Brand bag is the Tiffany in this analogy.  But its not a perfect analogy because Wellington & Cromwell bags use BETTER materials than most Designer Brands.

That's when I realized this could be a business opportunity and that there might be other people out there like me looking for high quality well made luxury goods offered at a fair price.  That's why I created Wellington & Cromwell.


I designed and developed a few more bags for my personal use and I received tons of compliments on the bags.  My business plan for Wellington & Cromwell is to charge somewhere between 2x and 3x my FOB (freight on board) price for each bag which would still make Wellington & Cromwell bags 33% to 66% less expensive than bags from comparable Designer Brands.
I am hoping there are people out there who believe in my vision of high quality luxury goods offered at a fair price.  If you do, please support the Wellington & Cromwell Indiegogo Campaign.

YOUR JOURNEY BEGINS...
My vision for the Wellington & Cromwell Project is to create the most beautiful, well-made, heirloom quality luxury goods at an accessible price point for travelers, adventurers, and explorers. 
Wellington & Cromwell creates moral and economic dignity for workers by paying them a fair wage for crafting a beautiful luxury good, and for consumers by offering a luxury good where the value is inherent in the ethical craftsmanship, not wasted in retail markups, celebrity endorsements, and high fashion marketing campaigns.
Our project's definition of quality considers three primary factors; design, materials, and craftsmanship. 
DESIGN
Wellington & Cromwell bags are inspired by the classic vintage military duffel bag and motorcycle messenger dispatch bag because so much of men's style is inspired by military functionality, e.g. aviator sunglasses, navy peacoats, cargo pants, M-65 field jackets, B-3 bomber leather jackets, etc.  Wellington & Cromwell bags are stylish and rugged, suitable for the office or for adventure.
MATERIALS
Wellington & Cromwell bags are crafted from the most suitable and authentic materials.  We use natural super heavy duty 24oz waxed cotton canvas and the two best grades of leather, natural full-grain and top-grain leather.  
We don't use genuine leather or bonded leather which is just scrap leather reconstituted into something resembling leather, like how meat slurry is made into chicken nuggets or ""all beef"" hamburger patties. We don't use nylon or other synthetic materials because they are inferior to natural materials except for certain specific applications, e.g. the corporate logo bags you get for free at job fairs.
CRAFTSMANSHIP
Wellington & Cromwell bags are crafted to the high standards equal to or above any other luxury product currently on the market, with the exception of truly artisanal brands like Hermes or Brunello Cucinelli.  The bags are crafted by experienced artisans working in a modern facility using the best tooling available.  Everything is double stitched, seams are reinforced, high quality treated brass hardware is used.

V. Unique Indiegogo Backer Rewards

Henry Cromwell's Compass and Edward Wellington's Lucky Spanish Doubloon Pin
Finally, Wellington & Cromwell is proud to introduce two very special Indiegogo Backer rewards, Edward Wellington's Lucky Spanish Doubloon Pin and Henry Cromwell's Compass.
Edward Wellington's Lucky Spanish Doubloon Pin

Edward Wellington's Lucky Spanish Doubloon worn as a lapel pin
This reward will be available to all Backers, even at the $1 level. We know it is a big commitment to back a stranger on Indiegogo so it was important for us to demonstrate a reciprocal commitment to our Backers and show our appreciation for your support, even $1 of support and sharing our Indiegogo video on Facebook and Twitter will help launch Wellington & Cromwell.    
We thought long and hard about an economically feasible reward for $1 that would still be fun and cool and we came up with the idea of turning the Wellington & Cromwell Logo into a wearable pin.
This pin is a treated brass replica of ""Edward Wellington's Lucky Spanish Doubloon"" affixed to all Wellington & Cromwell Bags. Its an Eight Escudo Coin belonging to Edward Wellington, long believed to have been lost during a drinking game in Siam. Recently found in the library of Cloudfall Manor in Scotland, nestled between the pages of a first edition of Around the World in 80 Days.

The Wellington & Cromwell logo was inspired by pirate treasure
Henry Cromwell's Compass


For those special backers who become founding members of the Wellington & Cromwell Gentleman Explorer Club, we have a very special artifact reward, Henry Cromwell's Compass. 
 The 45mm diameter brass compass is engraved on the front with, ""Not all those who wander are lost"" a line from a poem in Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. The backside is engraved ""HCC"" for Henry Cornelius Cromwell, the Legendary Gentleman Explorer to whom this compass once belonged.
We hope you will carry this treasure on your person as a daily reminder to take every opportunity to adventure, discover, and explore.


THE DESIGN PROCESS
I take the best features of expensive designer bags I own to create ""Frankenbags.""  Like Doctor Frankenstein, but with a bag, meaning that I mix parts, e.g. handles, shoulder straps, zippers, storm flaps, pockets, internal compartments, etc. of each designer bag like how Dr. Frankenstein stitched together different body parts to create his perfect monster.
I then work with the manufacturer to create paper patterns from which we cut the leather and canvas and stitch those pieces together to create a sample of the real bag.

Logo design for metal molding
We had four primary goals for the design of the Wellington & Cromwell logo which would be affixed to all our bags.
1. It had to be discreet, not too blingy, yet still be able to immediately communicate to the user quality, refinement, and authenticity.  From this we knew it had to be small enough to be subtle and difficult to counterfeit.
2. It couldn't be ridiculously expensive to fabricate but still had to meet the requirements in goal #1.
3. It had to fit with the overall theme of Wellington & Cromwell i.e. ""gentleman explorers,"" adventure, exploration, travel, vintage, natural materials (not plastic)
4. It had to be more beautiful, fun, and cool than any logo currently in the marketplace.
We eventually settled on a treasure coin because it communicated all the things we wanted our logo to communicate:
1. looks valuable
2. small enough to be discreet (size of US quarter) yet visible enough
3. made of metal so its hard to counterfeit
4. its fun and cool because the coin evokes pirates and sunken treasure
5. The aged effect of the coin fits with the overall Wellington & Cromwell theme
The logo runners up in order were a nude mermaid, a horned owl, and a mallard duck

The design process is a bit of a misnomer because it takes hundreds of hours of collaboration between designer, developer, and manufacturing to bring a Wellington & Cromwell bag to life.
If we gave our designer free reign, he would specify that Wellington & Cromwell bags be made of dragonhide and unicorn horns.  Its the developer that is responsible for making sure that a design can actually be made into a physical object while still fully capturing the essence of the designer's creativity.
The developer then works with manufacturing to ensure that the product can be made consistently and efficiently.
This entire process at Wellington & Cromwell took thousands of hours of collaboration.  We hope you agree that the end result was a success.

<p>Stikk is a unique double sided thick core gel pad that will stick anything to everything! One single Stikk pad can safely hold any object up-to 350g (12.5oz), want to hold heavier items? Just use more Stikk Pads!</p>
<p>We found that finding ways of temporarily sticking objects to one another or other surfaces was an expensive and frustrating process and for the most part, the options were non-reusable, non-practical, looked bad and felt poor in quality or were simply not effective. </p>
<p>So thats when it occurred, what we needed was a thin and re-useable small pad that will stick to a huge range of objects, materials and surfaces, without being expensive or ugly, and so Stikk was born. </p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Stikk Gel Pad"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/370/024/5cb03e648aad4096f01e5ab9a0c685a5_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455637203&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=b5a970c921eec71c9a1ea59bf14d2f4f"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption><b>Stikk Gel Pad</b></figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>What we created in Stikk was the ultimate tool in sticking any small items to almost any surface. Stikk measures 7.6cm x 6.2cm x 0.3cm (3 Inches x 2.5 Inches x 0.1 Inches). Stikk is made from our own recipe of injection moulded Poly AB glue Plastic to create a material which is strong, flexible, sticky and re-usable, without being too hard, gluey or too soft like other similar products often are. Stikk can be pulled out to three to four times its size and it will return to its original size every-time. </p>
<p>After several months of testing we came across a recipe that was the best all rounder. We found favouring some quantities against others did produce either a more durable but less sticky pad, or even a far stronger and sticky pad but far less durable and would last fewer uses. We found the best middle ground, a strong, durable, sticky pad that wasn't too much or too little of anything and was just right for everyday use! </p>
<p>Stikk is very durable and can be cut into smaller pieces to create smaller gel pads for your smaller sticky needs!</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Cut Stikk Into Smaller Pieces"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/370/039/97cc1903d7159e71035984c6b14095f1_original.JPG?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455637355&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=19820c1d43a78eb077a10114885ebaeb"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Cut Stikk Into Smaller Pieces</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<h1>How Stikk Works - The Special Stikk Recipe Explained:</h1>
<p>Our unique recipe for Stikk involves a simple yet delicate process. The Stikk gel pad is classed as a Polyurethane Gel Elastomer. There are 5 distinct aspects when creating the recipe for Stikk that we had to test in different variables to arrive at the recipe we now have. They are: the Prepolymer material (the 'A' side) and what is called the Curative (the 'B' side) hence the A B glue recipe we mentioned earlier. The prepolymer consists of an isocyanate (or an NCO) that reacts with the hydroxyl (OH) in the curative, which creates the adhesive qualities. The final three aspects and variables are: component temperature, substrate temperature (temperature of the mixture) and post-curing temperature. All the five processes and variables, were tested in as many combinations as we could, to find the best all round gel pad recipe for Stikk. It is a particular combination of all five of those aspects that create Stikk. By applying particular quantities of the prepolymer and the curative at varying temperatures, we found many different styles of adhesive could be made, and so, this is how we eventually came across the recipe for Stikk. </p>
<h1>How Can You Use Stikk?</h1>
<p>The great thing about Stikk is that you can use it to do almost anything. Stikk can help you in almost every area of your life. Keeping tidy at the office or at work, keeping objects sturdy in your car, holding your phone or tablet on a surface at home to watch a movie or use as a smart home hub, a key holder on your wall, the list is endless. But, to get you started here is some inspiration:</p>
<p>Sticking your phone to the outside of the shower to watch the news.</p>
<p>Office wall storage</p>
<p>Watching movies in the bath tub</p>
<p>Correcting paintings and wall hangings</p>
<p>Keeping rugs stable</p>
<p>Car phone holder</p>
<p>Can be cut to make smaller</p>
<p>Stick keys or cards or anything else to your phone</p>
<p>Attaching your phone or tablet to any surface to use a screen or face time at eye level.</p>
<p>Use Stikk to hold your cookbooks, smart tablet, or phones while cooking</p>
<p>Stick office equipment to your wall</p>
<p>Back seat screens for your passengers. </p>
<p>A way to charge a phone when there is no surface area to hold it.</p>

<p>Stick things to your wall and don't leave any damage!</p>
<p>That doesn't even scratch the surface! The possibilities are endless! How will you use Stikk to transform your life? </p>
<h1>Using Stikk</h1>
<p>Stikk is an all round great product for solving many everyday issues. Its also incredibly durable and will not damage your wall or car dash board! But as with most products, Stikk does have its limitations and we will explain these and tips on how you can avoid damaging your Stikk or objects and surfaces you use to Stikk with.</p>
<h1>Sticking &amp; Removing Stikk from an object or Surface</h1>
<p> To avoid damage to the object and surface that you are sticking to, and to make sure your Stikk pad lasts a long time, we advise using a Twist Then Pull method, as seen in our video. This will reduce the chances of the unlikely event your Stikk pad may damage a surface, object or itself.</p>
<h1>Temperature</h1>
<p>Stikk works great in almost all temperates, high or low without changing the way it sticks. We do however advise that you reduce usage in extreme temperatures either low or high. For example we would advise that you DO NOT use stick in temperatures bellow -16C (0F) or above 62C (150F). What this means is that Stikk will work in your hot car out in the sun in MOST PLACES in the world and will work outdoors in the cold in MOST cold places. But we advise you use caution in extreme temperatures. Stikk will not melt in high temperatures, but its effectiveness may change.</p>
<h1>Weight </h1>
<p>While Stikk is very strong and very durable, we advise caution when using stick. You must use common sense. If you are wanting to stick an iPad or Tablet to a wall for example to watch a film, 1 Stikk pad should hold up with no issues. But using two Stikk pads will ensure security and strength. Environmental situations can play a part in the effectiveness of a Stikk pad. If you live in a hot humid place for example, the surface may be more moist than you think, which will reduce the power of Stikk, so we would advise using two pads, especially on a larger object.    </p>
<h1>Surfaces</h1>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the smoother and shinier the surface, the better Stikk with hold. Stikk can be very strong on some surfaces while on others it can be very weak, again we advise you use common sense to avoid injury and damage to the objects and surfaces on which you want to hold. </p>
<h1>Cleaning</h1>
<p> The great thing about Stikk is that it is re-useable. But evertime Stikk is removed and re-used it can lose its stickiness and get dirty as dust, dirt and other contaminants get stuck to it. But all you have to do to get your Stikk Gel pad back to its glory is rinse it under warm water. Just run some warm water and hold the Stikk pad under the stream while lightly massaging it, this will help remove and stubborn dirt and dust. Then, once clean, simply leave to air dry on the top of the tap. We suggest not using a towel or drying the washed Stikk pad in anyway other than air drying, to make sure that it regains its strength.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/370/167/fb910f80aa509521d5b7a696e9de03af_original.JPG?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455638633&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=303ff1bbf51e6f0d2a25cc71c80ba8c2"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>We stress that unless Stikk is washed regularly after being removed from surfaces, Stikk will eventually lose its sticky characteristics due to dust and dirt build up. To avoid this, be sure to wash your Stikk pad(s) regularly to avoid damage and ensure a long life. We also stress that although Stikk can safely hold 350g objects, these figures are found in ideal household conditions. If you are using expensive items, we suggest using two or more Stikk pads, just incase the surface you are sticking to is less than ideal, this will help to reduce the risk of the unlikely occurrence of Stikk coming loose. </p>
<p>Should you have any issues or concerns after receiving your Stikk pad, we will be happy to hear them, to both, make sure you have a perfect experience using Stikk and so that we can work on any and all short comings (not that there are any ;) that we may have missed during the testing process for our recipe. We are confident that you will all have a great experience with Stikk, but we are here to help should any issues arise. </p>

</div><p></p><h3><br/></h3></div>","Stikk is a Unique Double Sided Gel Pad That Will Stick Anything to Everything! Stikk can be washed and Re-Used over 200 times! And it won't damage the surface you stick to! Our custom Gel recipe Makes Stikk the best all round Gel Adhesive pad on the market! Strong, sticky, durable, massively re-usable and washable, Stikk will change the way to store and stick everyday items! Facebook  - https://www.facebook.com/stikkgelpadWebpage - http://www.stikkgel.com 


Stikk Gel Pad
Stikk is a unique double sided thick core gel pad that will stick anything to everything! One single Stikk pad can safely hold any object up-to 350g (12.5oz), want to hold heavier items? Just use more Stikk Pads!
We found that finding ways of temporarily sticking objects to one another or other surfaces was an expensive and frustrating process and for the most part, the options were non-reusable, non-practical, looked bad and felt poor in quality or were simply not effective. 
So thats when it occurred, what we needed was a thin and re-useable small pad that will stick to a huge range of objects, materials and surfaces, without being expensive or ugly, and so Stikk was born. 

Stikk Gel Pad
What we created in Stikk was the ultimate tool in sticking any small items to almost any surface. Stikk measures 7.6cm x 6.2cm x 0.3cm (3 Inches x 2.5 Inches x 0.1 Inches). Stikk is made from our own recipe of injection moulded Poly AB glue Plastic to create a material which is strong, flexible, sticky and re-usable, without being too hard, gluey or too soft like other similar products often are. Stikk can be pulled out to three to four times its size and it will return to its original size every-time. 
After several months of testing we came across a recipe that was the best all rounder. We found favouring some quantities against others did produce either a more durable but less sticky pad, or even a far stronger and sticky pad but far less durable and would last fewer uses. We found the best middle ground, a strong, durable, sticky pad that wasn't too much or too little of anything and was just right for everyday use! 
Stikk is very durable and can be cut into smaller pieces to create smaller gel pads for your smaller sticky needs!

Cut Stikk Into Smaller Pieces
How Stikk Works - The Special Stikk Recipe Explained:
Our unique recipe for Stikk involves a simple yet delicate process. The Stikk gel pad is classed as a Polyurethane Gel Elastomer. There are 5 distinct aspects when creating the recipe for Stikk that we had to test in different variables to arrive at the recipe we now have. They are: the Prepolymer material (the 'A' side) and what is called the Curative (the 'B' side) hence the A B glue recipe we mentioned earlier. The prepolymer consists of an isocyanate (or an NCO) that reacts with the hydroxyl (OH) in the curative, which creates the adhesive qualities. The final three aspects and variables are: component temperature, substrate temperature (temperature of the mixture) and post-curing temperature. All the five processes and variables, were tested in as many combinations as we could, to find the best all round gel pad recipe for Stikk. It is a particular combination of all five of those aspects that create Stikk. By applying particular quantities of the prepolymer and the curative at varying temperatures, we found many different styles of adhesive could be made, and so, this is how we eventually came across the recipe for Stikk. 
How Can You Use Stikk?
The great thing about Stikk is that you can use it to do almost anything. Stikk can help you in almost every area of your life. Keeping tidy at the office or at work, keeping objects sturdy in your car, holding your phone or tablet on a surface at home to watch a movie or use as a smart home hub, a key holder on your wall, the list is endless.

<p> <b><i>Who the heck are we??</i></b></p>
<p>Frankie's Box is an original subscription box based out of Los Angeles, that strives to give personal, handpicked, secondhand clothing to customers who focus on trend and recycled alternatives. The online brand is a combination of a service, product, and a retailer. It is a thrifted, environmentally friendly, recycled, customized clothing box. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Where did you come up with this brilliant idea??</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Fully Thrifted"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/524/874/cac177d9ff29227421dcffbd9e4cdf5a_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1464216950&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=bfc5a3648e2967775e0cfe650c99873c"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Fully Thrifted</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>Frankie's Box is loyal to being environmentally sustainable. From the merchandise to the box itself, the company promotes reused clothing and saving the environment. According to Marketing Charts, 83% of consumers say that it is important that companies implement programs to improve the environment. Not only this, but 83% of consumers believe that manufacturers using recycled packaging and producing energy efficient products have a positive impact on the environment. This being said, Frankie's Box will attract the eyes of 83% of consumers. The future potential of this company can only increase. People aren’t going to lose interest in the environment, they are only going to grow more involved in helping it piece itself back together. </p>
<p><b><i>The Process...</i></b></p>
<p>Once you sign up for the clothing box online, you are immediately asked to fill in a few questions that lead one of our personal stylists to your exact style. Not only this, but the customer will be able to pick out a category of style from the different images of outfits that are displayed on the website.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/524/560/9caffd37cdb701348be165666ca2dfc0_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1464215304&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=a486180680c1fd02eeb662b46b8e5da5"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p> After this process, a personal stylist will pick out 5 items from our thrifted collection that best fit the customer's style, and then ship them off. Each of the clothing items are affordable even with the 50% mark up from the original thrift store price. </p>

<p><i><b>A few things you should know about us that makes us a hot shot:</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>We are the first re-used clothing box</li>
<li>Our stylists physically go to the thrift stores to hand pick a large collection of trending items that will be used for our customers box</li>
<li> The subscription is an option, you can either commit to monthly subscriptions, or a one time option.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

Frankie's Box is an original subscription box based out of Los Angeles, that strives to give personal, handpicked, secondhand clothing to customers who focus on trend and recycled alternatives. The online brand is a combination of a service, product, and a retailer. It is a thrifted, environmentally friendly, recycled, customized clothing box. 

Where did you come up with this brilliant idea??


Fully Thrifted
Frankie's Box is loyal to being environmentally sustainable. From the merchandise to the box itself, the company promotes reused clothing and saving the environment. According to Marketing Charts, 83% of consumers say that it is important that companies implement programs to improve the environment. Not only this, but 83% of consumers believe that manufacturers using recycled packaging and producing energy efficient products have a positive impact on the environment. This being said, Frankie's Box will attract the eyes of 83% of consumers. The future potential of this company can only increase. People aren’t going to lose interest in the environment, they are only going to grow more involved in helping it piece itself back together. 
The Process...
Once you sign up for the clothing box online, you are immediately asked to fill in a few questions that lead one of our personal stylists to your exact style. Not only this, but the customer will be able to pick out a category of style from the different images of outfits that are displayed on the website.


 After this process, a personal stylist will pick out 5 items from our thrifted collection that best fit the customer's style, and then ship them off. Each of the clothing items are affordable even with the 50% mark up from the original thrift store price. 

Fully Thrifted
A few things you should know about us that makes us a hot shot:

We are the first re-used clothing box
Our stylists physically go to the thrift stores to hand pick a large collection of trending items that will be used for our customers box
 The subscription is an option, you can either commit to monthly subscriptions, or a one time option.


Fully Thrifted
 Another part of our process is that the customer will pay a $30.00 styling fee when they first order the box, this is to make sure we earn profit. This fee cancels out if the customer makes a purchase. Once they receive their box, they have 3 days to either return the items they don’t want to keep, purchase certain items or all of the items in the box, and if they fail to do so, they will be charged the full total of the merchandise in the box. They are given a return label, which makes this as easy as possible for them. If items are returned, we will reuse those items for a different box that matches another customer's style.

<p><b>Aerogram is a new brand based in Milan</b> with a mission to pursue refined craftsmanship.</p>
<p><b>We haven’t reinvented anything.</b> We’re just going back to basics. Handpicking natural materials that feel great and last a lifetime. We have gathered together an elite selection of artisans blessed with skill and passion. We bring these elements together with timeless, functional designs for a life well-lived on the move.</p>
<p><b>This is a flexible funding campaign.</b> We guarantee the production of all the orders made during the course of this campaign, regardless of the end result.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473082440/Black3_liktyc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>The most beautiful things in life are also the most natural.</b> Why should leather be any different?</p>
<p><b>We went to Tuscany to handpick two types of totally unprocessed leather.</b> No chemicals, no chrome, no plastic coating, no spray-painting, no printing whatsoever. Just beautiful leather made completely respecting the traditions of the artisans of time gone by, using only botanic tannins for <b>the most natural feeling ever.</b></p>
<p><b>Then we gathered together a unique collective of our fellow artisans in Milan</b> to remind the world why Italians do it better.</p>
<p><b>The result is the ‘The Black Collection’.</b> Five timeless pieces built to last a lifetime. Handmade in Italy to the highest quality standards, respecting the tradition of real Italian artisans. <b>Ideal for a life well-lived on the move.</b></p>
<hr/>
<p>As a result of the organic nature of our leather, <b>no two products can ever be the same.</b> The leather is dry-spun in wooden tanning drums to make it shrink and create an extremely irregular grain, leaving it unique and natural to the touch. You will realise this as soon as hold it in your hand. <b>Each piece is truly one of a kind.</b></p>

<p>Our team has lots of experience in the production of high-quality artisanal products. We have a close working relationship with the producers of the leather as well as the artisans who create our products. The production is carried out here in Milan. The artisans are located nearby our studios. This allows us to work closely with them and quickly overcome any problems that may arise. </p></div>","Aerogram is a new brand based in Milan with a mission to pursue refined craftsmanship.
We haven’t reinvented anything. We’re just going back to basics. Handpicking natural materials that feel great and last a lifetime. We have gathered together an elite selection of artisans blessed with skill and passion. We bring these elements together with timeless, functional designs for a life well-lived on the move.
This is a flexible funding campaign. We guarantee the production of all the orders made during the course of this campaign, regardless of the end result.



The most beautiful things in life are also the most natural. Why should leather be any different?
We went to Tuscany to handpick two types of totally unprocessed leather. No chemicals, no chrome, no plastic coating, no spray-painting, no printing whatsoever. Just beautiful leather made completely respecting the traditions of the artisans of time gone by, using only botanic tannins for the most natural feeling ever.
Then we gathered together a unique collective of our fellow artisans in Milan to remind the world why Italians do it better.
The result is the ‘The Black Collection’. Five timeless pieces built to last a lifetime. Handmade in Italy to the highest quality standards, respecting the tradition of real Italian artisans. Ideal for a life well-lived on the move.

As a result of the organic nature of our leather, no two products can ever be the same. The leather is dry-spun in wooden tanning drums to make it shrink and create an extremely irregular grain, leaving it unique and natural to the touch. You will realise this as soon as hold it in your hand. Each piece is truly one of a kind.

I feel a passionate desire to share my views with the world, to show them life through my eyes, a life which so inspires me to create.

I can share it and put that beauty on display for people everywhere to enjoy. </span><br/></p><p><span>It's more than just photographing what I see. It's bringing my creative visions to life. It's documenting the wonderful happenings of the world. I find beauty in everything around me, from the flowers to the insects that crawl upon them. There's beauty in the earth and in the sky above us. Beauty is in the forests, the oceans, and the urban city. Beauty is people and all the glorious things that make us unique. <br/><br/>Art is my passion and I feel it is my duty to share it with you.

Given the opportunity, we can help make the world a brighter place.<br/></span></p><p><span>Project description:</span></p><p><span></span></p><p>My goal is to run a fully functioning photography and graphic design business. I want to be able to give life to my ideas, while also offering low-cost,  professional services. I want to be able to give people opportunities and benefits that might normally be  out of their price range. Once my business has enough profits and exposure, I plan to open a line of custom apparel and accessories. I dream of sharing my creations with people in a fun and useful way. My custom designs will be printed on a variety of clothing and accessories, ranging from T-shirts, to hats, to phone cases and more. I will also  be selling prints of most original art pieces, with various sizes available to purchase. </p>
<p>I believe that businesses should be for the people, not for personal gain or greed. With an investment, I will be able to purchase all the equipment necessary to offer the public a professional and,  more importantly, affordable experience. With wages so low and the cost of living so high, I want people to know they can still afford to have the nice things they've always wanted. I'll be able to give a single mother beautiful portraits of her newborn baby without having to worry about cost. I can offer children functional and fashionable clothing, with allowance money left over. I can give people the products and services they deserve, and they can help support local artists and businesses. </p>
<p>Artistry is about more than the singular - it's about an entire community. I'm proud to say that I am a part of a much larger, much more diverse community of talented artists, gifted in their trades and talents. Community means helping and supporting one another. Once my business is making profits, I plan to give back to my fellow artists and community members by donating time and money to help those in need. </p>
<p>Your investment will provide me with the tools and equipment I need to be able to offer material happiness to the wonderful people in our worldwide  community.</p>
<p>Risks and Challenges:</p>

I've always viewed the world in a creative light, stretching my imagination beyond the limits of reality. I feel a passionate desire to share my views with the world, to show them life through my eyes, a life which so inspires me to create. Through Photography and Graphic design, I can permanently capture the beauty of the world around me and cherish it for years to come. I can share it and put that beauty on display for people everywhere to enjoy. It's more than just photographing what I see. It's bringing my creative visions to life. It's documenting the wonderful happenings of the world. I find beauty in everything around me, from the flowers to the insects that crawl upon them. There's beauty in the earth and in the sky above us. Beauty is in the forests, the oceans, and the urban city. Beauty is people and all the glorious things that make us unique. Art is my passion and I feel it is my duty to share it with you. Through my camera lens, I can capture and express the charm and the elegance of people and things everywhere. Given the opportunity, we can help make the world a brighter place.Project description:My goal is to run a fully functioning photography and graphic design business. I want to be able to give life to my ideas, while also offering low-cost,  professional services. I want to be able to give people opportunities and benefits that might normally be  out of their price range. Once my business has enough profits and exposure, I plan to open a line of custom apparel and accessories. I dream of sharing my creations with people in a fun and useful way. My custom designs will be printed on a variety of clothing and accessories, ranging from T-shirts, to hats, to phone cases and more. I will also  be selling prints of most original art pieces, with various sizes available to purchase. 
I believe that businesses should be for the people, not for personal gain or greed. With an investment, I will be able to purchase all the equipment necessary to offer the public a professional and,  more importantly, affordable experience. With wages so low and the cost of living so high, I want people to know they can still afford to have the nice things they've always wanted. I'll be able to give a single mother beautiful portraits of her newborn baby without having to worry about cost. I can offer children functional and fashionable clothing, with allowance money left over. I can give people the products and services they deserve, and they can help support local artists and businesses. 
Artistry is about more than the singular - it's about an entire community. I'm proud to say that I am a part of a much larger, much more diverse community of talented artists, gifted in their trades and talents. Community means helping and supporting one another. Once my business is making profits, I plan to give back to my fellow artists and community members by donating time and money to help those in need. 
Your investment will provide me with the tools and equipment I need to be able to offer material happiness to the wonderful people in our worldwide  community.
Risks and Challenges:
Challenges I could face with this project are: Delay in manufacturing the products, Shipping mishaps, Getting new products into stores for resale, Advertisement and awareness of my business and products. To keep these things from ever being a problem or threat to the business I have put many things in order and on stand by already. 
Delay in manufacturing, can simply be avoided by making sure everything is thoroughly gone through, revised and having all design material in order, Along with good communication skills between myself and the manufacturer.
Shipping mishaps, Can be avoided by simply taking the time to make sure every clients information is correct and keeping clear records of that for such purposes, along with never rushing an order. Always plan ahead and make sure everything is done on time if not in advance.

  Thanks for checking out Connect One Threads. We started this journey in 2011,
  starting with a final thesis on the sustainability of the clothing supply chain. 
  It evolved into a travel adventure across the US, Europe, and Turkey where we met
  some and learned from the sustainable fashion movement. It’s been a beautiful
  journey so far, thanks to the support of so many who believe in what we’re doing,
  and at the end of the day, we realized this isn’t just for fashion. This is a way
  for us to come together as a global community.

<p>If you are searching for a high quality timepiece that is able to adapt on many occasions of your life (whatever it is: school, job, dinner, gala, party...) THIS IS YOUR NEXT WATCH. We believe that a high quality timepiece including a swiss made movement don't has to break your bank. Further we wanted to combine our highest quality standard with the ability to design your time.</p>
<p>Our straps for the COMITARI watch are so easy to change, that you will love to switch them even during the day and adapt to your current outfit. For those of you that want a timepiece that separates from all the others (especially in quality) consider also our already configured ARDORI.</p>
<p>This will be the first fashion watch, with such a high quality state that you will give it from one generation to the next one.</p>
<p>We want to be the authority in individualization, most important in straps. Therefore we want to supply you with straps that are NOT on the market or very RARE to find (on very expensive watches e.g.). Read below what we would love to do next...(future ideas).</p>

In hospitals it pays for itself very quickly by eliminating the time it takes to tie knots in bags, and avoiding the clean-up left behind from bags that didn't stay in place.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you've ever had that problem at home, you love this. It's perfect for your kitchen, bathroom, or anywhere you use trash bags.</span></p>
<p>Now, for home use, we tackled the other problem associated with trash by incorporating a replaceable scented disc into the design to freshen the air around the trash can too. We call it the<a href=""http://www.cinch2.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Scented Cinch</a>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you like the idea, please back our project.

<p><b>Original Cinch</b></p>
<p>I invented the <a href=""http://www.trashbagcinch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Original Version</a> because a friend was fed up with the latest mess left behind in their garbage can from the trash bag slipping in. She solicited my help knowing I had a knack to fix problems like this. I showed her how I dealt with the problem while telling her about my days in high school working as a janitor. I explained that we were trained to tie knots in the top edge of the bag to make it smaller, and then stretch it over the rim. I had done this literally hundreds of times every day that I worked - so I got pretty proficient at it.    </p>
<p>The problem was my friend could not quite get it right (she did not have the extensive experience I did from doing it thousands of times - lucky her). She either made the bag too big or too small and just ended up more frustrated wasting more time. That's when it hit me - make something that ""cinches"" it up tight around the rim of the can for them! And the original Cinch was born...</p>

<p><b>New Scented Cinch</b></p>
<p>I've been selling <a href=""http://www.trashbagcinch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the original Trash Bag Cinch</a> for several years in the Janitorial Supplies markets mostly through industrial supply distributors. </p>
<p>Many people I knew wanted them for their homes too, and we decided to improve it further by incorporating a replaceable Scented Disc to freshen the air around the trash too. We tested many fragrances (some of which we will release in the future). </p>
<p>A Fresh Lemon scent quickly became the favorite because of its natural odor neutralizing properties, and the need for it the kitchen where we often have guests.</p>
<p>Since we started developing the scented version, many trash bag manufactures have come out with more expensive scented bags, and even ones that claim to ""cling"" to the rim. The problem with them is that you still need a trash can that the bag fits pretty closely. Plus the the drawstring that ""stretches"" doesn't draw closed as well.</p>
<p>Save your money. <a href=""http://www.cinch2.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Scented Trash Bag Cinch</a> allows you to use any trash bag you'd like, keeps it from falling into any can, and freshens the air around the garbage storage.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><b>Product Testing</b></p>
<p>We did extensive functionality and fragrance testing. When we felt we had it right, we utilized the Cooking Club of America to test it and we received top ratings.</p>

</div></div>","Product Background Hello,
My name is Mike Kasbohm, thanks for taking a moment to consider my campaign! 
The Scented Cinch is a simple but effective solution to an aggravating and messy problem most of us face everyday. We've actually been selling the original version of it for industrial use for several years where it's been widely accepted as the fastest, most effective way to keep a trash liner from falling into the can. In hospitals it pays for itself very quickly by eliminating the time it takes to tie knots in bags, and avoiding the clean-up left behind from bags that didn't stay in place.
If you've ever had that problem at home, you love this. It's perfect for your kitchen, bathroom, or anywhere you use trash bags.
Now, for home use, we tackled the other problem associated with trash by incorporating a replaceable scented disc into the design to freshen the air around the trash can too. We call it the Scented Cinch.
If you like the idea, please back our project. You'll get a couple for yourself, and maybe you can use some of the original Cinches at your workplace too. Pass this campaign information along to your friends and family, they'll thank you for saving them from the mess and hassle from trash bags that don't stay in place. 
A successful campaign would help us to keep our entrepreneurial dreams alive, and make the years of overcoming the many hurdles all worth it. More on that below.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration!
Mike 
Original Cinch
I invented the Original Version because a friend was fed up with the latest mess left behind in their garbage can from the trash bag slipping in. She solicited my help knowing I had a knack to fix problems like this. I showed her how I dealt with the problem while telling her about my days in high school working as a janitor. I explained that we were trained to tie knots in the top edge of the bag to make it smaller, and then stretch it over the rim. I had done this literally hundreds of times every day that I worked - so I got pretty proficient at it.    
The problem was my friend could not quite get it right (she did not have the extensive experience I did from doing it thousands of times - lucky her). She either made the bag too big or too small and just ended up more frustrated wasting more time. That's when it hit me - make something that ""cinches"" it up tight around the rim of the can for them! And the original Cinch was born...

New Scented Cinch
I've been selling the original Trash Bag Cinch for several years in the Janitorial Supplies markets mostly through industrial supply distributors. 
Many people I knew wanted them for their homes too, and we decided to improve it further by incorporating a replaceable Scented Disc to freshen the air around the trash too. We tested many fragrances (some of which we will release in the future). 
A Fresh Lemon scent quickly became the favorite because of its natural odor neutralizing properties, and the need for it the kitchen where we often have guests.
Since we started developing the scented version, many trash bag manufactures have come out with more expensive scented bags, and even ones that claim to ""cling"" to the rim. The problem with them is that you still need a trash can that the bag fits pretty closely. Plus the the drawstring that ""stretches"" doesn't draw closed as well.
Save your money. The Scented Trash Bag Cinch allows you to use any trash bag you'd like, keeps it from falling into any can, and freshens the air around the garbage storage.   
Product Testing
We did extensive functionality and fragrance testing. When we felt we had it right, we utilized the Cooking Club of America to test it and we received top ratings.
You can read some of the reviews here.   What We'll Do With the Funds & What You Get We have already completed our high capacity production tooling needed to manufacture the parts right here in Minneapolis, MN. We need the funds to enable us order enough inventory to manufacture at a scale that affords a reasonable cost of goods. With a successful campaign we'll have the jump-start we need to scale production to the point that we can begin the necessary retail packaging too and selling at the retail level.
All orders (even if we don't meet our goal that allows us to scale enough to complete the retail packaging), will be fulfilled shortly after the campaign with completed production parts (in generic packaging suitable for shipping), 
We offer a number of Perks. You can get the first Scented Cinches that will be available for shipping (in April!). You can also get a free one by being one of the first 100 to select the (25) original Cinch perk. Make sure to check out the significant savings!

Risks & Challenges
 The risks at this point are minimal as we have become proficient at product development over the years, and we have great relationships with our component vendors. The challenge however will be spreading the word on this. Let's face it, garbage isn't glamorous. It's not the next great electronic gizmo - but, it does solve a common problem. We think you'l love it, and we are going to need your help spreading the word.   
    Other Ways You Can Help If you just can't contribute, we sure could use your help - Please:  help us get the word out and make some noise about the Scented Cinch. Remember to  use your Indiegogo share tools!   Remember: Just Pinch-it and Cinch-it!My BackgroundI'm an inventor and small business owner. I love creating simple solutions to everyday problems.

<p><strong>What will the money be used for?  </strong>Inventory and spreading the word.  Although we know we have made a world-class product, we need help re-stocking our inventory.  We also have to introduce the world to this brand new category of sex toy, unlike anything else on the market. We hope to spread the word organically but we will also be undertaking a few seperate marketing strategies.  The bottom line is we want everyone to have the opportunity to Go-Go...</p>
<p><strong>How large is the Go-Go Glider?</strong> The entire product is 19.5 inches but the insertable portion is only about 6.5 inches, an average size for a sex toy. Most of the product consists of the handles and the glider pole which is the innovation behind the patent-pending <strong>double thrust design</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>What did the lucky testers think? </strong>One tester simply said ""where have you been all my life?"" Another described the Go-Go Glider as ""an internal massage for my G-spot""! Yet another tester just responded ""Wow, Wow, Wow!"" We heard two very encouraging stories, the first being a woman in her 40s who claims to have never had an orgasm masturbating took our ""solo play"" challenge and using the Go-Go Glider and a hand held vibe reached orgasm in under a minute! Another tester told us she infrequently had orgasms but had orgasms on five consecutive attempts when she and her partner used the Go-Go Glider (she was not happy when it was time to return the test model). Finally, one lady told us she could not figure out the simultaneous ""coming and going"" feeling but all she knew is she never wanted it to stop!</p>
<p><strong>Can the Go-Go Glider be used for solo play? </strong>Interestingly enough the overwhelming answer to that question is ""yes"".  Although the Go-Go Glider was originally designed with only couple use in mind, what we have learned in testing is a woman holding just the slider grip can easily use the product for solo play.  What happens is the tip is vaginally inserted along with the slider but when the slider is pulled out, the kegal muscles hold onto the tip.  The back and forth G-Spot stimulation along with the use of the kegal muscles enhances sensation and increases orgasmic intensity.</p>
<p><strong>Can the Go-Go Glider be used with a vibrator? </strong>Absolutely.  That is one of the most thoughtful features of the design.  Since the servicing partner is operating both the tip and slider with the two handles, the receiving partner has both of her hands free to grab her favorite vibe and enjoy. Since solo play can be one handed, a favorite hand-vibe can also be used alone with the Go-Go Glider.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Go-Go Glider patented?  </strong>Yes, we are patent-pending in the U.S., Canada, and 39 European countries; we have also trademarked our name. </p>
<p><strong>Can lubricant be used with the Go-Go Glider? </strong>Of course, a water based lubricant can be used (and is encouraged).  Note, a silicone based lubricant will break down the silicone glider and therefore is not recommended.</p>

Yet another tester just responded ""Wow, Wow, Wow!"" We heard two very encouraging stories, the first being a woman in her 40s who claims to have never had an orgasm masturbating took our ""solo play"" challenge and using the Go-Go Glider and a hand held vibe reached orgasm in under a minute! Another tester told us she infrequently had orgasms but had orgasms on five consecutive attempts when she and her partner used the Go-Go Glider (she was not happy when it was time to return the test model). Finally, one lady told us she could not figure out the simultaneous ""coming and going"" feeling but all she knew is she never wanted it to stop!
Can the Go-Go Glider be used for solo play? Interestingly enough the overwhelming answer to that question is ""yes"".  Although the Go-Go Glider was originally designed with only couple use in mind, what we have learned in testing is a woman holding just the slider grip can easily use the product for solo play.  What happens is the tip is vaginally inserted along with the slider but when the slider is pulled out, the kegal muscles hold onto the tip.  The back and forth G-Spot stimulation along with the use of the kegal muscles enhances sensation and increases orgasmic intensity.
Can the Go-Go Glider be used with a vibrator? Absolutely.  That is one of the most thoughtful features of the design.  Since the servicing partner is operating both the tip and slider with the two handles, the receiving partner has both of her hands free to grab her favorite vibe and enjoy. Since solo play can be one handed, a favorite hand-vibe can also be used alone with the Go-Go Glider.
Is the Go-Go Glider patented?  Yes, we are patent-pending in the U.S., Canada, and 39 European countries; we have also trademarked our name. 
Can lubricant be used with the Go-Go Glider? Of course, a water based lubricant can be used (and is encouraged).  Note, a silicone based lubricant will break down the silicone glider and therefore is not recommended.",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a small team of passionate horse people who want to democratize the way we buy clothes and equipment. We bring a diverse background of business acumen from time spent in Silicon Valley and community knowledge from work in 4-H, Cavalia, A-Circuit Shows and Therapeutic Riding Programs.</p>
<p>This service is incredibly near and dear to our hearts as we know it makes an impact on riders lives each and every day. To save an extra $50 or $100 on purchasing items you need to ride can make a difference in paying for all of the other services to support a horse. To be able to sell the things laying around your barn can give you the budget for an extra show or trailer ride. To receive an item we have donated to our 4-H and Pony Club partners can make a big difference in a child being able to enjoy their horse.</p>
<p>Our campaign is focused on allowing us to catch up on the demand for our kits to clean out items to sell as we currently have a waiting list of over 250 people that we just can't afford to pay the return shipping to receive their bags. We also want to reach as many people as possible nationwide to let them know that this is an option now - you can choose to save money.</p>
<p>Your contributions will allow you access to discounts, personal shopping services, free shipping and joining a community of people who truly believe in the power of riders helping other riders.</p>
<p>Achieving our capital goal will allow us to meet the demand for our service and help as many riders as possible at the speed we would like to with a more robust team. It would also allow us to build more communication tools for all of our customers so they have a better experience consigning and shopping with us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to raise a total of $50,000 to achieve ALL of our goals for 2019. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the total would go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10,000: Catch up on all clean out kit mailing, processing and product onboarding to the website. Extra budget to keep up with additional kit growth throughout 2019 (15% growth M/M) and to donate rejected items to more partners in need.</li>
<li>$25,000 Solidify current team with increased hours, add a bookkeeper to speed up consignment payments and hire an hourly extra person to speed up customer service, order shipment and item processing.</li>
<li>$15,000 Build a customer log in system that provides:<ul>
<li>Consignment Customers: A visual detail page with all accepted items, status and payout information </li>
<li>Sales Customers: A ""Favorites"" section, personal recommendations based on discipline and your size, price drop notifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can't offer a traditional stake in the company we see your contribution as a key to opening up benefits of a VIP customer. These can be anything from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Fun ""Boss Mare"" Tee  </li>
<li>A Set of Extra 20% Off Discounts</li>
<li>A Personal Shopper that Gives You First Dibs on Items Your Want As They Come In</li>
<li>An Extra 20% Off and Free Shipping For Life</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can't gather the total amount, we will still use the funds available to focus on servicing all the customers we currently have by keeping up with clean out kits, getting product up as quickly as we can, sending orders quickly and providing prompt customer service and communication.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow riders from all over the US (and one day beyond) the opportunity to enjoy their time with horses.</p>
<p>From expanding the number of people getting money back for the items they purchased and no longer need, to helping parent afford the first riding outfit for their child, to allowing an expanded list of our donation partners a steady flow of items to help. We even recycle all of our fabrics that we can't donate to keep fabric waste out of the landfill!</p>
<p>The more money we can raise to expand what we do, the more we can perpetuate a better option for all riders allowing them to choose secondhand first.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We face a number of risks and challenges on our way to bringing this service to a large audience but want to continue to focus on building trust with our customers, providing clear communication and speedy service.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do have some competitors or other general platforms that people list this type of merchandise on, but I have always felt that the more opportunities to buy and sell the better. All of the services differ in the type of items and how they work. People should be able to find what works best for them!</li>
<li>The more people we open this up to the more likely we may experience fraudulent behavior. We are trying to get ahead of this with fraud protect software on our orders and insuring our packages.</li>
<li>As we take on more and more items we need to scale all of our shipping systems. Once we reach a certain threshold of clean out kits sent in per week, we can get into a lower cost bulk shipping program.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word! If you can't contribute maybe someone you know can. Share our story and our page - we would be so grateful.</li>
<li>Find us an investor! We are still actively looking for an Angel or Seed investor who gets what we are doing. We have a much bigger story to tell and a lot of things to accomplish.</li>
</ul>

Back in the early mid-2000's, his mother couldn't afford designer clothing from the mall because she was a single mother and had to pay bills. Terrance used to get picked on for not having those types of clothes. We have a vision of where my brand will be one of the top brands of the world but affordable to people who lack finance.</p><p>There is a need for a service to come with a clothing line. There are many designer brands out there that multi-million dollars brands, however, they don't give back to people. We have a farmer mindset meaning we want to plant some crowns back into the community. Over time when a plant receives proper water, gardening and sunlight it will give you a large harvest from the care that is given. We look to service the needs of others by having a future washing service/dry cleaning service, having a high-quality product, and having it at an affordable price.</p><p><u><i><strong>GOALS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Kings)</strong></i></u></p><p>Ripe Brand Clothing needs $1,800 to get funded for our first Kingdom shirts. This order will take 30 days to mass produce overseas and orders will be fulfilled as soon as we receive the shipments.

</ul><p><u><i><strong>MARKET CHALLENGES </strong></i></u></p><p>The biggest challenge is building a brand from scratch and selling apparel solely online. The problem is people aren't going to know if the product is quality if it's just sold online. We also face possible production and shipping delays since our products are coming from overseas. The solution is we are going to have fashion shows in the local areas and across the state to get our name established through word of month.

(CATERING TO EVENT IN THE FUTURE AFTER THE CROWNING SHIRTS.)
OUR VISION Terrance Ramsey's passion for starting a clothing brand is he sees a strong need for a brand to serve the community not just to sell a quality product but also to provide a service to people who need to be catered to. Back in the early mid-2000's, his mother couldn't afford designer clothing from the mall because she was a single mother and had to pay bills. Terrance used to get picked on for not having those types of clothes. We have a vision of where my brand will be one of the top brands of the world but affordable to people who lack finance.There is a need for a service to come with a clothing line. There are many designer brands out there that multi-million dollars brands, however, they don't give back to people. We have a farmer mindset meaning we want to plant some crowns back into the community. Over time when a plant receives proper water, gardening and sunlight it will give you a large harvest from the care that is given. We look to service the needs of others by having a future washing service/dry cleaning service, having a high-quality product, and having it at an affordable price.GOALS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Kings)Ripe Brand Clothing needs $1,800 to get funded for our first Kingdom shirts. This order will take 30 days to mass produce overseas and orders will be fulfilled as soon as we receive the shipments. If you make a donation, you will get a shirt as well as a coupon code for a future purchase that never expires.  (This is continuation from foreign pineapple shocker). ($377raised)MORE BENEFITS
The Seed of Royalty is to sow a seed with us and we are going to bless you with a future coupon code that never expires and each supporter will receive a crowning shirt to say thank you.
Each supporter is going to have their picture taken and we are going to put them in our secret Google+ culture community to where people can share their testimonies about our product and communicate how special we made them feel. People may not remember what you have done for them, they will always remember how you made them feel.
We are going to crown our queens that supports and serves the community around them.    
MARKET CHALLENGES The biggest challenge is building a brand from scratch and selling apparel solely online. The problem is people aren't going to know if the product is quality if it's just sold online. We also face possible production and shipping delays since our products are coming from overseas. The solution is we are going to have fashion shows in the local areas and across the state to get our name established through word of month. We are going to be shipping through DHL for promptness for our supporters to get their product as well as return the product if it doesn't fit correctly or its the wrong size. All you pay is shipping for your shirt. WORD OF MOUTH GIFT Let's say that you're not able to donate any money. That is perfectly fine. We still will need your help. We need your help by spreading the word as well through social media. If someone donates money from your network we will give you a shirt as well to say thank you.

<p>Our <strong>True Exercise Shoes (TrExS) </strong>use an engineered hydraulic friction technology that works. It is embedded in the soles.  Hydraulic friction creates heat. To dissipate the heat the TrExS features transpiration panels and other means. TrExShoes feature adjustable workout effort (Workout Intensity), set at factory but changeable in store or by skilled customer having the tool. Instability, the principle of the discontinued ""Tone-Up"" shoes, has no place in what we do.</p>
<p>Appeal is to a) all civilians desiring trimness &amp; fitness, b) military &amp; security &amp; sport training.</p>
<p><strong>                  The Business</strong></p>
<p><strong>Licensing </strong>arrangements will be offered to a) shoe, and b) exercise equipment companies, globally.  To keep track of licensed product and work-in-progress (WIP), radio frequency identification  technology (RFID) supplied by us will be incorporated into every TrExShoe pair.   </p>
<p>                           <strong>The Funding</strong></p>
<p>The seed funds of $40K have been expended.  To create the long lasting prototypes and initial pre-production pairs, <strong>NOW</strong> we need <strong>$15,000 by your contributions</strong>.  With these funds in hand we will make prototypes and pre-production pairs.  With those we'll seek partners, licensees, investors, to create the first production batch and bring it to market.</p>
<p>                                    <strong>The Expectation</strong></p>
<p>Before being discontinued by dint of having been found to not work, the Instability based ""Tone-Up"" products were selling 20 Million pairs per year at ~$100 each a few years ago.   We can surpass the <strong>$2 Billion/yr</strong> retail business, and will do so by a strategy of licensing globally.</p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>We are a number of associated individuals led by Mr Harry Shamir, very experienced degreed professionals in Engineering, Polymer Chemistry, Medicine, Marketing, Legals, Government operations, and Management.</p>
<p>Mr Shamir is an M.E. (1967), with a Masters' in Engineering Management (1977), and 40 years' industry experience.</p>
<p><strong>            Our Story</strong></p>
<p>The concept behind TrExS was born before 2008 but took time to gel and overcome non working ideas (quite a few).   Eventually the pre-prototypes were created by modifying commercial sneakers, but their life in use was limited to 1/2 hour and was one time, but proved the principle.  In April 2016 we were issued a US Patent, and now need to create prototypes and a preproduction batch.  The prototypes will be used to convince partners, licensees, investors, that the technology works, by having test out TrExS on their own feet, one foot wearing TrEx, the other non-TrEx.  A 1/2 hour walk suffices.   To convince skeptics who have no opportunity to try the prototypes, we will invest $50K ASAP in an academic third party study similar to how the ""Tone-Up"" shoes were tested before discontinuance.</p>
<p><strong>                        What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our current need is $15K.  Prototypes will beget additional funding to create a first product batch, OR identify a first licensee.  For each $125 contribution, we promise a pair of TrExS to be retailed at $250, from first production batch.  Because your $125 is an investment of trust, not mere cold calculation, we will recognize the trust somehow, but appropriately, in addition to the TrExS pair.  Smaller contributions will receive discount certificates for TrExShoes.  We also hope to obtain testimonials from you with frank opinions of the TrExS product after wearing them.  With your permission we will publish them.</p>
<p><strong>                                    Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>This is a business venture.  All ventures entail risk.  The largest is from the technology being appropriated and copies sold.  To overcome crooks we shall employ at least one strategy and one tactic.  The tactic is to build into every pair an electronic RFID chip enabling identification of source and other data.  This will help identify copies since their chips won't have compatible readability, or have no chips at all.  The strategy is to license production and sales at many places globally, each licensee responsible to keep crooks in check.  This will also reduce shipping costs.</p>
<p>Our income will be assured by the licensee buying the RFID chips from us, as well as the key element transforming human energy to heat, located inside the sole.</p>
<p>Third party testing and validation of TrExS claims will be done ASAP, to preempt any false-claims suits.   We will also warn people who suffer foot pain upon walking uphill, to not use TrExS without Podiatrist approval.</p>
<p>Recycling is important for more than environmental concerns.  Used but still good TrExS can be transferred to needy people.  Unusable TrExS can become resources of usable materials.  We will do our level best to make that happen.</p>
<p>Of course the biggest risk is will it sell at the retail price offered?   We will not price the TrExS product out of reach, though first batches will inevitably have price tags higher than later batches.   </p>
<p>We are confident, but too experienced to not be clear eyed about the future.</p>

</div></div>","The Problem
Most people want weight loss and fitness gain by low effort, cost & time. The Military wants something effective to ready kids and recruits (some even still use unhealthy ankle weights). The $2B/yr civilian demand for the discontinued ""Tone Up"" shoes was real, and can be recovered and surpassed if given an exercise shoe-machine, that truly works.  TrExS works!!!
            The Solution

TrExShoes feature adjustable workout effort (Workout Intensity), set at factory but changeable in store or by skilled customer having the tool. Instability, the principle of the discontinued ""Tone-Up"" shoes, has no place in what we do.
Appeal is to a) all civilians desiring trimness & fitness, b) military & security & sport training.
                  The Business
Licensing arrangements will be offered to a) shoe, and b) exercise equipment companies, globally.  To keep track of licensed product and work-in-progress (WIP), radio frequency identification  technology (RFID) supplied by us will be incorporated into every TrExShoe pair.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is our 1st crowd funding project, for the product: We have spent nearly a year to improving and completing the design, several prototype tests and made many improvements to ensure the quality of the product. We have completed the mold and now ready for production. So that's really no risk of the products. And also to ensure the delivery on time, we have partner with an agency can handle goods from our factory direct to the destination through by “USPS” for USA market. It will take 3-15 business days depending on the shipping method.</p>
<p>We also accept international shipment, some countries may be slower but average will be same as above 3-15 business days.</p>

It will take 3-15 business days depending on the shipping method.
We also accept international shipment, some countries may be slower but average will be same as above 3-15 business days.
So the only risk you are taking is whether you like the product or not. I can tell you after I use CEP One I won’t tight my shoelace again!

If you are feeling adventurous and ready for a challenge, the Sunset collection is the one for you. The Dawn collection offers a light colour palette, like waking up right before sunrise on a cold winter morning and is the perfect choice for elegant and classy women.Aurora offers you a splash of daring red with dark and edgy colours. This collection is perfect for the fashion-forward and sensual. The colours in the Dusk collection present the partial darkness before nightfall - perfect for mysterious women on the search for their new adventure.You will be able to purchase additional straps on our website after the end of our Indiegogo campaign at a very affordable price. We want you to have the freedom to transform your watch at any given moment and match it to every situation.New straps will be added regularly so your Mossepic watch will be able to continue transforming constantly.  The idea behind the Mossepic Watch Collection developed because of the hectic world we live in that is constantly changing. If you want to keep up, you have to change with it and you have to change fast. We found it very hard to fit just one watch to our style, that changes daily. And if we wanted to buy additional straps, the cost just wasn't worth it. A similar watch and an additional strap could easily add up to 250$!So we decided to create the Mossepic Collection - an affordable and beautiful watch collection that will adapt to your ever-changing style.Your style transforms daily, you are constantly trying to reinvent yourself, so we wanted to develop a watch that would transform with you.  With the Mossepic Watch Collection, we wanted to give you the opportunity to own a watch that can meet your every desire. When you purchase our collection, you receive ONE PREMIUM WATCH and FIVE EASILY INTERCHANGEABLE STRAPS that allow you to change your style within seconds. Everytime your style changes, your watch can change with it in a matter of seconds. You can start the day with a classy leather strap for work, change it to a more casual nato strap for your afternoon errands and charm your dinner date with an elegant mesh strap.Why spend your money on 5 different watches that would suit different occasions when you can buy 1 Mossepic Watch Collection that can be transformed into any watch you need.It took us over a year to develop the Mossepic concept and define the collections that will meet all your style requirements while still ensuring the highest quality of all materials used. We wanted to give you premium quality at an affordable price. It took us a while to develop the Mossepic Collection since had two things in mind: not to settle for lower quality and obtain an affordable price.That is why the Mossepic Collection is THE FIRST PREMIUM 5 in 1 WATCH COLLECTION.The name Mossepic was defined at an early stage. It was simple and presented right what we wanted to create - the most epic watch collection ever.Our watch collection will give you “Your Touch Of Epic” every day.The design was inspired by simplicity infused with luxurious elegance. We wanted to create an eternal style that would never go out of fashion but was still edgy enough to always be on trend. Our designers came up with numerous concepts but it was the last design, the one now used for the Mossepic watch, that stood out since it satisfied all of our requests.We believe we managed to create a classy, elegant and contemporary timepiece with exceptional attention to detail and its versatility.Using the best materials was always a priority while developing the concept of our watch. We believed that having the highest quality in mind allows us to create a watch collection that will last for decades.
SAPPHIRE GLASSThe glass used in the Mossepic watch is sapphire glass, the second toughest material in the world (only the diamond is higher on the hardness scale). This means that it is extremely resistant to scratches and the least prone to shattering.Cutting and shaping the sapphire glass requires expensive tools, which is why we are glad we were able to give you both an affordable and top quality materials. QUARTZ MOVEMENTThe watch movement is the head and the heart of the watch and the quartz movement is considered to be one of the most reliable movements. We used the Miyota GL20 Quartz movement, which is extremely precise and efficient when it comes to keeping time -a virtue we believe is crucial for a quality watch.
QUICK RELEASE SYSTEMEach strap is equipped with the quick release system, which makes changing the strap on your watch very easy and fast. You can completely change the style of your watch within a matter of seconds without additional tools required.  5 YEAR BATTERY LIFEOur battery is made to last 5 years, that is more than double compared to similar watches on the market, that offer a battery lifespan of 2-3 years.
WATER RESISTANTThe Mossepic watch is 3ATM water resistant, which means you are able to wear it daily without worrying it might get damaged.
ALL STAINLESS STEEL & IP PLATINGOur Mossepic watch is made of stainless steel, a very strong material which is resistant to rust or stain. We used IP plating for achieving the precise colour of the watches we wanted. Tests have shown that this process is up to 8 times more durable than other conventional techniques.DIAMETER DIMENSIONSThe DIAMETER of the men's watch is 40 mm and the women's is 36 mm.When developing the Mossepic box, we had functionality, prestige and minimalism in mind. We believe we designed a box that you will be glad to keep on display and will offer you the perfect place to store your Mossepic Collection. If you wanted to buy a similar watch with additional 4 straps, you would have to spend up to $ 356!Buying the Mossepic Collection will save you an astonishing 75% if you catch our SUPER EARLY BIRD PRICE! We are extremely happy we were able to create a premium watch collection with amazing materials, mechanism, 4 additional straps, while still maintaining a very reasonable price.We were able to achieve this by cooperating with many different companies, finding which were the best at what they do and can guarantee a fair price.The result is our MOSSEPIC COLLECTION. We would love you to become part of our Mossepic family!

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Candice Padro and I am a jewelry designer from Queens New York.  I have been training in the arts for my whole life and I have degrees in fine arts, metal smithing and jewelry design.  </p>
<p>When I was 13 I fell in love with fashion and my dream was to become the next Betsey Johnson.  I wanted to provide unique products for the creative human who lives to stand out.  Three years ago I took the plunge and started to pursue my childhood dream of owning my own business.</p>
<p>As of right now I have been using my own money to fund the set up and production for Abstracted Reverie.  This campaign will give me the opportunity to invest in my business in a bigger way and help me reach my goals quicker.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Now let's get down to the brass tacks.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>My Intent</strong></h3>
<p>Jewelry for me is a universal wearable art that any human can invest in.  It transcends gender, skin color, weight and ethnicity.  It is an investment product, something that you can have forever and possibly pass down to future generations.  What you wear is your 'Hello' to the world but your jewelry is what sets you apart from the masses.</p>
<p>In this world of fast fashion we have lost site of what style and quality products are.  We waste our money on cheap product that falls apart and eventually is thrown away.  </p>
<p>My intention with Abstracted Reverie is to change the narrative.  Provide a high quality, unique product that is affordable.  When we move away from shopping at conglomerates in the spirit of convenience and put our money towards companies that care about their product, their customers and our environment we will change the way the fashion industry functions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a business at all is a huge risk especially in fashion during a pandemic.  I believe my passion, experience and vision will set me apart and make this company a unique investment.  I am committed to making this my future and I am confident it will be successful.</p>
<p>For me as an artist I take challenges and use them as lessons.  I welcome them, the only way we learn is if we encounter these challenges and I have the right attitude and mind set to get through whatever is thrown my way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money isn't everything!  Can't donate at the moment?</p>
<p>Spread the word!  Social media platforms are free marketing tools that everyone can use.  Probably the biggest help a small business can ask for besides buying product and donating money is supporting us through word of mouth.</p>
<p>So follow me on Facebook and Instagram, share my posts, share my campaign.  The more eyes I can get on this the greater chance I will have to succeed!</p>
</div></div>","Who Am I?
My name is Candice Padro and I am a jewelry designer from Queens New York.  I have been training in the arts for my whole life and I have degrees in fine arts, metal smithing and jewelry design.  
When I was 13 I fell in love with fashion and my dream was to become the next Betsey Johnson.  I wanted to provide unique products for the creative human who lives to stand out.  Three years ago I took the plunge and started to pursue my childhood dream of owning my own business.
As of right now I have been using my own money to fund the set up and production for Abstracted Reverie.  This campaign will give me the opportunity to invest in my business in a bigger way and help me reach my goals quicker.

What We Need & What You Get
Now let's get down to the brass tacks.
I am asking for $20,000 and this is what I am going to use it for.

Inventory!  This has been a huge pain point for me.  I have only been able to invest in small amounts of inventory at a time, leaving some customers to wait a long time to receive their orders.  My priority is customer satisfaction and the first step for this in my mind is to invest in inventory.
Website!  I currently have a functioning website but it's limited.  I would like to hire a professional to upgrade it and make it more user friendly.
Marketing! I have a lot of ideas for social media and e-mail marketing campaigns which will require photographers/videographers. I also have a list of stylists and influencers that I would like to work with that will require an investment in more product.
Future Collections!  My ideas for new pieces are never ending.  The problem with this is that starting a new collection requires the most monetary investment.  Having a cushion to develop new product will give me the opportunity to expand my line and attract new customers.
Emergency Fund!  I have encountered many road blocks the last three years, especially this last year.  These road blocks has required me to spend money when I wasn't expecting to.  I want to create a safety net for myself just in case I have more road blocks in the future.

What will you get when you contribute?

A huge thank you!  Any help that I am given will be received with immense gratitude
Product! If you donate within certain price brackets I will send you some of my existing designs and maybe some new items that aren't being sold yet

What if I don't reach my goal?
If I don't reach the $20,000 my first priority are my customers. 
I would take whatever money I do get and invest in inventory. 
If I have money left over I will throw everything into marketing, getting influencers on my team and produce more campaigns to attract a larger customer base that will translate to more sales.
My Intent
Jewelry for me is a universal wearable art that any human can invest in.  It transcends gender, skin color, weight and ethnicity.  It is an investment product, something that you can have forever and possibly pass down to future generations.  What you wear is your 'Hello' to the world but your jewelry is what sets you apart from the masses.

<p>I’ve been the student, young professional, the stay-at-home mom, and working mom. Through each stage of life, particularly motherhood, I found myself questioning why there wasn’t any bag on the market that helped me feel organized *and* stylish. I started using baby bags as my work bag long before I had kids because they had the best organizers, but I wanted a bag that didn’t scream “LOOK AT ME! I’M A MOM!” when I used it.</p>
<p>I needed 'the perfect everything bag' that could take me from weekends at Legoland, to the office, to lunch with friends in a snap. I needed a bag that was comfortable, durable, reliable, and made me feel like buying it was my own form of self-care. Necessity really is the mother of invention. I set out to create Francisco, designed with the working mother in mind. A bag to help any person using it feel beautiful, organized, and empowered to fearlessly take on life’s challenges.</p>

For words merely words; to breakthrough requires actions. You need not only 100% of hard work to breakthrough; But you need to devote much more of your time, your vitality, and your finance. Not everyone can accept products that are made outside of the box. But consider this: how can we human beings improve if “outside the box” designs had never existed?</p><p>I am JASON(Bios below), a designer who refuses to remain still. Our production line is incomparable with other normal brands; our’s costs money and time. Every part of every watch I designed are made unique, they are specially modelled and manufactured. For I used zero pre-made parts in my watch makings.</p><p>This is what innovation is about; this is art. And today, I wish to share my work with you all:</p><p><strong>Introducing JW-EX - The Exaggeration</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211540/gy39r4vi1e7jexwgioxk.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211576/spi3vra9xmm1fcng8bll.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211605/wcwocehucfkn9fzt85ha.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211626/iptidonj2l2apknxs9nf.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><p>JW-EX is a new beginning; marks a new direction for JW. My first impression of this electronic world is dull; as if we’re missing the mechanics. We who love mechanical watches adore the sensation of metal; the sound of machines running; the excitement of wheels clashing with each other. And so, I thought of Steampunk. Yet you would ask: is this watch really representing steampunk? The answer is no; it is a representation of Future Steampunk. </p><p>It may look ridiculous after infusing German’s simple steampunk into the watch, but please look at the result: Such a unique design! The straight lines bring steampunk a sense of futurism, a sense that breaks through the frame of the current generation of watches. It would feel like you’re wearing a robot from the future when you wear JW-EX on your wrist.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561514659/tn1h2tlosxrw5lplntyn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>ABOUT JW WATCH</h3><p>JW watch is a watch company founded by Jason Chan (myself) and William Shum from Hong Kong, aiming to create valuable innovative watches with excellent craftsmanship that can be savored by everyone, especially watch lovers. </p><p>William has shareholdings in the watch factory and is one of the founders of JW watch. Our factory has more than 30 years of experience in producing mechanical watch movements for SWISS brands. All of our movements are supplied from our in-house factory which guarantees the best quality in movements, stability, and finishing.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211679/g5xrlhw1obwvsaopmpdf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>*From our finished product JW-01, you can see our persistence in our work.

But when you look closer, the “red” on JW watches tells the time. I specifically placed the most important time telling part - the minutes - onto the top of the watch. Now you can tell the minutes at a glance, like the indication on an old steam engine. </p><p>On the right side of the watch, there is a rectangular sapphire crystal. And within it there lies a red triangular pointer, indicated as “Hour"". In this window, you can see the mainspring clearly. When you wind the watch, the mainspring will contract, storing up the energy of 80 hours power reserve.</p><p>On the left side of the watch, there is a circular sapphire crystal. And within it, there is a rotating circular plate; that is the “Second”. At the same time, you may see a heart-beating like balance wheel underneath the plate. This is possibly the most beloved part of the watch to many watch lovers. </p><p>Underneath the watch lies an extra crown for winding the watch, which provides comfortability to users. This watch obtains an automatic winding; even if you leave your watch untouched the whole weekend, your 80 hours power reserve watch would be still ticking. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211801/ajb7xbhvseegrmfzklal.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211814/a4nryl29ddydidthyslo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h3>IN-HOUSE MOVEMENT</h3><p>As my co-founder William manages the factory, we can guarantee the best quality movements used in JW watch.</p><p>JW-EX watch is powered by an all-new skeleton developed movement called JW-7100, it is approved and loved by many JW-01 backers. JW-7100 functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 21 jewels, automatic winding, a sweep second movement, and “Caliber: 173” (173 parts). Functionally, the movement provides up to 80 hours (3 days+) of power-reserve via a single barrel system along with its effective bi-directional winding rotor. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to find a watch with such finely polished movement at this price.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211851/hvkl1l69bvjhoe3ygei9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211869/cqa6mivcaoaletrvj15g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211884/em4j5fbzn3tj9frbihup.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211895/oyitleaxdm46nzncqywo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h3>CASE WITH MULTI-POLISHING</h3><p>One of the attractions of this watch is the high-quality watch case.</p><p>As you can see, there are different cuttings and different polishing in this case: Including vertical brushed, horizontal brushed and mirror finished. Each cutting angle is a process; one after another process is what makes this case worth the money. Every process needs a special set of polishing tools and needs to change the polishing angle each time. Thus, the labor cost of this case is high.</p><p>Besides using the 316L stainless steel, we have decided to use gunmetal plating for the sides of the three windows. Although different process raises up the labor costs, it heightens up the quality of the watch. And this is what we persist on – bringing the best onto your wrist.</p><p>Besides, we have put some thoughts on designing the case’s back as well.  I have spent much time on designing the back of the case to make it looks less bulky; it is a challenging task for a designer. A good designer does not only take notice in the design, but also at every angle. You can see that every angle is attractive in these pictures.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211924/ifdy4foovhqajhbvy15w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211942/lqippcvf88seg57b6twc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h3>WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</h3><p>Before our final production, we have gone through various trials: using 3D printers to create many prototypes and inviting different volunteers to try wearing the watch. Our goal is to provide a comfortable wearing experience for all of you.</p><p>What we need is your support for our MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity); for this production it is 200. Since our funding goal is set higher than before, we do not want to give our second best to you; instead, we want to give you the best. Thus, we persist to create the prototype and present it to you all. Please continually give out your support!</p><p> </p><h3>FINE CRAFTED ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAP</h3><p>Having an extraordinary and high-quality strap is very important for a watch. It is difficult to make a high-quality strap while maintaining an affordable price. It is, however, my duty to provide the best material for JW-EX. It is our pleasure to have a company that specially produces straps for Swiss Brands to help upgrade our straps. Although their price is higher than before and the MOQ(Minimum Order Quantity) is set higher, I think it is worth it. </p><p>Hence, I bring you the finely crafted Italian Calf Leather with an interchangeable catch which allows you to change your strap conveniently without any special tool. </p><p>There will be more straps for you to unlock in our stretch goal. Remember to invite your friends and family to support us! </p><p> </p><h3>HORWEEN LEATHER FOR THE WILD STYLE</h3><p>We have already added a new style - the Wild - into our selection and it is from an American leather producer which has more than 100 years heritage in hand-craft manufacturer technique.

For words merely words; to breakthrough requires actions. You need not only 100% of hard work to breakthrough; But you need to devote much more of your time, your vitality, and your finance. Not everyone can accept products that are made outside of the box. But consider this: how can we human beings improve if “outside the box” designs had never existed?I am JASON(Bios below), a designer who refuses to remain still. Our production line is incomparable with other normal brands; our’s costs money and time. Every part of every watch I designed are made unique, they are specially modelled and manufactured. For I used zero pre-made parts in my watch makings.This is what innovation is about; this is art. And today, I wish to share my work with you all:Introducing JW-EX - The Exaggeration JW-EX is a new beginning; marks a new direction for JW. My first impression of this electronic world is dull; as if we’re missing the mechanics. We who love mechanical watches adore the sensation of metal; the sound of machines running; the excitement of wheels clashing with each other. And so, I thought of Steampunk. Yet you would ask: is this watch really representing steampunk? The answer is no; it is a representation of Future Steampunk. It may look ridiculous after infusing German’s simple steampunk into the watch, but please look at the result: Such a unique design! The straight lines bring steampunk a sense of futurism, a sense that breaks through the frame of the current generation of watches. It would feel like you’re wearing a robot from the future when you wear JW-EX on your wrist. ABOUT JW WATCHJW watch is a watch company founded by Jason Chan (myself) and William Shum from Hong Kong, aiming to create valuable innovative watches with excellent craftsmanship that can be savored by everyone, especially watch lovers. William has shareholdings in the watch factory and is one of the founders of JW watch. Our factory has more than 30 years of experience in producing mechanical watch movements for SWISS brands. All of our movements are supplied from our in-house factory which guarantees the best quality in movements, stability, and finishing.*From our finished product JW-01, you can see our persistence in our work. You can also review the Backers' approval and enjoyment of JW-01. Feel free to click the LINK below for more details:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jasonwatch/jw-mechanical-designer-watch-jw-01 TIME-TELLING and all the sapphire crystalIt is always odd telling the time when it comes to JW watches. But when you look closer, the “red” on JW watches tells the time. I specifically placed the most important time telling part - the minutes - onto the top of the watch. Now you can tell the minutes at a glance, like the indication on an old steam engine. On the right side of the watch, there is a rectangular sapphire crystal. And within it there lies a red triangular pointer, indicated as “Hour"". In this window, you can see the mainspring clearly. When you wind the watch, the mainspring will contract, storing up the energy of 80 hours power reserve.On the left side of the watch, there is a circular sapphire crystal. And within it, there is a rotating circular plate; that is the “Second”. At the same time, you may see a heart-beating like balance wheel underneath the plate. This is possibly the most beloved part of the watch to many watch lovers. Underneath the watch lies an extra crown for winding the watch, which provides comfortability to users. This watch obtains an automatic winding; even if you leave your watch untouched the whole weekend, your 80 hours power reserve watch would be still ticking.  IN-HOUSE MOVEMENTAs my co-founder William manages the factory, we can guarantee the best quality movements used in JW watch.JW-EX watch is powered by an all-new skeleton developed movement called JW-7100, it is approved and loved by many JW-01 backers. JW-7100 functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 21 jewels, automatic winding, a sweep second movement, and “Caliber: 173” (173 parts). Functionally, the movement provides up to 80 hours (3 days+) of power-reserve via a single barrel system along with its effective bi-directional winding rotor. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to find a watch with such finely polished movement at this price. CASE WITH MULTI-POLISHINGOne of the attractions of this watch is the high-quality watch case.As you can see, there are different cuttings and different polishing in this case: Including vertical brushed, horizontal brushed and mirror finished. Each cutting angle is a process; one after another process is what makes this case worth the money. Every process needs a special set of polishing tools and needs to change the polishing angle each time. Thus, the labor cost of this case is high.Besides using the 316L stainless steel, we have decided to use gunmetal plating for the sides of the three windows. Although different process raises up the labor costs, it heightens up the quality of the watch. And this is what we persist on – bringing the best onto your wrist.Besides, we have put some thoughts on designing the case’s back as well.  I have spent much time on designing the back of the case to make it looks less bulky; it is a challenging task for a designer. A good designer does not only take notice in the design, but also at every angle. You can see that every angle is attractive in these pictures. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORTBefore our final production, we have gone through various trials: using 3D printers to create many prototypes and inviting different volunteers to try wearing the watch. Our goal is to provide a comfortable wearing experience for all of you.What we need is your support for our MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity); for this production it is 200. Since our funding goal is set higher than before, we do not want to give our second best to you; instead, we want to give you the best. Thus, we persist to create the prototype and present it to you all. Please continually give out your support! FINE CRAFTED ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAPHaving an extraordinary and high-quality strap is very important for a watch. It is difficult to make a high-quality strap while maintaining an affordable price. It is, however, my duty to provide the best material for JW-EX. It is our pleasure to have a company that specially produces straps for Swiss Brands to help upgrade our straps. Although their price is higher than before and the MOQ(Minimum Order Quantity) is set higher, I think it is worth it. Hence, I bring you the finely crafted Italian Calf Leather with an interchangeable catch which allows you to change your strap conveniently without any special tool. There will be more straps for you to unlock in our stretch goal. Remember to invite your friends and family to support us!  HORWEEN LEATHER FOR THE WILD STYLEWe have already added a new style - the Wild - into our selection and it is from an American leather producer which has more than 100 years heritage in hand-craft manufacturer technique. With its signature softness and uniqueness, it is the best strap we can choose from for you all! HONG KONG WATCH FACTORY AND WARRANTYWe own a Hong Kong watch factory with watch masters performing quality checks and maintenance for our watches. The quality of JW watch is highly controlled and guaranteed. We will also provide a 1-year international warranty. We are also hoping to unlock our 2-year international warranty goal; however, we need your support to help us to reach all of our stretch goals! TIME LINE THE MODEL HANDS-ON ABOUT ME (JASON CHAN) :I live in Hong Kong.

</div></div>","After more than 200.000 distributions worldwide of the original Silver Mask launched on Kickstarter in 2017, we decided to take it to the next level and create an ultimate premium mask by empowering protection, comfort and user experience.



Silver Mask 2 offers an advanced solution to the invisible, everyday encounters. The new and improved edition introduces exclusive and innovative features: Polygiene™ Treatment, an empowered replaceable filter with Anti-fog design, and an NFC Chip-connected app to monitor the Silver Mask 2 lifespan.

 


Silver Mask 2 provides four different levels of protection: Polygiene™ Treatment, a Silver embedded Layer, empowered replaceable Filter, and a hydro-repellent treatment. Check out all four levels of protection in-depth!

The outer cover has been treated with Polygiene™ Treatment, the latest in textile treatment technology.
The Polygiene™ Treatment resists up to 100 wash cycles.
 


The iconic Silver Layer (Ag) is now embedded in the inside of the outer cover. Silver works around the clock to keep the breathing environment healthy and neutralize bad odors.
It also allows moisture to easily evaporate and you can wash your cover whenever you want without compromising the silver function.


The built-in replaceable filter is composed of four different layers, each with a specific protective action.
Our empowered filters are the only ones on the market produced in Europe with premium materials that provide an extended lifespan (6-8 week average duration).
For any details about filtering and protective action, please comment or send a message to support@banale.com. 


With Silver Mask 2 you protect others too, thanks to a hydro-repellent treatment applied to the outer cover. This special treatment impedes any outgoing droplets coming out from the ventilation valve.
The valve is a very important feature in a face mask because it increases internal ventilation, reduces moisture and augments comfort. 

 

Protection matters but it’s nothing without comfort. Designing face masks since 2015, we know how important it is to supply our customers with something they can wear naturally and easily.
Thanks to the maximum comfort, the more you wear it, the safer you’ll be.




A removable foam buffer provides advanced comfort, adhering to any face shape. The unique design ensures an airtight seal that supports maximum filtering efficiency and enables a unique anti-fog defense system. 
To ensure optimal operation of the anti-fog design, the filter must be properly adjusted to adhere to the face.

In addition, we design a reflective band* that maximizes safety, especially for bikers. 
 *reflective band provided separately and mounted manually.


With its patented lace system, Silver Mask 2 offers versatility, maximizing personalized wear while rendering a stylish and convenient wear for active and inactive use. 

The lacing system allows for four different types of wear, ensuring maximum comfort suited for every type of wear, including with glasses and helmets.

With Silver Mask 2 one size fits all: pull the laces until the mask automatically adapts to any face. It will also fit with all different kinds of sunglasses and helmets.



Silver Mask 2 is the ultimate evolution of a design intended to get you comfortably covered in every aspect of your daily routine.
Its high standard of protection and comfort enables you to wear it while commuting, shopping, working and moving around in public spaces.


Silver Mask 2 is equipped with an advanced built-in NFC chip that enables tracking of the filter lifespan. Tap your mask to your smartphone by bringing the phone closer to the chip and beep: now the mask is connected!
The waterproof chip is seamlessly integrated into the mask, protecting it from unwarranted damages and frequent washings, maximizing hygiene and safety.

With the Banale web app you'll always be connected with your mask and can constantry monitor your filter lifespan. And refill filters are just one click away. 


The refill filters of Silver Mask 2 will always be available on BANALE.COM and the Banale web app, and are eligible for global shipment.
For 5 years we are committed to delivering refills and the spare parts to customers anywhere they need.
And with the new BANALE web app, ordering refill filters is easier, faster and more convenient.


Along with the Banale web app and Silver Mask 2, we are launching the Recycling Program, a new exclusive service by Banale.
Banale will collect the exhausted filters of your Silver Mask 2. Use the Banale web app to buy new filters and upon the delivery we’ll collect exhausted filters and recycle them correctly through our industrial partner BLS.
This new program is aimed to ensure the sustainability of your Silver Mask 2 and reduce the impact of replaceable filters on the environment.   



The washable cover can be hand or machine washed up to 60°, leaving you with a fresh and clean feeling.
It is recommended to let it dry in the open air and to avoid using an automatic dryer.
 

Silver Mask 2 comes equipped with a case, allowing safe storage of your mask and prolonging the filter lifespan during inactive use. 


Silver Mask 2 is state of the art in terms of protection. Get the most premium face mask on the market. Silver Mask 2 is the best in terms of comfort protection for you and those around you.

</h2><div>Thanks for checking us out. We've been hard at work building our dream into reality. </div><div>
<p>India alone produces<b> 1 BILLION </b>pairs of leather shoes every year, which requires slaughtering<b> </b>of <b>50 MILLION</b> cows - just so people can wear shoes! </p>
<p>As an animal lover, I gave up leather few years ago. It ached my heart when I learned how leather is made. In India, it is ILLEGAL to KILL healthy young cattle but they are beaten, deprived of food and water, dehorned, transported in appalling conditions and tortured with iron rods.  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>It is easy to find
great non-leather options for handbags, belts, jackets but we found it
impossible to find stylish yet affordable non-leather shoes- they were either super expensive or inferior quality. </p>
<p>We set out to solve this problem by
creating shoes which would be stylish, affordable and animal friendly. Our initial focus is on women's footwear, with aspirations to expand to mens and kids in the near term.  </p>

</div></div>","GREETINGS FROM KANABIS 
Thanks for checking us out. We've been hard at work building our dream into reality. 
India alone produces 1 BILLION pairs of leather shoes every year, which requires slaughtering of 50 MILLION cows - just so people can wear shoes! 
As an animal lover, I gave up leather few years ago. It ached my heart when I learned how leather is made. In India, it is ILLEGAL to KILL healthy young cattle but they are beaten, deprived of food and water, dehorned, transported in appalling conditions and tortured with iron rods.  


It is easy to find
great non-leather options for handbags, belts, jackets but we found it
impossible to find stylish yet affordable non-leather shoes- they were either super expensive or inferior quality. 
We set out to solve this problem by
creating shoes which would be stylish, affordable and animal friendly. Our initial focus is on women's footwear, with aspirations to expand to mens and kids in the near term.  
My name is Devika Srimal. I'm a Cross-Continent MBA student at Duke University and the founder of KANABIS. 


Why Kanabis (aka marijuana) ??

Our core animal friendly substitute for leather is canvas. Historically canvas was made from hemp, which came from cannabis plant. Kanabis is a play on the word Cannabis and lends itself well to our canvas products. 




What do we stand for ??




Our Vision



Spring/Summer 2015 - sneak peak...

   
                       Love Triangles                                                   Cherry Blush                            
       
             Li'l Miss Lacy                         Dance the Polka                   Jute Meets Lace            


What makes Kanabis...smoking?! 



Shoe story, true story - each shoe has been exclusively designed and has a story to tell.  To give an example, there's an old grandma saying - ""Opposite attract"". We tried that theory on our shoes- picked the rough jute and delicate lace and we got one good looking team- Jute Meets Lace (pictured above)




Comfort- All our shoes have • Insole
cushion  
• Durable
outsole    
• Open
toe feature for the hot climate  
• Painless
heels 





Price-
sits well with the emerging upper middle class in India 



High quality- all our materials have been hand picked to create 

a careful mix of fabrics for the right look and comfort, keeping compassion for animals as a core value
of the business.

<p><b>Our needs :</b></p>


To realize this project we need to raise € 60,000. The simple reason why we need this amount is because
banks do not support finance for a project which touches closely or indirectly to
eroticism. If the amount we require is not reached, it is not the end of our
project. We will use a part of the funds  to begin the
production of our products and subsequently present them at the various planned
exhibitions such as the AAE in Macao and the AVN in Las Vegas, both of which are
the most popular at the moment.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b>How we will use your
contributions :</b></p>
<p>A big part of the amount will be for development of the
electronic parts for our products, the creation of the application which will be
for used as the interface and to create our website : <span>€29,500.</span></p>
<p>The production of 16 prototypes (prototyping + realization) :  €16,000.</p>

<p>Afin de réaliser ce projet
nous avons besoin d’une somme conséquente 60 000 €. Pourquoi, pour la simple
raison que les Banques ne financent pas ce qui touche de près ou de loin à
l’érotisme. Si le montant de nos besoins n’est pas atteint ce n’est pas la mort
de notre projet, il nous faut néanmoins une certaine somme afin de pouvoir
commencer la production de nos produits, et par la suite les exposer dans les
différents salons prévus tels que l’AAE à Macao et l’AVN de Las Vegas, les deux
plus en vogue à l’heure actuelle. </p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p><b>A quoi serviront vos contributions </b>:</p>
<p>Une grande partie ira dans le
développement de la partie électronique de nos produits, dont la création de l’application
qui servira d’interface et de notre site internet : 29 500
€.</p>
<p>La production des 16 prototypes (prototypage + réalisation) : 16 000 €.</p>
<p>Investissement matériel
(imprimante 3D) : 2 800 €.</p>
<p>Production des

</div></div>","Our project is not only to produce a collection of Intimate Toys, by adding innovation to chic and elegant material and design, our Love Toys are connected.To achieve the target of our project, we need you.If we have tickled your curiosity, please follow us for more information.






 English
Our needs :


To realize this project we need to raise € 60,000. The simple reason why we need this amount is because
banks do not support finance for a project which touches closely or indirectly to
eroticism. If the amount we require is not reached, it is not the end of our
project. We will use a part of the funds  to begin the
production of our products and subsequently present them at the various planned
exhibitions such as the AAE in Macao and the AVN in Las Vegas, both of which are
the most popular at the moment.
How we will use your
contributions :
A big part of the amount will be for development of the
electronic parts for our products, the creation of the application which will be
for used as the interface and to create our website : €29,500.
The production of 16 prototypes (prototyping + realization) :  €16,000.
Material investment (3D Printer) :  €2,800.



The impact :







Perhaps
your curiosity urges you to know who behind this project; we are a balanced team, where everyone has found his place. 
- Sébastien, our creative consultant, works on the conception of designs of our products and the visual identity of our brand.
- Roland, is the jewellery
setter by profession, he brings his expertise in this art craft, he has previously worked for famous brand of French and Japanese jewellery.
- Morgan, got his savoir-faire from his experiences in the sector of hotels and catering industry, he leads the marketing, the management and also public and customer relations.

We are the base of this project, working in close collaboration for three years as a  functional trio.Since October 2011, we have conducted research and documentation
to develop quality products, design and high quality finish. We aim to bring jewellery into another dimension.



Our
manufacturing process and accessories are completely safe and are in accordance with the European standards, allowing us to guarantee
total reliability of our products. 









We use the
latest technology (3D Software, 3D printing, setting binocular microscope, laser engraving). 
We have developed a remote
interaction system on the object, using a Smartphone application which allows the user to
act on the remote accessory.Opening number of possibilities, for example : your partner
is on business trip to New York and he/she misses you... You just need to send a notification to him/her  and your companion takes things in hand ! So you can keep in touch through this little erotic
game. Almost 78% of women admit using a Sex Toy to spice up a relationship.
The USB
charging is an integral part of the services and products offered by our concept, but also other technological advantages we will reveal later.Our intimate jewels are customizable. Through used metals and our jewellery setting techniques (text or patterns), everything is
possible, the only limit is your imagination.



Implementing objects of such value
involve the creation of jewellery case with upscale setting.
In the same notion, to design
our products with high technologies, our accessories are presented to you in their
package and provided with a padded velvet, thermo-moulded base including the stand
charger, in accordance with our quality requirements.




Your compensations :

To reward you in exchange for your donation, we chose to create discrete jewellery in the image of our brand; these include bracelets, earrings and necklaces. In the case that of a contribution to our project being made by a gentleman, we are sure you will find someone to offer this to as a gift. We cannot forget the origin of our project you will find accompanied with your rewards, condoms and lubricant,     generously offered by our partner “GLIX” who have contributed in their way to our project. We thank them for their support.








The little preview of  our upcoming events are in this
calendar as below:






In conclusion, if our project has created some excitement
in you or your close relations, but you cannot contribute financially, we just ask you to kindly share our link and convince your friends to do it at a maximum, this shows your
input to our project moves it forward a little bit more and just for this,we are thankfull.

Notre projet n'est pas seulement de produire
une collection de Jouets intimes, raffinés et élégants, de part les matériaux employés
et leurs designs, mais aussi innovants, par leurs interface d’utilisation. Nos Love Toys sont connectés.Mais pour concrétiser notre projet nous
avons besoin de vous. Si nous avons excité votre curiosité, suivez
nous pour en savoir plus.






Nos Besoins:
Afin de réaliser ce projet
nous avons besoin d’une somme conséquente 60 000 €. Pourquoi, pour la simple
raison que les Banques ne financent pas ce qui touche de près ou de loin à
l’érotisme. Si le montant de nos besoins n’est pas atteint ce n’est pas la mort
de notre projet, il nous faut néanmoins une certaine somme afin de pouvoir
commencer la production de nos produits, et par la suite les exposer dans les
différents salons prévus tels que l’AAE à Macao et l’AVN de Las Vegas, les deux
plus en vogue à l’heure actuelle. 


A quoi serviront vos contributions :
Une grande partie ira dans le
développement de la partie électronique de nos produits, dont la création de l’application
qui servira d’interface et de notre site internet : 29 500
€.
La production des 16 prototypes (prototypage + réalisation) : 16 000 €.
Investissement matériel
(imprimante 3D) : 2 800 €.
Production des
contreparties : 4 500 €.
 Frais de la plateforme : 7 200 €.
L’impact :
Peut-être votre curiosité
vous pousse à savoir qui se cache derrière ce projet.Nous sommes une équipe équilibrée, où chacun a su trouver sa place.- Sébastien, notre consultant créatif, travaille à la conception des différents designs de nos produits et à
l’identité visuel de notre marque.- Roland, bijoutier sertisseur de métier, apporte son expertise dans ce domaine, ayant travaillé et sous-traité pour les
plus grande marques de la joaillerie française et japonaise.- Morgan, tire son savoir faire de son expérience en tant que directeur dans l’hôtellerie et restauration,
assumant la partie marketing, management, relations publiques et toujours à votre écoute.Ce sont les fondateurs de ce projet, travaillant en étroite collaboration depuis trois ans, c'est un trio qui fonctionne.   Depuis octobre 2011, nous
avons effectué un travail de recherche et de documentation pour développer des
produits  de qualité, design et de haute  finition. Nous avons pour objectifs d’amener
la joaillerie dans une autre dimension.


Nos process de fabrication,
en accord avec les normes en vigueur, nous permettent de garantir la totale
fiabilité de nos produits. Les accessoires sont normé et entièrement sûrs.
Nous utilisons les dernières
avancées technologiques (logiciel informatique 3D, sertissage binoculaire,
gravure laser).Nous développons un système d’interaction à distance sur l’objet, via une application Smartphone qui
permet d’interagir sur l’accessoire à distance.Cela ouvre de nombreuses possibilités, petit exemple concret : votre partenaire est en déplacement professionnel
à New York et il vous manque... Il vous suffit de lui envoyer une notification, à l'aide de l'application, et votre compagnon de plaisir prend les choses en main, ou plutôt le
contrôle de votre accessoire,  ainsi, vous gardez le contact au travers de ce support de jeu érotique à distance. 78% des femmes avoues utiliser un Sex Toy pour pimenter leur rapports.La recharge USB fait partie intégrante des services
et produits de notre concept, mais possède également d’autres atouts
technologiques que nous vous révélerons ultérieurement.Nos bijoux intimes sont personnalisable à volonté. Que ce soit au travers des métaux employés
ou des techniques comme l’enchâssement des pierres précieuses (textes ou motifs) tout est possible, la limite n'étant que votre imagination.Concevoir des objets d’une telle valeur implique de créer également leur écrin haut de
gamme.
Dans la même idée de développer nos produits avec des technologies de
pointe, nos accessoires sont proposés dans leur coffret muni d’un intérieur en
velours capitonné avec un socle thermo-moulé qui joue le rôle de base de chargement, dans la continuité de notre exigence de
qualité.

Vos contreparties :
Pour vous récompensez en échange de vos dons, nous avons fait le choix de créer des bijoux discrets à l’effigie de notre marque. Que ce soit le bracelet, les boucles d’oreille ou le collier, ils se portent en toutes circonstances et si Monsieur a contribué à notre projet, nous sommes sûres qu’il trouvera à qui l’offrir.Ces contreparties sont accompagnées en plus de préservatifs avec lubrifiant au format innovant généreusement offerts par notre partenaire ""GLIX"", qui a contribué à sa manière à notre projet. Nous les remercions de ce coup de pouce.

We will keep our backers updated throughout the process of the campaign and production to ensure that we deliver on time.A note on delivery date: As with any manufactured good, delays can happen -- a typhoon can hit, or a pallet can get stuck in a shipyard. We’ve padded our schedule to accommodate some changes, but will let our backers know immediately if we foresee any updates to the timeline for delivery. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED  We are so confident you’ll love our product and cause that we guarantee it! When you receive your perk, if you’re not 100% satisfied with the design or quality simply send it back for a full refund of the purchase price (Shipping and handling fees are non-refundable). We’re pretty sure you’ll be more excited to show or wear your support than return it though! Meet The Team Bret A.

<p>If you are reading this text, chances are that you are down
with the brown, and you appreciate the musical talents of Ween. If not, then it
is time to inform your self. This campaign is solely for the appreciation of
Ween and to give an original concept based on the Boognish to those who also
appreciate. The Boognish is the most iconic symbol that represents the music,
so out of curiosity I re-created the symbol as an earthy entity engulfed in
wood and tree. The re-creation became something aesthetically appealing so it
was then decided to construct some shirts with this design on the front. </p>
<p>  To achieve
this goal on my own I will need the help of other Weeners! If you donate $30
($25 for shirt $5 for S/H) or $50 for 2, choose your size and color (any size any color) you will receive your shirt(s) by the end
of the campaign which will last 30 days. Be aware that only 50 are going to be
made! These shirts will be printed with high quality ink from a garment printer onto
soft American Apparel shirts. The designs on the shirt will consist of a wooden Boognish on the
front and a Tibetan calligraphy style of writing with a hidden message on the
back of the shirt. For those of you who can guess what the image says you will
receive an extra gift in your package. If the specified goal here is not
reached, all of the funding will still continue to go to the construction of
these shirts and then to each buyer.</p>
<p>  If this
sounds like something you can dig on, then get a shirt or two. Only going to
print 50 according to the specified colors and sizes. Remember to share this
with others to spread awareness. Thanks for your time, looking forward to
creating these beauties for ya!</p>
<p>  Also if you
like what I do you can peep my instagram @imperial_peasant_tree and check for
more information on my work. Will have more original artwork and original
shirts to come.</p>

many people who do great things thanks to their passion, their love for
tradition and innovation as well. 
<p>That’s where Racconto comes from: in Italian Racconto means Tale.</p>
<p>I want to tell the story of
this beautiful country and its talented people through fine fashion products, made
with care using natural fibers, available both in my boutique and in Racconto online
shop.</p>
<p>Contributing to Racconto you
will be part of the story.</p>
<p>So enjoy with me this Italian
journey !</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What we need and what you get</b></h3>
<b>
</b>
<p>With your contribution I want to make real the Racconto capsule collection fall/winter 2015.</p>
<p>This is the color schemes inspiration for the collection</p>

<br/>
<br/>I think that Racconto fashion
products should be easily available online, to make the Italian Journey
possible from wherever you are.<br/><br/><p>In order to achieve the
complete Racconto fashion collection we aim to reach €40000 (forty thousands).</p>
<p>We plan to use the funds as
follows:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>€ 3500 web site with online shop<br/></p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>€ 2500 brand and packaging design<br/></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>€ 9000 marketing, advertisement<br/></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>€ 25000 development and production of the capsule collection f/w 2015</p>
<p>Contributing will grant you
interesting perks based on the contribution, going from an original thank you
note to a fine product of the Racconto fashion collection up to a stay in a

many people who do great things thanks to their passion, their love for

with care using natural fibers, available both in my boutique and in Racconto online
shop.

The rise of Etsy and other similar maker-focused sites over the past few years has dramatically altered the DIY landscape. Trends toward custom design, artisan quality and quick turnaround point to the customers' desire for less inflated pricing and individual and unique pieces. 


Our  FREE Fashion Design Genius, is currently hosted on Bootstrapfashion.com and outfitted with an entire selection of pre-designed sewing patterns. With the success of Fashion Design Genius, we released Fashion Design Genius Pro, a patent-pending revolutionary custom apparel design app.



Unlike commercially bought patterns, which can only be licensed for personal use and have a poor fit, various companies have co-opted our exciting, diverse sewing patterns for their commercial products and projects. Functioning companies are already actively implementing our patterns: Poppy and Bloom, Sydney’s Closet and MyrdaJ, along with many others, have taken advantage of what we offer to help create their collections.

""BootstrapFashion has given me the opportunity to have great patterns at my fingertips for my fashion line. Without it, I would have spent countless hours on patterns, grading and fit. I am beyond excited to be one of their loyal subscribers! This program is a real game changer for the fashion industry!"" MyrdaJ, an Indie fashion designer.





We've been through a very long creative process since March of 2013. From early concept development to design sketches, to building the design software and social platform, to custom-fit patternmaking and testing our custom fit calculator with thousands of users. It's all led us to the beautiful, fully loaded BoostrapFashion social platform ready to launch on March 1, 2016.  Up to this moment we have been true to our name and we have NOT taken a penny from outside investors, bootstrapping all the way.


Why do we need the money?




We’ve
built a revolutionary social network that features everything one needs to
design and make a single item or quantities of thousands.  
The
Design Center can now generate 250,000 unique designs, and custom-fitted sewing
patterns.
The
Fashion Mall and Find Services sections are helping designers, seamstresses and
fashion consumers alike to connect, work together, creating thousands of small
business worldwide allowing international collaboration, providing new sources
of revenue and enriching local economies. 
But
we need your help to bring our vision to the next level. Your support will
provide additional server space, technical support, better UX/UI, design libraries and features that
will revolutionize the entire fashion industry.






We believe we have developed a platform that will radically transform the way fashion is created, both in the United States and the world. No longer will top-brand designers be the only ones that set the standards in fashion. With  BootstrapFashion, we are leveling the playing field and making fashion creation easy, affordable and fun, so that the next great fashion innovation can come from anywhere and anyone. BootstrapFashion is yet another company delivering on the promises of the Internet and its ability to accelerate creation and spark inspiration. 
The BootstrapFashion team would like to thank you for taking the time to learn more about our company. We thank you for your consideration and look forward to seeing you on our site in the exciting times ahead!",22.0,1,"1 Campaign
