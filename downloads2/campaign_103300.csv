<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>Let us talk a bit about stretch-goal style milestones for funding. We are now fully funded and the artists are already at work on the illustrations for the book — that's great! Stay tuned for updates showing off some of the sketches that have come in.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's what happens if we pass select funding milestones:</p>
<p><b>At $3,000:</b> Each artist gets a 20% raise on their pay rate in thanks for signing on with the project early. I also want to thank you in advance, contributors, in case we hit this threshold.</p>
<p><b>At $5,000: </b>I write the sequel book for <i>Odyssey</i>, containing the complete game rules, a deeper look at how to play the game (and how to meddle with its components), plus a slew of new playset modes and mechanisms. This funding milestone helps pay for illustrations for <i>that</i> book, too.</p>
<p>If we draw near to the second milestone, I'll talk more about what this sequel contains and which perks get it. (Short version: The idea is that one could buy the two <i>Odyssey</i> books in any order and get the complete game, plus distinct playsets, mechanisms, and procedural content.) For now, one milestone at a time. </p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p><i>Odyssey</i> is a tabletop game about characters on journeys. It's about how journeys change us and how the person who departs on a journey can differ from the one who arrives at the destination. As you play, your characters change. As they change, stories emerge. So <i>Odyssey</i> is a game about stories, too, set in our world, in outer space, in fantasy realms — anywhere you can imagine.</p>
<h2><b>About the Game</b></h2>
<p><i>Odyssey</i> is a complete, introductory, story-driven game for 3-6 players that yields complete tales in about 2-3 hours. </p>
<p>In <i>Odyssey</i>, characters are defined by six characteristics written in plain language, usually combining two traits — an adjective and a noun. For example, a character might be both a Nefarious Treasure-Hunter and a Reckless Archaeologist. As the character confronts challenges along their journey, they gain and lose individual traits as a result of their experiences, so that archaeologist might stop being reckless or give up treasure-hunting (at least for a while).</p>
<p>This process of changing characters during play provokes dramatic questions. <i>How</i> was the character changed? <i>Why</i> did he or she change in this way? <i>What</i> does it mean for them as people? <i>How</i> does it affect the player's portrayal of the character?</p>
<p>Over the past two years, I developed <i>Odyssey</i> to be playable quickly, in any fictional setting, without a game master, so that students at the creative-writing camp where I teach could play the game within the imaginary worlds they built together. The game helps players think about characters as multitudinous beings, as complex and faceted persons that change over time. </p>
<p>It's also meant to be playable in a wide variety of worlds and styles without any experience necessary from other story or roleplaying games. The Odyssey beta edition ships with seven modes of play, including:</p>
<p><b>""Sojourn,"" </b>in which characters journey across a fantastical desert in search of a fabled city of the wise.</p>
<p><b>""Hyperfleet""</b> challenges each player to write and portray an ensemble of shared characters traveling across the cosmos in a ragged fleet of starships, fleeing from an alien invasion.</p>
<p><b>""Spirits of the Sea"" </b>offers an adventurous voyage across haunted seas with the players' characters as the crew of the sailing ship, <i>August Lion</i>.</p>
<p><b>""Passage of Years""</b> follows a handful of characters throughout their lives, from childhood through old age, by looking at the moments when those characters reenter each other's lives over the years.</p>
<p>A catalog of optional game mechanisms makes it easy to tinker with and build your own modes of play, too.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><b>About the Launch Edition Perks</b></h3>
<p>As you might guess once you see the beta edition, the launch edition of <i>Odyssey</i> will be a 6-inch x 9-inch black-and-white softcover book or PDF.</p>
<p><b>To clarify the DriveThruRPG physical-copy discount:</b> You'll get an email enabling you to buy a copy of the printed book at a steep discount (estimated cost is about US$5) and you'll also pay shipping. Please do check to make sure that you can order and receive shipments from DriveThruRPG before selecting the applicable perks. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b>Journey</b></h2>
<p>Three years ago, I sat down at my kitchen table and started sketching out notions for the game that would become <i>Odyssey</i>. Over the years, it transmuted into various interstitial forms — some of them funny, some of them overly complicated — but actual play kept guiding me toward something simpler and simpler. Years of play, like x-rays, revealed the bones of a fun, simple game within my original design.</p>
<p>So I made that simple game the heart of <i>Odyssey</i> and made everything else into a customizable, expandable, and optional toolbox.</p>
<p>Then I played the game with different options over a span of two years to see how everything held up in actual play. We've played <i>Odyssey</i> in homes, at conventions, and at writing camp — sometimes with rooms of 30+ players participating at once. It's been a terrific experience.</p>
<p>Now it's time for the final stress test. Now it's time for the game to meet a new audience. Now it's time to turn <i>Odyssey's</i> rules into a book.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/156021/files/20131026125259-Odyssey-mock-cov-rev-500.jpeg?1382817179"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>See for yourself. Contribute to this campaign and you'll get the complete beta-edition rules of the game as a PDF file within a few days. Play the game, let me know what you think of it, and maybe impact the course of its design and production.</p>
<h2><b>And Change</b></h2>
<p>Your money changes <i>Odyssey</i> from a vision to a reality. Beyond beta testing the game, this campaign builds up an art budget for the final rulebook. Funds raised pay each artist for their illustrations and me for my writing &amp; design time. A team of talents has already stepped up to illustrate this book, provided the funding comes through. This team includes terrific artists (though some portfolios may be NSFW):</p>
<ul>
<li>Leah Huete has dedicated her powers to good (or at least to art) for almost a decade, as a photographer and illustrator, and has provided words, photos, and illustrations to various RPG projects including <i>Technoir</i>, <i>Strange Tales of the Century</i>, various Posthuman Studios products, <i>One Shot</i>, and <i>Eternal Lies</i> for <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>. Leah lives with her three boys, and loves every cat. <a href=""http://lovelacearthaus.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See some of her work.</a>

<li>Phil Reeves works in print and graphic design but focuses his free time on drawing and gaming. Influenced by Frazetta, Lovecraft and Critchlow, with classical training in paint and pencil, he has since moved into exclusively digital pieces. The importance of a visual narrative is a central feature of his work, combined with a predominate use of contrasting light.</li>
<li>Steven Sanders, a comic and concept artist living in Kansas City, MO. Among other clients, he's worked for Marvel (<i>Infinity:The Hunt, Wolverine</i> <i>and the X-Men</i>) and recently Kickstarted <i>Symbiosis</i>, an open-source world-building art book. <a href=""http://studiosputnik.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See some of his work.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These artists aim to bring <i>Odyssey</i> to life with rich, vivid illustrations for each playset or ""mode"" of the game. A few, like Phil Reeves, have already begun work to give you a sense of the look they're creating for the game. Here's a glimpse at Reeves's progress on the illustration for the ""Lost Continent"" playset:</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us!</p>
<p>The finished version of Odyssey will be about 8–16 pages longer than the beta edition, including additional advice and clarifications based on the feedback I get from advanced readers. That might even call for additional art!</p>
<p>With enough contributions — with help from these wonderful artists and that wonderful you — I can produce the finished edition of <i>Odyssey</i> for publication and release at DriveThruRPG as a PDF file and POD book. Extra funds make it possible for me to spend time designing additional games and books, such as an <i>Odyssey</i> sequel book featuring new mechanisms and modes of play. With enough money, I can increase the pay rate of the artists on this book, too.</p>
<p>If we don't raise sufficient funds, fewer illustrations get commissioned, based on what I can afford to pay. </p>
<p>The look of <i>Odyssey's</i> first (or ""launch"") edition depends on you.</p>
<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
<p>I'm Will Hindmarch, a freelance writer and designer. My recent credits include fiction or essays in <i>The Thackery T. Lambshead Cabinet of Curiosities</i> and <i>Wonderbook</i>. I've worked, either on staff or as a freelancer, with Atlas Games, White Wolf Publishing, Fantasy Flight Games, and Green Ronin Publishing. I co-founded Gameplaywright Press with Jeff Tidball and am an advisor and designer for Protagonist Labs's forthcoming online story game, <i><a href=""http://storium.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Storium</a></i>. I've been a full-time professional in the game sector for more than a decade. </p>
<p>Most of my career has been spent making other people's games. To produce my own, I need help scraping together funds for art budgets, for design time, for production time. I've spent a lot of time on the game and the book already. Now I need help to pay myself and the artists who can make Odyssey as handsome as I've imagined it could be.</p>
<h2><b>Spread the Word</b></h2>
<p>It's a true fact that not everyone who wants to help always can, so I appreciate what you can do to get the word out about this campaign even if you cannot contribute to its funding. The more eyes that see this page, the more imaginations that get to play <i>Odyssey</i> during this beta, the better the game stands to be. Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

Much like the 'Time Crisis' and ""House of the Dead' saga you will control the shooting but you will now also control the head camera movements to look around. Also using motion sensor controllers to play the game the player will be able to wield duel guns in game that function separately to one another. 
I am a university student of Media Production
I am passionate about my work and always think big
This idea is possible and fairly simple to make
I am always looking to create new ideas that can change a bigger picture

 What Gets MadeI will create one level playable based in a western environment in which the player is to shoot random pop up targets in a full 360 scene. The aim of this is to achieve a high score before the time limit ends. Based on its success an additional level may be created in my time frame of project development.As for my game being different one thing 'Time Crisis' & ""House of the Dead' also had was there own device in which to play the game, i will not be going to that extent but i will be creating a small fold away game area to which you play from - as to avoid and breakages and to contain the player as they are static in game (added realism) What I Need & What You GetThis where your money will go and how it will help:
I am only asking for £600.
This is because the software I intend to use is commercially free and the money will buy the needed hardware.
£200 of the money will purchase me the 'Razer Hydra' motion sensor controllers for testing and playing the game
£300 of the money will buy a suitable computer on which I can create the game and run it 
£150 of the money will go on designing and building and small fold up gaming area as to contain the player when wearing the headset
£50 of the money will be for contingency in case of any problems throughout my project
As for the Oculus Headset, my University has very kindly got behind my idea and purchased two sets - because of this I will also be donating the motion controllers to the University Media department as thanks after my project (for future student use in an ever growing gaming medium)
If i do not reach my goal the money raised so far will still go towards either of the above factors, I am determined to create this game

My University does not require any addition computers and the computer I need is not of the specifications my University has.

<h2>Blocked</h2>
<h3>The minimum funding goal in here is $500, but I only need $100.</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Blocked is an idie game inspired by Lemmings and Minecraft. It's pretty early in development right now, but I have a lot of plans for it. This is my first real game and it would be incredible to get this on Steam Greenlight.</p>
<p>I have started programming in java about 1 year ago to make mods for Minecraft. After about a month I wanted more and started learning how to create my own games. I have made 2 games before this. One was a simple yet slightly changed Pong game and the second was something a bit like Mario.</p>
<p>If I get 100 dollars for this project I can get my game onto Steam greenlight and it would greatly help me to get <span>an audience</span> for my game.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get on Steam Greenlight I will have to pay 100 dollars. The full amount will be donated to Child's play, so if you support me you will indirectly support a charity.</p>
<p>The game will be a bit like Lemmings. There is an entrance where the people will come from and there will be an exit on the other side of the level. The Minecraft part of this game is that the game is made out of blocks.</p>
<p>The goal in the game is to help the people to get to the exit. You can do this by placing blocks and fixing the road for them, but also by giving some of them certain perks.</p>
<p>You can find some pictures from some harder and an outside level the gallery.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have asked several people what they think about this game and all of them think that this has great potential. </p>
<p>One important thing to note is that the 100 dollars will not only be donated to Childs play and help me to get this game on Steam Greenlight, but it will give me the chance to add an unlimited amount of games to it. This way you will not only help me for this one game, but also for later and possibly better games I make.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can really help me get this project started by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook or just by telling people in person.</p>
<p>Also if you have any suggestions for this game I would be happy to add them.</p>

races, Forest Elves and Lizardmen, cohabite. </i></p>
<p><i>Now, both lineages will dispute the control of their domains…
in a Football game!</i></p>

<div>Star Player Miniatures is a small and young company composed by four Fantasy Football fanatics and friends.</div>Playing FF for a decade, we know what coaches want. Our intention is to produce our ""dream miniatures"" to play with.</div><div>We have been deeply involved with the Fantasy Football community. We run the largest tournament in Spain, Reva Bowl, for 8 years, and now we go one step further with a more ambicious project such as Star Player Miniatures. </div><div>We work with the best sculptors and the best printers to get top quality miniatures.</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Campaign:</h3><div>Now it´s time for lizardmen, our third team. After dwarves and forest elves, we proudly introduce you our (we think) top team up to date. </div><div>Cold Blooded Warriors will be cast in metal and have been sculpted digitally.</div><div>Here you can see what you will get if you take one of these lizards home ;-) </div><div>
<a href=""https://sketchfab.com/models/afc7631ed5e14d7799244896d471cea0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Interactive 3D Big Lizard</a><br/>
</div><div>There are mainly three kinds of miniatures: the big lizards, small lizards and the lizard beast.</div><div>The big lizards, as strong creatures, will be a bit larger than 30 mm. On the other hand, the small lizards, are small, fast and scary creatures, and will be about 25 mm. The lizard beast... well, no need to explain ;-)</div><div></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Also, as it is our first campaign, we want to thank you with a great deal. Since the forest elves were self financed, no campaign was made. Now and here you have the chance to get them at a superb price. Don´t miss this oportunity!</span>

</div></div>","The Bayou, that mysterious place. Mystical and recondite,
we find beauty and danger alike. 
It is the territory where two of the most charismatic known
races, Forest Elves and Lizardmen, cohabite. 
Now, both lineages will dispute the control of their domains…
in a Football game!
Strength vs. skill… Who will make it to the top?
 Who is Star Player Miniatures?
Star Player Miniatures is a small and young company composed by four Fantasy Football fanatics and friends.Playing FF for a decade, we know what coaches want. Our intention is to produce our ""dream miniatures"" to play with.We have been deeply involved with the Fantasy Football community. We run the largest tournament in Spain, Reva Bowl, for 8 years, and now we go one step further with a more ambicious project such as Star Player Miniatures. We work with the best sculptors and the best printers to get top quality miniatures.The Campaign:Now it´s time for lizardmen, our third team. After dwarves and forest elves, we proudly introduce you our (we think) top team up to date. Cold Blooded Warriors will be cast in metal and have been sculpted digitally.Here you can see what you will get if you take one of these lizards home ;-) 
Interactive 3D Big Lizard
There are mainly three kinds of miniatures: the big lizards, small lizards and the lizard beast.The big lizards, as strong creatures, will be a bit larger than 30 mm. On the other hand, the small lizards, are small, fast and scary creatures, and will be about 25 mm. The lizard beast... well, no need to explain ;-)
Also, as it is our first campaign, we want to thank you with a great deal. Since the forest elves were self financed, no campaign was made. Now and here you have the chance to get them at a superb price. Don´t miss this oportunity!


The teams:

First of all, the lizardmen team, one by one.

And now the elf team. Here is the family picture. We will update the gallery with individual pictures of each miniature.

Stretch Goals:










And more to come...


Final details:

Expected delivery time is end of April 2016. Nevertheless, we are working to shorten timing.
If you only backed elf miniatures, your miniatures will be sent right after the campaign ends and we get back your pledge manager. Anyway, we are working to have both teams finished as soon as possible (we will keep you up to date).
If you have reached here, we hope you liked our miniatures and hope to meet you on a Fantasy Football field.

Thus Arrhythmia was born! </span></p><p>Arrhythmia's gameplay is created by the community that plays it for the most part, with the only exception being the official beatmap pack that comes prebuilt into the game. I wanted it to be a self sustaining community. When new music comes out the community can turn the music into new beatmaps for other people to play with the in game beatmap editor. Beatmaps consist of a folder holding a music file, an album cover, and a beatmap file. All of these combine to create the gameplay within the game. After they are made they then can be uploaded to our servers to be downloaded by other Arrhythmia users using the in game downloader.</p><p>The point of Arrhtyhmia is to stay alive all the way through the song / beatmap you choose. You loose a bit of your health every time you collide with an object / projectile emitted from the cube in the center of the game screen.</p><br/><h3>Project Summary</h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Since Arrhythmia's conception we have been spending nearly all our free time on making it better. Arrhythmia is at a point were yes it is at least presentable, but we've come to IndieGoGo in the hopes that we can make it even more refined and better with your help! With your support, we want to buy the required tools and services to make Arrhythmia even better then it is already! In order to accomplish this, we're hoping to raise $2,500 with this IndieGoGo project.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The majority of the money raised will go towards the following...</span></p><p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Unity Pro Licence - $1500</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A better server (to host beatmaps and user data) - $500</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Fees associated with Steam / Humble Bundle - $100+</span></li>
</ul><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The rest will then be going towards paying for the rewards and IndieGoGo fees. However, that doesn't mean we have to stop there! If more money then the campaign's initial amount is raised we can offer each of you more bang for your buck. Such as...</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Commission more musicians to make an original soundtrack for arrhythmia that would serve as a built in campaign mode for Arrhythmia.</span></li>

Thus Arrhythmia was born! Arrhythmia's gameplay is created by the community that plays it for the most part, with the only exception being the official beatmap pack that comes prebuilt into the game. I wanted it to be a self sustaining community. When new music comes out the community can turn the music into new beatmaps for other people to play with the in game beatmap editor. Beatmaps consist of a folder holding a music file, an album cover, and a beatmap file. All of these combine to create the gameplay within the game. After they are made they then can be uploaded to our servers to be downloaded by other Arrhythmia users using the in game downloader.The point of Arrhtyhmia is to stay alive all the way through the song / beatmap you choose. You loose a bit of your health every time you collide with an object / projectile emitted from the cube in the center of the game screen.Project SummarySince Arrhythmia's conception we have been spending nearly all our free time on making it better. Arrhythmia is at a point were yes it is at least presentable, but we've come to IndieGoGo in the hopes that we can make it even more refined and better with your help! With your support, we want to buy the required tools and services to make Arrhythmia even better then it is already! In order to accomplish this, we're hoping to raise $2,500 with this IndieGoGo project.What We Need & What You GetThe majority of the money raised will go towards the following...
Unity Pro Licence - $1500
A better server (to host beatmaps and user data) - $500
Fees associated with Steam / Humble Bundle - $100+
The rest will then be going towards paying for the rewards and IndieGoGo fees. However, that doesn't mean we have to stop there! If more money then the campaign's initial amount is raised we can offer each of you more bang for your buck. Such as...
Commission more musicians to make an original soundtrack for arrhythmia that would serve as a built in campaign mode for Arrhythmia.
Offer better / additional perks then those originally stated! Such as additional alpha codes for your friends!

</h3>Most of us have on occasion borrowed a game or two from our friends - games that we were not only excited to play, but equally as excited to not have to pay for the experience. Most of the time, that same friend might have wanted to borrow a game from you - a mutually beneficial endeavor to say the least.<br/><br/>Now imagine having the ability to trade your games with people across the entire country, not just your close circle of friends.<br/><br/>At Game Gorilla, we offer just that. Our patented algorithm matches up users from across the country and allows them to trade their games with each other in the safest environment possible. Consequently, your circle of friends just got much bigger. And here's the good part, all users deal with us directly, and we guarantee a successful trade from the beginning to the end of the process.<br/><br/>We can't complete this endeavor without you. As a contributor, you will be helping us establish the best interactive web experience possible. The interface of Game Gorilla is extremely easy to use. Users will list the games they want to trade, as well as input the games they desire. We take care of the rest. One of the benefits of Game Gorilla is that users never have to deal with the general public. All games come through our facility where they will all go through a 10-point inspection process before being sent to their respective owners. When your game is sent to you, you can be assured that it will be in 100% working condition.<p><br/></p><h3></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""></span></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/525065/files/20140422065139-logo-small.png?1398174699"" src="""" style=""""/> <span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">//</span><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""> The Breakdown</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul>

<p style=""""><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">What are the funds for ?</span></strong></p>
<p style="""">The funds we are hoping to raise will allow us to develop the game and make major improvements. These improvements are absolutely crucial to help the game be an international success: as cool as Kartoon may seem, it needs more completion and advancement to reach thousands of players – that will bring success.</p>
<p style="""">Kartoon is a free-to-play game: it’s free and you can play it on Facebook. If the players wish to, they can pay small amounts of money to play more, or to buy more efficient equipment.</p>
<p style="""">Improvements :</p>
<p style="""">- <strong>A multi-players mode in real time</strong>: Race against your friends in real time, anywhere, at any time on Facebook. This is the ideal feature and we need a lot of time and resources – a lot more than 10 000€ </p>
<p style="""">- <strong>Other missions, other enemies</strong>: We'll have to create a lot of them for the players to not be bored and to constantly provide new challenges.</p>
<p style="""">-<strong> Tournaments</strong>: Players will be able to bet with virtual currency and win high quality equipment; there is nothing better for competitive racers.</p>
<p style="""">- <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: NPC (non player characters) for players to train racing.</p>
<p style="""">- <strong>New maps</strong>: It's important for the replay value. Players need to have different fields and environments anytime it is possible.</p>
<p style="""">- <strong>""Ghosts"": </strong>These are records of friends' races: players can see the ghosts of their friends on the road when they’re not currently playing from the previous games.</p>
<p style="""">- <strong>New weapons, equipment, vehicles:</strong> In order to diversify what we offer to the players and to propose a huge range of funny equipment to customize the karts.</p>
<p style="""">As you can understand, there is still a lot of work to do. We are proud of what we have already achieved, but there is a long way to go before the game is economically viable. </p>
<p style="""">We ask for 10 000€. It is both ambitious and merely not enough. Developing a game is very expensive, and we secretly hope to exceed this sum...See what happened to this <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cwandt/pen-type-a-a-minimal-pen?ref=live"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Minimal Pen</span></a> on Kickstarter (Indiegogo-like website) They asked for $2500 and got $300 000!! Let's show that Europeans can also massively back-up a project they believe in!</p>
<p style="""">Finally, funds will also help us buy the counterparts! If we obtain what we need, you'll have collector items, 3D figurines, and credits to be used in the game...And if you are very generous, you'll get your own 3D character in the game...</p>

<p style=""""> </p></div>","If you don't want to read all this smooth talk, go PLAY KARTOON 
(but please come back right after that) http://www.facebook.com/Kartoongame
We believe that Facebook players need more quality games, not marketing and statistics driven. In a word, fun games. 
In the middle of a mysterious desert, occurred quasi-supernatural events...Disgusting little insects sprouted from the ground and multiplied after an enigmatic meteorite hit the village nearby.But these small insects have interesting properties, once you know how to manipulate them. 
After some DIY-job, farmers have succeeded in extracting a strange fluid from them that boosts tractors and turns them into fast cars, or that turn vegetables and fruits into destructive weapons.
Let's enter Kartoon's world in pictures 
That's Roy. We're going to help him, or he’s going to help us drive our first fast car, depending on the point of view. He's not super-confident so we'll need to take this mission cautiously.

In the beginning, Roy looked like this

 
Hopefully, dirty Sancho is here to help us but he'll probably make us go through the mill...
 
So you'll need to demonstrate your pilot skills on upgraded tractors that went through different evolutions called experimental vehicles.

 
This is your first vehicle. Don't worry. You'll be able to customize it with motors, wheels, shields, tanks...
 

 
… and if you are good you'll get karts like those :



 
Finally, you'll start in the Canyon map, which also went through different development steps. As you can see, video games are just drawings at the beginning...
 

 
Oh, and I almost forgot! Your weapons are these terrible fruits and vegetables stuffed with fluid. Caution: KEEP CHILDREN AWAY! 
 


Eventually, you'll need them to face off with the bundles of straws that lay dangerously on the ground, the vindictive moles, and soon the merciless cows as well! But why are those animals THAT mean? You have to understand them. They feel left behind because no one takes care of them any longer since all the farmers have become fond of tractor races...It pisses them off!



 
We still have a lot of great ideas to put into that game to improve it.
It will be possible ... thanks to you
  
 
What are the funds for ?
The funds we are hoping to raise will allow us to develop the game and make major improvements. These improvements are absolutely crucial to help the game be an international success: as cool as Kartoon may seem, it needs more completion and advancement to reach thousands of players – that will bring success.
Kartoon is a free-to-play game: it’s free and you can play it on Facebook. If the players wish to, they can pay small amounts of money to play more, or to buy more efficient equipment.
Improvements :
- A multi-players mode in real time: Race against your friends in real time, anywhere, at any time on Facebook. This is the ideal feature and we need a lot of time and resources – a lot more than 10 000€ 
- Other missions, other enemies: We'll have to create a lot of them for the players to not be bored and to constantly provide new challenges.
- Tournaments: Players will be able to bet with virtual currency and win high quality equipment; there is nothing better for competitive racers.
- Artificial Intelligence: NPC (non player characters) for players to train racing.
- New maps: It's important for the replay value. Players need to have different fields and environments anytime it is possible.
- ""Ghosts"": These are records of friends' races: players can see the ghosts of their friends on the road when they’re not currently playing from the previous games.
- New weapons, equipment, vehicles: In order to diversify what we offer to the players and to propose a huge range of funny equipment to customize the karts.
As you can understand, there is still a lot of work to do. We are proud of what we have already achieved, but there is a long way to go before the game is economically viable. 
We ask for 10 000€. It is both ambitious and merely not enough. Developing a game is very expensive, and we secretly hope to exceed this sum...See what happened to this Minimal Pen on Kickstarter (Indiegogo-like website) They asked for $2500 and got $300 000!! Let's show that Europeans can also massively back-up a project they believe in!
Finally, funds will also help us buy the counterparts! If we obtain what we need, you'll have collector items, 3D figurines, and credits to be used in the game...And if you are very generous, you'll get your own 3D character in the game...

The Team
At the beginning, we were two friends, Lucas and Alex, with an idea: make the Facebook games funnier, nicer, 3Dier! It was April 2011, and we've come such a long way. 
The idea couldn’t be that bad because Florent joined us, then Yohann, Yoann, Florian and finally Mehdi. 1 art director, 1 game designer and 3 programmers.
This team of 7 created the video game studio Kadank We hope to go far and create awesome games. As we use a multi-platform development tool (Unity3D) we'll be able to launch the games on smartphones, tablets, chrome and apple stores...

</div></div>","Cerasis Quest is a story book with mini-games for iOS, we need funds to complete our work!

   What is ""Cerasis Quest""? 
Cerasis Quest is a graphic tale with illustrations, quizzes and brain-teasers. The app isn't finished yet so it's free at the moment, but it will become a paid application. We promise a free version of the complete app to all contributors (even just  1€ )! We also offer many rewards (see the rewards section). We plan to complete the app as early as possible (probably September 2015). We will update this page and post all our progress on the Facebook page! You can try the current game for free, we have made the first chapter of the story.




CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP FROM APPLESTORE (free download)




The gameplay is very simple. You read the fantasy story, followed by music and manga-style illustrations, interacting with story-solving quizzes and other mini-games.


     



Prologue: ""It was a holiday in the kingdom of Aurantìaco, when a mysterious flying octopus interrupted the royal engagement festivities and kidnapped the prince. Help Princess Cerasis find her love, accompany her on this fantastic adventure. Read the story, take the quizzes, navigate the labyrinths, tackle the brain-teasers and other games. What mysterious and interesting characters will you encounter during your walk? Find out along with the Princess.""
We produce all the drawings in pencil, then we ink them and finally we color them on the computer.

    

    



The world of Cerasis Quest is divided into 6 different areas (prologue + 5 chapters). On the map of the game you unlock different worlds as you complete these chapters. Each chapter will contains two or more mini-games. The mini-games can be quizzes, memory games, mazes, puzzles, or games of skill.






In each chapter, new characters are added. We have already sketched out the various characters.












We created an original soundtrack for the game. We used an electric guitar, sound effects, and Garage Band for Ipad. Several music pieces accompany the story. We have created themes for each event: fantasy, mysterious, fairy-tale, etc. ...

MUSIC of the PROLOGUE

MUSIC of the FOREST

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The <b>Battle Fleet 2</b> Expansions campaign is a tiered funding campaign that starts with the Atlantic Campaign expansion for the initial funding goal of $5000. Once the funding exceeds that original goal, new feature tiers will be unlocked and slated for development in future updates of the game. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/970070/files/20141029174555-640px-Convoy_routes_1941.jpg?1414629955"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This initial budget will be used to add the single player Atlantic Campaign to complement the existing Pacific Campaign. In order to do this we need to create a specialized Atlantic map, 12 new territory battle maps, create new models of ships and aircraft to match the ones used in the Atlantic during WW2 and add merchant ships to tie in the concept of convoys into the game. </p>
<p></p>

<i>Bismarck - courtesy of German Federal Archive</i><p></p>
<p>If the funding goes over the $5000 required for the Atlantic Campaign we will then put that extra amount into more features to continue making the game even better. Not only that, we will actually let YOU vote on which feature we develop next. That's right, as a Battle Fleet 2 supporter you will get to have a say in how the game develops! </p>
<p>Additional features will be split into $5000 funding blocks and once a block is reached we will put it to a vote and the supporters will select which feature set we work on next. For example, once $10,000 is raised every supporter will use their votes to vote up their favorite feature, the one with the highest votes will be developed and added to the game. <i>*The only case where voting will be skipped is if someone makes a Fleet Admiral level contribution at which point they will be able to decide which feature that contribution will be spent on.</i></p>
<p>It will take 2-3 months to complete each expansion.</p>

<p>  As a start we want to create a browser-based RPG game with lots of social elements, exciting content and tons of fun for the player. We are currently building a prototype for the game mechanics. First glimpses of the world are also emerging from our Art vaults. We have lots of cool ideas about battles, classes and skill sets to forge an exciting gameing experience. Finally, the game will offer numerous original story-lines through both singleplayer and multiplayer on a large scale.</p>
<h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
<p>  Project E is a <strong>R</strong>ole-<strong>P</strong>lay <strong>G</strong>ame with turn-based battles. The game will offer different classes of characters which players will shape as they see fit. We have developed a complex system of attributes that can be manually chosen from or decided by the computer instead. At the very beginning of the game players will embark into an exciting adventure with a new hero with no particular skills. Each player will have the opportunity to customize and perfect their prefered abilities.</p>
<p>  The character skills in Project E are one of its strongest features. We have 100 + different skills available to the players divided into two major groups: offensive and defensive. The core of the game mechanics constitutes of stacking negative effects on the opponent to limit his resources and at the same time managing player’s own condition. We want to turn the battles, especially the multiplayer group raids against monsters, into epic clashes with deep strategy elements. One can also “relax” developing their hero with side quests and 1 on 1 battles against other players, or AI.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
<p>  <img alt=""Alpha stage interface"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/521761/pictures/full/20121104013709-battle.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-right: 3px;"" title=""Battle""/>We are paying special attention to the multiplayer experience and the team-play. Players will participate fully in the combat, choosing which skills and abilities to use at any time. The result of the fight will depend more on their skills rather than on a Random Number Generator (RNG). Differences in character level can be overcome with smart decisions and clever choices.</p>
<p>  We will offer Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs Environment (PvE) engagement. For our competitive players we will provide a constant struggle for dominance over their foes. It ranges from quick 1 on 1 Matches, where different skill configurations can be tested, to huge battles of up to 10 vs 10 players. For those who prefer exploration and are anxious to uncover the story of the world, a multiplayer option is also important as players will need friends to complete the more difficult quests in the game. Once we get up to speed we intend to introduce a Guild system. Being a part of a guild will give players the opportunity to participate in Raids (PvE) and Guild Battles (PvP). The raids will range from epic monster hunts to complex Boss fights with difficult mechanics. The guild battles on the other hand will allow numerous players to trade blows defending the honour of their guild. No-matter what the engagement, our multiplayer system will always bring lots of rewards to all of you.</p>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p> <img alt=""Concept Artwork"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/521764/pictures/full/20121104013929-2_pres.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""The Inn""/> The social element in the game is another focal point of the project. The game will use “FB connect” for connecting players and easy communication. We want to offer our players full and engaging social experience. The project will be available online through the dedicated website we are building. Players can either create a new account with the Endemiron project or use their Facebook account via FB connect.</p>
<p>  The main idea is to make communication and interaction between players easy and natural. Friends can chat and plan their common quests. They can use their friends’ heroes and skills for team adventures and PvP battles. A really cool feature is the option to “borrow” your fellow’s hero and with multiple heroes to go on a quest. During such quests the player will have control over all heroes in his party with all their available abilities. <br/>The social element brings unique aspect to the Reward system of the game. Players will receive additional rewards for doing battles when controlling multiple heroes. At the same time their friends will be rewarded for “lending” their own. <br/>  The Guilds in Project E are with high social function. They will be the family of the players in this world full of cruel monsters and other hungry for fame competitors. The Guilds will be entitled to unlock special “Guild bonuses” that will benefit their members. Meanwhile the success of the Guilds will strongly depend on the selfless effort of each player and the common struggle for epicness. <br/>  Most importantly we want to make this world open to everyone. We want players to feel a part of it in every possible way. We would like to provoke our friends and fans to be actively involved in the development of the game and will appreciate their feedback. On that note, we have some very interesting ideas about various mechanics through which players will be stimulated to contribute to this growing project. The first one of these ideas is introduced in the Perks.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/521758/pictures/full/20121104013339-world_pres.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Environment""/></p>
<p>  The art direction of our world is fantasy oriented but with strong Steampunk elements. The story unfolds through various eras - all with distinct looks and art-style. This allows us to blend genres and create internal references. We have many wild ideas about environment, characters, items etc. We want to create an unique atmosphere that will immerse the player in the depth of the experience. For now, things are a bit chaotic in our workshop but that is normal for every creative process. To confront the growing need of artwork we are installing a new “Steampress”. The chief engineer assured us that it will be able to produce an abundance of epic visuals</p>
<p>  <img alt=""Concept art of a warrior"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/521759/pictures/full/20121104013418-Warrior_pres.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Warrior""/>The game in Project E starts in a late era where the world gets rebuilt after some major events. This period introduces a technology-meets-magic kind of feeling and is known by the scholars for its early steampunk dominance because magic is no longer working on a massive scale. We try to differ from the rich and luxurious Victorian age that is commonly used in the steampunk culture. Instead, we want to focus on an earlier stage of the steampunk development where things are raw, a lot dirtier, darker and where getting-the-job-done is more important than aesthetics and style.</p>

<h3>Project E world and stories  </h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>   Epic visuals go hand in hand with cool stories. We have set the scope of our world on a massive scale. We are creating a rich history full of exciting and groundbreaking (sometimes literally) events. Epic battles, cataclysms, enduring heroes and cunning villains inhabit this fairy landscape. The history spans over three different eras and describes the rise and fall of various dynasties. Empires grow and crumble, rulers change, new religions divide the land and brave heroes unite the people. Magic and Spiritualism that once thrived and made obsolete Technology and Pragmatism had waned. Mechanical devices are filling the gap as innovation and practical inventions become the new </span><span>standard of the world.

<p dir=""ltr"">    The story in Project E begins in the city of Volaxor. Exactly at noon of the first Friday of the month, the usual announcement by the Voice of the City Council was a little different this time. The herald was noticeably anxious which attracted the attention of everyone.</p>
<p>“ Heed me Volaxorians !</p>
<p>I,  the Voice of the City council, announce that a great Expedition, coordinated by the City council and his supremacy The Grand Magus of the Order, will be sent by the end of the year far beyond the west plains.

<p><strong>Plans for development (why do we need the money)</strong></p>
<p>  In terms of development we are working on a Demo before the Full game is launched.</p>
<p>  We find the Demo stage of extreme importance. It is the stage when every ingredient of the game - game mechanics, art and programming - come together to create a working product. This is the time for introduction of all the necessary features and their testing. A significant amount of story and art content is scheduled to be finalized during this stage as well.</p>
<p>  A website for the game and for our community is to be launched along with the Demo. The site will feature forums, a blog, developer’s diaries and other communication channels. A portion of the site will be a library of knowledge (the Lore Panel see Perks!) where all the knowledge about the growing world will be preserved. The game itself will be featured on this site with its own interface and style.</p>
<p>  We need the $7500 to officially launch the Full Game. We are already working on and self-financing the Demo.</p>
<p>Below we would like to present a general plan for achieving our goal:</p>
<p>  <strong>Objective:</strong> Completion of the Demo and launch of the Full Game. <br/><em>Note:</em> It is possible that the Demo launch will occur during the time of our Indiegogo campaign.<br/><strong>Estimated duration:</strong> 3-4 months<br/><strong>General overview:</strong> The completion of the Demo is divided into three steps. Each of them is planned to be with average length of 45 days. During each step, new software features will be implemented. The steps are planned, as follows:<br/><strong>1 step</strong> - First version of the game (Project E v0.9) launch: fundamental game features installed, players may have basic PvP battles, first version of the web-site launched, concept art for the battle interface created.<br/><strong>2 step</strong> - Implementation of Player vs Environment encounters and reward system; introduction of Invite-a-friend system for massive battles; introduction of first set of quests, introduction of first Boss quest, first glimpse in the world of Endemiron - presentation of the first stories. <br/><strong>3 step</strong> - Introduction of Item generation system; emphasis on content and art generation; introduction of several new quest sets; fine tuning and last moment tests for software glitches and problems. Official launch of the Full Game.</p>
<p>  The estimated expenses for achieving our goals are divided into two main categories:<br/>- Human resources - the intensive art and software generation, as well as the on-going system maintenance, require a modest, yet fair remuneration for our small team of specialists. Our team is currently consisting of two awesome artists and two mystical software gurus who don’t require much to continue practicing their craft but still have a tendency to become angry when not fed for some time. <br/>- Administrative expenses, such as server maintenance, hardware issues, etc.</p>

<p><strong>The Team</strong> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>    Our team is small but feisty. The basic lineup came together with the beginning of the project more than an year ago.  At the same time we are all close friends and we achieve our best through constant creative argument and vicious word battles. As a team of passionate gamers we like playing and most certainly would love to make a game of our own.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>    In the center of the team is Borislav Grigorov, along with some great experts and creative minds, such as Zlati Pehlivanov - lead programer; </span><span>Alexander Grantcharov - Marketing, Creative Direction and </span><span> Velizar “Nordic” Ivanov -  lead artist.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>    The main driver and creator of the world of Endemiron, and subsequently the game, is Borislav Grigorov. On a personal note, Borislav has just turned 30 and, thankfully, the first signs of wisdom started to appear in his RPG-obsessed eyes. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>    More than one year ago he shared his ideas with us and we just fell in with his passion about this project. Since then, Bobi has been working relentlessly. He developed the story of the world of Endemiron on a massive scale encompassing 3 large eras of history and in the process tons of lore was developed. The original battle system of the game was also designed. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>    Zlati Pehlivanov is our leading software specialist. He is with the team from the very beginning. He is the guy to go to if you need anything connected to programming and software codes. Zlati will be responsible for the 24/7 maintenance once the Demo is launched.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">    His expertise covers about 75-80% of all skills required for the game to start. For the other 20-25 % we usually turn for some part-time help to close friends of ours. And this part of the programming is the first line of expenses that we need to finance with your generous contributions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>     We have some very talented concept artists on the team to visualise the extraordinary world we are creating. Velislav Ivanov (Nordic) is our lead artist. In the workshop he is the main engineer of the Steampress. He is responsible for giving shape and bringing to life all of our wild ideas. Other great artists that help in time of need are Kalin Georgiev and Miroslav Petrov (Soulsart). Kalin is a designer and conceptualist. He constantly pushes the boundaries of our imagination and pursues an ever bigger scale to make things epic. Miroslav is a veteran in the game industry and his experience as an art director at Masthead Studios is extremely valuable. Some of the awesome art created by our team can be seen on this page.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">    Our evergrowing workshop needs constant engineering work. All the miles of copper pipes need to be checked and the pressure maintained throughout the entire installation. For the steam to flow smoothly and the gears to turn in the Steampress we have Boris Angelov to thank to. He does all that heavy IT work and is responsible for network and server support .</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>    We take really seriously the PR and marketing side of our project. We strongly believe that the success of Project E will depend to great extent on the community of passionate supporters and friends. We would like to involve the players not only in playing the game but in the creation as well. Based on the that the job of the community manager is the hottest seat in the house. And this seat is well reserved for </span><span>Alexander Grantcharov - our epic PR guru.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">   We are constantly looking for good talent to join our cause. So if you want to give us a hand in development or with art, please contact us at  <a href=""mailto:arena@endemiron.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">arena@endemiron.com</a>.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Hi there,
  We would like to share with you our idea. We call it the Endemiron Project. (a.k.a. Project “E”)
  We are a team of passionate gamers with extensive experience in the gaming lifestyle. Killing monsters with our friends is usually of higher priority than the trivial necessity of grocery shopping or getting healthy amount of good night sleep. We know what makes a game great. So far, we are continuously missing some vital details in the available browser-based titles. So, our journey in the jungle of the game industry begins.

  As a start we want to create a browser-based RPG game with lots of social elements, exciting content and tons of fun for the player. We are currently building a prototype for the game mechanics. First glimpses of the world are also emerging from our Art vaults. We have lots of cool ideas about battles, classes and skill sets to forge an exciting gameing experience. Finally, the game will offer numerous original story-lines through both singleplayer and multiplayer on a large scale.
Basic Gameplay
  Project E is a Role-Play Game with turn-based battles. The game will offer different classes of characters which players will shape as they see fit. We have developed a complex system of attributes that can be manually chosen from or decided by the computer instead. At the very beginning of the game players will embark into an exciting adventure with a new hero with no particular skills. Each player will have the opportunity to customize and perfect their prefered abilities.
  The character skills in Project E are one of its strongest features. We have 100 + different skills available to the players divided into two major groups: offensive and defensive. The core of the game mechanics constitutes of stacking negative effects on the opponent to limit his resources and at the same time managing player’s own condition. We want to turn the battles, especially the multiplayer group raids against monsters, into epic clashes with deep strategy elements. One can also “relax” developing their hero with side quests and 1 on 1 battles against other players, or AI.
Multiplayer
  We are paying special attention to the multiplayer experience and the team-play. Players will participate fully in the combat, choosing which skills and abilities to use at any time. The result of the fight will depend more on their skills rather than on a Random Number Generator (RNG). Differences in character level can be overcome with smart decisions and clever choices.
  We will offer Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs Environment (PvE) engagement. For our competitive players we will provide a constant struggle for dominance over their foes. It ranges from quick 1 on 1 Matches, where different skill configurations can be tested, to huge battles of up to 10 vs 10 players. For those who prefer exploration and are anxious to uncover the story of the world, a multiplayer option is also important as players will need friends to complete the more difficult quests in the game. Once we get up to speed we intend to introduce a Guild system. Being a part of a guild will give players the opportunity to participate in Raids (PvE) and Guild Battles (PvP). The raids will range from epic monster hunts to complex Boss fights with difficult mechanics. The guild battles on the other hand will allow numerous players to trade blows defending the honour of their guild. No-matter what the engagement, our multiplayer system will always bring lots of rewards to all of you.
Social
  The social element in the game is another focal point of the project. The game will use “FB connect” for connecting players and easy communication. We want to offer our players full and engaging social experience. The project will be available online through the dedicated website we are building. Players can either create a new account with the Endemiron project or use their Facebook account via FB connect.

On that note, we have some very interesting ideas about various mechanics through which players will be stimulated to contribute to this growing project. The first one of these ideas is introduced in the Perks.
Art
 
  The art direction of our world is fantasy oriented but with strong Steampunk elements. The story unfolds through various eras - all with distinct looks and art-style. This allows us to blend genres and create internal references. We have many wild ideas about environment, characters, items etc. We want to create an unique atmosphere that will immerse the player in the depth of the experience. For now, things are a bit chaotic in our workshop but that is normal for every creative process. To confront the growing need of artwork we are installing a new “Steampress”. The chief engineer assured us that it will be able to produce an abundance of epic visuals
  The game in Project E starts in a late era where the world gets rebuilt after some major events. This period introduces a technology-meets-magic kind of feeling and is known by the scholars for its early steampunk dominance because magic is no longer working on a massive scale. We try to differ from the rich and luxurious Victorian age that is commonly used in the steampunk culture. Instead, we want to focus on an earlier stage of the steampunk development where things are raw, a lot dirtier, darker and where getting-the-job-done is more important than aesthetics and style.
 
Project E world and stories  
   Epic visuals go hand in hand with cool stories. We have set the scope of our world on a massive scale. We are creating a rich history full of exciting and groundbreaking (sometimes literally) events. Epic battles, cataclysms, enduring heroes and cunning villains inhabit this fairy landscape. The history spans over three different eras and describes the rise and fall of various dynasties. Empires grow and crumble, rulers change, new religions divide the land and brave heroes unite the people. Magic and Spiritualism that once thrived and made obsolete Technology and Pragmatism had waned. Mechanical devices are filling the gap as innovation and practical inventions become the new standard of the world. But with time everything turns to dust or into Legend.
   Knowledge lost, buried deep in forbidden places and forgotten chambers awaits to reemerge and shape the world once more. Remnants of the old and the technology of the present are bound to meet again.
    Our website will feature a Lore Panel that will contain numerous elements revealing portions of the world. There you can find everything from letters, messages and scholar researches to historical records, folk tales and famous legends. They provide one of the ways for you to contribute to the Project (See Perks). Even cryptic clues to the whereabouts of powerful artifacts or weapons may sometimes emerge. The Lore Panel will be updated regularly with new samples from the world.

In the workshop he is the main engineer of the Steampress. He is responsible for giving shape and bringing to life all of our wild ideas. Other great artists that help in time of need are Kalin Georgiev and Miroslav Petrov (Soulsart). Kalin is a designer and conceptualist. He constantly pushes the boundaries of our imagination and pursues an ever bigger scale to make things epic. Miroslav is a veteran in the game industry and his experience as an art director at Masthead Studios is extremely valuable. Some of the awesome art created by our team can be seen on this page.
    Our evergrowing workshop needs constant engineering work. All the miles of copper pipes need to be checked and the pressure maintained throughout the entire installation. For the steam to flow smoothly and the gears to turn in the Steampress we have Boris Angelov to thank to. He does all that heavy IT work and is responsible for network and server support .
    We take really seriously the PR and marketing side of our project. We strongly believe that the success of Project E will depend to great extent on the community of passionate supporters and friends. We would like to involve the players not only in playing the game but in the creation as well. Based on the that the job of the community manager is the hottest seat in the house. And this seat is well reserved for Alexander Grantcharov - our epic PR guru.
   We are constantly looking for good talent to join our cause. So if you want to give us a hand in development or with art, please contact us at  arena@endemiron.com.
Thank you for your time and your support!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

But be warned: the further he pursues the case, the more his own past shall come back to haunt him.And the closer his own sanity will be pushed to the edge.    Featuring:A story-first approach for a dramatic and sublime experience made to linger in your mind years after you've played the game.Simple yet surreal 2D art combined with a cinematic approach to storytelling.A town full of characters with deep backstories, distinct personalities and a whole lot of opinions.An Immersive game world that will pull you in and drench you with its atmosphere and never ending rain.​  As Detective Stone, explore the beautiful town of Pineview, talk to the many locals, interview suspects, dig through the victims' pasts and try to piece together the story of how and why Chris and Diane's lives ended in such a brutal manner.You will observe and investigate suspicious looking objects, solve a few puzzles, get to know your co-workers and settle into the daily rhythm of a small town murder investigation even as your past does its best to throw everything off the rails - and it will if you let it.   But the past is not just a story to be witnessed.You will also play as Chris and experience his story with Diane - joining them in key moments of their lives together as they meet for the first time, get to know each other and fall in love. Beautiful, surreal art style  Your stay in Pineview will be divided into multiple days of investigating various leads, solving a few puzzles and dealing with nightmares, alongside the only co-operative local police officer Blunt. Plan your next move Take notes. Feel like the old man's got motive? Think the local mechanic seems jumpy? Immerse yourself in the investigation and jot down your thoughts in the in-game journal so you can keep a track of all clues!Pay attention, and maybe you could put the pieces together before the story ends.   Experience both sides of the case. Not only do you play as the Detective, but you also get to experience the victims' side of the story first hand as you play through flashback sections.This way, you get to live through the last few months of their life, take part in their story and develop an emotional connection to the characters whose deaths you are trying to make sense of.  Discover different locations.Start your day with a coffee in Mark's cafe before setting off on Market street that connects all of Pineview's major locations you'll be visiting during the investigation.Home to the renowned Pineview festival and often described as 'charming' and 'vibrant', Market street teems with the lives of young and old vendors, shoppers and a chilly breeze.  Atmosphere. Not all of Pineview is equally vibrant though, as the rain continues to take its toll on buildings abandoned to the neglect of insufficient public funding. Water seepage has made the interrogation room inaccessible, Algae covers the hospital walls, all of which adds to the atmosphere and immersion of living in the game world of Pineview. A damp store room temporarily being used for interrogations  CHRISTOPHER GREEN, DIANE MILLER The game is as much about Chris and Diane's lives as it is about their mysterious deaths. Newly moved into town, planning to start a life together in the peaceful neighborhood of Pineview, what could have gone wrong?The police might appear nonchalant and the townsfolk might have much to assume with regards to their reputation, but what really lies beneath is for you to discover. DETECTIVE MICHAEL STONE As a student, Michael was brilliant at everything that he did. An endless thirst for knowledge, a persistent interest in crime fiction and an obsession with the mysteries of the human psyche led him down the Detective route.Despite being a bit brooding, self absorbed and often out of touch with his emotions, Michael is professional, thorough, and the best at what he does. Except, he's not been himself lately.Something's been bothering, even haunting him. In fact, if he gives in, it may stop him from solving the case altogether. OFFICER BLUNT Warm, empathetic and ambitious, local officer Blunt is eager to prove herself as a professional of Pineview's finest. She's also known for fearlessly speaking her mind and her loyalty to the ones she loves.With Detective Stone's sporadic hallucinations and a murder-suicide to deal with however, she might just have more on her hands than bargained for. THE TOWNSFOLK""It was just a matter of time.""""They never really got out much, you know?""""They cut themselves off from the community.""""They would argue ALL the time, the things that I've heard...""The people of Pineview are a source of information, stories and gossip. Not all of it is relevant to the case, and much of it is inaccurate. Their version of events might just be the one they'd rather believe - but does that make them wrong?   Rainswept's visual style prioritizes a cinematic experience through the use of closeups and smooth camera movements, which work together with the simple art style to create a unique look during cutscenes.                        Another aspect that helps the style of the game is the lighting. A simple shift in colors through layers of gradients helps to create different conditions - from misty hills to valleys bathed in the glow of the setting sun.  Adding parallax to this gives an almost dynamic look to the lighting, and adds depth to the game world.                                 Fundamental to the experience, Rainswept's soundtrack has been designed to aid the game in achieving its goal - to move and impact the player emotionally.Just like the game, the music covers an expanse of emotions, and is dripping with atmosphere. It's also pretty good to put on and listen to by itself!
The soundtrack is being composed by micAmic, the composer behind Harvester Games’ 2012 sentimental epic The Cat Lady  Here's a preview.
 

 
                                                                                      From impractically dreaming of becoming a game developer to giving up on that dream a decade ago in favor of architecture, film making and eventually returning to video games, I've been looking for the right medium to express and share beauty with the world.To convey the indescribable in a form that, if not understood, can at least be felt. Thanks to the way the indie game development scene has developed over the past decade, the original dream is finally within reach!It has become my life's purpose to create art that moves people; hopefully Rainswept is the first step in achieving that dream. Besides being involved in the founding of brother Rem Michalski's Polish independent games studio Harvester Games himself, Michal alias micAmic has also served as the chief music composer to all of its major titles.This being of course the trilogy of The Cat Lady, Downfall - A Horror Adventure Game and the highly anticipated Lorelai.  Rainswept is scheduled for a January 2019 PC, Mac and Linux release on Steam, Itch and Gamejolt. The game is complete in terms of its gameplay and story, and is playable from start to end.Now however it’s time for me to plug in the holes by:
Completing missing scenes, levels, dialogues and other accessories to make the game world feel even more alive,
Polishing various aspects of writing, animations, graphics, user interface,
Testing for quality assurance.While other localization oriented tasks will follow.This guarantees that the project will be completed and released as per the following schedule, while also allowing for me to ensure maximum quality.The demo released in January 2018 was positively received and hopefully, something similar awaits a full year later.FOLLOW ALONG  Originally planned for August 2018, the release date was pushed back so that I could really make sure the entire experience was great and not just playable.Funding from Indiegogo, with your help, gives me the time to continue working on the game for this period by helping with rent, food and general costs of living, and will also enable the purchase of necessary sound and visual assets.   DESCRIPTION MAKING OF RAINSWEPT DIGITAL ART BOOK (TIER $25 AND ABOVE)The Art Book provides insight into the development of Rainswept's cinematic scenes, characters and locations by describing my thought processes, motivations and inspirations behind each.  A mock-up of the art book - the final thing will look cooler! CHARACTER WITH YOUR NAME, APPEARANCE AND PERSONALITY (TIER $400) Your chance to be a Pineview resident!I'll design an NPC, or a non-playable character with your name, physical appearance and personality that can also be interacted with while exploring the town! Not just that, but your character will also have dialogues scripted for each in-game day.Whether you'll aid the detective or confuse players will completely depend on you, as your character will be based on personality tests, discussions with you and a survey with questions regarding how you'd react to different situations in the game!  So what led me from Architecture to developing a video game?I've been trying to understand beauty ever since I caught glimpse of a few mist covered mountains during a railway journey.Those mountains left an impression. I was 15, and I realized I wanted to give my life to seeking, creating and understanding beauty. Over time I came to realize that making art was essential to this search of mine, but turning it into a career path was something I still had to figure out.I ended up in Architecture school despite not wanting to be an architect and completed my education regardless, all the while mulling over what I really wanted to do.Any childhood dreams of entering the game industry had been long abandoned; financial issues and the lack of local industry presence made the idea impractical.  During architecture school, I discovered and fell in love with films. But as I entered the film industry upon graduation and started working on a few projects, I learnt that while I loved film making as a medium of storytelling -- I hated the process.I realized that I was happiest working indoors, on a desk, in front of a screen, preferably with a small team or even alone. Somewhere I could sit and think in silence. I still wanted to tell stories and move people emotionally, but the medium wasn't right - I had to look again.I took a year off from this search and landed myself a nine-to-five job in Architecture as I attempted to re-calibrate. The job was temporary, intended to give me time to stabilize myself as I tried to plan out my next move. This was when a friend of mine suggested game development; where I'd have normally dismissed the idea as I had done in the past, things were different now.Game development had grown accessible to the world as barriers to entry had dropped. Besides turning out to be the perfect medium of self expression for me, I now had a background in film and architecture to exploit.Just through the process of working on Rainswept, I feel I have already achieved a part of my dream. Now it's time to share it with the world. REFERENCES Early concept art for Rainswept While Twin Peaks and other TV shows of the Police Procedural and Nordic Noir genres act as obvious inspirations, Rainswept primarily derives from South Korean crime thrillers in its overall mood and emotion. This isn't just a murder mystery - but a story about life, love, beauty, suffering and meaning.  It's about how other people impact our lives, and whether we have any control over who we become once they're gone.My aim with Rainswept is to create something that affects players, moves them emotionally  and hopefully, stays with them years later. Something cathartic.That is what the best games, movies, books and music have done for me, and that's what I've always wanted to do for others.  The main challenge is that I'm working on Rainswept relatively alone and a delay in release is always likely.That said, living frugally in a place with a low cost of living has helped avert a lot of the financial risks, while a successful demo release has made me aware of the game development and publishing process.Also as mentioned previously, most of the game has already been developed apart from addressing minor issues, additional content and polish.

The gameplay and game balance will not be final. We're currently at the Beta Testing stage. Over the next few months, we intend to enter a 3 month balancing period on Steam Early Access. During this period, we will release new characters and maps for players to test out and provide feedback.

<p>My group consists out of a<b> young team</b> of
developers from different parts of the world. Such as Germany and New Zealand,
where I have met likeminded individuals who have the same passion for this industry

<p>Anton Rothe is the level designer on project Twodi
and focuses on building the different worlds and lands that have never heard or

project?</b><br/></p>
<p></p><p>For years now, I've been wanting to play a
game that simulates giant robot and giant monster combat, with certain
strategic elements that allows for either 'commander' or
'pilot' playstyles. I've enjoyed certain video games and movies, but
always there seemed to be something missing.</p>
<p>This isn't that unusual a desire. I know
others feel that missing niche too, since I've seen and been
inspired by a free RPG system that have been developed to allow
players to take the role of giant robot pilots or a base commander. And in a
funny bit of recursion, I've also been credited a bit by those cool guys for previously
having<i> inspired them</i> to create the game system through a
story I've written.</p>
<p>The tacticle fun of a board or
tabletop game, competing against another person, it's definitely a different
experience to a video game. However, it is also well-known that war gaming
tends to become an expensive hobby very quickly. </p>
<p>No one offered exactly what I was looking
for anyway.</p>
<p>I wanted something simple enough that I
could play with my little brother straight out of the box. At the same time, in
respect to the titanic scale, something that could still play out as tense scenarios or
epic campaigns. Expensive and painstakingly painted pieces like most gaming miniatures may deter carefee play. </p>
<p>If it doesn't exist, why can't I just make it myself? Why wait in vain?<br/></p><p>Creating such a game, for quite some time now, seemed as a laughable
impossibility - it takes a big company and high-performing team to bring out a
board game. It didn't matter how much I itched under my skin for that specific
kind of game.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Research however has shown me that in the
end what it takes is dedication, bravery, and a lot of hard work. Just waiting
for something to happen is not enough anymore. I had thought it was
necessary to save up years ahead for massive capital, but it turns out that trying to
do it alone is the wrong way to go.</span><br/></p><p>So I saved up and  assembled a team that can do this. Already our 3D modeling and printing method is proving to be faster and cheaper than miniature sculpting and casting. We are sufficiently funded for the first few prototypes, but help is needed.<br/></p>

It
is the strength of humanity to help each other, and in that spirit please help
me create this game of <strong>titanic
combat and human survival</strong>.<p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/270969/files/20131220021948-2cards.jpg?1387534788"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What will you do with the money pledged to this project?</h3><p>Creating a custom game from scratch takes a lot of time, money and effort.

Game assets will be drawn, designed and crafted even during the crowdfunding period. In effect, we are asking for funds to cover the <em>debt </em>incurred through pre-production.</p><blockquote>
<p>4.     Then setting up a website and online store to showcase the game and the rich setting behind it, customer support, and a forum for community interaction;<br/>5.  Doing business with a local toy manufacturer to turn the models into high-detail hard plastic game pieces, printing out of the game materials, and packaging for the box set;<br/>6.  - and international shipping costs.

<li>The Base, likely made of thick hard plastic or resin, or even magnetic- two 25mm discs under each foot.</li>
<li>The Legs, with different poses and types that hint at the movement speed of the unit</li>
<li>The Torso, which is the most important item for the aesthetics of that unit, whether it’s meant for speed, resilience, or special abilities</li>
<li>The Arms, which have weapons and allow for attacks and additional movement options (climbing on top of buildings, for example)</li>
<li>The Face, which further differentiate each (Type)Titan and confer sensory abilities</li>
<li>Back and Shoulder assemblies, which represent more weapons or equipment. Wings, extra arms, etc, for VoidTitans.</li>
</ol><p>Each section serves a purpose, and it is possible to highly customize and personalize each unit. Differences in layout and abilities also give advantages and disadvantages. As more models become available, unique tactical opportunities present themselves.</p><p>              <img alt=""vtspn"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-341 lazy"" data-src=""http://ttsb.eu.pn/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vtspn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>But what if you get even MORE?</h3><p>It would be awesome if the project gains at least <strong>$5000</strong>, since that would allow us to be free of worries about  this project over the next few months and devote all our time to giving you the best possible value for your funding. </p><p>It will go towards the purchase of a 3D printer just for this game, which will <em><strong>significantly</strong> </em>increase the efficiency  of design and production.</p><p>But enhancing the environment and promoting different playstyles will be the main focus of this unlocked funding goal.</p><p></p><ul>

<p></p></div>","I have a dream. It is a dream of giants, of metal and men and the incomprehensible monstrous alien, clashing with such force that sky itself screams.Buildings shudder, and the earth itself thunders with their footsteps. Man-made sunfire lashes out from above. There is a strange, flowery smell in the middle of such chaos. A wet tide of purple ichor slaps against armored walls.I dream - as if I were a mere soldier, standing in the shadow of monsters from beyond the stars, sweating in terror, but at the same time full of hope as man-made gods rampage. I look up, and up, and bare my teeth as titanium slams upon chitin. I dream of a legend being written before my eyes. I close my eyes and reach for that feeling, as I stand here in this dense and smoky city. Of a titanic clash of 'natural philosophies' rendered to its purest and most violent form*.
 *giant robots and giant monsters punching the heck out of each other. An epic adventure about savage new steel pantheons:Out of the cold dark Void came strange spawns from strange suns, here to wage war upon the little beings for simply daring to exist. Man, long basking by his uncontested dominance open his lonely planet, was shaken from his complacence.And shouts of rage and despair rose with the radioactive winds.  But though the Voidborn were powerful, they were not completely invincible. When all hope seemed lost, The Betrayer gave humanity the understanding about how to battle its own kind. The woven threads of spacetime were shattered by the collective psychic screams of billions, but the invaders were only temporarily stymied.Dream with me now, of a desperate time, of two and a half decades spent by a broken but yet unbeaten mankind, in nothing but preparation.In feral expectation.For the stars will yet be right again, and the broken threads be as one again, and alien skies will overlap the azure blue.And gargantuan alien horrors, they return.But now mankind possesses weapons that can fight them. Titanic war machines, designed to battle the Enemy on their own terms, to turn the enemy's terrible power upon themselves.New stars are in the sky.
 
The siege has
begun.
This is What is it, really?Concept: Epic scale figures on a destructible cityscape.It is supposed to be a
tactical combat game involving differently-sized game pieces, from epically
large 4"" giant figurines to 25mm conventional forces. It is a
game that mixes intense tactical action and deep strategic choices.
Imagine individualized Titan
pieces fighting on the field. Imagine stackable buildings that not
only provide physical barriers but also may hide weapons turrets, resupply
points, or civilians that need rescue. Imagine sheer customizability that
makes each game unique, and adaptive rules for different custom scenarios -
from brutal skirmishes to complex story-laden campaigns.
The gameplay is simple and
straightforward, with very minimal dice-rolling and sheet-checking. Imagine
encapsulating a desperate struggle for survival within an hour of fun and
exciting play.What’s inside the game?The planned components of a Basic TechTitan SiegeBattles Boxed Set are:
a) 3x 3″ tall TechTitan game pieces
b) 3x 3″ tall VoidTitan game pieces
c) 10x 42mm Infantry (Tech and Void) game pieces
d) 6x 42mm Tank (Tech and Void) game pieces
e) 6x Civilian and Pilot game pieces
f) 36x stackable Building Structure pieces
g) 6x Hidden Structures (4x Weapon Turret, 2x Supply)
h) 24x Action, Person, and Data cards
i) 1x printed Quick Rules
i) 1x CD with Game Manual and Literature
j) 6x City Combat game board (8 x 8 1.5″ grid)
k) data sheets and supplemental materials
- and hours upon hours of fun.Features!
►Epic combat of titanic proportions.
►Many detailed game figures in different sizes, with different capabilities, all significant to the game. Soldiers and civilians move in the shadow of giants.► Stackable building sets providing a realistic and destructible environment. ► Game mats allow for custom play areas and huge cityscapes.► Tactical layer provided by turn-based movement but simultaneous actions, embellished by action cards.► Strategic layer provided by factors of research, rebuilding, and morale between battles. Scenarios and campaigns provide hours of play.► Easy, out-of-the-box rules of play. No tedious dice rolling actually needed.► Artistic and durable miniature pieces that are also great as diorama pieces, for storytelling, or as action figures.________Prototype pieces:Note 1.5"" wide game area tiles and figurine bases.(admittedly, we are not very good at painting)________Stampede across an expansive cityscape formed by eight 8×8 grid game mats.Super New Year bonus:What's a giant monster-fighting robot setting without a kaiju rising from the depths?The Basic Set's 8 8x8 game mats will be increased to 10, with two dockyard maps.The Complete Box Set will have four dockyard mats, increasing 8x8 mats to 14.GameplayTechTitan SiegeBattles is designed to be played straight out of the box. You don’t even need to look at the manual.You have squishy humans and slightly less squishy tanks and turrets. You have a cityscape with buildings that can fall down. You have teams of Giant Robots and Giant Alien Monsters. Heck, you don’t need rules. Let your inner child free and go ‘Braap!’, ‘Pow!’, and ‘Wham!’ and send pieces crashing into each other.But for an actual game pitting alien attackers against human defenders, you only need to remember three things.

1. All units have Movement Points that can be used to move through the battle grid or be consumed as an Action. 


2. Action Cards represent attacks, tactics, powers and events; how they’re meant to be used is already printed on them. Person and Data Cards tell you everything else you need to know.


3. If you end the turn with Movement Points left, you can counter your opponent’s Actions during their turn with your own Action Cards.

||All Action Cards consume only one Move PointThat’s it. No need to look up tables and weapon lists, no need to keep checking the rulebook, no confusion about what decisions to make. TechTitans SiegeBattles tries to minimize note-taking and reference-checking as much as possible, unless you’re playing the Tactical and Strategic Layers. Then, you will be able to undertake Logistics, Research, and Resource Management for a simulationist style of play. Scenarios can be played individually, or chained into a tense campaign through pivotal moments in the history of humanity's Wars Against the Voidborn.Production MethodThe game figures are designed as  3D computer models then 3D-printed into prototype game pieces.  Why did you choose crowdfunding for this
project?
For years now, I've been wanting to play a
game that simulates giant robot and giant monster combat, with certain
strategic elements that allows for either 'commander' or
'pilot' playstyles. I've enjoyed certain video games and movies, but
always there seemed to be something missing.
This isn't that unusual a desire. I know
others feel that missing niche too, since I've seen and been
inspired by a free RPG system that have been developed to allow
players to take the role of giant robot pilots or a base commander. And in a
funny bit of recursion, I've also been credited a bit by those cool guys for previously
having inspired them to create the game system through a
story I've written.
The tacticle fun of a board or
tabletop game, competing against another person, it's definitely a different
experience to a video game. However, it is also well-known that war gaming
tends to become an expensive hobby very quickly. 
No one offered exactly what I was looking
for anyway.
I wanted something simple enough that I
could play with my little brother straight out of the box. At the same time, in
respect to the titanic scale, something that could still play out as tense scenarios or
epic campaigns. Expensive and painstakingly painted pieces like most gaming miniatures may deter carefee play. 
If it doesn't exist, why can't I just make it myself? Why wait in vain?Creating such a game, for quite some time now, seemed as a laughable
impossibility - it takes a big company and high-performing team to bring out a
board game. It didn't matter how much I itched under my skin for that specific
kind of game.
Research however has shown me that in the
end what it takes is dedication, bravery, and a lot of hard work. Just waiting
for something to happen is not enough anymore. I had thought it was
necessary to save up years ahead for massive capital, but it turns out that trying to
do it alone is the wrong way to go.So I saved up and  assembled a team that can do this. Already our 3D modeling and printing method is proving to be faster and cheaper than miniature sculpting and casting. We are sufficiently funded for the first few prototypes, but help is needed.

It
is the strength of humanity to help each other, and in that spirit please help
me create this game of titanic
combat and human survival.What will you do with the money pledged to this project?Creating a custom game from scratch takes a lot of time, money and effort. What you give will be used only for:1.  Actual production of the game, involving miniature sculpting. computer modeling, 3d printing, duplication, etc.’2.     Contracts with artists, writers, and web developers to help in the creation and distribution of the game;3.  Registration and Distribution;These will likely take up most of the donated funds. Game assets will be drawn, designed and crafted even during the crowdfunding period. In effect, we are asking for funds to cover the debt incurred through pre-production.
4.     Then setting up a website and online store to showcase the game and the rich setting behind it, customer support, and a forum for community interaction;5.  Doing business with a local toy manufacturer to turn the models into high-detail hard plastic game pieces, printing out of the game materials, and packaging for the box set;6.  - and international shipping costs. It may even be necessary to have someone serve as a distributor in the US because of severely punishing postage. Fortunately I’ve got a friend who can handle that.

How much do you need?$3500 should be enough to create prototypes and deliver a first production run for play-testing and further refinement. Then, after receiving feedback, time to go full production using a small business loan.
What will I get for my pledge?

$ 5 – Civilian
A personal thank-you note through email, listing in the acknowledgment section of the manual, and early access to the tie-in interactive novel.$ 25 – ObserverA thank-you note through the email, a pdf copy of the rulebook, a pdf copy of the short story collection, and a random TechTitan or VoidTitan Data Card.$ 50 – BattlerAll previously noted perks, and the City Encounter Diorama Pack containing1 random Tech Titan figure1 random VoidTitan figure2 Tech or Void -Infantry pieces2 Tech or Void -Tank pieces12 stackable Dummy Building units2 random Armament Buildings1 6 by 6″ Broken City terrain mat.$ 80 – TacticianThe TechTitan SiegeBattles Starter Box containing3 Tech Titan figures3 VoidTitan figures8 Tech and Void Infantry pieces4 Tech and Void Tank pieces4 Civilian pieces36 stackable Dummy Building units8 Armament Buildings (2x Gun, Beam, Missile and 1x  Recharge and Resupply)4 8 x 8 grid Game Mats3 Person Cards6 Data Cards12 Action Cards1 CD containing the PDF copy of the full rulebook, the lorebook, concept art, and supplemental materials$ 120 – StrategistThe TechTitan SiegeBattles Expanded Box containing4 Tech Titan figures6 VoidTitan figures10 Tech and Void Infantry pieces6 Tech and Void Tank pieces2 Pilot pieces60 stackable Dummy Building units6 stackable Large Structure units2 Bunker Building units15 Armament Buildings (3x Gun, Beam, Missile and 3x  Recharge and Resupply)3 8 x 16 grid Game Mats6 Person Cards12 Data Cards24 Action Cards1 Expanded Rules booklet1 CD containing the PDF copy of the full rulebook, the lorebook, concept art, and supplemental materialsYour forces stand ready, Commander.There are two main possible complications to the production of the game:1) Running out of funding to produce the many game pieces or ship the box sets internationally, 2) Delays in shipping due to failing to meet art production deadlines.Don’t worry! Even as you read this, we’re continually working to produce the game itself out of my own pocket. The figurines and play materials are already being prototyped.Regardless of the funding level, rest assured that if you pledged to receive a full game then you’ll get it. Even if we have to send hand-crafted figurines and game boards with the parcels, you will have what was promised. While we are sufficiently funded to produce the game pieces; be it the figurines, terrain blocks, and the game mats; sizable outlay of time and money are still required for various artwork and literature. In this instance we are actually at the mercy of our contracted artists when it comes to finishing the game cards and the manual. However, those who provide their email and shipping address are due free updated editions of the game manual and lorebook in PDF format. We will not be shipping the manuals as printed editions due to how much a book weighs and the volume it eats up in a box set. That’s good to hear, but what if you manage to receive over what this project needs?Reaching and going over $4000 will see upgraded perks to everyone who pledged. Those who gave $10 will get a pdf copy of the game rules and a random TechTitan or VoidTitan data card. Those who gave $25 will get the rulebook in paperback, a random Data Card,  and a Solo Diorama Set with:1 random TechTitan or VoidTitan figurine12 stackable Buildings1 5 x 5 (8″) Ruined City mat Those who gave $50 will get as above, and the City Encounter Diorama turns into the Encounter Play Pack.It will
come with three Tech and Void Titan pieces each; two fighting, one destroyed (random
Tech or Void unit). In addition, the Set comes with 16 stackable Dummy
Building pieces, 2 Armament buildings, 4 Infantry, 2 Tank, and 2
Civilian pieces – a set suitable for a quick skirmish or roleplaying.
Those who pre-ordered the $80 Starter Box Set will have all four of the TechTitan chassis types, and all six of the VoidTitan, 2 new Infantry and Tank models for Tech and Void players, and more Building sets inside. In effect, becoming The Complete Box Set.Those who donated $120 or more for The Expanded Box will have all previous Perk upgrades,  and more pieces for a total war experience. Plus a special SiegeBattles poster, expanded campaign rules, two more environment game mats – Lost Hills and Winter War, and a Base Commander figurine!I really want this to be a game that you and your family and friends may enjoy for a long time. If the pledges manage to reach $4500, we will go into The Megascale Game. Instead of 3″ tall figures on 1.5″ base, they become highly detailed epic 4″ tall figures.  All of them meticulously painted and posed.Customization! They can now be assembled and customized to suit your playstyle or overarching strategic plot you may want to weave through the campaign.
The game board will become a tactical hex grid instead of just a square grid.

  A special new unit – the Land Dreadnought; a purely mechanical combat platform that relies on brute strength and armor instead of the exotic powers of Tech and Void Titans.
 More terrain options, including a mountain set, beach assault, and even on the back of aliens god-beasts of truly colossal scale. More artistic detail on everything! From the buildings, to play figures, to the game board, we will provide an even more photogenic play area. Campaign options expand even more, allowing you to play different factions and craft the metaplot. Human against human and alien against alien play is improved.Four inches tall? Those are unusually large figurines for a board game. Tell me more.They have features more than just size! Each individual TechTitan or VoidTitan would also be composed of several sections:
The Base, likely made of thick hard plastic or resin, or even magnetic- two 25mm discs under each foot.
The Legs, with different poses and types that hint at the movement speed of the unit
The Torso, which is the most important item for the aesthetics of that unit, whether it’s meant for speed, resilience, or special abilities
The Arms, which have weapons and allow for attacks and additional movement options (climbing on top of buildings, for example)
The Face, which further differentiate each (Type)Titan and confer sensory abilities
Back and Shoulder assemblies, which represent more weapons or equipment. Wings, extra arms, etc, for VoidTitans.
Each section serves a purpose, and it is possible to highly customize and personalize each unit. Differences in layout and abilities also give advantages and disadvantages. As more models become available, unique tactical opportunities present themselves.              But what if you get even MORE?It would be awesome if the project gains at least $5000, since that would allow us to be free of worries about  this project over the next few months and devote all our time to giving you the best possible value for your funding. It will go towards the purchase of a 3D printer just for this game, which will significantly increase the efficiency  of design and production.But enhancing the environment and promoting different playstyles will be the main focus of this unlocked funding goal.

The buildings and units become unique to three different zones – Heartlands (plains, US industrial theme), Cloudhome (mountains, Incatech theme), and Vanaheim (snow, European War theme). More types of terrain with different height levels for a true tactical map experience.


We will provide modular components for Massive Structures that can be used to create an unlimited variety of scenes.


VoidTitans also gain new features, units, and abilities. They will have their own buildings that can be dropped to quickly terraform the area to their advantage. A new map, Inside The Beast, will become available.  It’s a campaign goal wherein a team of the most veteran TechTitan pilots and machines attempt to put an end to the extinction-level threat of a Maker-Titan, and its endless spawning of Void-Titans.But there are three such behemoths laying siege to the world. This massive creature is its own battle map.

What if I don’t feel like playing a war game?Hey, no problem! The pieces of TechTitan SiegeBattles are good enough in themselves as toys or for display as a diorama. You could pledge just to get the game pieces, the special art cards, the story collection or comic books.TechTitan SiegeBattles is a great gift idea too. Game items that can be mailed as printed material have less shipping requirements and may arrive much earlier. Sounds good! How much should I give?By pledging $80 or $120, you are in effect pre-ordering the full game. This already includes international shipping costs to anywhere in the world. You get the benefit of free updates and shipping of the more refined next generation of play figurines free of charge.Any help you could give would be much appreciated, but please consider at least $10; that’s how much it to costs to create each figurine prior to mass production.When can I expect the actual game?The earliest that the game is expected to be commercially produced is two months after this project ends. In this instance, Feb 18. Therefore, we set our sights on April 30th. Additional elements such as music, promotional materials, special rewards and such, may take longer to arrive.If you would prefer, you may also receive the game earlier as individual components (figurines, game boards, books, etc.) instead of the ‘boxed set’. Parcel delivery costs may require further action, however.Can I still help without giving money?Of course! Any help at all would be very much appreciated.Please share this crowdfunding project to those you know who might be interested. Post this project on your facebook or blog, if you would be so kind.Leaving comments and advice about producing game components would also be very useful.

<h3>What Makes This Game a ""Must""</h3>
<p>No honey bees, no more Almond Joy candy bars. No more Hagen Das Strawberry Ice Cream. No more Burt’s Bees lip balm. No more apples, peaches, raspberries, blueberries, watermelon, pumpkins. How much more do you know about honey bees? I created a board game to teach kids &amp; adults about the importance of honey bees.</p>
<p>if enough people learn what they can do to restore healthy honey bee habitat, we  can rejuvenate honey bee populations. Then we can all bite into our favorite fruit or vegetables for decades to come.</p>
<p>I live in Philadelphia, PA where there is a vibrant urban beekeeping community. I teach beginners beekeeping to children &amp; adults. Bee Green Philly.com, my informational blog on urban &amp; international beekeeping, reaches 300,000 visitors a year. </p>
<p>Honey bees are in serious trouble, and urban beekeepers are helping honey bees from becoming extinct. Cities are less toxic to honey bees. In rural areas,  bees may be forced to forage on monoculture crops and toxic habitat. Since honey bees pollinate one-third of our food crops, keeping honey bees alive is in everyone’s best interest. With me so far?</p>
<p>35 states in the U.S. are losing honey bees! Many honey bee problems have been caused or are amplified by human creating eco-system imbalances for all of our pollinators. Through education, we can be part of solving the challenges that will threaten global food security. No bee = less food, less food = more global strife and suffering. Visualize World Peace, Visualize World Bees!</p>
<p>Let's make protecting our food system pollinators as easy as learning how to recycle. This game can be as effective in educating kids &amp; adults about what we can all do to protect our honey bees.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your contribution to my goal of $40,000 (after IndieGoGo's fees) gets Visualize World Bees game and study guide published, packed up &amp; shipped to schools along with a ‘meadow in a box’ resource. With 35 states in the U.S. alone losing honey bees, year after year, there’s no time to waste. This money will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addiitonal beta testing &amp; development</li>
<li>A graphic artist to finalize game design with specs for game manufacturer</li>
<li>Translating the game &amp; all materials into: French, German, Italian &amp; Spanish</li>
<li>Setting up online content delivery platform including Smart Board capacity for teaching to students/classes all over the world</li>
<li>manufacturing board game samples; publishing study guides</li>
<li>Packaging my “<em>meadow in a box”</em> companion resource; this is an organic seeds pollination kit for planting variety of bee-friendly plants as community/school projects</li>
<li>attending targeted trade shows 2013 &amp; 2014</li>
<li>Introduce Visualize World Bees board game and the study guide into schools and youth learning environments</li>
<li>6,000 manufactured games ready to distribute for a national promotion during National Pollinators Week in June of 2013</li>
<li>Connecting local beekeepers and beekeeping groups with Visualize World Bees gaming community</li>
<li>A traveling exhibition for the Envision Peace Museum</li>
<li>Development of a Visualize World Bees phone app for 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don’t reach the goal of $40,000 in 45 days, any funds contributed will be used to support the game developmt goals listed above. I am great at parsing out pennies! If the goal is surpassed, 5% will be donated to a program that supports beekeeping as a micro-economic enterprise.</p>
<p>I’m offering some cool perks! Here are just a few: A lanyard usb flash drive filled with information about honey bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, and how to BeeCome a Pollination Super Hero! You can also receive a collector’s version of Visualize World Bees with your face on one of the beekeeper tokens.  Or you can get a meadow in a box and start something wild in your community!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact? Global!</h3>
<p>Kids learn so much through play!</p>
<p>Visualize World Bees is fun to play and the concept is simple: How do we restore healthy honey bee habitat in order to ensure 1/3 of our global food supply for 7-9 billion people?</p>
<p>When it comes to making a difference on an important environmental concern, the impact of public educatiion is enormous! Can you remember a time when recycling wasn’t a part of daily life? Probably not. By distributing this game, the study guide, and the meadow in a box  into the world’s classrooms, someday soon we be able to ask: “Remember the time when honey bees were endangered of becoming extincT?"" and our children's children say: ""No, I don't remember that.""</p>
<p>That's the win! That's what this campaign is all about!</p>
<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>
<p>Kids learn cooperation over competition; competitive energ is channeled into solving a problem rather than besting a fellow player. No one wins until everyone wins.</p>
<p>Players restore toxic honey bee habitat to healthy habitat on their given section of the game board. Every player must reveal a Queen Bee with the image 1 Billion on its flip side. This is the equivalent of feeding 1 Billion People. Every player has to have one of these queens on his section of the board. Players are encouraged to share resources.</p>
<p>Using our study guide, this game is a teaching tool. Visualize World Bees is a fun way to learn about honey bees on family game night -- you have to be able to answer the questions correctly to move the game along. This game does not teach violence to children. Instead, it's a game that enhances language, science, math, creativity and team-building skills. I think that's pretty cool and I hope you do, too.</p>
<p>Kids who have played Visualize World Bees say two things: I love this game! When can I buy this gamE</p>
<p>You discover more about the game on our YouTube channel.</p>
<h3>Can I make this happen? You bet!</h3>
<p>As the executive director of a small non-profit, my track record includes successful collaborations with several local community partners; Interim House, Inc., Awbury Arboretum, Project Learn School, helping to launch a an urban farm, a community apiary, a beekeeping program, and the launch of the Philadelphia Beekeepers Guild annual Langstroth Honey Festival.</p>
<p>My past professional experience includes a staff position with Congressman, now Senator Bernard Sanders, I-VT. Organizing on his behalf, I managed door-knock blitzes for over 4,000 households and set up a GOTV office, so I learned a great deal about how to get things done, make a difference in my community and have fun doing it! As publicity and marketing manager for a major publishing house, I booked public speaking, TV &amp;  radio appearances for numerous authors of travel &amp; lifestyle books. I'm comfortable with public speaking. I've been a guest on numerous radio talk shows, presented at conferences, led workshops, &amp; facilitated retreats. I'm not shy about spreading excitement &amp; a great idea!</p>
<p>I don’t want to overwhelm you with talking points! Let’s just say I’m a tireless worker bee. I love teaching kids about honey bees, helping everyone be less fearful of bees, and sharing the benefits we receive from having honey bee in the world.</p>
</div>
<div>

With me so far?
35 states in the U.S. are losing honey bees! Many honey bee problems have been caused or are amplified by human creating eco-system imbalances for all of our pollinators. Through education, we can be part of solving the challenges that will threaten global food security. No bee = less food, less food = more global strife and suffering. Visualize World Peace, Visualize World Bees!
Let's make protecting our food system pollinators as easy as learning how to recycle. This game can be as effective in educating kids & adults about what we can all do to protect our honey bees.
What We Need & What You Get


Your contribution to my goal of $40,000 (after IndieGoGo's fees) gets Visualize World Bees game and study guide published, packed up & shipped to schools along with a ‘meadow in a box’ resource. With 35 states in the U.S. alone losing honey bees, year after year, there’s no time to waste. This money will pay for:

Addiitonal beta testing & development
A graphic artist to finalize game design with specs for game manufacturer
Translating the game & all materials into: French, German, Italian & Spanish
Setting up online content delivery platform including Smart Board capacity for teaching to students/classes all over the world
manufacturing board game samples; publishing study guides
Packaging my “meadow in a box” companion resource; this is an organic seeds pollination kit for planting variety of bee-friendly plants as community/school projects
attending targeted trade shows 2013 & 2014
Introduce Visualize World Bees board game and the study guide into schools and youth learning environments
6,000 manufactured games ready to distribute for a national promotion during National Pollinators Week in June of 2013
Connecting local beekeepers and beekeeping groups with Visualize World Bees gaming community
A traveling exhibition for the Envision Peace Museum
Development of a Visualize World Bees phone app for 2014

If I don’t reach the goal of $40,000 in 45 days, any funds contributed will be used to support the game developmt goals listed above. I am great at parsing out pennies! If the goal is surpassed, 5% will be donated to a program that supports beekeeping as a micro-economic enterprise.
I’m offering some cool perks! Here are just a few: A lanyard usb flash drive filled with information about honey bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, and how to BeeCome a Pollination Super Hero! You can also receive a collector’s version of Visualize World Bees with your face on one of the beekeeper tokens.  Or you can get a meadow in a box and start something wild in your community!


The Impact? Global!
Kids learn so much through play!
Visualize World Bees is fun to play and the concept is simple: How do we restore healthy honey bee habitat in order to ensure 1/3 of our global food supply for 7-9 billion people?
When it comes to making a difference on an important environmental concern, the impact of public educatiion is enormous! Can you remember a time when recycling wasn’t a part of daily life? Probably not. By distributing this game, the study guide, and the meadow in a box  into the world’s classrooms, someday soon we be able to ask: “Remember the time when honey bees were endangered of becoming extincT?"" and our children's children say: ""No, I don't remember that.""
That's the win! That's what this campaign is all about!
The Game
Kids learn cooperation over competition; competitive energ is channeled into solving a problem rather than besting a fellow player. No one wins until everyone wins.
Players restore toxic honey bee habitat to healthy habitat on their given section of the game board. Every player must reveal a Queen Bee with the image 1 Billion on its flip side. This is the equivalent of feeding 1 Billion People. Every player has to have one of these queens on his section of the board. Players are encouraged to share resources.
Using our study guide, this game is a teaching tool. Visualize World Bees is a fun way to learn about honey bees on family game night -- you have to be able to answer the questions correctly to move the game along. This game does not teach violence to children. Instead, it's a game that enhances language, science, math, creativity and team-building skills. I think that's pretty cool and I hope you do, too.
Kids who have played Visualize World Bees say two things: I love this game! When can I buy this gamE
You discover more about the game on our YouTube channel.
Can I make this happen? You bet!
As the executive director of a small non-profit, my track record includes successful collaborations with several local community partners; Interim House, Inc., Awbury Arboretum, Project Learn School, helping to launch a an urban farm, a community apiary, a beekeeping program, and the launch of the Philadelphia Beekeepers Guild annual Langstroth Honey Festival.
My past professional experience includes a staff position with Congressman, now Senator Bernard Sanders, I-VT. Organizing on his behalf, I managed door-knock blitzes for over 4,000 households and set up a GOTV office, so I learned a great deal about how to get things done, make a difference in my community and have fun doing it! As publicity and marketing manager for a major publishing house, I booked public speaking, TV &  radio appearances for numerous authors of travel & lifestyle books. I'm comfortable with public speaking. I've been a guest on numerous radio talk shows, presented at conferences, led workshops, & facilitated retreats. I'm not shy about spreading excitement & a great idea!
I don’t want to overwhelm you with talking points! Let’s just say I’m a tireless worker bee. I love teaching kids about honey bees, helping everyone be less fearful of bees, and sharing the benefits we receive from having honey bee in the world.

In RIOT the player has to choose a side and rule the streets of the city maintainig control of different areas in a situation that is out of any control. This campaign concludes 12 months of hard work,
 imagination, research and testing with 4 different prototypes - bringing into life a dream we were 
chasing - a board game that could talk about reality in a time of crisis and increasing social conflict. 
Your support will help us to make this dream reality and in exchange, you will be the first to enjoy it.Our Goal is to produce the first copies of the game for the lowest price possible, so that anyone can afford it. We also want to improve the Artwork and the graphics with the help of an illustrator (everything will be renewed except our great logo).At the same time we want to create a 4 players option for the game (See Survey section for details) To do so we need € 3.500 that we'll spend this way:Inside the game's box you will find:

1 board

1 rulebook (ENG - ITA)
148 playing cards divided in 9 different decks
135 cardboard circular tokens 

4 player's resume boards
2 plastic miniatures
2 plastic points markers

RIOT uses several board game mechanics which contribute to the games strategical aspect and replay value.



Resource management - the resources are constantly 
collected by players and can be spent in many different ways, according to the players' strategy
Units variety - every side has 4 different units to deploy + 2 special characters, each one with different features


Bonus based combat system - we want to keep luck in the corner, prefering strategy over all, this is why the game's combat system is based on bonuses and not on dices


2 different decks of playing cards for each side - this gives the player more strategical opportunities to use the cards and play the game in different ways
These T-shirts come only in BLACK.  They have a white RIOT Logo on the front.  They come is sizes Small, Medium, Large 
and X-Large.  If you would like a larger size. 2XL will be an added 
 € 2.00, and 3XL will be an added  € 4.00 to your order.As this will be a 4 players game we need YOU to decide wich will the other two sides involved in the RIOT be.  At the end of the campaign we'll held an ONLINE SURVEY to get answers from all the backers. RIOT is scheduled for production around the end of June 2014. 
This means that delivery  is expected within September of 2014. The production of the game will be done in an italian manufacturer ensuring the quality of the components, and will be shipped from there.You can add the shipping cost to the perk contribution, or by making a different free contribution.If you are going to choose more perks, you can add the TOTAL postage to one of the contributions.For example, if you live in Germany and you selected a ""Player"" perk, the contribution field will display  € 23. To add  € 9 for postage, you'll have to manually type in € 32.The copies of the game will be shipped from Italy.Payments are processed through Paypal which ensures the security of your
 transaction and refund in case our funding goal isn't reached. If you don't have a Paypal account you can create one using any Credit Card.Email contact: info@riotboardgame.comPS: REMEMBER TO SHARE, THANK YOUVERSIONE ITALIANARIOT è un gioco da tavola che parla di conflitto sociale. Le due parti coinvolte sono la Polizia e i Manifestanti; vogliamo creare una simulazione il più realistica possibile di una situazione di tensione politica e sommossa urbana.Su RIOT ogni giocatore deve scegliere da che parte stare ed ottenere il controllo delle strade della città, occupando i vari quartieri.Questa raccolta fondi conclude un periodo durato 12 mesi e fatto di immaginazione, ricerca, test (ancora in corso) su 4 diversi tipi di prototipo, per arrivare alla realizzazione di un gioco  da tavola piacevole e facile da imparare, che possa parlare della realtà,  in un momento di crisi e conflitti sociali crescenti.Il vostro supporto ci aiuterà a far diventare realtà questa idea ed in cambio sarete i primi ad avere tra le mani una copia del gioco.Il nostro obiettivo è quello di produrre in Italia le prime copie del gioco (bilingue ITA-ENG) al prezzo più basso possibile, in modo tale che tutti possano permetterselo. Vogliamo anche migliorare la parte grafica (aggiungere i colori, ridisegnare la mappa...) grazie all'aiuto di un illustratore, e continuare a testare il gioco per renderlo sempre più avvincente.Allo stesso tempo vogliamo creare un gioco che sia giocabile anche da 4 giocatori (Vedi la sezione Sondaggio per i dettagli) Per fare questo abbiamo bisogno di € 3.500 che spenderemo così:All'interno della scatola del gioco troverete:
1 plancia
1 manuale delle regole ( ITA - ENG)
148 carte da gioco divise in 9 mazzi differenti ( ITA - ENG )
135 segnalini circolari in cartone
4 tavole riepilogative in cartone (una per giocatore)
2 miniature in plastica
2 segnapunti in plastica
RIOT usa diverse meccaniche tipiche dei giochi da tavola che consentono di sviluppare varie strategie e modalità di gioco differenti.
Gestione delle risorse - le risorse vengono ottenute e utilizzate dai giocatori in maniera costante e in molti modi diversi, dando la possibilità ad ognuno di diversificare la propria strategia
Tipi di unità differenti - ogni giocatore può schierare 4 differenti tipi di unità + 2 personaggi speciali, ognuno con differenti caratteristiche e abilità
2 mazzi di carte diversi per ogni giocatore  - questo dà la possibilità ai giocatori di utilizzare diverse strategie di gioco in base alle carte che si decide di usare e a come vengono utilizzate
Le T-shirts sono solo di colore NERO. Hanno il logo di RIOT davanti e l'indirizzo del sito sul retro. Le taglie sono: Small, Medium, Large e X-Large. Se avete bisogno di una taglia più grande:  per l' XXL aggiungete € 3.00, per la XXXL aggiungete € 4.00 al vostro ordine.Il gioco definitivo sarà adatto anche a 4 giocatori; per questo abbiamo bisogno di VOI per decidere quali saranno le  altre due fazioni coinvolte in RIOT. Alla fine della raccolta fondi organizzeremo un SONDAGGIO ONLINE per avere una risposta da tutti i donatori.Se riusciremo a raggiungere il traguardo la produzione di RIOT inizierà intorno alla fine di Giugno 2014. Questo significa che lo potrete ricevere a casa da Settembre 2014. La produzione del gioco verrà fatta in Italia da un'azienda del settore, garantendo la massima qualità di tutti i componenti.Puoi aggiungere le spese di spedizione al costo del premio facendo un'unica donazione, oppure in un secondo momento effettuando una donazione libera.Se vuoi ricevere più di un premio, puoi anche aggiungere il TOTALE ad una delle singole donazioni effettuate.Per esempio, se vivi in Italia e ha selezionato un premio ""Giocatore"", il campo donazione ti mostrerà € 23. Per aggiungere € 7 per le spedizioni, dovrai digitare manualmente € 30.Le spedizioni saranno effettuate dall'ItaliaI pagamenti devono essere effettuati attraverso Paypal che garantisce la massima sicurezza ad entrambe le parti e la restituzione immediata dei soldi nel caso in cui il progetto non fosse completamente finanziato.Se non avete un account Paypal potete crearne uno in pochissimi minuti collegandoci la vostra Carta di Credito (va bene anche la POSTEPAY)Contatto Email: info@riotboardgame.com

<h2>Dear Stampout contributors and fans</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>On March 17th, 2013 our crowdfunding for Stampout has finished. To honestly come directly to the point: We have completely missed our financial goals! </strong></p>
<p>So, what's next? The most important thing is that we will not give up and we will continue our work on Stampout.</p>
<p>But one step after the other:</p>
<p><strong>First of all we want to thank you all again. Thanks for the ones who have supported us in a financial manner. Thanks for all who have given us feedback to Stampout and to our crowdfunding campaign. And finally thanks to all that have helped us spreading the word about Stampout or who have helped us in any other way.</strong></p>
<h3>So, what are the facts?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have missed all of our goals (goal 1 to goal 5).</li>
<li>We have only received about 927 USD.</li>
<li>Our campaign reached theoretically about 150'000 people (due to analysis and the addressed network range).</li>
<li>Most important: For a planned minimum continuation of Stampout a goal of 20'000 USD had to be reached -this goal we have also missed.</li>
<li>Our crowdfunding campaign is a big disaster on the financial side, but it is a good chance to learn a lot from it for the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are our first findings?</h3>
<ul>
<li>From people who were able to play Stampout (contributors of the beta test perk and invited people) we received a lot of constructive feedback and not to forget often a statement like: <strong>”<em>… It’s a great puzzle game where you have to recognize structures and you have to be really fast and I’m sure will bring you fun for a long time. Just great ...</em>”</strong> (<em><strong>Marc Lynn, from the band Gotthard</strong></em>).</li>
<li>People who were not able to play Stampout and have only read about Stampout on the website and on the crowdfunding campaign page were unfortunately not convinced.</li>
<li>Although we have received a lot of feedback, unfortunately only a few were really willing to support us financially.</li>
<li>The details, the technical feedback we have received and the result from the beta test will soon be posted to you.</li>
<li><strong>So our conclusion is that we have made our job in the crowdfunding campaign not as good as required, but we are more convinced than ever that Stampout has a potential for a successful launch (but only if we learn how to promote our game better and to convince the community of Stampout's potential).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next week we will start our third Stampout workshop. Main topics are the analysis of the crowdfunding campaign, the general feedback, the beta test results and the re-scheduling of the project. Yes, based on the missing of goal 1 in the crowdfunding campaign, we are not able to reach our planned minimum feature set to release Stampout in June 2013. So we will need to re-plan our project work, also to include all the feedback that is relevant and approved by our development team and most important: We have to find other investment sources. We will inform you about our findings in detail after the third Stampout workshop in April 2013.</p>
<p>At this moment we hope that it will take about three months for securing our needed investments. Therefore a possible release of Stampout has to be shifted to the third quarter of 2013, also depending on the approved feature set resulting from the beta test feedback analysis. And we have to be honest: There is a worst case scenario: If we don't find an alternative investment source, the completion of Stampout is not assured. But there’s one promise we give you: We will try hard to find a solution to release our game. So please keep in touch with us so that you don't miss important news about Stampout!</p>
<h3>For all contributors of our recent crowdfunding campaign we have the following important additional news: </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Stampout.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
Although our campaign has missed the goals, we will deliver your perks as promised in June 2013.</li>
<li>Due to the fact that Stampout will not be released in June 2013, we have to adjust some perks, because Stampout will not be completed by then.</li>
<li>We will inform all contributors in details about the individual changes after the third Stampout workshop in April 2013.</li>
<li>As a compensation for the adjusted perks we will offer all contributors the current version of Stampout for free for ever. Please keep in mind; this is a beta version and not a complete game. Contributors of the beta perk will also be able to upgrade to the current version (the beta version was planned to be limited to the beta test timeframe). And the best thing is that all current contributors will get any further version of Stampout that will be produced for free for ever as well. This includes also a potential re-launch of Stampout or a future release in Apple's iTunes Store, independently if that possible release will be free of costs or not. Information how you will get the free Stampout version will be sent to you by email in April 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that you understand our situation and you appreciate our offer.</p>
<p>We are now heading forward to our third Stampout workshop. We will keep you informed and we hope that you still believe in us and in Stampout. And please continue to spread the word about our game – Thank you!</p>

<h2>NEWS</h2>
<h3>February 23rd, 2013</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi Followers</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To clarify a possible misunderstanding: The mimimum goal we have to achive to finialze and release a first version of Stampout is that we reach goal 1. This means that as soon as we get in minimum $ 20'000 then a Stampout release in Apple's iTunes Store is assured (accourding the goal 1 specification; see below).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Higher contributions (goals 2 - 5) enable us to bring you additional features or support for other platforms.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I hope this helps for clarification.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Best regards,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Patrick<br/></strong>Producer of Stampout</p>
<h3>February 17th, 2013</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dear all</p>
Thank you all for your feedback to our survey, to our crowdfunding campaign and to Stampout itself. We have heard your feedback, we learn from it (it's our first campaign;-)) and we want to improve our campaign and give you the information you asked for!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a first step we addressed the major issues:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Explanation of what will we do with the money.</li>
<li>A new game-play introduction video will soon be published that explains how Stampout is played</li>
<li>Added a new pre-purchase perk for the ones that only want to buy Stampout before the official launch for a lower price (and don't want explicitly to support the development itself)</li>
<li>Upgraded all perks with an included version for the iOS device right after the release (only applies to perks that have not already a free copy included).</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stay tuned. We will keep you informed and we appreciate any further feedback.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Patrick<br/></strong>Producer of Stampout</p>
<h3>February 12th, 2013</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi all</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recently we have started this crowdfunding campaign for Stampout. We have to be honest … so far we are not satisfied with our progress. So, something seems to be wrong. Therefore we want to start analyzing what’s wrong and what can we made better so that you will like Stampout as much as we do. Therefore we kindly ask you to support us by giving us some feedback to our campaign – it only takes some seconds. The poll can be found on our game website: <a href=""http://www.stampout.ch/?p=731"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stampout.ch/?p=731</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thank you very much!</p>

<h2>FACTS AND GOALS IN SUMMARY</h2>
<h3>Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stampout is planned to be released in June 2013, based on the goal 1 feature set and that we reach this goal with your contribution.</li>

<h2>THE STORY BEHIND</h2>
<h3>About a dream</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.traentworks.com/index.php/aboutteam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Patrick Diezi, Game Producer of Stampout"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.traentworks.com/images/sitemedia/portrait_corrected_linkedin_256x256.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 4px 14px;"" title=""This is me, Patrick""/></a>I'm Patrick, I'm from Switzerland and this is my story:</p>
<p>Since many years I love to play computer and video games. I grew up with the Commodore C64 and had the luck to enjoy many of the inspiring and famous games of the last three decades.</p>
<p>I've always been passionated about creating my own ideas, so I already early started to develop my small projects. But my biggest dream always was to have my own company and to create games for a bigger audiance.</p>
<p>In December 2011 I started to make my dream come true. I formed my company TRAENTWORKS (<a href=""http://www.traentworks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.traentworks.com</a>), where we focus on the development of gaming, learning and training products. Our goal is to make learning and training more enjoyable and therefore we are combining gaming elements with professional learning and training solutions.</p>
<h3>The starting idea</h3>
<p>Already some years ago I had the idea of the game mechanics Stampout is based on. One of the first sketches about the game is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt=""First sktech about the game idea of Stampout"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Flip.it_1.png"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 14px; float: left;"" title=""First Stampout sketch""/></p>
<p>At the beginning the game was called ""Flip.it"". Later the name was changed to ""Stampout"".</p>
<p>With the formation of my company the real work on Stampout started. During the followed months I wrote the game design concept and developed some first prototypes. We also decided to invest our money into the development until we reach our beta version. This beta version now should and is the starting point for our crowdfunding campaign that helps us to fulfill our goal: The release of version 1.0 of Stampout!</p>
<h3>It get's real</h3>
<p>In summer 2012, I finally crowded some friends to start the development of Stampout. The first milestone was our kick-off workshop where we took some first decisions about gameplay improvement and art design. Below are some impressions from that workshop:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.stampout.ch/?p=551"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Flipchart brainstorming about the game high concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/plugins/dopwgg/uploads/N6Pk7rLDpNFT6Ex1Wsgj6DHXGYd5KhTzSb4mWhmx7YqAqpKBS22rAzafCyyfLBm9z.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 14px;"" title=""Game high concept brainstorming""/></a><a href=""http://www.stampout.ch/?p=551"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Flipchart brainstorming about the game features"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/plugins/dopwgg/uploads/szK7gxOa8ewmAgOCXyXSpyTTFXeErQLZWmABqXO4Lhd149mDe48ALK9fCT95d7jCK.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 14px;"" title=""Game features brainstorming""/></a></p>
<p>On our Stampout website you will find additional information and photos from that first workshop (<a href=""http://www.stampout.ch/?p=551"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stampout.ch/?p=551</a>).</p>
<p>Between the first gameplay ideas and the beta version that is available now we have gone through many iterations. Not only the game title has changed also some elementary parts of the gameplay have been optimized, so that the game gets a more unique touch about speed and pattern recognition.</p>
<h3>And now?</h3>
<p><strong>We are now ready to launch the first beta version and to start the crowdfunding campaign!</strong></p>
<p>By the way, if you want to know more about the development history of Stampout, then please visit our game website (<a href=""http://www.stampout.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stampout.ch</a>). You'll find many background infos there, the latest news about the development, photos and artworks from the last months as well as our development blog.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS STAMPOUT?</h2>
<p>Stampout is a puzzle game with the key elements of speed and pattern recognition.</p>
<h3>Some words about the gameplay</h3>
<p>The player plays against the time and the scores and achievements of other players.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.stampout.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Stampout beta gameplay screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Stampout.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 10px; float: right;"" title=""Stampout beta gameplay""/></a></p>
<p>At the beginning of a game the computer is randomly placing stamps (a predefined quad area with different quad levels represented by colors) on the initially clean play-field. All the quads where the stamp was placed are incremented by the quad levels of the stamp. Overlapping stamps will influence each other. Everywhere where the maximum quad level is reached, the quad level is reseted and the incremention continues.</p>
<p>The goal for the player is now to clean the play-field by placing the same stamp at the correct positions with the difference, that the player decrements the quad levels.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as soon as the player puts the first stamp onto the play-field, the remaining game time starts counting down. The player has to try to place the stamps as fast as possible. He is able to get time back if many correct placed stamps are combined in short time, leading him to combos, that will not only bring more scores as other stamps, but also additional time.</p>
<p>As soon as a level is completely cleaned the game continues with a new level of higher complexity.</p>
<p>The game is over as soon as there's no remaining time left.</p>
<h3>Again, how is Stampout played?</h3>
<p>To visualize the gameplay, nothing is better than a gameplay video:</p>

<h2>OUR CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN</h2>
<h3>Why we need you</h3>
<p>In the last months we have invested our money to get this beta version of Stampout running. For the last project phase until the release of Stampout in June 2013 we still have some great ideas we want to integrate into our game.</p>
<p>We do not only appreciate your financial sponsorship for the remaining work but we also like you to participate in the final steps to the launch by giving us feedback and beta testing support.</p>
<p><strong>In the next two months there will be a closed beta testing going on, starting today with the launch of this campaign. Because our beta keys are limited, you are able to get one of them by supporting us with the ""Closed Beta"" perk.</strong></p>
<p>The following work is still to be done for release 1.0 (among other things):</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Adding achievement badges for won scores, reached levels and realized combos.</li>
<li>Implementation of ranking system to compare your results.</li>
<li>Integration of Facebook, so you can compete with your facebook friends.</li>
<li>Adding of graphical and acoustic sound effects.</li>
<li>Improvements of the menus.</li>
<li>Extending the tutorial.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning of the graphics.</li>
<li>Adding additional music for menus and other sound effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>To complete our feature list until release 1.0 we need about 75'000 USD. In summary the money raised will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying our work and our freelancers work for the mentioned features.</li>
<li>Licensing costs for music and sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have still some other ideas. Some of them could already be included in version 1.0 or are maybe foreseen for later updates. The implementation and integration of these ideas depend also on the crowdfunding response. Here are some examples of ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing of replays.</li>
<li>Upload of replays to YouTube into a special ""speed running channel"" so that you can show to the world your amazing game-plays.</li>
<li>Facebook updates you on your mobile devices about new records of your Facebook friends.</li>
<li>Additional game-play modes (e.g. with changing stamps or playing a ghost (playing against a collegues' replay)).</li>
<li>Integration of a theme framework, so that additional themes will be supported (see below for a possible next theme... an early concept).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""http://www.stampout.ch/?p=564"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""An early ice theme art design concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/plugins/dopwgg/uploads/OtxLSDpk7zxQbxekHdNjaNz8GKKXwM3Pa7zsRbMGNrqR78hrFhwjeTkaSwzwFfhC1.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 14px;"" title=""Ice theme game-field""/></a><a href=""http://www.stampout.ch/?p=564"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><img alt=""The ice theme cube art design concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/plugins/dopwgg/uploads/5gYWEmWBhjXQzKNdz1r98WdjMh1jOp2DOy1Y6f7b2Tce4rMrK2REPHwq5DbkBDC8f.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 14px;"" title=""Ice theme cubes""/><img alt=""The ice theme menu art design concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.stampout.ch/wp-content/plugins/dopwgg/uploads/G25Oq7OaZ24EHE6q6g33thazFTrMs1fQBsEg9yZsAwefGB5bPcwyQj1jzYn3gW8PH.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px 14px;"" title=""Ice theme menu""/></strong></a></p>
<p><strong>In addition to your financial help we also want your feedback! Any constructive feedback is important for us and helps us to improve in any way. This is an important requirement so that Stampout becomes as good as possible. </strong></p>
<p><strong>For a detailed feature schedule based on the overall contribution please have a look at the facts and goals section above (after the news section at the beginning of this page).<br/></strong></p>
<p>There are two main ways for you to help us getting the game ready for a perfect launch and mainly also for your personal amazing play experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join our closed beta testing by getting a ""Closed Beta"" perk. You will get the chance to be one of a few people in the world that will be able to play Stampout some months before the official launch!</li>
<li>Give us your feedback. Tell us everything you think about what you see, read and hear about our game. Share your ideas with us. But please, be constructive :-).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can contact us through this campaign website or through our website. There you will also find a forum to share your comments and ideas.</p>
<h3>What will you get?</h3>
<p><strong>First of all, you will be part of our story and our dream!</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore you will get some additional goodies that will not be available for all other ""normal"" buyers that will buy Stampout directly from Apple's iTunes Store.</p>
<p>Among other perks, there are some highlights we want to mention here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>""Closed Beta"" perk:</strong> You will get exclusive access to the closed beta. In addition you will get Stampout for free after launch and you will be named in the credits as beta tester.</li>
<li>
<strong>""Collector Editior"" perk:</strong> This perk includes a printed art book, a printed game high concept document from the development start of the game, a signed postcard of the developer team, a Stampout shirt and a free version of the released game. Everything will be delivered in an elegant collector edition box.</li>
<li>
<strong>""Exclusive Art"" perk:</strong> This is a very unique and exclusive perk limited to only three items. It's a big, high quality and exclusive art perk made by a Swiss graphic artists. Every of these items will be unique in the world and will be an artistic interpretation of Stampout and TRAENTWORKS.</li>
<li>
<strong>""Workshop III Attendance"" perk:</strong> With this perk you get an exclusive invitation to be part for one day at our third and last workshop about Stampout. This workshop will take place in Switzerland near Zürich around the beginning of April 2013. The main topic is the analysis of the closed beta outcome and the final planning of the remaing features for release 1.0. This perk will give you the chance to play an active part of the decisions taken for the last development phase of Stampout. Your feedback and collaboration in the workshop will be as important for us as the one's of all other members. To fulfill your job you will also get the ""Stampout Closed Beta Perk"". Included are also two accommodations in the same hotel where our team will stay during the workshop. Not to forget: Eating and drinking will also be included during the workshop day and you will join the team for the evening dinner. This perk is unfortunately limitied to only a few people.</li>
<li>
<strong>""Stampout Release Party Attendance Perk"":</strong> This perk will give you the chance to be part of our release party in June 2013. Included will be also one accomodation in the same hotel where our team will stay and all food and drinks during the party.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only five interesting perks. So have a look at the other possibilities to get a complete overview of what we will give you back for your support and help!</p>
</div>
<h3>What if we don't reach our financial goal?</h3>
<p>The obvious way will be that we need to prioritize the features we had planned for release 1.0. Maybe we will be able to get a chance to deliver the remaining features later. When we are speaking about prioritization we will prefer quality over feature quantity. This means we have to cut away some planned features.</p>
<p>But to be honest, it's never a good idea to cut down a dream. So we won't give up and try to find possibilities to realize version 1.0 of Stampout in the way and quality we think it should be released.</p>
<p>And what if the campaign will really go bad? Then we will have to analyze in deep our game idea, the concept and also the campaign ... what was wrong? The game idea? The presentation? The campaign? The communication? After that analysis we will restart our project and create a new campaign with the experience we got so far, also with your feedback, so that Stampout will become the game the audiance and we want.</p>
<p>In any of these cases we will use the money that was raised for the prioritized features or if necessary for a deep analysis why we missed our goal completely. Afterwards we will discuss a restart of Stampout and a new campaign and we will share our experiences so that others might learn as well.</p>
<div>
<h3>What impact can this campaign have?</h3>
<p>If we are successful, the finalization of Stampout is assured in the way we planned it and you will get an enjoyable puzzle game with hopefully many hours of fun and challenging game-play.</p>
<p>If not we will make some smaller or bigger adjustments so that the game can be released with a slightly changed feature set or later in a way, that makes us all satisfied anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever will be, we will try and work hard to have Stampout released!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Other ways how you can help us<br/></strong></h3>
</div>
<div>Independent from your decision to help us in this campaign or not, please spread your word about our game, follow us on twitter #TE_Stampout (<a href=""https://twitter.com/TE_Stampout"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">twitter.com/TE_Stampout</a>), like us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/testampout"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/testampout</a>) and talk with your friends and colleagues about Stampout.</div>
<h2>WHATEVER YOUR DECISION WILL BE, WE HONESTLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST AND SUPPORT. EVERY HELP IS APPRECIATED AS WE NEED YOU TO FULFILL OUR DREAM! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</h2></div>","Dear Stampout contributors and fans
 
On March 17th, 2013 our crowdfunding for Stampout has finished. To honestly come directly to the point: We have completely missed our financial goals! 
So, what's next? The most important thing is that we will not give up and we will continue our work on Stampout.
But one step after the other:
First of all we want to thank you all again. Thanks for the ones who have supported us in a financial manner. Thanks for all who have given us feedback to Stampout and to our crowdfunding campaign. And finally thanks to all that have helped us spreading the word about Stampout or who have helped us in any other way.
So, what are the facts?

We have missed all of our goals (goal 1 to goal 5).
We have only received about 927 USD.
Our campaign reached theoretically about 150'000 people (due to analysis and the addressed network range).
Most important: For a planned minimum continuation of Stampout a goal of 20'000 USD had to be reached -this goal we have also missed.
Our crowdfunding campaign is a big disaster on the financial side, but it is a good chance to learn a lot from it for the future.

What are our first findings?

From people who were able to play Stampout (contributors of the beta test perk and invited people) we received a lot of constructive feedback and not to forget often a statement like: ”… It’s a great puzzle game where you have to recognize structures and you have to be really fast and I’m sure will bring you fun for a long time. Just great ...” (Marc Lynn, from the band Gotthard).
People who were not able to play Stampout and have only read about Stampout on the website and on the crowdfunding campaign page were unfortunately not convinced.
Although we have received a lot of feedback, unfortunately only a few were really willing to support us financially.
The details, the technical feedback we have received and the result from the beta test will soon be posted to you.
So our conclusion is that we have made our job in the crowdfunding campaign not as good as required, but we are more convinced than ever that Stampout has a potential for a successful launch (but only if we learn how to promote our game better and to convince the community of Stampout's potential).

Next week we will start our third Stampout workshop. Main topics are the analysis of the crowdfunding campaign, the general feedback, the beta test results and the re-scheduling of the project. Yes, based on the missing of goal 1 in the crowdfunding campaign, we are not able to reach our planned minimum feature set to release Stampout in June 2013. So we will need to re-plan our project work, also to include all the feedback that is relevant and approved by our development team and most important: We have to find other investment sources. We will inform you about our findings in detail after the third Stampout workshop in April 2013.
At this moment we hope that it will take about three months for securing our needed investments. Therefore a possible release of Stampout has to be shifted to the third quarter of 2013, also depending on the approved feature set resulting from the beta test feedback analysis. And we have to be honest: There is a worst case scenario: If we don't find an alternative investment source, the completion of Stampout is not assured. But there’s one promise we give you: We will try hard to find a solution to release our game. So please keep in touch with us so that you don't miss important news about Stampout!
For all contributors of our recent crowdfunding campaign we have the following important additional news: 



Although our campaign has missed the goals, we will deliver your perks as promised in June 2013.
Due to the fact that Stampout will not be released in June 2013, we have to adjust some perks, because Stampout will not be completed by then.
We will inform all contributors in details about the individual changes after the third Stampout workshop in April 2013.
As a compensation for the adjusted perks we will offer all contributors the current version of Stampout for free for ever. Please keep in mind; this is a beta version and not a complete game. Contributors of the beta perk will also be able to upgrade to the current version (the beta version was planned to be limited to the beta test timeframe). And the best thing is that all current contributors will get any further version of Stampout that will be produced for free for ever as well. This includes also a potential re-launch of Stampout or a future release in Apple's iTunes Store, independently if that possible release will be free of costs or not. Information how you will get the free Stampout version will be sent to you by email in April 2013.

We hope that you understand our situation and you appreciate our offer.
We are now heading forward to our third Stampout workshop. We will keep you informed and we hope that you still believe in us and in Stampout. And please continue to spread the word about our game – Thank you!
 If you have any concrete questions or want to tell us something, you can visit our forum (http://www.stampout.ch/?page_id=719) or contact us directly: stampout@traentworks.com.
Thank you again for your support and let's keep in touch!
 
Kind regards,
Patrick.Producer of Stampout

Hi Followers
To clarify a possible misunderstanding: The mimimum goal we have to achive to finialze and release a first version of Stampout is that we reach goal 1. This means that as soon as we get in minimum $ 20'000 then a Stampout release in Apple's iTunes Store is assured (accourding the goal 1 specification; see below).
Higher contributions (goals 2 - 5) enable us to bring you additional features or support for other platforms.
I hope this helps for clarification.
Best regards,

Dear all
Thank you all for your feedback to our survey, to our crowdfunding campaign and to Stampout itself. We have heard your feedback, we learn from it (it's our first campaign;-)) and we want to improve our campaign and give you the information you asked for!
 
As a first step we addressed the major issues:


Explanation of what will we do with the money.
A new game-play introduction video will soon be published that explains how Stampout is played
Added a new pre-purchase perk for the ones that only want to buy Stampout before the official launch for a lower price (and don't want explicitly to support the development itself)
Upgraded all perks with an included version for the iOS device right after the release (only applies to perks that have not already a free copy included).

Stay tuned. We will keep you informed and we appreciate any further feedback.

Hi all
Recently we have started this crowdfunding campaign for Stampout. We have to be honest … so far we are not satisfied with our progress. So, something seems to be wrong. Therefore we want to start analyzing what’s wrong and what can we made better so that you will like Stampout as much as we do. Therefore we kindly ask you to support us by giving us some feedback to our campaign – it only takes some seconds. The poll can be found on our game website: www.stampout.ch/?p=731.
Thank you very much!

FACTS AND GOALS IN SUMMARY
Facts

Creation of a second theme (new graphics, music and sound) for the launch of release 1.0.
The player will also get the possibility to play its own music.

Your money is needed to:

Implement the features and to complete the work mentioned above and of goal 1 to 3.
Paying our work and our freelancers work for Stampout's goal 1 to 4.
Licensing costs for music and sounds.


If you really help us by your contribution so that we reach goal 5 then we will definitively launch Stampout also for the Android, PC and MAC platform!
Please take note of:


The additional work for added platforms will require a step by step release schedule for Stampout:

Launch of iOS release: June 2013.
Launch of Windows and Mac release: October 2013.
Launch of Android release: December 2013.


If we reach this goal 5, then every contributor of this campaign will get an additional free version for Android, Windows and Mac (short after the corrsponding platform release is launched).

Your money is needed to:

Implement the features of goals 1 to 4 and to migrate Stampout to the Android, Windows and Mac platform.
Paying our work and our freelancers work for Stampout's goal 1 to 4.
Licensing costs for required development licenses for the added platforms.
Purchasing of test equipment for the additional platforms (mainly for Android devices).


What if we reach a lot more than $ 75'000? We have still some other ideas. The implementation and integration of these ideas depend also on the crowdfunding response.
Here are some examples of ideas:

Additional game-play modes (e.g. with changing stamps or playing a ghost (playing against a collegues' replay)).
Support for Windows Phone.
Development of Stampout as Windows 8 App.

ALL ABOUT STAMPOUT

THE STORY BEHIND
About a dream
I'm Patrick, I'm from Switzerland and this is my story:
Since many years I love to play computer and video games. I grew up with the Commodore C64 and had the luck to enjoy many of the inspiring and famous games of the last three decades.
I've always been passionated about creating my own ideas, so I already early started to develop my small projects. But my biggest dream always was to have my own company and to create games for a bigger audiance.
In December 2011 I started to make my dream come true. I formed my company TRAENTWORKS (www.traentworks.com), where we focus on the development of gaming, learning and training products. Our goal is to make learning and training more enjoyable and therefore we are combining gaming elements with professional learning and training solutions.
The starting idea
Already some years ago I had the idea of the game mechanics Stampout is based on. One of the first sketches about the game is shown below:

At the beginning the game was called ""Flip.it"". Later the name was changed to ""Stampout"".
With the formation of my company the real work on Stampout started. During the followed months I wrote the game design concept and developed some first prototypes. We also decided to invest our money into the development until we reach our beta version. This beta version now should and is the starting point for our crowdfunding campaign that helps us to fulfill our goal: The release of version 1.0 of Stampout!
It get's real
In summer 2012, I finally crowded some friends to start the development of Stampout. The first milestone was our kick-off workshop where we took some first decisions about gameplay improvement and art design. Below are some impressions from that workshop:

On our Stampout website you will find additional information and photos from that first workshop (www.stampout.ch/?p=551).
Between the first gameplay ideas and the beta version that is available now we have gone through many iterations. Not only the game title has changed also some elementary parts of the gameplay have been optimized, so that the game gets a more unique touch about speed and pattern recognition.
And now?
We are now ready to launch the first beta version and to start the crowdfunding campaign!
By the way, if you want to know more about the development history of Stampout, then please visit our game website (www.stampout.ch). You'll find many background infos there, the latest news about the development, photos and artworks from the last months as well as our development blog.
WHAT IS STAMPOUT?
Stampout is a puzzle game with the key elements of speed and pattern recognition.
Some words about the gameplay
The player plays against the time and the scores and achievements of other players.

At the beginning of a game the computer is randomly placing stamps (a predefined quad area with different quad levels represented by colors) on the initially clean play-field. All the quads where the stamp was placed are incremented by the quad levels of the stamp. Overlapping stamps will influence each other. Everywhere where the maximum quad level is reached, the quad level is reseted and the incremention continues.
The goal for the player is now to clean the play-field by placing the same stamp at the correct positions with the difference, that the player decrements the quad levels.
Unfortunately, as soon as the player puts the first stamp onto the play-field, the remaining game time starts counting down. The player has to try to place the stamps as fast as possible. He is able to get time back if many correct placed stamps are combined in short time, leading him to combos, that will not only bring more scores as other stamps, but also additional time.
As soon as a level is completely cleaned the game continues with a new level of higher complexity.
The game is over as soon as there's no remaining time left.
Again, how is Stampout played?
To visualize the gameplay, nothing is better than a gameplay video:
About Stampout's features
Core features of Stampout:

Speed-driven and pattern recognition based puzzle game
Losing and winning time
Achievments for scores, levels and combos
Competition through ranking statistics with your Facebook colleagues

Supported platforms
As initial launch platform we chose Apple's iOS. The following devices (with minimum iOS 4.0) will be supported:

iPhone 3GS and newer
iPad 1 and newer

Currently we are also testing the iPod touch devices. A final decision about a planned release for that devices will be taken within the next weeks.
Other platforms like Android, Windows Phone, PC and Mac are planned for the future but also depend on the crowdfunding response of this campaign.
And when will Stampout be released?
We are looking forward to a Stampout release in Apple's iTunes Store in June 2013!
OUR TEAM
Since summer 2012 our team has grown. Currently six project members from three countries in Europe are working on Stampout:


Ursula Waldner, TRAENTWORKS (www.traentworks.com): She is the associate producer of Stampout.

Robin Ebser, Robin Ebser Visual Engineering (www.visng.com): He is our development lead and coding guru.

and not to forget ... myself:
Patrick Diezi, TRAENTWORKS (www.traentworks.com): I'm the game producer and designer of Stampout and the CEO of TRAENTWORKS.
Below there are photos of some Stampout team members, taken at the last two workshops:


OUR CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN
Why we need you
In the last months we have invested our money to get this beta version of Stampout running. For the last project phase until the release of Stampout in June 2013 we still have some great ideas we want to integrate into our game.
We do not only appreciate your financial sponsorship for the remaining work but we also like you to participate in the final steps to the launch by giving us feedback and beta testing support.
In the next two months there will be a closed beta testing going on, starting today with the launch of this campaign. Because our beta keys are limited, you are able to get one of them by supporting us with the ""Closed Beta"" perk.
The following work is still to be done for release 1.0 (among other things):


Adding achievement badges for won scores, reached levels and realized combos.
Implementation of ranking system to compare your results.
Integration of Facebook, so you can compete with your facebook friends.
Adding of graphical and acoustic sound effects.
Improvements of the menus.
Extending the tutorial.
Fine-tuning of the graphics.
Adding additional music for menus and other sound effects.

To complete our feature list until release 1.0 we need about 75'000 USD. In summary the money raised will be used for:

Paying our work and our freelancers work for the mentioned features.
Licensing costs for music and sounds.

We also have still some other ideas. Some of them could already be included in version 1.0 or are maybe foreseen for later updates. The implementation and integration of these ideas depend also on the crowdfunding response. Here are some examples of ideas:

Sharing of replays.
Upload of replays to YouTube into a special ""speed running channel"" so that you can show to the world your amazing game-plays.
Facebook updates you on your mobile devices about new records of your Facebook friends.
Additional game-play modes (e.g. with changing stamps or playing a ghost (playing against a collegues' replay)).
Integration of a theme framework, so that additional themes will be supported (see below for a possible next theme... an early concept).


In addition to your financial help we also want your feedback! Any constructive feedback is important for us and helps us to improve in any way. This is an important requirement so that Stampout becomes as good as possible. 
For a detailed feature schedule based on the overall contribution please have a look at the facts and goals section above (after the news section at the beginning of this page).
There are two main ways for you to help us getting the game ready for a perfect launch and mainly also for your personal amazing play experience:

Join our closed beta testing by getting a ""Closed Beta"" perk. You will get the chance to be one of a few people in the world that will be able to play Stampout some months before the official launch!
Give us your feedback. Tell us everything you think about what you see, read and hear about our game. Share your ideas with us. But please, be constructive :-).

You can contact us through this campaign website or through our website. There you will also find a forum to share your comments and ideas.
What will you get?
First of all, you will be part of our story and our dream!
Furthermore you will get some additional goodies that will not be available for all other ""normal"" buyers that will buy Stampout directly from Apple's iTunes Store.
Among other perks, there are some highlights we want to mention here:


""Closed Beta"" perk: You will get exclusive access to the closed beta. In addition you will get Stampout for free after launch and you will be named in the credits as beta tester.

""Collector Editior"" perk: This perk includes a printed art book, a printed game high concept document from the development start of the game, a signed postcard of the developer team, a Stampout shirt and a free version of the released game. Everything will be delivered in an elegant collector edition box.

""Exclusive Art"" perk: This is a very unique and exclusive perk limited to only three items. It's a big, high quality and exclusive art perk made by a Swiss graphic artists. Every of these items will be unique in the world and will be an artistic interpretation of Stampout and TRAENTWORKS.

""Workshop III Attendance"" perk: With this perk you get an exclusive invitation to be part for one day at our third and last workshop about Stampout. This workshop will take place in Switzerland near Zürich around the beginning of April 2013. The main topic is the analysis of the closed beta outcome and the final planning of the remaing features for release 1.0. This perk will give you the chance to play an active part of the decisions taken for the last development phase of Stampout. Your feedback and collaboration in the workshop will be as important for us as the one's of all other members. To fulfill your job you will also get the ""Stampout Closed Beta Perk"". Included are also two accommodations in the same hotel where our team will stay during the workshop. Not to forget: Eating and drinking will also be included during the workshop day and you will join the team for the evening dinner. This perk is unfortunately limitied to only a few people.

""Stampout Release Party Attendance Perk"": This perk will give you the chance to be part of our release party in June 2013. Included will be also one accomodation in the same hotel where our team will stay and all food and drinks during the party.

These are only five interesting perks. So have a look at the other possibilities to get a complete overview of what we will give you back for your support and help!

What if we don't reach our financial goal?
The obvious way will be that we need to prioritize the features we had planned for release 1.0. Maybe we will be able to get a chance to deliver the remaining features later. When we are speaking about prioritization we will prefer quality over feature quantity. This means we have to cut away some planned features.
But to be honest, it's never a good idea to cut down a dream. So we won't give up and try to find possibilities to realize version 1.0 of Stampout in the way and quality we think it should be released.
And what if the campaign will really go bad? Then we will have to analyze in deep our game idea, the concept and also the campaign ... what was wrong? The game idea? The presentation? The campaign? The communication? After that analysis we will restart our project and create a new campaign with the experience we got so far, also with your feedback, so that Stampout will become the game the audiance and we want.
In any of these cases we will use the money that was raised for the prioritized features or if necessary for a deep analysis why we missed our goal completely. Afterwards we will discuss a restart of Stampout and a new campaign and we will share our experiences so that others might learn as well.

What impact can this campaign have?
If we are successful, the finalization of Stampout is assured in the way we planned it and you will get an enjoyable puzzle game with hopefully many hours of fun and challenging game-play.
If not we will make some smaller or bigger adjustments so that the game can be released with a slightly changed feature set or later in a way, that makes us all satisfied anyway.
Whatever will be, we will try and work hard to have Stampout released!

<div class=""full-description"">
<p>Hello! I'm Rahdo, and I film a series of video runthroughs of board and card games. This year, I plan to go all out and make as many videos for my viewers as I can, and I've been lucky enough to be invited to cover the <a href=""http://boardgametravel.com/summer-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cardboard &amp; Sun 2013</a> event, where people like you and me will be playing board games in the Greek island of Paros, in addition to enjoying the sights, sounds and tastes of this Mediterranean paradise!</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1855928930/rahdo-runs-through-the-series-that-puts-you-at-the"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kickstarter campaign</a> that I ran a couple of months ago for my video series helped cover most of the costs of my attending, including getting a new camera and the flight to Paros. However, I soon realised that there is a lot more to film than just gameplay runthroughs at the event. There is a vibrant board game culture in Greece - publishing, collecting, but above all, playing, and I want to cover this in my video series! And if this campaign funds, I'll be able to spend more time in Athens and make even *more* videos. </p>
<p>This can be accomplished if a bunch of like-minded board game geeks join me for the Cardboard &amp; Sun event in Paros, because <a href=""http://boardgametravel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BoardGameTravel.com</a> (the event organizer) has allowed me to set up my own group, giving me a generous discount that I can pass on to you! </p>
<p>So success with this project means I be able to film and broadcast more content about Greek gaming culture.  What will that look like?</p>
 
<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>For examples of the sorts of boardgaming videos I've been doing so far, you can check my youtube page at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/rahdo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">y</a><a href=""http://youtube.com/rahdo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outube.com/rahdo</a>.</p>
<p>So that's what I've done so far, but now I'd be doing something new for me, a bit more like a documentary, covering the growing Greek boardgame culture.  Visiting boardgame cafes like <a href=""http://www.playhouse.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playhouse</a>, <a href=""http://www.playce.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playce</a>, and <a href=""http://www.playtimecafe.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playtime</a> and awesome stores like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Playscape.Games?sk=wall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playscape</a>.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Greek boardgame culture is exploding, and I want to cover it!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/868405/pictures/full/20130613043349-grbgculture600.png"" src="""" style=""""/><em>Greek boardgame culture is exploding, and I want to cover it!</em>
</div>
<div class=""template asset""> 
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p><em>Why is the goal £2765?</em></p>
<p>Originally, I had set up this campaign on Kickstarter, with a goal of getting 10 folks to join us in Paros, for a total of fund target of £3950.  During that brief KS campaign, a number of people got a chance to pledge, and all was well.  However, due to some obscure Kickstarter rules that I wasn't aware of when I started (it's not allowed to offer travel options as rewards, apparently), Kickstarter suspended that campaign.  BUT, BoardGameTravel.com still honoured their commitment to those early pledgers, and so now we only need 7 more to make our goal! </p>
<p><em>Why is this a flexible funding campaign?</em></p>
<p>Because anyone who contributes will want to arrange their flights to Athens as soon as possible, to make sure that they get the best airfare. As for the previous backers, BoardGameTravel.com has told me that they will honour this rate for you until June 30, no matter what happens, so you are free to book your flights!</p>
 
<h2>The Rewards</h2>
<p>So what do you, the backer get, as your backer reward?  Well, let's talk about about the Cardboard &amp; Sand event! :)</p>
</div>
<p>Well, for starters, designer Touko Tahkokallio, the award winning designer of <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eclipse </a>will be the special guest star. Fans of Eclipse won’t want to miss the chance to play one of the top rated games in the world with the game’s creator, and I'm looking forward to interviewing him about his experiences in making games and what we can expect from him in the future!</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""The many games of Touko Tahkokallio!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/644/091/9055e9d383db82d62740d5333d732264_large.jpg?1370327138"" src="""" style=""""/><em>The many games of Touko Tahkokallio!</em>
</div>
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>Boardgame publishers Portal Games and Ignacy Trzewiczek are co-sponsoring the event, and have promised to send many of Portal's Games, and even organizing a <a href=""http://portalgames.pl/en/vacations-with-portal-games-yes-yes-yes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neuroshima Hex tournament</a>!</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, another exciting reason to attend is that Touko has designed a game especially for the event: <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141019/thermopyles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thermopyles</a>, which will be produced in a very limited quantity, for the participants of the event.</p>
<p>By pledging, you get not only the game, but you join me for a fantastic week on the Greek island of Paros, with access to <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/giourkas?sort=rank&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;rankobjecttype=subtype&amp;rankobjectid=1&amp;columns=title%7Cthumbnail%7Crank%7Cbggrating%7Csubdomains&amp;geekranks=Board+Game+Rank&amp;own=1&amp;ff=1&amp;subtype=boardgame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an incredible library of some of the best boardgames ever</a>, along with a bunch of like-minded board game geeks to play with. All the fun of a convention, but in an intimate Mediterranean paradise.</p>
<p>Please read the <a href=""http://boardgametravel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BoardGameTravel.com</a> website for all terms and conditions, and feel free to ask them if you have any questions.</p>

<h2> The Game</h2>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""THIS... IS... SPARTA!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/625/841/b4a3504338f8336c47808c56506ac7e7_large.png?1369758332"" src="""" style=""""/><em>THIS... IS... SPARTA!</em>
</div>
<p>Thermopyles is a co-op card game that can be quite tough to beat, where players take on the role of the brave 300 Spartans who stood against the invading Persian army at the Thermopyles pass. But rather than tell you about the game you'll be getting by backing this project, I figured I'd show it to you - soon I will have a PnP copy in hand and will make a Rahdo Runthrough of it!</p>
<p>It's a nice little game - a great light filler to play between other games, or even play solo instead of Klondike - so if you'd like to see this game made and in your hands, you might want to consider a trip to the Greek isles!</p>
 
<h2>The Venue</h2>
<p>Now this is something special.  Where else can you spend the morning touring ancient ruins, the afternoon swimming in azure blue seas, and the evening playing Eclipse, with the designer of the game?  This is truly one-of-a-kind experience, and I for one am super excited about it!</p>

<h2>Backer Levels</h2>
<p>For participants there’s only one, which is the all inclusive package travel deal plus free game.  However, if you want to book more than one ticket when backing (this trip makes a perfect romantic getaway for geek couples, or bring friend or the whole family!) you can add the same amount for every additional person you'd like to bring with you to Paros. Simple as that! Each person coming will get their own copy of Thermopyles!</p>
<p>For game publishers and distributors who would like to become a sponsor of the Cardboard &amp; Sun (as has Portal already), there's a backer level that guarantees you coverage for your titles at the event. Contact info@boardgametravel.com for more info on this backer level. :)</p>

</div></div>","Hello! I'm Rahdo, and I film a series of video runthroughs of board and card games. This year, I plan to go all out and make as many videos for my viewers as I can, and I've been lucky enough to be invited to cover the Cardboard & Sun 2013 event, where people like you and me will be playing board games in the Greek island of Paros, in addition to enjoying the sights, sounds and tastes of this Mediterranean paradise!
The Kickstarter campaign that I ran a couple of months ago for my video series helped cover most of the costs of my attending, including getting a new camera and the flight to Paros. However, I soon realised that there is a lot more to film than just gameplay runthroughs at the event. There is a vibrant board game culture in Greece - publishing, collecting, but above all, playing, and I want to cover this in my video series! And if this campaign funds, I'll be able to spend more time in Athens and make even *more* videos. 
This can be accomplished if a bunch of like-minded board game geeks join me for the Cardboard & Sun event in Paros, because BoardGameTravel.com (the event organizer) has allowed me to set up my own group, giving me a generous discount that I can pass on to you! 
So success with this project means I be able to film and broadcast more content about Greek gaming culture.  What will that look like?
 
The Project
For examples of the sorts of boardgaming videos I've been doing so far, you can check my youtube page at youtube.com/rahdo.
So that's what I've done so far, but now I'd be doing something new for me, a bit more like a documentary, covering the growing Greek boardgame culture.  Visiting boardgame cafes like Playhouse, Playce, and Playtime and awesome stores like Playscape.

Greek boardgame culture is exploding, and I want to cover it!

 
The Goal
Why is the goal £2765?
Originally, I had set up this campaign on Kickstarter, with a goal of getting 10 folks to join us in Paros, for a total of fund target of £3950.  During that brief KS campaign, a number of people got a chance to pledge, and all was well.  However, due to some obscure Kickstarter rules that I wasn't aware of when I started (it's not allowed to offer travel options as rewards, apparently), Kickstarter suspended that campaign.  BUT, BoardGameTravel.com still honoured their commitment to those early pledgers, and so now we only need 7 more to make our goal! 
Why is this a flexible funding campaign?
Because anyone who contributes will want to arrange their flights to Athens as soon as possible, to make sure that they get the best airfare. As for the previous backers, BoardGameTravel.com has told me that they will honour this rate for you until June 30, no matter what happens, so you are free to book your flights!
 
The Rewards
So what do you, the backer get, as your backer reward?  Well, let's talk about about the Cardboard & Sand event! :)

Well, for starters, designer Touko Tahkokallio, the award winning designer of Eclipse will be the special guest star. Fans of Eclipse won’t want to miss the chance to play one of the top rated games in the world with the game’s creator, and I'm looking forward to interviewing him about his experiences in making games and what we can expect from him in the future!

The many games of Touko Tahkokallio!

But wait, there’s more!
Boardgame publishers Portal Games and Ignacy Trzewiczek are co-sponsoring the event, and have promised to send many of Portal's Games, and even organizing a Neuroshima Hex tournament!
As if that wasn't enough, another exciting reason to attend is that Touko has designed a game especially for the event: Thermopyles, which will be produced in a very limited quantity, for the participants of the event.
By pledging, you get not only the game, but you join me for a fantastic week on the Greek island of Paros, with access to an incredible library of some of the best boardgames ever, along with a bunch of like-minded board game geeks to play with. All the fun of a convention, but in an intimate Mediterranean paradise.
Please read the BoardGameTravel.com website for all terms and conditions, and feel free to ask them if you have any questions.
 
Inclusions

A welcome package in the form of a game box (Agricola-size) containing Thermopyles, a game by Touko Tahkokallio, a t-shirt, maps and information about Paros, promotional offers from our partners, discounts on board game related products and services, and more.

 The Game

THIS... IS... SPARTA!

Thermopyles is a co-op card game that can be quite tough to beat, where players take on the role of the brave 300 Spartans who stood against the invading Persian army at the Thermopyles pass. But rather than tell you about the game you'll be getting by backing this project, I figured I'd show it to you - soon I will have a PnP copy in hand and will make a Rahdo Runthrough of it!
It's a nice little game - a great light filler to play between other games, or even play solo instead of Klondike - so if you'd like to see this game made and in your hands, you might want to consider a trip to the Greek isles!

Paros, it doesn't get much nicer than this!
Joining us will be accomplished designer Touko Tahkokallio, most famous for being the creator of Eclipse. Touko has also designed a board game especially for the occasion of the trip, which will be given to every participant, as a limited-edition print.
There is no set itinerary, and everyone is free to explore the island, go to the beach, shop and eat, or just play board games the whole time.

There is a lot that you can do for us. And there are some things that we can do for you as well.Buffalo Bill's Great Show is coming up soon!

And Buffalo Bill himself is out to recruit only the 
greatest names he can find. Those who are famous - or infamous - for their 
outstanding abilities and achievements.
You are dreaming to be a part of 
the show since you were a little boy. Now a feeling in your guts is telling you - this is the time to finally put your
 name on the top of the list. 
You can't wait to show that you are the best shooter and
 gambler, to win the ladies' hearts, find gold and treasures, and become rich and 
famous. 
Game Basics
Bust'em Bandits is an HTML5 based pinball game for mobile devices. It has a 2D game 
engine and a top down pseudo 3D view. The theme of the game is the old 
wild west. The story starts in the streets of a small old west town. 
From there it will lead the player to various scenarios on different subtables.We aim to create a modern pinball game with 2d illustrations, 3d animated gameplay elements, 
and various effects like particles. It will still have the flair of a traditional mechanical 
machine in respect to sound and table elements. To make it appealing to a wider group of players there will also be 
options to activate or deactivate certain features. * An asterisk for the iOS version. We plan to publish the game for iOS in a second step shortly after Android.11.000 € - Initial Game VersionIf we reach our initial funding goal you will get the basic version of the game which contains three settings: the VILLAGE (maintable), the SALOON, & the  PRAIRIE.14.000 € (or more)ONLINE HIGH SCORE TABLE - This first stretch goal will give you a free and unlimited subscription to our online high score table that resembles an old wild west newspaper and contains all your game events. The best players will make the biggest headlines and the most interesting stories. Don't miss out on the next issue!17.000 € (or more)New scenario: the JAIL - Some bandits are asking for your help! They were arrested by the sheriff and are now rotting in an . By helping us to reach the above amount you will be able to sneak into the building and free them. But be aware not to be arrested yourself!20.000 € (or more)New scenario: the BANK - If you ever wanted to rob a bank then this your chance! If you help us to reach the above amount we will grant you access to this highly protected area.23.500 € (or more)A FIGURINE for your desktop or shelf - At this point we will start producing our first real figurine. This amount will cover only the production costs. We will sell them (at a fair price) through our online store.We
 haven't decided yet which of the characters will be the first. Actually
 our idea is to let YOU decide. Not now, but at some later time, when we
 know more.After reaching all these goals we still have enough on our minds.Please come back again to check for updates.Our characters are a vital part of the game as they tell big parts of the story and interact with the player. You will get to know them better in the game. Until then we will give you brief introductions on a regular basis.After the initial
 set of three key characters we are going to publish one 
additional character per week. So don't forget to come back to get to 
know them as early as possible!
NEW characters are showing up EVERY SATURDAY!
Listen to the Sheriff!
Listen to Blaze!
Listen to Shirley Star!
I'll talk to you later, boss!
Come visit our village to hear me.
Will try to speak for some dollars!
I'm no man of big words.
Words are smoke and mirrors.
Caramba! Talk to you in town...

<h3>What IS DMQuests?</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Ginzo Milani, I am an indie developer working on DMQuests as my second ""Official"" job..My first being a site called McHosts which put it simply had run servers for the popular game minecraft! I was in highschool back then( last year ) and although sales were good, I didn't have enough time to invest into it (grades dropping) which although unfortunate was not the end of the world. My plan was to expand McHosts into a gaming company, revolutionalize what we consider video games and even though that plan had subsided, my plan to create a gaming company hasn't! Now that I'm freshly out of Highschool and in college, I had a real smack to the face as to having $0 (okay no I have a student loan so it's more like -$2,000) feels like...it sucks. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me as I am a student, I currently do not have a job simply because my main skills revolve around using computers (let's face it no one wants to hire someone without a degree, and to be honest I'd rather use my computer skills to help me make money than work at a fast food joint) and I wish to request for some funds to help expand the servers. I have used McHosts back up revenue and invested into DMQuests and even put some of my personal money left over from student loan, but unfortunately it's not enough to cover fees for servers, contracts and legal rights (this is pretty much what the money is being used to cover it).</p>
<p>With a little donation, you can help me bring forth this site, as it is a part of my dream. I have always wanted to create my own video game when I was younger and looking back I think to myself; well yeah maybe it wasn't likely with technology back then but I can make it possible. My goal is to make everyone's capability of creating their own interactive gaming experience and create stories of excitement, possible. With this site, I am hoping to expand the roleplaying community and help them feel more interactive and raise the bar for RPing standards.</p>

<h3>So where does the money go?</h3>
<p>-Around $2,000 is going to go into legal documentations(I was surprised at legal costs to be honest)</p>
<p>-$1,500 is going into getting spanking strong servers so gameplay will never be laggy</p>
<p>-$1,000 will go into contracting designers and advertisement for the beta start up</p>
<p>-The remainder, if ANY(I  really plan to throw the full money into the site, I really want this to be up and running, so worst case scenario if the site is done, I'll just create an ingame shop to pay off student loans) will be used to help pay off my student loan so I can focus more on finishing the site</p>
<h3>What do I get for donating?</h3>
<p>-You will get a personal thank you note from me via email, and if you want you can get to know me. </p>
<p>-You get to be a part of the closed beta group</p>
<p>-You get a special limited edition banner around your avatar indicating ""you donated before it was cool""</p>
<p>-You get an achievement for donating</p>
<p>-You can help create the pallette for donator colors (Just pick a hex color and walla, you also get this free of course)</p>
<p>-IF you go all the way, I will perma unlock your account and give you access to every single item that will be released in the shop and released in the future forever!</p>
<h3>Where do the funds go if the goal isn't reached?</h3>
<p>Simply put, I am going to pay for legal documentations FIRST, and after that upgrading servers. From there I will personally work on the designs as my own personal designing skills are not that but, however it will set back as to how far open beta will be open to the public. Closed beta will still be available to all users donating, regardless of if the goal is reached or not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How much is my dollar worth to you?</h3>
<p>For every dollar you donate, it will literally bring me a day closer to the initial goal for when I plan to release it, it also brings me closer to helping me reach my career. It will help bring out hopefully the best engine there is, and bring forth a new generation in RPing which will hopefully stray people from the constant shooter games and more into the story telling we once loved as children.</p>
<p>I believe that upon releasing this site, it will help me launch forth to the community that the world should NOT be about money but rather about the game it's self. A product shouldn't be closed so the community cannot test it, if they paid for it..let them go crazy, that's what I believe. Hell, let them go crazy if they didn't pay for it! Let the world discover and expand together rather than alone. </p>
<p>I'm hoping with my simple SITE, it will show people that all it takes is a good idea, freedom and allowing creativity to be expressed to make a good game.</p>
<p>Games like minecraft, Lego, and playdough have all been an motivator to my mindset and I've always wondered why others don't follow that theme. After all they are literally top sellers.</p>
<p>I have in the past tried to recreate a similar theme with my McHosts being super cheap and affordable so any one could get a server ($10 for 1gb..now days it's a lot cheaper such as $8 for 1gb but back then prices were as high as $30 for 1gb and average at $20 for 1gb), I have also made just other random things outside of developing such as videos on my youtube.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/monckey100"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youtube.com/monckey100</a></p>
<p>I really like to create and I hope with your understanding, you will allow the world to help create their own game as well, and perhaps together we can one day roleplay together fighting dracula's two headed dog, goobers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word, perhaps this may not be your thing, perhaps you've never played DnD before, but that shouldn't be a reason not to, if just one person on your friends list saw what this was and understood what it was, they could singlehandedly create an RPG for you( or you create the rpg your self if you wish) and make you the star, the pet or even the donkey! It really is all up to you, you could even be the evil villian no one likes but secretly was the good guy the whole time.</p>

This is a better example of what your map can look like, but of course the possibilities are endless and you can really put any image you want!

What IS DMQuests?
Hello, My name is Ginzo Milani, I am an indie developer working on DMQuests as my second ""Official"" job..My first being a site called McHosts which put it simply had run servers for the popular game minecraft! I was in highschool back then( last year ) and although sales were good, I didn't have enough time to invest into it (grades dropping) which although unfortunate was not the end of the world. My plan was to expand McHosts into a gaming company, revolutionalize what we consider video games and even though that plan had subsided, my plan to create a gaming company hasn't! Now that I'm freshly out of Highschool and in college, I had a real smack to the face as to having $0 (okay no I have a student loan so it's more like -$2,000) feels like...it sucks.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong><br/><br/>Kacie (24) and Caleigh (23) hail from Sharon, Ontario, Canada and are both recent university graduates.  Kacie was pursuing a medicine career having completed her MCAT, and Caleigh, a career in teaching.  Having been involved in Beach Volleyball for many years, and as members of Team Canada, both have opted to put these careers on hold, in order to pursue their dream of representing their country at the 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto, Canada as well as the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. </p>
<p>We're grateful for this opportunity to come to the public to join us on our journey, because we believe we have the best fans in the world!  To compete on the FIVB world tour, a typical season costs approximately $25,000 per athlete. Currently, we are both being supported by our families and working part time jobs in order to compete for our country.</p>
<p>Any funds you can contribute would help us immensly, by allowing us to focus on training, achieving our dreams and reaching our potential.  Your kindness and generosity will be appreciated beyond measure, and even if you can't give financially, we are so thankful for your support and encouragement! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
In order to be a national team member we are required to participate in a minimum of 14 international and national competitions every season, which we fund ourselves.  This calls for booking flights, hotels, accommodations, uniform gear, registration fees and support staff (coaching and physiotherapists).  Up until this point, we have not been able to have a support staff with us, as costs are too high.
<p>For your contribution, we're happy to offer the following items listed on the right hand panel.</p>
<p>We have competed as a team since January 2013, and have competed in three international events to date.  In Mexico we won our first event and in Guatemala, we took home the gold medal and are looking for more!  </p>

I miss the days where I could buy any $20 game and it would be an adventure. Games were suitable for almost any age and there weren’t really “target audiences.” Every game was good back then, no matter the graphics style, music, character design, etc. Everything was just good. I want to bring that back with this game. 

-Main Protagonist, Breeze the Corgi
This game is about a corgi named Breeze and his adventure to return to his owner, while trying to save the sky world after a spree of weird weather patterns. The game will be Action-Adventure Platformer intended for all ages. The game will feature very stylized graphics, memorable music and a memorable tale.
I have formed a team of indie game developers on a volunteer basis that will assist in making this project come to life.
Game Overview 
The information below is pending and is subject to change
·         Genre: Action-Adventure Platformer
·         Target Audience: Intended for all ages 
·         Current Targeted Platforms: PC, Mac, Mobile* 
·         Desired Platform(s): Wii*, PS3, Xbox360
·         Budget: Dependant on Out-of-Pocket, Donations, and Kickstarter funds 
What is this game? 
This game features a young corgi dog named Breeze who is separated from his young owner in an unexpected storm. The dog wakes up to find himself stuck in the clouds. He picks up a bag nearby where he landed and a creature inside called a cloud sprite tells him about the antagonist who is known as The Storm King.                
In order to stop the storms and return home, Breeze, accompanied by the cloud guide, must venture around the world’s skies, help other cloud sprites, and find The Cloud King, the only one who can defeat The Storm King. The player will play as Breeze and the game will play like a traditional 3D platformer with a combination of action-based combat. 
Where does the game take place? 

-Artwork By Concept Artist, Anna KoanThe game takes place in the Earth’s outer atmospheres, primarily the ones where clouds are abundant. Due to the fictional nature of the story, Breeze sees the sky different from humans. Animals on earth are able to see more than humans are. The skies above earth have mystical creatures called sprites, and they assist the Cloud King and the Storm King. There are also various other creatures in the sky that have their own purpose.

Many locations have hidden environments in the clouds, but are not visible to humans such as Sky Forests, deserts and oceans. There are also areas that Breeze can access that reach the clouds such as mountaintops, currents, funnels and the top of aerial vessels such as planes.
What do I control? 
 Throughout the whole game, you will play as Breeze the corgi.
What is the main focus? 
The player will travel across the skies, defeating sky monsters, solving problems in the clouds that are causing problems down on earth, collect items that will help you continue on your journey and defeat the Storm King so you can get the Cloud king to send you back home. The Impact This Game Will Make
The completion of this game will offer a quality game for gamers out there that was created by an indie team. During the production of this game, we will keep our fans suggestions in mind. We also want to show the developers the power of a courageous and determined team. This will also give all the team members a large amount of experience and exposure. 
What We Need & What You Get
As the cost of game production can get steep, we need funding to keep this production cycle rolling. Currently, the project is only funded out of pocket. The first thing we want to acquire are Pro licenses of the development tool, Unity3D. We also will use the funds to pay for web hosting, file hosting, and any extra software we may need for production. The funding will also be used to purchasing any additional assets we might not be able to create ourselves.
In reward for those who pledge, not only will you receive a quality game, every backer will receive a personalized Thank You Letter, sent by Breeze himself :)

<p>Any problem can be solved with a proper application of perseverance and communication.  But both perseverance and communication take time.  Punching Things! may run into delays in the time it takes to code, the production of art, or the creation of the soundtrack.  As long as everyone is willing to wait I will do everything I can to make sure Punching Things! sees the light of day.</p>

Check out his stuff below!35$ - Will go to pay the IndieGoGo fee.The rest of the funding will be used for any other expenses that might arise in the purchase of the above products.If the goal is not reached than certain features will not be added.  See the above section for an exact breakdown of where the funding is going.Stretch GoalsAll of the stretch goals listed below are features I would like to add to the game given the time and the money.  If you have any opinions on these features or would like to see other features created don't hesitate to make a comment.  All amounts listed are rough estimates and may require more money that want is listed.300$ - Purchasing Natural Voice software from AT&TIf you like the voices used in the original demo above, vote on Facebook to say you want to keep the original voice.  If you don't like the original voice, put your vote on the Facebook page.  The main benefit of the Natural Voice software is that the Text to Speech can say player names to be used for a dynamic announcer to comment on the gameplay.500$ - Grabs, Throws, JumpingThese robots got hops!  Or at least jet packs.  Bounce enemies all over the battlefield with the help of verticality.  Grab your foe and toss him at your other foes.  Get rough with your enemies and show them who's boss.250$ - Single Screen Cooperative PlayGrab a friend and a controller and beat baddies together.  Become a dynamic duo of death and destroy the denizens of the arena.500$ - Dynamic LevelsLevels become hazardous.  They may fill with water, fall apart, or become covered in ice.  You and your enemies will have to tread lightly to survive the dangers.500$ - LootThe arena will be filled with many items to interact with that can be used to beat the wires out of your opponents.  The battlefield will also be littered with behavior modifying computer chips changing how you attack.  Some may make your fist more powerful or other may make you move faster.???? - Online multiplayer, Punching Things OnlineThere aren't too many beat'em'ups online especially after Dungeon Fighter Online took it's North American server down.  I would love to fill that void with an Massive Multiplayer Online version of Punching Things!  In Punching Things Online! (PTO!) every boss is replaced with a actual player.  Players will have to climb the ranks to become the ultimate champion and then defend their title.  They will create their own minions to help them and their own levels other players must defeat before they can fight.  This stretch goal is my ultimate goal for Punching Things! and I have many ideas for how I could make this game work as an MMO.What do I get?""You oily bastard!""All perks include the previous perk2$ - For contributing you'll receive a thank you email from me5$ - At five dollars you'll receive access to the game in alpha and beta and you'll get the finished game.10$ - At ten dollars you'll receive a digital art book chronicling the transformation of the art of the game.25$ - At twenty five dollars you'll get to design your own robotic denizen to live (and die) in the world of Punching Things!  Design the art and personality along with any dialogue you want your robot to say. (Try to keep it clean)50$ - At fifty dollars you can voice your robot, although you'll have to send me the voice samples.  You'll also receive a small poster with a image of Clunk battling his robotic brethren.100$ - At one hundred dollars you'll have a significant hand in designing a level in the game.  Help create the art for the level, the enemies that will inhabit the space, and the sounds that will be heard there.What else have you worked on?Check out my portfolio here.  Just download the folder and unzip it to check out the awesome stuff inside.  (Make sure your firewall doesn't block it)https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48147163/Portfolio.zipCheck out Mal's artwork in the gallery section.Listen to Josiah's rad music on Soundcloud.https://soundcloud.com/requiemforaheart/garden-city-showdownhttps://soundcloud.com/requiemforaheart/struggle-beneath-the-icehttps://soundcloud.com/requiemforaheartWhat else can I do to help?

""You malfunctioning scum!""Tell everyone and anyone about the game.  Share this campaign on Facebook.  Tweet about it.  Post it on Reddit.  Use IndieGoGo's sharing tools to help with doing so.

Also, I would love to hear your feedback.  Write your feedback on the Facebook page.  Add comments to Youtube.  Spam this page with your ideas about the game.  I want the creation of the game to be a collaborative process and your feedback will be taken into account when I am making the game.



What if you run into problems?

Any problem can be solved with a proper application of perseverance and communication.  But both perseverance and communication take time.  Punching Things! may run into delays in the time it takes to code, the production of art, or the creation of the soundtrack.  As long as everyone is willing to wait I will do everything I can to make sure Punching Things! sees the light of day.

<p>During wrestling season, I rush from classes to wrestling practice before finally getting home for dinner. But like most kids going from 7am to 5pm, I need real, substantial snacks and meals to get me through the day. Unfortunately, chips from the vending machine aren’t nutritious enough, and granola bars just aren’t substantial enough. During wrestling practice last season, I realized I wasn’t the only one who needed something nutritious and convenient.. High school kids, college students, fitness buffs, busy professionals, and exhausted parents all need something convenient, quick, nutritious, and substantial. That’s why I’m developing Fresh&amp;Blended, a smoothie vending machine that uses real fruit, vegetables, and protein to create freshly made smoothies.</p>
<p>Bringing together nutrition and convenience can be a challenge. Smoothies are one of the best ways to get a lot of nutrition fast. But they don’t travel well, you can’t make them ahead of time, and they can be a pain to make and clean up, even when you’re at home. But Fresh&amp;Blended fixes all that. Smoothies become an easy, fast, and convenient choice to get you through your busy day. By allowing customers to choose from different frozen fruit combinations, and allows them to blend it with their choice of milk or juice, you can get your daily banana-strawberry-orange juice smoothie fix or a grab a blueberry-milk-protein smoothie on your workout day.</p>
<p>This campaign will help fund the development of the Fresh&amp;Blended smoothie vending machine. With your help, we can build a prototype, begin manufacturing, and start to get Fresh&amp;Blended into schools, gyms, and other locations near you.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>I know that you work hard for your money, so I want you to know that the contributions will be used wisely.  The reason Indiegogo was chosen for this campaign is because even though the goal will hopefully be met, any amount will help to get this idea going forward! Here’s a breakdown of the the finances; be aware that extra costs have been added in for tax reasons and to make sure all the great perks can be fulfilled!  </p>
<p>The initial building of this machine is expensive, but once it’s built and we’ve perfected the process, cost will drop substantially (Estimated cost $40,000) </p>
<p>We need to make sure there are plenty of delicious (and healthy!) flavor options in the machines to choose from (Estimated cost $4,500)</p>
<p>Once we have the flavors developed and machines built, we will need to have some initial inventory to help stock the machines (Estimated cost $5,500)</p>
<p>We need to be able to pay the bills and fees, including running this campaign, licensing, and legal fees (Estimated cost $6,000)</p>
<p>As with any venture there are always unforeseen costs, whether it’s a problem with the shipping, or something happens at the factory, they will always be there, and since failing to plan is planning to fail, we want to make sure that any of those issues won’t hinder a project as special as this (Estimated cost $4,000)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for supporting and sharing this project! There are some great perks (listed on the right side) to help thank you for your contributions.  Since you can’t have your own personal machine (bummer, right?) the perks tie back into the project in many ways.  You can get anything from your choice of Fresh&amp;Blended t-shirts, to even naming one of the smoothies!  If the goal is exceeded this will further speed along the process and will allow you to have smoothie vending machines in your community even sooner.</p><div>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Many of us want to be healthy and eat well, but find ourselves limited by a lack of convenient choices. Fresh&amp;Blended changes that. By bringing fruit, vegetables, and protein into workplaces, schools, and gyms (the places where we are busiest), Fresh&amp;Blended makes nutrition the easy choice. </p>
<p>What’s even better is that you actually see the nutrition you’re getting—you can see the cups of fruit and vegetables that get blended together. There’s no added sugar like other smoothie products. Fruit, vegetables, and juice or milk—plain and simple. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we all know what happens when we don’t get the nutrition we need when we need it. We don’t get that personal best time. We can’t focus during that important meeting. We lose our patience at the worst times. We forget answers on a test. Nutrition is important to doing well in school, during work, at home, and in the gym. Fresh&amp;Blended makes sure that we can be our best when we need to be. And Fresh&amp;Blended makes that nutrition fast, easy, and convenient.</p>
<p>Fresh&amp;Blended’s unique smoothie vending machines are perfect for places like:</p>
<p><b>Fitness Centers</b></p>
<p><b>Schools</b></p>
<p><b>Work Places</b></p>
<p><b>Libraries</b></p>
<p><b>Airports </b></p>
<p><b>and endless other possibilities!</b></p>
<p>With these vending machines, everyone can have a nutritious and convenient snack or meal.</p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div>
<p>Turning a raw concept into a large scaled project is no easy task. But I have the expertise, experience, and commitment to overcome any challenges.</p>
<p>Expertise: I’ve taken numerous business classes, including the Kaufman FastTrac class for entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Experience: I come from a long line of entrepreneurs and business owners, including my father and grandfather. I know what it takes to get a business off the ground, and I have an extensive support network in place to help me do just that.</p>
<p>Commitment: Not having healthy options available matters in my everyday life at school—and I know it matters to thousands of other professionals, fitness buffs, and busy parents. We need healthy options that are convenient in order to stay healthy and be our best. I’m committed to making that a reality with Fresh&amp;Blended. </p><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

<p><span>The

an unauthorized derivative copy of a model belonging
to Privateer Press. We are now working to replace it with new troll 
model that will be totally original. In the event that you made a pledge
 based entirely on the infringing model we were previously offering we 
suggest either bearing with us while we create
this new model or withdrawal your pledge at that level. </span></p>

<li>
<strong>The Client</strong> - that you can download from the store.</li>
<li>
<strong>Server(s)</strong> for hosting a game world or game rooms.</li>
<li>
<strong> A Database </strong>that stores all the data about users - when your game is more competitive it becomes more attractive to cheaters. When someone cheats in a single player game that's his own business, but in a multiplayer game it can harm the other players that want to have a fair game. In order to keep it fair, everything should be validated and stored on the server side.</li>
<li> <strong>A web service</strong> as a bridge between the game server and database. It can also be used by a client to login to the game or retrieve some information about a player or the game itself.</li>
</ol><p>Of course, that is just a general overview on architecture.</p><p>Multiplayer gameplay leads us to a whole new bunch of technical issues and, even if you know about them, this process takes time.<br/>Testing 4-part architecture with at least two clients is very time consuming.</p><p>The first technical challenge is the problem of scale. Mobile games have tons of players and if all of these players want to play a multiplayer mode we have to host rooms for all of them simultaneously. Hosting is expensive in general and private servers or peer-to-peer is not a solution in each type of game. So the question is: “How many players can we handle simultaneously on a single server?” The answer is never obvious - it depends.</p><p>Is your game world persistent? What part of gameplay can you perform on the client side - if any? What latency is acceptable? How do you want to pay for this latency - how do you want to hide it from the user?</p><p>As you can imagine in the case of Volleyball Championship there are a lot of concurrent players and latency is practically unacceptable. If you serve a ball with a speed of 140km/h it doesn’t give your opponent much time to react so each incident of latency can lead you to some unplayable results.</p><p>Now imagine that you have to host such gameplay for thousands of active players on a single server and you need a couple of servers populated around the world to provide a reasonable experience to as many players as possible. </p><p>Obviously you can’t make everybody happy, but as a game developer you want to. </p><p>Despite all the technical issues that you can face - lost packages, client side prediction, lost connection, latency, problems of scale etc. - you can picture the reasons why developing a multiplayer game can be real pain in the neck. Each bug, each change has to be propagated to the server, to the clients and tested again through the network and it takes a lot of time.</p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564999217/pfzn02osufoxsmwb1qbg.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>You can not support us financially?

Apart from obvious things like more exciting gameplay and lots of fun, this project is important for us because it was YOUR IDEA.Volleyball Championship fans have been asking for a multiplayer mode for some time now.We thought, why not? We decided to finally make it a reality.Because our fans, the Volleyball Championship fans, are very important to us, we want the Volleyball Championship MULTIPLAYER to also be a freemium game.That's why we hope you will help us change your great idea into a reality.If successful, Volleyball Championship MULTIPLAYER will certainly be updated as frequently as possible. In the future we want to give you the opportunity to play tournaments, create leagues... and what else? We're listening!  Creating a game is a long and tedious process.In a single player game, it’s a standalone application that executes on our local machine, sometimes it talks with an external source of data like Google’s Firebase.However, a multiplayer game often divides our development and application architecture into 4 parts instead of 1.

The Client - that you can download from the store.

Server(s) for hosting a game world or game rooms.

 A Database that stores all the data about users - when your game is more competitive it becomes more attractive to cheaters. When someone cheats in a single player game that's his own business, but in a multiplayer game it can harm the other players that want to have a fair game. In order to keep it fair, everything should be validated and stored on the server side.
 A web service as a bridge between the game server and database. It can also be used by a client to login to the game or retrieve some information about a player or the game itself.
Of course, that is just a general overview on architecture.Multiplayer gameplay leads us to a whole new bunch of technical issues and, even if you know about them, this process takes time.Testing 4-part architecture with at least two clients is very time consuming.The first technical challenge is the problem of scale. Mobile games have tons of players and if all of these players want to play a multiplayer mode we have to host rooms for all of them simultaneously. Hosting is expensive in general and private servers or peer-to-peer is not a solution in each type of game. So the question is: “How many players can we handle simultaneously on a single server?” The answer is never obvious - it depends.Is your game world persistent? What part of gameplay can you perform on the client side - if any? What latency is acceptable? How do you want to pay for this latency - how do you want to hide it from the user?As you can imagine in the case of Volleyball Championship there are a lot of concurrent players and latency is practically unacceptable. If you serve a ball with a speed of 140km/h it doesn’t give your opponent much time to react so each incident of latency can lead you to some unplayable results.Now imagine that you have to host such gameplay for thousands of active players on a single server and you need a couple of servers populated around the world to provide a reasonable experience to as many players as possible. Obviously you can’t make everybody happy, but as a game developer you want to. Despite all the technical issues that you can face - lost packages, client side prediction, lost connection, latency, problems of scale etc. - you can picture the reasons why developing a multiplayer game can be real pain in the neck. Each bug, each change has to be propagated to the server, to the clients and tested again through the network and it takes a lot of time. You can not support us financially? That's alright.You can always help by sending a link to our campaign to all your friends.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

Naturen är kall och karg och hård. Äta eller ätas. Hjärnsvampar och kudzu och rabies och botflugor som lägger ägg under huden.</p><p>I Rotsystem har det här dragits till sin spets; världens växter har bildat ett globalt nätverk som blivit självmedvetet och hotar att utplåna mänskligheten.</p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Vi har dragit oss tillbaks från omvärlden och gömmer oss i gigantiska städer-i-byggnader som kallas arkologier. Grönskan använder radiosignaler för att kommunicera. Därför är ingen radiokommunikation säker. Grönskan hackar datornätverk med enkelhet, förvränger röster... det finns de som blivit galna av att lyssna på Grönskans brus. Verktyg som GPS, bluetooth, trådlösa 
nätverk, RFID-taggar, och mobiltelefoner har förpassats till historien, 
eller blivit ett hot.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I arkologin styr megakorporationerna, som fått förnyad makt när mänskligheten återigen har brist på mat, brist på energi, brist på utrymme. Resurserna finns därute, där Grönskan regerar, och företagens rovdrift vänder sig nu istället inåt.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Rotsystem är ett rollspel i en retrocyberpunkig framtid, där man frångått trådlösa nätverk och istället använder välskyddade kablar. Internet finns inte längre. Livet i arkologin liknar på många sätt den framtid cyberpunkens giganter drömde om under 80-talet. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Rollpersonerna är frilansande problemlösare som anlitas av megaföretag eller andra som behöver lösa problem utan att vilja använda sina egna resurser. Uppdragen kan vara av alla möjliga slag, till exempel </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">inbrott, datastöld, lönnmord, livvaktsuppdrag, kidnappningar, fritagningar, brottsutredningar eller farliga expeditioner ut i världen utanför arkologins skyddande väggar.</span></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">En intressant och djup spelvärld som kombinerar det bästa från retrocyberpunk och grön postapokalyps.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Ett snabbt och enkelt regelsystem, som är lätt att lära sig.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Ett fantasieggande system för att skapa rollpersoner, som ger dig en färdig rollperson med bakgrund och utrustning på under en halvtimme.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Vackra illustrationer som levandegör och skapar inlevelse.</span></li>
</ul><p></p><h1>Kort om mig</h1><p>Jag heter Mikael Bergström, och jag älskar att göra spel. Tidigare har 
jag skrivit och givit ut rollspelen <a href=""http://www.evolutionensbarn.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evolutionens Barn</a>, <a href=""http://www.nullstate.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Null State</a> och <a href=""http://www.morethanhuman.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">More than Human</a>. Jag har också byggt berättarspelet <a href=""http://www.urverkspel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131&amp;Itemid=112"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VÄRMEDÖD</a>.<br/></p><p>Alla utom More than Human är tryckta via print-on-demand, vilket innebär att det inte blir några 
lagerkostnader eller liknande eftersom spelen trycks när en beställning
 görs. Den tekniken kommer också att användas för att trycka Rotsystem. Jag släpper dessutom alla mina spel med en Creative 
Commonslicens, så de är gratis att ladda ner.<br/></p><h1>Vad pengarna går till</h1><p>Eftersom jag skriver all text själv, så finns egentligen fyra utgiftsposter för mina rollspelsprojekt:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Marknadsföring; </b>tryck av affisher, recensionsexemplar till tidningar, T-shirts och så vidare.</li>
<li>
<b>Illustrationer;</b> den överlägset största utgiften så länge man trycker via print on demand. Hittills har jag beställt illustrationer för omkring 16 000 för mina egna pengar; med er hjälp hoppas jag kunna köpa in ännu fler och göra spelet ännu snyggare.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Tryck;</b> vid print on demand ligger grundkostnaden för trycket mycket lågt; under tusenlappen.</li>
<li>
<b>Omkostnader;</b> IndieGoGo tar 4% om crowdfundern lyckas, och sedan tar också PayPal 3-4% i överföringskostnad.</li>
</ul><p>Först och främst kommer alltså dina pengar att gå till inköp av illustrationer, men de kommer också göra det enklare för mig att marknadsföra spelet. Jag vill framför allt hålla en hög produktionskvalitet, både vad gäller illustrationer och tryck.<br/></p><h1>Bonusmål</h1><p>Vad händer om vi uppnår crowdfunderns målsumma? Jo, vi börjar jobba mot de här bonusmålen, såklart.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/341762/files/20140131153529-Bonusm_l-grafik-m_l3.jpg?1391211329"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div style=""padding: 1em; padding-top: .1em; padding-top: 1em; overflow: auto; text-align: justify; border-radius: .5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"">

Om vi samlar ihop 900 euro så kommer jag att ha råd att köpa loss den. Isåfall kommer den precis som övriga illustrationer göras tillgänglig under Creative Commons BY-licens.

Dessutom tillkommer en ""gäng-generator"" som hjälper dig att både skapa egna kriminella gäng genom att slumpa eller välja saker ur listor samt tips och instruktioner för hur du själv kan använda dig av gäng i din kampanj!

There's a short project description in english at the very end.RotsystemNaturen är inte god. Naturen är inte, och har aldrig varit, i balans. Naturen är kall och karg och hård. Äta eller ätas. Hjärnsvampar och kudzu och rabies och botflugor som lägger ägg under huden.I Rotsystem har det här dragits till sin spets; världens växter har bildat ett globalt nätverk som blivit självmedvetet och hotar att utplåna mänskligheten.Vi har dragit oss tillbaks från omvärlden och gömmer oss i gigantiska städer-i-byggnader som kallas arkologier. Grönskan använder radiosignaler för att kommunicera. Därför är ingen radiokommunikation säker. Grönskan hackar datornätverk med enkelhet, förvränger röster... det finns de som blivit galna av att lyssna på Grönskans brus. Verktyg som GPS, bluetooth, trådlösa 
nätverk, RFID-taggar, och mobiltelefoner har förpassats till historien, 
eller blivit ett hot.I arkologin styr megakorporationerna, som fått förnyad makt när mänskligheten återigen har brist på mat, brist på energi, brist på utrymme. Resurserna finns därute, där Grönskan regerar, och företagens rovdrift vänder sig nu istället inåt.Rotsystem är ett rollspel i en retrocyberpunkig framtid, där man frångått trådlösa nätverk och istället använder välskyddade kablar. Internet finns inte längre. Livet i arkologin liknar på många sätt den framtid cyberpunkens giganter drömde om under 80-talet. Rollpersonerna är frilansande problemlösare som anlitas av megaföretag eller andra som behöver lösa problem utan att vilja använda sina egna resurser. Uppdragen kan vara av alla möjliga slag, till exempel inbrott, datastöld, lönnmord, livvaktsuppdrag, kidnappningar, fritagningar, brottsutredningar eller farliga expeditioner ut i världen utanför arkologins skyddande väggar.
En intressant och djup spelvärld som kombinerar det bästa från retrocyberpunk och grön postapokalyps.

Ett snabbt och enkelt regelsystem, som är lätt att lära sig.


Ett fantasieggande system för att skapa rollpersoner, som ger dig en färdig rollperson med bakgrund och utrustning på under en halvtimme.

Vackra illustrationer som levandegör och skapar inlevelse.
Kort om migJag heter Mikael Bergström, och jag älskar att göra spel. Tidigare har 
jag skrivit och givit ut rollspelen Evolutionens Barn, Null State och More than Human. Jag har också byggt berättarspelet VÄRMEDÖD.Alla utom More than Human är tryckta via print-on-demand, vilket innebär att det inte blir några 
lagerkostnader eller liknande eftersom spelen trycks när en beställning
 görs. Den tekniken kommer också att användas för att trycka Rotsystem. Jag släpper dessutom alla mina spel med en Creative 
Commonslicens, så de är gratis att ladda ner.Vad pengarna går tillEftersom jag skriver all text själv, så finns egentligen fyra utgiftsposter för mina rollspelsprojekt:

Marknadsföring; tryck av affisher, recensionsexemplar till tidningar, T-shirts och så vidare.

Illustrationer; den överlägset största utgiften så länge man trycker via print on demand. Hittills har jag beställt illustrationer för omkring 16 000 för mina egna pengar; med er hjälp hoppas jag kunna köpa in ännu fler och göra spelet ännu snyggare.


Tryck; vid print on demand ligger grundkostnaden för trycket mycket lågt; under tusenlappen.

Omkostnader; IndieGoGo tar 4% om crowdfundern lyckas, och sedan tar också PayPal 3-4% i överföringskostnad.
Först och främst kommer alltså dina pengar att gå till inköp av illustrationer, men de kommer också göra det enklare för mig att marknadsföra spelet. Jag vill framför allt hålla en hög produktionskvalitet, både vad gäller illustrationer och tryck.BonusmålVad händer om vi uppnår crowdfunderns målsumma? Jo, vi börjar jobba mot de här bonusmålen, såklart.

Bonusmål 1 (900 Euro): (UPPNÅTT)
Illustration av George Cotronis: Rotsystems framsida är skapad av George Cotronis, och i arbetet med den tog han också fram en extra illustration. Om vi samlar ihop 900 euro så kommer jag att ha råd att köpa loss den. Isåfall kommer den precis som övriga illustrationer göras tillgänglig under Creative Commons BY-licens. Antingen hamnar den som illustration i den här boken, eller så används den som omslag till någon expansion eller liknande.

Bonusmål 2 (1300 Euro): Äventyr och gäng-generator: (UPPNÅTT) Jag skriver ett matigt bonusäventyr till Rotsystem, som fokuserar på kriminella gäng i arkologins laglösa delar. Dessutom tillkommer en ""gäng-generator"" som hjälper dig att både skapa egna kriminella gäng genom att slumpa eller välja saker ur listor samt tips och instruktioner för hur du själv kan använda dig av gäng i din kampanj! Äventyret släpps som separat gratis-PDF på Rotsystems hemsida.
Bonusmål 3 (1500 Euro): Vildmarksäventyr: (UPPNÅTT) Når vi 1500 Euro skriver jag ytterligare en matig äventyrsmodul, den här gången en som fokuserar på vildmarken utanför arkologin, och utforskandet av den förlorade jorden. I denna äventyrsmodul kommer du också att hitta fler faror och komplikationer till dina egna expeditioner, nya äventyrskrokar och nya tips för att få utforskning av farliga miljöer att bli extra spännande och roligt. Äventyret släpps som separat gratis-PDF på Rotsystems hemsida.
Bonusmål 4 (2000 Euro): Tryckt äventyrssupplement: Jag bygger samman de två ovanstående 
äventyren, lägger till några extra äventyr och annat smått och gott, och
 släpper som tryckt produkt. Med andra ord, under 2014 och 2015 skriver 
jag totalt två extraböcker till spelet, som båda trycks i fysisk form.

Utmaningar och riskerDen stora risken med projektet är att jag inte lyckas skriva klart det i tid. Ser man till andra crowdfundade rollspel är förseningar inget ovanligt.Det här är det femte spelet jag skriver, och Rotsystem är inte det mest omfattande av dem. Jag har släppt ett spel varje påsk de senaste fyra åren, och det visar att jag har erfarenheten och kunskaperna som krävs för att slutföra den här sortens projekt, och att göra det i tid.En annan risk är att jag inte har råd att trycka det, eller inte lyckas få ut det i butik. Grundkostnaden för trycket är trivial; det rör sig om under tusenlappen.När det gäller att få ut spelet i butik så har jag två samarbetspartners som sagt att de är villiga att hjälpa till med fakturering och distribution. Skulle den ena dra sig ur så har jag alltså en backupplan. Även om båda mina samarbetspartners skulle dra sig ur så kommer Rotsystem fortfarande att kunna köpas på nätet och på konvent, och alla ni som ska ha ett exemplar av spelet som en belöning för ert stöd kommer att få ert exemplar oavsett vilket.Jag har också eget kapital, som jag kan skjuta till ifall den här crowdfunderns pengar tryter.Andra sätt att hjälpa till

We will be offering branded versions of the VUE with custom skins created by our graphics team for you with the branding of your organization.
We will be offering custom skinning services using the photo that you provide. Do you have a photo that would be the perfect background for your Skybox VUE? We'll make it happen. Hint: This is a GREAT idea for Dad for Father's Day! (Dads - simply share the website www.skyboxscoreboards.com with your family by clicking on the social media buttons!)
 
 


 
 
Status:
I’ve put a management TEAM in place, consisting of a group of highly dedicated and experienced business leaders, committed to bringing the Skybox VUE to sports fans everywhere.
We have successfully built and tested 2 fully functioning prototypes and are currently in the process of designing the first 3 production models for field testing, marketing and pre-sales. 
 

Opportunity - cost – availability

A full product roll-out and official product launch is scheduled prior to the 2014 Baseball Season. We invite you to follow our progress on our website, Twitter, and on our FACEBOOK page
We are working out the details with our manufacturer so we cannot yet provide a price. We can tell you that if you are an avid sports fan, it will no doubt be worth the price!
 

 

 
Call for action / what we need now and for what: 
To get us to the next stage, we need investment funding. We are reaching out to the crowd-funding community to help us bring the Skybox VUE to market. Our goal is to raise $60,000 to pay for;
      - Components, material and tooling
      - Assembly of pre-production units
      - Software development & programming
      - Statistic feed from The Sports Network
      - Marketing
      - UL Testing
 
Direct-investment opportunity:
Skybox VUE also offers an opportunity to direct-invest in this new product. We are actively seeking serious investment partners who share a passion for new technology, and who wish to capitalize on the chance to become part of this exciting product on the front-end. Interested parties may submit inquiries to the Skybox VUE team.  
 

Other Ways You Can Help!
You can help us by funding this project. You can also promote it around you. You can give us your advice on how to improve the Skybox VUE. Let’s make the very best product for all sports enthusiasts!
 

Closing / Thank you
I hope YOU are as excited about the Skybox VUE as we are, and consider participating in our quest to bring it to sports enthusiasts everywhere. We THANK YOU very much for your generous support. With your support you can help finish my journey in making my dream become a reality.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Game Design</u></h3>
<p>Aftermath: The End Game is an open world survival horror that focuses on combat realism, innovative game mechanics, authentic shooting &amp; survival culture, graphical quality, and balanced gameplay. As a PvP player, you will be challenged by Aftermath, however the gameplay is geared towards PvE for several good reasons. The PvE gameplay in Aftermath will allow for PvP to occur naturally as a gameplay decision of risk vs reward rather than the default mode of play, while ensuring PvE is challenging. </p>
<p>You will be pitted against the environment with the added danger of a player element able to pop up at any time, and vice versa. This game design supports the greatest number of play styles and the perpetual double threat looming over your head will make for authentically thrilling gameplay that survival game enthusiasts have been missing out on from the genre for a very long time. PvE gameplay also allows the game to contain truly thrilling and terrifying AI encounters that wouldn't often happen in PvP focused game.<br/><br/>In game audio comms, visual signals, as well as AI detection and spawning mechanics will help to minimize needless ""shoot-on-sight"" gameplay while allowing freedom of choice. Most importantly - it is played exclusively from the first person perspective to eliminate third-person gimmicks and maximize immersion. <br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Visual Quality</u></h3>
<p>A major focus for Aftermath: The End Game has been visual quality. Due to the massive boom in video game technology and the game development market over recent years, achieving fantastic looking assets has never been easier. While many other games in the genre are ageing (and were only bordering on acceptable upon launch), we are future-proofing the development as much as possible by creating high quality assets, and will continue to update and improve as much as possible going forward. We want to develop a game we can be proud of. One that will give you, the player, what you deserve. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Why Aftermath: The End Game Needs You</u></h3>
<p>Development has gotten far through personal funding and a lot of hard work, but it has to go that extra bit farther to make it onto Steam and console as a polished, stable game. We have many custom models such as weapons, characters, vehicles and buildings but there are still plenty more to make and we believe you deserve better than generic marketplace assets!<br/>We have been working with very talented freelancers and will be seeking out an established, successful studio to partner with in order to complete development. Quality animation is a particularly time consuming process and the sheer number of animations required means a big chunk of our funds will go towards this.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Vision</u></h3>
<p>The open world survival genre has transformed the gaming industry in recent years. Probably just like you, the creators of Aftermath: The End Game were captivated by the survival aspects of games like The Forest, Minecraft, ARK: Survival Evolved, Arma 2 mods and many others. There have been many survival titles that have captured the imagination of gamers, however none successfully offer what Aftermath: The End Game will deliver - gorgeous environments, confronting gameplay, terrifying enemies, and intuitive gun mechanics inspired by first person shooters such as Escape From Tarkov, Squad and Insurgency. <br/>Our first map is a gorgeous snowy wilderness which will provide a sense of adventure and isolation. A beautiful 8km x 8km setting marred by horror and hopelessness. Additional map concepts will be larger (15km x 15km or larger) and with Aftermath: The End Game achieving the necessary crowdfunding and launch success, more inventive and aesthetic as the game matures and evolves.<br/>There is a plethora of game mechanics and features to be implemented. Realistic, simulator inspired vehicle mechanics (2WD, 4WD, 6WD, high + low range etc), unique and innovative climb + shoot mechanics (not parkour) and entertaining interactive features like generators for lighting systems &amp; loudspeakers and an in-vehicle sound system that lets you play your own music tracks!<br/><br/>All of this will be complimented by a state-of-the-art web community linked to the game database with a host of features to compliment the interactions of players both in-game and on social media.

Will you be able to beat it?Team up with friendsDiscover the different towers of the Demon FortressCan you beat the dark forces?Pictures from Gamefest at gamesweekberlin 2018. Picture on right by © Grzegorz Karkoszka.Despite having only two controller ports, the NES can be extended with the FourScore multiplayer adapter that allows you to connect up to four controllers. Micro Mages is compatible with this adapter as well as the Hori 4-player adapter released for the Famicom. The NES Satellite wireless 4-player adapter works, too!On the left, the FourScore for the NES; on the right, the Hori adapter for the Famicom Why Indiegogo?This is another chance to get a copy of Micro Mages if you missed our Kickstarter campaign in September. As cartridge production goes, it is necessary for us to know demand in advance, and since many people have just discovered Micro Mages after the end of our September campaign, we opted to use Indiegogo InDemand to make the game available again until we finish the production steps.We have been working meticulously for the past two years to bring you an experience on-par with NES era commercial releases. The game and print data are finished, but it's a special financial challenge to produce cartridges, manuals and boxes in high quantities.Exclusive to the NES version: cartridge, box and instruction bookletComprehensive instruction booklet: hero moves, enemies, worlds and more...We are a two-man team from Berlin, dedicated to bringing new games to old hardware!Julius created Morphcat Games in 2011 when he released the NES demo Super Bat Puncher. He made other games during game jams and also composes music on his free time. On Micro Mages, he did the programming, created tools for data optimization as well as music and sound effects.Nicolas joined Julius during the Ludum Dare 32 game jam and together they created a short NES game named Banana Nana. On Micro Mages, he made the graphics and levels as well as box and manual illustrations. Risks & ChallengesRisk reduction is our highest priority. Thus, finishing the game and print data before launch was an absolute necessity for us. That's right, the game is 100% complete!Naturally, we have thoroughly planned and prepared all the steps required for the game's release. Antoine Gohin of Broke Studio, who successfuly produced and released his own NES homebrew game Twin Dragons, will hande the cartridge production while we will take care of print and shipping.We made sure to add a suitably large buffer to all of our calculations in terms of both financial and time requirements - in case of any unforeseen events.",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b>What is the warranty policy?</b><br/>We stand firmly behind our products. Every ZØRE product comes with a full FIVE years warranty for any manufacturing defects.</p>
<p><b>Is ZØRE X dependent on a smartphone? Do I have to own a smartphone to use ZØRE X?</b><br/>No. ZØRE X is a stand-alone storage lock.<br/>For those that would like, the smartphone app offers more options as an added value: For example, it enables ZØRE X to notify you when someone tampers with your gun.</p>
<p><b>Do I need to purchase a Bridge with the ZORE Watchdog?</b><br/>No. The ZØRE Bridge is an extension for the ZØRE X only. The ZØRE Watchdog has a built-in WiFI support and thus you'll always receive a tampering alert straight to your phone, even when you're outside of your home.</p>
<p><b>Can the ZØRE X cartridge device damage the barrel of my gun?</b><br/>No. The expansion of the cartridge only occurs at the moment that one attempts to charge the gun,<b> </b>and while the gun is in ‘rest mode’, there is absolutely no pressure being applied to the barrel. Any unauthorized attempt to rack the slide will not cause any damage to the barrel. This is because the locking unit is coated with polymers, thereby not allowing the barrel of the gun to be damaged in any way.</p>
<p><b>What if I charge my gun and ZØRE X is ejected from it, will the ZØRE X be damaged?</b><br/>ZØRE X is highly durable and was designed to absorb a 6 ft. fall of a fully loaded 1911 with the ZØRE X inside it.</p>
<p><b>Is the RAPIDIAL electronic?</b><br/>Yes. The RAPIDial is an electromechanical dial that was developed by ZØRE and meets the highest military standards.</p>
<p><b>What if someone removes the battery from my ZØRE?</b><br/>That is impossible - as long as your gun is locked, no one can remove the battery from your ZØRE. The battery is only accessible when ZØRE is open. Therefore, when your gun is locked, no one can take the battery out of your ZØRE.</p>
<p><b>How close to my ZØRE X should I plug the ZØRE BRIDGE?</b><br/>ZØRE products support BLE (up to 300 ft). We recommend to plug in the ZØRE BRIDGE in the same room as the stored gun with ZØRE X.</p>
<p><b>Does the ZØRE BRIDGE communicate with only one ZØRE X lock?</b><br/>No. One ZØRE BRIDGE can communicate with multiple locks when they are within its Bluetooth range so you can monitor all your guns through the app with one bridge.</p>
<p><b>Can I be tracked by my ZØRE?</b><br/>No. ZØRE does not have a GPS, therefore tracking it is impossible.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to hack my smartphone and lock my gun?</b><br/>No. The only way to lock your gun is mechanically - by physically pressing the lock button.<b> </b>Unlocking your gun using the dial overrides the communication with your phone, so you always control your gun when it is in your hands.</p>

Pip is naive and doesn’t know anything at all about this reality. Talking with a flower or a stone for him as natural as tasting another representative of local fauna. He examines this new world overcoming obstacles to a new rebirth and trying to figure out who he really is. At the same time he is learning the laws of karma and the relativity of good and evil.Platforms: Windows / Mac / LinuxNo text dialogue in the game. No text at all! All communication is via visual cues and images, in the form of clouds over the heads of the characters with cartoon icons only.Crazy psychedelic world surrounds the character throughout the game. Over 20 unique locations, lots of mini-games and original, surreal and mind-bending puzzles.Astral sight gives an opportunity to look into the world of spirits at any point in the game. It also allows you to see through different sets of eyes at the surrounding scenery. In the astral world you could find the hints for quests and many other exciting and amazing things. The most common object could look quite different in the astral world.Variability of completing quests gives different ways to play through the game again and again. You have a choice whether you’d like to do good or evil things to complete quests. Each evil deed spoils Pip’s karma and changes his appearance. He grows spikes and horns. Good deeds purified karma. Key characters respond differently to Pip’s karma, opening additional storyline.A lot of funny animations of the varied interactions of Pip.  The environment and other characters of the quests are drawn individually for each situation.                               Magic music  in ethnic-trance and psychedelic trance style accompanies your journey in each location and immerses you within the unique atmosphere of the unusual world of the game. All the music recorded live by band Zmeiraduga.                                                                                      The game was devised  in 2012 when our source of inspiration and Art Director Alexander Kuvshinov created a cartoon about the laws of Karma.At first it was intended as a small animated series which was just for fun. But when we saw how that turned out, we immediately decided to make a game of it, a real indie psychedelic adventure, that we all love to play! We got together and started developing the game in our spare time between major projects.Since that time enormous work on pre-production has been done; we’ve drawn a huge amount of concept art, designed and painted a bunch of brain puzzles, locations, made game design documentation and created the working prototype.Now we can safely say that the project will live! And we know how it will look. Our team has planned the distinct stages of its development. In order to fully concentrate on production and release truly amazing and unique game without censorship from publishers and non-core investors, we need your help.                                     We are a small indie team of true professionals in their areas: game production, producing, game design, design, animation. Each of us (except musicians) has a huge experience in the major game-development companies. Every specialist has several successful projects. We have established the team to release this project - a truly indie adventure which we have all dreamed of creating.Alexander KuvshinovIdea, design, animation, scenarioAndrey SharapovCEO, producing, marketingRoman PovolotskiyСo-producing, consultingYuriy KuptsevichProgrammingJohn KukaryambaZmeiraduga band, musicWe believe in principles of karma and would like to make the world a better place! We are confident that if we all do good deeds, then the world will respond to us in return. And also we believe that the saving of one tree purifies karma no worse than meditation and walking around the Kailash mountain=)We would like to give a piece of ownership of this belief to our players through our game. So our team decided that part of the revenue from sales of the game will be donated to the wildlife rescue fund WWF. By supporting our project you make a direct contribution to saving our planet.

We already assembling locations in the prototype now, which you can see it in the video. Approximately 20% of development is complete.Q: Will there be any form of DRM?We’re not totally certain, it will be on publisher’s side (Steam for example), so the answer is yes.Q: How will my pledge be distributed?Approximately:7% IndieGoGo & other fees10% development of the rewards for backers45% art & music development20% programming15% testing and debugging 3% software licenses, etc. Q: What drugs are you smoking, guys?!No one, only green tea =)Q: You have very small team, and it’s your first label together, how you can be sure you will create a great game?We will increase our team as necessary after we meet the goal. Of course it’s close to impossible to create awesome game without QA for example, or with only one animator.Secondly, we are all experienced professionals in game development, and in management of the process from beginning to the end of the process. Before we get together we’ve worked in big game studios in key positions and, of course, some of us already work together before Karma.Here are some examples of titles that members of our team helped creat:F2P Browser Based MMORTS “Rise Of Heroes” http://rohgame.com  Social F2P MMORPG ""The Heavens"" http://www.nebogame.comSocial F2P MMORPG ""GodSendGame"" http://www.dargame.comF2P Browser Based MMORPG ""Technomagic"" http://www.tmgame.ruF2P Browser Based MMORPG ""Territory"" http://www.territory.ruF2P Browser Based MMORPG ""Legend: Legacy of the Dragons"" http://www.dwar.ruChildren's game ""Doremi Frog""  http://doremifrog.ru/eng.html...and many others in fact (mobile, social, browser based), so we know what we do and what we are talking about =)Q: Your game is about karma and the relativity of good and evil; does that means that you believe you know what is good and what is bad and trying to impose your personal point of view to the player?No, we’re just telling a story of one incarnation of one strange creature in surreal world. Any coincidences is absolutely random =) And to be serious, of course not. It’s too complicated for someone to pretend to know what is good and what is evil, actually. We just created the game to give some fun to our players, that’s all we do. Everyone will find their own meaning in our game’s storyline.Q: Do you have clear scenario of the game?Of course we do =) Additional scenes and quests are still in progress, but it’s about we know what will happen within the scenes, but we don’t know how exactly yet. It doesn’t mean that the game will be released without any edits of current scenarios we have planned - we continually invent (and reinvent) new puzzles, quests and characters all the time, but we have a fixed base storyline.",96.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>Lasercut Braille Materials</h3>
<p>64 Oz. Games already offers a wide variety of braille materials and have be constantly increasing our line of products. We are already the world leader in providing ways for blind users to access the hobby board gaming market.</p>
<p>We feel that in order to reach the next level in our production we could use a lasercutter. Our business model relies on printing products on demand and having tools like these allow us to create the items after a customer has ordered them. Lasercutters are excellent at rapid prototyping and producing small runs of products both of which is essential for our business.</p>
<p>We've found what we believe to be an excellent deal on a lasercutter and we want to make it a reality. We are asking for small $5 donations to help fund our project. </p>
<p>Some ideas that we use the lasercutter for include...</p>
<ul>
<li>Create custom tactile replacement pieces for various board games. This will help distinguish pieces that are only different in color.</li>
<li>Create a lasercut version of some of our products such as our <a href=""http://www.64ouncegames.com/ShopCart/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=68&amp;products_id=248"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">braille puzzle blocks </a>to increase efficiency and reduce cost.</li>
<li>Create additional RPG materials such as lasercut structures for use with our tactile grids.</li>
<li>Increase detail on some of our thermoformed creations</li>
<li>Rapid prototyping of games using blind as a mechanic similar to our existing Yoink game. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>Our previous projects have used Kickstarter and not IndieGoGo. Changing platforms is an intentional choice on our part because this project is less about a particular end game product and more about giving us the capacity to make more very cool things. </p>
<p>By not providing the physical rewards that we've done in our previous Kickstarters we hope to be able to hit the ground running creating new prototype things right away. With both our previous Kickstarter campaigns it was almost a year before any of the products that we produced were in the store. This was because we had to fulfill the rewards for our backers before we could put up the new products. We hope to have things produced with the lasercutter available much sooner.</p>
<h3>What if we go over the goal?</h3>
<p>The community has been very supportive in the past and we have been fortunate in far exceeding our initial goals in both of our Kickstarter campaigns. While we don't expect this to be the case here for a couple reasons including the lack of physical rewards we could see it possibly happening. The goal that we set was to purchase the lasercutter but it is by no means the only cost that we will be facing with this project.</p>
<p>In order to safely house the lasercutter for instance we will have to replace our garage doors which leak terribly. We will need to put in new vents to the garage and a cooling system so that I can actually work out there in summer. We also will have to buy materials to cut and have a supply ready for when orders do come in.</p>
<p>If we far exceed the goal we would put it to other projects further down the line such as upgrading our embosser to improve the quality of braille produced or getting new tools to create tactile stickers in different ways. </p>
<h3>What if we don't reach the goal?</h3>
<p>We have some options for making this happen even if we get very little support but those options will limit our ability to do other projects concurrently. It isn't dire and you don't need to feel guilt to contribute. We're going to make this happen... but that doesn't mean we're not too proud to ask for help.</p>
<h3>Who is 64 Oz. Games?</h3>
<p>For the last 3 years 64 Oz. Games has introduced games to the blind community through two successful Kickstarter campaigns. It is run by Richard and Emily Gibbs. Richard is a board game lover and a life skills teacher. Emily is a Teacher of Blind Students and an expert in braille and accessibility.</p>
<p>Our <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64ouncegames/board-games-now-blind-accessible"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first campaign</a> focused on modern board games. We were able to create accessibility kits that allowed blind and sighted players to play board games together with over 14 different titles within the scope of the Kickstarter. This also allowed us to open our <a href=""http://store.64ouncegames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">store</a>. Since then we've expanded it to over 100 different games that were not previously available in Braille.</p>
<p>Our <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64ouncegames/braille-rpg-dice-from-64-oz-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">second campaign</a> focused on creating RPG dice. This project gave us access to a brand new 3d printer, a CNC mill for creating tactile grids and a thermoforming machine to allow us to make transparent overlays for board games.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<p>Using a lasercutter is something that we have some experience with from different hacker spaces. They are finky beasts though and often require a lot of maintenance. It is possible that we could get a lemon or it could require more work that we realize now. We could also discover this laser doesn't meet the demands that we are placing on it.</p>
<p>We've experienced this with our 3d printers and have done a lot of repairs on them during both of our Kickstarters.</p>
<p>We already have some experience working with lasercutters and have made some products with them in the past. We are familiar with the technology and it's pitfalls and if things go badly we know many experts on lasercutters as well that we can contact for advice and guidance such as our (kind of) local Houston hacker space, the good folks at Daft Creations or The Broken Token.</p>

<p>HEXES!! is a fast-paced party card game where you hex your friends with rules they must follow!  Your goal is to stay in the game while managing to follow the rules on all the hexes you happen to receive.  If you break one of these rules, you’re out!  On paper, it might sound pretty simple, but in practice, it can be incredibly difficult.  The hex rules combine with each other to create some absolutely hilarious moments.  Fun to play with friends and family!<br/><br/> </p>

<h1><strong>Emory University sits on the frontier of the social media revolution...</strong></h1>
<p><em>Most current Emory students have heard about ""The Emory Bubble,"" a term for the ""Bubble"" that the campus community creates for students. For some it represents the cocoon of safety that students seek being away from home. For others it's a term for the manner in which the community insulates itself from the surrounding community and larger world. For most it is the nature of a college community's unique culture. Each class has a syllabus; its the other stuff--extracurriculars, nightlife, campus happenings, the city--that needs a filter. Say hello to that filter. The Emory Bubble. </em></p>
<div>
<h1><strong>What it is:</strong></h1>
<p><strong>First, it is the gateway to events at Emory and in the community. </strong>No more wondering what’s happening on campus. All of the organizations you care about most will be here, and you’ll know what they’re doing. No more exhaustive detective work just to find out  AND have a way of interacting with them. </p>
<strong>Next, the Emory Bubble is the hub for all of the content published by the Emory community.</strong> All of the Media Council content is here, from the Spoke to WMRE to The Wheel. When you sign on, you too become a contributor to the Emory Bubble. </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Last, and perhaps most importantly, The Emory Bubble is a way to plug our community into itself.</strong> The institutional rate of change is far too slow. Our generation’s rate of change is exponential. This is a way for our institution to change at the same rate as we do. As a filter for only the best of the community, The Emory Bubble will follow the course you map for it. </p>
<h1><strong>What features are available? </strong></h1>
<div>
<p>1) <strong>Facebook integration</strong>. Users can sign in with their facebook account and get connected to the Emory community! This reduces the hassle of creating another account and adding friends and etc. Events on Facebook also sync on the Bubble, so no additional work is required of users when it comes to keeping it all coordinated! </p>
<p>2) <strong>Deals</strong>. We'll bring only the best vendors with the most compelling deals to students. Come on the site and see offerings from the places who have the most to offer.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Points and rewards</strong>. We are building a point and reward system for users where users will be awarded points by posting articles, videos and photos, creating and attending events, purchasing deals, which users can redeem for rewards like food and apparel at select vendors.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Mobile App</strong>. Our mobile app is will be a must-have this fall. It will keep users update with the latest happening on and off campus, wherever they are!</p>
<p>5) <strong>Events Calendar.</strong> This will be a simple yet powerful feature for students who want to know what’s going on without checking 3 different calendars. </p>
</div>
<h1><strong>Who does it benefit? </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Everyone! </strong>From small business owners, to student organizations, to students, it will help facilitate communication and interaction between different groups of people, ultimately enriching the bubble and linking the entire community on and off campus!</p>
<h1><strong>Where are we?</strong></h1>
<p>We have launched a beta site and engaged students of Emory to use it and provide feedback. To date, we have had 4,000 unique visitors, highly concentrated but not limited to the university’s student demographic and the local geographic area.

The 2 Ships featured in the game-play videos above are the heavy starfighter and the starfighter type Y.  As you can see in the prototype, these are 2 very different fighter craft and are for 2 different roles.      Each ship will take time to master and in multiplayer, skill and experience will be essential if you are to prevail on the battlefield. The game is based in the CDF (colonial defence force) universe which is a 90`s styled vision of the future with industrialized styled ships and technology.  Based 350 years in the future mankind has colonized many worlds and spread their influence in a small area of our galaxy.   The CDF was created to protect and serve mankind as we embarked on a new era of exploration.  The Human Civil war wiped out almost a third of the human race and half of the entire CDF Fleet.   During the Human Civil War the starfighter`s where formed.  An elite group of pilots who passed the vigorous starfighter selection process and ear the right to wear the starfighter Insignia.   The specially trained elite pilots helped turn the tide in the civil war and the Colonial Defence Force defeated the CLA (Colonial Liberation Army) at the battle of Sidook.   CDF Starfighter gives the player a chance to join the elite pilots of the CDF who are known as starfighters.  As mankind is about to face a new enemy, the starfighters will be needed to ensure the survival of the human race as a new and unknown alien threat emerges. A flight/space simulator and VR are the ideal mix!  But We don't stop there!  Every aspect of development is designed with VR in mind. With 2 years of VR development experience, we are packing a lot of cool features and the immersive experience into the game. The game in its alpha state is up to date with the current VR offering (DK2 from Oculus, we are currently on 0.8 sdk) and we will be aiming full VR compatibility with a variety of headset manufactures by the time of release. Multiplayer is a huge focus for us and we want it be fun and competitive. We have some great co-op, team and versus modes which will offer fun and teamwork in a balanced mix.  We have some great Multiplayer game modes lined up but none of that really means anything without you`re help!   We need you're support which will help to shape the multiplayer game into something amazing.  As a small Indie games developer, we want and need you to get involved the way you want.  We have rewards which offer the final polished game in all its glory for those who don't want to take part in testing.  We have rewards which offer early access and other perks who want to get more involved and help shape the multiplayer aspect of the game.  We have come a long way on zero funding, we now need to build on the potential of our game and push the quality level up and get some more talent on board.  We need help from you guys to make a truly awesome Space combat simulator.  We need to get some great voice actors, character artists, talented coders and much more to build on what we have.  We also need resources for marketing and polishing the game up to look and play much better than its current alpha state.   We have some great rewards on offer which give you more of the role you want to play.  If its early access or just the full final finished game, there are a lot of incentives on offer for everyone to help play a part in CDF Starfighter.  NAME YOUR OWN TRANSPORT IN THE GAME! We have a limited number of transports waiting to put your name on it!  As well as the name you can also decide on the color scheme.   NAME YOUR OWN SPACE STATION IN THE GAME!We have a limited number of space stations waiting to put your name on them! Our first Pledge for the Colonial Director reward will get their station named and ready in game within days of your pledge!  So to see this space station with your name on it, become a Colonial Director and we will work with you to get your station ready within days! Our game in its current state may look and play great but we still have a long way to go.  What we have achieved up to now is with zero funds! And if we can achieve this with no funding, then what could we achieve with some? Our key areas we need funding for are :
Character Artist/Animation and Lip sync for briefings etc.
Professional Voice Actors
Particle Effects
Sound FX
Marketing
£25,000 may not seem like a lot compared to other games but for CDF Starfighter it will make a huge difference.  We have some great rewards up for grabs and with popular Demand we may add some more.(Reward breakdown which is based in the GBP - UK Sterling) Our first funding goal is £25,000 and will enable us to bring you a fully polished single player experience and start the ball rolling with multiplayer which will be worked on with the community over 6 months.  We have some great plans for CDF Starfighter and we really do hope that we can unleash more potential of the game by reaching some of our stretch goals with some help from you guys.  If we raise above and beyond our funding goal then we can expand on what we have and offer many more features.  We can raise the quality bar overall by the time of release and we will have the single player finished as a complete package in march.  CDF Starfighter is designed for controller support, VR and head tracking.  We are developing the game with cross platform support in mind.STRETCH GOAL 1 :£50,000 +If we can double our primary funding goal then we can have a lot more resources at our disposal to bolster the games quality in crucial areas such as motion capture for characters and much better overall voice actors.  We will have more resources to invest in the overall release quality of the game as whole.STRETCH GOAL 2 :£100,000 + With our second stretch goal we  will be putting a lot more resources into multiplayer and be able to hire the necessary talent to ensure that CDF Starfighter is one of the best multiplayer and co-op space combats sims out there.  We will be able to carry forward the multiplayer side of the game and add extra ships, turrets and invest in a new community Co-Op game mode which will be voted and decided by you, the community in March 2016.  We will take the best ideas and input from all you budding pilots and work with you to create an Epic multiplayer mode.STRETCH GOAL 3 :£350,000 +We have an awesome game which we really want to expand to include a mission editor/level editor.  As a small indie company this is currently beyond our financial and required workflow scope, as building the necessary simple user tool-set to make this reality would require a perm-ant team and more time.  We really want to go beyond that and make the game modifiable within a year of first release but again, this requires a large team to be able to launch and support the modding community.  There are many more limits which can be lifted,  If we get more than Stretch Goal 3 then we have a new mandate from you and the community we build together to take a little more time and turn CDF Starfighter in the greatest space combat simulator of all time.With all our stretch goals, we will give updates and more information about these when we get close to each tier.",34.0,5,"2 Campaigns

winter, a group of philantropist and humanists - 
composed of artists, philosophers, scientists, politicians... -  save 
in particular crystals allowing to stock sensible 
informations, their memories, ideas, dreams, their plans of objects and 
workpieces. <br/>Pretty much everything that could represent the memory of 
humanity, preparing themselves to see their species being eradicated.</p>
<p>Soon, the planet is again silent.</p>
<p>The Kaodian crystals containing the fragments of past life are patiently waiting in their shelters, 
slowly evolving with time, submitted to Time and the high radioactivity 
of the planet.<br/><br/></p>
<p>At first, these ideas adjust and take an “organic” shape.<br/>
Finally, they end up freeing themselves from their envelops – a cocoon with which 
they today still have a strong bound – then from their shelters, to 
now represent the new fauna of the Known World.</p>
<p>Born of ideas contained in crystals to their current form, we call them : the ""Kaodes"".</p><br/><p>""<b>And what about the player in all this ?""<br/><br/></b>Good question fellow player/contributor/artist eager to join us !<br/><br/></p><p>After the downfall and the re-emergence of men on Earth, it was 
decided that each man and woman would undertake a journey of at least 
one year long.<br/>
A journey across forests, cities and swamps all around the world ; they 
would learn about the value of life, about helping one another, about 
the value of adventure and the importance of knowledge : all hoping that
 mistakes made in the past - mostly those which lead to the Great War – 
would never happen again.</p><b>
</b><p>You will embody this traveler, accompagnied by a Kaode that is bound 
to you since your childhood, in order for you to stumble upon the 
mysteries and legends of the new world, while cooperating with other 
travelers, challenging some of them. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/609915/files/20140528114319-kaode-gif-beta.v2.gif?1401302599"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571653/files/20140511081743-1-qu-est-ce-que-kaode.en.png?1399821463"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Kaode is an independent game, offering an individual and personalised gaming experience : its concept goes back over a time where the graphism were not the only key to its success.</p><br/><p>The system is built in order for you to be at the center of an adventure of which YOU are the hero, in a progressive world :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Challenge your friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live an original adventure, plot and set in a new world where humanity emerges from the ruins of a medieval, steampunk and contemporary world.</p>

<p>Aware of our capacities and of our limits, our goal is to tell a story with humour, about important themes, and to introduce a certain depth in the places and caracters that will come across, the quests, the enigmas and the functioning of the game.<br/>
It is essential for us to create elaborated atmospheres, all gathered around adventures and battles between friends.</p>
<p>This is why the first interest is the discovery of a coherent and referenced universe.</p>
<p>In order to personalise each and everyone's adventure, and force the community to undertake researchs on our universe, each place will offer numerous quests and surprises of which the probability to come across them will vary from one player to the other.<br/>
Doing this way, two peope will be able to move in the same places, but face very different situations, access to various places, posess Kaode that do not look the same. This way, the adventure becomes personal, at the opposite of many MMORPG claiming to be epic, but where the player is very often an anonymous somebody.</p>
<p>The second appeal of the game - and the second way to play the adventure - is to consider Kaode as a monster battling game.<br/>
We are both collectors, and we are familiar with the pleasure to go and look for creatures and objects, the importance of the elements that personalise the player's experience and avatar.<br/></p><br/><br/><p>Here a ""style"" preview of the map, it's the one we used for the Alpha version, and it's from Laura Eva Zimmer ;)</p>

<p>About the community aspect : the game is based on three particular systems, including two innovative ones.</p>
<p>1 - The <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Events</span> are key moments in the game where new elements are being introduced, and that are likely to transfom the Map - to the point of destroying towns and forests, change river's course, extinct species – and the game. The players who will feel concerned with their universe will participate or oppose to these “moments”.</p>
<p>Our current ambition is to be able to set up these moments as often as possible, this way confronting as many players as possible to moral choices that will lead the game towards any new mecanics it will bread.</p>
<p>2 - Finaly, Kaode will be progressive thanks to your particpation. <br/>For now, the map will be entirely revealed to all. Some areas will be however limited by certain handicaps, and others accessible with the necessary acquisition of Unlock Achievement, and others possible to unlock by the community thanks to the players' ingenuity.</p>
<p>Some cities of the world will offer real democratical campaign of construction of buildings, and players will be able to vote for the choice of the first structure and for its functions.</p>
<p>Will the players' population vote for a train station, a guild hall or an arena for the capital ?</p>

It is a bit like that : pulling strings, constraints and deals against a concept that fits with the Kaode spirit : mutual aid, freedom and human adventure.</p>
<p>In this case, why not ask our players for some help... ask your help : dreamers to dreamers, we should get along... right ?<br/><br/></p>

<p>Coming back on the crowdfunding, we have decided to adopt a tiered approch, with first what is absolutely necessary for us.</p>
<p>The successive levels allow us to truely climb one step of the ladder, by allowing us a mass communication, the production of super fun goodies and giving us the opportunity to go further in the set up and the development of the game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">Here are the levels in detail :</p><br/><p><b>Level 1 – Design and first expense :</b> 1550 euros<br/><br/></p>
<p>With this amount, we would be able to hire a designer in order to finish the Map of Kaode, offer animations and mini-maps for the 50 to 70 places that are planned.</p>
<p>In other words : transforming a paper role-playing game into a video game.</p>
<p>We would also be able to repay our application fees, the server space, etc...</p><br/><p><b>Level 2 : Communication and goodies :</b> (+750) 2300 euros</p>
<p>Kaode inside, Kaode outside, Kaode everywhere !<br/><br/></p>
<p>A good communication (games room, T-shirts, posters, flyers, cardboards, mugs - having a press agent...) would mean more players.</p>
<p>It may seem quite simple and corny, but in the end, this would mean : a more interesting world, more exchanges and investment coming from the gamers community, and thus more movement and evolutions in the game.<br/><br/>
If Kaode is indeed working after a few months, we would be able to further its development at the same rhythm, and to continue to create new places and events, add new functions, create always more and more !<br/><br/></p>

<br/><p>If the level 1 validates the game's release, the level 2 will secure a proper launch ; this way allowing us a certain amount of players as soon as the beta game is realeased.</p><br/><p><b>Level 3 – Kaode IRL :</b> (+850) 3150 euros</p>
<p>Between us gamers, no lies be told, and this especially since the 90s : having a physical representation of our creatures, our comics' characters, cartoons and video game is pretty awesome.<br/><br/></p>
<p>With the (relative) boom of the 3D impression, our research brought us to rub shoulders with modelers and other 3D enthusiasts.</p><br/><p>Slowly catching the idea in our own range, we have been working on a few patterns, and we are just starting to have a few versions of Kaodes in 3D.</p>

nucléaire, du ""grand cataclysme"" : un groupe d'humaniste composé de 
philanthropes réunissant artistes, philosophes, scientifiques, 
politiciens etc... enregistrent dans des cristaux permettant le stockage
 d'informations sensibles, leurs souvenirs, idées, leurs rêves, des 
plans d'objets ou des œuvres. En somme, tout ce qui pourrait constituer 
une mémoire de l'humanité, se préparant à l’éradication de l’espèce.<br/></p><p>Les craintes de ces individus se confirment, et la planète est une nouvelle fois silencieuse.</p>
<p><br/>
Les cristaux Kaodiens renfermant les parcelles de vie des individus du 
projet Oneiros attendent patiemment dans leurs abris, évoluant doucement
 avec le temps, soumis à la forte radioactivité de la planète. Dans un 
premier temps, les idées se réajustent et prennent une forme ""organique"". <br/>Finissant par s'émanciper des cristaux - une enveloppe 
avec laquelle ils conservent aujourd'hui un lien fort - puis des abris 
pour aujourd'hui représenter la nouvelle faune du monde connu.<br/><br/>
D'idées humaines contenues dans des cristaux à la forme que l'on leur connaît aujourd'hui, on les appelle : les « Kaodes ».<br/><br/><b>- « Et le joueur dans tout ça ? »</b><br/><br/>
Décidément, tu poses de bonnes questions joueur/contributeur/artiste désirant nous rejoindre !<br/><br/>
Après la chute et la mystérieuse ré-émergence de l'homme sur la Terre, 
il a été décidé que chaque homme et femme entreprendrait dans sa vie un 
voyage d'une durée minimum d'une année.</p>
<p>Parcourant les forets, les villes et les marais du monde, ils et 
elles apprendraient la valeur de la vie, de l'entraide, de l'aventure et
 l'importance du savoir ; dans l'espoir que les erreurs du passé - et 
surtout celles ayant conduites à la Grande guerre - ne soient jamais 
reproduites.</p><br/><p>Vous incarnez ce voyageur, accompagné d'un Kaode qui vous est lié 
depuis l'enfance, afin de vous confronter aux mystères et légendes du Nouveau Monde, coopérant avec d'autres voyageurs, en affrontant 
certains.<br/></p>

Le système est conçu pour que vous soyez au centre d'une aventure dont VOUS êtes le héros, au sein d'un monde évolutif :<br/></p>

<li>
<p>Affrontez vos amis</p>
</li>
<li>

Il est primordial pour nous de créer des atmosphères travaillées, le tout autour d'aventures et de batailles entre amis.</p><p>L'intérêt primaire est donc celui de la découverte d'un univers cohérent et référencé, où le fond compense la forme.</p>
<p>Pour personnaliser l'aventure de chacun et forcer la communauté à entreprendre des recherches dans notre univers, chaque lieu sera pourvu de nombreuses quêtes et surprises dont la probabilité de rencontre sera variable. Ainsi, deux personnes pourront se déplacer dans les mêmes endroits, mais rencontrer des situations très différentes, accéder à des lieux divers, posséder des Kaodes qui ne se ressemblent pas (à l'inverse de nombreux MMORPG se voulant épiques, où le joueur n'est bien souvent qu'un personnage lambda).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Le second attrait du jeu - et la deuxième façon d'aborder l'aventure - est de prendre Kaode comme un jeu d'affrontement de monstres. Nous sommes deux collectionneurs, et nous connaissons le plaisir de partir à la recherche de créatures et d'objets, l'importance d'avoir des éléments qui personnalisent l'expérience et le héros du joueur.</p>
<br/><p>Ici une petite preview de la map du monde utilisé pour la version alpha (vous ne la retrouverez pas dans le jeu mais le style y est !)<br/>
Oh et c'est de Laura Eva Zimmer =) !</p>

Pour rester sur l'aspect communautaire : le jeu repose sur 3 systèmes particuliers, dont deux novateurs.<br/><br/>
Nous venons de citer le Pvp (Player Versus Player) sur lequel nous reviendrons plus tard, parlons un peu du reste :<br/><br/>
1 - Les <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Événements</span> sont des moments particuliers du jeu où de nouveaux éléments sont introduits, et qui sont susceptibles de transformer la Map - quitte à détruire ville et forêt, changer le cours des rivières, éteindre des espèces... - et le jeu. Les joueurs qui se sentiront concernés par leur univers participeront ou s'opposeront à ces « moments ».

<p>Il est vraiment important pour nous de rythmer le jeu et de créer une véritable ambiance de roleplay.<br/><br/>
Aussi, notre ambition à l'heure actuelle est de pouvoir implanter ces événements le plus souvent possible, confrontant le plus de joueurs possible à des choix moraux qui orienteront le jeu vers telle ou telle nouvelle mécanique à son issue.<br/><br/>
2 - Enfin, Kaode sera évolutif, grâce à votre participation.<br/>
Dans l'immédiat, la map sera révélée dans son intégralité, et à tous. Certaines aires seront limitées par certains handicaps, d'autres accessibles selon la nécessaire obtention d'Unlock Achievements, d'autres déblocables par la communauté grâce à l'ingéniosité des joueurs.</p>
<p>Certaines villes du monde proposeront aussi de véritables campagnes démocratiques de construction de bâtiments et les joueurs pourront voter le choix de la prochaine bâtisse ainsi que ses fonctionnalités.<br/>
La population de joueur choisira t-elle une gare, un hall des guildes ou une arène pour la capitale ?<br/></p>
<p><br/>

Ah, oui, je ne vous ai pas raconté le meilleur : pour représenter la subjectivité des informations contenus dans les cristaux, enregistrées par les membres du projet Oneiros, les Kaodes sont dessinés par des illustrateurs différents, proposants une variété de style, de concepts, de colorisations compatibles avec l'esprit et le background du jeu.<br/><p><br/><br/>

Pour les joueurs moins portés vers la narration, les collectionneurs, et soyons honnêtes tous les joueurs qui aiment la stratégie et taper sur des monstres de temps en temps, un tonnerre d'applaudissement, voici le système de combat de Kaodes :<br/><br/>
Non je plaisante, ce serait trop long. On va faire ça différemment.<br/><br/>
Pour tout ce qui est définition du système d'évolution, les statistiques et l'apprentissage de techniques, je vais plutôt vous renvoyer vers ce lien sur la page (datée) d'appel à participation réalisée en janvier, qui définit les bases de notre travail sur le système d'affrontement.<br/><br/><a href=""http://weneedyou.fabienplart.fr/download/preview-combat.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Système de combat (PDF FR)</a><br/><br/>
Une dernière spécificité relative à Kaode : il sera possible et parfois nécessaire pour le personnage de prendre personnellement part au combat. En effet, si les tournois et les matchs amateurs mettront principalement en scène des Kaodes, lorsque le joueur devra se défendre contre des brigands, zombies ou autres menaces Kaodiennes et que personne ne sera plus en mesure de le protéger : il sera temps de se défendre !<br/></p>

C'est un peu : pistons, contraintes et marché contre un concept qui colle à l'esprit de Kaode : entraide, liberté et aventure humaine.<br/><br/>
Dans ce cas, pourquoi ne pas demander un peu d'aide à nos joueurs...à vous ; que les rêveurs aident les rêveurs... non ?<br/><br/><br/>
Pour vous prouver que nous avons quand même la tête sur les épaules, voici une estimation de notre budget et une étude de marché réalisée par notre responsable marketing et conseiller financier :<br/><br/><a href=""http://weneedyou.fabienplart.fr/download/etude-de-marche.light.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Etude de marché light (PDF FR)</a><br/><br/><br/>
Pour revenir au financement participatif, nous avons décidé une approche par paliers, avec dans un premier temps ce qui nous est absolument nécessaire.</p>
<p>Les échelons successifs nous permettraient de véritablement passer un cap, en nous autorisant une communication de masse, une production de goodies super funs et nous laissant la possibilité d'aller plus loin dans la mise en place et l'élaboration du jeu.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Voici les paliers en détails :</span></b><br/><br/><b>Palier 1 - Graphisme et premiers frais</b> : 1550 euros<br/><br/>
Avec cet argent, nous pourrions engager une graphiste pour finir la carte du monde de Kaode, proposer des animations et des mini-maps pour les 50 à 70 lieux prévus.</p>
<p>En somme : transformer un jeu de rôle papier en jeu-vidéo.<br/><br/>
Nous pourrions aussi rembourser nos frais de dossiers, payer l'hébergement du serveur etc...<br/><br/><br/><b>Palier 2 - Communication et goodies:</b> (+750) 2300 euros<br/><br/>
Kaode chez toi, Kaode dans la rue, Kaode partout !<br/><br/>
Une bonne communication (avoir un attaché de presse, faire les salons du jeu, produire : T-shirts, affiches, flyers, panneaux cartonnées, mugs...) voudrait dire plus de joueurs.</p>
<p>Ça paraît peut-être simple et bateau, mais dans les faits : cela voudrait dire un monde plus intéressant, plus d'échanges et d'investissement de la part de la communauté des joueurs, et donc plus de mouvement et d'évolutions dans le jeu : si Kaode fonctionne même au bout de quelques mois, nous pourrions continuer à développer au même rythme, continuer d'écrire lieux et événements, ajouter de nouvelles fonctionnalités, créer encore et toujours !<br/></p>

Si le palier 1 validerait la sortie du jeu ; la palier 2 assurerait un lancement en bonne et due forme ; nous permettant d'avoir une certaine quantité de joueur dès la sortie de la beta.<br/><br/><br/><b>Palier 3 – Kaode IRL (dans la vraie vie)</b> – (+850) 3150 euros<br/><br/>
Entre joueurs, on ne va pas se mentir, et surtout depuis les 90's : avoir une représentation physique de nos créatures, ou personnages de comics, cartoon et jeux vidéo, c'est vraiment cool.<br/><br/>
Avec l'essor (relatif) de l'impression 3D, nos recherches nous ont poussé à côtoyer des modélisateurs et autres passionnés du milieu de la 3D.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p>Effleurant l'idée d'avoir notre propre gamme, nous avons travaillé quelques patrons, et l'on commence à avoir certaines versions de Kaodes en 3D.<br/><br/></p>

Pour l'instant, seules quelques entreprises ou laboratoires permettent l'impression d'objets en plastique comme celui-ci à grande échelle. Il suffirait cependant d'un petit modèle d'imprimante pour nous permettre une certaine quantité de production.<br/><br/>
C'est pourquoi, si vous nous aidez à obtenir une imprimante, nous pourrions créer une large gamme de figurines en 3 dimensions, à faible coût, et donc : à petit prix pour vous !<br/><br/><br/><b>Palier 4 – Aller plus loin...et enveloppe collaborateurs !</b> ( 3150+)<br/><br/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/561634/files/20140506143919-6-team.png?1399412359"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Nous sommes actuellement 14 membres officiels sur le projet, sans compter les innombrables conseils et rencontres qui font de ce projet une si jolie expérience.</p><br/><p>Voici en quelques mots :</p><br/><table><tbody>

They talk about us in the newspaper !






Version française ICI !--1. What is Kaode ?2. Why play Kaode ?3. Special features4. Artworks5. Why a crowdfunding ?6. Team 7. Conterparts in english (PDF)
The third World War occurred... And at the beginning of the nuclear 
winter, a group of philantropist and humanists - 
composed of artists, philosophers, scientists, politicians... -  save 
in particular crystals allowing to stock sensible 
informations, their memories, ideas, dreams, their plans of objects and 
workpieces. Pretty much everything that could represent the memory of 
humanity, preparing themselves to see their species being eradicated.
Soon, the planet is again silent.
The Kaodian crystals containing the fragments of past life are patiently waiting in their shelters, 
slowly evolving with time, submitted to Time and the high radioactivity 
of the planet.
At first, these ideas adjust and take an “organic” shape.
Finally, they end up freeing themselves from their envelops – a cocoon with which 
they today still have a strong bound – then from their shelters, to 
now represent the new fauna of the Known World.
Born of ideas contained in crystals to their current form, we call them : the ""Kaodes"".""And what about the player in all this ?""Good question fellow player/contributor/artist eager to join us !After the downfall and the re-emergence of men on Earth, it was 
decided that each man and woman would undertake a journey of at least 
one year long.
A journey across forests, cities and swamps all around the world ; they 
would learn about the value of life, about helping one another, about 
the value of adventure and the importance of knowledge : all hoping that
 mistakes made in the past - mostly those which lead to the Great War – 
would never happen again.
You will embody this traveler, accompagnied by a Kaode that is bound 
to you since your childhood, in order for you to stumble upon the 
mysteries and legends of the new world, while cooperating with other 
travelers, challenging some of them. Kaode is an independent game, offering an individual and personalised gaming experience : its concept goes back over a time where the graphism were not the only key to its success.The system is built in order for you to be at the center of an adventure of which YOU are the hero, in a progressive world :


Challenge your friends


Live an original adventure, plot and set in a new world where humanity emerges from the ruins of a medieval, steampunk and contemporary world.


Choose your own approach of the game : exploration, collaboration or collection ?


You understood that Kaode is mainly an adventure and exploration game.
Aware of our capacities and of our limits, our goal is to tell a story with humour, about important themes, and to introduce a certain depth in the places and caracters that will come across, the quests, the enigmas and the functioning of the game.
It is essential for us to create elaborated atmospheres, all gathered around adventures and battles between friends.
This is why the first interest is the discovery of a coherent and referenced universe.
In order to personalise each and everyone's adventure, and force the community to undertake researchs on our universe, each place will offer numerous quests and surprises of which the probability to come across them will vary from one player to the other.
Doing this way, two peope will be able to move in the same places, but face very different situations, access to various places, posess Kaode that do not look the same. This way, the adventure becomes personal, at the opposite of many MMORPG claiming to be epic, but where the player is very often an anonymous somebody.
The second appeal of the game - and the second way to play the adventure - is to consider Kaode as a monster battling game.
We are both collectors, and we are familiar with the pleasure to go and look for creatures and objects, the importance of the elements that personalise the player's experience and avatar.Here a ""style"" preview of the map, it's the one we used for the Alpha version, and it's from Laura Eva Zimmer ;)



About the community aspect : the game is based on three particular systems, including two innovative ones.
1 - The Events are key moments in the game where new elements are being introduced, and that are likely to transfom the Map - to the point of destroying towns and forests, change river's course, extinct species – and the game. The players who will feel concerned with their universe will participate or oppose to these “moments”.
Our current ambition is to be able to set up these moments as often as possible, this way confronting as many players as possible to moral choices that will lead the game towards any new mecanics it will bread.
2 - Finaly, Kaode will be progressive thanks to your particpation. For now, the map will be entirely revealed to all. Some areas will be however limited by certain handicaps, and others accessible with the necessary acquisition of Unlock Achievement, and others possible to unlock by the community thanks to the players' ingenuity.
Some cities of the world will offer real democratical campaign of construction of buildings, and players will be able to vote for the choice of the first structure and for its functions.
Will the players' population vote for a train station, a guild hall or an arena for the capital ?

But enough chit-chat, like they say, a video is worth a long speech, forewarned is forearmed and a rolling stone gathers no moss.
[The English subtitles have to be activated form youtube. You know, the little card between the timer and the gear.]
Oh yeah, I save the best for last : in order to represent the subjectivity of the informations contained in the crystals and saved by the members of the Oneiros project, the Kaodes were drawn by different illustrators, thus offering a great diversity of styles, concepts and colourisations compatible with the general spirit and the background of the game.
Here are a few artworks from our illustrators.

               ""What about the battle ?!""For the players that are less inclined to narration, collectors, and let's be honest, all the players that love strategy and slay a few monsters from time to time, *drum roll*, here is the combat system of Kaodes :Na just kidding it would take too long. Let's do this another way.
For all that include definitions of the evolution system, statistics and techniques/skills learning, I will rather send you back to this PdF made in january (on our first call for participations), which defines the bases of our work on the battle system.Fight system (PDF EN)One last specificity concerning the Kaodes : it will be possible, and sometime necessary for the character to personaly intervene in the combat.
Indeed, although the tournaments and the amateur matches will mostly stage Kaodes, whenever the player will have to defend himself against bandits, zombies and other Kaodian threats, and that he has no one to protect him : it will be time for him to defend himself.HERE, a preview gif of the combat !Because from the start, we have been working with the team of free volunteers on a collaborative game, and we wish to keep a free spirit in its conception and its scenario.In France, whenever you do not belong to a big structure, the only way to be financed is through the regional financial support (granted once a year) or through the help of the CNC (Centre National du Cinéma et de l'image animée, a National Centre of the Cinema and Moving Pictures), including three sessions a year, a jury of 13 people belonging to the gaming world.
It is a bit like that : pulling strings, constraints and deals against a concept that fits with the Kaode spirit : mutual aid, freedom and human adventure.
In this case, why not ask our players for some help... ask your help : dreamers to dreamers, we should get along... right ?
To prove to you that we do are hard-headed, here is an estimation of our budget and a market study (in french - sorry !) realised by our marketing manager and financial advisor :Etude de marché light (PDF FR) 


Coming back on the crowdfunding, we have decided to adopt a tiered approch, with first what is absolutely necessary for us.
The successive levels allow us to truely climb one step of the ladder, by allowing us a mass communication, the production of super fun goodies and giving us the opportunity to go further in the set up and the development of the game.

Here are the levels in detail :Level 1 – Design and first expense : 1550 euros
With this amount, we would be able to hire a designer in order to finish the Map of Kaode, offer animations and mini-maps for the 50 to 70 places that are planned.
In other words : transforming a paper role-playing game into a video game.
We would also be able to repay our application fees, the server space, etc...Level 2 : Communication and goodies : (+750) 2300 euros
Kaode inside, Kaode outside, Kaode everywhere !
A good communication (games room, T-shirts, posters, flyers, cardboards, mugs - having a press agent...) would mean more players.
It may seem quite simple and corny, but in the end, this would mean : a more interesting world, more exchanges and investment coming from the gamers community, and thus more movement and evolutions in the game.
If Kaode is indeed working after a few months, we would be able to further its development at the same rhythm, and to continue to create new places and events, add new functions, create always more and more !


If the level 1 validates the game's release, the level 2 will secure a proper launch ; this way allowing us a certain amount of players as soon as the beta game is realeased.Level 3 – Kaode IRL : (+850) 3150 euros
Between us gamers, no lies be told, and this especially since the 90s : having a physical representation of our creatures, our comics' characters, cartoons and video game is pretty awesome.
With the (relative) boom of the 3D impression, our research brought us to rub shoulders with modelers and other 3D enthusiasts.Slowly catching the idea in our own range, we have been working on a few patterns, and we are just starting to have a few versions of Kaodes in 3D.
Here is a test impression, a basic exemple of one of the creatures of the game, a “phobia of knives”, drawn by Arthur Besson : “Chickenife” !     Jookoki, by Roman !                  !!!Arachniege, by Sylvain Guidotti     Upcoming : Slim !                                                                           
For now, only a few companies or labs allow the impression of plastic objects like the one in large scale. We would howerver only need a small printer model to allow us a certain quantity of production.
This is why if you help us obtain a printer, we will be able to create a wide 3D figurines range at low cost, and thus, low cost for you too !Level 4 - Expansion !

1. Qu'est-ce que Kaode ?2. Pourquoi jouer à Kaode ?3. Spécificités4. Artworks5. Pourquoi le financement participatif ?6. Team7. Contreparties traduites en français (PDF)
La troisième guerre mondiale a eu lieu... et à l'aube de l'hiver 
nucléaire, du ""grand cataclysme"" : un groupe d'humaniste composé de 
philanthropes réunissant artistes, philosophes, scientifiques, 
politiciens etc... enregistrent dans des cristaux permettant le stockage
 d'informations sensibles, leurs souvenirs, idées, leurs rêves, des 
plans d'objets ou des œuvres. En somme, tout ce qui pourrait constituer 
une mémoire de l'humanité, se préparant à l’éradication de l’espèce.Les craintes de ces individus se confirment, et la planète est une nouvelle fois silencieuse.

Les cristaux Kaodiens renfermant les parcelles de vie des individus du 
projet Oneiros attendent patiemment dans leurs abris, évoluant doucement
 avec le temps, soumis à la forte radioactivité de la planète. Dans un 
premier temps, les idées se réajustent et prennent une forme ""organique"". Finissant par s'émanciper des cristaux - une enveloppe 
avec laquelle ils conservent aujourd'hui un lien fort - puis des abris 
pour aujourd'hui représenter la nouvelle faune du monde connu.
D'idées humaines contenues dans des cristaux à la forme que l'on leur connaît aujourd'hui, on les appelle : les « Kaodes ».- « Et le joueur dans tout ça ? »
Décidément, tu poses de bonnes questions joueur/contributeur/artiste désirant nous rejoindre !
Après la chute et la mystérieuse ré-émergence de l'homme sur la Terre, 
il a été décidé que chaque homme et femme entreprendrait dans sa vie un 
voyage d'une durée minimum d'une année.
Parcourant les forets, les villes et les marais du monde, ils et 
elles apprendraient la valeur de la vie, de l'entraide, de l'aventure et
 l'importance du savoir ; dans l'espoir que les erreurs du passé - et 
surtout celles ayant conduites à la Grande guerre - ne soient jamais 
reproduites.Vous incarnez ce voyageur, accompagné d'un Kaode qui vous est lié 
depuis l'enfance, afin de vous confronter aux mystères et légendes du Nouveau Monde, coopérant avec d'autres voyageurs, en affrontant 
certains.

Kaode est un jeu indépendant proposant une expérience de jeu individuelle et personnalisée, et un type de multijoueur participatif ; son concept reprend les éléments de jeux d'un temps où le graphisme n'avait pas forcément une place centrale dans son succès.Pour résumer :Kaode est un jeu d'aventure, d'exploration et de collection/combat de créatures communautaire sur PC et mobile, prenant place dans un univers post-apocalyptique.
Le système est conçu pour que vous soyez au centre d'une aventure dont VOUS êtes le héros, au sein d'un monde évolutif :


Affrontez vos amis


Vivez une aventure originale, scénarisée et prenant part dans un monde nouveau, où l'humanité refait surface dans les décombres d'un monde médiéval, steampunk et contemporain.


Choisissez votre approche du jeu: exploration, collaboration ou collection ?


Kaode est avant tout un jeu d'aventure et d'exploration. Le gameplay se veut simple - et mobile friendly – à l'image du design. Notre objectif est de raconter une histoire avec humour sur des thèmes importants, d'introduire une certaine profondeur dans les lieux et personnages rencontrés, les quêtes, les énigmes et le fonctionnement. Il est primordial pour nous de créer des atmosphères travaillées, le tout autour d'aventures et de batailles entre amis.L'intérêt primaire est donc celui de la découverte d'un univers cohérent et référencé, où le fond compense la forme.
Pour personnaliser l'aventure de chacun et forcer la communauté à entreprendre des recherches dans notre univers, chaque lieu sera pourvu de nombreuses quêtes et surprises dont la probabilité de rencontre sera variable. Ainsi, deux personnes pourront se déplacer dans les mêmes endroits, mais rencontrer des situations très différentes, accéder à des lieux divers, posséder des Kaodes qui ne se ressemblent pas (à l'inverse de nombreux MMORPG se voulant épiques, où le joueur n'est bien souvent qu'un personnage lambda).

Le second attrait du jeu - et la deuxième façon d'aborder l'aventure - est de prendre Kaode comme un jeu d'affrontement de monstres. Nous sommes deux collectionneurs, et nous connaissons le plaisir de partir à la recherche de créatures et d'objets, l'importance d'avoir des éléments qui personnalisent l'expérience et le héros du joueur.
Ici une petite preview de la map du monde utilisé pour la version alpha (vous ne la retrouverez pas dans le jeu mais le style y est !)
Oh et c'est de Laura Eva Zimmer =) !


Pour rester sur l'aspect communautaire : le jeu repose sur 3 systèmes particuliers, dont deux novateurs.
Nous venons de citer le Pvp (Player Versus Player) sur lequel nous reviendrons plus tard, parlons un peu du reste :
1 - Les Événements sont des moments particuliers du jeu où de nouveaux éléments sont introduits, et qui sont susceptibles de transformer la Map - quitte à détruire ville et forêt, changer le cours des rivières, éteindre des espèces... - et le jeu. Les joueurs qui se sentiront concernés par leur univers participeront ou s'opposeront à ces « moments ».

Il est vraiment important pour nous de rythmer le jeu et de créer une véritable ambiance de roleplay.
Aussi, notre ambition à l'heure actuelle est de pouvoir implanter ces événements le plus souvent possible, confrontant le plus de joueurs possible à des choix moraux qui orienteront le jeu vers telle ou telle nouvelle mécanique à son issue.
2 - Enfin, Kaode sera évolutif, grâce à votre participation.
Dans l'immédiat, la map sera révélée dans son intégralité, et à tous. Certaines aires seront limitées par certains handicaps, d'autres accessibles selon la nécessaire obtention d'Unlock Achievements, d'autres déblocables par la communauté grâce à l'ingéniosité des joueurs.
Certaines villes du monde proposeront aussi de véritables campagnes démocratiques de construction de bâtiments et les joueurs pourront voter le choix de la prochaine bâtisse ainsi que ses fonctionnalités.
La population de joueur choisira t-elle une gare, un hall des guildes ou une arène pour la capitale ?

Mais trêve de fariboles, comme dit l'adage, une vidéo vaut mieux qu'un long discours, un homme avertit en vaut deux et pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse.
Ah, oui, je ne vous ai pas raconté le meilleur : pour représenter la subjectivité des informations contenus dans les cristaux, enregistrées par les membres du projet Oneiros, les Kaodes sont dessinés par des illustrateurs différents, proposants une variété de style, de concepts, de colorisations compatibles avec l'esprit et le background du jeu.
Voici quelques artworks de nos illustrateurs.[Vous voulez participer au projet ?  Rejoignez nous ! kaode@outlook.com]               « Et le combat dans tout ça ? »
Pour les joueurs moins portés vers la narration, les collectionneurs, et soyons honnêtes tous les joueurs qui aiment la stratégie et taper sur des monstres de temps en temps, un tonnerre d'applaudissement, voici le système de combat de Kaodes :
Non je plaisante, ce serait trop long. On va faire ça différemment.
Pour tout ce qui est définition du système d'évolution, les statistiques et l'apprentissage de techniques, je vais plutôt vous renvoyer vers ce lien sur la page (datée) d'appel à participation réalisée en janvier, qui définit les bases de notre travail sur le système d'affrontement.Système de combat (PDF FR)
Une dernière spécificité relative à Kaode : il sera possible et parfois nécessaire pour le personnage de prendre personnellement part au combat. En effet, si les tournois et les matchs amateurs mettront principalement en scène des Kaodes, lorsque le joueur devra se défendre contre des brigands, zombies ou autres menaces Kaodiennes et que personne ne sera plus en mesure de le protéger : il sera temps de se défendre !

ICI, un gif-preview des combats !
Parce que depuis le début, nous travaillons avec l'équipe sur un jeu collaboratif de manière bénévole, et que nous souhaitons conserver un esprit libre dans la conception et le scénario.En France, lorsque l'on n'appartient pas à une grosse structure, les seules possibilités de financement sont celles apportés par les financement régionaux (accordés une fois par an) ou l'aide du CNC (Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée) comprenant trois sessions pas an, un jury de 13 personnes appartenant au monde du jeu.
C'est un peu : pistons, contraintes et marché contre un concept qui colle à l'esprit de Kaode : entraide, liberté et aventure humaine.
Dans ce cas, pourquoi ne pas demander un peu d'aide à nos joueurs...à vous ; que les rêveurs aident les rêveurs... non ?
Pour vous prouver que nous avons quand même la tête sur les épaules, voici une estimation de notre budget et une étude de marché réalisée par notre responsable marketing et conseiller financier :Etude de marché light (PDF FR)
Pour revenir au financement participatif, nous avons décidé une approche par paliers, avec dans un premier temps ce qui nous est absolument nécessaire.
Les échelons successifs nous permettraient de véritablement passer un cap, en nous autorisant une communication de masse, une production de goodies super funs et nous laissant la possibilité d'aller plus loin dans la mise en place et l'élaboration du jeu.Voici les paliers en détails :Palier 1 - Graphisme et premiers frais : 1550 euros
Avec cet argent, nous pourrions engager une graphiste pour finir la carte du monde de Kaode, proposer des animations et des mini-maps pour les 50 à 70 lieux prévus.
En somme : transformer un jeu de rôle papier en jeu-vidéo.
Nous pourrions aussi rembourser nos frais de dossiers, payer l'hébergement du serveur etc...Palier 2 - Communication et goodies: (+750) 2300 euros
Kaode chez toi, Kaode dans la rue, Kaode partout !
Une bonne communication (avoir un attaché de presse, faire les salons du jeu, produire : T-shirts, affiches, flyers, panneaux cartonnées, mugs...) voudrait dire plus de joueurs.
Ça paraît peut-être simple et bateau, mais dans les faits : cela voudrait dire un monde plus intéressant, plus d'échanges et d'investissement de la part de la communauté des joueurs, et donc plus de mouvement et d'évolutions dans le jeu : si Kaode fonctionne même au bout de quelques mois, nous pourrions continuer à développer au même rythme, continuer d'écrire lieux et événements, ajouter de nouvelles fonctionnalités, créer encore et toujours !




Si le palier 1 validerait la sortie du jeu ; la palier 2 assurerait un lancement en bonne et due forme ; nous permettant d'avoir une certaine quantité de joueur dès la sortie de la beta.Palier 3 – Kaode IRL (dans la vraie vie) – (+850) 3150 euros
Entre joueurs, on ne va pas se mentir, et surtout depuis les 90's : avoir une représentation physique de nos créatures, ou personnages de comics, cartoon et jeux vidéo, c'est vraiment cool.
Avec l'essor (relatif) de l'impression 3D, nos recherches nous ont poussé à côtoyer des modélisateurs et autres passionnés du milieu de la 3D.
Effleurant l'idée d'avoir notre propre gamme, nous avons travaillé quelques patrons, et l'on commence à avoir certaines versions de Kaodes en 3D.

Voici une impression test, un exemple basique de l'une des créatures du jeu, la « phobie des couteaux » dessinée par Arthur Besson : « Chickenife » !Jookoki de Roman !            !!                    Arachniège, par Sylvain Guidotti !        A venir :  Slim !                 


Pour l'instant, seules quelques entreprises ou laboratoires permettent l'impression d'objets en plastique comme celui-ci à grande échelle. Il suffirait cependant d'un petit modèle d'imprimante pour nous permettre une certaine quantité de production.
C'est pourquoi, si vous nous aidez à obtenir une imprimante, nous pourrions créer une large gamme de figurines en 3 dimensions, à faible coût, et donc : à petit prix pour vous !Palier 4 – Aller plus loin...et enveloppe collaborateurs ! ( 3150+)Nous sommes actuellement 14 membres officiels sur le projet, sans compter les innombrables conseils et rencontres qui font de ce projet une si jolie expérience.Voici en quelques mots :

I just wrote a very enjoyable email to Rough Trade (the label), informing them of our staggering victory. This app is going to rock so hard. Really, you have no idea how gleefully grateful we are. What next? It looks like people are still giving, so if we get enough, we'll apply for a two year, instead of a one year licence. Thank you sincerely, Andrew + Tom (two very happy chaps) x <br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">UPDATE: 22 September 2011 - </span>Three-quarters there! So close ... so close. I just hope we don't fall at the final hurdle. Spoken to Rough Trade and they love it. A lot of people have been asking about the limited edition print - sorry it took us so long but we wanted it to be just right (click on the thumbnail above to see a larger version). I think you'll agree, it is rather special. Tom outdid himself. We're only printing 75 of these babies, so don't miss out. Oh and they're A3 in size, by the way.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">UPDATE: 16 September 2011 - </span>NO WAY! I've been away in The Netherlands, attending DiGRA (which has been pretty awesome so far. If you guys like what we're doing, check out what the ex-mayor of Bogota <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antanas_Mockus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Antanas Mockus</a> did - when in power, he drafted 400 mimes onto the streets to mock people who transgressed traffic laws because the police were too inept. It worked! Look up the doc 'Cities on Speed' on youtube). Anyway, I've not had the chance to check up that often on our progress here and I am overwhelmed that we are now officially over half way - and also just over half way through the month. So, amazingly, we are well on the track to victory. Right now, I'm feeling a mixture of humility, gratefulness and guilt. THANK YOU!</p>
<br/><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">UPDATE: 13 September 2011</span> - Thank you everyone who's put their wallet on the line so far! Things are going rather well although it's way too early to say whether we'll actually make our goal or not. And if we're even one dollar short, it all gets returned - so nervous times here down in the bunker. A common question we've been getting is ""Why not Android/Web/Steam?"" We feel your pain. The iPhone was the natural platform to launch on as an experiment, but if it proves worthwhile, our next step is definitely to port it onto Android and possibly the web too.  <br/></p>
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Andrew Sheerin and Tom Morgan-Jones. We run a small, satirical games publishing company called <a href=""http://www.terrorbullgames.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""TerrorBull Games, purveyors of fine, satirical games"">TerrorBull Games</a> that uses games as a way to challenge players and provoke thought, as well as entertain.<br/><br/>We believe games are brilliantly suited to tackle ""serious"" subjects without being preachy, dull or depressing. Additionally, their interactive nature means that when you play one of our games, you become part of the problem. And that's the quickest way to learn how to solve it.<br/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A few years ago, we designed <a href=""http://www.waronterrortheboardgame.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""War on Terror, the board game"">War on Terror, the boardgame</a>. It achieved many weird and wonderful things - it got banned by shops, seized by the police, exhibited as art and has resulted in probably hundreds, if not thousands, of falling-outs and break-ups (and its fair share of hook-ups). <br/><br/>But the really amazing thing is the effect it has had on certain individuals. We've received some humbling and moving letters from terrorist attack survivors telling us our game helped them laugh at the subject after years of anxiety and depression and from soldiers serving on the front line of the real war on terror, sharing with us how our game (yes, they play it out there to unwind) made them question what they were doing. There's no such thing as ""just a game"". They can affect lasting and positive change.<br/><br/>For all its successes, War on Terror is still pretty niche, pretty underground. (For example, few people know that our game came first, and then they named the war after it because it sounded so catchy). So now we're making a digital version of the game for the iPhone in the hope of reaching a whole new audience of satirical game enthusiasts. <br/><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's really simple. We've done the hard work and the app's almost finished. All we need is the perfect piece of music to play out the game. ""Cunts Are Still Running The World"" by Jarvis Cocker is that piece of music. If you don't know it, youtube it right now. It's funny, angry, subversive - everything we want our game to be.<br/><br/>We've talked to Rough Trade and they have given us a very fair offer of £1200 to licence this track. And that's where we need your help. We've spent so much on booze, fuelling the development of the game, that we have nothing left for music licences.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Funding Levels:</span><br/><br/></p>

UPDATE: 29 September 2011 - YOU CHUFFING DID IT!! YOU BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!!! I can't quite believe we got there. I just wrote a very enjoyable email to Rough Trade (the label), informing them of our staggering victory. This app is going to rock so hard. Really, you have no idea how gleefully grateful we are. What next? It looks like people are still giving, so if we get enough, we'll apply for a two year, instead of a one year licence. Thank you sincerely, Andrew + Tom (two very happy chaps) x 

UPDATE: 22 September 2011 - Three-quarters there! So close ... so close. I just hope we don't fall at the final hurdle. Spoken to Rough Trade and they love it. A lot of people have been asking about the limited edition print - sorry it took us so long but we wanted it to be just right (click on the thumbnail above to see a larger version). I think you'll agree, it is rather special. Tom outdid himself. We're only printing 75 of these babies, so don't miss out. Oh and they're A3 in size, by the way.

UPDATE: 16 September 2011 - NO WAY! I've been away in The Netherlands, attending DiGRA (which has been pretty awesome so far. If you guys like what we're doing, check out what the ex-mayor of Bogota Antanas Mockus did - when in power, he drafted 400 mimes onto the streets to mock people who transgressed traffic laws because the police were too inept. It worked! Look up the doc 'Cities on Speed' on youtube). Anyway, I've not had the chance to check up that often on our progress here and I am overwhelmed that we are now officially over half way - and also just over half way through the month. So, amazingly, we are well on the track to victory. Right now, I'm feeling a mixture of humility, gratefulness and guilt. THANK YOU!
UPDATE: 13 September 2011 - Thank you everyone who's put their wallet on the line so far! Things are going rather well although it's way too early to say whether we'll actually make our goal or not. And if we're even one dollar short, it all gets returned - so nervous times here down in the bunker. A common question we've been getting is ""Why not Android/Web/Steam?"" We feel your pain. The iPhone was the natural platform to launch on as an experiment, but if it proves worthwhile, our next step is definitely to port it onto Android and possibly the web too.  

Our Story
We are Andrew Sheerin and Tom Morgan-Jones. We run a small, satirical games publishing company called TerrorBull Games that uses games as a way to challenge players and provoke thought, as well as entertain.We believe games are brilliantly suited to tackle ""serious"" subjects without being preachy, dull or depressing. Additionally, their interactive nature means that when you play one of our games, you become part of the problem. And that's the quickest way to learn how to solve it.


The Impact
A few years ago, we designed War on Terror, the boardgame. It achieved many weird and wonderful things - it got banned by shops, seized by the police, exhibited as art and has resulted in probably hundreds, if not thousands, of falling-outs and break-ups (and its fair share of hook-ups). But the really amazing thing is the effect it has had on certain individuals. We've received some humbling and moving letters from terrorist attack survivors telling us our game helped them laugh at the subject after years of anxiety and depression and from soldiers serving on the front line of the real war on terror, sharing with us how our game (yes, they play it out there to unwind) made them question what they were doing. There's no such thing as ""just a game"". They can affect lasting and positive change.For all its successes, War on Terror is still pretty niche, pretty underground. (For example, few people know that our game came first, and then they named the war after it because it sounded so catchy). So now we're making a digital version of the game for the iPhone in the hope of reaching a whole new audience of satirical game enthusiasts. 


What We Need & What You Get
It's really simple. We've done the hard work and the app's almost finished. All we need is the perfect piece of music to play out the game. ""Cunts Are Still Running The World"" by Jarvis Cocker is that piece of music. If you don't know it, youtube it right now. It's funny, angry, subversive - everything we want our game to be.We've talked to Rough Trade and they have given us a very fair offer of £1200 to licence this track. And that's where we need your help. We've spent so much on booze, fuelling the development of the game, that we have nothing left for music licences.Funding Levels:


ANY AMOUNT: We will email you a digital ""Rosette of Participation!"" You can proudly display this on your desktop, or email it to your Mum. Make her proud.

£20 or $35: We will send you a signed, limited edition ""Cash for Cunts"" commemorative poster by award-winning illustrator, Tom Morgan-Jones (who does all our game illustrations)

£50 or $85: You'll get all of the above AND a special mention in the credits of our game

£1000 or $1,700: For you rich cunts out there, a special platinum-level of funding. If you pledge this much, then we will come round your house and host a War on Terror games evening with you and your mates. We will leave you with many happy memories, that's a guarantee. Well, the memories are guaranteed, the happiness isn't.

Remember, if we don't raise the full amount, everyone gets their pledges back. And if by some kind stroke of fate we manage to raise more than we need, we'll put it towards the development of our next satirical blockbuster.

            Att skapa en fullvÃ¤rdig svensk version av Dungeons&amp;Dragons. NybÃ¶rjarversion, basregler,

<h3>
            Lite bakgrund</h3>
<p>
            Jag har spelat D&amp;D sedan 1974 och varit inblandad hÃ¶gt och lÃ¥gt i svenskt rollspelande
            under dess fÃ¶rsta Ã¥rtionden. I ett fÃ¶rsÃ¶k att gÃ¶ra D&amp;D mer tillgÃ¤ngligt fÃ¶r
            svenskar, Ã¶versatte vi pÃ¥ Titan Games tvÃ¥ av regellÃ¥dorna och fem Ã¤ventyr i mitten
            av Ã¥ttiotalet. Det var dyrt att gÃ¶ra och jag blev kvar pÃ¥ det sjunkande skeppet
            Titan till det bittra slutet 1990. Den miljonskuld som Ã¤ventyret skapade kÃ¤mpade
            jag med i nÃ¤stan femton Ã¥r fÃ¶r att bli av med och effekten av att inte kunna spara
            ihop eller investera en enda krona under sÃ¥ lÃ¥ng tid, lider jag fortfarande av.</p>
<p>
            I slutet av denna efterdyning fick D&amp;D den stÃ¶rsta present spelet nÃ¥gonsin fÃ¥tt
            – OGL. PlÃ¶tsligt var mitt favoritspel i det nÃ¤rmaste Open Source och jag kunde
            fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka gÃ¶ra en svensk version igen. Under de Ã¥r som gick, och under tvÃ¥ jobbiga
            skilsmÃ¤ssor, Ã¶versatte jag sÃ¥ mycket jag orkade av D&amp;D-reglerna och lade ut
            som PDF:er.</p>
<p>
            Det senaste Ã¥ret har dock livet fÃ¥tt sig ett antal rejÃ¤la tÃ¶rnar och min ekonomi
            har, av mÃ¥nga olika anledningar, bÃ¶rjat vackla igen. Medan andra tillbringade nyÃ¥rsnatten
            med att gÃ¶ra fÃ¶rhoppningsfulla lÃ¶ften om trÃ¤ning och annat nyttigt, fÃ¶rsÃ¶kte jag
            tÃ¤nka igenom hur jag alls skall kunna ta mig igenom 2012. SÃ¥ som lÃ¤get Ã¤r just nu
            mÃ¥ste jag fokusera tillvaron och lÃ¤gga Ã¥t sidan allt som inte Ã¤r livsnÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt.
            TyvÃ¤rr Ã¤r Dunder&amp;Drakar inte det. Skapa rollspel har alltid kostat mig bÃ¥de tid

<p>
            Eftersom mycket av min oro Ã¤r ekonomisk, skulle en insamling kunna hindra projektet
            frÃ¥n att lÃ¤ggas i malpÃ¥se. Dels skulle en fÃ¶rbÃ¤ttrad ekonomi ge mig hopp och kraft
            och dels skulle jag inte behÃ¶va jobba 50-60 timmar i veckan fÃ¶r att precis fÃ¥ ihop
            till mat och boende.</p>
<p>
            Det sÃ¤gs ju att svÃ¤rmen kan utrÃ¤tta storverk, men just nu Ã¶nskar jag bara en ekonomisk
            mÃ¶jlighet att kunna ta fram ett komplett Dunder&amp;Drakar under 2012. Annars fÃ¥r jag

</div></div>","The Gate of Realms is a fantasy action/adventure role-playing video game about a settlement that has uncovered an ancient portal in a cavern underneath the city. Upon closer inspection, the portal was activated. It was found to take anyone who dares to enter to an ever changing realm full of discovery, riches, and danger. Create your own character and play solo or with up to 4 friends. Uncover the mysteries of the portal and claim new powers and riches within the gate of realms!

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As with all health-related issues, it is important to learn healthy behavior (such as eating healthy, exercising, listening to your body, and avoiding destructive behavior). We realize that behavioral change can be achieved; but this is a process and change will not occur over night. Most people are unaware how long they use the mouse or just leave their hand on the mouse without mousing. This is why we have developed not just an ergonomic mouse, but an </span><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">ergonomic mouse which helps you to modify behavior.</strong><br/></p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Why ergonomic mousing?</span><br/>
</h1>
<p>With office work; the average person uses mouse and keyboard at least 6 hours per day. Based upon a 5 day work week this can result in about 7 full years of your life behind the computer! Understanding the relationship from human to the equipment is the first step. Followed with a proper workstation set-up. Lastly to avoid physical complaints the body should adopt a naturally, relaxed posture. This is obtainable with ergonomic tools by combining the user with the ergonomic R-Go Break Mouse.</p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What makes the R-Go Break Mouse unique?</span><br/>
</h1>
<p>The R-Go Break mouse indicates with color signals how healthy you work: </p>
<p>Green means""good to go"", Orange means that you should take a little (micro) break and Red means that you forgot to take your break or that your total daily mousing hours are exceeded. By using (the similar functions of) trafficlight color indication simple, positive feedback is provided about healthy behavior of the user. The individual is encouraged to take frequent short breaks. These vital breaks will prevent overload of small muscles and tendons in the arm, wrist and hand while help the individual to easily (all be it subconsciously) change his/her behavior. </p>
<p>As this idea to combine a healthy posture with visual indication to stimulate healthy behavior is completely NEW, we protected the idea and patented the technology for use on any input device! </p>

The mouse has 2 buttons on the front (right and left click) and a scrollwheel in the middle. Besides, a forward and backward button are located in the thumbrest.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The shape of the mouse that is used as base for the R-Go Break Mouse is similar to the HE-Mouse (developed several years ago and awarded for best input device in 2013 in The Netherlands). The R-Go Break Mouse has a vertical grip which provides a neutral, relaxed position of the hand and wrist. You move from the forearm instead of your wrist, which prevents RSI. The mouse fits comfortably in your hand, and supports your wrist and fingers.<br/></span></p>

<h1>We need your support</h1>
<p>We have been working hard to create the best ergonomic product possible, have it patented and now we want to release it to the world ASAP! We have finalized the prototype and currently are testing it. Now we need your help to get the tools financed to start volume production. Will you help us, so we can help you to work healthy behind your computer? </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><p></p></div>","Did you know that about one third of all computer users suffer from RSI-related complaints? Posture and behavior are two significant contributors.  
The R-Go Break Mouse is an ergonomic vertical mouse that stimulates to keep the hand and arm in a natural position and indicates with colors how healthy you work!

As with all health-related issues, it is important to learn healthy behavior (such as eating healthy, exercising, listening to your body, and avoiding destructive behavior). We realize that behavioral change can be achieved; but this is a process and change will not occur over night. Most people are unaware how long they use the mouse or just leave their hand on the mouse without mousing. This is why we have developed not just an ergonomic mouse, but an ergonomic mouse which helps you to modify behavior.






Why ergonomic mousing?

With office work; the average person uses mouse and keyboard at least 6 hours per day. Based upon a 5 day work week this can result in about 7 full years of your life behind the computer! Understanding the relationship from human to the equipment is the first step. Followed with a proper workstation set-up. Lastly to avoid physical complaints the body should adopt a naturally, relaxed posture. This is obtainable with ergonomic tools by combining the user with the ergonomic R-Go Break Mouse.
The R-Go Break mouse:
- Indicates with color signals how healthy you work and when to take a break!
- Ensures you to move the mouse with the arm instead of the wrist
- Is a unique technology with ""patent pending""
- Has an ergonomic vertical shape to eliminate twisting of the forearm



What makes the R-Go Break Mouse unique?

The R-Go Break mouse indicates with color signals how healthy you work: 
Green means""good to go"", Orange means that you should take a little (micro) break and Red means that you forgot to take your break or that your total daily mousing hours are exceeded. By using (the similar functions of) trafficlight color indication simple, positive feedback is provided about healthy behavior of the user. The individual is encouraged to take frequent short breaks. These vital breaks will prevent overload of small muscles and tendons in the arm, wrist and hand while help the individual to easily (all be it subconsciously) change his/her behavior. 
As this idea to combine a healthy posture with visual indication to stimulate healthy behavior is completely NEW, we protected the idea and patented the technology for use on any input device! 







Technical Features
The R-Go Break Mouse is a lasermouse with adjustable DPI settings to 500, 1000,1800 and 2500 DPI! The mouse has 2 buttons on the front (right and left click) and a scrollwheel in the middle. Besides, a forward and backward button are located in the thumbrest. The Mouse is currently compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux.  
The mouse works with the standard Windows mouse driver. The application for the color indication was built in .NET and uses the HID-library to communicate with the mouse. 
Project Development

For over a year we have been working on the R-Go Break mouse.  In 2015 the finitial concept was developed. Together with electronic experts we developed the electronics to ensure the light could be controlled by the computer. 



The shape of the mouse that is used as base for the R-Go Break Mouse is similar to the HE-Mouse (developed several years ago and awarded for best input device in 2013 in The Netherlands). The R-Go Break Mouse has a vertical grip which provides a neutral, relaxed position of the hand and wrist. You move from the forearm instead of your wrist, which prevents RSI. The mouse fits comfortably in your hand, and supports your wrist and fingers.


Soon after we developed the concept we formed the R-Go Break -team and started working on the first prototype. When the technical details were defined in a functional requirement specification we had all the information to start the development of a prototype. 



The design of the R-Go Break Mouse as you see today was completed in May 2016. In the meantime we started the development of the production tools to prepare for starting production. 


The Team
The idea of R-Go Break was born by a cooperation between ergonomic experts, technical designers and marketing experts!
Vincent Bons Msc. and Anita Heij Bsc. (ergonomic consultant) were the inventors of the concept. Vincent is the technical lead for the project.
Daniel van Meeuwen LLM developed the functional specifications and Daniel will ensure all required certifications and documents will be available.
Steven, Job and Iris are responsible for the design of packaging and marketing materials.
Herman will ensure orders will be delivered in time
Jeroen Verbeek Msc. is responsible to bring the R-Go Break Mouse into the retail shelves.

<p>The idea and set up of Boating Buddy originally came about through a Sheffield based company named Think On! that supports innovation and young entrepreneurs.

<p>Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be one of the individuals they agreed to help...and so Boating Buddy was born!</p>
<p><strong>What is the Boating Buddy?</strong></p>
<p>Boating Buddy is a simple dive system aimed at depths up to 10m to enable crew to be able to free ropes around propellers, clear mooring &amp; anchor lines, assess and fix below water level damage, hull cleaning and general maintenance. <strong>Not to mention shallow diving for pleasure!!!</strong></p>
<p>The system consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a compact compressor that attaches to the boat battery, </li>
<li>a length of pipe attaching the compressor to a second stage regulator (mouth piece), </li>
<li>an emergency life jacket</li>
<li>a diving mask </li>
<li>a diving knife. </li>
<li>all in one simple, easy to use Boating Buddy bag!</li>
</ul>
The system is exceedingly compact and can be stowed easily on board for use when required. Unlike carrying a diving tank, which will probably have been drained for pleasure diving, this will always provide an air source.

<p>Once we've mastered the Design phase, we'll transcend over to the ""Production"" phase. What's the ""Production Phase""? - Well, my friend, it's the meat and bones of making video-games; Actually bringing your idea to life. We'll be using Unreal Engine 4 to turn your dreams into reality and to make sure your game is ""Next-Gen"" compatible!</p>
<p>Once we complete the project, we'll jump on over to the ""Release"" phase, in which I'll help guide you through where you can sell your project, who to talk to in terms of getting your project some exposure as well as submitting your project to Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Steam.</p>
<p>We'll also be learning about Photoshop, Blender, FL Studio, Audacity, Unreal Engine 4 and Google Drive and how they help us on this adventure to creating our Dream Video-Game!</p>
<p>How does that sound to you? To me it sounds like a huge adventure in which I can't wait to get started! Do you want to know the best part? I hope to release this whole adventure for the grand total of £0 (US: $0, Euro: 0, Everywhere else: $0). But before we do, I need your help!

<p>In order to bring this project to life; I've turned to you all for help. Why? Because in order to create the book, I need some funding or it won't be possible! </p>
<p>This is because in order to take the time out to write the book, Funding helps me focus on the book, so there is no need to get alternative employment to fund the book myself. This means that the book can come out faster; And of the highest possible quality!</p>

</div></div>","Games are awesome. Making games is awesome. You are awesome. Mix these together and what do you get? ... AWESOME³ !
Have you ever sat there while playing a game thinking: ""Man, this level sucks. I could do better if I just knew how! "", I mean haven't we all thought that at least once? 
How about sitting through a game and thinking ""Man, this story is getting seriously boring. I wish I could make my own game. I'd make it 100 times more awesome than this!""
Well, that's why I'm here today - To give you thesuperpowers to create the video-games of your dreams. Well alright, they're not really superpowers, but what I am giving you is the knowledge and skills you'll need to be able to create your very own video-game !



The goal of the project is to teach every child, adult and elder how to create video-games in an easy, fun and enjoyable experience! The book will be available digitally for free and for the cost of printing in physical form. I will be sending the book to as many libraries around the World to help get it in front of as many children, adults and elderly people as possible so everyone can create their dream video-game.With the funding, I will also be able to translate the book into multiple languages; So every single person on the planet will be able to create their dream video-game!




My name is Ryan Shah! I'm a published writer and Lead Developer @ Kitatus Studios! 


Boasting over 10 years of experience creating video-games, I have worked on an assortment of different programs to create video-game experiences. 
Before creating video-games, I was a freelance Writer; Self-Publishing my own stories.
And now, I'm here to teach anyone and everyone who wants to join the Game Development industry. I had a dream of showing as many people the ropes to Game Development as possible; Helping them to dive right in and that's why I'm here.


Before doing this, I wrote and published a FREE Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints book, to teach as many people as possible about Unreal Engine 4 and how it's so simple to create your own video-games WITHOUT writing a line of code! 

A link to this FREE book is available here: CLICK ME.
I enjoyed writing this book so much that I wanted to continue to do so; But I wanted to expand. I wanted to help teach not just Unreal Engine 4 users, but people who want to make video-games, but they don't know how. AND THUS... ""So You Want To Make A Video-Game?"" was born!



We'll start from the top, making sure we nail every detail of our dream game before bringing it to life. But don't worry about walls and walls of text, oh no. This adventure will be filled with fun, excitement, doodles and screenshots all aimed at making sure you're having the fun you deserve while creating the game that you've been itching to create!
From the planning phase, we'll go straight into making concept art and continue head-on into the Design phase; This means planning how the levels will look, what the characters will look like and many awesome things all to do with designing our game!
Once we've mastered the Design phase, we'll transcend over to the ""Production"" phase. What's the ""Production Phase""? - Well, my friend, it's the meat and bones of making video-games; Actually bringing your idea to life. We'll be using Unreal Engine 4 to turn your dreams into reality and to make sure your game is ""Next-Gen"" compatible!
Once we complete the project, we'll jump on over to the ""Release"" phase, in which I'll help guide you through where you can sell your project, who to talk to in terms of getting your project some exposure as well as submitting your project to Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Steam.
We'll also be learning about Photoshop, Blender, FL Studio, Audacity, Unreal Engine 4 and Google Drive and how they help us on this adventure to creating our Dream Video-Game!
How does that sound to you? To me it sounds like a huge adventure in which I can't wait to get started! Do you want to know the best part? I hope to release this whole adventure for the grand total of £0 (US: $0, Euro: 0, Everywhere else: $0). But before we do, I need your help! In order to bring this adventure to life, I need as much help as I can get to help fund the book. 



In order to bring this project to life; I've turned to you all for help. Why? Because in order to create the book, I need some funding or it won't be possible! 
This is because in order to take the time out to write the book, Funding helps me focus on the book, so there is no need to get alternative employment to fund the book myself. This means that the book can come out faster; And of the highest possible quality!
Another reason why funding is essential to the book is storage; In order to put all of the content of the book online (So you can use it in your own projects, take it apart to see how it ticks or refer to it if you get stuck), I need to purchase a server to store all of this content. And they don't come cheap!
So not only will the funding help the FREE book come out Faster; But the book will be of the highest possibly quality and will have a dedicated server for every single piece of content in the book (For your own non-commercial and commercial uses!)
I am also planning of sending the book to multiple libraries all over the World, as well paying for translators to translate the book into as many languages as possible, to help get every child, adult and elder who wants to create video-games doing so!
This all isn't a cheap endeavour; Banks would laugh at me for trying to create free content, so I have turned to you wonderful people. And to thank-you for your contributions; I have set up a few Perks such as your name credited in the book, exclusive versions of the book and even a free copy of my video-game Super Distro Horizons!

These sheets cannot be chosen as part of your standard reward sheets due to this higher cost.If you ONLY want these steel blades please pledge the relevant amount based on the above pricing and then set your perk at any level below that amount. We will ask what you actually want in the survey at the end of the campaign.$5000 Strech Goal - 54mm Steel Blades! -UNLOCKED!!We've now unlocked the 54mm details sheet stretch goal, we are still deciding if this should be a one-sided brass sheet or a double-sided stainless steel sheet but will include various blades, shields and details in 54mm/2"" or 1/35th scale.Please comment on the comments page and let us know which you would prefer, pics of the sheet coming at the end of the week!Look for more details and stretch-goal designs coming as the campaign progresses!",14.0,0,"3 Campaigns

We're getting very close to the wider Alpha for everyone who has that item in their Perk.Alpha has been announced for March 3rd (PST).GameGlass is well into development, we have the Flight Systems and Shields & Combat Shards up and working, and implementation is underway on the Social Shard.Our current plan is to release move on to a Beta in late March/early April.If you'd like to take a deeper look at GameGlass in operation, you can check out our YouTube channel here.  When we launch, you'll be able to choose between the basic Shards that come with a free account, a simple subscription for everything, or once-off Shard purchases. If you'd like to get in early though, we've put together some perks that give you great discounts on subscriptions and bonuses. We're also offering special lifetime perks. These will give you access to every Shard for every game we support, for ever. These will only be available during this campaign.6 MonthsThis gives you 6 months of access to all games and Shards. Starting from when we release (not Alpha or Beta).Annual1 year of access to all the games on GameGlass, and all their Shards. We'll announce the roadmap of games we intend to support soon, but expect more space and flight sims, RPGs, and even MOBAs. All built with the same level of care, immersion and ease of use you see in our Star Citizen Shards. And obviously this will start when we release.  Depending on the perk level you choose, you will get a different package of benefits. These include:Beta - A larger testing wave, focused on polish. We're aiming for MarchAll games - You will be able to access GameGlass features for every game we support. Bring your own copy of the games though, that's not includedAll Shards - Use every Shard for a game, instead of just the base Shards that come with the free GameGlass account  Our plans for Alpha and Beta currently include only the Flight Systems and Shields & Combat Shards. But since announcing the project we've also been flooded with requests to help get this made faster. All the excitement, hype and positive encouragement has pushed us to aim higher. So if we reach our funding goal we'll be able to add two new Shards to the Beta (they're unlikely to be in the Alpha).MiningUsing an intuitive gesture-based interface you will be able to manage your mining beam throttle, scan for valuable mining resources, and even view data on profitable minerals, routes, and locations.Ground VehiclesVehicles have many different functions to ships, and we have some very cool plans for an interface for interacting with vehicle systems, including the basics such as lights and power, plus extras like turrets and scanners.  $10,000 - Ship Databank Shard (FUNDED)
 A Shard filled with data and intelligence for all the ships in Star Citizen - right inside GameGlass.Use it to help find the right ship for your mission by looking up cargo space, QT range etc.Or use it to help plan tactics for that juicy ""adversarial acquisition"" target by looking up shield capacity, hard points and speed.Hitting this stretch goal will let us accelerate development of this Shard by adding a new team member (or contractor) to tackle it. It won't be included in the very initial release of GameGlass, but will come out approx. 2 months sooner than it would otherwise. $25,000 - Themes & Visuals (FUNDED)
 You'll be able to swap visual themes for Star Citizen Shards, using simple game preferences.We want these to be visually impactful, including new animations, artwork and colour shifts.Some Shards will see large visual changes, including including new animations and artwork. For example we want to create bespoke themes for each ship manufacturer that will apply to the Flight System and Shields & Combat Shards.Themes for other Shards may focus more on colour shifts.Hitting this stretch goal will allow us to accelerate delivery of this feature, adding it to GameGlass approx. 3 months earlier.Please note - changing visual themes will not be a feature included in the free tier of GameGlass.
$50,000 - Mobile & Fragments (FUNDED) GameGlass has always been designed to evolve as we add support for new games, and create new Shards. But we've not yet talked about how it can evolve to meet your personal, unique needs.We design primarily around tablets for our Shards, they're a good size for our layouts and for accurate touch.But not everyone has a tablet. You all have mobile phones though, right? (sorry)What if you just want to prop your phone up next to your screen? What if you have a few old phones you'd like to arrange around your monitor, like the cockpit of your favorite ship?We didn't just want to do a smaller mobile version of our Shards. Instead we designed a new, modular way to give you tightly focused pieces of Shards, and let you decide where they go.We call them Fragments.Let's take the Shields & Combat Shard for example. It has three sections: power, targeting and shields.Each of these sections is a Fragment, and we've designed them to fit neatly on your mobile phone. (early concept)You can easily select which Fragment is shown on each of your connected devices, mixing and matching Fragments to suit your personal needs. (early concept) Maybe a scanning Fragment next to your joystick during exploration runs?Perhaps an ""industrial"" array below your monitor, with Fragments for Mining, Trade and Shields?You decide which Fragments to use, and which devices they appear on.Another great thing about our Fragment tech is they enable you to customize a dashboard on your tablet. You can pick any two Fragments and display them side by side. Giving you flexibility to create a layout that suits your mission or activity. (early concept) While Fragments are designed for mobile phones, you're not forced to use them. If you have a large phone you can choose to use the standard tablet layouts.If we hit the $50,000 goal we will create Fragments for Flight Systems Shields & Combat and the social shards, and make them available when GameGlass goes live or within the first update.Hitting this goal during this campaign allows us to accelerate development of this feature and deliver these Fragments approx. 4 months early. $100,000 and beyond Hey everyone.Fragments are coming!We just posted an update to our Indiegogo campaign page, you can check it out here -https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gameglass-po...We're going to take a break from stretch goals for a while. We want to focus on making the features we've committed to as amazing as possible. We have a few ideas though, and after we've done some scouting we'll report back on where we aim from here. Stay tuned. Big things are on the way. The GameGlass team.  GameGlass was co-founded by Andy Lee and Craig Sartor. Craig had been working on SCPADD, which was teased to the community resulting in a wave of hype. Andy had been working on a platform for uniting companion-apps for games in a single place. Andy has over 15 years experience managing software delivery teams, designing marketing campaigns and running business operations. He's the marketing and business guy.Craig has been a full-stack developer and digital marketing designer for many years. He's the design and product guy.They quickly formed a new team to accelerate their efforts, and have been added 3 other members. Mike S wrote the client app that underpins much of how GameGlass works, and with his expertise in software security helps ensure your data is locked down.Sjoerd Arendsen is building our server architecture from sunny Amsterdam, and is responsible for much of the core platform features. All GameGlass content and interfaces are copyright of GameGlass Inc.

Caladon Falls is Savage Mojo’s first foray into fantasy setting books designed for Savage Suzerain, using Pinnacle's award-winning Savage Worlds rules. Kicked off in November as a PDF, we’ve been asked repeatedly when it will be in print. With your help, we’d like to answer that with, “Before Gen Con 2011!”
As the trailer shows, there are a lot of people who have worked their hearts out to produce a top-notch, high-art, high-quality roleplaying game (RPG) book packed with stunning visuals, intriguing plots, and inventive prose. Caladon Falls is brought to you by names you’ll know and those we hope will become some of your new favorites. And every one of us wants you to experience Caladon Falls the most complete way possible: by owning it for yourself – in print.
Those Names You Know
We are fortunate to have a combination of established talent and people breaking into the business. Fresh ideas, a ton of energy, and experience abound, culminating in collaborative creations just not likely without both groups. Here are a few people who worked on the Caladon Falls project that you might recognize:



Aaron Acevedo - award-winning artist, longtime Savage Worlds contributor, and former art director at Pinnacle (Evernight, Deadlands: Reloaded (Origins Award Winner), Solomon Kane, Slipstream, Pirates of the Spanish Main). 



Phil Brucato - award-winning author best known for Mage: The Ascension, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, Mage: The Sorcerer' Crusade, and Deliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium. 


Jason Engle - award-winning Dungeons & Dragons, L5R, Star Wars, World of Warcraft, and Magic the Gathering artist.


John Wick - award-winning creator of L5R, 7th Sea, and Houses of the Blooded.  


The Impact
Funds raised through this campaign go toward the production costs of a 750 book, limited edition print-run for Caladon Falls in its full glory. Each book is hard cover containing full-color interiors on high-quality paper. Those who choose to support us at qualifying tiers will get a copy shipped to them along with any other goodies at their chosen tier.

What People are Saying about Caladon Falls
Tommy Brownell of The Most Unread Blog Ever bullets his favorite things about Caladon Falls, “Amazing production values as always. More neat new Edges and Hindrances. A unique fantasy campaign with a military theme but a lot of variety that shows what Suzerain can do pre-Heroic rank.”
On DriveThruRPG, Dillard Rape has a lot to say, “Bottom line this is a five star [out of five stars] product…The art is superb. The setting material is enough to get you into the game immediately and Savage Mojo has tons of freebies online. The critters are imaginative. The villains are well thought out and original. It’s a military campaign with your characters as irregular forces.

Book Details
What exactly are Caladon Falls' contents? Good question! Here's the back cover:
They came out of nowhere and started ripping the world apart, one city at a time. Using power on a scale never before seen, Warlocks, godlike leaders of the Wild army, are rampaging on Austeria with one goal: raise armies and annihilate the entire continent. Set in the fantasy realm of Relic, this book looks at warfare through the eyes of everyday people turned soldiers – soldiers whose side is losing the war.

Focus on a daily life and death struggle where the enemy is cruel, powerful, and around every corner. Take the challenge, and let your adventurers become...
...mankind’s only hope.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Long Nguyen, a 3D artist and Game Designer from Canada. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2002, I took the plunge into the world of videogame development and began a small hobby project called 'Out Of Hell', a mod for Unreal Tournament. I spent the next 7 years building the game alone in my spare time, learning about the development process as I went along and growing as an artist over time. The game was finally completed and released to the public in 2009. It won the 'Best Art Direction' award and was nominated for 'Best Single Player Mod' at Mod Database (<a href=""http://www.moddb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.moddb.com</a>)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Now I have set my sights higher and have begun development on a new project, a spiritual successor called '<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Daemonicon</span>' which I plan to take commercial. It is a horror-themed adventure/exploration game with a branching storyline, thick atmosphere and haunting visuals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many ideas that were not included in Out Of Hell will be featured in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Daemonicon</span> such as non-linear exploration, player customization, skill structures, multiple endings and more. You can find additional details about <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Daemonicon</span> at: <a href=""http://crcdevblog.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://crcdevblog.wordpress.com/</a><br/><br/></p>

<h2><b>The Idea of social based games online:</b></h2>
<p>Gaming
is one of the hottest field on the web, That’s because It is just fun, and in
our nature as people we love to have fun!<br/>
When combining a social aspect in a game it become even better! involving other
people that we may know in our games makes it more competitive and interesting.<br/>
So why don`t we build the <b>entire game engine on people actions and
connections</b> that’s sounds like a real fun! a social based gaming!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h2><b><span>First to go...</span></b></h2>
<h2><b><span>Your friends are your soldiers</span></b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Social War Game is the first game in our social gaming platform,
it is an online Facebook game based on the famous simple ""War"" game
card but with a unique twist.<br/>
In the game your deck of cards will be a random 20 Facebook friends that you
already know, you can see their profile picture shown as the cover of the card, but you don’t know for
sure what is their value.<br/>
That’s means that your cards values (that called ""PowerTags"" in the
game) are hidden, so how can you play them? that`s the tricky part – when you recognize your
friend try to guess how active is he on Facebook, the more active your friend will be the greater
""PowerTag"" his card will get.<br/>
When you click to play the card, its ""PowerTag"" reveals both to you
and your opponent, the higher card on stage wins the round.<br/>
In case of a draw an additional card will be placed on the previews in the
stage until one of the cards wins and take all opened cards
on the
stage.<br/>
The winner is the one who grab more cards to his opponentafter
he played
his 20 cards (a battle).<br/>
The points are calculated by the ""PowerTags"" of
the opponentcards
that has been taken, plus a bonus points for each battle victory.</p>

<br/></span></b></h2>
<h2><b><span>The Idea of PowerTag values</span></b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>""PowerTag""
is a value that represent a user strength in a game,
""PowerTag"" values are based on special algorithm compose by numbers of different parameters, thous parameters showing how much active
a
user is on Facebook, some of the parameters are: frequency of posting,
average shares, number of likes, number of comments, usage of albums, photos, friends
tags and much more.<br/>
PowerTag can be very dynamic and change from game to game, this because our
algorithm consider the last friend activities from the past day, week and month,
so a user with a ""10"" PowerTag can be ""J"" or ""9""
in your next game.<br/>
This evaluation method is designed to work with more games in the future
and right now already implemented on SocialWar Game.</p>

<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>The story of the game…</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Not
just an empty card game, there is a story and you (the player) are a part of
it:<br/>
You are a commander and your army squad is build from 20 soldiers – make sure
to know them, they will help you to win the battle, Each soldier have different
value called ""PowerTag"" based on his activity on Facebook.<br/>
Go up in the ranks scale while you win the battles, a level up will give you a
ranks promotion, while you play, it will be harder to get ranks and you will need more battle
victories, so stay tuned, remember your friends PowerTags and use them wisely.</p>

<br/><h2><b>Let`s make it more interesting!</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>To
make the game much interesting and fun we have added two Power Ups:<br/><br/><u>Joker</u> – every level up you will get a Joker, with a Joker your can boost a
soldier PowerTag value and make sure you win the current round, It is wise to
answer with a Joker after your opponent place one of his high PowerTags
soldiers. If you will start a round with a Joker, most chances that your opponent will spare one
of his lowest PowerTags.</p>
<p><u>Grenade</u>
– every 5 levels up you will get a grenade, grenade explosion will eliminate 2 of your opponent
soldiers. Grenade are most useful when you feel that your chances to win are
run out, then one grenade can flip over the game and make you earn that extra
bonus points as you win.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>a Grenade in a game will eliminate two cards from your opponent:</p>

gaming.</p>
<p>We
wanted a relatively simple game to start with, so we can focus in the
common core modules that can be shared and used with more games on the platform, for
example a ""PowerTag"" value of a user can be used in a Blackjack (21) game in the future and
in other games as well.<span>With your support The platform will enable users to play online from the web and
mobile devices while more social networks will be part of the gaming experience.</span></p>

We consider every supporter as part of our team and we will be happy to give
back for your help, so BIG thanks to all of you supporters.Let`s start together the new scene of social based gaming online!




The Idea of social based games online:
Gaming
is one of the hottest field on the web, That’s because It is just fun, and in
our nature as people we love to have fun!
When combining a social aspect in a game it become even better! involving other
people that we may know in our games makes it more competitive and interesting.
So why don`t we build the entire game engine on people actions and
connections that’s sounds like a real fun! a social based gaming!





First to go...
Your friends are your soldiers

Social War Game is the first game in our social gaming platform,
it is an online Facebook game based on the famous simple ""War"" game
card but with a unique twist.
In the game your deck of cards will be a random 20 Facebook friends that you
already know, you can see their profile picture shown as the cover of the card, but you don’t know for
sure what is their value.
That’s means that your cards values (that called ""PowerTags"" in the
game) are hidden, so how can you play them? that`s the tricky part – when you recognize your
friend try to guess how active is he on Facebook, the more active your friend will be the greater
""PowerTag"" his card will get.
When you click to play the card, its ""PowerTag"" reveals both to you
and your opponent, the higher card on stage wins the round.
In case of a draw an additional card will be placed on the previews in the
stage until one of the cards wins and take all opened cards
on the
stage.
The winner is the one who grab more cards to his opponentafter
he played
his 20 cards (a battle).
The points are calculated by the ""PowerTags"" of
the opponentcards
that has been taken, plus a bonus points for each battle victory.





The Idea of PowerTag values

""PowerTag""
is a value that represent a user strength in a game,
""PowerTag"" values are based on special algorithm compose by numbers of different parameters, thous parameters showing how much active
a
user is on Facebook, some of the parameters are: frequency of posting,
average shares, number of likes, number of comments, usage of albums, photos, friends
tags and much more.
PowerTag can be very dynamic and change from game to game, this because our
algorithm consider the last friend activities from the past day, week and month,
so a user with a ""10"" PowerTag can be ""J"" or ""9""
in your next game.
This evaluation method is designed to work with more games in the future
and right now already implemented on SocialWar Game.





The story of the game…


Not
just an empty card game, there is a story and you (the player) are a part of
it:
You are a commander and your army squad is build from 20 soldiers – make sure
to know them, they will help you to win the battle, Each soldier have different
value called ""PowerTag"" based on his activity on Facebook.
Go up in the ranks scale while you win the battles, a level up will give you a
ranks promotion, while you play, it will be harder to get ranks and you will need more battle
victories, so stay tuned, remember your friends PowerTags and use them wisely.





Let`s make it more interesting!

To
make the game much interesting and fun we have added two Power Ups:Joker – every level up you will get a Joker, with a Joker your can boost a
soldier PowerTag value and make sure you win the current round, It is wise to
answer with a Joker after your opponent place one of his high PowerTags
soldiers. If you will start a round with a Joker, most chances that your opponent will spare one
of his lowest PowerTags.
Grenade
– every 5 levels up you will get a grenade, grenade explosion will eliminate 2 of your opponent
soldiers. Grenade are most useful when you feel that your chances to win are
run out, then one grenade can flip over the game and make you earn that extra
bonus points as you win.

a Grenade in a game will eliminate two cards from your opponent:






a Joker in a game will turn one of your friends to a round winner:





You can get points in every battle regardless if you won or not:



Where does it goes from here?

With your support, Online Gaming Platform will specialize in the social gaming, Social War Game will be the first game in a series of online social
gaming.
We
wanted a relatively simple game to start with, so we can focus in the
common core modules that can be shared and used with more games on the platform, for
example a ""PowerTag"" value of a user can be used in a Blackjack (21) game in the future and
in other games as well.With your support The platform will enable users to play online from the web and
mobile devices while more social networks will be part of the gaming experience.

I want to develop a new STI editor that can replace the old STI-Edit because it is not up to the task anymore. It can not handle the high resolution files introduced in <b>Jagged Alliance 2 1.13</b> and behaves rather buggy on modern operating systems, plus I want to have more features at my disposal without constantly switching between programs. Unfortunately my personal situation does not allow me to spend much time on the project, a possible release date would most likely be more than 18 months into the future. Assuming I spent all my free time on it, that is.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/367958/files/20140213074757-JA2_Perspective_Experiment__on_top_of_screenshot_.png?1392306477"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p>
<b>Who I Am</b><br/></p>
My name is Tox and I am currently studying <i>Communication &amp; Multimedia Design</i> in the Netherlands. In the past I have spent countless hours hacking <b>Jagged Alliance 2</b>. In 2000 I started the project <b>Lords of the Bytes</b> with two fellow JA2 hackers, releasing several editors for the game as well as info on how to hack the game. Probably the most famous of the editors is <b>JA2AIO</b> (All-In-One). Besides programming I am a designer, musician and audio engineer (specializing in mastering).<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/367964/files/20140207001444-studio_photo.jpg?1392306568"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>
<b>So What's The Story?</b><br/></p>
Several years ago I left the scene to pursue other projects, but I could not leave the game alone. About a year ago I wanted to make my own mod based on <b>JA2 1.13</b> using the weapons from <b>Jagged Alliance 1</b>. Decoding the STI format used there was not too much of a problem but when I tried to integrate them into <b>JA2 1.13</b> things became messy and when I tried to edit the interface I ran into more trouble, STI-Edit was just not up to the task anymore. So I began coding a new STI editor.<br/><br/>But that project requires a lot more time than I have available because I am working on my graduation project and need to work to finance my monthly bills and tuition fees. Unfortunately that one job I have doesn't bring in enough, so I need a second one, further limiting my time. Recently I saw the <b>Jagged Alliance: Flashback</b> Kickstarter campaign and was impressed how many people were willing to donate for it. Its successful funding made me wonder if it is possible to get my editor development funded.<br/><br/><p><b><br/></b></p><p>
<b>Why Support An Editor Project?</b><br/></p>It has been more than 10 years since STI-Edit's release. The program is not up to the task anymore (no offense!) since JA2 1.13 boosted the game's resolution, not to mention STI-Edit's buggy behavior on modern operating systems. I can and would love to change that, but developing high-quality software takes a lot of time and that is a luxury I do not have. A successful campaign would give me the necessary financial security to develop a <i>comprehensive</i> editor for JA2's graphics that can replace several of the modder's every day tools. Instead of doing a second job, I could work on the editor while still being able to pay my expenses. It would be more fun for me and a huge benefit for the whole community. And to make it perfectly clear: I am <b>NOT</b> planning to charge for the editor. I want it to be <b>freeware</b> without advertisements, like all the other editors.<br/><br/><p><b><br/></b></p><p>
<b>What You Will Get</b><br/></p>The editor will allow you to view/edit STI files without the need for other programs, all in a neat looking application that is platform independent (only Adobe AIR is required). The list of features depends on the amount of funding, see the following lists for details:<br/><br/><i>500+ €: </i><b>The Basic Editor</b><br/><ul>
<li>Can process all types of STI files (8bit and 16bit, single/multi page, animation).</li>
<li>Can export the current image or the whole sequence contained in the STI.</li>

I want to develop a new STI editor that can replace the old STI-Edit because it is not up to the task anymore. It can not handle the high resolution files introduced in Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 and behaves rather buggy on modern operating systems, plus I want to have more features at my disposal without constantly switching between programs. Unfortunately my personal situation does not allow me to spend much time on the project, a possible release date would most likely be more than 18 months into the future. Assuming I spent all my free time on it, that is.

Who I Am
My name is Tox and I am currently studying Communication & Multimedia Design in the Netherlands. In the past I have spent countless hours hacking Jagged Alliance 2. In 2000 I started the project Lords of the Bytes with two fellow JA2 hackers, releasing several editors for the game as well as info on how to hack the game. Probably the most famous of the editors is JA2AIO (All-In-One). Besides programming I am a designer, musician and audio engineer (specializing in mastering).
So What's The Story?
Several years ago I left the scene to pursue other projects, but I could not leave the game alone. About a year ago I wanted to make my own mod based on JA2 1.13 using the weapons from Jagged Alliance 1. Decoding the STI format used there was not too much of a problem but when I tried to integrate them into JA2 1.13 things became messy and when I tried to edit the interface I ran into more trouble, STI-Edit was just not up to the task anymore. So I began coding a new STI editor.But that project requires a lot more time than I have available because I am working on my graduation project and need to work to finance my monthly bills and tuition fees. Unfortunately that one job I have doesn't bring in enough, so I need a second one, further limiting my time. Recently I saw the Jagged Alliance: Flashback Kickstarter campaign and was impressed how many people were willing to donate for it. Its successful funding made me wonder if it is possible to get my editor development funded.
Why Support An Editor Project?It has been more than 10 years since STI-Edit's release. The program is not up to the task anymore (no offense!) since JA2 1.13 boosted the game's resolution, not to mention STI-Edit's buggy behavior on modern operating systems. I can and would love to change that, but developing high-quality software takes a lot of time and that is a luxury I do not have. A successful campaign would give me the necessary financial security to develop a comprehensive editor for JA2's graphics that can replace several of the modder's every day tools. Instead of doing a second job, I could work on the editor while still being able to pay my expenses. It would be more fun for me and a huge benefit for the whole community. And to make it perfectly clear: I am NOT planning to charge for the editor. I want it to be freeware without advertisements, like all the other editors.
What You Will GetThe editor will allow you to view/edit STI files without the need for other programs, all in a neat looking application that is platform independent (only Adobe AIR is required). The list of features depends on the amount of funding, see the following lists for details:500+ €: The Basic Editor
Can process all types of STI files (8bit and 16bit, single/multi page, animation).

<div>Furthermore, the idea of video games being a focus of academic inquiry is still a very new and somewhat radical idea.

Games are the interactive tales which ensure that we are the heroes.

Your support of my research helps me to get the word out. It helps me to prove to naysayers what we as gamers have known all along: that games are epic interactive tales worthy of serious study.

But don't just take MY word for it--
See what some of my talk attendees had to say about my recent PAX East 2014 panel entitled, ""The Mythology in and of Games"" (which can be viewed in its entirety here: http://youtu.be/WtjAzMj-bIg?t=33m48s   ):
""...[E]ngaging, clever, intelligent, funny, and had a topic that was both crucial and extremely under represented in the selection for panels this year. Of all the panelists I've seen in four consecutive years you were by far the best speaker and had the most inspiring speech. There wasn't a moment during your portion where I wasn't riveted to what you were saying and you put what so many gamers feel about the stories they experience into words like no one else could have. This is going to sound lame but when you talked about how these stories impacted your life, especially during your childhood, I was nearly in tears. I really just need to tell you how much I appreciate what you did and just how amazing it was to me. I just can't stress enough how inspiring you were.""
-Joshua N.

""So, thank you for not only underscoring the importance of narrative to gaming and its culture, but for also presenting the information in such an emotional and lively way. Your passion and enthusiasm was contagious, and it became the highlight of this year’s convention for me.""
-Tom B.

""I just wanted to let you know you did a fantastic job. I couldn't agree more that the future of storytelling lies within video games. You have a very positive energy that I think touched everyone in that room on a deeper level than most speakers. I hope to see your work in the future, and I hope you continue to speak and share your positivity with gamers and anyone who will listen!""
-Kerry S.

""I loved your part of Sunday's panel!  It brought tears to my eyes and made me want to give everyone at PAX a hug.  This was first PAX and many parts of it will be memorable; however, I know that your emotion, your passion, will be the thing I remember most.""
-Andrew U.

  Risks & Challenges Of course, not all people believe that video games are worth anything beyond entertainment. Still others firmly believe that games are a wholly negative influence on people and society.
Furthermore, the idea of video games being a focus of academic inquiry is still a very new and somewhat radical idea. As such, there is still a reluctance to fund projects which research video games, and consequently, it can be very difficult for researchers and graduate students to justify and secure funding with the established funding agencies.
It is for this reason (among others) that I have decided to try this funding experiment out on indiegogo--to see if I can appeal to those who really know games and who believe as I do.
This is admittedly no easy road. But I can assure you that I have the skill, smarts, tenacity, and track record to make sure video games have a strong advocate in academia and beyond.

I've spoken at the following conferences and conventions:
Oct. 2012: Michigan State Univ. Meaningful Play 2012 Conference (Full Paper: ""Establishing Literary Merit in Metal Gear Solid"")
Mar. 2013: Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) Japan (Full Paper: ""On the Frame Narrative of Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War""--note: full text in Japanese)
Apr. 2013: International Conference on Japan Game Studies 2013 (Full Paper: ""Interactive Frame Narrative and Player Evaluation-based Story Evolution in Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War"")
Apr. 2014: PAX East 2014 (Panel speaker: ""The Mythology in and of Games: Why The Legend of Zelda is just as important as the legend of Beowulf"")
Aug. 2014: Replaying Japan 2014 (Full Paper: ""Genetic Predestiny vs. Digital Free Will: A Critical Analysis of Character Foils in Metal Gear Solid"")
(to appear) Oct. 2014: Meaningful Play 2014 (Full Paper: ""Conceptualizing Player-side Emergence in Interactive Games: Between Hardcoded Software and the Human Mind in Papers, Please and Gone Home"")

Players will be able to choose how they participate and what type of game experience they have. Power to the PlayersAs gamers ourselves, we want to make this game for the players. Teams are managed by players who are free to build colonies, expand their alliances, and battle enemies at their own discretion. There are no weapons or equipment restrictions, making the game all about a player's character and custom loadouts. There are no mountains a player can’t climb or doors a player can’t go through. Feel the freedom of being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want.Centerpoint will always be releasing new features, improvements and fixes.  We are  starting with the core game concepts and building towards our grand vision. This allows players to get new updates quickly and not be bored by stagnant content.Community InvolvementIn order for us to build fast and deliver often, we need player participation. Through the “R&D Department,” we’re going to allow players to not only provide feedback but actually participate in game development. By forging their own ideas with the same tools that we use, players can build and submit models to our R&D department. If you can build it and we like it, it goes into the game.We’re building this game on Unity 3D and that means we can put Centerpoint on a ton of devices! Currently, Centerpoint is played right on the web with Unity’s web browser plugin. This allows players on Mac and PC to play together without having to download separate clients. We have plans to roll out builds for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android (OUYA), and eventually consoles like Xbox and Playstation.$15,000 Stretch Goal - VehiclesIf we can reach $15,000 dollars, we would be able to develop a set of vehicles for players to build and use in the game world. This would include both ground and air vehicles, which would allow players to travel faster around the game world. $25,000 Stretch Goal - iOS & Android BuildsOur current plan is to develop Web, PC, Mac and Linux builds. If we blow past our first $15,000 stretch goal, we can begin work on native iOS and Android builds. This would include a special build for iPhone / iPads and Android phones. In addition to phones, we would port the Android build to the OUYA gaming console.Onward and Upward!Thank you so much for taking the time to view our campaign and helping us by investing in our project. We ask that you please share this campaign with your friends and family. Each contribution is a huge step and we cannot meet our goal without each and every one of you. Help us, the Big Room Studios team, support Max and his vision for Centerpoint. Together, we can bring this project from an alpha to a beta version, and Centerpoint can become a viable product to be promoted, supported, and improved by Max, Big Room Studios, and our growing community of players!

<h3>THE PIXELKICK GAMES STORY</h3>
<p><span class=""agText"">My name is Kevin Gunn...I'm the owner of a one man game studio called <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Pixelkick Games</span>!  I've been a programmer/software developer since I was 13, and I've written software for several major companies throughout my career.   I was fortunate enough to be hired by NASA (United Space Alliance), where I realized my childhood dream to be a part of America's space program.  I left NASA in pursuit of higher pay, and never again found the job satisfaction I had abandoned.  Years-and-years of working long hours for thankless companies eventually took its toll on me.  Suffering from ""programmer burn-out"", i resigned from a good paying job as a software developer, and took a job as a desktop support technician.  Finally happy again, I excelled in this role, and was promoted to Lead Technician where i am today.    <br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">Over the past four years I have devoted countless hours of my spare time to creating games for the web and mobile platforms.

<div>
<p>The simple truth is, I'll never stop making games.  The time I spend at it keeps me sharp, and satisfies my need to do something creative.  The sad reality is, without funding, the games I make won't ever go to market, or will, at best get lost in the ocean of all the other great <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">indie games</span> out there.  Too many indie games are passed over and go unseen because of a non-existent promotional budget.  The big name game studios spend money hand-over-fist and grab up all the attention.  <span class=""agText"">The good news is, I have a plan...</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The funding I'm seeking will allow me to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"">• Purchase an upgrade for Multimedia Fusion 2 (the development platform I use)</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The next $150 </span>will go toward the purchase of a used iPod Touch 4th Gen (for game testing).  Testing on this model allows me to ensure that the games play well, even on a device that is not using the latest technology.  At present, I'm testing on my son's iPod Touch, which sadly has a badly damaged screen (he dropped it).  Wrestling it away from him is a difficult task.  It is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">his</span> iPod, after all, and its not really fair for me to deprive him of his favorite ""toy"".   Even If I don't raise more than $400, I'll still have the ability to move forward.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The next $400 </span>will go toward the purchase of a used iPad 2.  The iPad market offers huge potential for games and other apps that I'll continue to develop and promote.  Sure, the next iPad is due to be released in March, but I don't need the latest to get into this market.   I've seen used devices for as little as $365, but the impact will be significant for my games.  As it stands, I can't test on an iPad, so I'm not developing for the iPad, and I'm missing the boat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">All funds raised beyond this</span> will be used to <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">hire a much needed artist</span> who can re-work the sprites* and other art for my games.  I have working prototypes in place that just need the right graphics and they can go to market very quickly.  Additionally, money from this point on will be used to promote my games via the most popular and highest rated promotional websites and other media. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We all loved the graphics and exciting gameplay that the NES/SNES platforms entitled us to when we were younger.  What we as gamers appreciated the most was the extraordinary feeling of accomplishment when we finally managed to beat the final boss, achieve the highest score, or see the ending of a beautiful, pristine story line that allowed our protoganist, whom we played, to come into their own.  Our imaginations ran wild as we stumbled through new levels, found new items, unlocked new revealing secrets, and competed with our friends in these fantasy worlds.  I want to bring that back; the type of gaming that required devotion, imagination, and sometimes just a little pinch of good old fashioned luck, and so Eclipse++ pays homage to those games of old that will forever live in our hearts.</p>
<p><br/>Eclipse++ offers it's users a chance to create expansive worlds using their imaginations and creative expressions, whether it be through alluring visuals or an amazing event driven story.  Unlike consoles during the golden age of gaming Eclipse++ also offers full multiplayer support so that distance never separates or keeps a gamer and their friends, family, or colleagues from joining together in the fantasy world of their choosing.</p>

<p>I am a programmer.  This means that, although I can create the engine, I have been using placeholder graphics from other sources that may or may not be under license for redistribution or commercial use. While the user will inevitably be replacing the graphics to suit their own needs I would like to be able to ship this product with a small base tile set, sprite sheet, and a few high quality sound files. I would also like to have a base GUI designed and set up so that people can jump into the process of creating their works without having the overwhelming need for quality graphics much more readily and quickly.</p>
<p>Having access to a VPS in order to host a demo server is imperative; it is also ideal to allow the user base to play test the engine in a live environment before they decide that it's applicable to their needs, and it is also ideal for bug testing purposes.  A professionally crafted website is also a high priority for me as it would allow concise collection of information that would ultimately act as a repository for future users as the engine progresses.</p>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>My Experience</strong></h2>
<p>You may be wondering where my experience lies and if I have the programming knowledge necessary for this task. I am a student of the Art Institute of Vancouver. I am graduating in less then 3 months and I have taken a great deal away from the experience.  I have attended numerous game jams that have targetted development on the Windows and Android platforms, as well as various current generation consoles.</p>
<p>I have been actively programming and using game development tools for approximately a decade; my experience and knowledge of past and present paradigms, tool sets, and languages lends me a great edge in accomplishing this task.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The engine is free. Why should I help fund it?</h2>
<p>Yes, the engine will be released completely free. When you help fund this project you will be part of something that is not only fun and educational, but an exciting experience in and of itself.  The incentives for funding at or above certain levels allows access to the source code; this allows you to commercialize and freely distribute any derivative works or games made with the works, free of royalties, surcharges, or other compensation; we simply ask for attribution.</p>
<h2>Wait. What about the engine found at that link?</h2>
<p>If you've had the chance to visit our website you may have noticed that it is already the home of a very active gaming community centered around a similar engine. The difference is that the previous engine is created in Visual Basic 6, and as a result has reached the end of it's development. We are finding it increasingly difficult to find developers to aid in contributing to the engine in a quality controlled manner.  Taking into account newer technologies, a proper programming education and a more powerful language, we believe that we can create a better, more powerful, and feature complete engine then ever before that tailors to a larger demographic.</p>

Summary
We all loved the graphics and exciting gameplay that the NES/SNES platforms entitled us to when we were younger.  What we as gamers appreciated the most was the extraordinary feeling of accomplishment when we finally managed to beat the final boss, achieve the highest score, or see the ending of a beautiful, pristine story line that allowed our protoganist, whom we played, to come into their own.  Our imaginations ran wild as we stumbled through new levels, found new items, unlocked new revealing secrets, and competed with our friends in these fantasy worlds.  I want to bring that back; the type of gaming that required devotion, imagination, and sometimes just a little pinch of good old fashioned luck, and so Eclipse++ pays homage to those games of old that will forever live in our hearts.
Eclipse++ offers it's users a chance to create expansive worlds using their imaginations and creative expressions, whether it be through alluring visuals or an amazing event driven story.  Unlike consoles during the golden age of gaming Eclipse++ also offers full multiplayer support so that distance never separates or keeps a gamer and their friends, family, or colleagues from joining together in the fantasy world of their choosing.

<h2>About the Drinking Quest Series</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Jason Anarchy the creator of the Drinking Quest series.  It's a quirky comedy series that finds the perfect blend of Tabletop RPG and Drinking Game.  Drinking Quest: The Original Drinking RPG and Drinking Quest 2: Yeddy Vedder's Yeti Adventure were each genre busting independent hits and this third game will complete the trilogy.</p>
<p>Having game nights and drinking with my friends is one of my favourite things in life. It's something I'm very passionate about.  I've been the perpetual GM my whole life and have made thousands of adventures, always tinged with humour to stay in my comfort zone.  My goal was to capture this very specific style of game night (RPG, Drinking, Quick Witted Comedy) and make it a cult game that stands on it's own in the Tabletop Gaming industry.</p>
<p>I really wanted to make sure that the Drinking Quest games stood on their own as comedy games first beyond the ""Drinking meets RPG"" mechanics.  I've always strived to have additional layers of depth with the story and humour beyond what the players expect.  There is a layer of humour that I would describe as surface level.  Then we have a layer where the player would say ""Hey I didn't notice that before, that's awesome"" and then there is the layer where I really dig deep into my psyche to try and challenge the players perception of themselves and the world.</p>
<p>Also... DRINKING IS FUN!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://drinkingquest.com/images/indiegogo/brawl.jpg"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p>
<p>So here are the many options available to you!</p>
<p>*** Please note that shipping charges need to be added onto the total in most tiers***</p>

<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://drinkingquest.com/images/indiegogo/boxes.jpg"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></h2>
<h2>Stretch Goals:</h2>
<p>$20,000 - Everyone who ordered a physical copy of the game gets a Drinking Quest Fridge Magnet portraying an epic battle scene.  This is not something that simply has a logo slapped on it.</p>
<p>$30,000 - Everyone who ordered a physical copy of the game gets a Drinking Quest Key Chain Bottle Opener.  These are different than the ""What Would Chuglox Do?"" key chains we had going for a while.  It will have some kind of life advice or credo from the game like ""Absolute Power is Awesome"".</p>
<p>$40,000 - Everyone at the $65 level gets a signed picture of the creator's fist. This can be used to intimidate your enemies or just have framed on your desk at work.  We would post a picture but we don't want to break the internet.  This comes in a really stylish plastic frame.</p>
<p>$60,000 - Dice Upgrade - All three games will get a dice upgrade.  It changes from a simple D6 system to a simple D4, D6, D8 system.  It's something we've always wanted to do but just didn't have the budget for it.</p>
<p>A common question that might come up is ""Why not have an expansion or more cards?"".  I don't believe in that model, it's bad for the players.  I want everyone to have a consistently entertaining experience and I didn't want to hold anything back.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://drinkingquest.com/images/indiegogo/covers.jpg"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p>
<h2>What am I funding?</h2>
<p>This would cover the first run of Drinking Quest 3 games and some additional copies of Drinking Quest 1 and 2 (which are nearly sold out).  Not only would this allow the completion of the planned trilogy but also allow the quality to jump from ""Good for an indie game"" to ""It's good for any game"".  With a group funding campaign, everyone who wants a game can get one and with all kinds of great perks! </p>
<p>The quality of boxes will change to hard ""Board Game"" style boxes while keeping the condensed size that is easy to bring to a pub or a friends house. Also we have a colourist on board this time so every card for Drinking Quest 3 will be full colour.  The cards will also increase in size slightly and maintain the same high quality thickness and coating introduced in the second edition Drinking Quest 1 and 2's.</p>
<p>We've also had a lot of requests for t-shirts and extra merch so this gives an option to those hardcore fans.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have some ridiculous types of perks and stretch goals and really turn the group funding paradigm on it's head while also offering several tiers that have a lot of value for backers.</p>

<p>Ancient Kemet the Game is created by two brothers, Dom Tollhotep and Rob AmunRob, who combined their passion for ancient Egypt with an eye for graphics and brain for programming. Not only all the visuals and game style, but even the engine that runs the game was created by us. We added to that our experience with other games and what we would have done differently and what concepts we liked. Ancient Kemet is a creation of passion and fascination, because all the aspects of this project are something we both are passionate about and fascinated by.</p>

<p>To make Ancient Kemet alive, we have split the project into three stages:<br/>1) Alpha testing stage<br/>2) Beta testing stage<br/>3) Ancient Kemet version 1.0</p>
<p>In this Indiegogo campaing we would like to <strong>raise funding for alpha testing</strong>, which we want to execute in May. Based on all the feedback we get, we want Beta testing up shortly after and then rinse and repeat, Ancient Kemet full version goes live.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Alpha Testing Stage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ancientkemet.net/wp-content/themes/ancientkemet/images/indiegogo/at.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Alpha Testing Stage""/></h2>
<p>For alpha testing stage we want to raise 4 000 EUR to cover our cost for graphics, development, software licenses, sound production and of course, servers. On top of that we would like to get like-minded players fascinated with Ancient Egypt in for the actual testing to help us with their feedback, their ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Let's have a quick overview of the alpha testing scenario</strong></p>
<p>Alpha testing will be based on the scenario of <strong>2 nomes</strong>, each with a town with its own ground reserved for gathering resources for basic professions. In between the nomes there will be a <strong>free PVP combat zone</strong>, where players will find more expensive resources.</p>
<p>There are going to be several character <strong>professions</strong> in the final version of the game, for aplha testing we picked four: farming, blacksmithing, crafting and fishing. These will be the basic means for getting on your feet with gaining extra gear and materials you need.</p>
<p>On top of that, at the end of the combat zone players will find a mystical <strong>Temple of Resurrection</strong>, where our innovative concept of raiding is to be tested.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ancient Kemet Scenery"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ancientkemet.net/wp-content/themes/ancientkemet/images/indiegogo/dev-log_14.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Temple of Resurrection – New raid concept</h3>
<p>In alpha stage there will be one major PVP raid which will lead into the Temple of Resurrection. After conquering the enemy team from the other nome you will gain access to an <strong>ancient artefact</strong>, that will grant you enourmous power and transform you into the dark servants of Seth. It will be your role to hold the temple against enemy and shall you succeed, you will be rewarded greatly.</p>
<p>If you happen to loose the fight for the artefact, your chance comes in defeating the monsters in the temple itself, who are in fact, players from the other nome.</p>

In alpha stage there will be one major PVP raid which will lead into the Temple of Resurrection. After conquering the enemy team from the other nome you will gain access to an ancient artefact, that will grant you enourmous power and transform you into the dark servants of Seth. It will be your role to hold the temple against enemy and shall you succeed, you will be rewarded greatly.
If you happen to loose the fight for the artefact, your chance comes in defeating the monsters in the temple itself, who are in fact, players from the other nome.
The most important thing from alpha testing stage?Your feedback :)

We are very grateful for all your contributions and we will keep you posted with all news from Ancient Kemet through our campaing here on Indiegogo, on our website and on Facebook as well.
All the rewards are connected with the game itself and whether you wish to play in the later stages after more content has been added or you want to jump in as a game moderator straight away, there are contribution options for all. The spaces for alpha testing are limited though.
Thank you
Thank you for your time, your interest and your support. If you have a question, want to drop us a line or would like to stay up to date, follow us on Facebook or check out our Ancient Kemet website.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We began our series as a way to teach and play board games with on-line viewers over YouTube.  Many modern games have long rule books and can be quite expensive.  Our series allows a viewer to learn the game and see it played, which we believe is one of the best ways to see if a game is right for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This process has been a lot of fun for us, and our viewers seem to be enjoying it as well, so we really want to be able to do this on a full time basis, which can be hard in the early days with no sponsors.  Although we have 1,600 subscribers and over 150,000 views on our channel, we are still in the early stages of growth, but we hope the quick growth of the series over the past few months indicates that we have something that will be of interest to a wider audience.  We're especially hoping some early financial assistance during this year will pay off into a self-sustaining video series.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Realistically, I need to raise $20,000 to cover my income for the year, however, this is a hefty goal, and instead this fund raiser is being set for $5,000, representing the cost to fund a quarter of the year, with the hope that if more money can be raised, we can continue producing the series longer before having to reassess.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In particular, if we can grow the series over the next few months, then any future fund raising will be spread over more viewers, easing the burden and we may be able to attract the financial support of retailers or board game publishers who would like to be featured in our series.</p>

<br/><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><i>The Dream King</i> plays in a non-linear ""<i>Metroidvania</i>""
 style, where the
 player must navigate throughout a large world in order to find 
artifacts, weapons and abilities so that they can advance to other 
areas. It also combines elements from other genres such as vert-shooters
 with ""bullet hell"" or ""curtain fire"" gameplay!<br/><br/>There will be an enormous cast of over 20 playable characters,  each one being unique in how they help support the team in reaching the goal! A great amount of teamwork
 can be used to reach new areas, and the right combinations of 
characters and skill sets can be used to the teams advantage! The game will 
also feature a Versus Mode in which the players can battle one another and test out their skills!<br/><br/>Also, just like in the popular game Final Fantasy VII, Endica VII will have fun mini-games available
 within the main quest. These mini-games will be the dreams that the 
players have throughout the game, and can later on be accessible at any 
given time for even more 4-player excitement! Some of the 
mini-games aren't so mini, a few of them even resemble some other famous
 titles, for example a mini-game that largely resembles Bomberman!</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><b><br/><br/><br/></b><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/96029/files/20130925153202-Screenshot101.png?1380148322"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>

The Dream King
 is a unique blend of multiple genres into one Side 
Scrolling Action Role Playing Game!  It is intended to capture the magic
 of the childhood classics of the early 80's and 90's gaming era!The Dream King will be available on Windows, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Ouya, and hopefully Steam and Gamestick in 2014!

 The game will immerse the player in a high fantasy world with a wide range of  developed characters and story! It is being produced for multiple platforms (including PC, Steam, Ouya, Gamestick, Android, and Iphone) and it is scheduled to be released in 2014. It offers the player an immense world to explore with a compelling cast and plot! The game features elements from other classic games such as Mega Man, Final Fantasy, and Castlevania, but it will also feature Street Fighter moves and local cooperative and versus gameplay!



The Dream King plays in a non-linear ""Metroidvania""
 style, where the
 player must navigate throughout a large world in order to find 
artifacts, weapons and abilities so that they can advance to other 
areas. It also combines elements from other genres such as vert-shooters
 with ""bullet hell"" or ""curtain fire"" gameplay!There will be an enormous cast of over 20 playable characters,  each one being unique in how they help support the team in reaching the goal! A great amount of teamwork
 can be used to reach new areas, and the right combinations of 
characters and skill sets can be used to the teams advantage! The game will

given time for even more 4-player excitement! Some of the 
mini-games aren't so mini, a few of them even resemble some other famous
 titles, for example a mini-game that largely resembles Bomberman!



Although the characters and story 
are a high priority during development, the quality of gameplay has already been well
established! The engine is being created using my ""Mega Man Perfect Harmony"" fan game!Footage from my separate 4-Player Mega Man Fan Game.As
 mentioned before, the game combines the best elements from a broad 
range of genres to create a perfect mixture of entertainment. It plays 
almost as if it were a Mega Man game, with action, platforming, and quick reflexes being a big part of it. However it also plays like a Final Fantasy

Hemos inventado Dudek para vosotros:



""Busca el símbolo que se repite el número de veces indicado en el mazo, ¿serás el más rápido?"".

¡Compacto y fácil de llevar!



¡60 cartas diferentes!


¡Educativo!






¡Entre amigos!





Ejemplo de carta:





¿Por qué Dudek?.
El juego se compone de 60 cartas, todas diferentes, con 20 símbolos en cada una de ellas. En el envés de cada carta irán apareciendo de manera aleatoria el número 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.   
Buscamos un nombre sencillo, que hiciera alusión a una característica que se repitiera en todas las cartas.
Dudek es la traducción en ""Esperanto"" de 20 (los 20 símbolos que aparecen en cada carta).
