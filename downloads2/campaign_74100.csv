<h3>Welcome to Ten Restaurant. </h3>
<p>Why Ten? With this restaurant we want to boil fine dining to it's core; providing great food and amazing hospitality. Concentrating on fewer people a night and instead focussing on the quality of each guest's experience, we believe that will we be a needed addition to Canada's food scene. The menu is vegetable forward showcasing the amazing products we have here in Ontario.</p>
<p>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541955415/mq1jdxxc4z4ts1mmksvx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This restaurant is the dream of 24 year old Chef/Owner Julian Bentivegna. Up until now he had been working in some of North America and Europe's best restaurants and earlier this year he decided that it was time to go on his own. He felt that his age could offer a fresh take on fine dining that is needed. Having someone as passionate as he is at the helm means that this is more than just a restaurant, this will be a home.</p>
<p>What makes us different is not only how few people we plan to serve a night but how we plan on running our restaurant. We believe in paying our employees a liveable wage and not working them to their early graves. If we take good care of our staff, they in turn will take good care of our guests. Once we open, we will also be working with organizations that deal with food insecurity in Toronto. We want to create a model that utilizes our unused food product to tackle hunger in our community. Ideally, we want to see hunger eradicated in Canada in our lifetime.</p>
<p>In the end, fine dining is about creating a space where you can concentrate on every single detail of a guest's night. We take this attention to detail to heart in everything Ten does. We are just shy of the final amount needed to complete construction which is why we have launched this campaign. </p>
<p>The magnitude of what your support means to us is unparalleled and is something we will strive to pay back every single day we are open. We don't have any deep pocketed investors so any amount pledged is monumental.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are so close to opening! However we still need to raise a bit more funding to get the restaurant up and running. </p>
<p>The 10 000 goal will be spent on the last bit of leasehold improvements needed to be made to our space. This includes everything from chairs and lighting to millworking and plumbing.</p>
<h3>&amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541955636/nijozgkjmhbelq1fgk94.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want to show you how much we value your support! To get you excited about our opening, any amount that you pledge between 50 and 2000 will be rewarded with a e-gift card for 50% that amount on top of previous perks. The perks range from shout outs and signed menus/merch to dinners and special events. If you pledge more than 2000 we will basically consider you a god and the restaurant is yours for any night of your choosing once we open. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This restaurant aims to not only be valuable to pushing Toronto's food scene forward but we will be working to make a positive difference in our community. We believe in the power of food, wine and hospitality to change the world for the better. </p>
<p>This summer and fall we have been putting on a series of successful pop-ups out of different locations around the city. We have used these as a great way to R&amp;D our menu as well as introduce the public to our food. The fun atmosphere of the pop-ups will be translated into our eventual space. We take what we do very seriously, however we are doing this because we love this industry so we are creating a strictly no-ego workplace.</p>

<p>Ten is meant to be about a fine dining restaurant built and supported by it's surrounding community. Building a restaurant of this caliber is expensive and we have faced and overcome every hurdle that has been laid before us so far. Now we are in the home stretch and can't wait to be able to start hosting people. Let's make this happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks when you’re talking about restaurants. It's expensive, there are low profit margins and it's a lot of hard work. That said, most restaurants fail because they don't understand the industry or miss the mark on their concept and business model. We have done everything possible to overcome these obstacles, including raising the majority of our funds already.</p>
<p>We have also worked relentlessly with industry leaders to create a business model that allows us to stay profitable with only 10 seats a night. This model borrows from high-end Japanese chef counter/table restaurants. Even if this campaign does not reach its goal we will still open, although it might just take a bit longer. Quitting isn't in our vocabulary and we know that this restaurant will be an exciting and valuable addition to Toronto's food scene.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you would like to support our campaign but can't afford to contribute right now please share this campaign on social media and tell your friends about our opening! We appreciate all the help we can get.</p>

Cupcakes by Tish is the vision of owner / executive pastry chef, Tish Leonard & has quickly become THE leading destination for gourmet cupcakes in the River Region. Tish & Quincy are co-owners of the award-winning cupcake shop, which opened its original location in Old Cloverdale in December of 2011. After the first year of serving Montgomery’s Midtown community, an overwhelming demand prompted us to open our second Cupcakes by Tish location in East Montgomery. Since then we have added a location on Maxwell Air Force Base & added the ""Tish Mobile"", our popular cupcake truck.
Our menu offers over 100 different cupcake flavors to choose from, including Tish’s Signature Red Velvet, as well as unique flavors such as Chocolate Pomegranate, S’mores, Sweet Potato, & her award-winning original “Cheesecake Cupcake” line.



We are passionate about our product & want to share its deliciousness with the world. Our goal is to successfully bring our award-winning cheesecake cupcakes, sauces, & syrups into homes across the United States!






   What We Need & What You Get

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We are <i>Spreading Pawsitivity, </i>a student group at the University of Tennessee Knoxville advocating on behalf of Little Ponderosa Zoo and Rescue in order to build and maintain habitats for exotic animals. As members of <i>Spreading Pawsitivity</i>, we are excited to support a local rescue in order to provide a loving home for beautiful, innocent animals that do not have anywhere else to go.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Each of the animals placed at Little Ponderosa have had their own story pertaining to hardship and triumph. Thanks to their zoo and rescue, our furry friends have been given a forever home where not only the workers can show their compassion, but the surrounding Anderson and Knox counties as well.</p>
<h3>Why Do I Matter?</h3>
<p>In order to provide homes for the many exotic animals (including camels, kangaroos, foxes,  monkeys, zebra, and many more) they need specific habitats to be built. These habitats are extremely expensive and can range anywhere form $10,000 to $50,000 to construct and maintain. The money that you donate will go directly toward building these enclosures for the rescued animals of Little Ponderosa. We cannot give these animals homes without you!</p>
<h3>What is the Little Ponderosa Zoo and Rescue?</h3>
<p>The Little Ponderosa Zoo and Rescue is a a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that is located in Clinton, Tennessee. What started originally as a zoo soon also became a rescue as people were soon asking for them to take in their exotic pets. Over the years, Little Ponderosa soon grew to have a population of animals that are 98% rescues!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the main challenges that we face is showing people why they should care about a small town zoo when compared to a larger one, such as Zoo Knoxville. After all, wouldn't a larger zoo be more qualified in the care and housing of rescues than Little Ponderosa? The recent renovation of their fox habitat has demonstrated that they are more than capable in caring for their beautiful exotic animals, and, more than anything, Little Ponderosa's enthusiasm and dedication is like no other. Despite the devastation and heartbreak they have experienced over the years, this non-profit is fully committed to saving animals, one rescue at a time. </p>

<h2><strong>LET’S MAKE THIS TOGETHER! HELP US TO RISE! </strong></h2> <p>We are an imports shop, we want to import any product from anywhere in the world to Colombia and sell it at an affordable price with an excellent service. As an aggregate we believe that through what we do not only can change our future and of our decendents, but also of the people who will be our employees changing their perspective about life showing them their potential to grow and change their family and social environment with work and effort.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497294415/z37syzf16ydyailr2bb2.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Why an imports company?</strong></h3>
<p>It's one of the things we do best. It is profitable for all, employees, customers, suppliers and us. We want to leave a better future for the ours, but at the same time the added value of which we speak is that, just as someone can be kind, tolerant, enterprising and efficient in your work with your clients for money, also can be it out of work with their family, With their neighbor, with people on the street AND IN THE TRAFFIC JAM without waiting for something in return. It is clear that we want our family business to grow, we have to see for our owns, but with this we also intend to give something more to the lives of others, something that gives them expectations of a truly better life. We do not currently have employees, but we know that when we grow up we will have to hire them and we don't want them to simply come to work to make money, but also to improve as parents, neighbors, children, spouses and citizens. We don't say this by posing as morally perfect, we are not perfect, we have mistakes, but we believe in the love, loving others, is a decision that we all can take, also the tolerance, to make with your neighbor as you would like they to do with you. These are things that we want to continue strengthening in us at the same time that we teach to those around us. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3><strong>Why do we feel this responsibility?</strong></h3>
<p>Because we are in Colombia, an extremely beautiful country, but plundered by bad policies, besides we have only to look at reality, about 30 Colombians are killed every day, that is, a murder every hour and a half; last year 248 people were injured daily in quarrels and 328 complaints of domestic violence daily. A lot intolerance and lack of love against which we are willing to give our seed.<br/>The global change is in each person and how it relates to those around him, so while we work for our people, we want those who are linked to us (employees, suppliers and customers) to acquire something positive that is not just money or a discount.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Which are our obstacles to get bigger?</strong></h2>
<p>There are several obstacles. Mainly we want to grow and survive as family business, but because of the following things this wish is pretty difficult.</p>
<p>We started with $ 500, thanks to some friends and mostly to banks we have reached a working capital of $ 10,000, but the problem is that we must pay quotas and interest of that money every month, so it is not a 100% of capital of our own. Therefore reinvest is complex. We want to invest the 100% of the funds of this campaign, then, with the earnings we will kill the bank bills!</p>
<p>The second problem is that our growth has been very limited because with that money the products we can buy are very few, about 40 kinds of products, therefore, we reach very little public and we constantly sell almost the 90% of the products while the rest of the cargo arrives in the country, then sometimes we have lasted almost 1 week without selling anything. Because the lack of variety.</p>
<p>The third problem is totally proportional to the two previous ones, and is that we want to change the way that we use to bring the merchandise worldwide. We currently bring the goods by air, but it is extremely expensive! It's crazy! In addition, the weight we can handle at the moment is 40kg aprox, which makes the shipping cost even greater because between more weight, cheaper cost per pound. By sea the costs in general are very low, but the ""minimum load"" by sea is 1.2 tons or 1 cubic meter, to achieve this one must buy a lot more merchandise, and that represents money that we do not have...</p>
<p>Also over the merchandise, transport and insurance (CIF) we must pay several taxes that the Colombian government charges us for the importation of the merchandise, VAT or VAT is 19% and tariffs range from 5% to 50%.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497980826/xpgiegcg0wknbhf4dedy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>More than problems, they are goals that we have identified and we want to achieve in order to reach what we want. We know that if we solve all this things to make a investment capital and enough merchandise, we will not only be able to survive as a family business, but we will also be able to fulfill our added value, employ many people and contribute to change their future. About debts, we plan to pay them off with reinvestment proceeds, the ideal is to invest 100% of the money we get through this campaign.</p>
<h2>
<br/><strong>What we need?</strong>
</h2>
<p>Simple! Your collaboration! Any amount, $ 1 or $ 1000 makes a difference. We believe in the power of agreement and union. With your donation you will really mark our life until the last day of our lives and it will spread to all who surround us now and in the future! We are enterprising and workers. We know that this opportunity should be handled with great intelligence and wisdom and we can not waste it. Give us your vote of confidence and believe us, just as we believe in you. Let's do this together!</p>
<h2>
<br/>Are $ 100,000 sufficient to finance the entire company?</h2>
<p>Of course not! With this amount we can cover the initial expenses to take the first step to becoming a relevant importing company spreading a pretty positive influence in each actor of the family and society. The $ 100,000 will allow us to bring our cargo by sea occupying 35% of space approximately in a 20GP container, expand our range of products, decrease costs of taxes, fees and shipping cost. Make a good investment to reach a healthy level of development and competence for the company. Once we reach this, will be able to help much more people with the philosophy that drives us, we want to focus mainly in our employees.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>Here are the perks!</strong></h2>
<p>Of course! This is the list of benefits, but you know that the greatest will be to know that you helped us change our future, that of our generations and that of the people who will work with us. We know that we will make a change with you! The perks won't be things that we import to our country, because are goods that you maybe could find in your country. But we want to give you something unique of us! Parts of us and our country!</p>

<li>Second to reinvest in new products to further open the market.<br/> </li>

We know that if we solve all this things to make a investment capital and enough merchandise, we will not only be able to survive as a family business, but we will also be able to fulfill our added value, employ many people and contribute to change their future. About debts, we plan to pay them off with reinvestment proceeds, the ideal is to invest 100% of the money we get through this campaign.

What we need?

Simple! Your collaboration! Any amount, $ 1 or $ 1000 makes a difference. We believe in the power of agreement and union. With your donation you will really mark our life until the last day of our lives and it will spread to all who surround us now and in the future! We are enterprising and workers. We know that this opportunity should be handled with great intelligence and wisdom and we can not waste it. Give us your vote of confidence and believe us, just as we believe in you. Let's do this together!

Are $ 100,000 sufficient to finance the entire company?
Of course not! With this amount we can cover the initial expenses to take the first step to becoming a relevant importing company spreading a pretty positive influence in each actor of the family and society. The $ 100,000 will allow us to bring our cargo by sea occupying 35% of space approximately in a 20GP container, expand our range of products, decrease costs of taxes, fees and shipping cost. Make a good investment to reach a healthy level of development and competence for the company. Once we reach this, will be able to help much more people with the philosophy that drives us, we want to focus mainly in our employees.
 

Here are the perks!
Of course! This is the list of benefits, but you know that the greatest will be to know that you helped us change our future, that of our generations and that of the people who will work with us. We know that we will make a change with you! The perks won't be things that we import to our country, because are goods that you maybe could find in your country. But we want to give you something unique of us! Parts of us and our country!

 
Once the goal is reached, we will make weekly updates of the progress of the project, both the obstacles we will overcome and the absolute victories!
 
Perks shipping!


When does shipping starts? November 2017. 

When can I expect it to arrive to my home? December 2017 - January 2018. 

To where we send the perks? Worldwide! But it depends of the customs house imports laws of the destination country. 

Customs house tafiffs and VAT: Please ask to he customs house of your country which are the tariffs that can be charged for the import of the goods to your country (if apply, you pay that cost).

 
Where do the funds go if we do not complete the overall goal?

First to pay the banks the credit amounts. We want to be free of bank interest and monthly installments. 
Second to reinvest in new products to further open the market. 
If it is not possible to raise enough money to buy 1.2 tons of merchandise, we will negotiate with the sea shipping company to handle an acceptable rate for less weight.
  Also you can help us to rise making this! 1. Donate funds to the cause.

This is where Vandal Beer comes in. With every purchase of Vandal Beer, we will donate a percentage of the proceeds into two different funds.

<h3>Project 917</h3>
<p>Project 917 is all about our passion for the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">most famous race in motorsport, Le Mans. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This amazing race </span>attracts<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> huge global audiences today but for us it is </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> past history of </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> cars and drivers that evokes our passion and ultimately our dream to bring to life a recreation version of the iconic </span>Porsche 917.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I've been fascinated by just how brave and skilled drivers were to race at Le Mans and no more astounding as the time of the early 1970's which saw the Porsche 917 scream along the Mulsanne at 239 mph, simply amazing.</span></p>
</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444468223/fg9igdm25cs5hzupzrdn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>

</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What we </span>also<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>want<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to achieve is to re-imagine </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> 917 into a modern </span>contemporary<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> version, unique and not just a </span>facsimile<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of the original, something like this...</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So realising a dream to build a contemporary version of the Porsche 917 is phenomenal but this project will also nurture engineering talent and help smart young engineers of the future. There is something very special </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">about</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> providing an </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">opportunity to engage with young talent eager to learn and benefit from a unique project like this especially as the UK is seeing fewer young people enter the field of engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">At </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> heart of Project 917 and during each step of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> process </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">from funding to build completion, we will engage young talent to develop and learn from our team who will coach, develop and help find the engineers of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On-line competitions will be </span>launched<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> during </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> build process to ignite a spark and locate the engineers who will be part of </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> team and instrumental in how it is completed. </span></p>
<p>Additionally, the whole project will be documented as part of a socially focused e-learning portal (917 e-Portal) dedicated to help keen engineers to learn from the project but also from investors and people interested in seeing how the project is progressing. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>The juice for us at Project 917 will be the engagement with young talented people but with an additional benefit of seeing a fantastic and unique road car come to life... does that sound like a cool idea?</p>
<p>So, if you, like us are a fan of Le Mans, motorsport, Porsche 917 or like the idea of helping the young engineering talent of the future or maybe you just want to grab some unique and collectable rewards, then go ahead and invest....</p>

<p>The funds will also be used for the Bill Of Materials, parts, components, engine etc. as well as the creation of the '917 e-Portal' the e-learning element plus an e-commerce sister website that will provide sales of Le Mans and 917 related products.</p>
<p>So of course, the majority of the funding will go to support the component needs of the project with the pricing applied to the overall costs being over estimated as we anticipate that some components will be lower cost, but also gratis as the project will showcase manufacturers and suppliers, benefiting all.</p>
<p>The project will likely take 9-10 months to complete before we can showcase the car and prepare for its sale. This will give us ample time to build a credible vehicle but also ensure that the experience of our engineering stars will be maximised.</p>
<p>The project will therefore have assets that could be sold on should the project fall way short of its objective, but the momentum will be supplemented with the e-commerce sales.</p>
<p><b>Our Perks</b></p>
<p>Our perks are really cool and have been selected to showcase highly creative and desirable and collectable Le Mans and Porsche 917 related gifts and products.</p>
<p>Superb 1:18 and 1:8 Porsche 917 Scale models, stunning 917 framed photographs, unique sculptures, promotional watches all unique and some with signatures of Le Mans racing hero's.</p>

<p>Helping us raise the funding to build Project 917 will also ensure that young talent can use the experience to promote there skills portfolio to help them get a great job or inspire them to build their own business. Project 917 will help the engineering entrepreneurial stars of the future!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will set up competitions to design the interior and exterior trims re-imagining the 917 for a contemporary version, like nothing before!</p>
<p>Winners will be invited to be part of the build process but ultimately we will seek 2-3 talented passionate engineers to join the team. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our mentors will encourage this new team to excel in all aspects of the build creating a unique exposure to skilled technicians and a motivated team.</span></p>
<p>The ultimate goal is on completing the build of 917 that we repeat the exercise when the 917 chassis #1 is sold and secure an agency agreement with Bailey Cars to sell and build cars to order.</p>
<p>This whole exercise will be documented and promoted online via a unique update and e-learning portal (917 e-Portal) so that we can showcase the skills we have but also build a fun creative environment to excite people into engineering and just maybe encouraging the next world renowned engineer!

<p>So how fast will Project917 be? Well, for us the ultimate speed is not so important as creating a contemporary road going version that can be shown off on the streets, as well as a race track. The target weight will be below 1000kg using a Porsche 993 normally aspirated engine rated at 280bhp so she should be quick! </p>
<p>The interior will be snug, but we will bring some touches that will make the driving experience exciting and comfortable.</p>
<p>The exterior shape will be largely unchanged, however we will incorporate unique styling trims to make the 917 stand out in a crowd... all to be designed and imagined by our competition winners!</p>
<p>The finished car will be a result of professional build skills, creative styling and an eye for detail and ultimately a very desirable car for a new owner.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have got this far in reading the campaign, then I would suggest that you might have been inspired to help, and that is awesome and it would be great to have you as part of the success.</p>
<p>Any level of help either via the perks, or indeed just spreading the word would be so helpful indeed, if you are an engineer who would love to be part of the competition then keep following our progress on Indiegogo share tools as well as social media so that you don't miss out.</p>
<p>By joining our journey you will be helping us realise a dream to bring to like one of the iconic shapes in motorsport, but also to help boost young engineers to build experience, confidence and entreprenerial-ship. </p>
<p>This is so exciting, lets all be part of it!</p>
</div></div>","Project 917
Project 917 is all about our passion for the most famous race in motorsport, Le Mans. 
This amazing race attracts huge global audiences today but for us it is the past history of the cars and drivers that evokes our passion and ultimately our dream to bring to life a recreation version of the iconic Porsche 917. 
I've been fascinated by just how brave and skilled drivers were to race at Le Mans and no more astounding as the time of the early 1970's which saw the Porsche 917 scream along the Mulsanne at 239 mph, simply amazing.

We have brought a team together who are not only passionate about this project but who have the experience, skills and knowledge to help ensure this project can be realised. Building the car is not enough and so what will provide fuel and energy to project 917 is our desire to inspire and encourage young engineers and designers to get involved directly with the project.

What we also want to achieve is to re-imagine the 917 into a modern contemporary version, unique and not just a facsimile of the original, something like this...
 

So realising a dream to build a contemporary version of the Porsche 917 is phenomenal but this project will also nurture engineering talent and help smart young engineers of the future. There is something very special about providing an opportunity to engage with young talent eager to learn and benefit from a unique project like this especially as the UK is seeing fewer young people enter the field of engineering.
At the heart of Project 917 and during each step of the process from funding to build completion, we will engage young talent to develop and learn from our team who will coach, develop and help find the engineers of the future.
On-line competitions will be launched during the build process to ignite a spark and locate the engineers who will be part of the team and instrumental in how it is completed. 
Additionally, the whole project will be documented as part of a socially focused e-learning portal (917 e-Portal) dedicated to help keen engineers to learn from the project but also from investors and people interested in seeing how the project is progressing. 
 
Video updates and skills Tutorials on the ePortal by Puddl.We will include young creative people to help provide the content and feel of the portal which will help them create portfolio pieces and will be accompanied by contributions from mentors and special guests presenters.
The juice for us at Project 917 will be the engagement with young talented people but with an additional benefit of seeing a fantastic and unique road car come to life... does that sound like a cool idea?
So, if you, like us are a fan of Le Mans, motorsport, Porsche 917 or like the idea of helping the young engineering talent of the future or maybe you just want to grab some unique and collectable rewards, then go ahead and invest....
What We Need & What You Get

To achieve our goals we need your help in raising £50,000 to purchase the chassis and body of the 917 from Bailey Cars, this will be built to order and delivered to us in Coventry where Advanced Manufacturing will provide a stunning facility for us to work in.
 
 

Example chassis and body from Bailey Cars.
 
 

The team at Bailey cars have years of experience and have shipped 15 917's for customers around the world.

ADV in Coventry, home for Project 917 when the chassis and body arrive from Bailey..
The funds will also be used for the Bill Of Materials, parts, components, engine etc. as well as the creation of the '917 e-Portal' the e-learning element plus an e-commerce sister website that will provide sales of Le Mans and 917 related products.
So of course, the majority of the funding will go to support the component needs of the project with the pricing applied to the overall costs being over estimated as we anticipate that some components will be lower cost, but also gratis as the project will showcase manufacturers and suppliers, benefiting all.
The project will likely take 9-10 months to complete before we can showcase the car and prepare for its sale. This will give us ample time to build a credible vehicle but also ensure that the experience of our engineering stars will be maximised.
The project will therefore have assets that could be sold on should the project fall way short of its objective, but the momentum will be supplemented with the e-commerce sales.
Our Perks
Our perks are really cool and have been selected to showcase highly creative and desirable and collectable Le Mans and Porsche 917 related gifts and products.
Superb 1:18 and 1:8 Porsche 917 Scale models, stunning 917 framed photographs, unique sculptures, promotional watches all unique and some with signatures of Le Mans racing hero's.

<p>I have a passion for gardening but I am stuck in the corporate world. I grew
up with a large family garden and even today hobby farm to supplement my life. I have shared the surplus produce with neighbors
and coworkers and canned for future use. 
I also teach friends and co-workers how to can and dehydrate foods.</p>
<p>I have spent my life living from paycheck to paycheck in jobs that offer me
a wage but no personal satisfaction or purpose; I just exist/survive.  I want to live my dream and help society
become aware of permaculture farming and provide organic produce to the
community, not just existing within my community but actually contributing with
purpose, on purpose.  I would love leave
the corporate world (allowing a young, college graduate a corporate job
opportunity with my vacancy) and fulfill my dream of a permaculture organic farm
with a Bed &amp; Breakfast! </p>
<p>What is Permaculture? Permaculture is
consciously designed landscapes that mimic the patterns and relationships found
in nature while yielding an abundance of food, fiber and energy for provision
of local needs. People, their buildings and the ways in which they organize
themselves are central to permaculture. Thus the permaculture vision of
permanent or sustainable agriculture has evolved to one of permanent or
sustainable culture. </p>
<p>I am not alone in this desire; my
son has struggled through school, graduated with the help of special education
resources, attempted college to find that it was not a direction to his future
success unless he burdens himself with more student loan debt than he will ever
be able to payoff. He knows he wants to farm - he has spent his life in the
garden with me and he has a passion for growing and cultivating crops. He wants
a sustainable life, and he wants to be self-sufficient. </p>
<p>And my daughter, currently a single
working mom and award winning manager with a passion for people and adventure, she
would thrive managing the B&amp;B, partnering with local businesses to
introduce people to all North Alabama has to offer, from organic produce, local
creameries, and bakeries, to vineyards and museums.<span>  And her son would benefit from being part of
a hard working family, sharing in the community and learning the family business.</span></p>
<p>Raising my children in survival mode
is not enough. Just existing doesn’t matter. What I desire the most is
providing a way for my children to be a successful, self–sufficient, satisfied,
contributing members to the community in areas they have passion for. I want
this for me as well - to work for satisfaction, contribution, passion, and
purpose. And this farm would a personal growth opportunity for my family, for my
son, this is how he can overcome his challenges in the workforce, for my
daughter a way too work within her passion and teach her son valuable life
skills.<span>  However, we don’t have the means
to do it; even if we sold everything we would come up short… very, very
short.  What we have is the drive, desire,
ambition, will, tenacity, and perseverance; we just don’t have the funds. </span></p>
<p>Your contributions will help to:</p>

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Train young urban food growers by providing learning
opportunities and help to support the urban permaculture movement</p>
<p><span>·<span>

<p>Coffee! The
wonderful beverage that has been among us for centuries. We love coffee and we
think it deserves better. </p>
<p>As Argea,
our primary job is project-based machine manufacturing (<a href=""www.argea.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.argea.co</a>). But we also have a desire to make
our projects in different fields such as Meliya Coffee real.</p>
<p>Innovation
is the most important value that keeps us vigorous in our different projects.
Innovation enables us to rediscover things and it opens new roads to us.
However, <b>innovation sometimes can damage a natural thing and turn it into
something else.</b></p>
<p>In fact,
what we want to do is be on the natural one’s side as long as technology
enables us to do. It is possible to bring together innovative, natural and
modern products in one product. We want to achieve these goals with Meliya
Coffee. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Natural, pure, long-lasting and shaped Turkish coffee.</b><br/></p>
<p>Turkish
coffee is especially one of the rare products which remained natural and pure in
the field of beverages. Although there is instant coffee or instant Turkish coffee
on the market, we were able to produce a new type of coffee that is as functional
as them and also served natural and pure.</p>
<p>What you

bean.</b> <span>The amount of coffee you use when making coffee
is at a guess. It might cause differences in the taste of coffee. With these

<p>For one cup
of coffee, you put a tablet of Meliya into a coffeepot and cook it at a low
heat until it has a thick foam. (125 ml / 7 gr coffee) Natural, pure,
long-lasting and shaped Turkish coffee.</p>
<p>As Meliya

<p>Arabica is
medium-roasted and finely ground Turkish coffee. If we grow and develop our

coffee and even 3-in-1 coffee in a natural way. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What did we do?</b></p>
<p>The
idea of Meliya Coffee came out in January, 2014. In June, we executed our
prototype manufacturing. <b>We tested our coffee for 6 months.</b> We got excellent
outcomes. </p>
<p>In
a technical sense, we have done our work about manufacturing method, packaging
choice and manufacturing site. At this stage, we need your support. We want to
put Meliya on the market at the same price as its counterparts. </p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I’m Gary, and this summer I worked alongside Ulli and Mark, and together we set to understand changing consumer preferences in the alcoholic drink space.  </p>
<p>Through 40 in-person interviews and a global survey of over 200 people, we discovered that millennials have a very specific idea of what they want in their ideal alcoholic beverage: it means low-cal, it means low-sugar, and natural ingredients.</p>
<p>We’ve brewed up a new, lighter, full-alcohol alternative: Agaté.</p>
<p>Brewed from just three simple ingredients - tea, water, and agave - Agaté is naturally gluten-free, and only has 100 calories and 5g of sugar per serving.</p>
<p>At 4.5% ABV, Agaté offers all of the social benefits of existing alcoholic beverages with significantly fewer calories, the health benefits of tea, and a crisp and refreshing taste.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We’re looking to raise $35,000 so we can produce (called “co-packing” in the biz) our first commercial-sized production run to bring this drink to the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since Agaté is literally designed to share (both in its 6-pack and 750mL format), all sponsorship will include Agaté for you to try!</li>
<li>Unfortunately, since we cannot execute the production run without all of the funds, we can only commit to the run if we make our goal; otherwise, your funds will be returned to you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We believe Agaté will change the way you drink:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s naturally gluten-free so it won’t leave you feeling heavy like beer</li>
<li>Unlike cider and other sugary beer-alternatives, it’s low in sugar (only 5g)</li>
<li>It offers all the health benefits of tea (antioxidants, L-theanine, polyphenol, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We’ve done a lot of work over the summer, but there’s still a lot to be done. Starting an alcoholic beverage business isn’t easy. Specifically, we are aware of the following risks (we want to be upfront with you all):</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution of alcohol in the US can be tricky, and we’re currently working on that</li>
<li>Competition is tough, so we’re working with partners to establish strategic relationships with retailers and industry partners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t or don’t feel comfortable supporting us financially, please spread the word! Drinking different starts today!</p>

We believe Agaté will change the way you drink:

It’s naturally gluten-free so it won’t leave you feeling heavy like beer
Unlike cider and other sugary beer-alternatives, it’s low in sugar (only 5g)
It offers all the health benefits of tea (antioxidants, L-theanine, polyphenol, etc.)

Risks & Challenges
We’ve done a lot of work over the summer, but there’s still a lot to be done. Starting an alcoholic beverage business isn’t easy. Specifically, we are aware of the following risks (we want to be upfront with you all):

Distribution of alcohol in the US can be tricky, and we’re currently working on that
Competition is tough, so we’re working with partners to establish strategic relationships with retailers and industry partners

I have been working for the past 5 years in the Environment Industry and realized one major fact: not everyone has access to safe water.

Kamburov and not long ago I lived and ran a small business in Ukraine. However
as you may know the present situation in Ukraine is not favorable not only for
business but for normal life itself. My home country has been affected by
military conflict. The political situation is complicated and the economy is in
crisis. So I had to shut down my business which was a small video gaming club where I
invested not just my savings but my enthusiasm and plans for a better future. 
</p><p>In search of new
opportunities to set up my life I moved to Bulgaria – a small but nice and
hospitable European country at the Black Sea coast. </p>

small gaming club where people will be able to play the latest console games,
to share their passion for gaming with friends, to relax in cozy atmosphere, to
have a couple of beers or just coffee and fresh and generally have good time
and fun<span>  like it was in my place back in
Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>I have experience,
a detailed business plan, strong personal motivation and I can count on the support of
some Bulgarian friends here. So the only
ingredient missing in the recipe for success of this enterprise is the starting
capital. I hope to get your support and bring my business idea into life.

My name is Sergey
Kamburov and not long ago I lived and ran a small business in Ukraine. However
as you may know the present situation in Ukraine is not favorable not only for
business but for normal life itself. My home country has been affected by
military conflict. The political situation is complicated and the economy is in
crisis. So I had to shut down my business which was a small video gaming club where I
invested not just my savings but my enthusiasm and plans for a better future. 
In search of new
opportunities to set up my life I moved to Bulgaria – a small but nice and
hospitable European country at the Black Sea coast. 
Here, in the city of Sofia, I decided to start up the same business enterprise. 
I’d like to start a
small gaming club where people will be able to play the latest console games,
to share their passion for gaming with friends, to relax in cozy atmosphere, to
have a couple of beers or just coffee and fresh and generally have good time
and fun  like it was in my place back in
Ukraine.
I have experience,
a detailed business plan, strong personal motivation and I can count on the support of
some Bulgarian friends here. So the only
ingredient missing in the recipe for success of this enterprise is the starting
capital. I hope to get your support and bring my business idea into life.
Together we can make X-Play go!
Thank you and let all your dreams come true!What I Need Your Support For

The PointBreezeway Patio Project is all about optimization! 
1. We need the ability to seat more people = building a deck. 
2. We need coverage that can handle the (Pittsburgh..double yoi) weather = building a structure off of the house that is able to be enclosed with a heater for the cold months and when it rains. 
3. We need proper access into the building = incorporating ramps that are to code. 

We are asking for $10,000 to help us transform our patio into a functional and absolutely necessary improvement to our business.

the ordinance did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The State Supreme 
Court denied a petition for hearing.</span></p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The Fourth Amendment bars prosecution of a person who has refused 
to permit a warrantless code enforcement inspection of his personal

against the States through the Fourteenth, through its prohibition of 
""unreasonable"" searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and 
security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental 
officials.  P.  <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html#528"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">387 U. S. 528</a>.</p>

<p>(c) Contrary to the assumption of <em>Frank v. Maryland, supra,</em> 
Fourth Amendment interests are not merely ""peripheral"" where municipal 
fire, health, and housing inspection programs are involved whose purpose
 is to determine the existence of physical conditions not complying with

<p>2. Probable cause upon the basis of which warrants are to be issued 
for area code enforcement inspections is not dependent on the 
inspector's belief that a particular dwelling violates the code, but on 
the reasonableness of the enforcement agency's appraisal of conditions 
in the area as a whole.  The standards to guide the magistrate in the 
issuance of such search warrants will necessarily vary with the

2. Probable cause upon the basis of which warrants are to be issued 
for area code enforcement inspections is not dependent on the 
inspector's belief that a particular dwelling violates the code, but on 
the reasonableness of the enforcement agency's appraisal of conditions 
in the area as a whole.  The standards to guide the magistrate in the 
issuance of such search warrants will necessarily vary with the 
municipal program being enforced.  Pp.  387 U. S. 534-539.
3. Search warrants which are required in nonemergency situations should normally be sought only after entry is refused.  Pp.  387 U. S. 539-540.
4. In the nonemergency situation here, appellant had a right to insist that the inspectors obtain a search warrant.  P.  387 U. S. 540.

                (R.S. § 1979; Pub. L. 96–170, § 1, Dec. 29, 1979, 93 Stat. 1284; Pub. L. 104–317, title III, § 309(c), Oct. 19, 1996, 110 Stat. 3853.)This issue affects everyone whose sewage runs into the Johnstown Regional sewage system. The Westmont example that follows can be applied to all properties that are under this mandate.The Westmont ordinance.On May 1, 2015, the Westmont Borough council members began requiring all homeowners to upgrade their private sewage lines in order to prevent ground water from entering the public sewage lines. Currently their ordinance prevents owners from selling their homes by making it unlawful to transfer a title before a compliance test has been satisfied.  Eventually this mandate will extend to all homeowners even if they are not selling their homes. This ordinance could cost you thousands if not, tens of thousands of dollars to comply. The net effect on your property values is that it will further erode your investment into your home. My attorneys inform me that the ordinance is an unconstitutional intrusion into your privacy and violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution and therefore legally unenforceable, yet some home owners are submitting to the mandate to just get out of the Borough. When challenged the Westmont Borough Council members have simply refuse to listen to their constitutions and reverse their mandate. I am prepared to spearhead a legal challenge in Federal Court to block the mandate on constitutional grounds, but I need your help.We need to raise a minimum of $10,000 to retain counsel to undertake this campaign. Your contributions will not be accepted unless we reach our goal. There is no risk to donate. Please consider supporting this cause to save our community from excessive government intrusion into our home investments.Thanks and best regards,Doc",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<div>
<div>
<strong style=""background-color: initial;"">The system is made of a <strong>Pad</strong>, and an associated <strong>Smartphone/Tablet application</strong>.</strong><br/>
</div>
<div>The first time you will use the Pad, you just need to place on it the item that you want to monitor, set its current level, and…just forget it!<br/>
</div>
<div>  
</div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">              </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1192694/files/20150203043607-Latte_e_controllo_GIF_1.2.gif?1422966967"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 363.04932735426px; height: 230px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<br/><p>From now on, the <strong>Pad will start talking to your mobil</strong><b>e</b>, exchanging the information on the quantity of the good placed on it, silently, without you even noticing it.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>When you are shopping</strong>, or arriving home, is when you really need to know that data. You take your mobile, and see for yourself if something needs to be bought or not.</li>
<li> <strong>You can make your life even easier</strong>, by setting an alarm that will alert you when something is below a certain level. The alarm can be set for a specific time, or for when you approach a certain location (like your home or shop).</li>
<li>
<strong> You can have the application send a message to a person of your choice</strong> (your partner, your trusted grocery store guy right around the corner), when something is almost finished, and he or she will bring it to you.</li>
<li> <strong>You can easily edit your shopping list</strong>, and be sure that the things that really matter to you are always available.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Or</p>
<p>You have a small shop, and you don’t want to spend all your day running through the corridors, <strong>to be sure that the pantries are always kept full</strong>.</p>
<p>Well…You can monitor them…just from your desk. And you will know when you need to refill.</p>
<p><em>There are endless scenarios, and indeed you, the user, will surely have your own special needs and ways to exploit the capabilities of the system.</em></p>

<em>
<p>Here are few things you need to know to assess if <strong>SmartQsine™ </strong>is suitable for your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Pad is as thin as possible</strong>. It is not going to be another bulky gadget in your home.</li>
<li>
<strong>The associated app is made to be as streamlined as possible</strong>, although very flexible. It has been developed with the idea that it will do its work in the background, without bothering you and with minimal effort. It will do the job for you.</li>
<li>
<strong>The same app will monitor several pads</strong>, thus allowing you to take care of all your items in a central, user friendly environment.</li>

<h2><b>                        FLAVOURS</b></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>To allow the user to save costs, we have developed 2 lines of Pads: <strong>Gold Pad</strong>, and <strong>Silver Pad</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Gold Pad</strong> has the capability to communicate with the mobile application, and to monitor not only what the user places on it, but also to acquire the data coming from several other Pads linked to it.</p>
<p>The <strong>Silver Pad</strong> doesn’t have communication capabilities, thus allowing it to be much cheaper than the Gold one. Once a Silver Pad is physically linked to a Gold Pad, it will be seen by the mobile application as a new independent Pad, with all the required features of the Gold model.</p>
<p>This means that,<strong> if a user wants to monitor multiple goods, she/he can purchase several Gold Pads, or just one Gold Pad, and several Silver ones</strong> to accomplish the same task.</p>

<p>We know that <strong>everybody has different needs</strong>. If milk is a good example of something that many of us never want to run out, it is clear to us that we needed to provide a solution able to get close to the requirements of most of the people or businesses.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>That’s why we made things so flexible!</strong></p>

<div>Uriel has two children, and all too often realized too late that the milk would not be enough for tomorrow morning's breakfast.</div>
<div>While thinking on a way to be advised before actually approaching home, we realized that a system able to solve this issue, would also solve many other similar issues, and be useful in several scenarios and applications, not only in the consumer market, but also the small business environment (think about a bar, a small restaurant...)</div>
<div>It was <b>February 2014</b>

<p><b>How are the Pads Powered?</b></p>
<p>The Pads are powered by a standard coin battery (CR2032). It lasts for about 6 months and can be easily replaced once it runs out.</p>
<p><b>How do I know when the battery is running out?</b></p>
<p>Nothing should ever run out in the SmartQsine world....</p>

<p><b>Why BLE?</b></p>
<p>The system, as you see it now, and as you will receive it, is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology.</p>
<p>We decided to go in this direction for mainly two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power. Using BLE we can provide a product whose battery lasts for 6 months.</li>
<li>BLE is now present in every new phone and smartphone, thus allowing the user to exploit what is already at hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using WiFi would have enabled the user to directly connect to the pads from the street. However, it would have been too power consuming, and we didn't want the user to change the battery or recharge it every week.</p>
<p>Z-Wave, by comparison, is not as power hungry as WiFi, but it would have required a gateway in order to allow the user to reach the pads from outside.</p>
<p>We therefore decided for BLE, and automatic Background Synchronization. The user can decide how often he wants the Smartphone to synchronize with the pads and set the hours that he wants this synchronization to happen (it would be useless to try to sync when you are not home).  </p>
<p>At the same time we have already started the development of a BLE/WiFi gateway, to allow the users to have a real time access, if he or she wishes, and the development of pads based on WiFi technology, for ""plugged"" scenarios.<br/></p>
<p><b>Can different people be linked on the same pad?</b></p>
<p>Every member of a family, or roommates, can have the data synched between them. So, if your partner consumes a good when you are away from home, his/her Smartphone will be synched, and so will be yours.</p>
<p><b>Which kind of alerts may I set up?</b></p>
<p>We have so far developed two kinds of alerts:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Time based: at a certain time, specified by the user, the application will notify the user if an item is below a certain level (for example, a user can set the time that he usually gets out of the office, in order to be alerted if something needs to be procured before getting home).</li>
<li>Person based: a message will automatically be sent to a person of choice when items go below a specified threshold (yourself, your partner, the grocery store<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, or catering service like the  scenario seen in the video regarding the Kitchen in ARM's laboratories).</span>

</div></div>","EVERY ONE OF US HAS A FEW THINGS THAT WE REALLY DON’T WANT TO RUN OUT OF...







SmartQsine™ takes care of whatever you decide that needs to be monitored, and does the job for you, giving you the information only when you really need it!












                     HOW IT WORKS




The system is made of a Pad, and an associated Smartphone/Tablet application.

The first time you will use the Pad, you just need to place on it the item that you want to monitor, set its current level, and…just forget it!

  

              
From now on, the Pad will start talking to your mobile, exchanging the information on the quantity of the good placed on it, silently, without you even noticing it.


When you are shopping, or arriving home, is when you really need to know that data. You take your mobile, and see for yourself if something needs to be bought or not.
 You can make your life even easier, by setting an alarm that will alert you when something is below a certain level. The alarm can be set for a specific time, or for when you approach a certain location (like your home or shop).

 You can have the application send a message to a person of your choice (your partner, your trusted grocery store guy right around the corner), when something is almost finished, and he or she will bring it to you.
 You can easily edit your shopping list, and be sure that the things that really matter to you are always available.

Or
You have a small shop, and you don’t want to spend all your day running through the corridors, to be sure that the pantries are always kept full.
Well…You can monitor them…just from your desk. And you will know when you need to refill.
There are endless scenarios, and indeed you, the user, will surely have your own special needs and ways to exploit the capabilities of the system.
 
                            MORE

Here are few things you need to know to assess if SmartQsine™ is suitable for your needs:


The Pad is as thin as possible. It is not going to be another bulky gadget in your home.

The associated app is made to be as streamlined as possible, although very flexible. It has been developed with the idea that it will do its work in the background, without bothering you and with minimal effort. It will do the job for you.

The same app will monitor several pads, thus allowing you to take care of all your items in a central, user friendly environment.



                        FLAVOURS


To allow the user to save costs, we have developed 2 lines of Pads: Gold Pad, and Silver Pad
The Gold Pad has the capability to communicate with the mobile application, and to monitor not only what the user places on it, but also to acquire the data coming from several other Pads linked to it.
The Silver Pad doesn’t have communication capabilities, thus allowing it to be much cheaper than the Gold one. Once a Silver Pad is physically linked to a Gold Pad, it will be seen by the mobile application as a new independent Pad, with all the required features of the Gold model.
This means that, if a user wants to monitor multiple goods, she/he can purchase several Gold Pads, or just one Gold Pad, and several Silver ones to accomplish the same task.


                      



                  CUSTOMIZATIONS

We know that everybody has different needs. If milk is a good example of something that many of us never want to run out, it is clear to us that we needed to provide a solution able to get close to the requirements of most of the people or businesses.

That’s why we made things so flexible!
We can easily modify the Pad and the features of the mobile application, in order to fit with your special requirements.



                TALKING ABOUT US








   WHY WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT

We need to go into production, and produce around 2500 pads in order to make them cost effective.
Moreover, we want to go beyond it... expanding devices' capabilities, its usage contexts, and the services that we can provide along with the application, which are too many to be developed in advance.

How you can help:



                                                   REFERRAL PROGRAM


More ways to help...
Spread your voice! Tell as many people as possibile about SmartQsine
""Like us"" on Facebook, ""Follow"" us on Twitter, participate, and suggest new ideas and applications. 
We are hungry for customizations. If you see a particular application suitable for our system, please share it with us, and tell them about us. We can easily adapt the system for plenty of scenarios. The electronics are there, the application too... We would just need to modify the pads !

What if....
Tooling Costs are always a huge barrier...
If we reach $ 150.000, we will add this perk too: a multi Pad able to monitor 4 items at a time.
                                             
The Electronic and the Application are ready (they are actually the same as per the single Pads already developed). We would just would need to cover the Non Recurring Cost required to start the production


                     OUR JOURNEY



















As for many cases, the idea came for everyday life.
Uriel has two children, and all too often realized too late that the milk would not be enough for tomorrow morning's breakfast.
While thinking on a way to be advised before actually approaching home, we realized that a system able to solve this issue, would also solve many other similar issues, and be useful in several scenarios and applications, not only in the consumer market, but also the small business environment (think about a bar, a small restaurant...)
It was February 2014

In two months, we prepared all the papers to validate the idea (Business Model Canvas, Business Plan, a maximalized architecture), selected and built the right  team, patented the system, and started the development.


June 2014:

We patented the system, the brand ""SmartQsine"", and started the company that manages all.
We realized our first firmware using using ARM® mbed™ during the development stage to make it easy to prove the concept is viable, and a demo application running on Android and iOS. 
Everything was very ugly...but functioning





September 2014


While moving forward on the Software side, we also began developing our own first PCB, and started seeing how the pad would look like





November 2014
Finally...the product was ready!
Android application fully developed, a new PCB board, Firmware optimized, mechanical interface and case finalized!


                                                    
So, we decided to go to CES2015....


January 2015
A very small batch of pads were realized, and the application consolidated. The system was introduced for the first time to the public, at CES 2015. 


                                    




Immediatelyafter
returning from CES, we were invited by the Italian National Broadcasting TV, to
show it live.



February 2015
New features have been implemented, bug fixing was in process and we had several rounds to find the best way and right manufacturers for the mass production.
ARM people came to know that we have been using  mbed™ during the development process. They invited us at their headquarters in Cambridge, tested and shot the Catering Scenario, and placed a Gold Pad in their demo room (where it still is).


                                         



March 2015Started preparing the crowdfunding campaign, and attended another exhibition, this time, in Milan, called ""Seeds & Chips"".

                                  FAQ
How are the Pads Powered?
The Pads are powered by a standard coin battery (CR2032). It lasts for about 6 months and can be easily replaced once it runs out.
How do I know when the battery is running out?
Nothing should ever run out in the SmartQsine world....
An alert will show up at the Pad tab on the application, to alert you that the battery is almost over.
How many Pads can the application manage?
No Limit
Why BLE?
The system, as you see it now, and as you will receive it, is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology.
We decided to go in this direction for mainly two reasons:

Power. Using BLE we can provide a product whose battery lasts for 6 months.
BLE is now present in every new phone and smartphone, thus allowing the user to exploit what is already at hand.

Using WiFi would have enabled the user to directly connect to the pads from the street. However, it would have been too power consuming, and we didn't want the user to change the battery or recharge it every week.
Z-Wave, by comparison, is not as power hungry as WiFi, but it would have required a gateway in order to allow the user to reach the pads from outside.
We therefore decided for BLE, and automatic Background Synchronization. The user can decide how often he wants the Smartphone to synchronize with the pads and set the hours that he wants this synchronization to happen (it would be useless to try to sync when you are not home).  
At the same time we have already started the development of a BLE/WiFi gateway, to allow the users to have a real time access, if he or she wishes, and the development of pads based on WiFi technology, for ""plugged"" scenarios.
Can different people be linked on the same pad?
Every member of a family, or roommates, can have the data synched between them. So, if your partner consumes a good when you are away from home, his/her Smartphone will be synched, and so will be yours.
Which kind of alerts may I set up?
We have so far developed two kinds of alerts:


Time based: at a certain time, specified by the user, the application will notify the user if an item is below a certain level (for example, a user can set the time that he usually gets out of the office, in order to be alerted if something needs to be procured before getting home).
Person based: a message will automatically be sent to a person of choice when items go below a specified threshold (yourself, your partner, the grocery store, or catering service like the  scenario seen in the video regarding the Kitchen in ARM's laboratories).

Geographically based: An alert will show up when you reach a specific place (like
your local grocery store), for any item that is below a specified threshold (you need to have GPS enabled for this)

More might be introduced based on your suggestions

Would you provide API/SDKs for partners to integrate the pads in other systems?

We are very open to integrate SmartQsine into the current available Home Automation systems and provide the required APIs
You could either access to the pads directly and build/integrate your own application, or exploit all the development already undertaken by ourselves on the application side.


                            RISK & CHALLENGES


There is always a certain degree of risk,
when you support a product that has not yet been certified. However, we think we
have taken all the required measures to minimize it as far as reasonably
possible, and are now able to go crowdfounding with an already developed product,
intensively tested, showed and demoed in public.
What we are missing is the money to move to
full scale production, and believe that with the target set in this campaign,
it would be more than enough to achieve this.
We have also decided against going for
flexible funding, since receiving less money than what we believe is required
for full production, would have jeopardized the ability to fulfill our commitment
to our backers, and hence our decision to approach the crowdfunding
marketplace.",35.0,1,"1 Campaign

I specialise in bespoke furniture design, refinishing and run workshops tutoring traditional arts and crafts. This is my story so far..............So the next chapter has arrived. I have the keys for the new workshop and the place needs an entire overhaul WHICH I PLEASE NEED YOUR HELP WITH!I’m so excited but also very emotional after a rather eventful 4 years.I started OP Woodcraft due to rather unexpected heart failure, difficulties managing mental health and an overwhelming desire to take control of my future. I wanted to find balance, fulfilment in my career and most importantly see my two beautiful children grow up.Well I did that and more! My life is controlled by myself, I’m so happy, stressed in a completely manageable way,  healthy (touch wood) and I get to balance work and family in a way that works perfectly for us all.Amongst a great deal of stress and heart ache I stumbled across my soul mate Emily Redford and my family instantly grew. With Emily’s three little boys too, our home is hectic, messy and full of love. Emily just so happens to be a talented artist and we share the same outlook on life a desire to recycle, design, innovate and teach arts and crafts. She will be joining me in the business and showcasing her own art work. So, it is time to expand, improve on production time, increase our skill set, offer more courses/workshops and to try to establish the business as I wrote 4 years ago in my business plan.Why we are campaigning for a helping handThe money we're asking for is to make the new workshop/school a safe, clean, warm and inviting place for myself, my partner and for our students.This is not any old cry for help. Everything you put in to fund the renovation you'll receive a product of choice in return. Whether it be a coat hook, a piece of fine art, a bespoke dining table or a day’s tuition in French polishing it will all help towards the following:- A complete wall strip, boarding and painting.- We have no heating which we desperately need before winter.

<p>Imagine finding an <strong>archival film of your grandparents</strong>, or a <strong>student film your parent shot in high school.</strong> You want to preserve it, make it viewable on more platforms, and even improve its quality. But to do so you have to risk shipping to another state, pay a hefty premium, and wait an extended period of time to get results.<br/><i>With a <strong>Kinetta, a Hollywood grade 4k film scanner,</strong> Seattle can enjoy a local, high-quality film preservation service at a fraction of current prices and a fast turnaround.</i></p>
<h3>
<strong> I'm Steven Bradford</strong>. As a filmmaker with almost <i>4 decades of experience</i> as a producer, a cinematographer, an editor, and a film lab worker, I care deeply about <strong>preserving and improving resources for local filmmakers.</strong>
</h3>
<p>I’m launching this <i>Indiegogo campaign</i> so I can bring a vital service to filmmakers in <strong>Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.</strong></p>
<p>For those of us continuing to shoot some of our productions on 16mm or 8mm movie film, or for documentarians using archive film, there are currently no local or regional services available offering the <strong>highest quality captures to 4k digital files</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, we must ship off our film to <i>Burbank, Denver, or Boston</i>, where the choices <i>are expensive and slow. </i>For those of us with valuable old film, whether family memories or important moments in Seattle’s past, we’re understandably <strong>nervous about sending those precious captured memories so far off.</strong> Also, many of these oldest films are fading, and they won’t always be able to extract the color<i> or even the images from them.</i></p>
<p><strong>A Kinetta scanner</strong> can solve these issues. This amazing piece of equipment not only captures film to digital at high resolution, <strong>preserving all the detail, highlights, <i>and</i> shadows</strong>, but it is also incredibly gentle on old films that have curled or shrunk--<strong>or have tears and holes.</strong></p>
<p>Even better, It’s a fraction of the cost of what professional scanners at this quality level have been. They can cost as much as half a million dollars, but the new Kinetta for 16mm and 8mm film <i>is a fraction of that.</i> I’ll be able to offer much more affordable scanning costs--<strong>especially for productions, archives, and schools that often have many reels to capture at a time</strong>.</p>
<h3>I'm a freelance cinematographer deeply interested in keeping film work active in the northwest, but I don’t have deep pockets.</h3>
<p><br/><strong>To jumpstart the service,</strong> I will be offering film transfers as donation rewards. I’ll start with <i>one small roll of 16mm or 8mm digitized at the $15 level,</i> to <i>five rolls at the $50 level</i> and on up, providing larger discounts for bulk work. In addition, I’ll make it a <strong>transferable certificate</strong> so even if you don’t personally have the film right now, you can give it to a friend or relative who does.</p>
<p>Although many major films in Los Angeles or New York, from big studios to indies <strong>continue to be photographed on film</strong>, and they can see the results of their work in a day. But in Seattle  we wait <strong>several days or a week or more </strong>to get our results. It's particularly difficult for students, because assignments can’t be turned around quickly during a term, or in a workshop, the way we used to in the northwest. Though film still  has to be sent out for processing, that is usually turned around in a day or two in Burbank, but the essential next step of digitizing adds a week or more to that.</p>

<p>My solution is to bring a high end <strong>4k film scanner</strong>, (<i>above</i>) called a Kinetta, to the Pacific Northwest.

They can cost as much as half a million dollars, but the new Kinetta for 8 and 16mm film is a tenth of that. That will enable me to offer <strong>much more affordable scanning costs,</strong> especially for productions, archives and schools that often have many reels to capture at a time.Still that’s a big risk for me to take on. I'm a freelance cinematographer deeply interested in keeping film work active in the northwest, but I don’t have deep pockets.

I’ll make it a transferable certificate, so even if you don’t personally have film right now, you can give it to a friend or relative who does. Of course, if you just want to see this service become available in the northwest, and contribute extra, that's possible too.My funding goal is set so that if I can get halfway to what I'll need to order the Kinetta for 8 to 16 film, I'll be able to go ahead and order the unit, and I can start transforming film right away.</p>
<h3>Why do I think I’ll be able to do this successfully?</h3>
<p>Number one, <strong>I don’t need to set up a lab</strong>. The Kinetta is a table top unit, it <i>doesn’t need high power, compressed air, plumbing and other infrastructure requirements</i> of the big iron legacy units. It is more of a PC peripheral.</p>
<p><br/>My own experience with film is deep.

  I would like to draw your attention today to the dramatic situation currently enduring gays in Africa.Many countries of the African continent apply repressive legislations with anti-gay laws and consider homosexuality like a crime.Regarding violations of LGBT rights in many Countries in Africa, the following cases are recurring:- Arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions: Committed by law enforcement officers, these violations are intended to intimidate and extortion of victims then would follow  unlawful detentions that can lead to physical abuse such as  rape and other degrading treatment such as requiring a detainee to get naked and anally insertion of some objects like stick!- Infringement procedures: Once a LGBT person is arrested, fundamental rights such as the presumption of innocence and the right to silence and the presence of a lawyer are omitted.- Demonization by some populist politicians and evangelists: most preachers of evangelists churches have  very homophobic speech towards LGBT. They use to associate homosexuality with Satanism. On the other side, some politicians reinforce this hatred towards LGBT by their statements claiming that the relations between two men or two women is an import from Europe and America. They add that this form of sexuality is not in agreement with African traditions.

A BRIEF INTRODUCTION The world's cities are sprouting with plans for new towers and skyscrapers, a sign of twin booms in creativity and wealth. But many people still have concerns for safety & survival  in case of emergency.

Motivated by the latest news of shocking earthquake and natural disasters around the world we thought of a device that can potentially save thousands of lives and avoid casualties.
This project aims ultimately to build a prototype and test the next generation of emergency and rescue crafts. This technology offers emergency aerial to ground protection for people in a crisis situation, similar by comparison to  what life rafts provide for people in shipwrecks at sea.

EXTENDED TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION FOR SHIP'S SAFETY
It is very common for a ship to lean on one side before sinking making impossibe to lower life boats and life rafts  during abandon ship emergencies. Life shell technology could potentially solve this issue and guarantee emergency escape in any circumstances.




EXTENDED TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION FOR AVIATION SAFETY
Life shell technology could potentially be use for emergency escape or embedded into modern airplane architecture to provide extra level of protection to passengers in case of emergency and crash landing . Lining the fuselage with Kevlar and non newtonian fluid mixture would help the structure stay intact and not brake off in peaces while offering protection to passengers from fire related injuries. Airbags and crash sensor could help passengers also avoid injuries during crash landing.

WHAT IS LIFE SHELL?
The life shell is a inflatable  craft that can easily be deployed  from any structure including skyscrapers or airplanes for emergency escape and rescue in case of accidents, natural disasters, destructive fires, tsunamis and even in the case of terrorist attacks. Life Shell can protect people in case of building collapse thanks to its impact resistance and heat protective properties.
HOW DOES IT WORKS ? 

IMPACT/SHOCK ABSORBENT ( Kevlar, Zylon lining, Airbags, QR Parachute)

This invention utilize a combination of non-newtonian fluids technology along with Kevlar airbags that allows the life shell to be shock resistant for high altitude drops and high pressures due to high force impacts . Additionally a quick release parachute is utilized in case of high altitude drops to slow down accidental fast acceleration and ultimately guarantee a safe descent .
A dilatant Non- Newtonian fluid provides protection, as well as material flexibility.
The inner lining of the life shell is composed of freely moving molecules however, upon impact the molecules bind together turning the soft putty into a solid block barrier.




HEAT RESISTANT / FIRE PROTECTIVE ( Zylon , SEAgel )
 SEAgel (Safe Emulsion Agar gel) is one of a class of high-tech foam materials known as aerogels. It is an excellent thermal insulator . This material is used to line the inner and outer layers of the Life Shell craft to enable it to withstand fire and be heat resistant.

<h3>Growing the Good</h3> <p>For the last three years, JUNE DRESSES™ has partnered with local women-focused charities in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>Our pilot campaigns have been a big success with over 500 hundred participants raising more than $90,000 for a variety of local women-focused causes. Now we're looking to  expand JUNE DRESSES™ as a fundraising campaign throughout Canada and the United States. Expanding nationally requires partners with a national focus and we are eager to speak with women-focused charities and corporate sponsors about potential partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>We believe empowering women is key to building a great community for all. It helps create stronger families and confident individuals, which will strengthen the lives of those around us. JUNE DRESSES™ has helped support women in areas such as immigration, safety, domestic violence, poverty and mental health by raising funds and awareness. The broader we expand, the more good we can go and you can help!<br/></p>

Both Togo and France are huge footballing nations and I’m a football coach.</p><br/><p>With an instinctive understanding and love of children, from my early teens I’ve been involved with mentoring young people. At the age of 17, I became a youth leader and worked for over a decade in youth camps all over France, including those for the mentally and physically handicapped.  Twenty years on, I still get cards from some of those kids, now grown up and with lives of their own.  Giving encouragement and guidance to young people is my forte.</p><br/><p>Football is my passion and through football I teach children respect, discipline and good sportsmanship in the firm belief that these qualities remain with them off the pitch. I am strict, very strict! And it works. 3 years ago, I set up a football school in San Miguel using a municipal pitch and we soon had around 40 children coming twice a week. They’re still coming and now we want to give them their own home.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KkXy7gyPWOpWByjJUX0qMAFw438lDKHy23agg6v_wwNfi8XHAotY-AuXhzC9pZTgxnBeYGpHjX-1ZU5maSco0yyF7885_wPf4JO5hyj0itZ5LwLGqXF_JhtppgvLFEaF6YywcoBQ"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p>THE PLACE:</p><p>San Miguel is one of Mexico’s top tourist destinations, a World Heritage site with 140,000 inhabitants, it is 2.5 hours north of the capital, Mexico City. There is a large foreign presence, mostly Americans and Canadians and although they represent less than 10% of the population, they have a considerable cultural and economic impact. But there are still many areas which don’t benefit. With a burgeoning youth population, there is huge unemployment, no regular sporting fixtures and no youth clubs.This project will create jobs and positively contribute to the community. </p><br/><br/><p>THE SCHOOL</p><p>By building a football pitch and setting up a club and league, my team and I will inspire children and guide them to be good human beings. Their self esteem will grow so they can be useful members of the community. My personal goal is not to be just another tourist enjoying the sun, but to make a real difference.</p><br/><p>My motto is - everyone counts or nobody does.  Every child plays in every match, no matter their skill level.

Both Togo and France are huge footballing nations and I’m a football coach.With an instinctive understanding and love of children, from my early teens I’ve been involved with mentoring young people. At the age of 17, I became a youth leader and worked for over a decade in youth camps all over France, including those for the mentally and physically handicapped.  Twenty years on, I still get cards from some of those kids, now grown up and with lives of their own.  Giving encouragement and guidance to young people is my forte.Football is my passion and through football I teach children respect, discipline and good sportsmanship in the firm belief that these qualities remain with them off the pitch. I am strict, very strict! And it works. 3 years ago, I set up a football school in San Miguel using a municipal pitch and we soon had around 40 children coming twice a week. They’re still coming and now we want to give them their own home.THE PLACE:San Miguel is one of Mexico’s top tourist destinations, a World Heritage site with 140,000 inhabitants, it is 2.5 hours north of the capital, Mexico City. There is a large foreign presence, mostly Americans and Canadians and although they represent less than 10% of the population, they have a considerable cultural and economic impact. But there are still many areas which don’t benefit. With a burgeoning youth population, there is huge unemployment, no regular sporting fixtures and no youth clubs.This project will create jobs and positively contribute to the community. THE SCHOOLBy building a football pitch and setting up a club and league, my team and I will inspire children and guide them to be good human beings. Their self esteem will grow so they can be useful members of the community. My personal goal is not to be just another tourist enjoying the sun, but to make a real difference.My motto is - everyone counts or nobody does.  Every child plays in every match, no matter their skill level. This means sometimes we lose. The children have come to understand why I do this. They’ve learned the basics, that being part of a team is more important than personal glory or winning. I am teaching them the longer game.There are several international schools - but none with a dedicated football curriculum - and from our research there is a lot of interest in starting one.Now we want to move the Los Halcones project to the next stage.THE PROJECT:We have a hectare of desert land fed by natural spring water with mains electricity. We have obtained planning permission to build a 7 a side artificial football pitch, a car park and the Los Halcones building containing the cafe / clubhouse and salon de fiestas (event space). The land is on a bus route just a couple of kilometers outside San Miguel and is easily accessible from the town. It’s surrounded by burgeoning villages with no provision for young people, either sports facilities, cafes or any youth clubs. Literally hundreds of youngsters in these communities will benefit from the school. Football is a national obsession in Mexico and this is a project that will grow and grow as new members join. There is a huge demand in the town for pitches, and they’re not always available.The Pitch:It will take 3 months to level the ground and build the pitch and the car park. We aim to build a 7 a side artificial pitch 60m x 38m, which meets international standards, complete with lights to play at night. While local schools and the Los Halcones children’s team will use this pitch during the day, local adult teams will hire it after 6pm and at the weekends.  This will generate revenue for the business and subsidise the kids.To build the pitch we need $100,000 US dollars as a first step. $85,000 for the pitch and an extra $15,000 for toilets, fencing and a small office.The Clubhouse:Los Halcones will have discrete spaces for the arts, music, exercise & classes for the community - all at low cost.

The reason for always charging, is that in my experience, children and parents are more committed when they spend something - no matter how little. THE TIME FRAMEWe’d like to approach this project in 2 stages.1) The first 3 months : Winter 2016 - Spring 2017: To level the land and build the car park, the pitch and a temporary office with toilet facility.  COST = $100,000 US dollars2) The following 6 months : (Spring 2017 - end of Summer 2017) To build the cafe/clubhouse/salon de fiestas and landscape the site.COST = $200,000 US dollarsFUTURE PLANSWe will set up training courses for coaches and football camps for national and international students. Our aim is to build a swimming pool (semi-Olympic / 25m) and provide swimming lessons to kids … and climbing walls ….. gradually Los Halcones will become a sports complex.

<h4>Any questions are welcome.</h4></div>","In the age of the Internet, ignorance is a choice, and we
would like to help to provide information resources freely- to anyone who wants to
learn about a myriad of topics. We aim for each text to be from a
well-researched perspective as to avoiding disinformation.
We will strive to deliver a responsible, original, and
independent analysis of world events and other major topics of interest and
importance. In every situation, we will try our best to provide as much
relevant information as possible, without flooding people with triviality or
fear based sensationalism and propaganda.
The category of media freedom means the safety of a society
and its institutions to speak freely in the formulation of public policy and to be able to
highlight without fear a range of anti-social blocks to development such as corruption and
human rights abuses
Freedom of speech is the
main measure of openness in a society. Where there is room for dissent and new
voices, there is space for people with all their differences. Yet this space is too often limited by those in power, mass media and large corporations that
silence and marginalize voices through aggressive censorship, mass espionage
and growing media monopolies.These days,
major media sources have too many ties with people and organizations that want
to influence what’s reported—think billionaire owners, mega-corporations, and
big-money advertisers.
The
«Independent Media» will be a truly independent alternative because it will be
one hundred percent people funded. Plus, while it shares a similar spirit
with the bloggers and citizen reporters, Independent Media will have the
resources and staffing to make it an easily accessed center stage for
high-quality, independent reporting.
The
organizers and authors Michael Gershzon and Sergey Koulby, in partnership with
a network of experienced and international producers, editors, and independent
investigative journalists, will offer original stories and investigative reports, editorials, and
discussion forums within the «Independent Media» project.
«Independent
Media» will be a news and multimedia network unlike anything else online, in
print, or on TV. It will offer all of the elements people expect from a large
news organization and also utilize social media, a mobile app (news alerts, etc.),
and other Internet platforms.The website is under construction
All
«Independent Media» reports and multimedia productions will be entirely
independent and nonpartisan and will be developed, written, produced, and
vetted by our staff, which will be paid with funding from the public. 
Except for
special forums and roundtable discussions, all «Independent Media» contents
will be free to the public. For those who want access to all of the site’s
contents, the subscription fee will amount to $9.99 per month.
Our goal for the end of year two is to expand our
subscriber base to 30,000. That would equate to $299,000 per/month, which would
be enough to support «Independent Media» annual operations. Every dollar we receive that
excess of our goal will go to funding further content, expanded program offerings,
additional journalists, etc.
It’s time to stand up for our right to be informed and

only to its viewers and to the truth.
To launch what we believe will be the first truly
independent and agenda-free major media network; we need to raise a minimum of

<p>Let’s be honest most of people would like to watch not only porn channel or video chat with a pretty girl but also to have a sex with this girl. In the world of porn industry there are many stars and some people are ready to pay lots of money to spend a night with one of these stars. Of course there are many reasons why its impossible to do. Or maybe you wanna diversify your sex life with your partner and try smth. new but you both are too shy for it.    </p>
<p>Our technology, with pleasure glasses, can scan the partner’s face in real time  and change it to any one from our catalogue. It is a new reality!   </p>

<h3><strong>About Zoomer's.</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to Zoomer's Cabaret. A unique, interactive concept in a bar/restaurant outing. The friendliest bar in town. Zoomer's main theme is one of “feeling like you're part of the experience” as opposed to an observer.

Our restaurant will be open nightly. A down to earth menu with signature cocktails and favorite feel good food offerings. Visit us at <a href=""https://www.zoomerscabaret.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zoomerscabaret.com</a> </p>
<h3><strong>What makes Zoomer's unique.</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main things we realized that is missing for so many venues is, a sense of familiarity and community. We all remember Cheers. ""Where everyone knows your name"". People love being recognized and feeling like they are part of the community. A key ingredient we will strive for is building a strong sense of familiarity. Our staff will be trained in recognizing regulars and making them feel special. We are not kidding. We really are going for different. Our staff will be expert in friendliness and interacting with customers. Here is one small example of a creative idea to bring back customers regularly and giving them an opportunity to do something different. Once a month we will host ""Rotating dinner. Meet new friends. "" Guests can pre-register and come alone or with a guest. After introductions, guests will rotate on every course. Making new connections and enjoying tantalizing menu items or even a wine tasting. Our host will be on hand to make sure everything runs smoothly and guests have a memorable experience. Luckily we already have many other fun and interactive ideas ready to launch. Here's some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan on hosting a musician's networking open mic night on Mondays.</li>
<li>We plan on hosting a monthly, business networking event, once a month on a Thursday.</li>
<li>We plan on hosting a 4 week ""Palm Beach has talent"" show twice a year on Tuesdays. Yup. Just like the show. With a grand finale party on a Saturday.</li>
<li>We plan on hosting a ""Cinema night"" once a month on Sundays' With giant screen, sound popcorn, hollywood theme the works. Guests will vote on movie choices online.</li>
<li>We plan on hosting a ""family fun day"" twice a year on a Saturday afternoon. Featuring our guests and their kiddies.  Discounted family menu, face painter, balloons and all the other kid friendly entertainment. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The live music experience.  </strong></h3>
<p>We propose great drinks and dining within an always creative, live music experience. A monthly calendar will be posted on our website.  Changing it up week to week and always surprising our guests with fun and innovative theme nights and live bands. Our goal is to get them looking often because we change it up so often. Keeping it fresh and exciting. Some examples: Our Sunday brunches will have a different theme weekly. Gospel brunch. Jazz brunch, Techno brunch, soul brunch etc.. Nightly themes. Outlaw country night, Dueling pianos, DJ &amp; margarita madness, Ladies night, Beetles tribute band, 70's flashback party, civil servant night, twofer tuesdays.

<h3><strong>About the founders.</strong></h3>
<p>After years working for other bar, restaurant and club owners, our dream is to open and create our very own vision. Something really different. We have so many years of experience in the industry. The main thing we took away from working for other bar owners? What not to do! Second, one of our key ingredients will be building a community based venue where the customer experience is our number one priority. Part of our goal is to go out of our way to build an experience where the customer can't wait to come back and tells their friends. Our first venue will be our testing ground.

Quickly learning to bartend, he bartended at over 15 different bars and restaurants. Later, he went on to be the youngest Maître’ d at a popular NYC restaurant. Even though he was building an event planning business, it was this industry that has kept in the game throughout the years.

<p>Bruce got his start in the industry at the age of 15 when he started his first job at the Wellington country club. He stayed with the club for the next four years . His roles included, line cook, waiter and host. At the age of 19, Bruce got his first experiences with the Bar business by helping his former coach open up an Irish Bar. It’s here where he learned all the aspects of bar management. At the age of 22, Bruce started working with Blue Martini. He moved his way up to management in the first 8 months and stayed with them until 2005 when he broke away and opened his first restaurant and nightclub. Savannahs and 23 Lounge.

In some form, he has bartended, managed, promoted and work in the bar/restaurant industry for over 30 years. Most recently, he has been on the management team at Blue Martini. References specific to this industry available upon request.
  Bruce Gregory
Bruce got his start in the industry at the age of 15 when he started his first job at the Wellington country club. He stayed with the club for the next four years . His roles included, line cook, waiter and host. At the age of 19, Bruce got his first experiences with the Bar business by helping his former coach open up an Irish Bar. It’s here where he learned all the aspects of bar management. At the age of 22, Bruce started working with Blue Martini. He moved his way up to management in the first 8 months and stayed with them until 2005 when he broke away and opened his first restaurant and nightclub. Savannahs and 23 Lounge. Bruce stayed with the company for 5 years before making his way back to South Florida and Blue Martini. Bruce managed the Boca Blue Martini for almost a decade and helped out with nearby locations. In 2019 Bruce started consulting with different bar and restaurant chains and is still doing so currently.

What We Need & What You Get
One of the main problems we face is getting started with enough funds to secure a lease, file for licensing, permits and have some working capital. We are currently working with investors to be  part of our vision. Read more here. But, we simply want to be able to secure the right space and not have to go searching for funds once we do. 
Every funded dollar will go into:

Securing a lease with deposits and security. 
Licensing and permit filing.
Some marketing and social media
Preparing our investment plan and legal fees. 

The impact and why you should contribute.

You'll be helping two really nice guys create something special and see their dream become reality.

Hinton, WV is rebuilding and reinventing itself after years of decline in the local economy, which was dependent on the railroad and coal jobs.

We will offer vendor spaces to allow home businesses and individuals access to the commerce on the main street in the city. There are also plans for a coffee cafe and studios to be available for music and art lessons. The town currently has nowhere for children to take lessons and I believe opportunities for creative expression is a cornerstone for community growth and positive change.

Greece Stats
According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, 90% of surveyed households consider political parties to be corrupt or extremely corrupt—ranking as the most corrupt institution in Greece.
The TTax Justice Network has said that there are over €20 billion in Swiss bank accounts held by Greeks.

At the same time:
The percentage of the population on the verge of poverty or social exclusion increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 35.7% in 2013, while serious deprivation of basic goods increased in the country from 11.2% in 2008 to 20.3% in 2013.

The Expendables Agenda

Heist on Swiss banks, “lift” the accounts of tax-evaders, deliver money to associated authority to reduce the greek debt.
Side-targets: 
1. We place a hit on the European policy-makers and Greek politicians in Brussels.
2. We make a stop by Athens, to take out the corrupt hawks of the Greek Parliament who have been clinging on to power for the past three decades.
3. Then we make a stop by the Greek Private tax-evading TV stations and we “solve” them as well.
4. And of course, we take out Sakis Rouvas, the national hero-singer, who propagated shamelessly during the Greek Referendum propaganda in a tv spot of the worst taste.
Greece “solved”. Messy, but not THAT messy...

   Is this serious? 

The Expendables part is not.
This is a campaign which aims to spread some awareness around the topic and shed some humour in the most dark of times for Europe and Greece. It is Fixed Funding campaign which means if it does not reach its unrealistic goal,  Indiegogo will refund all your money, which is 99,999999% possibility. Yup, it is not going to reach its goal.

Sharing is the most important bit.Help us break the internet with this one. Follow us on Twitter and like our    Facebook page to help spread the word and get the updates. Use the buttons to the left to share on social media.

What if it reaches its goal? What if Stallone really wants to take matters into his own hands?
In case laser unicorns do exist, and the sun gravitates around Earth, this campaign will turn into a crowd funding campaign and will use your support to help Greece and its struggling economy by funding small businesses oriented around the only productive sectors in Greece atm. 
We want to support the the growth of Greece instead of feeding pills to the cripple. Agriculture, artisan businesses, new technologies, the victims of the recent years crisis, need recovery. 
We will team up with extremely “non-corrupt” non profits to achieve that.
And maybe the Expendables might want to chip in anyway.
We can only support all the problems Greece and the constitution of Europe is facing today, by raising awareness on the topic, and supporting Greece anyway that we can.

Update: Skype call with my colleague Krishna in Nepal and images the team is collecting from the ground

This campaign is to raise funds that my colleagues in Nepal will use to help people who live in their same Kathmandu neighborhoods, while rescuers struggle to find those still trapped under rubble and aid stations deployment is delayed. 

The company I work for has a small software development office in Kathmandu, As head of product, I have been working very closely with the team (Krishna, Saroj, Niroj, Bijay, Subash) there and have gotten to know them personally very well. Just one month ago I was in Nepal to work and spend time with them trekking the Himalayas.Following Saturday's earthquake in Nepal, I offered to raise funds to send to Krishna and the team for them to use to directly aid the communities they live in, all badly affected by the disaster. My colleagues and their immediate families are all physically safe right now. They are now spending their time helping the people in their communities who have been affected more dramatically by the earthquake.I am creating this campaign to offer them easier, direct access to aid funds. Krishna says that no aid stations have been deployed where he lives, Bhaktapur (a few miles east of central Kathmandu) yet and he cannot feel the evidence of funds committed by foreign organizations or governments. At this time rescue work is done by the local inhabitants and the limited local police force, and water and food in Kathmandu is in limited supply.

Money raised from this campaign will be spent to get more emergency supplies to the people of Kathmandu from other areas of Nepal that were not as affected by the earthquake. (List of items: water, food, emergency medicines, necessity dry goods, blankets, and mattresses to sleep on the floor)

Whatever amount you can give will make a big difference. Also, I know how to send money to Nepal and I will cover transfer costs myself.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">More About the Use of CombForms™</span><br/>
</h3> <p>When bees draw comb naturally they fill all available areas of their hive until the space in the hive has been used. The combs are often curved and interlocked. This makes it impossible to easily inspect the hives for disease or harvest excess honey without causing severe damage to the comb and frequently killing quantities of bees. Although there are many variations on the beehive, all modern types of hives used throughout the world for bee culture have removable frames. Many beekeepers provide beeswax or artificial foundation which acts as a template for the cell pattern and cell base construction of wax comb in frames. CombForms™ are constructed so that bees are encouraged to construct wax in the frames into straight even combs with or without the use of foundation. They allow the workers, queen and drones to move through the hexagonal opening to other parts of the hive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433334549/jlhuqqiaoasb7b4l4pl8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Relative size of hexagon openings (queen - top, worker - left, drone - right) from CombForms™ provisional patent application</i></p>
<br/>
<p>Brood comb for raising new generations of bees is typically uniform in depth; whereas, honeycomb is frequently either over or under-built. Whenever one frame of honeycomb is overbuilt, it protrudes or bulges into the adjoining frame resulting in the adjacent frame being under-built, thin and convex or curved and locked into the next frame or even missing. Although not as severe a problem as curved comb, over-built and under-built comb can also result in frames being locked together. These irregularities on honeycomb may require repeated trimming until the comb irregularities have been reduced and the adjoining thin or missing frames of comb have been filled with a balanced amount of comb that completely fills the frame. When beekeepers have to deal with misshapen or irregular comb it requires extra time for trimming and can interfere or slow down the honey harvest by requiring extra labor for uncapping the under-built sections of the comb by hand. Trimming the over-built sections of the comb to the proper size means that the removed sections will require extra handling to separate the honey from the wax. After trimming the adjacent frame will have a void or under-built area of wax. The bees may continue to over-build the one side instead of completing the under -built area. CombForms™ guides the bees to fill the entire frame and helps establish the space between combs which is used by bees to move about the hive. Once this spacing is established the CombForm™ can be removed for use elsewhere and after sliding the frames together the bees do not construct additional comb into this ""bee space"".</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When beekeepers allow hived bees to construct their comb without the use of foundation as a template they typically use a starter strip at the top of the frame for the bees to begin their comb construction. In order to begin the construction of comb in an open cavity the bees will join together in an interlocking group that hangs from the top of the hive in a festoon. Combs constructed this way are quickly built - but the bees will sometimes</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> deviate from the starter strip and build crooked combs. In a worst case scenario the bees will build cross comb which is perpendicular to the direction desired by the beekeeper. This effectively locks the frames together so that separating the frames can substantially damage the comb and may consequently kill many bees. Constructing comb is an energy intensive activity with the bees having to use substantial amounts of carbohydrates in the form of nectar or supplied sugar water to make the wax. It has been reported that production of one pound of beeswax requires at least eight pounds of honey. This means that when the beekeeper must remove misshapen comb there will be a loss of honey since the bees will have to reconstruct the missing comb instead of having the excess honey available for storage. Using CombForms™ can mean the bees waste less energy on false starts that end up having to be </span>destroyed <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">by the beekeeper.</span></span></p>

<p>In his 1873 patent David Latchaw wrote:</p>
<blockquote>As a means of causing the bees to build comb with regularity, and to confine them to one frame til they have nearly or quite filled it, the guide R may be advantageously applied between the comb-frames. It is formed of muslin or other similar fabric, dipped in melted bees-wax. It has apertures like the wire gauze plate P, to permit the bees to pass through from one frame to the other, and support themselves during the commencement of the comb-building. When the comb has been commenced the plate R may be removed.</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When bees experience overcrowding within the hive they will respond by swarming. This is the natural way that honeybee colonies reproduce. Approximately half the bees in the hive will leave the hive along with the existing queen bee. This relieves the overcrowding and is the way that bees propagate new hives. When apiary hives swarm it results in a reduction in the amount of honey that can be harvested. The bees put their energy into making a new hive instead of producing honey. Recapturing the swarm is additional work for the beekeeper and may result in the swarm invading a populated area causing people to panic. There is a delicate balance that must be achieved by beekeepers that hope to harvest surplus honey from their bees. Strong hives are necessary to bring in enough nectar to make extra honey that can be harvested, but strong hives are more likely to swarm due to overcrowding of the brood box.</p>

<p><i>Lewis Aspinwall - 1908 Swarm Prevention Frame, Patent Number 891,584</i><br/></p>
<p>In 1897 Lewis Agustus Aspinwall patented a method of making bees feel like they had adequate room so they would focus their attention on honey production instead of swarming. Aspinwall's principle encouraged the bees to expand their hive upward into the empty honey supers that were place on top of the hive. </p>
<blockquote>In my present hive I employ similar brood or comb frames, and I prefer to arrange the same alternately with dummy frames that are filled in with a series of similar or parallel strips or slats. These slats may be placed in any desired direction and so close to one another as to leave between them about a bee-space, and the slats are preferably as wide as the dummy frames, and they are so close as to prevent the bees building comb in the frames, but yet at the same time allowing room for the bees to travel through the dummy frames from one comb frame to the next and in this way providing ample room for all the bees and for the increase of the bees, so as to overcome the tendency of the bees to swarm at certain periods.</blockquote>
<p>Placing three CombForms™ side-by-side at the edge of the brood ball creates the appropriate spacing and is hypothesized as another way to utilize the Aspinwall method for swarm prevention. Preliminary testing appears favorable; however, controlled trials supported by this crowd funding project are needed.  </p>

<p><b>How do I know CombForms<b>™</b> will work?</b></p>
<p>CombForms™ are a new tool based on past beekeeping methods. You should think of them as being in Beta testing. Although the results using CombForms™ has been favorable - their testing continues. Honeybee management practices vary and each hive has its own personality. Results using CombForms™ may vary. Users of CombForms™ do so at their own risk. If you are using CombForms™ it is important you monitor your hives to be sure it's working and communicating the message you intend to the bees. Additional information about using CombForms™ can be found on our website. We also encourage you to share your experiences on our blog. </p>

Each contribution of $60 will result in a set of seven CombForms™ to be shipped as a perk within the United States (International shipment of perks is extra). In order for this project to succeed we must raise a minimum of $65,000. 
This campaign has a strict deadline! This means that all contributions must be made through PayPal. You can use your own PayPal account or a credit card. Your contribution will be processed and the money held by PayPal until our campaign's deadline. If we do not reach our goal, PayPal promises to refund all contributions within 3-5 business days of the campaign's deadline.
We are counting on this project funding and moving forward according to the following schedule:
June 15, 2015 - Indiegogo Crowd Funding Campaign begins.
August 14, 2015 - Indiegogo Campaign closes. Injection Mold Design & Manufacture begins.
October 2015 - CombForm™ Fabrication.
November 2015 - Final shipment of perks. It is our goal to have the first 1,400 sets of CombForms™ perks in beekeepers hands so they can be used to test overwintering hives in many areas in the Northern Hemisphere. This time-frame will hopefully allow some production season testing in the Southern Hemisphere to begin in the 2015 season.
By contributing you are accepting some risks - we are required to notify you that we will make a best effort to provide the reward but delivery is not guaranteed. We do not anticipate it, but unanticipated delays may also occur.

 Overages

In the event this Indiegogo campaign exceeds $65,000 the overage may be used for a variety of projects to provide further testing and help bring CombForms™ to market as well as continue our own research and development.
The initial run of CombForms™ will be sized to fit Langstroth Deep Hives. If there is an overage we will be evaluating what other size CombForms™ we should offer. It is possible for you to cut CombForms™ down to fit some other types of hives such as Langstroth medium or shallow hives, Warre, and Top Bar Hives; however, It would be far better for us to be able to manufacture a variety of sizes since trimming CombForms™ would weaken them by having to cut through the reinforcing structure. If there is an overage, then additional sizes would be evaluated on a case by case basis to determine if there is sufficient interest to warrant the manufacture of those other sizes.
   
More About the Use of CombForms™
 When bees draw comb naturally they fill all available areas of their hive until the space in the hive has been used. The combs are often curved and interlocked. This makes it impossible to easily inspect the hives for disease or harvest excess honey without causing severe damage to the comb and frequently killing quantities of bees. Although there are many variations on the beehive, all modern types of hives used throughout the world for bee culture have removable frames. Many beekeepers provide beeswax or artificial foundation which acts as a template for the cell pattern and cell base construction of wax comb in frames. CombForms™ are constructed so that bees are encouraged to construct wax in the frames into straight even combs with or without the use of foundation. They allow the workers, queen and drones to move through the hexagonal opening to other parts of the hive.


Relative size of hexagon openings (queen - top, worker - left, drone - right) from CombForms™ provisional patent application

Brood comb for raising new generations of bees is typically uniform in depth; whereas, honeycomb is frequently either over or under-built. Whenever one frame of honeycomb is overbuilt, it protrudes or bulges into the adjoining frame resulting in the adjacent frame being under-built, thin and convex or curved and locked into the next frame or even missing. Although not as severe a problem as curved comb, over-built and under-built comb can also result in frames being locked together. These irregularities on honeycomb may require repeated trimming until the comb irregularities have been reduced and the adjoining thin or missing frames of comb have been filled with a balanced amount of comb that completely fills the frame. When beekeepers have to deal with misshapen or irregular comb it requires extra time for trimming and can interfere or slow down the honey harvest by requiring extra labor for uncapping the under-built sections of the comb by hand. Trimming the over-built sections of the comb to the proper size means that the removed sections will require extra handling to separate the honey from the wax. After trimming the adjacent frame will have a void or under-built area of wax. The bees may continue to over-build the one side instead of completing the under -built area. CombForms™ guides the bees to fill the entire frame and helps establish the space between combs which is used by bees to move about the hive. Once this spacing is established the CombForm™ can be removed for use elsewhere and after sliding the frames together the bees do not construct additional comb into this ""bee space"".
When beekeepers allow hived bees to construct their comb without the use of foundation as a template they typically use a starter strip at the top of the frame for the bees to begin their comb construction. In order to begin the construction of comb in an open cavity the bees will join together in an interlocking group that hangs from the top of the hive in a festoon. Combs constructed this way are quickly built - but the bees will sometimes deviate from the starter strip and build crooked combs. In a worst case scenario the bees will build cross comb which is perpendicular to the direction desired by the beekeeper. This effectively locks the frames together so that separating the frames can substantially damage the comb and may consequently kill many bees. Constructing comb is an energy intensive activity with the bees having to use substantial amounts of carbohydrates in the form of nectar or supplied sugar water to make the wax. It has been reported that production of one pound of beeswax requires at least eight pounds of honey. This means that when the beekeeper must remove misshapen comb there will be a loss of honey since the bees will have to reconstruct the missing comb instead of having the excess honey available for storage. Using CombForms™ can mean the bees waste less energy on false starts that end up having to be destroyed by the beekeeper.


Six possible methods of using CombForms™




Past Inventions Leading to CombForms™ 
CombForms™ has benefited from a study of the designs and practices of historical 
methods.

In his 1873 patent David Latchaw wrote:
As a means of causing the bees to build comb with regularity, and to confine them to one frame til they have nearly or quite filled it, the guide R may be advantageously applied between the comb-frames. It is formed of muslin or other similar fabric, dipped in melted bees-wax. It has apertures like the wire gauze plate P, to permit the bees to pass through from one frame to the other, and support themselves during the commencement of the comb-building. When the comb has been commenced the plate R may be removed.

When bees experience overcrowding within the hive they will respond by swarming. This is the natural way that honeybee colonies reproduce. Approximately half the bees in the hive will leave the hive along with the existing queen bee. This relieves the overcrowding and is the way that bees propagate new hives. When apiary hives swarm it results in a reduction in the amount of honey that can be harvested. The bees put their energy into making a new hive instead of producing honey. Recapturing the swarm is additional work for the beekeeper and may result in the swarm invading a populated area causing people to panic. There is a delicate balance that must be achieved by beekeepers that hope to harvest surplus honey from their bees. Strong hives are necessary to bring in enough nectar to make extra honey that can be harvested, but strong hives are more likely to swarm due to overcrowding of the brood box.


Lewis Aspinwall - 1908 Swarm Prevention Frame, Patent Number 891,584
In 1897 Lewis Agustus Aspinwall patented a method of making bees feel like they had adequate room so they would focus their attention on honey production instead of swarming. Aspinwall's principle encouraged the bees to expand their hive upward into the empty honey supers that were place on top of the hive. 
In my present hive I employ similar brood or comb frames, and I prefer to arrange the same alternately with dummy frames that are filled in with a series of similar or parallel strips or slats. These slats may be placed in any desired direction and so close to one another as to leave between them about a bee-space, and the slats are preferably as wide as the dummy frames, and they are so close as to prevent the bees building comb in the frames, but yet at the same time allowing room for the bees to travel through the dummy frames from one comb frame to the next and in this way providing ample room for all the bees and for the increase of the bees, so as to overcome the tendency of the bees to swarm at certain periods.
Placing three CombForms™ side-by-side at the edge of the brood ball creates the appropriate spacing and is hypothesized as another way to utilize the Aspinwall method for swarm prevention. Preliminary testing appears favorable; however, controlled trials supported by this crowd funding project are needed.  



How You Can Help With Our Research
Shortly after we begin shipping CombForms™ as perks, we 
intend to add to our web-site a number of Crowd Science Projects to ask your help to figure out best practices. We fully expect that some ways of using CombForms™ 
may end up sending bees the wrong message. By participating in our Crowd Source 
research project we hope to learn even more about communicating our desires to 
the bees and understanding when the bees tell us Yes and No!
This section of our web-site and the research project 
proposal synopsis are under development, but you can help us right now by going 
to the Research section of our website www.combforms.com and letting us know your thoughts on 
what types of Combforms™ questions you would like to see studied.


FAQs
How Can I Order A Set Of CombForms™?
Right now, the only way to get CombForms™ is through our
Indiegogo page. People who contribute to the project on Indiegogo, will get the
first CombForms's as perks.
When Will I Receive My Perk?

When you make your contributions it is time stamped by
Indiegogo. Your perk will be shipped on a first come, first served basis. This
means that the first backers will get their CombForms™ perk first,
according to when the orders were received. We anticipate that we may get some
perks out by the end of October but some of the first fourteen hundred orders will
ship at the beginning of November 2015. If more than fourteen hundred persons contribute those perks
may take longer - but will continue to be shipped in order. Approximate shipping
date information will also be posted on our web-site at www.combforms.com. 

How do I know CombForms™ will work?
CombForms™ are a new tool based on past beekeeping methods. You should think of them as being in Beta testing. Although the results using CombForms™ has been favorable - their testing continues. Honeybee management practices vary and each hive has its own personality. Results using CombForms™ may vary. Users of CombForms™ do so at their own risk. If you are using CombForms™ it is important you monitor your hives to be sure it's working and communicating the message you intend to the bees. Additional information about using CombForms™ can be found on our website. We also encourage you to share your experiences on our blog. 

What If I Have a Problem With My Order?
Just go to the top right of the Indiegogo page and click on
""Your Name"" and ""Contact User"".  This is how you notify us about changes to
your orders, such as address changes. If your problem requires Indiegogo or
PayPal involvement we will send you to their customer service.

So if I can raise the money I will also be giving back some fairly substantial awards. Anything from a t-shirt and koozie all the way up to an all inclusive charter fishing trip of your choice will be given back depending on the amount of money donated. Also, every donator will be entered in a raffle to win 1 of 3 custom rods built by me personally for you.</p>

It helps keep foods fresh for longer periods of time, resulting in reduced food expenses as less will need to be thrown away.We believe that this new appliance will be just as useful in the kitchen as an oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, induction hub… we think it’s practicality and usefulness will make it the 5th electrical appliance that we all want to have in our kitchen, because it prevents food from being wasted and therefore allows families to SAVE money.

**********************************

The Story 

 
How did a passion for the arts, turn into a passion for dogs? The story of Pee Poop Play is quite amazing. My name is Andre Lambert, founder and owner of the Boston based dog walking company Pee Poop Play. A life long resident of Boston, I went from a student of the arts, to teacher of the arts. Somewhere along that journey, I got a dog; a decision that would eventually change everything. 



I now run a highly rated company that wants to give back to a community that has been so great to us! We value the relationships and enrichment involved with dog socialization. We are firm believers in the ""power of community"". PPP strives to be the magnet that brings this amazing doggie community together.





The Master Plan :)


From the beginning, the goal of Pee Poop Play has been to provide quality care and expert service to our clients. We have built and continue to build amazing relationships with our clients and their dogs. Our ultimate dream has been to open a doggie daycare. We want to extend our expertise and love for dogs to the community of Jamaica Plain and beyond. This doggie daycare will provide ample space for exercise, socialization and training. We believe these 3 things are the foundation for a healthy, balanced and happy dog. We like to make dogs HAPPY! Our goal is to lease and transform the old JP Variety Store into a state of the art facility for dogs. 


Your contribution to this project will help us to secure the lease and make the necessary improvements to the space. It will also help us reach out to the surrounding community of dog owners, trainers, artist, designers and animal advocates.

The Location 

Located on the corner of Rosemary and South st. The old JP Variety Store is vacant and up for lease. At 1,400+ square feet, this space would make an excellent daycare, and would also provide much needed services to Jamaica Plain and the surrounding neighborhoods. We believe Pee Poop Play would be a welcomed addition to the creative energy and eclectic spirt of JP. The community of Jamaica Plain also has Boston's highest concentration of dog owners.

   The Funds 



-------------------------------------------------------------------

Lets Break it Down


Our goal is to raise $60,000 dollars. We believe this amount is necessary to complete the project. For this reason, we have chosen to elect 'Fixed Funding' for this campaign. If we are not able to raise 60K in the allotted time, all donations will be returned to our backers by Indiegogo. Pee Poop Play is fully committed to the vision. We don't believe in wasting time or resources. We are honored you took the time to hear our story. 


Here is what your contribution will help us achieve.





The rent for this building is $3,000 per month. To secure the lease we will need to pay first, last and security.  Total $9,000

This is the most important and time sensitive step for this project. This space is currently open for any business to make an offer. We have reached out to the building owners; they LOVE our idea and are rooting for us. However, until we can secure the lease, we are in competition with all interested parties. 


 


To fully utilize and maximize the impact of this great space, the interior and exterior design is critical. Below is the break down of  the proposed design budget.

ARCHITECT
This one is an absolute must; without one we can not secure the proper permits from the city. The architect will help us to properly and professionally draw out the interior renovation plans.



INTERIOR DESIGNER

 We want to maximize the space for both dogs and humans. We also want it to look cool :) An interior designer will help with furniture sourcing and layout. They will also help source the right materials for the overall look of the daycare. 



MURALIST 
This one is very close to our hearts. Art brings value and character to any space. We want the interior and exterior walls to be both inspiring and inviting to our neighbors and customers.


Assembling these experts will run us an estimated $7,000 





From dry wall and screws; to flooring, lighting and signage. There is no building with out them. The estimated cost for materials will be close to $8,000 






There is an old carpenters saying 'Measure twice, cut once'. Every second over our projected building schedule will cost us money. Hiring the right commercial contractor, electrician, and plumber will help us to reach our goal swiftly and safely.

</div><h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal;""><br/></h3></div>","About Us
My name is Eva Vega. I am the proud mom of a child with Autism (ASD) and the Founder of THYME and play. THYME and play is a social venture that focuses on creating sensory-friendly dining experiences for families who have members with special needs. THYME and play is looking to raise funds on this platform to transform our commercial building into a restaurant space. 

What is THYME and play?Located in the heart of South Carolina, THYME and play will be an upscale, farm-to-table restaurant that specializes in sensory-friendly environments, allergy-sensitive menus, custom dining room, and play areas designed for children and adults with physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities. 

THYME and play has the potential to change the restaurant industry to be more inclusive to all people. Every donation made in support of this project will fund renovations, equipment, and adaptive spaces needed to turn this restaurant into a reality. 
  What We Need & What You Get

Here is where we need the funds to go:
$15,000 will go to Adaptive Play Equipment:
$85,000 will help us out with building renovations

Because we want to show how much we really appreciate everyone who donates to our campaign, our team has put together a few perks to sweeten the deal. Sure we have simple things like stickers, T-shirts, and thank you notes, but it's the big perks that we are the most excited about. The $200 perk, $500 perk, and the $1000 perk are our special way to say THANK YOU for what you are doing. It is just our small gesture to HONOR you for believing in the idea and concept of THYME and play.    

Why Should You Care?
According to current information from Census.gov and other reputable sources, 1 out of every 5 people living in America will have a disability, 1 in 45 will be labeled with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and 1 out of 3 people with Autism will suffer from isolation. 
Families with disabilities want a social outlet that is safe, and understanding, but that just isn't available right now where we live. The restaurant industry hasn't really prioritized the needs and wants of this specific target market. With your help, THYME and play will be afforded the opportunity to reach an under-served demographic and change the way the restaurant industry views children with disabilities. With every dollar donated, Thyme and play will get one step closer to real inclusivity, and disability awareness. 

What If We Don't Meet Our Goal?This crowdfunding campaign will be combined with other fund-raising efforts to reach our end goal. If by chance our need is not met here, the money will go into a an account that will be used only to fund the development of this restaurant. We will continue to fundraise, bootstrap, and go door-to-door (if we have to), to make this restaurant concept a reality. 

Thank You!

This dream isn't possible without the love and support of people like you. We just want you to know that this means everything to us. Being Different is Ok, and you guys get it!

<h3> Hello, My name is Dawn , it is nice to meet you!</h3>
<p>I have 20+ years experience working in the salon industry and 12+ years as a salon owner in NC. I am currently living in FL operating a cute litte online bookstore on Etsy, here is the link: <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/OldnewbooksShop?ref=search_shop_redirect"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.etsy.com/shop/OldnewbooksShop?ref=s...</a></p>
<p>I would like to move back towards NC and purchase a bilevel home , putting a one chair hair studio in the basement and my bookstore in the garage. </p>
<p>This will cost approximately 375,000.00 due to the fact, that I would like to pay cash upfront for the land and furnishings and tools and and all the other little details, utilities, cost of moving , etc. and still have a little cushion in the bank. I have a digital print of a painting I did called Lemons and it can be purchased here for $4.00 <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/930493093/lemons-digital-art?ref=shop_home_active_92&amp;pro=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.etsy.com/listing/930493093/lemons-d...</a></p>
<p>If 200,000.00 people would purchase one copy of my digital print, I will have enough money to make this happen and I would owe you no money as you would be getting a digital print in exchange for $4.00 and right now it is 50% off as well as all of my books.</p>
<p>Thair studio will attract clients who are not interested in harsh chemicals as there will be NO services for perms, color, or keratin treatments and only haircuts. Each hair cut will cost $15.00 for children, $18.00 for men, $22.00 for women wet cuts, $35.00 for women short hair with blow-dry and style, $45.00 for women with medium hair blow-dry and style, $55.00 for women with long thick hair with blow-dry and style.</p>
<p>This little hair studio will make an impact on the planet due to no waste, harsh chemicals, and no retail sales, as everything is avaialble online now and more cost effective to purchase online direct for clients than it is for salon owners to purchase and resale. This will be a Hair Cutting and Styling only studio.</p>
<p>There are no risks, the house, land will be paid for, I am really good at what I do and I love my job. Opertating a salon is almost effortless for me as well as maintaining a clientel.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking an interest in my business plan and please use the indegogo tools to bring me buyers!</p>

<p>Ever wanted to go out with your friends to a restaurant or a café, to watch your favourite e-sports team win the championships? And while doing so be immersed in the same world of your favourite video game?</p>
<p> We are two regular gamers who go by the names of Arthur and Intars and who want to bring this kind of experience to you! While working as cooks and chefs in the food industry for several years, we also have been passionate gamers. Our dream is to bring these two worlds together so we could enjoy the best of both.</p>
<p>Cafe / Restaurant Side Quest will be based in Riga, Latvia. If you are a foreigner, why should you care? Well starting off, this will give you a great incentive to visit our beautiful country, although you probably never heard about it before. But mostly the success of this project might inspire people around the world to start up similar businesses. E-sports and gaming industry in general ar growing and growing fast. It is only natural we take a part in it. There are so many sports bars but almost none cover e-sports, so lets change this together!</p>
<p>The money we need wont cover all of the expenses, but it sure will show potential investors that people are interested in this kind of establishment. Of course we do want to be as independent as possible, so every bit that is contributed above the asking goal, is a step closer to independency. It will allow us to truly fulfill our own vision.</p>

A place where you could boast about your virtual conquests with tankard full of ale in your hand or chances are your favourite e-sports team is competing in championships and you want to watch them play with your friends in a place that has this great fantasy atmosphere. Place that resembles those famous inns you have visited in your virtual travels, like Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire or one of those taverns in the Witcher universe.</div><p>Foods and drinks will be inspired by videogames. Looks, ingredients and names will closely resemble the things you have seen and experienced behind the screen, but this time it will be a reality. Now you can finally have a taste of the infamous sweetroll, just be careful because somebody might steal it!

<p>Money we need will act more as a proof for our creditors or investors, that we have starting capital and potential clients. They need to see that people are interested in this kind of project.</p>
<p>Of course these will mean that we can't really be independent, but every cent we go above, will be a step towards more independent business model. So even if a miracle happens and we will manage to reach the goal, we encourage you to keep contributing so we could keep improving this project.</p>
<p>All contributions will of course go towards regular expenses of a restaurant - rent, bills, equipment etc.</p>
<p>For encouragement we have added several interesting perks to the contributors. You can see them below.</p>

Ever wanted to go out with your friends to a restaurant or a café, to watch your favourite e-sports team win the championships? And while doing so be immersed in the same world of your favourite video game?
 We are two regular gamers who go by the names of Arthur and Intars and who want to bring this kind of experience to you! While working as cooks and chefs in the food industry for several years, we also have been passionate gamers. Our dream is to bring these two worlds together so we could enjoy the best of both.
Cafe / Restaurant Side Quest will be based in Riga, Latvia. If you are a foreigner, why should you care? Well starting off, this will give you a great incentive to visit our beautiful country, although you probably never heard about it before. But mostly the success of this project might inspire people around the world to start up similar businesses. E-sports and gaming industry in general ar growing and growing fast. It is only natural we take a part in it. There are so many sports bars but almost none cover e-sports, so lets change this together!
The money we need wont cover all of the expenses, but it sure will show potential investors that people are interested in this kind of establishment. Of course we do want to be as independent as possible, so every bit that is contributed above the asking goal, is a step closer to independency. It will allow us to truly fulfill our own vision.
 

 About the concept Idea is to bring parts of gaming worlds to life in our café / restaurant. A place where you could boast about your virtual conquests with tankard full of ale in your hand or chances are your favourite e-sports team is competing in championships and you want to watch them play with your friends in a place that has this great fantasy atmosphere. Place that resembles those famous inns you have visited in your virtual travels, like Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire or one of those taverns in the Witcher universe.Foods and drinks will be inspired by videogames. Looks, ingredients and names will closely resemble the things you have seen and experienced behind the screen, but this time it will be a reality. Now you can finally have a taste of the infamous sweetroll, just be careful because somebody might steal it! Or if you're thirsty try on of our cocktail potions or some really nice locally brewed ale. Our version of lembas bread. Remember buzzard wings form your travels in Azeroth? Or maybe Kaldorei Spider Kabob? Interior of our restaurant will be themed like a medieval tavern with a touch of fantasy.Concept picture taken from: artstation.com       About funding and perks  
Money we need will act more as a proof for our creditors or investors, that we have starting capital and potential clients. They need to see that people are interested in this kind of project.
Of course these will mean that we can't really be independent, but every cent we go above, will be a step towards more independent business model. So even if a miracle happens and we will manage to reach the goal, we encourage you to keep contributing so we could keep improving this project.
All contributions will of course go towards regular expenses of a restaurant - rent, bills, equipment etc.
For encouragement we have added several interesting perks to the contributors. You can see them below.
 

 
If we won't reach our goal, contributed amount will still be used as starting capital to start this project and all the claimed perks will be fulfilled.

As a San Diegan, I often found myself trying to figure out which form of entertainment I would love to be a part of next. I remember wondering how I could experience a different part of San Diego while also having a fun time with my friends and feel more connected to my community. The county, as I know it, is a very diverse place and it’s where I spent most of my life. I have enjoyed seeing the different cultures in every city around San Diego and I believe that Cinematic Adventures will be an exciting addition to the nightlife around the county.</p><p> In 2011 I began event coordinating as a senior at Vista High School. As the Executive Secretary, I hosted themed events that raised money for every club on campus several times a year. In 2013 I began to work on short films and found my passion for storytelling. I continued to produced projects in school and after graduating from Palomar College in 2015, I transferred to California State University, Northridge. I was accepted into a competitive film production program where I have used my education to focus on producing. The highlight of my education began this year as I produced a short film that cost nearly twenty-five thousand to make. My most current work involves managing and event coordinating for a J.Crew retail store. </p><p>In the two short years that I’ve lived in Los Angeles, there have been many experiences I will never forget, and Cinematic Adventures is an experience I am fortunate to share with you. You might be wondering what exactly Cinematic Adventures is and how it will help the community. What our company hopes to accomplish is stimulate the community and explore different parts of the county. We are providing San Diego with an opportunity to taste an array of great foods from local vendors that have worked hard to build their business in the very city we host events in. It is also an occasion for artisans and local businesses to take part in our event as well, to show off their work. Since we will be in a new city every Saturday, a part of our plan is to offer sponsorship and partnership packages to vendors and small businesses who want to reach a new audience. While our events will begin in the evenings, attendees will have the leisure to pick a spot on the field, relax, get to know locals, enjoy food and finish their night with a movie exhibition.</p><p>Our vision is to host fundraisers for local clubs, schools, college programs, fraternities, and sororities. We are dedicated to giving back and plan to raise funds for numerous foundations and scholarships that best represent our community. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>We are trying to achieving our goal to highlight the value of each community we host events in.

Our company will highlight local businesses, drive traffic to different areas around the county, host fundraisers, and donate to foundations and scholarships. We are giving back to a community that has helped us begin our Cinematic Adventure. A service built by the community, for the community. </p><p><br/><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong><br/>           As any crowdfunding campaign, there is the possibility that we may not obtain the full amount we are hoping to achieve. IF we are in a position where we must budget for a smaller event (or even fewer events), then we will make sure to use the money for marketing and carrying through with the first couple events. <br/>         With the producing experience and event coordinating knowledge I have, there is always a way to work things out.

As a San Diegan, I often found myself trying to figure out which form of entertainment I would love to be a part of next. I remember wondering how I could experience a different part of San Diego while also having a fun time with my friends and feel more connected to my community. The county, as I know it, is a very diverse place and it’s where I spent most of my life. I have enjoyed seeing the different cultures in every city around San Diego and I believe that Cinematic Adventures will be an exciting addition to the nightlife around the county. In 2011 I began event coordinating as a senior at Vista High School. As the Executive Secretary, I hosted themed events that raised money for every club on campus several times a year. In 2013 I began to work on short films and found my passion for storytelling. I continued to produced projects in school and after graduating from Palomar College in 2015, I transferred to California State University, Northridge. I was accepted into a competitive film production program where I have used my education to focus on producing. The highlight of my education began this year as I produced a short film that cost nearly twenty-five thousand to make. My most current work involves managing and event coordinating for a J.Crew retail store. In the two short years that I’ve lived in Los Angeles, there have been many experiences I will never forget, and Cinematic Adventures is an experience I am fortunate to share with you. You might be wondering what exactly Cinematic Adventures is and how it will help the community. What our company hopes to accomplish is stimulate the community and explore different parts of the county. We are providing San Diego with an opportunity to taste an array of great foods from local vendors that have worked hard to build their business in the very city we host events in. It is also an occasion for artisans and local businesses to take part in our event as well, to show off their work. Since we will be in a new city every Saturday, a part of our plan is to offer sponsorship and partnership packages to vendors and small businesses who want to reach a new audience. While our events will begin in the evenings, attendees will have the leisure to pick a spot on the field, relax, get to know locals, enjoy food and finish their night with a movie exhibition.Our vision is to host fundraisers for local clubs, schools, college programs, fraternities, and sororities. We are dedicated to giving back and plan to raise funds for numerous foundations and scholarships that best represent our community.  What We Need & What You GetWe are trying to achieving our goal to highlight the value of each community we host events in.

The Impact   Your contribution to this project helps young entrepreneurs build a foundation for their future. Our company will highlight local businesses, drive traffic to different areas around the county, host fundraisers, and donate to foundations and scholarships. We are giving back to a community that has helped us begin our Cinematic Adventure. A service built by the community, for the community. Risks & Challenges           As any crowdfunding campaign, there is the possibility that we may not obtain the full amount we are hoping to achieve. IF we are in a position where we must budget for a smaller event (or even fewer events), then we will make sure to use the money for marketing and carrying through with the first couple events.          With the producing experience and event coordinating knowledge I have, there is always a way to work things out. I believe that no matter what the outcome is, we will fulfill our goals and achieve the best for Cinematic Adventures. We will rent our equipment for the time length of time it would be necessary to raise enough funds to get a professional screen. In our first month of promoting this campaign, we are going to contact journalists from local newspapers, news stations and even radio hosts to possibly report on our company.  Other Ways You Can Help          We appreciate your contributions, both small and large.

<p>Hello my name is Tord. </p>
<p>Our house (Villa) is in need of renovating so we can help more children and youths, hopefully be able to expand from the current four, to a total of eight clients.</p>
<p>Fact: In Sweden we currently have fairly huge problems whit many young people who have lived a hard life, mostly outside of society. Also whit youths who come from countries like Syria with a civil war, close to many serious problems. Youths that have all lived a hard life outside a society that all too often failed them in almost every way.</p>
<p>Short how it works: After an investigation, our Social services place the young people in an approved stable family home, where they can live without drama, problems or risk of negligence or abuse, and where they around the clock have access to adequate help and support and our home is such a home.</p>
<p>We see that they youth behave, learn to eat at fixed times, don’t use drugs etz. That he or she goes to and home directly from school, take care of homework and anything else they often may need social guidance with. Like learning to cook, make the bed, wash clothes and learn to take care and responsibility of their health and their own life, and other things that we sometimes take for granted that everyone know. </p>
<p>I get paid, of course, but just so that it goes around, not improve. Hence, I hope you can help me to help more. Primary we need to renovate our two smaller bedrooms,  also get our two bathrooms remodel so every sex has a own space without creating any friction. <br/><br/>Any small help is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks all and you have a great day.<br/><br/>Cincerely yours.. / Tord</p>

<p>About
us<b> </b></p>
<p>My name is Nikola
Barbarić and I am a fitness coach. Two years ago I opened a field hockey
club, first of a kind in Dalmatia and in any marine town in Europe. It all started
in our sport school for children where we teach children various sports. Among
them, we decided to play hockey with them. I was very interested in sport so I started
to study rules and techniques. I called Croatian Hockey Alliance and their
director, mister Slaven Zlatar, invited me at hockey couches seminar. I came
back in my home town with a certificate and opened a hockey club.</p>

<p><b>Our
beginings</b></p>
<p>A lot of people laughed and said
that it won't work because in Dalmatia people don't know about hockey and there
never existed a club. Little by little, they started to gather. First players
started to gather their friends and
family . We were thirty very soon and we started to leave a visible mark. We
organized a first hockey match in Split after 36 years (the last one was at
Meditteranian games in Split), we won third place at international tournament
in Poreč and fifth place at Zlatar memorial in Zagreb, we brought Croatian
National Hockey Cup in Split.</p>

<p><b>Our current projects and plans</b></p>
<p>I have just
returned from Netherlands where I have been with coach Luka Androja.
We went there to learn more about hockey techniques and to learn more how to
manage a club. People from Oosterbeek nad England came to our town to have a
hockey course for nine young trainers. We have a support of very large amount
of people so we already have a fan group who have their song and a transparent.
We want to promote a hockey in Dalmatia, we want to inspire people to play
hockey and to open a hockey club so that we have opponents to play against. We also
want to start a group  for children with Down Syndrom and for woman.<br/></p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Problems we deal with </b></p>
<p>Problem is
that we don't have an adequate place for trainig, neither indoor, neither
outdoor. We don't have an opponents to play against if we don't travel which we
are not in financial possibility. We don't have our Clubhouse, nor a hockey
pitch where we can play nor a specific hockey equipment necessary to play with.
We need money to rent a place and turn it into our clubhouse, a place for
socializing and fun, to set a hockey pitch, to buy an equipment and to travel
to competitions.</p>

<br/><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Hrvatska verzija: </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>O
nama</b></p>
<p>Moje ime je Nikola
Barbarić i po struci sam viši kondicijski trener. Prije dvije godine otvorio
sam klub hokeja na travi, prvi takav klub u Dalmaciji i uopće u nekom
primorskom gradu u Europi. Sve je počelo u našoj univerzalnoj sportskoj školi
gdje s djecom treniramo petnaestak sportova. Jednog smo dana pokušali zaigrati
hokej. Sam sport izrazito me je zainteresirao te sam počeo proučavati pravila i
tehnike. Nazvao sam Hrvatski hokej savez, čiji me je direktor, gospodin Slaven
Zlatar, oduševljen pozivom s mora, pozvao na seminar za hokej trenere u Zagreb.
Završio sam seminar, vratio se u svoj rodni kraj s diplomom u ruci te otvorio
prvi klub hokeja na travi. </p>
<p><b>Početci
našega kluba</b></p>
<p>Mnogi su mi se smijali
i govorili da to neće ići jer ljudi u Dalmaciji ne znaju za hokej jer nikada
nije postajao niti jedan hokej klub. Malo po malo, ipak su se počeli okupljati.
Svi novi članovi počeli su okupljati svoje prijatelje, kumove, rođake, braću itd. Skupilo
nas se tridesetak i ubrzo smo počeli ostavljati vidljiv trag. Organizirali smo
prvu hokej utakmicu u Splitu nakon 36 godina (zadnja je bila na Mediteranskim
igrama u Splitu), osvojili treće mjesto na međunarodnom turniru u Poreču, peto
mjesto na Zlatarovom turniru u Zagrebu, doveli Hokej Kup Republike Hrvatske u
Split. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Mediji</b></p>
<p>Mediji su nas
oduševljeno popratili te su novine i portali bili puni članaka o novopečenim
hokejašima, više puta u ovih godinu dana, nego je hokej u Republici Hrvatskoj
imao medijskog prostora ikad. </p>
<p><b>Trenutni
projekti<span>  i planovi našega kluba</span></b></p>
<p>Nedavno sam bio,
zajedno sa trenerom Lukom Androjom, na putovanju u Nizozmskoj, na razmjernu
iskustava<span>  s hokej klubom u Oosterbeeku.
Također su ljudi iz Oosterbeeka i Engleske došli u Hrvatsku, u Split, podučiti
nas tehnikama i držanju hokeja treninga. 
Devet mladih momaka položilo je tečaj za hokej trenere, u Hrvatsku
su došli vodeći ljudi za hokej u Europi održati taj isti tečaj. Imamo podršku
jako velikog broja ljudi tako da se okupila i navijačka skupina koja ima svoju
himnu, zastavu i transparent. Želja nam je promovirati hokej u Dalmaciji tako
da se otvori još koji klub kako bismo mogli igrati s njima i kako bismo mogli
imati ligu. Također od jeseni planiramo pokrenuti grupu za djecu s Downovim
Sindromom i za žene. </span></p>
<p><span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Problemi
s kojima se susrećemo</b></p>
<p>Problem nam je
nedostatak adekvatnog prostora za trening, bilo dvoranskog, bilo travnatog.
Nemamo protiv koga igrati ako ne putujemo, što nismo u financijskoj mogućnosti.
Nemamo ni naš Clubhouse ni travnjak ni specifičnu hokej opremu. Potreban nam je
novac kako bismo mogli iznajmiti prostor i pretvoriti ga u naš Clubhouse, naše
mjesto druženja i okupljanja, zatim kako bismo mogli postaviti travnjak, kupiti
speifičnu hokej opremu te putovati na natjecanja. </p>
<p><b>Potreban
novac</b></p>
<p>Potrebno nam je  15000 $<br/></p>
<p>Taj bismo novac potrošili
za:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>godišnji najam prostora:  3000 $ </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>instalacije struje:  1500 $<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>instalacije vode: 1500 $<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>obnova zidova, podova i stropova: 1500 $<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>sanitarni čvorovi (4 wc-a s tuševima): 1500 $<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>namještaj (stolovi i stolice za clubhouse kafić,
stolovi i stolice za dnevni prostror): 750 $<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>sportski rekviziti:  750 $<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>elektronička oprema (laptop, zvučnici, projektor):
750 $<br/></p>
<p><span><span>·<span> 
</span></span></span><span>kupnju kombija: 3750 $ </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Drugi načini na koje nam možete
pomoći</span></b></p>
<p><span>Ukoliko
nam niste u mogućosti pomoći financijski, nema veze. Tu su drugi načini na koje
možete doprinijeti. Podijelite ovu kampanju sa svojim prijateljima i obitelji
kako bi što veći broj ljudi za nju čuo. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dovedimo zajedno hokej u Dalmaciju!</p>

organized a first hockey match in Split after 36 years (the last one was at
Meditteranian games in Split), we won third place at international tournament
in Poreč and fifth place at Zlatar memorial in Zagreb, we brought Croatian
National Hockey Cup in Split.









Media 
The media
enthusiastically accompanied us so that newspapers and internet portals were
full of articles about hockey players.
More than ever, hockey found it's place in media.


Twinning project in NetherlandsHockey story from Dalmatia






Our current projects and plans
I have just
returned from Netherlands where I have been with coach Luka Androja.
We went there to learn more about hockey techniques and to learn more how to
manage a club. People from Oosterbeek nad England came to our town to have a
hockey course for nine young trainers. We have a support of very large amount
of people so we already have a fan group who have their song and a transparent.
We want to promote a hockey in Dalmatia, we want to inspire people to play
hockey and to open a hockey club so that we have opponents to play against. We also
want to start a group  for children with Down Syndrom and for woman.






Problems we deal with 
Problem is
that we don't have an adequate place for trainig, neither indoor, neither
outdoor. We don't have an opponents to play against if we don't travel which we
are not in financial possibility. We don't have our Clubhouse, nor a hockey
pitch where we can play nor a specific hockey equipment necessary to play with.
We need money to rent a place and turn it into our clubhouse, a place for
socializing and fun, to set a hockey pitch, to buy an equipment and to travel
to competitions.





Necessary amount of money
We need
15000 $ that we would use for:
· 
Annual rent of a place: 3000 $
· 
Electricity installation: 1500 $ 
· 
Water installation: 1500 $
· 
Renewal of walls, ceiling and floor: 1500 $
· 
Bathrooms with showers; 1500 $
· 
Furniture: 750 $
· 
Sports equipment; 750 $
· 
Electronic equipment: 750 $
· 
Buying a van: 3750 $
Other ways you can help
If you are
not in possibility to help us financially, there are other ways to help. You
can share this campaign with your friends and family so that more people hear about
it. 
Let's bring hockey in
Dalmatia together! 


Hrvatska verzija: 

O
nama
Moje ime je Nikola
Barbarić i po struci sam viši kondicijski trener. Prije dvije godine otvorio
sam klub hokeja na travi, prvi takav klub u Dalmaciji i uopće u nekom
primorskom gradu u Europi. Sve je počelo u našoj univerzalnoj sportskoj školi
gdje s djecom treniramo petnaestak sportova. Jednog smo dana pokušali zaigrati
hokej. Sam sport izrazito me je zainteresirao te sam počeo proučavati pravila i
tehnike. Nazvao sam Hrvatski hokej savez, čiji me je direktor, gospodin Slaven
Zlatar, oduševljen pozivom s mora, pozvao na seminar za hokej trenere u Zagreb.
Završio sam seminar, vratio se u svoj rodni kraj s diplomom u ruci te otvorio
prvi klub hokeja na travi. 
Početci
našega kluba
Mnogi su mi se smijali
i govorili da to neće ići jer ljudi u Dalmaciji ne znaju za hokej jer nikada
nije postajao niti jedan hokej klub. Malo po malo, ipak su se počeli okupljati.
Svi novi članovi počeli su okupljati svoje prijatelje, kumove, rođake, braću itd. Skupilo
nas se tridesetak i ubrzo smo počeli ostavljati vidljiv trag. Organizirali smo
prvu hokej utakmicu u Splitu nakon 36 godina (zadnja je bila na Mediteranskim
igrama u Splitu), osvojili treće mjesto na međunarodnom turniru u Poreču, peto
mjesto na Zlatarovom turniru u Zagrebu, doveli Hokej Kup Republike Hrvatske u
Split. 


Mediji
Mediji su nas
oduševljeno popratili te su novine i portali bili puni članaka o novopečenim
hokejašima, više puta u ovih godinu dana, nego je hokej u Republici Hrvatskoj
imao medijskog prostora ikad. 
Trenutni
projekti  i planovi našega kluba
Nedavno sam bio,
zajedno sa trenerom Lukom Androjom, na putovanju u Nizozmskoj, na razmjernu
iskustava  s hokej klubom u Oosterbeeku.
Također su ljudi iz Oosterbeeka i Engleske došli u Hrvatsku, u Split, podučiti
nas tehnikama i držanju hokeja treninga. 
Devet mladih momaka položilo je tečaj za hokej trenere, u Hrvatsku
su došli vodeći ljudi za hokej u Europi održati taj isti tečaj. Imamo podršku
jako velikog broja ljudi tako da se okupila i navijačka skupina koja ima svoju
himnu, zastavu i transparent. Želja nam je promovirati hokej u Dalmaciji tako
da se otvori još koji klub kako bismo mogli igrati s njima i kako bismo mogli
imati ligu. Također od jeseni planiramo pokrenuti grupu za djecu s Downovim
Sindromom i za žene. 
  
Problemi
s kojima se susrećemo
Problem nam je
nedostatak adekvatnog prostora za trening, bilo dvoranskog, bilo travnatog.
Nemamo protiv koga igrati ako ne putujemo, što nismo u financijskoj mogućnosti.
Nemamo ni naš Clubhouse ni travnjak ni specifičnu hokej opremu. Potreban nam je
novac kako bismo mogli iznajmiti prostor i pretvoriti ga u naš Clubhouse, naše
mjesto druženja i okupljanja, zatim kako bismo mogli postaviti travnjak, kupiti
speifičnu hokej opremu te putovati na natjecanja. 
Potreban
novac
Potrebno nam je  15000 $
Taj bismo novac potrošili
za:
· 
godišnji najam prostora:  3000 $ 
· 
instalacije struje:  1500 $
· 
instalacije vode: 1500 $
· 
obnova zidova, podova i stropova: 1500 $
· 
sanitarni čvorovi (4 wc-a s tuševima): 1500 $
· 
namještaj (stolovi i stolice za clubhouse kafić,
stolovi i stolice za dnevni prostror): 750 $
· 
sportski rekviziti:  750 $
· 
elektronička oprema (laptop, zvučnici, projektor):
750 $
· 
kupnju kombija: 3750 $ 

Drugi načini na koje nam možete
pomoći
Ukoliko
nam niste u mogućosti pomoći financijski, nema veze. Tu su drugi načini na koje
možete doprinijeti. Podijelite ovu kampanju sa svojim prijateljima i obitelji
kako bi što veći broj ljudi za nju čuo.

<p>Relid suits not only one jar, but a range

You can simply measure your jar with J-card to ensure witch size of Relid suits your jar. Then just<span style=""background-color: initial;""> put

Relid, a simple concept of reusing what you already have. It's a lid used on different shapes and sizes of jars, which is made from BPA free silicone with best quality. It's safe, easy, eco-friendly and useful. Put Relid on your jar, then you'll get a whole new container!

https://www.instagram.com/createwfu/ㄇㄞˋ點子               大人物The Story Exchange




We're changing the world every time we consume. If we can rethink about the possibility of reusing what we already have before purchasing, we can make the world a better place. We hope that through our design, we can both solve problems and create a new way of reusing used things.

Glass jars stand heat, acid, oil and are easy to clean, they seemed really useful. So you keep collecting them, until your cabinet is full of glass jars from jam and prickles. 


Full of glass jars without lids, what am I going to do with them?
And by the time you really need one, the lid is often rusted or lost. Glass jars without lids are like white elephants. 


Ewwww.....
But no worries! Relid is here to solve your ""jargantic"" problem!





Relid suits not only one jar, but a range
of them. No matter what size your jar is, Relid has it all covered. It comes with two sizes, large(for jars with Ø55~74 mm inner diameter) and small(for jars with Ø42~59 mm inner diameter). You can simply measure your jar with J-card to ensure witch size of Relid suits your jar. Then just put
Relid on, and you'll be ready to re-lid your jar.



No matter what size your jar is, Relid has it all covered.



Relid is made from FDA grade silicone, super safe for food. It's also oil and acid resistant, and stands a wide range of temperature, from -40°C to 200°C (-40°F~392°F), so you can put anything in the jar. It's easy to clean, and of course, it's dishwasher safe.


Yay! Relid is dishwasher safe!

Best of all, with its unique design, you can stack them up to safe space, no matter the size and amount of Relid you have.














You can use Relid anytime, anywhere you like and put anything in the jar you find, then seal it with Relid.
Not only you can store a lot of things — from dry foods like granola, oatmeal, cereal and pasta to liquids such as homemade apple sauce, flavored oil, tomato confit, pickled onions — but you can also jar up the food you made, such as salad, sushi, spaghetti... even pumpkin soup, and take them everywhere with the help of Relid.



You can have a fancy picnic in a beautiful park with your dearest friends,  have  nice, fresh, healthy, home-made lunches in office. Or you can escape from the busy urban life, by bringing one with you while hiking.





Who doesn't love picnic? With Relid, preparation is easy, the result is going to be stunningly beautiful and picnic with glass jars is really chic.




Tired of sandwiches for lunch? Prepare some fresh, healthy, home-made lunch with the help of our recipe.









In order to suit a variety of jars, Relid comes with two sizes, large(for jars with Ø55~74 mm inner diameter) and small(for jars with Ø42~59 mm inner diameter).

Two sizes to fit all your jars.


There're 3 colors: green, dark grey and red for both size.
Relid is made from FDA grade silicone with best quality. It's non-toxic, BPA free, oil and acid resistant, and stands a wide range of temperature, from -40°C to 200°C (-40°F~392°F). You can store anything without worrying.



FDA grade silicone with best quality.
Relid is made for most jars you can find, from Ø42~74 mm inner diameter. If you're not so sure how wide your jar is, you can download the J-card below to ensure Relid suits it. Simply download the J-card (.pdf), print it out and cut along the lines, then stick it into your jar to make sure which size of Relid suits it.



Click the pic above to download the J-card.








There're also postcards of jar up recipes available only on Indiegogo! Ten recipes from the Relid film, including chirashizushi, tomato confit, spicy asparagus, yogurt with blueberries and oatmeal bar, flavored oil, BBQ-on-sticks-to-go, salad, spaghetti, pumpkin soup and detox water. Or you can make your own food in the jar and share the photo or recipe with us!






The recipes that will appear on postcards.




PS. If the pledge includes random postcard, then you'll get a postcard with recipe on it which is going to be a surprise. You can share it with your friends and family, or invite them to join and become a Relider!





There is going to be some cost considerations and restrictions about mass production, Relid will make it only if we achieve the amount with your help. To thank you for helping Relid come true, there are stretch goals as below, new colors will unlock at 6K and 7K, making 6 colors of Relid for you to choose!

We are a team of adventure loving people with a passion for cool vehicles and the great outdoors. If you also love these things, then we guarantee you'll get excited about our campaign - so read on!

We want to bring a SHERP to the UK so it can be enjoyed by anyone.
Our team includes engineers; ex-military and outdoor education specialists; marketing experts; H&S approved and qualified staff for hospitality,
We already have access to storage and workshop facilities; a site with space for testing, hospitality and future expansion.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A probléma</h3>
<p>A Föld ivóvízkészletei végesek, fogynak, ez nem csak lokálisan probléma. Mindannyian tudunk tenni azért, hogy ne a felszín alatti vizeinket csapoljuk, hanem más forrásból nyerjünk vizet.</p>
<p>A Tolnai-dombság lankái között áll két Kicsiház, ahol a felhasznált vizet mi nem vezetékes vízrendszerből akarjuk kinyerni, hanem más megoldást választottunk. Ezzel két fontos küldetést is teljesítünk:</p>
<ol>
<li>csekély energiafelhasználással nyerünk vizet az esőből, így nem az értékes ivóvizet használjuk fürdésre, mosásra, wc öblítésre, vagy a növények locsolására;</li>
<li>hosszútávon egy olyan fenntartható rendszert építünk ki, amiből a hozzánk látogató vendégek anyagilag is részesülnek, mert így a két ház rezsiköltségét alacsonyabban tudjuk tartani, ezáltal a szállásdíj is kevesebb lesz.</li>
</ol>
<p>A Kicsiházakban olyan embereket látunk vendégül, akiknek nincs más helyük, alkalmuk arra, hogy megtervezzenek, megvalósítsanak valamit. Akiknek szükségük van az elvonulásra, az időre, a térre, a csendre ahhoz, hogy felkészüljenek a nagy kihívásra, egy új képregényük megrajzolására, vagy a könyvük megírására, stb.

</div></div>","A probléma
A Föld ivóvízkészletei végesek, fogynak, ez nem csak lokálisan probléma. Mindannyian tudunk tenni azért, hogy ne a felszín alatti vizeinket csapoljuk, hanem más forrásból nyerjünk vizet.
A Tolnai-dombság lankái között áll két Kicsiház, ahol a felhasznált vizet mi nem vezetékes vízrendszerből akarjuk kinyerni, hanem más megoldást választottunk. Ezzel két fontos küldetést is teljesítünk:

csekély energiafelhasználással nyerünk vizet az esőből, így nem az értékes ivóvizet használjuk fürdésre, mosásra, wc öblítésre, vagy a növények locsolására;
hosszútávon egy olyan fenntartható rendszert építünk ki, amiből a hozzánk látogató vendégek anyagilag is részesülnek, mert így a két ház rezsiköltségét alacsonyabban tudjuk tartani, ezáltal a szállásdíj is kevesebb lesz.

A Kicsiházakban olyan embereket látunk vendégül, akiknek nincs más helyük, alkalmuk arra, hogy megtervezzenek, megvalósítsanak valamit. Akiknek szükségük van az elvonulásra, az időre, a térre, a csendre ahhoz, hogy felkészüljenek a nagy kihívásra, egy új képregényük megrajzolására, vagy a könyvük megírására, stb. Vagy azok jönnek hozzánk, akik egyszerűen csak énidőre, elvonulásra, pihenésre vágynak.
Benke Éva vagyok, tervezek, alkotok, rajzolok - főleg mások álmait valósítom meg vizuálisan -, a vizuális művészetekről tanítok a jövő nemzedékének, anya és feleség vagyok.

Rusztikus részletek, tárgyak fogadnak majd.

A burkolatok, a felhasznált anyagok és felületek a természetességet tükröznek, és itt-ott egy kis retro elem is felbukkan.

A kertben is pihenhetsz, kikapcsolhatsz.

Our 20 years of experience in vegetarian tourism
across the Adriatic coast make the opening of a local restaurant in Zagreb our
logical next project. 




However, our success depends on your good will and

Why open a restaurant in the middle
of an economic crisis?


Come on!! There’s no better time to spread
optimism, passion and strength of conviction than an economic crisis, and this
is our way to help people live more affordable and healthy lives.





Friends from Slovenia, you are especially
invited to contribute because we are considering Ljubljana for our next stop in
this journey! (keep in mind that we are starting
off in Zagreb, so we must be gooood and prepared for this next step).

Our well established know-how...


What we already have is 20 years of know-how (vegetarian restaurant on the Adriatic coast), delivery vehicles, kitchen equipment, hardworking
people. In short, only one little thing is lacking, the money to cover some of the expenses, e.g. the rent.

We intend to raise the money to
     cover some of the 
expenses.
The money would cover prepaid lease
     for space (beautiful fantasy place in Zagreb), a little marketing, interior
     decoration... and we really need a new stove. Or two to be precise.

First:
fantasy place = What we have in mind is a surface of approx. 100 m2,
interior decoration = modern chairs, colourful tables, swing chairs, bar,
self-service line, terrace - enclosed for market/trade (organic groceries from our
trusted suppliers).


Delivery vehicles = our vehicles are equipped
with thermo boxes which keep the temperature and freshness of the food, ensuring high
quality delivery. We won’t make you wait for hours to get a reasonably-priced
meal delivered to your office. We will make it possible for you to track the progress
of the vehicle with your order on our website.

To be clear: we do not dream about money, we do not
dream about power,we dream
about high-quality foodand doing
what we really enjoy. We also intend to employ our friends, share the excitement,
have satisfied customers who can NOW finally choose healthy food at no extra
cost (vs. junk food) and have a family restaurant; a happy place for happy people.Please support us so we can do an excellent job
If you are not just around the corner (Zagreb, the capital of Croatia – the future capital with the best restaurant/catering in the world) you can:

help us get the word out and give a word of mouth about our campaign
buy our products, like lavender cushion or Sound Bath CD (first edition with a special thank you note from Vedran!)
or have a vacation on the Adriatic (island of Pašman) with our voucher card!

   What we would offer and why? FIRST - WHY?


During the last couple of years (or decades to be
precise), there’s been a noticeable upward trend in the popularity of vegetarian
food. This type of cuisine doesn’t put a strain on the body, yet provides sufficient
energy and vitality if properly balanced, i.e. if basic nutritional needs are
met. This kind of food also contributes to the preservation of our planet’s
basic resources, since the growing of foodstuffs used in vegetarian cuisine requires
10 times less resources then the production of food of animal origin.
All these reasons encourage modern people to partially
or completely change their dietary habits by excluding meat and other animal
products from their diet for a variety of reasons and to varying extents. People
resort to vegetarian food for medical, ethical or religious reasons and
purposes. 


AND SECOND - WE WILL OFFER:



healthy and favourably priced meals


easy to order, reliable and fast delivery
with our ""thermo"" vehicle


vegetarian (vegan) restaurant with all you
can eat*& drink** lunch offer
 *Self service meals, salads**Drink: tea & chickpea coffee, soya milk





Eggs and meat are not used in our dishes. We plan
meals with the optimum nutrition ratio in mind: 20% proteins, 40% carbohydrates, 40% low-energy
food. That goes for the catering part at least. 
But of course, in the restaurant every guest can choose
a meal to his/her liking, and after all, we mustn’t forget that this will be an all
you can eat & drink type of
restaurant.










Challenge... Yes it is.  

A smoke-free and alcohol-free restaurant.
Food without meat and sugar.



We are aware that this is not something a majority of
people would choose. Providing quality, imaginative, abundant and affordable restaurant
and catering services capable of attracting enough people to cover the costs is
always a challenge.
But we have:

Started designing for a company that was interested in remaking  from collected materials in a 7 story warehouse. I successfully developed 4 product lines for 2 seasons per year for 3 years. I opened a retail store, merchandised, Created ""Art"" pieces from recycled materials and launched ""Recycled Art Workshops"".  Trained sewers, introduced production techniques and standards. Opened wholesale accounts and positioned the company in ""green"" manufacturing.




   We need to raise $15,000 

                                           PLUS $2000 for supplies and materials               
 Each and every reward will be hand made by me...yes this is a Limited Collection. You will be a part of Greenbleez history!  THIS IS A FIXED FUNDED CAMPAIGN. If we don't raise the amount we'll be extremely saddened. Several years have been invested in R&D, establishing relationships with retailers and craft markets, state tested and approved, state certified for resale along with certification of ""green"" sustainable practices. We must protect design/intellectual property. Without the legal protection and brand positioning, we can not risk continuing.
    The Impact Your contributions will benefit children, planet, and people. You can feel good about giving a product that leaves a softer carbon footprint and expresses individuality. Supporting high-quality American made products. That are truly keepsakes and part of a Limited Collection.   We believe by contributing to reducing consumer waste we are ensuring a planet for our children and theirs. Sustainable manufacturing practices and movement towards a circular economy. Provide income with a sustainable wage for employees.
    Risks & Challenges We promise your Limited Edition Greenbleez product will be delivered by November 28, 2015, just in time for Holiday giving!
I'm sure some of you are thinking how in the world will she deliver a high-quality product all by herself?
Here's how:
 I have production experience and systems in place. Over 20 years working in small production. I have trained sewers and have production techniques from my Industry days.
 Greenbleez production has been going for 3 years by myself and I have never missed a deadline or NOT been stocked at a show.  I have been producing for this campaign for 3 months.

I know what I can produce without compromising quality. The production numbers are quite feasible. Production of inventory has been ongoing since Greenbleez's beginning. We're always sewing!
All my current stores know that it is necessary for me to protect the product and must be done now. They are willing to wait out a (HOLIDAY) season if it means the difference between no inventory for their Holiday season to ensure future success of Greenbleez  products.

<p>Welcome to our Indiegogo campaign! My name is Brandon Kemp, and the Nassau Night Market is my dream baby. Before moving back to The Bahamas, I traveled to nearly 40 countries, volunteering with a non-profit organization. One of the most striking countries I lived in was Taiwan, famous for their night markets. Parking lots, streets, and parks are transformed into one of their strongest expressions of culture and economic activity. My experience there inspired me to bring that concept home. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I returned to The Bahamas, I was shocked by 3 things: </p>
<ol>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Our downtown nearly completely shuts down after 5pm.</strong> In other capital cities, revenue in downtown areas dramatically increase after 6pm, but ours doesn't stay open long enough to experience that.</li>

</ol>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p>I knew that the perfect way to tackle these three ""shocks"" would be to bring the Taiwanese night market concept to downtown.

</p><p><b><u>About Heather:</u></b></p>
<p>Heather is a 28 year old ambitious
and aspiring entrepreneur living in the heart of Nashville.  She is planning to open a floatation therapy
center.  Flotation therapy is a very
unique business that will bring many benefits to the Nashville community.  </p>
<p>Heather spent the last six years
working in the corporate world for a large telecommunications company.  While working for this company, she relocated
multiple times, but is now lucky to be back with her family and loved ones in
Middle Tennessee.  While climbing the corporate ladder was never
on her personal agenda, she was very successful in her field.  Over the last six years, she worked in six locations
spanned across three states, and was the General Manager of three locations- consistently
leading a team of 20 plus direct reports. 
She credits her success to her personal drive, work ethic, dedication to
those around her, ability to build strong relationships, and surrounding
herself with strong mentors.  The
experience and knowledge that she accumulated while working in the corporate world
is something that can never be taken from her, and she believes it will be
invaluable in terms of her start up success. 
</p>
<p>In early 2015, Heather was
currently working around 60 hours per week in a high stress job, and she began
reading about the benefits that floating could have on stress and fatigue.  The benefits did not stop there.  The more research that she did, the more
intrigued she was.  The tank had so many
health benefits, and she was baffled that most of the general public had a limited
awareness of floatation therapy.  As
someone who spent the previous year in and out of the offices of neurologists,
seeking a possible diagnosis of Relapsing- Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, some of
the benefits sounded too good to be true. 
She decided to book a session at a local float club that was just
opening in her current city of Naperville, IL. The experience was like nothing she had ever
experienced before, and she was an immediate advocate of floating.  She immediately signed up for a membership
that gave her four floats per month, and she was able to share these with friends
and family.  Heather carried this membership
for the duration of her residency in IL, and also persuaded 10-20 people in her
life to try out the service.  Sometimes,
she would get push back at the beginning, but as a true saleswoman, she was
able to sell them on trying one of her free membership floats.  Every single person was blown away by their
experience, and many of those went on to open their own monthly memberships.  </p>

</ul>
<p><b><u>What are some benefits

<p>Heather encourages
everyone to go out and do their own research on the many benefits of floatation
therapy, but to save you some time; she has broken down for us what she
believes are the most predominant benefits studied and publicized.</p>

<li><p>Promotes relaxation, reduces fatigue, improves
insomnia, decreases stress and depression, provides mental clarity, increases
motivation, helps with phobias and addictions, and promotes energy. <b><i>1 hour in the float tank is equivalent to 4

<li><p>Stimulates creativity, awareness, learning, alertness,
and problem solving by promoting more left brain dominance</p></li>

<p><b><u>Final Thoughts:</u></b></p>
<p>This dream began close to a year ago, when Heather had her
first float experience.  That first
experience was in Naperville, IL, at Anicca Float Club.  The owners of the float center, Lindsay
Reinhardt and Paul Feyer, have been one of the largest sources of knowledge and
motivation for Heather to move forward with this dream.  They run their business with passion and
drive, and have given Heather an example of the type of business she wants to
own.  They have given her practical
advice throughout this process, while also being a voice of inspiration.  Heather says that these two individuals, who
are entrepreneurs turned into friends, inspired her to take risks and follow her
dreams all while making the world a better place.  Heather hopes that she will one day be able
to impact members of the Nashville community in this same way.  Below you will find a link to Heather’s personal
favorite float center, Anicca Float club, and also a video link of Lindsay
explaining the benefits of flotation therapy.

yearly basis to charities or organizations that are close to her heart.  To ensure this is secured, Heather is having
15% of all incoming revenue set aside into a trust account that will pay out
yearly to these charities.


John A Gupton College

Final Thoughts:
This dream began close to a year ago, when Heather had her
first float experience.  That first
experience was in Naperville, IL, at Anicca Float Club.  The owners of the float center, Lindsay
Reinhardt and Paul Feyer, have been one of the largest sources of knowledge and
motivation for Heather to move forward with this dream.  They run their business with passion and
drive, and have given Heather an example of the type of business she wants to
own.  They have given her practical
advice throughout this process, while also being a voice of inspiration.  Heather says that these two individuals, who
are entrepreneurs turned into friends, inspired her to take risks and follow her
dreams all while making the world a better place.  Heather hopes that she will one day be able
to impact members of the Nashville community in this same way.  Below you will find a link to Heather’s personal
favorite float center, Anicca Float club, and also a video link of Lindsay
explaining the benefits of flotation therapy.

low risk.   </p>
<p>We are ready for a new challenge.  This is a totally different business model than what we are used to--this model is mobile--but proven to work--just look at the Food Truck industry.  You can come to us at Caesar's Creek, ( and maybe Brookville Lake) or we can come to a lake or river near you.   Follow us on Facebook to see where we will be heading next and <b>book your flight</b> right from our page.   Even though it can be an extreme sport, nearly anyone can learn how to do it.  Please join with us to get people all over Ohio flying high.  Maybe you'll even find the super hero inside of you.</p>

Shred…there is no question
Some call us crazy, but trying a new
challenge and succeeding—even a little, and even if it’s not pretty, can be
very encouraging.  We have done many
things we never thought possible and want to help others realize what they are
capable of, as well.  You may not see
yourself as a “dare devil”, but Flyboarding could be a place to begin.  It’s easy to get started, is low impact and
low risk.   
We are ready for a new challenge.  This is a totally different business model than what we are used to--this model is mobile--but proven to work--just look at the Food Truck industry.  You can come to us at Caesar's Creek, ( and maybe Brookville Lake) or we can come to a lake or river near you.   Follow us on Facebook to see where we will be heading next and book your flight right from our page.   Even though it can be an extreme sport, nearly anyone can learn how to do it.  Please join with us to get people all over Ohio flying high.  Maybe you'll even find the super hero inside of you.



Other Ways You Can Help
The $7500 will
basically get things rolling.  We will still need to find plenty of riders
this season to cover all the expenses. So, please share
this campaign and our FB page with others on social media. Thank you",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> Everyone calls me ""Snook"". For the past dozen years I have been running an industrial creative space called NIMBY.

<p>In the past we have always relied on the generosity of performers and musicians to put on a show and raise money for the space and other projects. This time lets let the gear heads and good hearted raise some fun. I want to fix up this old truck and deliver Christmas trees and pumpkins to those that can't get out to get their own. It's a crazy thought I have had for years and it needs to happen at least once. Maybe a hay ride in a local parade.

You loose nothing and I will sell this truck ""as is"" this summer to someone that will restore it. The proceeds will go back to NIMBY for storing the truck all these years. If we actually make the goal we will make deals with local pumpkin patches and tree lots to deliver trees. I have purposely aimed low on this ask to make it happen.

<p><b>The Idea</b></p>
<p>I am developing a new method of synthesizing diamonds. Imagine taking a powder and turning it into a diamond in a few hours, with total costs of only ten dollars per carat. Any size, any shape.</p>
<p><b>The Idea</b></p>
<p>A few years ago I was doing theoretical work with adamantane (the smallest molecule with the same chemical structure as diamond).

<p>Diadamantane is commercially available as a powder thus it can be poured into a mold before conversion to diamond. With the material components aligned, the energy required for the creation of diamonds should be much lower than current methods. Exactly how much lower is one of the things this experiment is going to determine.</p>
<p><b>The Plan</b><br/></p>
<p>Build a specialized oven (crucible), make diamonds. Sounds simple right? The oven itself should be fairly simple but the experimental process, that is another matter entirely. With eleven different variables to test at high, middle, and low values there is a lot of testing to do. Twenty three initial settings. Evaluate the results and try differing combinations until the limits of the 1st iteration crucible are reached. Study the results and use that data to build the second iteration crucible. Repeat. Each trial will be run three times and will consist of five samples of approximately three carats each. Once conversion is achieved samples will be sent out to the AGS laboratories for quality assessment and certification. My funding goal will provide enough money to build three iterations of the crucible, with a little extra to cover unexpected costs.

Diamonds
Diamonds are the hardest substance known to humankind, they can be used in optics, electronics, cutting tools, jewelry, and more things that haven't even been created yet. The synthetic diamond industry nets roughly 1.5 billion dollars per year. Most are used for 'industrial' purposes although synthetic jewelry is becoming more common.
I have been planning this for a few years now. I have identified the components required for conversion. I have identified the variables, and designed an experiment to test them singly and together. Inexpensive man-made diamonds can be a reality. I have done the theoretical work, but that is as far as I can go on my own. I need your help to bring this the rest of the way.

Risks & Challenges This is an experiment. It should work, but I may be wrong. The testing plan is designed to maximize the chance of success.
I am an unknown individual. I cannot provide character references. My name is not attached to any scientific research. I do not have a college degree. I was a chemical engineering student and I do know my chemistry. I am willing to work hard. I will see this through to the end.
Should the experiments fail to produce diamonds, any funding levels beyond my capabilities will be rewarded with carat equivalents of the highest level achieved.

You may feel that the risks are just too high to contribute your money, I am okay with that. However, if you think this is cool, neat, or even awesome... please, tell people about it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I’m Mario,
an Environmental Engineer and a Beekeeper. 
For the last 20 years, I’ve been battling: pollution, global warming, deforestation and extinction.  So if you think your job stinks, think of me working on top of a Wastewater treatment plant holding the raw sewer of a whole city!</p>
<p>Today, Bees are endangered, so we decided to tackle this problem head on… to do this we developed The Hive Genie.</p>

<p><b>OUR STORY; A BEEKEEPERS GAUNTLET</b></p>
<p>My family and I love honey, but we couldn’t find the good quality, pure, raw, organic honey that would make us happy. Being a family of doers, we decided to do it ourselves and went into beekeeping putting our best foot forward by acquiring three hives. </p>
<p>Our hard work and tender loving care were not enough and we ended up loosing all of them.  It was a hard, and very sad way to learn that the more information you gather from your hive, the better equipped you are to succeed as a beekeeper.  </p>
<p>But properly monitoring the hives is easier said than done;
it’s time consuming work with the bonus of a few stings.  And learning about bees takes a long time.</p>
<p>Open the hives too frequently and you disturb the bees too much;
leave them by themselves too long and they may swarm on you, costing most of
your honey and half of your bees.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443715837/tvzthyvaauhceen7fbjd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Or like it happened to us, you come to see them a day too late and figure out that you
could have saved them from drowning or moths had you checked them earlier.   </p>
<p><b>SOLUTION</b></p>
<p>Today, we enjoy our bees and our quasi organic honey (hard to say organic 100%, you never know where the bees forage from, but we do our part!).  And we want to make the beekeeping experience
simple and enjoyable for everybody so more people can have bees.  Also, we want to save the bees but we need
tons of information to find the causes of Colony Collapse Disorder.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443715783/scy56qjxvgxoydaw6ijo.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 467.345px; height: 619px;""/></p>
<br/><p>After three years of design work and testing, we have
developed the Hive Genie. </p>

<p><b>BENEFITS</b></p>
<p>When a problem is detected the HIVE GENIE suggests an
inspection and in some cases a solution.  The on board LED will let you
know when something is wrong and what to do. </p>
<p>In the cloud application you can have a graphic
display of your different hives, add notes and compare them to other hives from
around the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443716632/k0rlmhtrncjlvkxzaixq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Monitor the effect of specific pesticides and monoculture
crops in real time.</p>
<p>Know when to add another supper or when to harvest your
honey.  </p>
<p>Have a graphic view of the honey flow in each of your
hives.  Know when to start and stop
feeding or if it is necessary at all.</p>
<p>See how your bees are handling the cold winters and hot
summers, and get alerted if they need assistance.  Detect when your hive is sick or under attack,
especially at night.</p>
<p>Make sure your queen is laying and get population estimates.</p>
<p>Know
when you can split your hive and get alerted when they are about to swarm.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b></p>
<p>The gates sizes have been tailored to protect the bees from
hornets, mice and moths while letting the bees enter and exit freely, even
during the peak of the honey flow.  </p>

<p><b>TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
<p>The Hive Genie is Arduino based, which means it is proven
and reliable open source technology.  It
also means that can be hacked with and expanded with many people’s inventions.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>OPTIONAL ADD ONs, STRETCH GOALS</b></p>
<p>The Hive Genie has connectors for future optional actuators that can be
installed in the hive such as: cameras, microphones, heaters, fans, infrared
motion detectors, automated skylights, beetle traps and powder sugar sprinklers.  </p>
<p>Since we've talked to a lot of beekeepers from around the world, we have a pretty good feeling for what add-ons and plug ins we should do.  So as we pass our campaign goal, we will start to develop some of these add-ons. </p>

<p><b>ADVANTAGES</b></p>
<p>Researchers and Commercial beekeepers may monitor hundreds
of hives in a matter of seconds.   As few as 5 to 10% of your hives monitored
with the Hive Genie can give a solid statistical sampling of your entire apiary.</p>

<p><b>8. Hi Mario,</b></p>
<p><b>Quick question for you, please.</b></p>
<p><b>First, by way of background: </b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I started keeping bees in 1968.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>Bees are a big part of my life…I have my hands on active beehives 5
or more days a week and I am always researching, or otherwise involved with
bees, such as public speaking on bee topics.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I believe tech innovations are (and will be) very important to the
future of beekeeping.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I invest heavily in tech innovations related to bee health and
beekeeping.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I participate in online/crowdfunding of beekeeping innovations.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I have viewed your indiegogo video.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I sincerely wish you the best with this and other beekeeping
innovations.</b></p>
<p><b><span>  </span>I hope my comments here will not be a cause of discouragement.</b></p>
<p><b>Because you reached out to me via email prior to your indiegogo
campaign and again with this promo update, I am inquiring specifically of you.</b></p>
<p><b>My concern (and then my question)</b></p>
<p><b>A.<span> 
</span>In my experience, bees need a lot of unrestricted access to their
hive. By the way, for at least 8 months of the year, my hives all have top
entrances as well as bottom entrances. In fact, I would say that most of my
bees only ever enter at the top, rather than via the bottom board. 
Bees—in my experience--just prefer it that way, whether beekeepers ever know it
or not.  In any event, in most of the beekeeping I have ever been involved
with, the bees (during most of the year) need a lot of ingress and egress, AND
the ability to ventilate the cavity.  </b></p>
<p><b>B.<span> 
</span>My concern, with respect to your system: if bees are constricted in
their ingress and egress to a few slots on a bottom board, how would they be
able to cure/desiccate their honey, control humidity levels in the brood area,
ensure adequate oxygen supply and how would the traffic congestion impact the
hive.  Sorry to say: I am confident that if I were to constrict any of my
colonies to the limited apertures provided in your device, they would either
perish from overheating or they would swarm because their hive box would be
unmanageable due to overheat, excessive humidity and lack of oxygen. 
Alternatively, I question whether any hive small enough that it could survive
with such a constricted entrance/exit would be worth owning, from an economic
perspective.</b></p>
<p><b>So my sincere question is:  Setting aside a “reduced entrance”
management practice for wintertime in cold climates, how could any beekeeper
have a viable hive with such a small entrance?  In other words: Where is
there a beekeeper who could actually use the system proposed in your Indiegogo
campaign?</b></p>
<p><b>Thanks in advance for considering my question…I sincerely do not
mean to be disrespectful.</b></p>
<p><b>With kind regards,</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you a lot for your feedback I do appreciate it a lot.
 To be perfectly honest, that was one of my concerns too ( in fact a major
one ) and we have <span>a few
solutions for this, so please continue reading.  </span></p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>I
have talked to many researchers like Dr. Rangel from UT and Dr. Lilia De Guzman
from the USDA ARS and none of them have this concern.  </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Even
so, I still have the same concern as you.  I have personally tested the
Hive Genie in my hives with no adverse consequences, although I do confess the
tests were from August to October.  So no real heat issues.  I’m
still concerned about this so what I’m doing now is that we are testing new
sensors that do not require entrance restriction.  But keep reading… 
</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Also,
we have already developed an entrance block that permits ventilation. 
Look at our store at <a href=""http://www.hivegenie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hivegenie.com</a></p>
<p>4.<span>  </span>According
to Thomas D. Seeley in his book Honey Bee democracy bees actually prefer
smaller entrances and only one is needed. They do prefer it at the bottom.</p>
<p>5.<span>  </span>The
Practical beekeeper author also point this, although he mentions he prefers top
entrances… but Thomas D Seeley is the world’s leading bee authority.  </p>
<p>6.<span>  </span>Either
way, the Hive Genie could be retrofitted to use top entrances.</p>
<p>7.<span>  </span>Remember
that temp and RH will be measured constantly and if that would cause a problem
you would be alerted…</p>
<p>8.<span>  </span>Now,
what I do know for a fact is that moist air is heavier than dry air, so the air
will actually exit through the screen bottom board of the hive, while new air
enters from the top (yes, we may or should develop some sort of vent…)</p>
<p>9.<span>  </span>Also,
reduced entrances are easier to defend from robbers, intruders and make it
somewhat more difficult for hive beetles to enter.</p>
<p>10.<span>  </span>Most
wild colonies or those found in houses have very tiny entrances.</p>
<p>11.<span>  </span>A
reduced entrance is better for bees because temperature will not change as
fast, which is better for brood.</p>
<p>12.<span>  </span>Bees
tolerate a lot of heat, in fact their preferred temp of 34 Celsius is a hot
temperature, so in general cold is the enemy, not heat.</p>
<p>13.<span>  </span>Hot
air evaporates more water, so temperature regulation gets easier for bees as
air approaches their goal temp.</p>
<p>14.<span>  </span>Warre
hives, Japanese traditional hives and many other have bottom only entrances. </p>
<p>15.<span>  </span>I’ve
always had bottom only entrances with no problems… but I do use screen bottom
boards…</p>
<p>So yes, I do have screen bottom boards, I do have the same
concern as you but there are many solutions to this problem.  My pledge to
you is that if regardless of this project becoming funded, we will continue
testing to get this concern off our minds.  I include myself again with
you.  I personally tried to include (and perhaps will) more entrances but
at the time we were concerned about pricing, but perhaps we should add more
entrances.  I do agree</p>
<p>So I guess what I’m trying to say is that part of the experience
of crowdfunding is getting valuable feedback such as yours.  Honestly, you
are the first beekeeper other than me, that expresses this concern (others may
have it but not express it)  I will think of a way to include a solution
before the campaign is over.</p>
<p>And as I state in my campaign timeline and budget, there is
still going to be another engineering round before the final product is
launched.  And I assure you we will solve this potential problem…</p>
<p>Thanks again for your interest in Hive Genie</p>

<p><strong>1. So How Powerful does the Hive Genie really is?  There are a lot of claims of what it can do.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FxblMuHumEKQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxblMuHumEKQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FxblMuHumEKQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><strong><br/></strong><p></p>
<p>To put things in perspective lets compare Hive Genie with some famous computers:</p>
<p>The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) which was the computer in the command module of NASA's Apollo missions and helped astronauts to control the module's navigation path to the Moon and back, had 64 Kbytes of memory and operated at a speed of 0.043 MHz.</p>
<p>The Hive Genie has 32 Kbytes of Program memory but operates at 16 MHz.  So this means that the Hive Genie runs 372 times faster than the Apollo Guidance Computer, but has only half the memory for programming.  That's OK though, we are not flying to the moon, we are only relaying information to the cloud and controlling a few add ons!  Plenty of power.  The rest of the program is on the cloud where we can interpret all the data gathered and trigger alarms.  In some ironic twist, our ""Mission Control"" is on the cloud!  Fascinating times we live in!  </p>

Is it wireless.<br/>
Does it require a phone chip?</b><b><br/>
How do you access the cloud, does it do Android/ Apple or OS only?</b></p>
<p><b>More information would be useful</b></p>
<p>It has WiFi.  if you
don't have WiFi signal in your hive, you can buy a router in Amazon for $30 USD
that can solve this problem and use the cell phone network to connect to the
cloud.</p>
<p>It is an Arduino based microcontroller.  We have engineered in such a way as to leave
3 to 6 pins for output, that is control things...  I will now answer your questions in order:</p>
<p>1, About counting bees. 
Let's assume that you have 30,000 foragers in your hive (which is
typical average), so in the morning, 30,000 bees will go out, the counter
counts how many bees go out, as they complete their rounds, some will come back
and exit again.  So the number of bees
out will be changing over time, but at the end of the day only three things can
happen:  The number of bees that came
back is less than the ones that left. 
This is the normal thing, you expect to loose around 1000 bees at the
honey flow per day.  Your Queen can lay
more than 1900 eggs a day so you are fine. 
If you loose say 5000 a day, you can safely assume that some pesticide
is killing your bees.  Your Queen won't
be able to keep up you may loose your hive in as little as 5 to 10 days!  And perhaps call it CCD!</p>
<p>The other thing that can happen but would be rare, is that
the exact number of bees that exited came back in.</p>
<p>The third thing would be you get 20,000 bees more into your
hive, therefore africanization.  Now, if
the activity doubles and the weight decreases, then you are being robbed.  If all the bees are going out and no bee is
coming in, then your bees are about to swarm. 
 You have may be a couple of hours
to catch them.  Hive Genie will let you
know within minutes of any of these things happening!</p>
<p>2. Weight is measured by a probe under the front end of the
hive and we just double the weight.  It
is a rough estimate but the trend is what you need.  Over time with your personal feedback you can
figure out a correction factor.</p>
<p>3. Yes temp probe inside and out and the same probe can
measure relative Humidity.</p>
<p>4. Ambient light detector is important so if you have a lot
of nocturnal activity, then moths may be coming in or your bees are under
attack by a skunk or something like it.</p>
<p>5. OK, to determine if the Queen is laying we keep the
count.  Let's say 30,000 bees exited
yesterday and 29,000 came back.  If today
another 30,000 exit, then you can assume that the Queen is laying at least
enough to replace the death toll.  On the
contrary if 29,000 go out today, and tomorrow 28,000 and so on, you may have no
Queen.  Also, when the Queen is laying,
the temperature is pretty stable at around 33-34 ºC and if there is no Queen,
temp inside the hive will vary throughout the day. </p>
<p>So counting bees bidirectionally actually tells a very good
story of what is going on inside and outside of your hive!</p>
<p>About the camera: 
SORRY it does not for two reasons:</p>
<p>A. The image signal takes a lot of space in the controller
so we wouldn't be able to count or weigh bees, which in my mind are the two
most important pieces of information.  A
camera only tells you what is going on in the parts you can see, as weight and
count tell you the whole story, even about foraging dangers.  Also, the camera can only tell what you
personally see, as where with numbers you the software can trigger alarms 24/7</p>
<p>B. A camera and servos to move it would cost as much as a
GoPro, in which case you just go and buy a GoPro or a surveillance system.</p>
<p>I am not saying that a camera is not a good idea, but for
now it is not a priority.  Maybe if lots
of beeks ask we can develop something in the near future.</p>
<p>6. I think this is explained above.  The fact that all the alarms are on the cloud
means that as we gather more info we can fine tune and correlate more things...</p>
<p>7. Currently it does not have a nose; maybe in the future we
can find a sensor that detects this! 
Exciting isn't it?</p>
<p>Actually with our prototypes we can measure:</p>
<p>Bees bidirectionally</p>
<p>Temp and humidity</p>
<p>Weight</p>
<p>Light intensity</p>
<p>So we tested all this and we are refining the alarm system
triggers as we learn more.  Since our
alarm system will be on the cloud, we can constantly fine tune it and develop
new alarms when enough data reveals more correlations to other events.</p>
<p>Hope this info is useful, will be glad to answer more
questions...</p>
<br/>
</div>

</div></div>","MONITOR: 14 to 16 sensors will monitor every aspect of your hive's health, population and stores.  The cloud app will send you an alarm when something needs your attention.  See what's going on in other hives from around the world so you can prepare in advance...


CONTROLLER: Capacity to control up to 6 different plug-ins (fans, heaters, valves, servos, etc...)  Is like having another you taking care of your bees 24/7.


GUARDIAN: Designed to keep predators like hornets, moths and mice out and let bees enter and exit freely. Designed for Langstroth hive can easily be adapted to fit almost any hive system.



Short Summary 

Hi, I’m Mario,
an Environmental Engineer and a Beekeeper. 
For the last 20 years, I’ve been battling: pollution, global warming, deforestation and extinction.  So if you think your job stinks, think of me working on top of a Wastewater treatment plant holding the raw sewer of a whole city!
Today, Bees are endangered, so we decided to tackle this problem head on… to do this we developed The Hive Genie.



The Hive Genie is a Robotic beekeeper, Pest Management System,  a Guardian and an Information Center all in one
Bee friendly unit.  Our patent pending technology can actually tell
apart between incoming and outgoing bees. Temperature, humidity, foraging
activity, weight and light are all measured constantly. 
Information is sent to the cloud were you can have a graphic view of your hives.  If something is wrong in the hive, you can get customizable alerts on your mobile.  By detecting problems in their early stages the chances of succeeding are way higher.

The Hive Genie will save you: time, work, money and could save your bees!
  By opting to share your hive's info, valuable data can be gathered to pinpoint the causes of Colony Collapse Disorder and save the bees.







Even so, in the last decade, the world has lost about 40% of
its bee population.  Which
is twice above the normal loses.  



OUR STORY; A BEEKEEPERS GAUNTLET
My family and I love honey, but we couldn’t find the good quality, pure, raw, organic honey that would make us happy. Being a family of doers, we decided to do it ourselves and went into beekeeping putting our best foot forward by acquiring three hives. 
Our hard work and tender loving care were not enough and we ended up loosing all of them.  It was a hard, and very sad way to learn that the more information you gather from your hive, the better equipped you are to succeed as a beekeeper.  
But properly monitoring the hives is easier said than done;
it’s time consuming work with the bonus of a few stings.  And learning about bees takes a long time.
Open the hives too frequently and you disturb the bees too much;
leave them by themselves too long and they may swarm on you, costing most of
your honey and half of your bees.



Or like it happened to us, you come to see them a day too late and figure out that you
could have saved them from drowning or moths had you checked them earlier.   
SOLUTION
Today, we enjoy our bees and our quasi organic honey (hard to say organic 100%, you never know where the bees forage from, but we do our part!).  And we want to make the beekeeping experience
simple and enjoyable for everybody so more people can have bees.  Also, we want to save the bees but we need
tons of information to find the causes of Colony Collapse Disorder.


After three years of design work and testing, we have
developed the Hive Genie. 




BENEFITS
When a problem is detected the HIVE GENIE suggests an
inspection and in some cases a solution.  The on board LED will let you
know when something is wrong and what to do. 
In the cloud application you can have a graphic
display of your different hives, add notes and compare them to other hives from
around the world.



Monitor the effect of specific pesticides and monoculture
crops in real time.
Know when to add another supper or when to harvest your
honey.  
Have a graphic view of the honey flow in each of your
hives.  Know when to start and stop
feeding or if it is necessary at all.
See how your bees are handling the cold winters and hot
summers, and get alerted if they need assistance.  Detect when your hive is sick or under attack,
especially at night.
Make sure your queen is laying and get population estimates.
Know
when you can split your hive and get alerted when they are about to swarm.




FEATURES
The gates sizes have been tailored to protect the bees from
hornets, mice and moths while letting the bees enter and exit freely, even
during the peak of the honey flow.  

TECHNOLOGY
The Hive Genie is Arduino based, which means it is proven
and reliable open source technology.  It
also means that can be hacked with and expanded with many people’s inventions.

OPTIONAL ADD ONs, STRETCH GOALS
The Hive Genie has connectors for future optional actuators that can be
installed in the hive such as: cameras, microphones, heaters, fans, infrared
motion detectors, automated skylights, beetle traps and powder sugar sprinklers.  
Since we've talked to a lot of beekeepers from around the world, we have a pretty good feeling for what add-ons and plug ins we should do.  So as we pass our campaign goal, we will start to develop some of these add-ons. 



You can
connect and control your Flow Hive from the HIVE GENIE! (Stretch Goal check our store at www.HiveGenie.com for other possible future add-ons).  These is a concept for the Flow Hive valve.  Still very rough though!



INSTALLATION
The HIVE GENIE is easy to install: simply slide the unit in
your hive entrance, introduce the temperature and humidity probe and position
the weight sensors underneath it and you are done! 

ADVANTAGES
Researchers and Commercial beekeepers may monitor hundreds
of hives in a matter of seconds.   As few as 5 to 10% of your hives monitored
with the Hive Genie can give a solid statistical sampling of your entire apiary.


Backyard beekeepers can enjoy the hive all day long and know
what’s happening even if you are a beginner.
Take care of your bees while on vacation!
The Hive Genie makes beekeeping easier on beginners and
experts alike.  And it’s easier on the
bees too. 
Get
your HIVE GENIE and enjoy your bees. Now, you will only have to open the hive
for the right reasons.
It’s like
BIG BROTHER for your hive!
Hive Genie is like the R2 unit of the hive.


COMMUNITY

Environmental problems are solvable.  In the past, humanity has saved the whales
from extinction, stopped the ozone layer depletion, and re-mediated polluted
areas. Every
day more people have access to vaccines and potable water.   Now,
let’s save the bees! 
By installing Hive Genies across the globe and sharing the
information gathered we know we can save the bees! Help
us save the bees, starting with your own! 
The information we can collect with your Hive Genies is invaluable to
researchers.  Our little friends deserve our help. 
The Hive Genie will save you: time, work, money and could save your bees!
So spread the word and join us.
To make the HIVE GENIE readily available at super cool
prices, we need your support so we can make production runs that are cost
effective.  Make a pledge or
donation  and help us make the HIVE GENIE
a reality.  
Make
sure to select the HIVE GENIE that is right for you.  




NOTE:  As you can see we decided to remove the LCD so we could add some more sensing capabilities.  All visual info will be available on the cloud and via a color code in the Hive Genie's only LED.  This thing looks more and more like R2!  But in doesn't whistle.




You can count on HIVE GENIE to count your bees!  BEE HAPPY!

FAQ
What is the difference between the different Hive Genie Models?

Look at the table with the models above...

8. Hi Mario,
Quick question for you, please.
First, by way of background: 
  I started keeping bees in 1968.
  Bees are a big part of my life…I have my hands on active beehives 5
or more days a week and I am always researching, or otherwise involved with
bees, such as public speaking on bee topics.
  I believe tech innovations are (and will be) very important to the
future of beekeeping.
  I invest heavily in tech innovations related to bee health and
beekeeping.
  I participate in online/crowdfunding of beekeeping innovations.
  I have viewed your indiegogo video.
  I sincerely wish you the best with this and other beekeeping
innovations.
  I hope my comments here will not be a cause of discouragement.
Because you reached out to me via email prior to your indiegogo
campaign and again with this promo update, I am inquiring specifically of you.
My concern (and then my question)
A. 
In my experience, bees need a lot of unrestricted access to their
hive. By the way, for at least 8 months of the year, my hives all have top
entrances as well as bottom entrances. In fact, I would say that most of my
bees only ever enter at the top, rather than via the bottom board. 
Bees—in my experience--just prefer it that way, whether beekeepers ever know it
or not.  In any event, in most of the beekeeping I have ever been involved
with, the bees (during most of the year) need a lot of ingress and egress, AND
the ability to ventilate the cavity.  
B. 
My concern, with respect to your system: if bees are constricted in
their ingress and egress to a few slots on a bottom board, how would they be
able to cure/desiccate their honey, control humidity levels in the brood area,
ensure adequate oxygen supply and how would the traffic congestion impact the
hive.  Sorry to say: I am confident that if I were to constrict any of my
colonies to the limited apertures provided in your device, they would either
perish from overheating or they would swarm because their hive box would be
unmanageable due to overheat, excessive humidity and lack of oxygen. 
Alternatively, I question whether any hive small enough that it could survive
with such a constricted entrance/exit would be worth owning, from an economic
perspective.
So my sincere question is:  Setting aside a “reduced entrance”
management practice for wintertime in cold climates, how could any beekeeper
have a viable hive with such a small entrance?  In other words: Where is
there a beekeeper who could actually use the system proposed in your Indiegogo
campaign?
Thanks in advance for considering my question…I sincerely do not
mean to be disrespectful.
With kind regards,

Thank you a lot for your feedback I do appreciate it a lot.
 To be perfectly honest, that was one of my concerns too ( in fact a major
one ) and we have a few
solutions for this, so please continue reading.  
1.  I
have talked to many researchers like Dr. Rangel from UT and Dr. Lilia De Guzman
from the USDA ARS and none of them have this concern.  
2.  Even
so, I still have the same concern as you.  I have personally tested the
Hive Genie in my hives with no adverse consequences, although I do confess the
tests were from August to October.  So no real heat issues.  I’m
still concerned about this so what I’m doing now is that we are testing new
sensors that do not require entrance restriction.  But keep reading… 

3.  Also,
we have already developed an entrance block that permits ventilation. 
Look at our store at www.hivegenie.com
4.  According
to Thomas D. Seeley in his book Honey Bee democracy bees actually prefer
smaller entrances and only one is needed. They do prefer it at the bottom.
5.  The
Practical beekeeper author also point this, although he mentions he prefers top
entrances… but Thomas D Seeley is the world’s leading bee authority.  
6.  Either
way, the Hive Genie could be retrofitted to use top entrances.
7.  Remember
that temp and RH will be measured constantly and if that would cause a problem
you would be alerted…
8.  Now,
what I do know for a fact is that moist air is heavier than dry air, so the air
will actually exit through the screen bottom board of the hive, while new air
enters from the top (yes, we may or should develop some sort of vent…)
9.  Also,
reduced entrances are easier to defend from robbers, intruders and make it
somewhat more difficult for hive beetles to enter.
10.  Most
wild colonies or those found in houses have very tiny entrances.
11.  A
reduced entrance is better for bees because temperature will not change as
fast, which is better for brood.
12.  Bees
tolerate a lot of heat, in fact their preferred temp of 34 Celsius is a hot
temperature, so in general cold is the enemy, not heat.
13.  Hot
air evaporates more water, so temperature regulation gets easier for bees as
air approaches their goal temp.
14.  Warre
hives, Japanese traditional hives and many other have bottom only entrances. 
15.  I’ve
always had bottom only entrances with no problems… but I do use screen bottom
boards…
So yes, I do have screen bottom boards, I do have the same
concern as you but there are many solutions to this problem.  My pledge to
you is that if regardless of this project becoming funded, we will continue
testing to get this concern off our minds.  I include myself again with
you.  I personally tried to include (and perhaps will) more entrances but
at the time we were concerned about pricing, but perhaps we should add more
entrances.  I do agree
So I guess what I’m trying to say is that part of the experience
of crowdfunding is getting valuable feedback such as yours.  Honestly, you
are the first beekeeper other than me, that expresses this concern (others may
have it but not express it)  I will think of a way to include a solution
before the campaign is over.
And as I state in my campaign timeline and budget, there is
still going to be another engineering round before the final product is
launched.  And I assure you we will solve this potential problem…
Thanks again for your interest in Hive Genie



1. So How Powerful does the Hive Genie really is?  There are a lot of claims of what it can do.

To put things in perspective lets compare Hive Genie with some famous computers:
The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) which was the computer in the command module of NASA's Apollo missions and helped astronauts to control the module's navigation path to the Moon and back, had 64 Kbytes of memory and operated at a speed of 0.043 MHz.
The Hive Genie has 32 Kbytes of Program memory but operates at 16 MHz.  So this means that the Hive Genie runs 372 times faster than the Apollo Guidance Computer, but has only half the memory for programming.  That's OK though, we are not flying to the moon, we are only relaying information to the cloud and controlling a few add ons!  Plenty of power.  The rest of the program is on the cloud where we can interpret all the data gathered and trigger alarms.  In some ironic twist, our ""Mission Control"" is on the cloud!  Fascinating times we live in!

2. Mario I've just read your web page - Quite a
lot of claims but I figure presently you only monitor-
1.  Bees
going in and out - numbers. How does it know internal hive numbers?
2.  Hive
weight with a probe under the Box on one edge?
3.  Ambient
Temp inside and out side the hive - temperature probe
4.  Ambient
Light - light sensor
5.  How
does it tell you what the Queen is laying? Does it come equipped with a camera?
6.  How
does it know about infestations? Is there a way or means of detecting foreign
invaders?
7.  Does
it detect and understand the hive pheromones?
What specifically does it presently actually
measure?
I understand you have used open source and that others can then use your code
to ""Add On"" functions, apps etc and the possibilities are
""endless""
Is it wireless.
Does it require a phone chip?
How do you access the cloud, does it do Android/ Apple or OS only?
More information would be useful
It has WiFi.  if you
don't have WiFi signal in your hive, you can buy a router in Amazon for $30 USD
that can solve this problem and use the cell phone network to connect to the
cloud.
It is an Arduino based microcontroller.  We have engineered in such a way as to leave
3 to 6 pins for output, that is control things...  I will now answer your questions in order:
1, About counting bees. 
Let's assume that you have 30,000 foragers in your hive (which is
typical average), so in the morning, 30,000 bees will go out, the counter
counts how many bees go out, as they complete their rounds, some will come back
and exit again.  So the number of bees
out will be changing over time, but at the end of the day only three things can
happen:  The number of bees that came
back is less than the ones that left. 
This is the normal thing, you expect to loose around 1000 bees at the
honey flow per day.  Your Queen can lay
more than 1900 eggs a day so you are fine. 
If you loose say 5000 a day, you can safely assume that some pesticide
is killing your bees.  Your Queen won't
be able to keep up you may loose your hive in as little as 5 to 10 days!  And perhaps call it CCD!
The other thing that can happen but would be rare, is that
the exact number of bees that exited came back in.
The third thing would be you get 20,000 bees more into your
hive, therefore africanization.  Now, if
the activity doubles and the weight decreases, then you are being robbed.  If all the bees are going out and no bee is
coming in, then your bees are about to swarm. 
 You have may be a couple of hours
to catch them.  Hive Genie will let you
know within minutes of any of these things happening!
2. Weight is measured by a probe under the front end of the
hive and we just double the weight.  It
is a rough estimate but the trend is what you need.  Over time with your personal feedback you can
figure out a correction factor.
3. Yes temp probe inside and out and the same probe can
measure relative Humidity.
4. Ambient light detector is important so if you have a lot
of nocturnal activity, then moths may be coming in or your bees are under
attack by a skunk or something like it.
5. OK, to determine if the Queen is laying we keep the
count.  Let's say 30,000 bees exited
yesterday and 29,000 came back.  If today
another 30,000 exit, then you can assume that the Queen is laying at least
enough to replace the death toll.  On the
contrary if 29,000 go out today, and tomorrow 28,000 and so on, you may have no
Queen.  Also, when the Queen is laying,
the temperature is pretty stable at around 33-34 ºC and if there is no Queen,
temp inside the hive will vary throughout the day. 
So counting bees bidirectionally actually tells a very good
story of what is going on inside and outside of your hive!
About the camera: 
SORRY it does not for two reasons:
A. The image signal takes a lot of space in the controller
so we wouldn't be able to count or weigh bees, which in my mind are the two
most important pieces of information.  A
camera only tells you what is going on in the parts you can see, as weight and
count tell you the whole story, even about foraging dangers.  Also, the camera can only tell what you
personally see, as where with numbers you the software can trigger alarms 24/7
B. A camera and servos to move it would cost as much as a
GoPro, in which case you just go and buy a GoPro or a surveillance system.
I am not saying that a camera is not a good idea, but for
now it is not a priority.  Maybe if lots
of beeks ask we can develop something in the near future.
6. I think this is explained above.  The fact that all the alarms are on the cloud
means that as we gather more info we can fine tune and correlate more things...
7. Currently it does not have a nose; maybe in the future we
can find a sensor that detects this! 
Exciting isn't it?
Actually with our prototypes we can measure:
Bees bidirectionally
Temp and humidity
Weight
Light intensity
So we tested all this and we are refining the alarm system
triggers as we learn more.  Since our
alarm system will be on the cloud, we can constantly fine tune it and develop
new alarms when enough data reveals more correlations to other events.
Hope this info is useful, will be glad to answer more
questions...",20.0,5,"1 Campaign

What's TheLRoom and a ""Mini Break""?
TheLRoomBNB (the ""L"" stands for Ladies)is a new, wonderful welcoming woman's space to relax and de-stress
""Mini Breaks"" are an EXPERIENCE that
every women should have. Women need regular ""Mini Breaks"" to relieve the pressure of always having to push thru at work or home in the interest of success and
pleasing others.  This pushing thru behavior is the cause of an increase
in woman's illnesses such as sleep and eating disorders, strokes, heart attacks, depression, and misplaced negative aggression towards co-workers and loved ones. 






TheLRoomBNB is being designed as a 21st
Century new paradigm in the Bed & Breakfast Industry. A group of visionary inter-generational, ethnic, and gender diverse women are spearheading this
project with E. Clement Swan, Founder. They realized that women needed
occasional relaxing ""Mini Breaks"".These ""Mini Breaks"" have positive long
lasting health and socialization benefits for women, their families and people
they interact with.






WHY DO WOMEN NEED TheLROOMBNB...Plus MINI BREAKS?


  Because it's a matter of life and death......

Nearly 50 percent of American women feel they don't have enough free time.

*Stress



*Diabetes - Heart Attacks - Strokes





Women with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than women without diabets.









Women account for just over half of the total heart disease deaths in the United States each year.




Approximately 55,000 more women than men have a stroke each year.


*Depression  


Women experience twice the rate of depression as men, regardless of race or ethnic background.


THE GOOD NEWS IS... With Your Donation Today to this campaign... Women will have
TheLRoomBNB to De-stress, Relax and Engage with their peers. 

Long range plans are to open LRooms in every major city.




 Although TheLRoom is for ladies, we value the men who care about
their wives, girlfriends, mothers, sisters, and all women. 

We are thankful that Men have also generously donated along with women. 



OUR LOCATION IS AMAZING!

Contact suppliers and acquire the materials (electronics, plastic injection moldings) necessary to assemble Growmotics on a large scale.
Ensure Growmotics is compliant with quality standards such as RoHS or the CE marking certificates.
Contacting experts to compile the most exhaustive Growpedia possible.
Reinforce server and web security.
   Risk And Challenges 
          We are positive about the plans for the future and the timeline we established. However it would be oblivious to ignore some factors that could influence the final outcome of our product.
          Our policy is to work only with good and trustworthy suppliers to provide us everything we need to build Growmotics. However we are dependent to a certain point on that suppliers and any delay in our supply chain could make some effect on the production timeline.
          Delays could also happen due to estimated delivery times. We will try our best to bring you Growmotics as soon as possible, but keep in mind that delivery times are just an estimation. So please be patient if you are expecting Growmotics and it takes a few days extra for you to receive it.
          Finally we want you to understand that our goal is to bring you the best product possible. That means an exhaustive control and testing stage. If we find some detail that needs to be polished and we have to push back the release date a little, our policy is to do whatever it takes for you and your plants to enjoy the best Growmotics possible.
          We’ll keep you informed through updates and if any issue arises you’ll be the first to know.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign
