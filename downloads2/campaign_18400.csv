<p>This is our final push to raise the funds to get to Almagro! We are due to land in less than two months, so every last penny helps us along the way. Read on to discover how you can help... </p>
<p><u><strong>About the Production</strong></u></p>
<p>Music and hearts are beating, and as the love stories are played out, a seemingly harmless prank goes horribly wrong resulting in a tragic fall from grace. </p>
<p> Our Twelfth Night is a direct response to our last show, Hamlet. As a company we have been immersed in expressing grief and trauma for the last two years and have now turned our creative forces toward love, music and romance. We finished Hamlet with the ghost of the drowned Ophelia speaking her own narrative to her brother, ‘I am drowned Laertes’. We begin Twelfth Night with the near drowned Viola as if picking up directly from where we left off. With the same actors - Francesca Zoutewelle and Finlay Cormack  - again playing brother and sister we are exploring, as Shakespeare did, where a narrative of courage and hope can lead us as the twins are reunited at the end of the play.</p>
<p><i>“The play seems as we read it to tremble perpetually on the brink of music”</i> Virginia Woolf </p>
<p>The show is performed by six young actors, who play all the music; they never leave the stage. Our tale explores love’s madness and our deep human need for music, whilst catching transgender inclinations, emotional transgressions and impossibly romantic reunions.</p>
<p><i>""Prove true, imagination oh prove true""</i> Viola Act 3 sc 4</p>
<p>With nothing but benches to sit on, instruments to play and costumes and props that may have been washed up on a beach, the actors create an authentic, funny and moving experience for a 21st Century audience.</p>

<p><u><strong>How to Get Involved</strong></u></p>
<p>We have been selected to perform at the Festival de Teatro Clásico de Almagro on Tuesday 25th July 2017 as part of the Almagro OFF. 150 companies applied, only 10 are chosen and only 4 are international- of which we are 1. This is an immensely exciting opportunity for Flute and this is where you come in. </p>
<p>In order to create Twelfth Night, and share our music, love, and joy with the world at large, we need your help. By becoming a Flute Angel, and donating today, you can become a part the extraordinary journey that Twelfth Night makes. </p>
<p>100% of each donation will go towards the creation and delivery of the production, and most importantly, enable us to reach and affect as wide an audience as possible.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a group of young, passionate and dedicated artists all hailing from the William Esper Studio in New York City.  Our love for Stephen Belber's TAPE came to fruition during our two years of training at the studio, after performing several scenes from the play in our classes.  From that point on, a fire was lit underneath us, and we were determined to stage a full production of TAPE after we graduated.</p>

<p>With your help, we are more than determined to make our dream a reality, and bring to life a story we are all very moved to share with the New York theater scene.<br/> </p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help!</h3>

We are a group of young, passionate and dedicated artists all hailing from the William Esper Studio in New York City.  Our love for Stephen Belber's TAPE came to fruition during our two years of training at the studio, after performing several scenes from the play in our classes.  From that point on, a fire was lit underneath us, and we were determined to stage a full production of TAPE after we graduated.

With your help, we are more than determined to make our dream a reality, and bring to life a story we are all very moved to share with the New York theater scene.

<p>Pour ce faire, Clown en Devenir s’implique avec l’organisme humanitaire Clowns Sans Frontières et va participer à des missions humanitaires pour faire des apparitions dans divers lieux, tels que: les hôpitaux, les orphelinats, les centres de retraite, les réserves autochtones, les camps de réfugiés, etc.</p>

<p><i>Revaluate artists' work through social, communal and environmental commitment.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>By way of Becoming Clown project, we hope to use art to serve society as a whole and to reach communities that sometimes have little to no access to art and culture in general.</i></p>
<p><i>To do so, Becoming Clown is getting involved with the humanitarian organization Clowns Without Borders and plans to participate to various humanitarian missions, appearing in many different places such as hospitals, orphanages, retirement centres, native reserves, refugee camps, etc.</i></p>
<p><i>Also, by promoting the conception of the show as made with recovered/recycled materials, the project wishes to encourage the respect of our environment.</i></p>

  C'EST QUOI?/ WHAT IS IT?
 Clown en Devenir désire vous présenter le fruit de ses efforts et vous invite à participer à ce collectif artistique né de la collaboration entre trois acadiens gradués du département d'art dramatique de l'Université de Moncton, N.-B.
Nous sommes présentement en période de création pour notre tout premier spectacle en salle:

                                                      Clown en Devenir
                                                    Au pays des Clowns
/
Becoming Clown wishes to present the _ and invites you to take part in this art collective born from the collaboration between three acadians graduated from the theatre department at Université de Moncton, NB.
We are currently in the creation process for our very first in-theatre show:
                                                       Becoming Clown
                                                         In Clown Land
             
Spectacle multidisciplinaire de 45 minutes offert à un public de tous âges disponible à partir de l’été 2016. Interprété par Audrey James Blanchard, Frédéric Melanson et Stéphanie L. Belanger.

De mai à juillet 2015, nous avons monté un spectacle-laboratoire d’une durée de 15 minutes lors de sessions de création avec Audrey James Blanchard et Stéphanie L. Belanger, dirigées par Frédéric Melanson.
Nous avons présenté notre laboratoire dans divers lieux et événements, tels que: La Tohu (QC), Le Festival du Cirque de Dieppe (N.-B.), La parade du père Noël à Montréal (QC), Carnaval Carmagnole (QC)...
Également, nous offrons en tout temps de l’animation lors d’événements communautaires et corporatifs.
/
A 45-minute multidisciplinary show offered to an audience of all ages, coming in summer 2016. Interpreted by Audrey James Blanchard, Frédéric Melanson and Stéphanie L. Belanger.

From May to July 2015, we put together a 15-minute laboratory/experimental show during creation sessions with Audrey James Blanchard and Stéphanie L. Belanger, directed by Frédéric Melanson.
We have presented the laboratory in many places and events, such as: La Tohu (QC), Le Festival du Cirque de Dieppe (NB), The Christmas parade in Montreal (QC), Carmagnole Carnival (QC)...
We also offer animation services at all times for communal or corporate events.


MISSION
Revaloriser le travail des artistes par l’engagement social, communautaire et environnemental.
Grâce au projet Clown en Devenir, nous souhaitons utiliser l’art au service de la société et rejoindre des communautés qui n’ont parfois peu ou pas d'accès à l’art et à la culture.
Pour ce faire, Clown en Devenir s’implique avec l’organisme humanitaire Clowns Sans Frontières et va participer à des missions humanitaires pour faire des apparitions dans divers lieux, tels que: les hôpitaux, les orphelinats, les centres de retraite, les réserves autochtones, les camps de réfugiés, etc.
Également, en promouvant la conception des décors faits à partir de matériaux récupérés, le projet souhaite encourager le respect de son environnement.
/
Revaluate artists' work through social, communal and environmental commitment.
By way of Becoming Clown project, we hope to use art to serve society as a whole and to reach communities that sometimes have little to no access to art and culture in general.
To do so, Becoming Clown is getting involved with the humanitarian organization Clowns Without Borders and plans to participate to various humanitarian missions, appearing in many different places such as hospitals, orphanages, retirement centres, native reserves, refugee camps, etc.
Also, by promoting the conception of the show as made with recovered/recycled materials, the project wishes to encourage the respect of our environment.

 INSPIRATION
Inspiré du jeu clownesque que l’on retrouve en Russie avec la famille Semianyki, du jeu corporel de Michel Courtemanche, du Muppet Show et d’Alice au pays des merveilles, ce spectacle est un voyage au coeur de soi. Puisqu’il n’y a pas deux clowns pareils, il n'y a donc pas un seul et unique pays de clown; chacune des réalités affrontées par nos trois personnages est totalement différente, représentative de leurs personnalités respectives.
Notre travail de création s’oriente vers un spectacle multidisplinaire qui inclut la marionnette, les acrobaties, le jeu clownesque/physique et la musique en direct.  
/
Inspired by the clown approach as presented in Russia by the Semianyki family, the physical theatre done by Michel Courtemanche, the Muppet Show and Alice in Wonderland, this show is a journey inside oneself. Since there are no two clowns alike, there is also no single Clown country; each of the realities confronted by our three characters is entirely different, representative of their respective personalities.
Our creation process is oriented towards a multidisciplinary act that includes puppetry, acrobatics, clownish/physical theatre and live music.

When I felt lonely, I would turn on Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and play for hours; solving dungeons and saving the world from Ganondorf's evil clutches. Video games hold a special place in my heart. With the production that we have, it warms my heart and makes me relive all of those moments that I hold near and dear. </p>
<p>And I know that I'm not alone. </p>
<p>After each show, we've had people hug us, thanking us for helping them relive their childhoods again.

Depending on your donation, we will give you: t-shirts, tickets, a meet-and-greet with the cast, autographed paraphernalia, an appearance at your party or event (up to 4 characters), or even a private performance! And, our thanks and love. <3    The Impact ""One of my most cherished childhood memories was playing Banjo-Kazooie and Mario Kart with my dad in the basement. My most cherished possession is a Pokemon Yellow Version that my younger brother saved up his quarters and dimes to buy me for my tenth birthday. When I felt lonely, I would turn on Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and play for hours; solving dungeons and saving the world from Ganondorf's evil clutches. Video games hold a special place in my heart. With the production that we have, it warms my heart and makes me relive all of those moments that I hold near and dear. 
And I know that I'm not alone. 
After each show, we've had people hug us, thanking us for helping them relive their childhoods again. We've had children tell us that we have inspired them to explore new and exciting games and stories. We've had adults congratulate us on capturing the excitement and joy that they felt all those years ago. 
Video games touch people's lives in more ways than one. We want to share that with you.""
- David Evan Stolworthy; co-creator of The Video Games. 
    Risks & Challenges ""We've been working on this production for over a year and have discovered many things about the project, ourselves, and others. Our production is something that has never been done before; partnering stage combat, improvisation, and audience-interaction to create an immersive experience that changes each night. 
We've also made a strong bond with the cast and crew of this production. Honestly, this is the most supportive, hardworking, and understanding group of people I have had the pleasure of working with! 
However, without proper funding, we will have to table this project for the time being. We're currently extended through the month of July for the Hollywood Fringe Festival 2015 after receiving two awards! We also received word that we have been accepted into the Charm City Fringe Festival (Baltimore, MD), Nerd Con (San Diego, CA), as well as Long Beach Comic-con (Long Beach, CA). We'd like to continue the momentum and even be able to tour the show across the country with state of the art costumes and weaponry. 
We need coins to continue, or it's GAME OVER.""

Our primary focal points are underserved populations and non-traditional theatergoers in order to introduce them to the power of the arts as a life changing force.

<p>In providing a risk-free environment of diversity, TFDT emphasizes the value of dance as a medium to enrich, empower and engage all members of the community via its high-quality, accessible and affordable programming.</p>
<p>As vanguard caretakers of the art form of ballet, we actively seek to promote new audiences and heighten their awareness and willingness to move away from “traditional and typical dance models”. With a responsible eye to the future of ballet, we work to provide a progressive and contemporary experience, with the understanding that ballet will not look as it once has.</p>
<p>The interwoven philosophical, societal and political issues of the 18th and 19th centuries, that once informed and governed the creation and understanding of new dance work and art in general, no longer exist.

<div>Hello!</div>
<div>Grace House Productions is very excited to take their inaugural show 'Gruesome Playground Injuries' by Rajiv Joseph to the Chicago Fringe! <br/><br/>

<p>After waving good-bye to foggy San Francisco and setting their sights on bright and sunny Los Angeles, four friends teamed up to combine theatre and film into one beautiful experiment. Thus Grace House Productions was born. With joy that can only be expressed by shouting to the heavens, they will be performing their labor of love in Chicago's Gift Theatre, September 5th, 6th, 11th, 12th, and 13th, 2015.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As the title implies, this show gives the audience an opportunity to see some seriously gruesome injuries. But not the ones you're thinking of! These are the physical and emotional injuries that we inflict on ourselves and each other every day. This play focuses on Dougie and Kayleen, two unlikely friends with a kindred spirit, and how the wounds they inflict on one another not only pave the road of their 30 year-long friendship, but also their lives.</span></p>
<div>So, you might be asking yourself, ""How does film fit into all of this?!"" Since the play spans 30 years, cinema (in the form of projections) will act as an interactive vessel so our audience feels like they have jumped through time with Dougie and Kayleen.</div>
<div>It is our sincerest wish that after we return from Chicago, we would love to take this show back on the road and spread the love around California in the cities that we know best: San Francisco and Los Angeles. <br/><br/>

of happiness - all important lessons on compassion and connection taught and
learned through the open arms of performing arts. </p>

aside a percentage of funds to put on performances and talkbacks at high schools (upperclassmen only!) throughout our run. 
We are really excited about this idea, as it would offer the
chance for students to see a professional production using two of the most
beloved forms of media -- theatre and film. Not only that, but the particular
play we have chosen to perform includes lessons on life, love, and the pursuit
of happiness - all important lessons on compassion and connection taught and
learned through the open arms of performing arts.

Photography by Alex Powell, at Warwick Arts Centre</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Making the Show</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>This year is the 30th anniversary of the Battle of the Beanfield, which we wanted to commemorate with a historical re-enactment. </b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>On route to begin the 1985 Stonehenge Free festival to celebrate the summer solstice, the Peace Convoy of new-age travellers suffered a brutal assault by the police. It had been co-ordinated by Thatcher's government to uphold an injunction around the stones and to break the travellers' movement.</div><div><br/></div><div>The police set-up road blocks and attacked vehicles, eventually chasing them off the road into a farmer's beanfield in Wiltshire. There, police burned travellers' mobile homes, took their children into social services, and made the largest civil arrest since World War II. It was a huge display of police brutality resulting in hundreds of arrests but zero convictions. There has never been an official inquiry. <br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our show features interviews with a journalist, a police officer, a traveller and an author of a book on the Beanfield, each of whom give their perspective on the events of that day to help inform our re-enactment as we endeavour to recreate an event that affected hundreds with only a six person ensemble on location in Wiltshire.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>During our show, we also try to give the audience an experience of the Stonehenge summer solstice in 2015 - a police-sanctioned but de-politicised night of revelry around the famous rocks. </div><div><br/></div><div>We need your help to take the production to the Edinburgh Fringe. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<div>We've all put a lot of time, love and money into this project but in this final stretch we need your help! </div>

<div>Our target is £500, which will contribute towards venue hire, marketing the show, and technical costs. </div>

<div><b>Venue Hire</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>From 7th-22nd August we're performing at The Space on the Mile at the Edinburgh Fringe, and need your help to cover the venue hire. </div>

<div>
<b>Marketing</b> </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Marketing is a vital part of any Edinburgh show. The company will be taking to the streets every day to flyer festival-goers to make sure we can share the show with the greatest number of people possible, and we need help covering the cost of materials to make this happen. </div>

<div><b>The Perks </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>Not only are we offering you eternal gratitude, friendship and love - but a wide range of perks to say thank you for your generous donations. From postcards to t-shirts featuring our gorgeous publicity (by Antoine) to live show stills from our Warwick Arts Centre performance (taken by Alex Powell) and access to video content which our 50-minute running time demanded be cut (shot by our very own co-director Dorothy). </div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span>The Beanfield has had developed through showings at Warwick Arts Centre and Theatre 503's Edinburgh preview season. </span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div>Have a watch of the Vimeo link above for reactions to the Warwick show. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Audiences have responded so positively to the project and it has provoked discussion and outrage about what happened at the Beanfield. This show could really make a difference, exposing people to what happened in 1985 and asking to audiences reflect on police brutality and their own civil liberties. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Because, we get it. You might not be in a place to contribute but that doesn't mean you can't help. If you're as passionate about the project as we are help us get our campaign out there by sharing the link. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The show itself needs an audience so it'd be fantastic if you could share our Facebook events, trailer and videos.</div>

</div><div>This is such an important project to us, any help you could give us would make the world of difference. </div><div><br/></div><div>

Photography by Alex Powell, at Warwick Arts CentreMaking the ShowThis year is the 30th anniversary of the Battle of the Beanfield, which we wanted to commemorate with a historical re-enactment. On route to begin the 1985 Stonehenge Free festival to celebrate the summer solstice, the Peace Convoy of new-age travellers suffered a brutal assault by the police. It had been co-ordinated by Thatcher's government to uphold an injunction around the stones and to break the travellers' movement.The police set-up road blocks and attacked vehicles, eventually chasing them off the road into a farmer's beanfield in Wiltshire. There, police burned travellers' mobile homes, took their children into social services, and made the largest civil arrest since World War II. It was a huge display of police brutality resulting in hundreds of arrests but zero convictions. There has never been an official inquiry. 
Our show features interviews with a journalist, a police officer, a traveller and an author of a book on the Beanfield, each of whom give their perspective on the events of that day to help inform our re-enactment as we endeavour to recreate an event that affected hundreds with only a six person ensemble on location in Wiltshire.During our show, we also try to give the audience an experience of the Stonehenge summer solstice in 2015 - a police-sanctioned but de-politicised night of revelry around the famous rocks. We need your help to take the production to the Edinburgh Fringe. 
What We Need & What You Get

We've all put a lot of time, love and money into this project but in this final stretch we need your help! 

Our target is £500, which will contribute towards venue hire, marketing the show, and technical costs. 

Venue Hire

From 7th-22nd August we're performing at The Space on the Mile at the Edinburgh Fringe, and need your help to cover the venue hire. 



Marketing 

Marketing is a vital part of any Edinburgh show. The company will be taking to the streets every day to flyer festival-goers to make sure we can share the show with the greatest number of people possible, and we need help covering the cost of materials to make this happen. 


Technical Support

The show blends live performance with film footage and in order to deliver these elements to a high quality, we have to cover certain costs including lighting, and a transportable screen. Your donation would contribute to the hire of this equipment.

The Perks 

Not only are we offering you eternal gratitude, friendship and love - but a wide range of perks to say thank you for your generous donations. From postcards to t-shirts featuring our gorgeous publicity (by Antoine) to live show stills from our Warwick Arts Centre performance (taken by Alex Powell) and access to video content which our 50-minute running time demanded be cut (shot by our very own co-director Dorothy).    
The Impact

The Beanfield has had developed through showings at Warwick Arts Centre and Theatre 503's Edinburgh preview season. 

Have a watch of the Vimeo link above for reactions to the Warwick show. 

Audiences have responded so positively to the project and it has provoked discussion and outrage about what happened at the Beanfield. This show could really make a difference, exposing people to what happened in 1985 and asking to audiences reflect on police brutality and their own civil liberties. 

  Other Ways You Can Help

Because, we get it. You might not be in a place to contribute but that doesn't mean you can't help. If you're as passionate about the project as we are help us get our campaign out there by sharing the link. 

The show itself needs an audience so it'd be fantastic if you could share our Facebook events, trailer and videos.

This is such an important project to us, any help you could give us would make the world of difference.

Aujourd’hui, nous avons besoin d’un dernier coup de pouce pour aller jusqu'au bout de ce cycle de présentations. Votre appui nous permettrait d'atteindre notre objectif final, de mener ce projet à son succès!Vos contributions appuieront tous les membres de l’équipe d’Alan Lake Factori(e), afin que tous les collaborateurs puissent être rémunérés à leurs justes valeurs. Le milieu de la danse à Québec est en pleine effervescence, et il le restera tant que les projets qui y prennent forme seront diversifiés. Alan Lake Factori(e) participe à la richesse de ce terreau fertile. Votre aide encouragera par la même le renouveau chorégraphique, tout en contribuant à maintenir active cette dynamique créatrice dans la ville de Québec.
L'équipe Alan Lake Factori(e) pour Ravages, c'est :Chorégraphe: Alan Lake, avec la complicité des interprètesInterprètes: Dominic Caron, David Rancourt, Esther Rousseau-Morin et Arielle Warnke St-PierreConseillère artistique: Annie GagnonScénographe: Julie LévesqueCompositeur: Antoine BerthiaumeConcepteur lumière: François MarceauConcepteur vidéo: Louis-Robert Bouchard Direction de la photographie: François GamacheMonteur : Jason ArbourColoriste : Éric DenisDirection Technique : Antoine Caron

Graphiste: Isabelle LapierreCommunications: Ariane Plante et Marion Gotti



Après le succès de ses
précédentes, la nouvelle œuvre d’Alan Lake, Ravages, pousse encore
plus loin le langage artistique de son créateur. Déterminante dans son cheminement, cette création apparaît comme un tournant majeur dans son parcours en tant que chorégraphe. Sa narration abstraite invite le
spectateur à plonger dans un univers brut, mais fragile, une épopée symbolique
à la croisée du périssable et de l’immuable.

<p>This world-premiere of CULT MODEL began as a stand-up show Fales called CULT! written while bored out his mind on days off during a ten-week run of “Confessions of a Mormon Boy” at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami in 2003. Later that summer he performed it as a presentation at the 2003 Sunstone Symposium in Salt Lake City (the Mormon International Fringe Festival) and was performed as a benefit for the Utah AIDS Foundation at Wise Guys Comedy Club before being shelved. Fales found the hostility against him so great that he was afraid that he would be kept from seeing his children as the non-custodial parent if he continued to perform it. At the time, his ex-wife was raising the children very Latter-day Saint. He also had a few more cults to try before letting them all go. Now that the children are grown, the gloves are coming off. He’s fighting for all of us to kick our cult habits and learn to think and act for ourselves.</p>
<p>Fales quips, “There’s not a cult I haven’t tried . . . or wanted to. Today I’m cult free. I feel pretty naked. But that might not be such a bad thing. Still, I’m looking for a new cult. Are you it?""</p>
<p>Steven Fales is an award-winning veteran of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, two New York International Fringe Festivals (Overall Excellence Award), the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival (Oscar Wilde Award Nomination), Atlantic Fringe Festival (Overall Fringe Hit Award), Acts of Faith Festival and countless others.</p>
<p>This is the first of many 60-minute solo shows he is working on including “When All Else Fales” and “Simply Undetectable”. His 90-minute solo plays in “Mormon Boy Trilogy” include “Confessions of a Mormon Boy”, “Missionary Position” and “Prodigal Dad”. His cabaret acts include “Mormon American Princess” and “Mormon American Cowboy”. He has performed his work from Lincoln Center to Joe’s Pub; from Halifax to Houston; from London to Los Angeles. He received an Outer Critics’ Circle Award Nomination for the off-Broadway run of “Confessions of a Mormon Boy” at the SoHo Playhouse. Fales holds an MFA in acting from the University of Connecticut.

<p>Taking the show to the Fringe is hard (masochistic) work, but it’s where we’ve had so many of our breaks as a company. This will be
our fourth show at the Fringe and the festival’s capacity to provoke and shock
and seduce still takes us by surprise. It’s a place full of clowns and acrobats
and a cappella groups (so many) and gritty urban monologues and taiko drummers
and also critics and theatre programmers and festival promoters. It’s where the
world can see our show and it’s essential for the long, long, long life of 64 SQUARES (we hope). </p>

This going to Edinburgh malarkey is an expensive business,
but for our company it’s a rather essential showcase for our work. As such, by
pledging your support to Rhum and Clay, you’d be paying for lots of really useful things. This is the
breakdown. Prepare for numbers in…
3...
2...
1...




Because we like you and you like us enough to support our
project, it’s only right that we give something in return. We’re offering some
lovely ‘perks’ ranging from a thank you to the opportunity to play chess
against one of us (none of us are amazing at it, so there’s a good chance of a
self-esteem boost for you included in the package)



Taking the show to the Fringe is hard (masochistic) work, but it’s where we’ve had so many of our breaks as a company. This will be
our fourth show at the Fringe and the festival’s capacity to provoke and shock
and seduce still takes us by surprise. It’s a place full of clowns and acrobats
and a cappella groups (so many) and gritty urban monologues and taiko drummers
and also critics and theatre programmers and festival promoters. It’s where the
world can see our show and it’s essential for the long, long, long life of 64 SQUARES (we hope).",8.0,0,"3 Campaigns

One day a

behaviour. One day I fell over wearing a giant bear suit. Life can change, our
genes can change, our minds can change. Let’s talk. 
Amy wonders if she’s mental. She wonders this a lot. She’s not sure
if this is a politically correct thing to say out loud – but she has been told that talking
definitely helps. When Amy was four, her father jumped in front of a train. The
event bleeds into her present, leaving a trail of half memories about the man that was; a legacy of wonder.

<p>There are few buildings in Lincoln that can provoke more nostalgic affection than The Ritz Cinema on Lincoln’s High Street, both due to the appeal of the older and more charming generations of cinematic masterpieces that were shown at the venue, and the realisation it may well be Lincoln’s finest architectural example of a classic Art Deco building.</p>
<p>Many of Lincoln’s old cinemas were unremarkable and quickly declined into nothing but distant memories of buildings that once were, but The Ritz has remained and stood the test of time.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Laying dormant for well over a decade, the building housed the dust covered remains of the original cinema on the upper floors, and has slowly been brought back to life once again with the dreams and ambitions of The Ritz Team, working with the local community, to realise a future which brings this magnificent building back to life as a fully operation period cinematic experience, and community hub for Lincoln’s High Street once again.</p>
<p>We are now 4 years down the line, and the building has had all manner of renovations completed, thanks to a dedicated team of volunteers and help from local businesses (the gallery link at the top of the page has some videos from the early days which give an idea of how much of a state the building was in at the start of the project).</p>

<div>Over the last 2 years or so, we have had many fund-raising screenings of classic films, as well as special events and high profile guest appearances and intimate ""Q&amp;A"" sessions, and even live music, and the profit from these has enabled us to keep the renovation slowly moving forward. However, there is still a lot to be done, both in the public areas and the ""behind the scenes"" areas that most people will never see, so the renovation project is still very much ongoing. As we do not receive any income in the form of grants or help from any other public bodies, the only source of funds we currently have is the income from the cinema and our retail area. We are staffed by volunteers, so all the money we make goes straight back into the renovation and running of the building, We always strive to keep our screenings and events as cheap as possible so that we are accessible to the widest audience possible, however the downside of that is that we make very little profit to reinvest into the building from many of our screenings &amp; events, and screenings with poor attendance can easily make a loss.
</div>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>For the last 3 years we have been running our screenings from a 15 year old projector that is neither as bright as we would like, nor as high resolution as we would like (another reason for keeping our tickets cheap - we are fully aware that our projection and sound is not up to the level of a commercial cinema), and cannot play direct from a Blu-ray player or allow us to use a PS4 or XboxOne for gaming nights. We are well overdue for an upgrade, however projectors are very expensive so this is where you come in....... <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>We are fully aware that raising the amount of money needed to get a new (or nearly new) projector with the specs we need is unattainable - most commercial full HD projectors of the size we need would cost us at least 20 to 30 thousand pounds. However, if we go for something a bit older from a specialist second-hand dealer, then we can get what we need for a fraction of the price.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After doing a bit of research, and shopping around on the internet, we think we've found a projector that suits our purposes, and should,depending on the supplier, cost us in the region of £4000 to £4200. As all donations are subject to fees both to Indiegogo and the payment provider, which come to around 8 to 10% of every donation, we have decided to set the goal of our fundraising campaign at £4500 (as it's a nice round number)<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We have tried to come up with as wide a range of perks as possible to cover both a good range of donation amounts, as well as a range of cinema-related perks that will hopefully appeal to newcomers as well as our regulars. We've also included some corporate perks, so any small (or large) businesses out there that would like to contribute and get their business advertised on our big screen, there are some options for you as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We have gone for the flexible-funding approach so that even if we don't attain or target, we will still get to use your donations and you still get to use your perks. If this happens, then we will still be upgrading the projector, but we will have to set our sights a little lower. If, however, we manage to exceed our funding goal, then we have the possibility of going for a more expensive projector, and/or purchasing spare bulbs (most projectors at this level have multiple bulbs that costs £100's of pounds each) and cabling etc. If we manage to raise significantly more than our initial target, then we will look at the possibility of upgrading our cinema speakers to improve our sound quality. Whatever happens, will keep everyone updated on what we are intending to buy and where the additional funds will be going, if applicable.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>A newer, more powerful projector will enable us to show films (subject to the original source) in Full HD for the first time. It will also enable us to show films direct from Blu-Ray sources, as well allowing us to use PS4 and XBoxOne consoles for gaming parties for the first time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The increase in both brightness and contrast levels will further increase the picture quality, bringing us that much closer to the levels of a mainstream cinema, and the newer technology will mean more flexibility with regards to what we can do and the facilities we can offer for private hiring and conferences. It should also as future-proof us for the foreseeable future, as the bulbs and spares are become increasingly difficult and/or expensive to obtain for our ageing current projector.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Raising the funds this way also means that we can continue to keep our ticket and hiring costs as low as possible rather than increasing them to generate additional funds, while still being able to upgrade our equipment - a win for us (we get new stuff, yay!), and a win for you (tickets stay cheap!)</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We fully appreciate that some people may not be able to spare any money to donate to our campaign, or that some people are not comfortable sending money over the internet. That doesn't mean you can't help us, however, so here are some of the other ways you can contribute to us achieving our goal (and for those of you that have donated, please feel free to help us out as well!):</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Share this page - campaigns like this are only successful if people know about them. Share this page with your friends and contacts, and if you are that way inclined, keep sharing it!</li>
<li>Share our posts on Facebook/Twitter - if you are not already following us on Facebook and/or Twitter, use the links at the bottom of this page. Whenever you see a post about this campaign, share it and retweet it (and even if you don't see a new post, feel free to find an old one and share that!)</li>
<li>Talk about the campaign and/or the cinema to your friends and family</li>
<li>If you work for a local business that might be interested in one of the corporate perks as a way of getting some local advertising, share the campaign with them</li>
</ul>
<div>Or, just check out our upcoming films and events, and buy some tickets on the link below (don't forget to bookmark it for easy access) - all money raised from ticket sales and food &amp; drink sales goes straight back into the ongoing renovation and running of the cinema.</div>

We are staffed by volunteers, so all the money we make goes straight back into the renovation and running of the building, We always strive to keep our screenings and events as cheap as possible so that we are accessible to the widest audience possible, however the downside of that is that we make very little profit to reinvest into the building from many of our screenings & events, and screenings with poor attendance can easily make a loss.

   What We Need & What You Get
For the last 3 years we have been running our screenings from a 15 year old projector that is neither as bright as we would like, nor as high resolution as we would like (another reason for keeping our tickets cheap - we are fully aware that our projection and sound is not up to the level of a commercial cinema), and cannot play direct from a Blu-ray player or allow us to use a PS4 or XboxOne for gaming nights. We are well overdue for an upgrade, however projectors are very expensive so this is where you come in....... 


 
We are fully aware that raising the amount of money needed to get a new (or nearly new) projector with the specs we need is unattainable - most commercial full HD projectors of the size we need would cost us at least 20 to 30 thousand pounds. However, if we go for something a bit older from a specialist second-hand dealer, then we can get what we need for a fraction of the price.

After doing a bit of research, and shopping around on the internet, we think we've found a projector that suits our purposes, and should,depending on the supplier, cost us in the region of £4000 to £4200. As all donations are subject to fees both to Indiegogo and the payment provider, which come to around 8 to 10% of every donation, we have decided to set the goal of our fundraising campaign at £4500 (as it's a nice round number)


We have tried to come up with as wide a range of perks as possible to cover both a good range of donation amounts, as well as a range of cinema-related perks that will hopefully appeal to newcomers as well as our regulars. We've also included some corporate perks, so any small (or large) businesses out there that would like to contribute and get their business advertised on our big screen, there are some options for you as well.

We have gone for the flexible-funding approach so that even if we don't attain or target, we will still get to use your donations and you still get to use your perks. If this happens, then we will still be upgrading the projector, but we will have to set our sights a little lower. If, however, we manage to exceed our funding goal, then we have the possibility of going for a more expensive projector, and/or purchasing spare bulbs (most projectors at this level have multiple bulbs that costs £100's of pounds each) and cabling etc. If we manage to raise significantly more than our initial target, then we will look at the possibility of upgrading our cinema speakers to improve our sound quality. Whatever happens, will keep everyone updated on what we are intending to buy and where the additional funds will be going, if applicable.
   The Impact
 
A newer, more powerful projector will enable us to show films (subject to the original source) in Full HD for the first time. It will also enable us to show films direct from Blu-Ray sources, as well allowing us to use PS4 and XBoxOne consoles for gaming parties for the first time.

The increase in both brightness and contrast levels will further increase the picture quality, bringing us that much closer to the levels of a mainstream cinema, and the newer technology will mean more flexibility with regards to what we can do and the facilities we can offer for private hiring and conferences. It should also as future-proof us for the foreseeable future, as the bulbs and spares are become increasingly difficult and/or expensive to obtain for our ageing current projector.

Raising the funds this way also means that we can continue to keep our ticket and hiring costs as low as possible rather than increasing them to generate additional funds, while still being able to upgrade our equipment - a win for us (we get new stuff, yay!), and a win for you (tickets stay cheap!)


    Other Ways You Can Help We fully appreciate that some people may not be able to spare any money to donate to our campaign, or that some people are not comfortable sending money over the internet. That doesn't mean you can't help us, however, so here are some of the other ways you can contribute to us achieving our goal (and for those of you that have donated, please feel free to help us out as well!):

<p>Acknowledging that
we live in a society where the people with less or no economic
privilege never get to participate, watch, witness, savour sincere
art forms due to the unavailability of the same-- we, a group of five
women are shaping up an alternative dance theatre production which
aims to speak against the rules, the norms that are put around our
body, perception and behavior through a new language of performance.
It aims to challenge the established norms of what is dance and what
is not. The tickets will have no fixed price-- the audience gets to
decide it, in that they would also engage directly with the art
created.</p>

Why is It Important to Create a New Language of Movement
If they see breasts and long hair coming, they call it woman, if beard and whiskers, they call it man: but, look, the self that hovers in between is neither mannor woman O Ramanatha!

<p><i>Cracked</i> was inspired by Marcus Salley's family after the death of his grandfather. The first part of a trilogy, <i>Cracked</i> looks at the early days of his grandparents relationship. Gale McDonald and, self-proclaimed One-Man Motorcyle Gang, Willie ""Chick"" Brown are complete opposites, but after a wonderful a night out on the town, the two young lovers are brought together are put a journey that threatens to show their family the pits of hell for generations to come. </p>
<p>Audience reactions of its Virginia based premiere were very strong with many demanded that the sequel premiere the following summer! Audiences who saw the play were amazed by the quality of its writing and wanted to know what happened to these characters who they grew to love in just an hour after their tragic ending.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The cost of performing at Fringe can be steep for our cast members who are giving up their free time to participate in the festival on top of regular rehearsals. While the benefits are high, we are looking to help our actors out in any way we can by raising funds to take care of<b> transportation on the metro or gas money</b> (DC is an hour commute on a good day), <b>food for those days when they will have to miss lunch or dinner</b>, <b>transportation of the set</b>,<b> advertising </b>(our largest purchase), <b>props </b>and<b> guaranteed payment for both cast and crew</b>.</p>
<p>No matter how much money we receive, all donations will go to the production of the play. To your right, you will find a variety of different tokens of appreciation for donating!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In today's society, there are few opportunities to tell a story as black theatre artists. <i>Cracked</i> is a play that not only showcases the talents of black artists of different ages, but also tells a truly American story that can be shared by ALL races. </p>
<p>Your donations will help a young black playwright let his voice be heard and a story about what it means to protect your family be witnessed by a much larger audience than what the cast and crew have experienced. </p>
<p>Help make the change we want to see within the entertainment world!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The Rude Mechanicals are very small company that strives to put on multiple shows every year. The summer is our biggest season and the quality of our shows needs to reflect how far we have come. </p>
<p>The DC audience can either love us or hate us. These donations will help us make the best show that we can and get it recognized at a much larger level.</p>

Cracked was inspired by Marcus Salley's family after the death of his grandfather. The first part of a trilogy, Cracked looks at the early days of his grandparents relationship. Gale McDonald and, self-proclaimed One-Man Motorcyle Gang, Willie ""Chick"" Brown are complete opposites, but after a wonderful a night out on the town, the two young lovers are brought together are put a journey that threatens to show their family the pits of hell for generations to come. 
Audience reactions of its Virginia based premiere were very strong with many demanded that the sequel premiere the following summer! Audiences who saw the play were amazed by the quality of its writing and wanted to know what happened to these characters who they grew to love in just an hour after their tragic ending.   What We Need & What You Get The cost of performing at Fringe can be steep for our cast members who are giving up their free time to participate in the festival on top of regular rehearsals. While the benefits are high, we are looking to help our actors out in any way we can by raising funds to take care of transportation on the metro or gas money (DC is an hour commute on a good day), food for those days when they will have to miss lunch or dinner, transportation of the set, advertising (our largest purchase), props and guaranteed payment for both cast and crew.
No matter how much money we receive, all donations will go to the production of the play. To your right, you will find a variety of different tokens of appreciation for donating!
    The Impact In today's society, there are few opportunities to tell a story as black theatre artists. Cracked is a play that not only showcases the talents of black artists of different ages, but also tells a truly American story that can be shared by ALL races. 
Your donations will help a young black playwright let his voice be heard and a story about what it means to protect your family be witnessed by a much larger audience than what the cast and crew have experienced. 
Help make the change we want to see within the entertainment world!
    Risks & Challenges The Rude Mechanicals are very small company that strives to put on multiple shows every year. The summer is our biggest season and the quality of our shows needs to reflect how far we have come. 
The DC audience can either love us or hate us. These donations will help us make the best show that we can and get it recognized at a much larger level.

</div><div>  My name is S. Christopher Boggs. I have been an actor/director/producer and writer within the Little Rock theatre community for a number of years. In late January of 2014, I came up with a crazy idea for a play and pitched it to my wife. She loved it and encouraged me to start fleshing the story out. Roughly a month later, ""The Winning Numbers"" (TWN) was finished. I reluctantly put the script down for a while, but then quickly picked it up again and began fine tuning it.  It has been my good fortune to be a member of Community Theatre of Little Rock (CTLR) and even more fortunate that TWN was considered for their 2014-15 season. </div><div> The weekend of April 24th-26th 2015, TWN will have its World Premiere performances at The Studio Theatre, where Community Theatre of Little Rock currently performs. A special VIP show will be held on April 23rd. I can not tell you how excited, nervous, elated and stressed out I have been over the past year and how excited, nervous, elated and stressed I am about the next four months (FOUR MONTHS - AHHHHH!!!). </div><div>   The cast and crew of ""The Winning Numbers"", along with Community Theatre of Little Rock, are seeking support from donors like you. Donation will go to help offset the cost of building our set, purchasing costume pieces and props, handling publicity, etc., so that all of the revenue from the actual production can go directly to Community Theatre of Little Rock. CTLR will be celebrating its 60th season here in Central Arkansas. The revenue generated from this production will give an added boost to the quality of shows we plan for the 60th and beyond.</div><p> If you have been involved in theatre on any level, you know that sets are used and reused again and again. The wear and tear on set flats, staircases, furniture, props, costumes, etc. can be very costly to the budget. So, new flats, among other necessary items, will help refresh the look and feel of future productions for years to come.   It is my hope, that the funds we raise here on IndieGoGo for this show will help provide CTLR with new flats, furniture and other needed essentials that they haven't had for a number of years. </p><p>So your donations will help us two fold: We will be able to have flats, furniture, etc. for our World Premiere Production of ""The Winning Numbers"" and CTLR will have new equipment to use for many years to come. </p><p></p><h3>

Omm</u><br/></p>
<p>Zata Omm is an acronym for ‘Zen And The
Actualization Of Modern Movement’. The company is in a state of constant
development with ongoing artistic research to explore the artistic climate,
reflect contemporary culture and lead the emerging artistic trends. Zata Omm’s
objective is to create multidisciplinary contemporary dance works using
meaningful integration of dance, technology and other art forms on stage in
order to provide an alternative way of seeing our world, which facilitates our
exploration and understanding of the human condition. Zata Omm is a
forward-thinking dance company with a unique and compelling aesthetic style and
is renowned for its ability to humanize technical and technological elements in
dance to create a deep impact and connection with audiences. Our creations are
thought-provoking, and often express profound messages or revelations which are
valuable contributions to our artistic discipline. Artistic Director William
Yong has created more than 60 dance works which have been presented in major
venues and festivals worldwide.</p>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>This remarkable conceptual work of a self-fuelled
dance show will impact upon the practices of other theatrical organizations, as
well as general public's attention to sustainability and reflect our lives.
Through the choices and the collaborative effort that constructs the work, we
will challenge the dancers and our audiences to discover revelatory
perspectives of the future of our planet. <i>vox:lumen</i>
is intended to be exploratory, imaginative and visually innovative. It will
challenge the aesthetic boundaries of the theatre by integrating the dance,
auditory, technology and visual elements of the performance in novel ways. It
will compel audiences to consider how we might leave a healthier city, nation
and planet for our descendants.</p>
<p>The idea of a 'self-sustained-show' is one that
leaps beyond being a mere production. The potential and afterlife of the piece
is significant on both an artistic level and an environmental level. We are
committed to sharing knowledge from this experience and on-going research by
establishing an educational platform through which we will perform outreach
among youth, artists and technologists. We will be starting an important
dialogue among the arts, environmental and ecological sectors. We want to
demonstrate this concept of sustainability for our future, in the theatrical
community and beyond. A special Energy Fair will be set up onsite outside the
theatre to educate and harvest energy for the production of <i>vox:lumen</i><span>. The energy fair will be an educational and interactive
experience complementing the final production.</span></p>
<p>With its constructive, environmentally
responsible, and innovative elements evokes the essential spirit that <i>vox:lumen</i> employs an innovative and
creative approach to promoting adaptability and sustainability.<br/></p>

We at Zata Omm Dance Projects are raising funds to support the world premiere of our upcoming new full-length contemporary dance production, vox:lumen, which will premiere on the 4th to the 7th of March 2015 as part of World Stage at Harbourfront Centre Theatre in Toronto, Canada.
Born of a multi-year creative partnership with ground-breaking researchers at York University and interactive designers Aesthetec Studio, vox:lumen is a formal experiment of the most absolute practicality: a show powered by the idea of sustainability. Lit from energy created by the dancers, the audience and renewable sources, vox:lumen confronts the audience with the most elemental metaphor for understanding – the light we make ourselves. Photo-voltaic solar panels and inverters are set up outside the theatre daytime all week to harvest energy for the production of vox:lumen. A special Energy Fair will be set up in the theatre lobby to educate and encourage public to contribute kinetic energy to vox:lumen’s energy needs . This energy fair will be an educational and interactive experience complementing the final production.
vox:lumen explores a future in which human labour produces energy, and the pleasure of movement integrates technology into the social sphere.  It is about responsibility, adaptability, resilience and sustainability. The 'Will' to move forward...
What Your Funds Will Help Us Achieve

At this stage, we are facing our biggest challenge, as we integrate renewable forms of energy capture. Now we need your help more than ever to make our dream of a greener art world a reality.
Your support for our project will strengthen an important campaign towards green energy and sustainability in the Canadian art world. In addition, you will fuel our Energy Fair equipment and hard-wares, as well as its transportation, and you will be helping us loco-mote through essential hours rehearsal time, artists fees, technical staff fees, rehearsal studio rental fees, and the application of the sustainable energy itself.
Who We Are: Zata
Omm
Zata Omm is an acronym for ‘Zen And The
Actualization Of Modern Movement’. The company is in a state of constant
development with ongoing artistic research to explore the artistic climate,
reflect contemporary culture and lead the emerging artistic trends. Zata Omm’s
objective is to create multidisciplinary contemporary dance works using
meaningful integration of dance, technology and other art forms on stage in
order to provide an alternative way of seeing our world, which facilitates our
exploration and understanding of the human condition. Zata Omm is a
forward-thinking dance company with a unique and compelling aesthetic style and
is renowned for its ability to humanize technical and technological elements in
dance to create a deep impact and connection with audiences. Our creations are
thought-provoking, and often express profound messages or revelations which are
valuable contributions to our artistic discipline. Artistic Director William
Yong has created more than 60 dance works which have been presented in major
venues and festivals worldwide.
The Impact
This remarkable conceptual work of a self-fuelled
dance show will impact upon the practices of other theatrical organizations, as
well as general public's attention to sustainability and reflect our lives.
Through the choices and the collaborative effort that constructs the work, we
will challenge the dancers and our audiences to discover revelatory
perspectives of the future of our planet. vox:lumen
is intended to be exploratory, imaginative and visually innovative. It will
challenge the aesthetic boundaries of the theatre by integrating the dance,
auditory, technology and visual elements of the performance in novel ways. It
will compel audiences to consider how we might leave a healthier city, nation
and planet for our descendants.
The idea of a 'self-sustained-show' is one that
leaps beyond being a mere production. The potential and afterlife of the piece
is significant on both an artistic level and an environmental level. We are
committed to sharing knowledge from this experience and on-going research by
establishing an educational platform through which we will perform outreach
among youth, artists and technologists. We will be starting an important
dialogue among the arts, environmental and ecological sectors. We want to
demonstrate this concept of sustainability for our future, in the theatrical
community and beyond. A special Energy Fair will be set up onsite outside the
theatre to educate and harvest energy for the production of vox:lumen. The energy fair will be an educational and interactive
experience complementing the final production.
With its constructive, environmentally
responsible, and innovative elements evokes the essential spirit that vox:lumen employs an innovative and
creative approach to promoting adaptability and sustainability.

</div><p>Since 1999, Hollywood Hits Theater has been an alternative
to the sprawling megaplex movie experience. 
With its easy parking, friendly staff, and lower prices, Hollywood Hits
has a loyal customer base that appreciates what we can offer over other local
theaters.</p>
<p>However, there has been one comment from our customers above
all others:</p>
<p>“When are you getting new seats?”</p>
<p>New seats have been the #1 request from our customers,
practically since we opened.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And now,
we’re doing something about it.</span></p>
<p>Hollywood Hits is finalizing the contract with Seating
Concepts to provide NEW SEATING for all of its theaters, and now you can help!</p>
<p>With your donation, we can finally fulfill our customers’
biggest re quest.</p>
<p><b>THE SEATS</b></p>
<p>The seats come from Seating Concepts, Inc., a leading
designer and manufacturer of movie theater seating.  We have decided to go with a style that we
feel is both comfortable and durable. 
The seats are a combination of cloth and vinyl, which will make them a
vast upgrade over our current seating, as well as easy to clean and maintain.</p>
<p>In addition to the new chairs, we will be redesigning our
seating layout in the theaters to allow for easier access.  No more will you be forced to stand when
someone wants to get by.</p><p>These seats represent a $250,000 investment, and are the first stage in a multistep renovation, which will eventually include the redesigning and rebranding of the theater. </p>
<p><b>WHEN ARE THEY BEING INSTALLED?</b></p>
<p>Our current goal is to install the seats through the month
of September, with all the theaters fully converted to the new seating by
October.  We are currently finalizing the new seating layout, as well as the permitting required for such a renovation.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WILL YOUR MONEY BE FOR</b></p>
<p>The seats have already been ordered.  However, the cost of installing them, as well

to the sprawling megaplex movie experience. 
With its easy parking, friendly staff, and lower prices, Hollywood Hits
has a loyal customer base that appreciates what we can offer over other local
theaters.
However, there has been one comment from our customers above
all others:
“When are you getting new seats?”
New seats have been the #1 request from our customers,
practically since we opened.  And now,
we’re doing something about it.
Hollywood Hits is finalizing the contract with Seating
Concepts to provide NEW SEATING for all of its theaters, and now you can help!
With your donation, we can finally fulfill our customers’
biggest re quest.
THE SEATS
The seats come from Seating Concepts, Inc., a leading
designer and manufacturer of movie theater seating.  We have decided to go with a style that we
feel is both comfortable and durable. 
The seats are a combination of cloth and vinyl, which will make them a
vast upgrade over our current seating, as well as easy to clean and maintain.
In addition to the new chairs, we will be redesigning our
seating layout in the theaters to allow for easier access.  No more will you be forced to stand when
someone wants to get by.These seats represent a $250,000 investment, and are the first stage in a multistep renovation, which will eventually include the redesigning and rebranding of the theater. 
WHEN ARE THEY BEING INSTALLED?
Our current goal is to install the seats through the month
of September, with all the theaters fully converted to the new seating by
October.  We are currently finalizing the new seating layout, as well as the permitting required for such a renovation.
WHAT WILL YOUR MONEY BE FOR
The seats have already been ordered.  However, the cost of installing them, as well
as updating the décor in the theater and hallways, is still not covered.  Hitting our goal of $50,000 will allow us to
finalize the installation of our new seats, with stretch goals to cover the
installation of new carpeting and lighting.We hope that you see this investment as we see it - an investment not just in some new chairs, but in the future of a small, independent theater.  We, the management team of Hollywood Hits, are committed to this theater for the long term, and hopefully, with your help, we will be here for many years to come.

<p>We were  recently selected from an audition to represent the United Kingdom at the World Championship of Performing Arts (WCOPA) in Hollywood, California in 2015. WCOPA is an Olympics style event for performers from all over the world where participants can compete for medals, scholarships and the chance to work with Hollywood directors and other professionals. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Urban
Warriors would like to represent the UK at the Official WCOPA event in Los
Angeles because it would be lovely to represent the UK in a very under rated
sport, which although incredibly difficult to do and requiring dedication with
training does not have many facilities in which to train at a professional
level.  We are trying to raise awareness
of the performance aspect, as well as the need for dedicated space for Wushu
athletes to train. Indeed we would love to see Wushu recognized as an Olympic sport
in the future along with Olympic quality training facilities.</p>
<p>Performance Wushu
is very exciting to watch although it does not have much coverage outside of
China.  We are hoping to change that
through entering and performing at competitions and events worldwide. </p>
<p>And finally as a
team we love to perform for audiences, and want to inspire more children and
youth , to stay off of the streets and leap into the exiting world of Kung
Fu,  it really can change your life….</p>
<p>With your help we will be able to attend the event and represent the UK in the Variety category. We will have the chance to earn a scholarship at some of the most prestigious acting schools in America as well as have the chance to work with and possibly be represented by people in Hollywood. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are creating a campaign in search of funding to allow us to compete at the WCOPA event. We hope to raise £3000 over the next 60 days to help cover:</p>
<p>-Entry fees</p>

<p>-Registration</p>
<p>-Accomodation</p>
<p>If you are a corporate sponsor making a donation you will be listed as a sponsor in the Contestant Directory book published by the WCOPA in America.

<p><b>What is the Common
Room: Heroes vs. Villains?:</b></p>
<p><a href=""rhapsodycollective.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rhapsody Collective</a>, now in its third cycle, is challenging
our artists in a way we’ve never explored before! As we do each cycle, we give
our teams a theme to create upon. This cycle, we’ve not only given them a
theme, we’ve added a subtheme! In cycle 3, we’re exploring The Common Room:
Heroes vs. Villains! We will be presenting six brand new plays that all take
place on the same set that also capture the essence of the age-old battle,
heroes vs. villains! </p>
<p>One of the great challenges is how we can present six
potentially very different stylistic plays that all use the same exact room.
The COMMON ROOM that has been chosen as our location is the common room of a
college dorm. The personalities and situations that occur in this very public
yet private place is an amazing location to explore the heroes vs. villains
idea. Who are these heroes and villains that inhabit this college?</p>
<p><b>Why we need YOUR
help:</b></p>
<p>In order to bring these six plays to life, we need your
help. This April, we will present our six teams’ plays in true workshop style
at Alchemical Theatre Laboratory! Our goal is to charge a suggested donation as
admission so you have the opportunity to see all six presentations and not feel
as if you need to pick and choose.</p>
<p>This cycle, since we have a more “realistic” theme, we need
to create the space for these plays to live in. Part of our budget will be
devoted to create an iconic common room. We hope we can fill our space with items
including a couch, a coffee table, end tables, a study table, chairs, lamps,
and a community board that each team will be contributing an item to.</p>
<p><b>Where the funds are
going:</b></p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is $5500 and here is how it will
breakdown:</p>
<p>Rent our space at Alchemical Theatre Laboratory for tech and
performances - $2500</p>
<p>Rent rehearsal spaces for all six teams - $1200</p>
<p>Scenic Elements - $1000</p>
<p>Print Programs and Promotional Materials - $200</p>
<p>Other Production Needs- $600</p>
<p><b>What is Rhapsody
Collective?:</b></p>
<p><b>Rhapsody Collective</b>
is a group of young theater artists dedicated to creating new works from the
ground up. Rhapsody Collective strives to foster new and innovative ideas in a
safe environment of peers. The goal is to create, not produce. Over the course
of a cycle, the ensemble of actors, directors, playwrights, and dramaturgs are
randomly broken up into teams to create a brand new piece. The challenge for
each team is “freedom within restrictions.” Each cycle has a theme each piece
must incorporate. Additionally, the roles created must be written specifically
for the actors on their team. At the end of the cycle, each play will be
presented in one harmonious rhapsody. </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal (which would be awesome!), those funds
will go to future Rhapsody Collective projects including an abridged Summer
cycle, Playground Reads, and the start of Cycle 4 in the fall of 2015! </p>

<p></p></div>","What is the Common
Room: Heroes vs. Villains?:
Rhapsody Collective, now in its third cycle, is challenging
our artists in a way we’ve never explored before! As we do each cycle, we give
our teams a theme to create upon. This cycle, we’ve not only given them a
theme, we’ve added a subtheme! In cycle 3, we’re exploring The Common Room:
Heroes vs. Villains! We will be presenting six brand new plays that all take
place on the same set that also capture the essence of the age-old battle,
heroes vs. villains! 
One of the great challenges is how we can present six
potentially very different stylistic plays that all use the same exact room.
The COMMON ROOM that has been chosen as our location is the common room of a
college dorm. The personalities and situations that occur in this very public
yet private place is an amazing location to explore the heroes vs. villains
idea. Who are these heroes and villains that inhabit this college?
Why we need YOUR
help:
In order to bring these six plays to life, we need your
help. This April, we will present our six teams’ plays in true workshop style
at Alchemical Theatre Laboratory! Our goal is to charge a suggested donation as
admission so you have the opportunity to see all six presentations and not feel
as if you need to pick and choose.
This cycle, since we have a more “realistic” theme, we need
to create the space for these plays to live in. Part of our budget will be
devoted to create an iconic common room. We hope we can fill our space with items
including a couch, a coffee table, end tables, a study table, chairs, lamps,
and a community board that each team will be contributing an item to.
Where the funds are
going:
Our ultimate goal is $5500 and here is how it will
breakdown:
Rent our space at Alchemical Theatre Laboratory for tech and
performances - $2500
Rent rehearsal spaces for all six teams - $1200
Scenic Elements - $1000
Print Programs and Promotional Materials - $200
Other Production Needs- $600
What is Rhapsody
Collective?:
Rhapsody Collective
is a group of young theater artists dedicated to creating new works from the
ground up. Rhapsody Collective strives to foster new and innovative ideas in a
safe environment of peers. The goal is to create, not produce. Over the course
of a cycle, the ensemble of actors, directors, playwrights, and dramaturgs are
randomly broken up into teams to create a brand new piece. The challenge for
each team is “freedom within restrictions.” Each cycle has a theme each piece
must incorporate. Additionally, the roles created must be written specifically
for the actors on their team. At the end of the cycle, each play will be
presented in one harmonious rhapsody. 
If we exceed our goal (which would be awesome!), those funds
will go to future Rhapsody Collective projects including an abridged Summer
cycle, Playground Reads, and the start of Cycle 4 in the fall of 2015!

     merges the magic of old-world pre-industrial performance traditions
     with a very modern aesthetic, inquiry, and multi-disciplinary approach. All
     of our performances are explorations of the cycles of love &amp; loss
     that make us human. They are shaped by the specific place (site)
     in which they are created, (in this case <b>an industrial elevator on
     3 floors of a building</b>,) and devised using the unique talents and
     life-stories of each production’s ensemble members, to create an
     experience that is as personal as it is universal, and sacred as it is
     profane.  Our goal is to remember for ourselves, and then tempt you into <i>a world of beauty &amp; uncertainty</i>  where we remember what it means to be truly alive &amp; fully human.</li>

<p>• RA is the Only company in the Berkshires dedicated to <b>site-specific
devised collaborative work.</b></p>
<p>• RA is spearheading a new genre called ""Ritual Theatre"".</p>
<p>• RA is one of 4 theatre companies in the Berkshires created and run by
a woman under the age of 35, and <i>the
only theatre company run by a woman of color.</i></p>
<p>• RA targets a diverse age-range of audiences ages 20- 60, with a focus
on those age 20-40 who are particularly estranged from live theatre.</p>

people. To date we have worked with 100+ local people, age 3 to 89, mostly
non-professionals.</p>

prices affordable- between $15-25 per performance, and we never turn
anyone away for lack of funds.</p>

Desire. Escalation




Hi I'm Pooja Prema, director of Rogue     Angel Theatre and our 4th season's production ""The Lift""-a full-length multi-media
     ritual/dance play that takes place in an elevator with an intimate
     audience of 20 at a time.  It features an ensemble of 6 local
     professional actors, an upright bassist, a saw player, and a piano,
     as well a music score from Brooklyn-based band ‘Half Waif’,  original film montages, and a little bit of burlesque & drag thrown
     in for good measure!  We'll have 2 shows per night from June 18-21
      &  25-28, at 6 & 9pm (for a total audience of
     around 320 over 8 nights) .  The Lift is a dance-play exploring the
     nuances of relationship among human beings, ultimately embracing our
     universal and complex- and sometimes embarrassing- attempts to love
     and be loved.  To see more go to rogueangeltheatre.com/thelift







 Who We Are

 We are a shape-shifting company of actors, dancers & musicians              (usually all 3 in one).  We're committed to creating multi-sensory theatrical experiences that cross the fourth wall and invite the possibility of personal and collective transformation on all levels.  Our last 3 seasons have added liminality, color, youthfulness, and cutting-edge craft to the Berkshires’ theatre scene, involving over 100 local people, and an overall estimated audience of 800.


The Lift ensemble: Meg Agnew, Aaron Brandes, Maziy Broderick Scarpa, Jenny Cavanaugh, Mark Kelso, & Julius Reese
Musicians: Maya Mortman (bass) & Meghan Orbek (saw), and Ananda Plunkett (keyboard) & Zubin Hensler (trumpet)
The Lift Production Crew: Pooja Prema (director),  Hector Riviera (stage manager), Jaramy Moran (lighting), Elizabeth Orenstein (PR)
Artists: Sergio Rico (film), Lisa Vollmer (photography), Michael Vincent Bushy (printmaker) 


New Ritual Theatre


Rogue Angel’s work is a “new” genre we call Ritual Theatre that
     merges the magic of old-world pre-industrial performance traditions
     with a very modern aesthetic, inquiry, and multi-disciplinary approach. All
     of our performances are explorations of the cycles of love & loss
     that make us human. They are shaped by the specific place (site)
     in which they are created, (in this case an industrial elevator on
     3 floors of a building,) and devised using the unique talents and
     life-stories of each production’s ensemble members, to create an
     experience that is as personal as it is universal, and sacred as it is
     profane.  Our goal is to remember for ourselves, and then tempt you into a world of beauty & uncertainty  where we remember what it means to be truly alive & fully human.


We love doing what we do!  And we need your fuel to make it happen.  Invest in the NEW culture of local live arts by Supporting us in creating one of
     the most daring, outrageous & powerful theatrical experiences, right
     here in the Berkshires. 









   What We Need & What You Get
Your support goes a long way to helping us pull off this feat!-logistically and theatrically.  All donations are tax-deductable . We need $15,000 to make ""The Lift"" happen.  This money goes to 4 main areas: 1) Production expenses (production staff stipends, indiegogo expenses campaign & fundraising expenses, insurance and other materials costs including props.)  2) Stipends for the Cast & Crew so everyone gets paid something for all their time, energy and driving. 3) Publicity- printing.  4) Documentation- filming andphotographing the show itself.
 Our PERKS are pretty amazing.  For the first time ever we have Rogue Angel T-shirts.  They have distressed vintage angel wings on the back that will make you look tough, sassy & classy.  Designed by Moho Designs & silk-screened by hand by us here in the Berkshires.  Additional perks include gorgeous postcards of ""The Lift"" photos by Lisa Vollmer, tickets to the show of course starting at $100, tickets to the not-to-be-missed-if-you-live-100-miles-of-here ""Rogue Angel Gala: A Naughty Kind of Heaven"" on May 1st or ""All About Love"": our closing party- on May 17th at the $250 level. From $500 and up, you get to be up close & personal with me & the company in various ways, and from $1000 and up you get to Pick Your Own Adventure!    



Why Support Rogue Angel Theatre?


RA broadens the scope of what
     theatre & dance means in the Berkshires, adding youthfulness,
     color, cutting-edge craft and vibrancy to the performing art scene.



• RA is the Only company in the Berkshires dedicated to site-specific
devised collaborative work.
• RA is spearheading a new genre called ""Ritual Theatre"".
• RA is one of 4 theatre companies in the Berkshires created and run by
a woman under the age of 35, and the
only theatre company run by a woman of color.
• RA targets a diverse age-range of audiences ages 20- 60, with a focus
on those age 20-40 who are particularly estranged from live theatre.
• RA works at a grassroots level, cultivating latent talent in local
people. To date we have worked with 100+ local people, age 3 to 89, mostly
non-professionals.
• RA strives to keep ticket
prices affordable- between $15-25 per performance, and we never turn
anyone away for lack of funds.
You've helped make our
last 3 seasons a success- help us continue our awesome track record.  Isis-Chernobyl
in 2012 and the groundbreaking Rites of Passage in 2013 were both crowdfunded.  Can
we do this in 2015 again?  Yes! 



Taking the Risk
The Lift is an experiment in theatre, in dance, and its a convergence of ideas, desires and wild inspirations.  There is no guarantee that you will like it.  But of course we hope you'll love it.  By supporting us, you are taking a risk, as we are.  Our risk is that we don't know what exactly this will end up being.  We begin with live materials, not a script or pre-ordained structure.  We put our whole souls into this!  Plus, a lot of time, a lot of LOVE, and ultimately we put faith in the creative process and in the competency of our craft.  In supporting us, you're saying ""I want to help these people make some Fresh RISKY art.""   The Lift will mean a lot to us, and our hope is that it will also speak to you-  to your depths, your desires, fantasies, past & future.  But chances are you are sure to be welcomed, moved, and challenged.  So come join the adventure with us!

What starts off as a pleasant afternoon of teasing between Henri and Beth (best friends forever) on a very hot summer day in Charlotte, North Carolina turns into a modern Southern gothic tale of two secrets too many.  They discover that what draws them together may ultimately tear them apart.

<div>Tori Mittelman, founder, and Madison Auch, founding member of In Cahoots Theatre Company, met in 2006 while both living in Fairfax, Virginia during high school. Fast friends and like-minded artists, they started working together early on to create provocative pieces of theatre; in 2010 they put up a production of Don Nigro's <i>Seascape with Sharks and Dancer</i>, in which Tori directed and Madison played Tracy. While attending school in Wisconsin, Tori created a devised project, <i>Traveling to a Strange Place</i>, that focused on feminist issues with classmate Mona Maclay. It was during this endeavor that the term In Cahoots was coined, after a professor of Maclay's and Mittelman's used the term to describe the pair's friendship and unconventional method of collaboration. After Tori moved to Philadelphia in the fall of 2014, In Cahoots Theatre was created, and is thrilled to be producing their first show in the Philadelphia Fringe next fall. </div>

<p><b>Tori Mittelman</b> was born in Pensacola, Florida and from there, moved all over the world as a Navy Brat.  She began writing and directing plays at a young age, with her first real showcase writing the moving ten-minute play about Moses- starring her as Moses.

She is currently working as a literary intern at the Wilma Theatre in Philadelphia. </p>
<p><b>Madison Auch </b>graduated from<b> </b>The University of the Arts in 2014 with a degree in Musical Theatre.  She is an adventurous and compassionate individual who brings

through her work, and she attacks each project with commitment and
professionalism, maintaining the belief that the most productive environment is
one in which the desire for knowledge fuels a sense of curiosity and
questioning, while also allowing for a playful exploration of the material.
Madison strives to encourage audiences to maintain a sense of flirtatious curiosity,
questioning the world they live in and never settling for the easy answer.</p>

<b><br/></b><b>WHAT IS THIS STORY ABOUT?<br/><br/></b><i>""[The Glass] Menagerie
 reveals the story of family members whose lives form a triangle of 
quiet desperation, each struggling with an individual version of hell 
while simultaneously seeking escape from the gravity of each other's 
pathologies.""   <i>—</i>  </i>Robert Bray<br/> <br/><b>And in this quiet triangle of desperation, lives a story about three people who love each other. <b><b>Tennessee Williams writes about the universal. <br/>We are raising money to shed light on something you thought you knew - home. </b></b></b><i>""How beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken""</i>  <i>—</i> The Glass Menagerie.<b><br/><br/>This is a Canadian Production of
Tennessee William’s classic. It explores the plight of the single mother raising two adult children on her own. Williams offers to the audience, something we can examine and digest
through tears and laughter. <br/><br/>
</b><p><b>Why is this play relevant today?</b></p>
<p><b></b>Today,
the electronic world is changing into the digital world. There is revolution
and evolution going on as a result, and the whole nuclear family concept is in
great flux. Individualism versus collectivism is an ongoing debate and a
paramount theme in the breakdown of the family unit.<span>  </span></p>
<p>It
is significant to take something like THE GLASS MENAGERIE, and mount it at this
particular time because it is a great metaphor for change and reflective of all
things topical. It looks both backward and forward in time, outward and inward.
It depicts heroes and victims that we can all relate to. As John Lahr states,
“it also broadcasts William’s dramatic goal – to redeem life, through beauty,
from the humiliation of grief.”</p>

society is changing. Chekhov and the revolution. Shakespeare and the 
Renaissance. Homer, Euripides and Aristophanes in Greece and the city 
states. Williams and the end of the antibellum period and WWI. The 
beginning of post-war future. <b>We are in this similar kind of transition 
now. The world is changing hugely.</b> The ""Dinosaurs"" are like Amanda 
holding desperately on to the past and with that holding on some people 
will be sacrificed. Like Laura is. Like Syrians and natives in Africa.

<b><br/>THEATRE IS ELECTRIFYING. <br/></b>This is something to strive for, isn't it?  <p></p>
<b><br/>WHY THEATRE?<br/></b>
<p>
<i>In an age where most communication is through some media filter 
like the Internet, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Television and Film, there
 is something spiritual in people sitting and focused in a direction and
 exploring the human experience in a human manner whether it's through humor or drama. The energy of the live experience transcends anything 
mechanical. We need to keep our ears as alert and active as our eyes. 
And our brains and senses as sharp as we possibly can. The live 
experience is the source <i>—</i> </i>Director Mel Tuck</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<b><br/>WHY ARE WE RAISING MONEY?<br/></b><b>We started small</b> as an 
independent company, in an effort to create a unified approach to the 
work, selecting evocative material well-suited to the company and written by the greats.

do this is to honor what we call “The Williams’ Aesthetic”. The major challenge in this approach
is to create with utmost specificity, the world in which Williams writes about.
Specificity in story-telling is universally effective. To meet the demands of
this challenge, we have started our process long in advance and this has
included dramaturgical studies of the play/playwright. Williams’ family life
occupies a huge presence in this play and there is great information at our

</div></div>","""Enthusiasm is the most important thing in life.""  — Tennessee Williams
                              A timeless masterpiece.  An innovative collaboration. 


                               ISLAND PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS:


                

                    You can leave a broken home, but can you ever really escape it? 
WHAT IS THIS STORY ABOUT?""[The Glass] Menagerie
 reveals the story of family members whose lives form a triangle of 
quiet desperation, each struggling with an individual version of hell 
while simultaneously seeking escape from the gravity of each other's 
pathologies.""   —  Robert Bray And in this quiet triangle of desperation, lives a story about three people who love each other. Tennessee Williams writes about the universal. We are raising money to shed light on something you thought you knew - home. ""How beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken""  — The Glass Menagerie.This is a Canadian Production of
Tennessee William’s classic. It explores the plight of the single mother raising two adult children on her own. Williams offers to the audience, something we can examine and digest
through tears and laughter. 
Why is this play relevant today?
Today,
the electronic world is changing into the digital world. There is revolution
and evolution going on as a result, and the whole nuclear family concept is in
great flux. Individualism versus collectivism is an ongoing debate and a
paramount theme in the breakdown of the family unit.  
It
is significant to take something like THE GLASS MENAGERIE, and mount it at this
particular time because it is a great metaphor for change and reflective of all
things topical. It looks both backward and forward in time, outward and inward.
It depicts heroes and victims that we can all relate to. As John Lahr states,
“it also broadcasts William’s dramatic goal – to redeem life, through beauty,
from the humiliation of grief.”
WHO'S INVOLVED?Directed by Mel TuckAssociate Director Sean Sullivan Set and Costume Design by Diana Capstick-DaleSound Design by David CieriSet Construction by David McLeodCast in order of appearance: Andrew Coghlan as TomLynne Griffin as AmandaGina Leon as LauraMichael Germant as The Gentleman CallerSEPTEMBER 7- 25 @ PAL STUDIO THEATREPREVIEW SHOW September 6th.581 Cardero Street, Vancouver.TICKETS available HERE!
WHY TELL THIS STORY TODAY?From director Mel Tuck: The greatest playwrights come forward when 
society is changing. Chekhov and the revolution. Shakespeare and the 
Renaissance. Homer, Euripides and Aristophanes in Greece and the city 
states. Williams and the end of the antibellum period and WWI. The 
beginning of post-war future. We are in this similar kind of transition 
now. The world is changing hugely. The ""Dinosaurs"" are like Amanda 
holding desperately on to the past and with that holding on some people 
will be sacrificed. Like Laura is. Like Syrians and natives in Africa. 
Amanda is a terrifying person, but she's funny. So are dinosaurs.                                               Karen Austin (as Laura) and Director Mel Tuck (as Tom) - 1968And so...When a writer tells a story that has to be told...
                      

                                     When a director lifts the vision off the page and creates a world in which we are transported to...                                     
                                                                Director Mel Tuck
      

When an actor artfully and truthful inhabits a character, humanizing the written experience...

     


When the atmosphere of a play is enhanced by the subtle dynamics of light and sound...
Here he is by the way, our composer extraordinaire... DAVID CIERI
     
When the set illuminates social and economic, private and public, personal 
and political tensions of a world written by TENNESSEE WILLIAMS...

                                            
                           Stage and Costume Designer (Diana Capstick- Dale)  

THEATRE IS ELECTRIFYING. This is something to strive for, isn't it?  
WHY THEATRE?

In an age where most communication is through some media filter 
like the Internet, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Television and Film, there
 is something spiritual in people sitting and focused in a direction and
 exploring the human experience in a human manner whether it's through humor or drama. The energy of the live experience transcends anything 
mechanical. We need to keep our ears as alert and active as our eyes. 
And our brains and senses as sharp as we possibly can. The live 
experience is the source — Director Mel Tuck

WHY ARE WE RAISING MONEY?We started small as an 
independent company, in an effort to create a unified approach to the 
work, selecting evocative material well-suited to the company and written by the greats.

<h3>The name on everybody's lips is gonna be Adolf.</h3>
<p>Here she is, boys!<br/>Here she is, world-ish!<br/>Here’s ADOLF!</p>
<p>Start spreading the good word, ‘cause <i>Mein Comps</i> is gearing up for world domination... err... tour. A ridiculous 2018/2019 world-ish tour! Where it’ll stop, nobody knows! Just kidding. The full show’s coming back to Chicago, plus first-time engagements in New York, Pittsburgh, London (!!!), and more. Dates, theatres (and that’s theatre with an -re), and casting coming soon.</p>
<p>There will also be a one-man edition of the show traipsing around the 2018 U.S. fringe festival circuit. Applications have been sent in to Minneapolis, Providence, San Diego, and San Francisco. Announcements will be made as lotteries are performed.</p>
<p><i>Mein Comps</i>, written by and starring the shrewd, undomesticated, and Chicago-based Tyler Anthony Smith, is a gaaaaay fantasia on irrational international themes, in a which a certain dictator sells discounted theatre tickets. Mhmm.</p>
<p>It's just another typical day for Adolf Moira Angela Hitler. Hungover. Sore. Constantly on the phone, dealing with fools who want orchestra seats to Cats at bargain prices. But wires are crossed when a mysterious customer from a month ago wedges his way into our fabulous trainwreck of a leading man's heart. Will Mademoiselle Hitler end his streak of sleeping around and settle down? Will he sober up in time to remember that today's the day he has an audition for the role of Amanda in yet another revival of The Glass Menagerie? Are you more confused now than when you started reading this semi-synopsis?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Money, money, money...</h3>
<p>It must be funny in a rich man's world, huh? Well, in order to make Adolf Moira's funny world-ish tour go off without hitch, she needs some dough. It's a real biotch playing the Beggar Woman, but in order to get your art out of the womb, you gotta push. Push it real good.</p>
<p>The goal is to raise $3,000. That's chump change for folks who use the phrase ""chump change."" This will cover the costs of theatre rentals and travel.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes. Of course you get something if you donate, you grubby minxes.</p>

</div></div>","The name on everybody's lips is gonna be Adolf.
Here she is, boys!Here she is, world-ish!Here’s ADOLF!
Start spreading the good word, ‘cause Mein Comps is gearing up for world domination... err... tour. A ridiculous 2018/2019 world-ish tour! Where it’ll stop, nobody knows! Just kidding. The full show’s coming back to Chicago, plus first-time engagements in New York, Pittsburgh, London (!!!), and more. Dates, theatres (and that’s theatre with an -re), and casting coming soon.
There will also be a one-man edition of the show traipsing around the 2018 U.S. fringe festival circuit. Applications have been sent in to Minneapolis, Providence, San Diego, and San Francisco. Announcements will be made as lotteries are performed.
Mein Comps, written by and starring the shrewd, undomesticated, and Chicago-based Tyler Anthony Smith, is a gaaaaay fantasia on irrational international themes, in a which a certain dictator sells discounted theatre tickets. Mhmm.
It's just another typical day for Adolf Moira Angela Hitler. Hungover. Sore. Constantly on the phone, dealing with fools who want orchestra seats to Cats at bargain prices. But wires are crossed when a mysterious customer from a month ago wedges his way into our fabulous trainwreck of a leading man's heart. Will Mademoiselle Hitler end his streak of sleeping around and settle down? Will he sober up in time to remember that today's the day he has an audition for the role of Amanda in yet another revival of The Glass Menagerie? Are you more confused now than when you started reading this semi-synopsis?

Money, money, money...
It must be funny in a rich man's world, huh? Well, in order to make Adolf Moira's funny world-ish tour go off without hitch, she needs some dough. It's a real biotch playing the Beggar Woman, but in order to get your art out of the womb, you gotta push. Push it real good.
The goal is to raise $3,000. That's chump change for folks who use the phrase ""chump change."" This will cover the costs of theatre rentals and travel.
Yes, yes, yes. Of course you get something if you donate, you grubby minxes.

<p>Adina had just finished singing a famous aria that is sung by the character of Laetitia from The Old Maid and the Thief: ""Steal me, sweet thief""</p>
<p>She sat down next to Rachel on the stairs.</p>
<p>""I love that opera!  I sang the role of Miss Todd in college,"" said Rachel.</p>
<p>""I've never sung the whole role of Laetitia,"" replied Adina.</p>
<p>In a flash of inspiration, these two Bay Area singers locked eyes and a simultaneous thought burst out of their mouths ""We should do that opera together!""</p>
<p>You see, the life of a singer in any community is very often dictated by variables outside of their control.  And, at that moment, Rachel and Adina decided to take control and bring ""The Old Maid and the Thief"" alive through their own grit, legwork, stamina, and of course, talent.</p>
<p>So they decided to start their own company, The Opera Lounge. </p>
<p>Why call ourselves “The Opera Lounge”? Well, both Adina and Rachel recognize that the opera art form is due for a revolution.  Non-opera fans have an impression about opera, that it is stuffy, expensive, un-relatable, and an art form for the elite.</p>
<p>The Opera Lounge is dedicated to mounting performances in comfortable, non-traditional venues where an audience, be they opera novices or established fans, can witness a professional level opera experience in a very casual setting.</p>
<p>Dedicated to the talent rich musical community of the SF Bay Area, The Opera Lounge looks to provide opportunities for professional performers.  Musicians know that the SF Bay Area always needs a new opera company to serve their community.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

#nofilter is a cross artform production largely focused on mental illness and includes topics such as suicide,  self harm, bulimia, dissociative identity disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, addiction and abuse. #nofilter had it's World premiere at the 2016 Adelaide Fringe Festival which was an acclaimed a sold out success. 
Never in our wildest dreams could we have ever imagined the impact this show would have on its audience nor how important it's message would be. We knew what it meant to us as a cast as the entire production was based on true events and the struggles we face and continue to fight on a day to day basis. (Im so proud of the cast for sharing this and baring themselves)  
We are amazingly fortunate to have been invited to showcase #nofilter in the Festival d'Avignon this July, in Avignon; France. Our home will become the Garage International based at the Hotel Mecure Pont d'Avignon. The festival is the largest contemporary arts festival in the world and is in its 70th year. However we need to start fundraising in order to get the cast there. We need your help to take the first step towards touring this show around the world and continuing to show how important supporting mental health awareness is. 
Together we can achieve this goal. 
#followyourdreams
 
 What We Need 

Passports,Flights,Accommodation...... OH MY !
Flights... We have a cast and crew of 13. We need approximately $24,700.00 to get everybody there.
Accommodation for our 15 show season, which doubles as storage for our sets and props. $3000

If we don't reach our desired goal (which we will, by launching only positive rockets) we will put the money towards our original goal of touring the production through regional South Australia, Australia and future international touring. 
Velvet Chase Productions has already pitched the idea to the South Australian Government Minister for the Arts and Mental Health, with a view to make #nofilter age appropriate for Australian schools; which was received with great anticipation.

Already in our short run at the 2016 Adelaide Fringe we appear to have had an impact on many of those who shared the experience of #nofilter.

""Tonight's performance of No Filter was no less than a five stars with heart wrenching scenes that left me in tears, what a cast, what a show and amazing music score ""#nofilter sadly you have missed it at this years ADELAIDE FRINGE""

Risks & Challenges
With taking our show to France we face a few risks and challenges. However we also have solutions for your risks to minimise them and to fix the challenges.  
Language Barriers - No one in the cast speaks French and we need to promote the show.
Cutting a 90min show down to 50mins and adjusting it to suit the cast that are going.
Finding accommodation for 13 people and props (can't store props at the theatre) 
10min bump in and set up time (we are used to a generous 5 hour bump in)
 ""Je M'appelle Dannielle ""  This very day, Saturday the 26th of March, some of the cast and crew met up with one of the local French groups that meet every week for brunch. This will be our new family for the next few months, anyone who speaks French is welcome to join the group on Saturdays from 9.30am onwards @MyFriendLouis. #nofilter has no dialogue and is performed to a beautiful music score which in turn makes it universal and able to break through those language barriers. 
The beauty of #nofilter is that it contains all these beautiful little stories that can be told alone or together - the show has been designed to be able to perform it from a 15min show to a 90min full scale production. 
As there is such a large group of us we would be looking at sharing a villa about a 30min train ride out of Avignon But with Storage and no preparation room at the venue this was seeming to be a hurdle we couldn't jump until one of our amazing tec guys suggested we hire a small room in the hotel that is home to Garage International ( this will become our props and change room area )  
As for 10min bump in, we have cleverly come up with an idea of setting up the stage as part of our first routine allowing us more time for bump in.

<p>Hola,</p>
<p></p>
<p> soy Iván, tengo 18 años, y como ha de ser a esta edad, estoy lleno de ilusión por conseguir las tantas expectativas que uno se plantea alcanzar para cuando empieza a trazar lo que será su vida. Casi inesperadamente, me he encontrado con una gran oportunidad que permite que esta ilusión siga creciendo.  Se trata de la gran suerte que he tenido de ser seleccionado para estudiar en P.A.R.T.S, considerada internacionalmente una de las mejores escuelas de danza contemporánea.</p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Hello,<br/></i></p>
<p><i>
my name is Iván, I am eighteen years old, and, like it has to be at my age, I
am excited to make true all the wishes I´ve had when I was wondering what would
I do in my life. And now I have the great opportunity to study at P.A.R.T.S. to
make them true.</i><i><br/></i></p>

<h4>Sobre mí / <i>about me</i>
</h4>Llevo varios años estudiando en el Conservatorio Profesional de Danza del <i>Institut del Teatre</i>, y aunque disfruto con muchas otras cosas, el baile es a lo que le he dedicado más tiempo estos últimos años. No diré que quería ser bailarín desde pequeño, pero siempre me gustó bailar, así como cantar y tocar cazuelas con un par de baquetas, hacer el payaso, dibujar, hacer películas... </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Las artes siempre me han gustado, pero también el deporte, cosa que puede haber condicionado que me haya decantado por la danza. Sin embargo no es todo lo que quiero hacer ni lo único que hago. De hecho llevo más tiempo estudiando la batería, y aunque sea por mi cuenta, no voy a dejar de hacerlo. Soy alguien con muchas pasiones y mi intención es vivir con todas ellas, hacer que se nutran entre sí, combinarlas, fusionarlas y hacerlas aparecer en escena; y por esta razón P.A.R.T.S. es uno de los mejores lugares a los que podría ir, no solo por el nivel técnico en cuanto a la danza, sino por la formación completa que ofrece, en la que se trabaja también el teatro y la música para formar a intérpretes que realmente dominen el arte de la escena.</p>

<p><i>I´ve
been several years studying at the Conservatory of Dance of </i>Institut del
Teatre<i>, and although I enjoy doing many other things, the last years I've spent
most of the time dancing. I will not say I wanted to be a dancer since
childhood, but I always liked to dance, sing and play pots with a pair of
drumsticks, clowning, drawing, making movies...</i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>The
arts have always liked me, but also sport, which could had conditioned me to
opt for dance. However, it is not all I want to do and the only thing I do. I
am someone with many passions and I intend to live with them all, make nurture
each other, combine them and fusion them on stage; and for this reason
P.A.R.T.S. is one of the best places I could go, not only for the technical
level in terms of dance, but for the complete training offered, in which
theater and music take place to develop performers who really dominate art
scene.</i></span></p>

(<i>Performing Arts Research and Training Studios</i>) es una escuela de danza contemporánea fundada por Anna Teresa <span>De Keersmaeker </span>que proporciona una formación técnica y completa para que bailarines y coreógrafos puedan convertirse en <b>artistas</b> independientes y creativos.</span></p>
<p><span>Se trabaja con más de 50 profesionales de alrededor del mundo en intensivos técnicos o creativos que suelen durar un mes; s<span>e imparten clases de teatro, canto y teoría musical, así como de shiatsu, yoga, pilates, y danza clásica <span>como entrenamiento físico</span>; y hay clases teóricas de anatomía, historia de la danza, sociología y filosofía.</span></span></p>
<p>Para entrar tuve que pasar una preselección realizada en 21 países de todo el mundo que determinó quienes seríamos los 180 que iríamos a Bruselas a hacer la audición final durante una semana entera. Allí eligieron a los 44 alumnos que representaremos a la escuela durante los tres próximos cursos, pues trabajan con un único grupo durante el proceso de la formación; cosa que complica aún más formar parte de la escuela, por su única audición cada tres años, su larga duración y la abundante participación que esto conlleva.<br/></p>

creative <b>artists</b>. </i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>It works with more
than 50 professionals from around the world in technical or creative workshops
usually lasting one month; there are theater, singing and music theory classes,
as well as shiatsu, yoga, pilates, and classical dance as physical training; and
there are theoretical classes including bodie´s anatomy, dance history,
sociology and philosophy.</i></span></p>
<p><i>To enter I had to
pass a pre-selection they did in 21 countries around the world. And then I went
to Brussels with 180 more people to make the one week final audition, which
decided the 44 students who will represent the school for the next three
courses (they work with only one group during all the training cycle, which
further complicates being part of the school, becouse their only audition every
three years, its long duration and the abundant participation that this
entails).</i></p>

</div></div>","Hola,

 soy Iván, tengo 18 años, y como ha de ser a esta edad, estoy lleno de ilusión por conseguir las tantas expectativas que uno se plantea alcanzar para cuando empieza a trazar lo que será su vida. Casi inesperadamente, me he encontrado con una gran oportunidad que permite que esta ilusión siga creciendo.  Se trata de la gran suerte que he tenido de ser seleccionado para estudiar en P.A.R.T.S, considerada internacionalmente una de las mejores escuelas de danza contemporánea.

Hello,

my name is Iván, I am eighteen years old, and, like it has to be at my age, I
am excited to make true all the wishes I´ve had when I was wondering what would
I do in my life. And now I have the great opportunity to study at P.A.R.T.S. to
make them true.



Sobre mí / about me
Llevo varios años estudiando en el Conservatorio Profesional de Danza del Institut del Teatre, y aunque disfruto con muchas otras cosas, el baile es a lo que le he dedicado más tiempo estos últimos años. No diré que quería ser bailarín desde pequeño, pero siempre me gustó bailar, así como cantar y tocar cazuelas con un par de baquetas, hacer el payaso, dibujar, hacer películas... 
Las artes siempre me han gustado, pero también el deporte, cosa que puede haber condicionado que me haya decantado por la danza. Sin embargo no es todo lo que quiero hacer ni lo único que hago. De hecho llevo más tiempo estudiando la batería, y aunque sea por mi cuenta, no voy a dejar de hacerlo. Soy alguien con muchas pasiones y mi intención es vivir con todas ellas, hacer que se nutran entre sí, combinarlas, fusionarlas y hacerlas aparecer en escena; y por esta razón P.A.R.T.S. es uno de los mejores lugares a los que podría ir, no solo por el nivel técnico en cuanto a la danza, sino por la formación completa que ofrece, en la que se trabaja también el teatro y la música para formar a intérpretes que realmente dominen el arte de la escena.


I´ve
been several years studying at the Conservatory of Dance of Institut del
Teatre, and although I enjoy doing many other things, the last years I've spent
most of the time dancing. I will not say I wanted to be a dancer since
childhood, but I always liked to dance, sing and play pots with a pair of
drumsticks, clowning, drawing, making movies...
The
arts have always liked me, but also sport, which could had conditioned me to
opt for dance. However, it is not all I want to do and the only thing I do. I
am someone with many passions and I intend to live with them all, make nurture
each other, combine them and fusion them on stage; and for this reason
P.A.R.T.S. is one of the best places I could go, not only for the technical
level in terms of dance, but for the complete training offered, in which
theater and music take place to develop performers who really dominate art
scene.



Sobre / about  P.A.R.T.S.
P.A.R.T.S. (Performing Arts Research and Training Studios) es una escuela de danza contemporánea fundada por Anna Teresa De Keersmaeker que proporciona una formación técnica y completa para que bailarines y coreógrafos puedan convertirse en artistas independientes y creativos.
Se trabaja con más de 50 profesionales de alrededor del mundo en intensivos técnicos o creativos que suelen durar un mes; se imparten clases de teatro, canto y teoría musical, así como de shiatsu, yoga, pilates, y danza clásica como entrenamiento físico; y hay clases teóricas de anatomía, historia de la danza, sociología y filosofía.
Para entrar tuve que pasar una preselección realizada en 21 países de todo el mundo que determinó quienes seríamos los 180 que iríamos a Bruselas a hacer la audición final durante una semana entera. Allí eligieron a los 44 alumnos que representaremos a la escuela durante los tres próximos cursos, pues trabajan con un único grupo durante el proceso de la formación; cosa que complica aún más formar parte de la escuela, por su única audición cada tres años, su larga duración y la abundante participación que esto conlleva.
Más información en http://www.parts.be/.



P.A.R.T.S.
(Performing Arts Research and Training Studios) is a school of contemporary
dance founded by Anna Teresa De Keersmaeker that provides a technical and
complete training for dancers and choreographers to become independent and
creative artists. 
It works with more
than 50 professionals from around the world in technical or creative workshops
usually lasting one month; there are theater, singing and music theory classes,
as well as shiatsu, yoga, pilates, and classical dance as physical training; and
there are theoretical classes including bodie´s anatomy, dance history,
sociology and philosophy.
To enter I had to
pass a pre-selection they did in 21 countries around the world. And then I went
to Brussels with 180 more people to make the one week final audition, which
decided the 44 students who will represent the school for the next three
courses (they work with only one group during all the training cycle, which
further complicates being part of the school, becouse their only audition every
three years, its long duration and the abundant participation that this
entails).
More information at http://www.parts.be/.


Presupuesto / budget
La escuela no es barata, los tres cursos cuestan unos 13.450€ en total (4.500€ de matrícula +    7.500€ por los tres cursos    +    450€ para las actuaciones    +    1.000€ para proyectos); y vivir allí tampoco (véase el presupuesto estimado del primer curso). 



The
school is not cheap, the three courses cost around 13.450€ (4.500€ registration
fee + 7.500€ tuition fee + 450€ performances + 1.000€ external projects); and
living there neither (look at the first year´s estimated buget). 


Colaboración / collaboration

Realmente con vuestra colaboración estaréis propiciando el éxito en la importante etapa de mi profesionalización. Así que por favor, os pido que me  ayudéis a que se haga realidad esta gran aventura. Ya sea por difundir esto o por colaborar con una donación (que por pequeña que pueda parecer valdrá oro para mí si todos aportáis un poquito) os estaré enormemente agradecido.
Gracias!



With your collaboration you will be contributing the success
of the important stage of my professionalization. So please, I ask you to help
me in this great adventure. Whether spreading this or making a donation (which
althought may seem small it will be gold for me if everyone helps a little) I
will be very grateful to you.
Thank you!

<h3>Dreams of Wrestling...</h3>
<p>My name is Ashley Lauren Rogers and I'm a New York City-based playwright, stand-up comic, and trans rights advocate... But ever since I was 12 I wanted to be a professional wrestler.  I idolized the likes of The 1-2-3 Kid, Chris Jericho, Kane, and later Rob Van Dam... So why didn't I become a wrestler?  Back in the '90s it didn't feel like it was a viable option for work... And also I'm trans, so I didn't know whether I'd be welcomed.  So I focused elsewhere.  I focused on a career that was tangentially related to the ""Sports Entertainment,"" I loved... I turned to theatre.   </p>
<p>I put my dreams of wrestling to the side.  Focused on dramatic storytelling, absurdist comedy, and using art as a form of both self reflection and of resistance.  I've performed and had my work produced in New York City, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Detroit, Cincinnati, Minneappolis and Miami to name a few.  I've been featured as an expert on Revry.TV as well as Fusion TV's Sex.Right.Now... But I've never forgotten that love of wrestling.</p>
<p>It is because of that that I want to create a hybrid of the medium I love and the medium I work with.  I want to create the atmosphere and story-telling of a professional wrestling Pay Per View event but utilizing fight choreography, acro-basing gymnastics, and technology to create a piece of action packed, highly theatrical performance art with a queer bent. </p>

Part immersive performance, part collaboration with the audience, <i>Made of Static </i>situates viewers in the middle of inquiry by stationing them throughout the performance space in places both convenient and strange. Considering notions of “Placemaking,” this work sees the performance landscape as integral, a place for audience and performer to meet. By inhabiting this world, viewers are asked to negotiate personal choice and prescribed direction as they move throughout the work. In this way, place is used as mechanism to shape viewing lens, effect emotional state, and impact viewing response.

In this piece, the depths of fatigue as it parallels the body’s threshold for both cardiovascular and muscular endurance is tested, challenging the stigmas associated with physical fitness and its socially constructed symbiotic relationship with the body’s physique. <i>BIG GIRL PANTIES</i> questions the validity of size determining  “fit”ness, ultimately asking the audience to decide who is worthy of taking the stage.</p><p> </p><h3>BreakingTime (excerpt)</h3><p>By Andy Slavin</p><p><i>In BreakingTime, we do not lose.

PurposeFor most, we understand what we can see. By embedding our research in a physical exploration, we can engage our viewers' in conversations through imagery, effort, shape, and sound, inviting a multi-sensory experience. Each of these works serve a direct line of inquiry. Do our bodies have value? How does language limit others' perceptions of ourselves? How do the spaces we choose to occupy reflect our needs to identify? To prove our right to hold those spaces? To provide us comfort in our belonging? We invite you to join us as we enter these studies of self both in and out of the studio.Putting A Bow On ItThank you. Thank you in advance, and thank you for now. Thank you for your financial backing. Thank you to our community for its mentorship, propulsion, and support. We are so grateful.Share. Engage.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Saya Baker, I am a 20 year old Pilates Instructor, Reiki Practitioner, and artist/dancer based in NYC. I have been dancing for 15  years, and I have recently begun choreographing to perform. </p>
<p>I am building this campaign to grow funds for my new dance piece ""If Her Eyes Could Talk"". The piece is about my life, the trauma I have experienced up until this point, and the subconscious narrative and conversations created because of it. This work is extremely close to my heart, and I get to make my vision come to life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I need to raise at <i>least</i>  $2,000!</p>
<p>What this pays for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space ($200+)</li>
<li>Theater Rental ($1,000)</li>
<li>Musician stipend ($150+)</li>
<li>Dancers stipend ($100+)</li>
<li>Production Manager/Lighting Designer ($225+) </li>
<li>Costumes ($250+)</li>
<li>Accessories ($75 - 100)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the entire goal of $2,000 is <i>not </i>reached, the funds will immediately go to theater rental. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""If Her Eyes Could Talk"" is a piece that speaks to hundreds of thousands of people all over the world. The trauma that we experience as children has a <i>direct </i>effect on the person we grow up to be. Every relationship that we build, the way we communicate, the way we see the world, and the way we see ourselves is shaped by our history. In my case - and I'm sure many others - I grew into only resentment, bitterness, and pain. I felt that the world was against me, and that every relationship I built - intimate or not - would result in the same pain I felt as a child.</p>
<p>And sure enough, it did.  </p>
<p>I manifested my past into my present and continued to experience traumatic event, after traumatic event. It became too much. All I wanted was to feel peace, and joy. It didn't feel possible up until this past August. </p>
<p>I want to share my life, and my vision with people, to show them that they are not alone.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating a piece and performing it in 2 months is difficult process. For example, finding dancers that are available on all rehearsal dates, finding affordable rehearsal space, stage and lighting design could not happen if sufficient funds are not generated, etc. </p>
<p>This piece gets to be shared with the world, and although it may be challenging, I am committed to having it happen no matter what. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to support financially, don't let that stop you from supporting another way!</p>
<p>Spread this campaign around, use the Indiegogo share tools, show up to the performance, <strong>MAKE SOME NOISE!  </strong></p>

In the cake are hidden a dried bean and a dried pea; one audience member will cut the cake into slices and give them to the actors.

Now, we're going to make it happen Off-Broadway. And that ain’t cheap.Our goal is to launch a six-week run of BFF with the hopes of continuing on the heels of a successful debut.This is a monster opportunity for an up-and-coming playwright (one of the youngest in Off-Broadway history!). We hope you’ll join our team and help us get BFF to Off-Broadway.What We NeedWe need to raise $20,000.Where does the moolah go?Straight to making BFF happen. This is a six-week production (at least) which means plenty of expenses:Cast and Crew – We have some seriously talented people working with us. Brilliant actors, visionary designers, superhuman technicians, an incredible director, heck, even our PA’s are impressive.Rehearsal Space – Excellent performances start with tons of rehearsal. So, there’s going to be plenty of it. And that means lots of rehearsal space.Wardrobe – An integral part of the BFF experience, wardrobe can be its own critical storytelling element. Isn’t that right, Mrs. Maisel? Marketing and PR – We’re going to have a fantastic production but we’ve got to spread the word if we’re going to fill theater seats. That means getting reviews, making ads, creating buzz, and reaching as many theater lovers as possible. Luckily, we happen to have a few experienced marketing pros helping us out.Theater Rental – This is where the magic happens, but we still have to pay the rent.And we’ve got perks! Lots of them. Fun, unique, exclusive BFF-related tchatchkes and experiences. Every donation gets you some sweet swag and helps us reach our goal of getting BFF to Off-Broadway.Join us!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On Feb 2-4, 2018 I am producing a unique 1 hour acrobatic dance piece and interactive gallery installation revealing the complexity of international adoption titled <i><strong>Born, Never Asked.</strong></i>  This work is bringing awareness to an underrepresented element of adoption policy through an artistic medium that connects people through the heart, not just their minds.  With your support I can bring healing, empowerment and consciousness to adopted families.</p>

With a Master of Fine Arts in Dance degree from the University of California, Irvine, I research lineage, embodiment, and process to make original contemporary choreographies. With my work, I comment on world consciousness through physical, subtle, and often nuanced embodied patterns of thought. </p><p><strong><u>The Work</u> </strong></p><p>This particular work, began as a personal choreographic journey that searched for a balance between western concert dance practices and my female Mexican-American culture and upbringing. </p><p><i><strong>Agave Americana </strong></i>-- A perceptional journey of ethnic identity taking shape in the American Southwest. Symbolic gestures, swaying hips, and harmonic progressions take audiences through a poetic movement experience that celebrates Mexican-American femininity.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568676039/efc6tngwqdk7emabwfcd.png"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong><u>The Restaging</u></strong></h3><p><strong><i>Agave Americana</i> at Bootleg Theater on October 25th &amp; 26th, 2019</strong></p><p>In this project, the team dives deeper into blending and layering stories. The dance first premiered in Orange County in April of 2019 with performances by UC Irvine undergraduate dance majors. It is currently being restaged and reimagined with professional artists to take on a fresh shape that deepens the context of ethnic narrative, perception, and form in a modern dance performance.</p><p>This dance was first created with intentions of having showings in Los Angeles.

With a Master of Fine Arts in Dance degree from the University of California, Irvine, I research lineage, embodiment, and process to make original contemporary choreographies. With my work, I comment on world consciousness through physical, subtle, and often nuanced embodied patterns of thought. The Work This particular work, began as a personal choreographic journey that searched for a balance between western concert dance practices and my female Mexican-American culture and upbringing. Agave Americana -- A perceptional journey of ethnic identity taking shape in the American Southwest. Symbolic gestures, swaying hips, and harmonic progressions take audiences through a poetic movement experience that celebrates Mexican-American femininity.The RestagingAgave Americana at Bootleg Theater on October 25th & 26th, 2019In this project, the team dives deeper into blending and layering stories. The dance first premiered in Orange County in April of 2019 with performances by UC Irvine undergraduate dance majors. It is currently being restaged and reimagined with professional artists to take on a fresh shape that deepens the context of ethnic narrative, perception, and form in a modern dance performance.This dance was first created with intentions of having showings in Los Angeles.

<p>Seven Starving Artists is a collaborative company focused on social change and social issues. We are committed to creating poetic, thought-provoking work that gives voice to underrepresented people and topics. We hope to create experiences that resonate with modern audiences.</p>
<p>Seven Starving Artists was formed at the University of Lethbridge by a group of senior students looking to create a place for themselves in the ever-growing landscape of Canadian theatre.<br/>The founding members of Seven Starving Artists chose to work together due to a shared desire to create and produce new and exciting work that challenges social norms and pushes the boundaries of the art form.</p>
<p>Donations to this project will help us put on the world premiere of a new Canadian work written by a fellow Albertan. The money raised will pay for the rental of rehearsal spaces, the production of a set, items needed for lighting and costume design, paying the artists involved and so much more! Any money raised above and beyond what is required for this project will go towards the companies insurance and future productions to keep us running in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding Breakdown</h3>
<p>Where will your money go?</p>
<p><strong>Production: ~$250-$300</strong></p>
<p>Scenic Design:<strong> </strong>$100 - We expect that this show will require a budget of approximately $100 for the Scenic Design elements of this production. For purchasing furniture and building materials to build an amazing set that will bring the audience into the world of the play. </p>
<p>Costume Design: $50 - This will cover any items needed to costume the actor's that we cannot borrow from actors and crew.</p>
<p>Lighting Design: $50 - Our production will take place in a garage and the lighting budget will cover the practical lights needed to properly light the space.</p>
<p>Prop Design: $50 - This show requires many props and the $50 budget will cover any props that cannot be borrowed from the cast and crew.</p>
<p>*These numbers are all approximated and we may end up needing to expand budgets.*</p>
<p><b>Production Team and Actors: ~$1000 (Seven Starving Artists Founders will not be paid)</b></p>
<p>We estimate that paying the production team and the actors (approximately 15 artists) for their work will require around $1000 to pay everyone. Any money raised above and beyond will allow us to pay the team more than a minimum honorarium.</p>
<p>*If we do not make enough money to cover our costs we will have to dive into personal pockets and hope that we will make it back from ticket sales, so we very much appreciate any and all donations made.*</p>
<p>Feel free to email us at 7starvingartists@gmail.com if you have any questions about donations.</p>

New and upcoming artists are coming to Calgary to start their careers and knowing that we have the support of the citizens of Calgary will encourage students and young artists to continue migrating to Calgary and creating new and important art for the community. </p>
<p>Thanks to Calgarians and their donations to our company, this will be our fourth show produced in Calgary. Seven Starving Artists has even managed to participate in festivals and win awards thanks to donations from people like you.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s African-Americans began to migrate north in large numbers. Harlem was where their community was, so many moved there, despite the high rents.

We’re transported in time to an era poignant and pivotal to the African-American experience in this country and people of all ages should know these stories, hear these words and listen to this music. Come follow Rose, Jenny and Ricky as they help their mammas throw a RENT PARTY to save their house. All they need to do is get the ice, hand out some cards, oh - and get a real live musician to play.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Through the Looking Glass and into the Heart of the Community.</u></h3>
<p><u><strong>What is Storm Fever Theatre and what are its aims? </strong></u></p>
<p>We are Storm Fever, a theatre company that is for everyday people who haven't acted before or haven't had their voices heard. We specialise in helping people with underlying mental health issues and/or people who have never had the opportunity to perform. This project has been set up to help people express themselves and get out of their heads and everyday lives. They use art as a safe place to explore characters and scenarios they never would have done before and learn from it. We also feel in our cast that age is but a number and doesn't define you as a person. We have cast members ranging from 22-85 which means that as a theatre community we can conquer any age barriers that have been set in modern day society.</p>
<p><u><strong>So what is the play and what's the main aims of this production? </strong> </u></p>
<p>Play is on he 22nd of February at 6pm. Doors open 5.45pm. East Oxford Community Centre.</p>
<p>Wonderland is a place where anything is possible and we have decided to call our project after Alice and this well known children's fairy tale.  However, this production will have a environmental twist and therefore will simply be called 'Alice with a Twist.'

What is Storm Fever Theatre and what are its aims? 
We are Storm Fever, a theatre company that is for everyday people who haven't acted before or haven't had their voices heard. We specialise in helping people with underlying mental health issues and/or people who have never had the opportunity to perform. This project has been set up to help people express themselves and get out of their heads and everyday lives. They use art as a safe place to explore characters and scenarios they never would have done before and learn from it. We also feel in our cast that age is but a number and doesn't define you as a person. We have cast members ranging from 22-85 which means that as a theatre community we can conquer any age barriers that have been set in modern day society.
So what is the play and what's the main aims of this production?  
Play is on he 22nd of February at 6pm. Doors open 5.45pm. East Oxford Community Centre.
Wonderland is a place where anything is possible and we have decided to call our project after Alice and this well known children's fairy tale.  However, this production will have a environmental twist and therefore will simply be called 'Alice with a Twist.' In this tale, it starts at Alice's birthday party and then goes into a whirlwind adventure after being swept up by the rubbish tip outside her house. She is sad, confused and looking for her cat, but will she find a way out of this trash wonderland she finds herself in?

<h2>Fall of the House: A Synopsis</h2>
<p>A bitter author, a jealous friend, and a HOUSE that foretells death. Welcome to New York, 1839.</p>
<p>Part thriller, part detective story, part surrealist drama, Fall of the House is a play that uses movement, music and text to explore the extraordinary circumstances behind the writing of Edgar Allan Poe’s famous short story “The Fall of the House of Usher”: a tale which eerily mirrored Poe’s own life. </p>
<p>Set in three overlapping timelines, Fall of the House is the story of a man on the edge of sanity, a real-life murder plot, and a HOUSE that manipulates the nature of reality.</p> <p>Prepare yourself . The HOUSE is waiting.</p>

<p>Hello! We are the team behind ""Fall of the House"": a brand new hybrid theatrical work being created in New York City. We're a majority-female creative team that is criss-crossing genres to make a wholly new take on Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Fall of the House of Usher', which links fiction, documentary, mystery and fantasy into one truly unique and unforgettable play.</p>

<p><strong>1) This isn't your mother's Edgar Allan Poe show. Take it from our Assistant Choreographer, </strong><b>Jeanette Abell:</b></p>
<p><i>""Seeing through the layers of what was socially acceptable in the historical context of Poe’s lifetime, and being able to peel those away and modernize him in a theatrical work invites us to discover what lies at the root of our allure to Poe. In our own work, we often tell our own stories, share our vast secrets, our glowing victories, and despicable truths and fears. Unafraid to implore Poe’s emotional vulnerabilities for all to see, we plan to deliver the chance we all deserve to know and relate to Poe as a human, rather than a legend.</i></p>
<p><i>Also, we have The HOUSE,  intersecting timelines and Joseph Snodgrass. You don't even understand yet, but you will.""</i></p>

<p><i>""We must revisit renowned figures and their stories that we thought we knew with crisp and modern inquiries, as we have lenses at our disposal now that were not socially acceptable during the periods in which these figures lived. These lenses sometimes tell a more honest story. </i></p>
<p><i>Though  female figures had such a huge affect on Poe's life  (and indeed, are the reason we have a lot of his work in the first place - but more on that later), we don't hear from them in  our current history books. Therefore, a female perspective is an ideal framework to revisit Poe, especially given his biography.""</i></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Vladimir Kremenović and I am a Seattle-based artist premiering work at Velocity Dance Center’s upcoming Bridge Project 2019. The Bridge Project is a yearly performance showcasing Seattle’s most promising new talents in dance choreography. For this year’s Bridge, I am developing an original piece entitled <i>Shear Stress</i>, inspired by the mechanics of landslides – both geological and emotional. Working in collaboration with nine other dancers, my piece seeks to find resonances and intersections between the Pacific Northwest landscape and our personal experiences of drastic – and sometimes destructive – change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the last month, my nine fellow dancers and I have spent over 48 hours developing, evolving, and practicing this complex piece in an accelerated preparation for its upcoming premiere. I aim to raise enough money from the local community to fairly compensate each of my performers for their dedication to this intensive process. The dancers are: Kara Beadle, Elise Beers, Gabby Bilka, Anna Joswiak, Sage King, Amy Nielsen, Leah Russell, Rachel Wu and Andy Zacek.</p>
<p>Whether you can attend our performance on January 31<sup>st</sup> – February 3<sup>rd</sup> or not, I hope you can show support for local artists by donating to this campaign or sharing the link. Working artists like myself depend on generous donations from the community to keep creating. Thank you for your support!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More About Me:</p>
<p>Immigrant performer and filmmaker Vladimir Kremenović originally hails from Banja Luka, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. He graduated from Middlebury College in 2017 with a joint degree in dance and film. He has studied under Christal Brown, Trebien Pollard, Tzveta Kassabova, Gabriel Forestieri, Katie Martin, and Andrea Olson. Based out of Seattle since 2017, he has most recently performed with Heather Kravas, Mellissa Riker, Petra Zanki, Jordan Macintosh-Hougham, and Noelle Price. The Bridge Project marks his first original work to premiere in Seattle. His choreography draws inspiration from dance theater, as well as postmodern elements such as repetition, variation, and improvisation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More About <i>Shear Stress</i>:</p>
<p>            “Landslides occur when gravitational and other types of shear stresses within a slope exceed the strength of the materials that form the slope.” In exploring this piece, I focused not so much on the landslide itself as an event, but rather the unseen processes foreshadowing this destruction. I seek to draw correlations between landslides in geology, in society, and in our personal lives. When does stress reach a breaking point where collapse becomes inevitable? How does this destruction manifest itself in the environment, our political systems, our emotions? Is there catharsis in catastrophe?</p>

<h3><strong>Who the heck is Tara?</strong></h3>
<p>Hey there! My name's Tara. I'm an actor, comic, wife and mum. I've been up to a few things over the last few years, including performing at some great comedy venues, directing the five star sell out show 'NewsRevue', working with amazing writers like Fay Weldon, and actors like Nicole Kidman, and most recently/importantly, being a full time mum to two beautiful boys. Something I've always dreamt of doing was taking my own show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and now we are making that dream a reality. I've been testing out material on my children, as well as audiences made up of adult humans.. and they've been laughing, which is a great sign. I have confirmed Just The Tonic as the venue, which is one of the best comedy venues at the Edinburgh Fringe, and I also have previews booked in for Brighton Festival, the Oxford Comedy Festival, Hungerford Summer Arts Festival as well as venues in London and Guilford. </p>
<h3><strong>What this show means to me</strong></h3>
<p>This show means a lot to me because it's not just about making people laugh, it's also about bringing people together and breaking down stigma. Yes there are jokes about group pelvic floor exercises and googling how to change a nappy, but I also touch on some heavier topics. I had three miscarriages before our first son was conceived, and during that time my husband and I felt completely heartbroken and very alone. I had no idea how common miscarriages are, because no one talks about them. I also didn't realise that it was possible to be lonely as a new parent, or how isolated women with post natal depression could feel. So as a way of getting people to open up more, I decided to write some jokes about it! Oh great, miscarriage and loneliness jokes.. Sounds like a really fun show.. Honestly though, in this social media driven, genuine-connection-starved world, now more than ever we need a supportive and understanding community - for parents, people who want to be parents, and even people who never want to be parents because they really can't stand kids. </p>
<h3><strong>What your support can do</strong></h3>
<p>Regardless of whether we get extra funding, this show is going to Edinburgh Fringe Festival (I've signed contracts, and if I don't go through with it, I believe I go to contract jail?). But with your support, it can not only 'happen' - it can actually be successful! A huge part of getting people through the door, getting articles written, and getting that book tour is marketing! And marketing is expensive.. That's on top of accommodation (couch surfing is not an option with two babies.. they're super demanding), the venue guarantee, poster design, travel costs.. it's a long list. So any donation or help is very much appreciated! </p>
<p><strong>What sponsorship will go towards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Technical overheads for the month </li>
<li> Ed Fringe venue hire for the month </li>
<li> Marketing &amp; PR </li>
<li> Poster/Flyer design &amp; printing</li>
<li> Accommodation &amp; travel</li>

</div></div>","Who the heck is Tara?
Hey there! My name's Tara. I'm an actor, comic, wife and mum. I've been up to a few things over the last few years, including performing at some great comedy venues, directing the five star sell out show 'NewsRevue', working with amazing writers like Fay Weldon, and actors like Nicole Kidman, and most recently/importantly, being a full time mum to two beautiful boys. Something I've always dreamt of doing was taking my own show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and now we are making that dream a reality. I've been testing out material on my children, as well as audiences made up of adult humans.. and they've been laughing, which is a great sign. I have confirmed Just The Tonic as the venue, which is one of the best comedy venues at the Edinburgh Fringe, and I also have previews booked in for Brighton Festival, the Oxford Comedy Festival, Hungerford Summer Arts Festival as well as venues in London and Guilford. 
What this show means to me
This show means a lot to me because it's not just about making people laugh, it's also about bringing people together and breaking down stigma. Yes there are jokes about group pelvic floor exercises and googling how to change a nappy, but I also touch on some heavier topics. I had three miscarriages before our first son was conceived, and during that time my husband and I felt completely heartbroken and very alone. I had no idea how common miscarriages are, because no one talks about them. I also didn't realise that it was possible to be lonely as a new parent, or how isolated women with post natal depression could feel. So as a way of getting people to open up more, I decided to write some jokes about it! Oh great, miscarriage and loneliness jokes.. Sounds like a really fun show.. Honestly though, in this social media driven, genuine-connection-starved world, now more than ever we need a supportive and understanding community - for parents, people who want to be parents, and even people who never want to be parents because they really can't stand kids. 
What your support can do
Regardless of whether we get extra funding, this show is going to Edinburgh Fringe Festival (I've signed contracts, and if I don't go through with it, I believe I go to contract jail?). But with your support, it can not only 'happen' - it can actually be successful! A huge part of getting people through the door, getting articles written, and getting that book tour is marketing! And marketing is expensive.. That's on top of accommodation (couch surfing is not an option with two babies.. they're super demanding), the venue guarantee, poster design, travel costs.. it's a long list. So any donation or help is very much appreciated! 
What sponsorship will go towards:

Technical overheads for the month 
 Ed Fringe venue hire for the month 
 Marketing & PR 
 Poster/Flyer design & printing
 Accommodation & travel

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Performers and athletes devote their entire lives to their passion. It’s a 24/7 job that tests your limits everyday both mentally and physically. Dancers are athletes that have chosen one of the most difficult professions in life, some are born to do it, and others learn to master it. But what happens to a dancer when they suffer a career-ending injury before they’re ready to retire? Their passion doesn’t end, their yearning to continue grows stronger, but they physically can’t continue or are told they can’t continue and now find themselves stuck and forced to find a different life. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A new life no amount of training has prepared them for. They have to re-discover themselves and find a new place in the vast world.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal with this movie is to share insight to the dedication and discipline required for a dancer to endure through physical and psychological recovery. Having a strong story mixed with original music and exciting dance sequences allows us not only to make a visually beautiful film, but a powerful one as well.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457565035/sox8funwti9wwtwxet53.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;cursor: nw-resize;background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>Synopsis – One week before her opening debut as lead, a principal ballerina suffers a career-ending injury and is forced to find a new life outside the world of dance. But when she befriends a gifted composer with writer’s block, she falls for his unlikely charm and must learn to overcome her fear of permanent injury or settle for an unfulfilling life.</p>
<p>Featuring over 10 original songs created solely for the movie, exciting new dance sequences of varying styles, and a powerful emotional story, BACK TO 1 shines a spotlight on the life of a performer’s emotional struggle during physical rehabilitation and her journey to closure.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457565066/anqqpmnsxxhslmrwdr7s.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>The entire budget for BACK TO 1 is $5 million. Our goal of $50,000 on INDIEGOGO will cover the remaining development funds needed to get us into official pre-production. Should we be lucky enough to hit our desired goal the campaign will then become an InDemand campaign unlocking more exciting perks for backer’s allowing us to continue to make this movie properly. The more we raise, the more roadblocks get cleared, the quicker we can shoot, the faster we will get it released, the quicker you get to see it!!! We sadly can’t do it alone.</p>
<p>Our estimated time of completion once we've raised the full amount required to shoot is one year! By supporting us on INDIEGOGO you will get exclusive insights to the creation of BACK TO 1. No perks released through INDIEGOGO will be released elsewhere. Different marketing tools and behind the scenes content will be released to the general public when the time comes. </p>

<p><b>Director’s Statement</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dance is a huge part of entertainment today with shows like Dancing With The Stars and So You Think You Can Dance. The story of BACK TO 1 shows the overwhelming struggle of a ballerina forced to find a new life outside the dance world while not wanting to give up on what she was born to do. Being a dancer, I want to see a film with strong characters that incorporates powerful themes about family, support, love of the arts, and finding inner strength on a courageous journey of perseverance. Those elements combined with beautiful imagery capturing the movement of extroadinary dance sequences set to original music, makes this protagonist’s story one that audiences might talk about for years to come.</p>

<b>When will I get my Perks?</b>
</div>
<div>All clothing, and poster perks will be made once the campaign ends and shipped out as soon as possible. The POC Trailer perk will be sent directly to you once the campaign ends. The digital script will be sent out the day the movie is released. The Video Blogs will be sent to you as soon as they are completed. Since the Video Blogs document the entire movie making process (pre-production, production, and post-production) we will have one Video Blog a month. You will be notified as soon as each Video Blog is ready.  If you donated for the Screening, Scoring, Set Visit, Dance in the Movie, Associate Producer, and Co-Executive Producer perk, you will be notified about the specific dates attached to each one.</div>
<div><b>How do I tell you what my clothing sizes are so my perks will fit me?</b></div>
<div>After the campaign ends we will send a size sheet for you to fill out and return to us so we can get you the correct sizes.</div>
<div><b>What happens if you don't hit your goal?</b></div>
<div>We've decided to use INDIEGOGO's flexible funding function. Our team is very proactive in making this movie a reality and all donations will be used toward the movie only. Any and all donations will help get this movie made regardless if we hit our goal or not. You will get your desired perks.</div>
<div><b>Will Chucky and Bonnie do video shout outs?</b></div>
<div>Maybe if enough people ask nicely on our social media pages. They are both extremely busy and hard working, but if you want to hear from them we're relatively certain something can be worked out.</div>
<div><b>Will there be more screenings in different cities?</b></div>
<div>If there is a demand for it, we would be happy to add extra city screenings as a perk. Let us know on our INDIEGOGO, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, and TWITTER pages which city you would like to see BACK TO 1 in before it's released. </div>
<div><b>Oh no! I purchased my perk but I used the wrong information, or I moved, and fear that it won't get to me. What do I do?</b></div>
<div>Not to worry. Just send us an e-mail at info@backto1film.com and we'll update your information to make sure you get your perk.</div>
<div><b>I'm an Actor, Singer, Dancer -- Can I audition to be in the movie?</b></div>
<div>Yes. When we start casting the supporting roles, featured dancer and singer roles, we will be looking for the best fits to join BACK TO 1. Keep your ears open to the music and when casting notices become available we look forward to meeting you. Please note: There is no guarantee you will get cast. (This doesn't apply to the DANCE IN THE MOVIE perk)</div>

Doug worked as a professional dancer on Disney's High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year where he befriended the emmy award winning choreographers Bonnie Story & Chucky Klapow. Bonnie Story & Chucky Klapow will re-team with Doug to bring all the amazing dance sequences to life.

Performers and athletes devote their entire lives to their passion. It’s a 24/7 job that tests your limits everyday both mentally and physically. Dancers are athletes that have chosen one of the most difficult professions in life, some are born to do it, and others learn to master it. But what happens to a dancer when they suffer a career-ending injury before they’re ready to retire? Their passion doesn’t end, their yearning to continue grows stronger, but they physically can’t continue or are told they can’t continue and now find themselves stuck and forced to find a different life. A new life no amount of training has prepared them for. They have to re-discover themselves and find a new place in the vast world.
 
Our goal with this movie is to share insight to the dedication and discipline required for a dancer to endure through physical and psychological recovery. Having a strong story mixed with original music and exciting dance sequences allows us not only to make a visually beautiful film, but a powerful one as well.

 
Synopsis – One week before her opening debut as lead, a principal ballerina suffers a career-ending injury and is forced to find a new life outside the world of dance. But when she befriends a gifted composer with writer’s block, she falls for his unlikely charm and must learn to overcome her fear of permanent injury or settle for an unfulfilling life.
Featuring over 10 original songs created solely for the movie, exciting new dance sequences of varying styles, and a powerful emotional story, BACK TO 1 shines a spotlight on the life of a performer’s emotional struggle during physical rehabilitation and her journey to closure.


The entire budget for BACK TO 1 is $5 million. Our goal of $50,000 on INDIEGOGO will cover the remaining development funds needed to get us into official pre-production. Should we be lucky enough to hit our desired goal the campaign will then become an InDemand campaign unlocking more exciting perks for backer’s allowing us to continue to make this movie properly. The more we raise, the more roadblocks get cleared, the quicker we can shoot, the faster we will get it released, the quicker you get to see it!!! We sadly can’t do it alone.
Our estimated time of completion once we've raised the full amount required to shoot is one year! By supporting us on INDIEGOGO you will get exclusive insights to the creation of BACK TO 1. No perks released through INDIEGOGO will be released elsewhere. Different marketing tools and behind the scenes content will be released to the general public when the time comes. 
 

 

You can help BACK TO 1 in a multitude of ways. Okay, actually just two. You can donate to the BACK TO 1 campaign by choosing your desired PERK level and getting exclusive updates, behind the scenes content, super comfortable swag, or even a set visit to see the film made in front of your very eyes!!! 
Also you can follow us and the campaign right here on INDIEGOGO, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, INSTAGRAM, and TUMBLR telling your friends, family, colleagues, professors, film professors, dance companies, dance teachers, musicians, MICK JAGGER, singing coaches, someone at JUILLIARD, or the NEW YORK CITY BALLET COMPANY, USC and UCLA film schools, STEVEN SPIELBERG (he likes musicals, he said so in the making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, true story) and every other film school in existence, someone in CHINA, your favorite STARBUCKS, COFFEE BEAN, or PETE'S COFFEE BARISTA, your acting, singing, writing, directing, cinematography agent at WME, CAA, GERSH, UTA, or just tell JEREMY PIVEN 'cause ARI GOLD gets it done, and your neighbors dog or cat to help spread the word about BACK TO 1. You get the idea. (High Five)

This movie is being produced independently. All donations will go straight to the movie’s budget allowing us full creative freedom to make the movie we want to make.
This means we will be able to hire the name cast, crew, and shoot in the right locations. In other words, hire industry professionals and pay them accordingly. 
Should we be lucky enough to reach our goal these are among the first steps that will happen.
 

Music Team will create all the remaining songs for the movie.
Finish casting the entire film and have our leads go into training.
Lock down locations, and begin building the sets.

By then we will be out of development and in official pre-production. YAY GO TEAM!
 

 

We have assembled an amazing team of professionals from all aspects of the industry. Check us out and what we do!

Director’s Statement
 
Dance is a huge part of entertainment today with shows like Dancing With The Stars and So You Think You Can Dance. The story of BACK TO 1 shows the overwhelming struggle of a ballerina forced to find a new life outside the dance world while not wanting to give up on what she was born to do. Being a dancer, I want to see a film with strong characters that incorporates powerful themes about family, support, love of the arts, and finding inner strength on a courageous journey of perseverance. Those elements combined with beautiful imagery capturing the movement of extroadinary dance sequences set to original music, makes this protagonist’s story one that audiences might talk about for years to come.

Charles “Chucky” Klapow- is a choreographer/television personality whose work spans two decades. He was one of the dancers chosen for Michael Jackson’s This Is It concert tour. Chucky is a two-time Emmy Award Nominee for outstanding choreography, winning in 2006 for his work on Disney Channel’s High School Musical. He starred as an on-camera judge in Australia’s Young Talent Time (Network Ten), Don’t Stop Believing in the UK (Channel Five), and China’s Up Juniors (Hunan TV). Chucky spent 2013 and 2014 as choreographer for The Rolling Stones on their 50 & Counting, 14 On Fire world tours, the Zip Code US national tour, and just completed the Olé 2016 tour.
 
Bonnie Story – Is one of the country's most in demand choreographers, whose work was recently featured on the hit FOX dance show So You Think You Can Dance. She received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography, along with Charles Klapow for their work on High School Musical. Bonnie's credits include choreography for the feature film Dear Dumb Diary, America's Greatest Pastime, Suite Life of Zack and Cody, and numerous Disney Channel segments featuring Ashley Tisdale, Miley Cyrus (Hannah Montana), the Muppets and both the Sugar Bowl and Orange Bowl Half Time shows in New Orleans and Miami. She has done choreography for the films American Mall (MTV Films), Rock N Roll Forever, and High School Musical 3. Bonnie choreographed commercials for the Ohio Zoo, Miche Bags and Zion's Bank. She was one of the choreographers for the new Cirque du Soliel show inspired by the music of Elvis, which is currently playing in Las Vegas at the City Center.



Thank you so much for checking out the BACK TO 1 CAMPAIGN. Check back for updates!!!

When will I get my Perks?

All clothing, and poster perks will be made once the campaign ends and shipped out as soon as possible. The POC Trailer perk will be sent directly to you once the campaign ends. The digital script will be sent out the day the movie is released. The Video Blogs will be sent to you as soon as they are completed. Since the Video Blogs document the entire movie making process (pre-production, production, and post-production) we will have one Video Blog a month. You will be notified as soon as each Video Blog is ready.  If you donated for the Screening, Scoring, Set Visit, Dance in the Movie, Associate Producer, and Co-Executive Producer perk, you will be notified about the specific dates attached to each one.
How do I tell you what my clothing sizes are so my perks will fit me?
After the campaign ends we will send a size sheet for you to fill out and return to us so we can get you the correct sizes.
What happens if you don't hit your goal?
We've decided to use INDIEGOGO's flexible funding function. Our team is very proactive in making this movie a reality and all donations will be used toward the movie only. Any and all donations will help get this movie made regardless if we hit our goal or not. You will get your desired perks.
Will Chucky and Bonnie do video shout outs?
Maybe if enough people ask nicely on our social media pages. They are both extremely busy and hard working, but if you want to hear from them we're relatively certain something can be worked out.
Will there be more screenings in different cities?
If there is a demand for it, we would be happy to add extra city screenings as a perk. Let us know on our INDIEGOGO, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, and TWITTER pages which city you would like to see BACK TO 1 in before it's released. 
Oh no! I purchased my perk but I used the wrong information, or I moved, and fear that it won't get to me. What do I do?
Not to worry. Just send us an e-mail at info@backto1film.com and we'll update your information to make sure you get your perk.
I'm an Actor, Singer, Dancer -- Can I audition to be in the movie?
Yes. When we start casting the supporting roles, featured dancer and singer roles, we will be looking for the best fits to join BACK TO 1. Keep your ears open to the music and when casting notices become available we look forward to meeting you. Please note: There is no guarantee you will get cast.

 Salon Drama is an edgy, comical, inspirational, and unforgettable stage play with a timeless message for all ages. It was written and directed by Sulondia ""Sue-Ham"" Hammond. (also known as Sue-Ham Baby)  






We are raising funds to bring this stage play to DVD. Our play will also premier at a movie theater in South Carolina which we will make open to the public. The DVD will also include behind the scenes footage and interviews with the cast.

Our goal is to have a finish product by October 2016 -- lots of work goes into preproduction, production, and post production --- We know that with your help we can take the message of this play WORLDWIDE!
We will keep you updated the entire time as to where we are with the project.


Below is a brief description of where the money will go and details about the stage play and cast!





Sulondia ""Sue-Ham"" Hammond, that's me and I just happened to be, well rather I am blessed to be an author, playwright, and director.  My body of work includes, but is not limited to The Sue-Ham TV Show, The Sue-Ham Radio Show, Flippin' Da Script stage play and I Am Who I Say I Am stage play. 
I have also been seen on several social media networks with my viral beat boxing video which aired nationally on BET (Black Entertainment Television).  I have also been featured on BravoTV hosting Queen Brooklyn's Health and Beauty Expo.
Just recently I  was selected by renowned playwright, director, and producer,   David E. Talbert (director of 1st Sunday and Baggage Claim), to join the cast for the film, ""A Meyers Christmas,"" which is being released through Universal Pictures Nov 2016 and includes such talent as Danny Glover, Monique, Kimberly Elise, and many others!  (see pics below)
My latest creation is my stage play, Salon Drama. Because of all the requests to commit this show to DVD, I am seeking your help to make it happen!








My breath taking stage play, Salon Drama, focuses on the life of an upcoming stylist, small town girl, who has BIG aspirations to be a worldwide cosmetologist and entrepreneur. This play elaborately details the struggles Shaneka endures on her journey to success in such a hard industry --- the HAIR industry!  
Salon Drama compels viewers to never give up on their hopes and dreams, no matter the obstacles and hardships experienced along the way. It drives the message home that regardless of where you are, you can get to where you’re going, if only you employ faith, persistence, and talent.  
This edgy, thought provoking, uplifting, emotional, and incredibly funny play has left audiences yearning for an encore.  (videos, pics, and testimonials below)

Hello!


My name is Nick Lande and I am an Honest Magician. I'm creating this fundraiser because my dream is to travel and share real magic with the communities I visit. Real magic? Yes! I want to give away money at every Honest Magic Show. The money would go to Nature, Science, and Education Centers in the communities we perform in. The money raised by a town stays in that town and continues to create local magic. 


What are we raising money for? Three things.



1. The majority of this fundraiser will be used this April with a free to the public Honest Magic Show. We will be featuring: www.campodayin.org.  Camp Odayin provides fun, safe and supportive camp experiences and community building opportunities for young people with heart disease and their families. I have had the joy of performing at a few of these camps and want to feature their wonderful work in an Honest Magic Show. At which we will give them money raised here. 


2. An Honest Magic Show has been a part of the festival for two years now and we think it is the perfect place to generate buzz and press for a Minnesota give back tour. The fee to perform in the festival is $450 and money from this fundraiser would help to cover the fee. There is a small chance we will not be able to perform this year because the festival operates on a lottery system. If that happens all money from this fundraiser would go towards our April show and:

3. Any money raised past the $1,000 mark would go towards the operating budget of an Honest Magic Tour. Currently set for March 2017, we'll need the time and a more accurate budget to plan and connect with the groups we want to donate to across Minnesota. Groups like:Camp Odayin www.campodayin.org
Project Success www.projectsuccess.org
Science Museum of Minnesota www.smm.org






In order to do real magic though it takes a lot of help.  That's where you come in:


We'll be working all year to find other sources of income to support this work, but none of the grants we'll apply for mean quite the same as a well funded crowd sourced campaign:  By donating you will be creating magic and opportunities with a butterfly effect across the state of Minnesota.

You will be contributing to a travelling message, making thousands feel inspired, supported, and entertained.
 You will bring communities together for a night that can make a lot of difference in the lives of many you may never meet, but certainly are affected by.



Obviously there are some challenges ahead. Is $2,000 enough? What happens if we don't raise enough to give away $1,000? It's ok!   A goal of this fundraiser is to create buzz early on so that come March 2017 it will be easier for larger corporate sponsors to help fund the tour. 

 Many spaces that we visit will also donate their costs to the give back tour making it easier to give money away while also creating excellent advertising and public relations for our partners. 
    Do not fret if you cannot contribute. There are so many other things you can do to help:  Share this fundraiser with friends you think might help. It's really easy with Indiegogo's share tools!

</h3><h3>Hi, we are A.N.O.N Productions, a theatre company dedicated to producing plays by, adapted from, and inspired by The Bard.</h3>
<h3>After our successful run of Hamlet in November earlier this year, it was clear that this show was not yet over and now we want to bring it back to reach more people.</h3>
<p>ABOUT THIS PRODUCTION OF HAMLET: This production was inspired by issues raised by the He For She campaign and the desire to make the characters and issues of the show gender universal (after all, there is female protagonist of a Shakespearian tragedy, and yet the themes and issues of Hamlet relate just as much to women. Likewise Ophelia's issues can very much resonate with men.) It's set ever so slightly in the future in a highly militarized society where Hamlet is a woman who has been raised as a man for succession purposes. Ophelia is a slightly effeminate, sensitive (in contrast to the militarized society) man, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are the ""Queen Bees"" of Wittenberg, and Horatio is the only high ranking woman in the military (all the other roles are ""gender appropriate."")</p>
<p>However, in order to get started we need your help. We are looking to raise $2500 to help pay for rehearsal space, performance space and our wonderful actors, technicians and everyone else involved with this awesome production.</p>
<p>We thank you for any assistance, and in return, we will grant you some special perks. </p>

<p style=""font-style: italic;""></p></div>","WE ARE PART OF HISTORY - BE PART OF OUR FUTURE 
For over 35 years, Studio 210 has
been a haven for creation, innovation, and opportunity allowing Bay Area’s
diverse artists to thrive and give back to their admiring communities. Because
of believers like you, Studio 210 continues to thrive, allowing working artists
to share their passions.The Studio has given so much, today it is your turn (performers, teachers, audience members, students, and patrons alike) to give back.With your support, we can tackle the vital renovations and improvements needed:- New Curtains and Tracks- New Paint- New LED Theater Lights- New Audio and Video Equipment (ah, digital!)- New SeatingOur next big goal is a refurbishment of the curtains (a big financial chunk), as they have taken a beating in the past three decades. Help us start our 36th year right!


WHO IS STUDIO 210? Studio 210 is home base to Deborah Slater Dance Theater. Since the theatre space was founded in 1980, it has drawn in hundreds of dancers, actors, & photographers. In the past year alone, Studio 210 has opened its doors for over thirty long term renters, multiple performances, showcases, and open workshops. Home to the Studio 210 Summer Residency Program, offering free rehearsal space, mentorship, and performance opportunities to emerging & established artists, it is one of the few remaining affordable spaces in the Mission.
""Studio 210 is where dancers magically hide out and experiment. What is beautiful about this studio, that is different from every other studio that we get to work in, and I work in a lot of them, is that this one is somehow hidden and more contained, which allows for another kind of magic to happen. There is this sense of protection for failure and innovation, for not knowing how to proceed, for wandering in shadows, for playing the fool, for attempting the impossible.""Keith Hennessy (award winning d​ancer, choreographer, educator and performance artist)

THANK YOU ARTISTS AND PATRONS COMMUNITY The past quarter of a century would not have been possible
without the outside help of students, patrons, teachers and others like you.
 We hope you consider support for a space that has kept going
continuously, serving its mission, since l980, no small feat in the world of
the performing arts! The Studio has given so much, today it is our turn (performers, teachers, audience members, students, and patrons alike) to give back.

<li>To help us pay our bills. [We receive no major grants and rely on donations, fundraising and ticket money]</li>
<li>To help us pay for great sets, costumes, and props.</li>
<li>To help us pay increased stipends to our actors, directors and creatives.

</h2> <ul> <li>
<h2><b>Can we toot our own  horn? </b></h2>
<h2></h2>
</li>
<li><b>Here is a short list of some of our achievements:</b></li>
<li>
<b>Time Out</b> said that The Secret is among the top 50 theatres in NYC. Twice.</li>
<li>In our 10 year history we calculate that we have served over 100,000 customers many of these also become customers of other local businesses like <b>LIC Market, Court Square Diner, Tost, The Shannon Pot, Gaw Gai</b> and many, many others.</li>
<li>Over <b>3000</b> artists have performed at The Secret - many of these artists have been able to get their agents, mangers and to find other projects with a respected Secret Theatre credit on their resume.<br/>
</li>
<li>All of the realtors and property developers have used the existence of <b>The Secret</b> and other cultural organizations to promote the diversity and ambience of what is now one of the hottest places in NYC to move to. We want to continue to contribute to that LIC 'feeling'.<br/>
</li>
<li>Playbill in July named <b>The Secret Theatre</b> alongside BAM in Brooklyn, <b>St George</b> in Staten Island, <b>The Lehman</b> in Bronx as <b><i>the </i></b>theatre in Queens. To be compared to giant organizations like BAM or the Lehman Performing Arts center is a huge honor. <a href=""http://playbill.com/news/article/hit-the-boroughs-five-theatres-you-should-visit-outside-manhattan-352095"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playbill Article </a>or on the picture for the full article.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450234790/thtywxrhyiwmpq0z5ova.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p> </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We created the first real theatre in LIC in 2005 before the area became incredibly hip.  However, its well known that after an area is colonized by artists that they are the first casualties once the area takes off.     Recently it was announced that another local theatre, The Chain would be closing in early 2016. [The Chain was created by ex-Secret Theatre staff].   The rising rents and pressure from an overheated Long Island City property market are making life challenging for arts related businesses like ours. The irony is that we are among several cultural projects that help to gentrify and make the area attractive but now we are in danger of becoming a victim to this success.<br/>
</li> <li>We need you and we certainly hope you would agree that you need us. The area where we are located is in the middle of an exciting expansion but the residents both new and old need the area to be more than just a series of glass towers without amenities.  Besides all of the in house and rental projects we are also partners with great local organizations like <b>The Queens World Film Festival, The LIC School of Ballet, LIC Academy of Music, Queens New Music Festival, Queensboro Dance Festival</b>. We provide classes to local children and offer the only professional theatre environment for children to <br/>

To help us pay increased stipends to our actors, directors and creatives. [Most off off theatre is performed by unpaid actors hoping for credits and reviews - this is because the typically low off off Broadway ticket price of $18 vs NYC rents and other expenses make wages for performers a remote and distant hope]




You give to us and we give to you!
If you are able to donate we have some incredible rewards including a limited run T shirt speically designed by one of LIC's most celebrated artists, Luba Lukova, tickets to shows, subscriptions and other gift ideas.
Want to get professional acting or coaching for your budding young actor? Our rewards include a limited amount of places in the Academy at reduced rates and you will be helping us at the same time!

If we don't reach our entire goal we are most likely going to use what we raise for items 1 and 2 in the above list.  We will also run a separate sponsorship campaign to the many local businesses that support us even as we help to bring customers to the area.
    What is special about this Secret?
  
Can we toot our own  horn? 


Here is a short list of some of our achievements:

Time Out said that The Secret is among the top 50 theatres in NYC. Twice.
In our 10 year history we calculate that we have served over 100,000 customers many of these also become customers of other local businesses like LIC Market, Court Square Diner, Tost, The Shannon Pot, Gaw Gai and many, many others.
Over 3000 artists have performed at The Secret - many of these artists have been able to get their agents, mangers and to find other projects with a respected Secret Theatre credit on their resume.

All of the realtors and property developers have used the existence of The Secret and other cultural organizations to promote the diversity and ambience of what is now one of the hottest places in NYC to move to. We want to continue to contribute to that LIC 'feeling'.

Playbill in July named The Secret Theatre alongside BAM in Brooklyn, St George in Staten Island, The Lehman in Bronx as the theatre in Queens. To be compared to giant organizations like BAM or the Lehman Performing Arts center is a huge honor. Playbill Article or on the picture for the full article. 


We created the first real theatre in LIC in 2005 before the area became incredibly hip.  However, its well known that after an area is colonized by artists that they are the first casualties once the area takes off.     Recently it was announced that another local theatre, The Chain would be closing in early 2016. [The Chain was created by ex-Secret Theatre staff].   The rising rents and pressure from an overheated Long Island City property market are making life challenging for arts related businesses like ours. The irony is that we are among several cultural projects that help to gentrify and make the area attractive but now we are in danger of becoming a victim to this success.
 We need you and we certainly hope you would agree that you need us. The area where we are located is in the middle of an exciting expansion but the residents both new and old need the area to be more than just a series of glass towers without amenities.  Besides all of the in house and rental projects we are also partners with great local organizations like The Queens World Film Festival, The LIC School of Ballet, LIC Academy of Music, Queens New Music Festival, Queensboro Dance Festival. We provide classes to local children and offer the only professional theatre environment for children to 
 



We recognize that there are many campaigns to contribute to and its easy to feel you already did your part but we sincerely ask you to consider donating at any level you feel comfortable with - every single dollar will help us. 
We have made it this far and we think its actually a long, long way.  

We also promise to always strive to achieve nothing more than perfection. Even when we fail to reach this divine level we help to contribute to the rich traditions and help to enrich a very special place, Long Island City.

</div></div>","Hello! 
Welcome to our crowd
funding page for Correspondence, a new play by Lucinda Burnett, premièring at
the Old Red Lion Theatre, London from 8 March to 2 April 2016.
Blythe Stewart will directs Lucinda Burnett’s powerful new witty drama Correspondence, a
bittersweet story of fledgling friendships and mental health set between Stockport and Syria on the
brink of the Arab Spring. 
This production will coincide with the 5th anniversary of the Syrian
Revolution.
We have developed this play
with actors, mental health charity SANE, Doctors and experts in mental
health and psychosis, the British Red Cross, and some lovely Syrians...and now
WE NEED YOU!

   
Why We Need You
We have been given a four
week run of Correspondence at the Old Red Lion Theatre in Islington, London and
have raised a significant amount of funding needed through trusts, funds, investment and generous donations.
However, we still have a
little more to raise, to ensure this production is of the highest quality and
reaches our identified audiences; to raise the profile of our talented artists
and also raise awareness of the two core themes in Correspondence – mental health and the
Syrian crisis.


The £1,000 we are asking you for
will pay our brilliant Press Representative Chris Hislop - www.chrishislop.com to get press coverage
for Correspondence and ensure reviewers attend the show, achieving our artistic
goals in supporting Lucinda Burnett’s first full length, professional run.  
Your
support will also go towards our marketing materials and campaign ensuring that we
reach our target audiences and raise awareness.
   

The Impact
This play
has been developed over a long period of time with a wealth of wonderful people
and organisations, and it would mean the world to have your support in helping
us finally present this play in the professional, full-length run it deserves.
The run of
Correspondence coincides with the 5th anniversary of the start of the
Syrian outbreak (13th March, 2011 was when it all sadly began) and
we want to talk about this as well as mental health, which affects 1 in 4 of us but is
still a taboo subject.  
Correspondence specifically looks at the early signs of
psychosis in young people.

ABOUT THE PLAY
“If you’re in, you’re
in, no messing. This isn’t bunking off to Stockport, to play Laser Quest at
Grand Central. This is the kind of activity that sets us apart from the dross.”
Spring 2011.  Kate and Wills tie the knot whilst Syrian
teenagers are tortured for anti-government graffiti.
Ben is 16, and his
friend Jibreel has disappeared from Xbox Live. 
He thinks he’s mixed up in the protests in Syria – and he’ll risk
everything on a journey to find out the truth.
What happens when a
teenager from Stockport tries to stop the world exploding?

<h1>Lady Garden</h1>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Indiegogo Campaign was launched to raise the necessary funds for its research and development theatre workshop (stage 1). </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In my mind, Lady Garden, after it's research and development workshop and script writing phases, I see it opening on a West End stage. It's a dream and a vivid vision and it takes discipline (and a dash of obsession) to make it happen. </span></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.darrenbrealey.co.uk/#!crowd-funding/cxka"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lady Garden </a>is real actors, a real director, challenging the world, making us think and feel. It's a story about us. Lady Garden intends to be a story, told by us for our generation, to share with the future, intending to create a better world; such is the power of story telling. </p>
<p>The Lady Garden project is designed to build and create a new piece of womens' theatre based on a framework of creative ideas outlining a story about women, for women and told by women, working on a Garden Allotment in London. </p>
<p>The basis of the script will be created around a rainbow of women (and a transgender woman and a male actor), from a myriad of cultures and backgrounds, from diverse socio demographics, discussing universal women's concerns, and of many ages from the young to the young at heart. Ldy Garden won't be a caricature play.  </p>
<p>The main themes will include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Humanity</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Cultural and Diversity</li>
<li>Inclusion and Class</li>
<li>Challenge the perception of gender</li>
<li>Havens</li>
<li>Contrasts</li>
</ul>

<div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In London, the idea of creating this project has drawn great interest from a female director, four female actors, one transgender actor and one male actor. It's time to write a theatre script, for women in theatre, about women to allow real women to perform where their voices will be heard.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Lady Garden takes place in a garden allotment in the London area for the local community, focusing on the local community requirements, whether the main purpose of their visit is hibernation, a re-focus of mind and body, establishing a gardening routine, making new friends or to celebrate a special occasion, each woman has her patch of garden to either become a recluse or to reach out and communicate.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 15px !important;""><br/></p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Defined Method of Approach</h2>
<p>The Lady Garden project will be a collaborative process in which the playwright / creative producer will provide a framework upon which the Lady Garden script will be created, defined by the female director, four female actors, one transgender actor and one male actor.</p>
<p>The director and actors <span style=""background-color: initial;"">will work in</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> collaboration to workshop the framework into a production ready, full length stage script. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The director and actors will work with the playwright to determine the path of the story, plot and character outcomes.</p>
<p>The playwright will form part of the decision making process in line with the director to decide upon story relevance, strength of plot and character driven ideas, making final decisions on the story’s path, framework and dialogue. All this, culminated from the collaborative work completed with the actors.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Research and Development</h2>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Using the framework of creative ideas, the director and actors will decide what story to tell and how they tell it. Through a collaborative process, they will generate an organic storyline by researching their characters, the world in which those characters live and how they cohabitate. </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The full length stage script will formulate a ‘stage 2 project’ plan with an outlook of mounting a fully staged professional production, engaging the original team.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">A common problem in theatre is a lack of available good quality scripts for women, real women (not a caricature), for older woman and for women from diverse backgrounds. The Lady Garden project will provide:</p>
<ul style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
<li>a strong, diverse, powerful and compassionate story for women about women.</li>
<li>providing opportunity to work, to perform and speak with a strong voice.</li>
<li>a script told by women, constructed by women, for women.</li>

<h2></h2>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Our transparency is clear. Our obstacles at delivering such a powerful script include lack of funding and lack of ongoing financial support. The artists need to eat, support families and be part of an equal equation. The artist's talents and passionate commitment to their art requires remuneration .</p>
<ul style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
<li>Your generous and appreciated financial support through donations will assist us to overcome our financial challenges.</li>
<li>Strong social media profiles, ongoing marketing and constant communication will assist our project immensely to avoid the risk of failing this project.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>The Playwright</h2>
<div>Darren Brealey has written over 30 plays and has had many of them produced around the globe; although he is not a global name. He is well known for his self confession about his writing, ""I don't write about Fairytale sunsets and I'm not about to start now."" He is a perceptive playwright with the ability to expose the flaws in the human condition, to hit home.</div>
<div>Brealey wrote and produced his first full length play before the age of 25 years and it won an Award for Best New Production in the 1996 Melbourne Fringe Festival Awards. With many awards, recognition and much work to show, Brealey tirelessly works on new theatre projects, assists others with their work and lives for the theatre. ""Theatre is what gets me out of bed in the morning"". </div>
<div>Lady Garden is a new piece of writing for Brealey, yet more importantly, a new way of working for him. Collaborating with a female Director, four female actors, one transgender actor and (for balance of scale) one male actor, this writing process will allow Brealey to work directly with creative input and work in a cohesive and collaborative process to create a new piece of amazing theatre. </div>
<div>His heritage is full of strong women. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>Project Deliverables and Desired Outcomes</h1>
<p>The desired deliverable of the Lady Garden project will be to deliver a production ready, full length stage script.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The desired outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the creation of new work in the theatre for women with powerful, embracing and inclusive dialogue with a positive message to women, about women</li>
<li>the creation of a new project plan to be called a ‘stage 2 project’ where funding is sought with a vision for a fully professionally produced production; once the current project life cycle has been delivered and considered a success</li>
<li>holding an award winning script for future productions of equity paid work, school productions and community theatre productions for women with an outcome to spread the positive messages in the Lady Garden script</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h2><b>Scope</b></h2>
<p>Lady Garden is an artistic project with the intent to deliver the following inclusions:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2> <p>The Lady Garden project is quite simple for Stage 1:</p> <ul> <li>Our budget for Stage 1 is simple, we want to (and need to) pay wages, venue hire, food, administration and insurance. This 15 day project will provide fully paid work for these artisans.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">With different levels of support for you to choose from, we'll pack a punch to match your generosity when you pick a perk. Should you wish to remain anonymous, we will respect your privacy. </span></li> </ul> </div> <div> <p><br/></p>

It would be amazing if you could share to the world on social media our desire to create our world class theatre by independent artists. We would love to be able to write the Lady Garden.</p><p>LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE</p><p>We are grateful and appreciate your donation and support.

Our Indiegogo Campaign was launched to raise the necessary funds for its research and development theatre workshop (stage 1). In my mind, Lady Garden, after it's research and development workshop and script writing phases, I see it opening on a West End stage. It's a dream and a vivid vision and it takes discipline (and a dash of obsession) to make it happen. 
Lady Garden is real actors, a real director, challenging the world, making us think and feel. It's a story about us. Lady Garden intends to be a story, told by us for our generation, to share with the future, intending to create a better world; such is the power of story telling. 
The Lady Garden project is designed to build and create a new piece of womens' theatre based on a framework of creative ideas outlining a story about women, for women and told by women, working on a Garden Allotment in London. 
The basis of the script will be created around a rainbow of women (and a transgender woman and a male actor), from a myriad of cultures and backgrounds, from diverse socio demographics, discussing universal women's concerns, and of many ages from the young to the young at heart. Ldy Garden won't be a caricature play.  
The main themes will include:


Humanity
Comedy
Cultural and Diversity
Inclusion and Class
Challenge the perception of gender
Havens
Contrasts




Background

In London, the idea of creating this project has drawn great interest from a female director, four female actors, one transgender actor and one male actor. It's time to write a theatre script, for women in theatre, about women to allow real women to perform where their voices will be heard.
Lady Garden takes place in a garden allotment in the London area for the local community, focusing on the local community requirements, whether the main purpose of their visit is hibernation, a re-focus of mind and body, establishing a gardening routine, making new friends or to celebrate a special occasion, each woman has her patch of garden to either become a recluse or to reach out and communicate.




Defined Method of Approach
The Lady Garden project will be a collaborative process in which the playwright / creative producer will provide a framework upon which the Lady Garden script will be created, defined by the female director, four female actors, one transgender actor and one male actor.
The director and actors will work in collaboration to workshop the framework into a production ready, full length stage script. 


The director and actors will work with the playwright to determine the path of the story, plot and character outcomes.
The playwright will form part of the decision making process in line with the director to decide upon story relevance, strength of plot and character driven ideas, making final decisions on the story’s path, framework and dialogue. All this, culminated from the collaborative work completed with the actors.

Research and Development
Using the framework of creative ideas, the director and actors will decide what story to tell and how they tell it. Through a collaborative process, they will generate an organic storyline by researching their characters, the world in which those characters live and how they cohabitate. 

The final outcome from the research and development workshop will deliver a final draft, production ready, full length stage script. 

The full length stage script will formulate a ‘stage 2 project’ plan with an outlook of mounting a fully staged professional production, engaging the original team.

The Impact
A common problem in theatre is a lack of available good quality scripts for women, real women (not a caricature), for older woman and for women from diverse backgrounds. The Lady Garden project will provide:

a strong, diverse, powerful and compassionate story for women about women.
providing opportunity to work, to perform and speak with a strong voice.
a script told by women, constructed by women, for women.


Risks & Challenges

Our transparency is clear. Our obstacles at delivering such a powerful script include lack of funding and lack of ongoing financial support. The artists need to eat, support families and be part of an equal equation. The artist's talents and passionate commitment to their art requires remuneration .

Your generous and appreciated financial support through donations will assist us to overcome our financial challenges.
Strong social media profiles, ongoing marketing and constant communication will assist our project immensely to avoid the risk of failing this project.


The Playwright
Darren Brealey has written over 30 plays and has had many of them produced around the globe; although he is not a global name. He is well known for his self confession about his writing, ""I don't write about Fairytale sunsets and I'm not about to start now."" He is a perceptive playwright with the ability to expose the flaws in the human condition, to hit home.
Brealey wrote and produced his first full length play before the age of 25 years and it won an Award for Best New Production in the 1996 Melbourne Fringe Festival Awards. With many awards, recognition and much work to show, Brealey tirelessly works on new theatre projects, assists others with their work and lives for the theatre. ""Theatre is what gets me out of bed in the morning"". 
Lady Garden is a new piece of writing for Brealey, yet more importantly, a new way of working for him. Collaborating with a female Director, four female actors, one transgender actor and (for balance of scale) one male actor, this writing process will allow Brealey to work directly with creative input and work in a cohesive and collaborative process to create a new piece of amazing theatre. 
His heritage is full of strong women. 

Project Deliverables and Desired Outcomes
The desired deliverable of the Lady Garden project will be to deliver a production ready, full length stage script.


The desired outcomes include:

the creation of new work in the theatre for women with powerful, embracing and inclusive dialogue with a positive message to women, about women
the creation of a new project plan to be called a ‘stage 2 project’ where funding is sought with a vision for a fully professionally produced production; once the current project life cycle has been delivered and considered a success
holding an award winning script for future productions of equity paid work, school productions and community theatre productions for women with an outcome to spread the positive messages in the Lady Garden script



Scope
Lady Garden is an artistic project with the intent to deliver the following inclusions:

humanity
comedy
challenging perceptions of gender
describe a haven
international characters and their cultures, views and experiences
contrasting stories about women
community spirit
a transgender character
sexual preference
financial standing
class / social standing
personality

They recently launched the 'Gerry' studio, a 60-seater space that runs opposite the main house, in which they have already successfully presented several well-received new shows similar to 'Custody'. We are looking for to raise £20,000 to kick start our play and get it on the road.We have managed to raise a small amount of seed money, which helped with our R & D phase and have strong interest from Arts Council England, who expect us to raise at least 40% percentage of our overall budget ourselves before they will consider offering us a grant.Whilst artists and creative people are often extremely generous with their time, many practical production costs are unavoidable, such as rehearsal and equipment hire, front-of-house and technical staff, touring accommodation and transportation costs to name a few. DONATION PERKSPlease check out our donation perks, and feel free to suggest new ones if you don't see what you would like from us.Please support by sharing this campaign on social media using #whoisbrian?  Twitter: @CustodyPlay    |     Facebook: @Custodyplay --------------------------------------- THE CUSTODY TEAM

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In March, several students from <i><a href=""http://www.exaltyouth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exalt</a> </i>(a development program for court-involved youth) and a New School student joined a bus of young people to meet with senators to advocate for the issue of Raise the Age. After talking with many senators and listening to the stories of graduates of <i>exalt</i>, as a team we recognized that these stories should be heard on a larger level and are fundamentally important to the passing of this law. This past summer, Eugene Lang  partnered with <i>exalt </i>to develop a performance, 16 Bars-Youth (Off)Ending Justice. The style of this piece is documentary theater, so the content is based off of interviews performed by the students with each other as well as facilitated by the teachers. The culminating performance will take place at a conference hosted by Eugene Lang professors, <u>Arts Advocacy: Youth in the System</u> also on the topic of Raise the Age. During the three day event, students will have the opportunity to meet CBOs working on this issue and plan and propose a related event. Friday, September 9th there will be a '<u>Thinking Out Loud'</u> event featuring successful artists who work with youth of color in New York City, including Liza Jessie Peterson, creator of <a href=""http://mappinternational.org/programs/view/250"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peculiar Patriot</a>, and Jamal Joseph, a teacher at Columbia University, former Black Panther and creator of <a href=""http://chapterandversethefilm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chapter and Verse</a>.</p>
<h3>Raise the Age</h3>
<p>New York and North Carolina are the only states that automatically try 16-17 year olds as adults. Latest scientific research shows that the frontal cortex (decision making part) of the brain is not fully developed until age 25. Violent offenders aged 13-15 are sometimes also prosecuted in adult court and receive adult level sentences. Youth housed in adult facilities are 36 times more likely to commit suicide than in youth facilities. 80% of young people released from adult facilities end up back in the prison system. Over 70% of the children and youth arrested are Black or Latino.  Of those sentenced to incarceration, 80% are Black and Latino.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The past two years Governor Cuomo has proposed a bill to raise the age of criminal responsibility which has been overturned both times. The house is very divided on this issue and the issue has not gotten the attention it deserves. This means there is still work to put pressure on our representatives for the next legislative session. When talking with legislators we learned that many of them are not only unaware of the facts of brain development in young people, but also that they had never heard stories of the kids who are directly impacted by these laws. </p>

<h3>Haygen &amp; Elaina: a brief his/herstory</h3>
<p>Oh wow, where to begin... It all started in the year of 2009 as two young, naive, presumably innocent freshman at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia. We met... didn't like each other... a semester passed... and then we fell in love. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FAST FORWARD!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh hey! I'm Elaina Di Monaco (and I'm Haygen Brice Walker!) and together we have formed ON THE ROCKS, a producing umbrella for our collaborative works. This is our #adulting theatre baby full of queer-wild-junkfood-popculture-millennial-magic. Haygen is the playwright. Elaina is the director. And we co-produce!</li>
<li>
<strong>Birdie's Pit Stop</strong> is our first full-length production as an official collective and we couldn't be more excited to share it with you. Both of us identify as queer millennials and are active theatre-makers. The more we advance, the more of a void we feel in the work we're seeing on stage. The voice of the queer millennial is not fully present on Philadelphia stages and we, as artists, consider it our mission to fix that. This piece is a love letter to our people!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>OUR NEEDS &amp; DONOR-KARMA!</h3>
<p>In order to make this production happen, we need money. We both have made personal contributions to the project (Fringe fees, insurance, so many props, etc) and have also made every effort to eliminate unnecessary purchases (living room rehearsals, borrowing, crafting). From this point forward, we're counting on you! </p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $1500! </li>
<li>That money will go directly to the following: Venue fees, scenery, props, costumes, marketing, fake blood and wigs! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE WHY</h3>
<p>As emerging theatre artists, we work around the clock to make our work, build our careers and pay our bills. We do this because we can't imagine doing anything else. We do it because we have stories to share. We do it because we have <u>something to say.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>This play is special. We are taking risks in the way we engage with audiences through this piece. We're challenging the status-quo of what makes good theatre. We're bringing new genres to the stage. Most importantly, we're putting queer millennials on the stage in a way that you probably haven't seen them before.  Yay queers! Yay millennials! Yay theatre!</li>
<li>We plan on blowing your minds with our queer-theatre-magic.  We want to blow your brains the way Beyonce blew the brains off the VMAS.  The way Ryan Lochte's abs blew the brains off of millions (why are they so hard?).  The way Rooney Mara blew the dragon tattoo off of the girl.</li>

Why? Because we all have bodies, we all have homes, and we’ve all had really trying experiences that we’ve had to come back from, heal, and return to some semblance of self.</p><p>After three years in California, countless dwellings I’ve called home, and one, singularly traumatic event that scared me out of my body, I’m reflecting on the following:</p><ul>
<li><i>What does it mean to recover somatically from a life-threatening experience?</i></li>
<li><i>How does the contrast of city and nature serve as a outer metaphorical context of our inner realities?</i></li>
</ul><p>Your support will make this project a reality, and enable us to travel back to my first home to perform this. We’ll be returning to my homeland of Jersey City, NJ to perform in <i>Your Move Modern Dance Festival,</i> a festival I envisioned and founded back in 2010.</p><p><strong><i>Coming Home</i> is a healing in and of itself</strong>, as well as a retrospective on what I have discovered in my search for home. I hope that anyone who has withstood trauma, or who has come up against similar questions will find a morsel of their own story in this piece.</p><h3> </h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p><strong><i>Dance is expensive to produce. </i></strong></p><p>Your Move Dance Festival is not able to pay artists performance fees, but they do take care of all printing, advertising, theater rental and technical staffing costs - so it's actually <i>way cheaper</i> for us to perform with them then to strike out on our own.</p><p>Your contribution pays for the bare-bones necessities: studio space, costumes, equipment, and our travel to the east coast from California.</p><p><strong>If we make our goal</strong>, we'll be able to fly Anthony out to perform, in his own way, with Odessa.</p><p><strong><i>Rather than just send Odessa along with a video that is played alongside the dance, our vision is to include improvisational interactive video alongside the dance, to create for an awe-inspiring, vivid and immediate experience. For this to happen, Anthony, our video artist, needs to be there in person.</i></strong></p><p>We’ll also be able to pay our artists for their time - we love doing our art, and we also believe that artists need to be compensated for their time because this is worthwhile and necessary work in the world!!</p><p><strong>If we make above and beyond our goal,</strong> we’ll be able to perform this in Nevada City and up and down the west coast.</p><p>Your perks include awesome art prints from Anthony, gifted healing sessions from Odessa, essential oil samples, and even a fitness package.

Because we all have bodies, we all have homes, and we’ve all had really trying experiences that we’ve had to come back from, heal, and return to some semblance of self.After three years in California, countless dwellings I’ve called home, and one, singularly traumatic event that scared me out of my body, I’m reflecting on the following:
What does it mean to recover somatically from a life-threatening experience?
How does the contrast of city and nature serve as a outer metaphorical context of our inner realities?
Your support will make this project a reality, and enable us to travel back to my first home to perform this. We’ll be returning to my homeland of Jersey City, NJ to perform in Your Move Modern Dance Festival, a festival I envisioned and founded back in 2010.Coming Home is a healing in and of itself, as well as a retrospective on what I have discovered in my search for home. I hope that anyone who has withstood trauma, or who has come up against similar questions will find a morsel of their own story in this piece. What We Need & What You GetDance is expensive to produce. Your Move Dance Festival is not able to pay artists performance fees, but they do take care of all printing, advertising, theater rental and technical staffing costs - so it's actually way cheaper for us to perform with them then to strike out on our own.Your contribution pays for the bare-bones necessities: studio space, costumes, equipment, and our travel to the east coast from California.If we make our goal, we'll be able to fly Anthony out to perform, in his own way, with Odessa.Rather than just send Odessa along with a video that is played alongside the dance, our vision is to include improvisational interactive video alongside the dance, to create for an awe-inspiring, vivid and immediate experience. For this to happen, Anthony, our video artist, needs to be there in person.We’ll also be able to pay our artists for their time - we love doing our art, and we also believe that artists need to be compensated for their time because this is worthwhile and necessary work in the world!!If we make above and beyond our goal, we’ll be able to perform this in Nevada City and up and down the west coast.Your perks include awesome art prints from Anthony, gifted healing sessions from Odessa, essential oil samples, and even a fitness package. Be an angel donor and receive allllll the perks. :) Who we are, and why we do what we do...OdessaAs always, I’m getting really personal with my work!

<p>This season Next Reflex Dance Collective brings their newest work ""The INtimate Window"" to the stage in several different performances.  This choreography is inspired by Michele Iverson's photographic series ""Night Surveillance"" and peers inside our intimate spaces and exposes our voyeuristic nature.  This project is a collaborative one between choreographer Roxann Morgan Rowley ,the dancers of NRDC and musician Mark Snyder.  The dancers will move in and out of a  10'X10' performance space where a projection from the ceiling will cast an environment on the floor for each intimate section. The choreography explores more closely the intimate settings from Iverson's photos entangling the audience in a web of relationships , solo gluttony and erotic fascination. </p>
