<p>After months of composing, tweaking, workshopping, writing and rewriting, SCOUTS is ready to take its next big step. This new musical about gender, inclusivity, and...a giant moth... has brought together an incredible team of actors, directors, designers, and creators to put together its first-ever full industry reading. </p>

<p>It’s the Summer of 1989, and in the small mountain town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, the rival troops of Brother Scouts and Sister Scouts are at <i>war</i>. Competing for the illustrious title of “Troop of the Year” awarded at the annual Scout Jamboree, the young Scouts only agree on one thing: their troop is better than the other.</p>
<p>Enter our two main characters: Alex, a brave, hotheaded, authority questioning Sister Scout, and Travis, the rule-following, loyal, friendly Brother Scout.

<h2>We are asking for $5,000 to recoup funds that we have given personally to get SCOUTS to New York City!</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we've invested our time, finances, and creative energy to make this show a reality. We have gathered an inspiring team, a glorious cast, and an amazing group of supporters and allies in shaping what we believe will be a truly revolutionary show, and the first step is a private industry reading happening on July 2nd, 2021, at Open Jar Studios, right off Times Square.</p>
<p>Every cent you donate will be used to cover artist pay, the creative team's involvement, and the final production costs that are making it all happen. Any additional funds will go directly into supporting the future development of SCOUTS into the future. Even if we don't reach our goal, every dollar raised will still be directed to cover those costs. SCOUTS is committed to, above all, supporting new work and its artists, and every cent helps.</p>
<p>And by supporting this cause, you join the troop! What's a scout without some badges? There are so many exciting perks that come with each donation amount: from thank yous, to unique, one-of-a-kind merchandise from the show, and even a seat to the private reading on July 2nd!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>As we begin our transition back to live performances, we believe we have an amazing opportunity to shape a new and different landscape for the performing arts. It's time for new types of shows for a new type of Broadway; and we think SCOUTS is just that. In line with that mission, we have partnered with the remarkable <strong>Con Limón Productions</strong>, a company committed to advocating for under-represented voices, developing vibrant new works by vibrant new writers, and supporting work with themes that sting, and a crisp and solid ""Why?"".  With their help, we have gathered an incredibly diverse and talented cast, director, music director, and designers, and your support can make sure they continue to get the recognition they deserve!</p>
<p>For us, this completely original story is what the world needs, right now. We need new, original content as theatre makers that is relatable to all audiences. We need to see stories that explore gender and sexuality. We need producers that prioritize equity and representation in casting and creative teams. </p>
<p>We all have experiences of feeling like we don't belong because of our gender, who we love, where we came from, or who we were meant to be. But this story changes that. <strong>We belong. We are loved. And we will always fight for a better world.</strong> <strong>And we want to invite you to fight for that world too. </strong></p>

<h2><strong>Creating new, ground-breaking work is hard. Creating new, ground-breaking work in this moment of transition is even harder.</strong></h2>
<p>SCOUTS has a tough, but exciting journey over this past year. We wrote the libretto, composed the full score, and achieved copyright. We created our website, social media platforms, and fundraisers to shape an online presence. We’ve hired incredible artists to record demos of select songs and participate in online readings. We even self-produced and archived an hour-long producer’s package presentation. And now, we're taking an even bigger step forward: our first full, live reading and sing-through of the whole musical. But it isn't easy: our ambition and dedication to creating a new process and artistic group towards the dream of a new and improved artistic has required a lot of financial and artistic effort, and a particular attention to increasing visibility, spreading the word, and creating a new brand, which is specially grueling in our current moment. We are in a key moment of transition, which has required us to adapt, re-adapt, and be always flexible and on our toes. </p>
<p>Luckily, we are so lucky to have assembled an incredible team that has risen up to the challenge. These artists were key players during the pandemic, creating opportunities and work for artists of all backgrounds, shapes, and talents. And as things begin to reopen, they are all promising to be even more important figures in shaping what the new artistic landscape of what New York City, and the world, can be.</p>
<p>We know it won't be easy, but we can promise you this: any support you give will be in good, capable, talented, and trustworthy hands. </p> <h2>Can't donate right now?<br/>You can still give us a hand!</h2>

<p>J.B. Waterman (Director, Producer) Brain Kavanaugh (Producer, Trigorin)  have had an obsession with the Seagull for quite awhile, mainly around it's unrealized comedy and it's apt-ness for our lives as actors in Los Angeles.  The characters in ""The Seagull"" are obsessed with Fame, and how it can (or can’t) make one happy.  Arkadina (an aging actress) returns to her estate, trying to hold on to her younger, more famous writer boyfriend.  Konstantin, (Arkadina’s son) has written a new, revolutionary kind of play that he believes will change the world and needs the approval of his mother and his girlfriend.  Konstantin’s girlfriend, Nina, dreams becoming a famous actress and how it will make her life unimaginably beautiful.  It goes on and on. Every character exists in Los Angeles today and is comically self-involved!</p>
<p>The Seagull shows us farcical versions of ourselves, and invites us to both laugh at and feel compassion towards them.  </p>
<p>Taking this show from thrilling idea to fully realized production has been a monumental and expensive task.  We’ve had to rent a theatre, pay for the rights to the translation (Paul Shmidt’s hilarious work), hire a set designer, a lighting designer, a costume designer, sound designer and a stage manager.  We are also offering our actors a small stipend for their weeks and weeks of inspired work.  This is a serious undertaking, and we’ve had to go deep into the hole to marshall the resources to begin.  </p>
<p>$6000 will not cover the cost of production, not even close, but it should allow us to break even after ticket sales.    </p>
<p>J.B. and Brian have brought Alex Elliott-Funk (playing Dorn) in to help produce this show.  All Three are veterans of over 70 theatrical productions.  J.B. has produced and directed five plays and acted in over 30,  Brian has acted in over 15 productions and Alex has either produced or acted in over 30 plays.  We know what it takes to make a show entertaining and meaningful.  But most importantly, we are passionately committed to making this play, one that changes people’s perspective on Chekhov. </p>

</div><p></p></div>","What is Poetic License?Poetic Theater Productions is raising funds for Poetic License, our fifth annual festival of new poetic theater, which will take place March 16-April 10, 2016 at Wild Project in NYC's East Village.  Poetic Theater Productions is a community driven organization and Poetic License is both a space and stage to celebrate and give a platform to the diverse voices and breadth of experience found within New York City. Poetic License features full-length plays, devised theater, developmental and new play readings and special events that highlight themes including love, war, mental health, identity and politics from a diverse array of social and cultural backgrounds. We need your help to raise the final $10,000 to make this festival happen. Please watch the video and share this page via Facebook, Twitter and email to friends and individuals who you feel would like to support social justice through art, poetry and theater.Why should you support us?Poetic Theater Productions and our annual Poetic License festival have become essential spaces for some of New York's most talented artists to develop and premiere new powerful works of poetic theater telling their stories and giving needed artistic voice to today's social justice movements.  Your support helps us continue to offer and build this artistic space and make more powerful and immediate poetic theater.  Producing theater in New York is expensive - especially while trying to make our art accessible to a diverse community of different fiscal means by keeping ticket prices at an affordable rate.  That means ticket sales only cover a portion of our full production costs.  This is why your donations are so important.  We literally can't do this festival without your support.What do we need money for?
Four week theater rental in the East Village
Our wonderful production team (production manager, festival lighting & video designer, audio engineer and stage managers) to help us run the theater throughout the month-long festival. 
A producer and an associate producer to help us coordinate all of the artists & performances, marketing and production for the festival
Our actors, directors, playwrights and designers
Travel stipends for our interns who help run everything from our front of house, to our marketing, to the shows themselves
Marketing and Outreach to get the word out about all of the incredible shows and a coordinator to enhance those efforts
Rehearsal & workshop space for the various shows in the weeks leading up to the festival
Program printing for 28 shows

The Festival Line-Up
This year's festival will include...


Devised Poetic Theater

<h3>Why This? Why Now?</h3>
<p>Aging women often feel ignored or marginalized by the world, despite the stories and wisdom and laughter we have to share. Developing our play <i>""Dancing With Crow's Feet©""</i> allowed us to collect stories from women whose voices aren't often heard including women in nursing homes and community centers.</p>
<p>This work is groundbreaking - no one else is sharing aging women's stories in this way. We see this as an important way to honor aging women and dispel myths and stereotypes about aging. The play is meant to raise awareness about ageism.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We premiered ""Dancing With Crow's Feet"" at the 2016 KC Fringe Festival, where we won 'Best of Show' for our venue. <strong>Now, we have the opportunity to take our show to a much bigger and more important stage - the IAGG World Congress of Gerontology and Geriatrics in San Francisco. </strong>This event only occurs every four years and hasn't been in the U. S. in decades. The focus is <strong><i>Global Aging and Health: Bridging Science, Policy, and Practice</i></strong> and addresses the latest approaches to improving the quality of life of the world's older adults. This is our chance to share real women's stories and experiences with an audience of influential aging professionals.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to take a core cast of six to San Francisco. Our budget includes:</p>
<p>Round-trip air fare for six cast members = $535 x 6 = $3,210</p>
<p>Cost of transportation in San Francisco (airport to hotel / hotel to conference site) = $620</p>
<p>Hotel accommodations for six cast members = $320 (per room) x 4 rooms x 4 nights = $5,120</p>
<p>Food for Cast - 25 x 6 x 4 = $600</p>
<p>TOTAL = $9,550</p>
<p><strong>What do you get?</strong> Besides knowing that <u>YOU are part of the creative aging movement</u>, you will also be supporting a groundbreaking project that combats ageism.  At various levels of sponsorship, you will hear directly from members of the cast and might even get to meet them in person, so that you can enjoy their wit and wisdom for yourself.</p>
<p>We are determined to meet our goal of taking the  core cast of six to perform at the <i><b>Global Aging and Health Conference.  </b></i>Should we miss our goal, we will use the funds to send as many cast members as we can and to support the performances of this show in the Kansas City area.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this play, we're sharing stories that beg to be heard, from women whose stories are often missed. Already, ""Dancing with Crow's Feet©"" has made an impact by challenging expectations about women and aging for cast/crew and audience members alike.</p>
<p><strong>Just imagine what it will be like to take these stories and this experience to the people who have major influence in the world of aging!</strong> Perhaps more than anyone else, the people attending the IAGG World Congress of Gerontology and Geriatrics need to understand the impact of ageism on women, and they need to see the beautiful, witty, poignant work of art that we have created together.</p>
<p>Many of these aging experts will never come to Kansas City to see our play, but at the IAGG conference, we will be able to bring our message to over 6,000 influential professionals who can then  take it back home to their universities and hospitals and their communities across the world.</p>

</div>When we were kids, we loved Roald Dahl.  His books were macabre and 
funny and weird and sweet, all at the same time.  At the time, we didn't
 know anything about the man behind the books.  Writing is a solitary 
pursuit, which makes the lives of writers often rather dull.  Not so 
with Roald!  When we discovered his early life as a fighter pilot, spy, 
and propaganda author, we knew we'd found the raw materials for a play. 
 One detail that especially stuck out to us was the affair he had had 
with sitting Congresswoman, Clare Luce.  The more we learned about 
Clare, the more we knew their relationship would be the centerpiece of 
the play.  Clare was a playwright whose work had been wildly successful 
on Broadway, a journalist who traveled to the front lines of World War 
Two, and a politician who never compromised her fierce intelligence for 
party loyalty.  And yet, even after all of that, she still endured 
sexist jokes by men who assumed she had slept her way to the top.  Her 
story is obviously relevant to our current political climate while being
 fascinating in its own right.  The play that we wrote is now less a 
literary biography and more a sex comedy trapped in a spy thriller.  
It's a story of love, lies, and children's books from Blythe Roberson 
and Andy Boyd.<br/><br/>We hope that you will help our production by donating to our fund, and in doing so support a group of passionate, enthusiastic, and devoted writers, actors, producers, and designers.

<p>O.REX is a brand new translation of <strong>Sophocles' Oedipus Rex</strong>, re-envisioned as a <strong>Greek-Noir Classic</strong>. <em>(Greek-Noir: a mash-up of Greek Tragedy &amp; American Film Noir.)</em> Translated from the Original Greek by <strong>Classics' Scholar Mark Buchan and Gia Forakis</strong>, this production will take place in a nightclub. The audience will be seated at the nightclub tables, where Sophocles' Choral Odes become acts on the nightclub stage, as the entire performance space is transformed into<strong> a black &amp; white world of 1940-50’s film noir</strong> with cinematic underscoring, video projection and the gripping drama of <strong>the ultimate murder mystery!</strong>    <br/></p>
<h3>What's Next for O.REX?</h3>
<p>With our new script in place, now <strong>IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE MUSIC!</strong>    </p>
<p>This August, GF&amp;CO was invited to <strong>The Putney School in Putney Vermont</strong>, for a Residency with our <strong>Grammy-Award Winning Composer, Jeremy Mage</strong>, and the O.Rex creative team to begin work on the <b>five jazz-ballad Choral Odes-Night Club Songs</b>.

O.REX is a brand new translation of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, re-envisioned as a Greek-Noir Classic. (Greek-Noir: a mash-up of Greek Tragedy & American Film Noir.) Translated from the Original Greek by Classics' Scholar Mark Buchan and Gia Forakis, this production will take place in a nightclub. The audience will be seated at the nightclub tables, where Sophocles' Choral Odes become acts on the nightclub stage, as the entire performance space is transformed into a black & white world of 1940-50’s film noir with cinematic underscoring, video projection and the gripping drama of the ultimate murder mystery!    
What's Next for O.REX?
With our new script in place, now IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE MUSIC!    
This August, GF&CO was invited to The Putney School in Putney Vermont, for a Residency with our Grammy-Award Winning Composer, Jeremy Mage, and the O.Rex creative team to begin work on the five jazz-ballad Choral Odes-Night Club Songs. Here is a SNEAK PEEK of the work we've done so far!:
(Music: Jeremy Mage, Lyrics: Mark Buchan, Residency Participants: Maria Deasy, Katrina Foy, Randolph Curtis Rand, Stephanie Regina)

What is Your Role in O.REX?
Your contributions will play an essential role in the REALIZATION OF THE MUSIC, bringing us one step closer to our Fall 2014 production of O.REX. Here is how your generous contributions will play out...
$429 pays for composing, producing & recording of one Choral Ode-Nightclub Song
$2,144 pays for producing & recording of all Choral Odes-Nightclub Songs
$4,288 pays for composing, producing & recording of the Cinematic Underscore
$6,432 pays for all of the above
$12,432 pays for all of the above plus the Composer's Fee
$Overfunding will not go to waste!
Every extra penny will be applied to the production budget for the Fall 2014 Production

<h2>GRUESOME PLAYGROUND INJURIES</h2>
<h3>JUNE 27-JULY 1, 2018—San Diego, CA</h3>
<ul></ul>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<ul><li>
<i>Gruesome Playground Injuries</i>, follows childhood friends, Doug and Kayleen over the course of 30 years, from ages 8 to 38, as their lives intersect and they compare emotional and physical scars. </li></ul>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<ul><li>After a relentless pursuit for the rights for <i>Gruesome Playground Injuries</i>, a play by Rajiv Joseph, we were finally able to obtain them for San Diego, and will be mounting the play June 27-July 1st. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Allowing us to tell this story, may not solve world peace or hunger, but I do believe it’s beauty, and searing truth around what it is to carry both emotional and physical wounds into relationships, will definitely leave a mark you’ll not soon forget.  And ultimately I feel like that’s something of value to take out into the world—an understanding that scars come in all shapes and sizes, and perhaps if we share with each other, how we ache, hurt, and bleed, and do so openly, we just might see each other more clearly. Okay, so maybe it is about world peace. </li></ul>

Shortly after graduating from USC, Victoria's life shifted when her childhood best friend committed suicide. After the 2014 passing of her friend, she knew she needed to tell the story of her friend and the thousand others who struggle with depression. Her critically praised short film, ""Dear Harley,"" premiered at multiple film festivals across the world, bringing more light to these issues and opening up much needed conversations on mental health.<br/>Victoria continues to expand her awareness around such topics, exploring also themes of grief, loss, addictions, and human intimacy and connection. She is currently studying at The Imagined Life Studio under the care of Diana Castle and Faline England.</p>
<p><i>A note from Victoria:</i> I have been chasing down this play since 2014, and am so beyond excited and pumped to finally share this story, in all it's gruesome glory! I think there's something so beautifully painful about this story and yet brutally honest in that pain and beauty, scars and healing are very rarely experienced separately—where one starts, another one usually begins.  </p>
<p>A special thank you to Jared, Darius, Rals, and Susan for saying yes to this journey—getting to do this with some of my best friends is the most wonderful and joyous thing!  And thank you Faline England for lending arms, voice, poetry, and belief—immensely grateful for your guidance always! And thank you Diana Castle for the gift of The Imagined Life, and to all the insanely wild hearts I've grown to know and love within that space. </p>

JUNE 27-JULY 1, 2018—San Diego, CA

The Story

Gruesome Playground Injuries, follows childhood friends, Doug and Kayleen over the course of 30 years, from ages 8 to 38, as their lives intersect and they compare emotional and physical scars. 
Mission
After a relentless pursuit for the rights for Gruesome Playground Injuries, a play by Rajiv Joseph, we were finally able to obtain them for San Diego, and will be mounting the play June 27-July 1st. 
Allowing us to tell this story, may not solve world peace or hunger, but I do believe it’s beauty, and searing truth around what it is to carry both emotional and physical wounds into relationships, will definitely leave a mark you’ll not soon forget.  And ultimately I feel like that’s something of value to take out into the world—an understanding that scars come in all shapes and sizes, and perhaps if we share with each other, how we ache, hurt, and bleed, and do so openly, we just might see each other more clearly. Okay, so maybe it is about world peace.

Is the Young Woman who keeps coming through forgetful, or something more? Is the Raven talking when we know it doesn’t know how? What’s in the back room? And, where is the bartender? One incredible meeting between two literary greats in their prime, slowly becomes a fantastical, dark, and comedic adventure of what’s real and what isn’t, that would change the course of their lives forever.Is this a true story?Yes and no.

<p>My name is Paul Overton and I run a mid-sized performing arts center in Hardwick, Massachusetts. One of my missions in life has always been to promote creativity in any way I can and to give a voice to the voiceless when that opportunity arises. This summer, just such an opportunity will be happening right here in Central Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In July, a phenomenal dance group called PUSH Physical Theater, from Rochester, NY will spend three weeks here at our campus, developing a new performance piece with at-risk teens from the area. This is a ""first of its kind"" residency that I sincerely hope will become an annual event, providing a forum for local youth to tell their stories through dance.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to pull off this feat, we need to raise $12,500 to provide food, lodging, and stipends to the company as well as scholarships for the kids involved.</p>
<p>Being that this is an experiential project and not focused on creating a tangible product like a book or CD, contributors can expect to get frequent updates, rehearsal diaries, and scenes from the final performance. Higher level contributors will also receive tickets to the final performance in Hardwick, MA.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>During my time in this rural and economically challenged area, I've had the opportunity to connect with some of our local kids through our Youth Center. In listening to their stories, one thing is abundantly clear...they have very few opportunities for creativity or self-expression. They also have a generally dim view of the future. They are not aware of the possibilities that a creative life has to offer and have never had the luxury of studying art, music, or dance, outside of their overcrowded and underfunded classrooms.</p>
<p>This residency will, on a small scale, provide the opportunity to experience what it's like to create something as a team and to simultaneously express oneself through a particular type of physical storytelling. Through trust, partnering, and commitment to the process, students will emerge with a new sense of worth and possibility by the end of the project...and who could ask for more?</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute monetarily, please consider passing this page around to your friends and acquaintances through facebook, twitter, or any other outlets you see fit. Thank you for any help!</p></div>","The Short Story

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Rhys MT, and when I was 8yrs old -
everything in the world was Multicoloured. I truly believed that there was a place called Multicoloured Land where below the surface of
anything - was a million and one different colours. If I saw a
rabbit, a house, a car, a man, a woman in fact anything I could dream of I saw in Multicolours
 
Then when I was 12, a teacher pointed out that
there were only three prime colours in the world, and all the colours were made
up of these, so my dreams of Multicolours shattered into a million different
pieces
 
My childhood ended then
 
Now I'm trying to get the Colour back, and to reawaken Multicolured Land in the world through the story - Colour Bleed
 
Colour Bleed is a 3 part transmedia story that
combines dance with a well crafted script and spans Film, ARG, Social Media,
Graphic Novels and Live Performances to create an enthralling, exciting, mind
blowing experience. 
It's the story of two people trying to dance the colour
back into the terrible evil of a grey world 
 
The Impact
I want
to bring colour back into everyones lives. We're all struggling to live through
the financial depression plaguing our world - I want to give the world a moment
to escape into the joy of experiencing in Multicolour Land! 

What We Need & What You Get

In
this campaign, we are trying to raise money to create the first stage of Colour
Bleed
 
This
first stage will be three fold -  



To shoot a short film that tells the story of a dance battle to bring the sparks of colour back to Multicolour Land
To create a live dance performances - of colour battles, to be taken around nightclubs and youth centres around Wales (which will be filmed and spread through the online social sphere)
To create a short Graphic Novel that tells the story of the colour crystal - that powers Multicolour Land



For
the short film, we have already secured the services of Dawns TAN the largest
community dance organisation in Wales, alongside a highly experienced
choreographer, and will be funding their involvement ourselves
 
We
need to raise funds to shoot the short film (locations, equipment, transport,
food) and to this end we are looking for $3000 to fund this strand
 
For the
live dance performances, as above, we have secured the services of Dawns TAN -
the largest community dance organisation in Wales, alongside a highly
experienced choreographer. We will be funding the filming of these performances
ourselves
 
For
the rehearsal costs, transport, venue hire, food and equipment - we are looking
for $2000
 
For
the short graphic novel, we are already in discussions with several up and
coming graphic artists, and are looking for $2000 to fund this part
 
The
overall goal for stage 1 is $7000
 
As
this is a dream to bring the colour back into the world - if we don't reach the
goal, we will use any funds raised to shoot short colour dance films, using
mobile phones, to begin spreading the idea of colour throughout the social
online sphere. we will also use any funds available to create taster colour
dance battles in various live venues around Wales

Further stages for the project include an ARG - where players will try to gain access to the Grey Lands nerve centre - culminating in a live performance streamed across the web

There will also be a series of Interactive Films (where the viewer will be given the opportunity to follow the story of their own chosen character, alongside playing that character in an online game set in Multicolour Land)

There will also be a Pervasive Game - for players to experience anywhere in the World

Further plans include iPad apps, console dance mat games and a large scale worldwide participatory Multicoloured Dance performance in venues across the world & streamed online

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Hannah Taylor-Kormondy and I am the owner of South Sound Dance in Tumwater, Washington. We are a local small business and opened our dance studio just five years ago. Starting with just 21 students, 1 studio room and 2 teachers, we have grown to 250 students, 2 studios, and a staff of 9 and we are quickly running out of space!  Our hallways are crowded, parking is terrible, and our current location is beginning to attract homeless and substance abuse users which is creating a dangerous environment for our students. While the business is running well and growing every year we simply do not have the capital to fund a new commercial build out to meet our needs. Commercial building costs are extremely high which is why many small business owners cannot own or build their own space and why we see more and more corporate businesses throughout our community.  City project and planning costs as well as permits can easily run a small business owner upward of 100K just to get a project started.  That is where we need your help!</p>
<p>We have found an existing 6,000 sq. foot facility that can meet the needs of our dance studio, and it is my intention to build and create a new, creative, and safe space for students, families, and the community! In order to purchase and renovate the building we are campaigning to raise $50,000 or more! This money will not only help to begin our project, but it will serve our community by supporting local small business, providing a safe after school performing arts center for students in the area, and will bring performing arts and arts education to the forefront of Tumwater and South Sound communities. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help turn my dream of creating a performing arts center for Tumwater into a reality - offering more dance and movement classes, theater, and vocal lessons all under one roof to both children and adults.  It will create a safe space for children to go after school to develop their minds and bodies with artistic and kin-esthetic awareness and will help connect people with each other directly instead of through screens.  These kids absolutely need safe creative spaces like our dance studio especially with the loss of arts funding from public schools.  <br/><br/>Your donation can help a child find their passion, find a voice, and find a connection!  Your donation can help a student go to college with a scholarship! Your donation can create healthy body awareness for an adult! Your donation can change our community so please consider the below! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here it is guys.... broken down for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>In order to buy the building and have enough for a build out I will need a loan of $600,000.  A down payment for such a loan with the help of the SBA will be $60,000. The remainder of the loan will be paid off in monthly payments that will cost roughly the same as my existing rent! But we will have double the space! Crazy! Which means more class offerings, more jobs, more smiling faces in our building every day... you see it, right?!</li>
<li>Perks for donating!<ul>
<li> Give any amount and get a button as a contributing member! </li>
<li> Give over $50, the above and you will be entered into a raffle to win an SSD SWAG item of your choice! </li>
<li> Give over $100, all of the above and yours or your child's hand print will go on a piece of artwork for the new studio! </li>
<li> Give over $200, all of the above and a free 30 minute private lesson with me the owner! (Businesses that give at this level will receive advertisement on our TV monitors in the new building for 3 months)</li>
<li> Give over $500+, all of the above and yours or your child's name etched in the new building (Businesses that give at this level will receive advertisement on our TV monitors in the new building for 6 months).</li>
<li>$1000+, all of the above with and special mention on our website and social media, printed programs, and at the annual Holiday Show and Spring Recital (Business will receive advertisement on our TV monitors for a full year).</li>

<li>""Thank you for your support...I was able to audition for several schools and decided upon Colorado Mesa as a Dance Major! When you support the arts, you also help dancers like me follow their dreams. With deep appreciation, Lindy Lyon.""</li>
<li>""We've been so happy to have found South Sound Dance and become part of the community here. Each dancer feels like they are a personal project of the studio... so positive, giving, and supportive of each other. We couldn't have asked for a better experience for Emma."" - Wyatt Ehrlander</li>
<li>""There are classes for everyone and whether you have aspirations to be a professional dancer or are totally new to dance, you'll be welcomed with open arms."" - Amy Briggs</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a risk that we will not meet this goal and that it will take longer for our business to move into a new location. However, with our growth rate and our business strategies I know we will find the right building and be able to make a move in the next few years if this building does not work out. This money no matter what will contribute to a new dance space for the Tumwater community. And if we don't raise the total funds needed at this time we will continue to raise money to reach our goal!</p>

two exceptionally imaginative twins have been left home alone in Charleston
while their parents vacation across continents, the Devil comes to town, having
made a bet with one of Hell’s denizens on the existence of free human will, and
as a result this delicate home is irremediably changed…</p>
<p><b>The Premier of Od is
MFA Candidate Hannah Bisewski’s first very FULL-LENGTH production at Columbia
University, directed by Peter Petkovšek and produced by Shiva Kalaiselvan. </b></p>
<p><b>Why the ‘Od’
Statement?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To Hannah, this play is about the intersection of several
entangled issues that are all characteristically American. It is a contemporary
take on the Southern Gothic genre, from which she hopes to draw the timelessness
of many of its preoccupations --isolation, the compulsive preservation of
history, and a nostalgia for abandoned causes. 
It’s about asking the biggest conceivable questions when broaching
issues of history and our moral accountability -- how much do we forgive the
errors of our forefathers, and when can we consider ourselves cleansed?  And in a god-less world, how do we determine
the truth in our own answers?  The
navigation of these questions is as disorienting as the experience of the show
itself.</span></p>
<p><b><br/>Why Od needs You?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our Goal is to raise $2,500 by March 15</span><sup>th</sup><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, 2014,

When
two exceptionally imaginative twins have been left home alone in Charleston
while their parents vacation across continents, the Devil comes to town, having
made a bet with one of Hell’s denizens on the existence of free human will, and
as a result this delicate home is irremediably changed…
The Premier of Od is
MFA Candidate Hannah Bisewski’s first very FULL-LENGTH production at Columbia
University, directed by Peter Petkovšek and produced by Shiva Kalaiselvan. 
Why the ‘Od’
Statement?To Hannah, this play is about the intersection of several
entangled issues that are all characteristically American. It is a contemporary
take on the Southern Gothic genre, from which she hopes to draw the timelessness
of many of its preoccupations --isolation, the compulsive preservation of
history, and a nostalgia for abandoned causes. 
It’s about asking the biggest conceivable questions when broaching
issues of history and our moral accountability -- how much do we forgive the
errors of our forefathers, and when can we consider ourselves cleansed?  And in a god-less world, how do we determine
the truth in our own answers?  The
navigation of these questions is as disorienting as the experience of the show
itself.
Why Od needs You?Our Goal is to raise $2,500 by March 15th, 2014,
which will be the last day of our final performance of our run -- which we will
be presenting free to the public.  And
although Columbia University will be hosting the project, the production team
is still in need of financial support to ensure that this project is designed
and executed to the highest level possible. To give you an idea of where your
money is going, here is an example of our preliminary budget.

<h3>What Is Chuckle Duster?</h3>
<p>We're an improv comedy show resident for over a year in Bar Kick in Shoreditch, London. We make things up on the spot based upon your suggestions, and essentially that makes us your toys. Have a look at some of our past shows: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ChuckleDusterComedy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/ChuckleDusterComedy</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Do We Need Your Money?</h3>
<p>Let's be honest here, the show is going ahead whatever happens. We're just literally trying to have some fun with a quirky internet presence that happens to be a simple way of selling some tickets in advance! Yes we admit, this is basically an easy way of selling tickets online. Actual costs of running the show are quite low; £88.40 in transport for the cast, if you want to get specific, but Indiegogo sets a minimum amount of £500. We don't need to make that much at all, and frankly, we should be fine to reach £88.40 with door sales, but hey... this was an opportunity to offer some extra crazy perks for your amusement, let people know about our new show, and give our fans a weird way of helping to market it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Essentially, the simplest perk, and the one that makes sense is buying a ticket online here, ready to see the show on the 4th June.</p>
<p>Want a permanent video stream of the show, well that's available for a little extra, and a valuable purchase for those that can't make it to see the show, but want the full experience. Normally we release the odd game online from each of our shows, <span>but for the first time (and possibly the only time...ever)</span>, you will be able to purchase an entire show from start to finish (barring technical glitches) and enjoy it for ever more.</p>
<p>We will improvise/write a song for you, either in the show, or separately, depending on your wishes.</p>
<p>Lauren's bra. Nuff said.</p>
<p>Oh, and she will even give you a five minute skype call, TOTALLY NAKED. N.B. we promise she will be naked, but it is unlikely that she will frame the camera much below her neckline.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Come along to the show. Tell people about the show. Go on then!</p>

<p>The plays of Martin McDonagh have been simultaneously lauded and questioned by critics and audiences alike.  It is fitting, then, that ""The Pillowman"" presents us with multiple dualities:  Two brothers, two detectives, two sets of two rooms (one in the present and one in the past.)  Both McDonagh and Katurian Katurian (himself a double in name) handle the brutal content of their writing with a dark sense of humor, which raises several important questions:  Does violence in art awaken our own sense of humanity, or does it desensitize us as violence becomes more and more de rigueur?  Can compassion and humanity exist without brutality and unfeeling violence?  Can the creative process be regulated?  What are the responsibilities of artists as they seek to make sense of a chaotic and seemingly unfeeling world?  How does one's imagination align with the greater good--is it the responsibility of the government to say so?  McDonagh's play tackles these difficult themes with reckless abandon.<br/></p>
<p>Having won the 2004 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play as well as being nominated for the 2005 Tony Award for Best Play, ""The Pillowman"" stands as one of Martin McDonagh's finest plays too date.

<h2>Ekaabo Orixas! What's that?</h2>
<p><strong>Ekaabo Orixas!</strong> is a multidisciplinary show with dance, music and story-telling for kids and families. It is a show about the <em>Orixas, </em> Afro-Brazilian divinities. It features, 3 dancers, 1 singer/narrator and 2 musicians.</p>
<p>We LOVE stories, which is why we digged into Afro-Brazilian ancestral legends to write a show and an audiobook. We use traditional myths that are still relevant today, using 4 strong and evocative <em>Orixas</em> representing the 4 elements of nature.</p>
<p>Ekaabo Orixas! will premiere <strong>on October 27th at Theater Calixa-Lavallée in Montreal</strong>, QC, Canada.</p>
<h3>Goals of our show and audiobook</h3>
<p>Through Ekaabo Orixas!, we deliver environmental and social messages because we believe that while being entertained, kid's imagination need to be exposed to different sets of values. Ones that offer role models different than the usual and which do not reflect the variety and range of beauties, strengths the world offers. Ekaabo Orixas! offers all colors! </p>
<h3>The plot</h3>
<p>Confronted with questions about the color of his skin, a child asks his grandma about their origins. She tells him she was brought here on a slave ship from West Africa, and that what kept her going was her belief in the wonderful Orixas. From this very point, she takes him into the colorful and thrilling story of 4 Orixas: <em>Iemanja, Oxum, Oxossi</em> and <em>Xango</em>.</p>
<p>With tales of the creation of the world, bravour, love, fight, happiness and sorrow, kids and families will dive into this enchanted world full of messages of tolerance, acceptance and openness towards other cultures.</p>
<h2>Meet our team</h2>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>to <strong>pay the awesome artists</strong> who will work full time on this production</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>take the show on tour</strong></li>
<li><strong>publish the audiobook</strong></li>
</ol><p>Which is why the Premiere has to be produced in the best possible conditions, especially because VIPs are going to be there. :-)</p>

Ekaabo Orixas! is a multidisciplinary show with dance, music and story-telling for kids and families. It is a show about the Orixas,  Afro-Brazilian divinities. It features, 3 dancers, 1 singer/narrator and 2 musicians.
We LOVE stories, which is why we digged into Afro-Brazilian ancestral legends to write a show and an audiobook. We use traditional myths that are still relevant today, using 4 strong and evocative Orixas representing the 4 elements of nature.
Ekaabo Orixas! will premiere on October 27th at Theater Calixa-Lavallée in Montreal, QC, Canada.
Goals of our show and audiobook
Through Ekaabo Orixas!, we deliver environmental and social messages because we believe that while being entertained, kid's imagination need to be exposed to different sets of values. Ones that offer role models different than the usual and which do not reflect the variety and range of beauties, strengths the world offers. Ekaabo Orixas! offers all colors! 
The plot
Confronted with questions about the color of his skin, a child asks his grandma about their origins. She tells him she was brought here on a slave ship from West Africa, and that what kept her going was her belief in the wonderful Orixas. From this very point, she takes him into the colorful and thrilling story of 4 Orixas: Iemanja, Oxum, Oxossi and Xango.
With tales of the creation of the world, bravour, love, fight, happiness and sorrow, kids and families will dive into this enchanted world full of messages of tolerance, acceptance and openness towards other cultures.
Meet our team


Maria Isabel Rondon - Choreographer/dancer/scriptwriter. She has studied the dance of the Orixas in Brasil for 3 years. She is the acclaimed choreographer of the show Barravento, who won some prizes in Québec.




Chrystelle Maechler - Narrator/singer/scriptwriter/composer. Singer/songwriter of bands SOA and ORANGE KITCHEN, narrator of audiobooks for the blinds you can find at the National Library of Quebec and writes columns for an online jazz magazine.



Samito Matsinhe - Soundtrack and Engineer. A graduate from Schulic School of Music, Samito is also the keyboard player for Radio Radio.He is currently recording his first full-length album, due to be released in the spring of 2013.



Clea Minaker - Scenography. For reference, she is the one who did the scenography for international artist FEIST.



Akawui Riquelme - Composer /Musician. A multi-instrumentist and percussionist with extensive knowledge of South-American music.



Myriam Farger - Dancer. A talented dancer specialized in oriental and Brazilian dance.

Why did we come together?
We have all been fans of each other's work for years. We now decided to unite our voices and art forms to deliver a messages of an openness we believe in, using this magical world. Manner targetted, because we want to believe in a more tolerant tomorrow.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $5000 to produce the Premiere of the show and an audiobook. More specifically, the funding will be used:


to rent the theater one week before the show (rehearsals)


to pay the awesome artists who will work full time on this production


to pay a lighting technician for the final rehearsals and show


to produce and print a 150 copies of the audiobook

Why not look at the great perks we offer and become part of both the show and the audiobook history by helping us make this a reality. In doing so you also  enable independent artists to take their rightful place in the Quebec's cultural landscape.
Why should you contribute?
This project is major for our respective careers. For each one of us this is the epitomy of what we have been doing for years. Years of experience, artistry, beliefs and hopes united in ONE show, ONE audiobook.
Plans for the future
Ekaabo Orixas! is not a one-shot deal. We plan:

take the show on tour
publish the audiobook
Which is why the Premiere has to be produced in the best possible conditions, especially because VIPs are going to be there. :-)
There are so many ways to support the project!
Even if you think you can't help, you sure can. Not contributing financially doesn't mean you can't contribute. There are many easy ways to do so:

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Hi. Bonjour. Mike and Lacy here to say, thank you for visiting our indiegogo page for...</p>
<p><strong>""My Favorite Podcast (the unofficial MFM musical)""</strong><br/><i>Book, Music, and Lyrics by: Michael Perrie Jr<br/>Directed by: Lacy Reily</i></p>
<p>Let us tell you a little bit about the project!</p>
<p>2 years ago, Mike was sitting in the back of the bar with his good friend Mika and they were talking about making podcasts into musicals. Months later the idea wouldn't leave his head, and he began writing a song inspired by his favorite podcast, <a href=""https://myfavoritemurder.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MY FAVORITE MURDER</a> by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. Their podcast shifted his ideals about friendship, addiction, therapy and  created a diverse and incredible community of supportive like minded people which inspired Mike to take that <strong>one song</strong> <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mikeperrie/1-ssdgm-rough-demo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(which you can hear a demo of here)</a> and then write several more songs! Soon they became a script and lo and behold a year and a half later, he had 10 songs and a rough draft!</p>
<p>It was then that he submitted the rough, unfinished draft to <a href=""https://www.virtualvenuetheatricals.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virtual Venue Theatricals </a> a womxn run digital theatre company who thought it was groundbreaking musical theatre and wanted to produce a workshop and fully realized digital production of the show in 2021.</p>
<p>Now we're in 2021 and that's when Lacy is officially brought on board to direct and develop. Not only is Lacy a brilliant director of new plays, she's also Mike's incredibly awesome wife! Both Mike and Lacy listen to MFM together on a regular basis, and after reading their book ""Stay Sexy and Don't Get Murdered"" the two agreed that this show needed to see the light of  day! Together they have worked on over 20 new scripts and shows together...and ""My Favorite Podcast"" will be our crowning quarantine achievement!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need...</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Unfortunately, it's been a very difficult time for theatre artists. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the majority of us are out of a job for the foreseeable future...</p>
<p>The producing company is a non-profit working very hard for very little, and all of that goes into the production. Which means that the whole team is working from passion and not for money. So the actors, designers, and other artists involved wouldn't be able to get paid for their hard work. That's when, Lacy and I decided that we needed to do a fundraiser to make sure everyone involved gets SOMETHING for working with us on this project. The theatre community is a community - and we need to raise each other up the best we can.</p>
<p>So we're trying to raise $3500 to make sure no one on the team is working for free.</p>

<p>ABOUT</p>
<p>Based out of the Kore Dance Studio in Edmonton, Alberta, Cool Giraffes is a professional dance company that was originated as a dance project founded by Randall Mella in the summer of 2016. The project was developed by Randall to showcase his craft as a choreographer in the competitive circuit as well as to dance and have fun with his group of friends. In the past three years- the team debuted at World of Dance Edmonton, garnered tremendous support by the local dance community, competed across Canada, and has grown to over 35+ members and alumni.  </p>
<p>The team has transitioned into a hip hop company consisting of 28 members who come from different walks of life and range between the ages of 11 to 26. Current directors, Randall Mella and Thomas Boivin, ensure that with dance comes a strong foundation of friendship and hard work. With these values, we are consistently inspired and encouraged to support one another to strive to be the best we can be as dancers and people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>CURRENTLY</p>
<p>It has been an exciting year as the team received first place at HHI Canadian Championships in Montreal in June making Cool Giraffes the top megacrew in Canada.  We are excited to represent our country on the world stage for HHI World Championships in Phoenix this August.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>HELP OUT SOME COOL GIRAFFES</p>
<p>To get to the world stage, each member is funding themselves individually and the costs of getting to Hip Hop International has taken a financial strain on each member. To support this trip, any amount helps and we are so incredibly thankful for your support in our journey to compete and represent our country at Hip Hop International World Championship 2019!</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Drama Desk Winner Godlight Theatre Company
celebrates its 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary at 59E59 Theaters this fall with the world
premiere adaptation of James Dickey’s novel, <b>DELIVERANCE</b>. A heart stopping tour
de force, a mildly adventurous canoe trip explodes into a nightmare of horror
and murder. Men stalk and are stalked by other men and the treacherous river
becomes a graveyard for those without the strength or the luck to survive. </p>
<p>Adapted for the stage, for the first time ever by Sean Tyler, and directed by Joe Tantalo, <b>DELIVERANCE</b> features long time acting company members Gregory Konow, Nick Paglino, and Bryce Hodgson, with a design team that includes lighting design by Maruti Evans (Drama Desk Winner), sound design by Ien DeNio (Drama Desk nominee), and costume design by Orli Nativ.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT</h3>
<div></div>
</div>
<p></p> <div> <h3>
</h3>
<p>This campaign is so important because it will provide us essential working capital to bring James Dickey’s <b>DELIVERANCE</b> to 59E59 this October.  As a small independent theatre company, we depend on individual support to realize each project we produce. </p>
<p>Adapting literature to the stage takes

Drama Desk Winner Godlight Theatre Company
celebrates its 20th Anniversary at 59E59 Theaters this fall with the world
premiere adaptation of James Dickey’s novel, DELIVERANCE. A heart stopping tour
de force, a mildly adventurous canoe trip explodes into a nightmare of horror
and murder. Men stalk and are stalked by other men and the treacherous river
becomes a graveyard for those without the strength or the luck to survive. 
Adapted for the stage, for the first time ever by Sean Tyler, and directed by Joe Tantalo, DELIVERANCE features long time acting company members Gregory Konow, Nick Paglino, and Bryce Hodgson, with a design team that includes lighting design by Maruti Evans (Drama Desk Winner), sound design by Ien DeNio (Drama Desk nominee), and costume design by Orli Nativ.

WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT


  

This campaign is so important because it will provide us essential working capital to bring James Dickey’s DELIVERANCE to 59E59 this October.  As a small independent theatre company, we depend on individual support to realize each project we produce. 
Adapting literature to the stage takes
courage.  It is an act of risk and
reverence as we excavate the dense world of language, imagery and ideas from a
novel hundreds of pages long and transport its many characters and landscapes
to the stage.  It is a negotiation with
the voice of the author and the realities of real time storytelling; a navigation
of themes and narratives as we labor to distill the essential while honoring
the detailed moments and nuance of the novel. 

The density of the novel can never,
truly, be translated to the stage. From the very beginning, our work has been
geared towards engaging the audience's collective imagination.  We give a blank canvas, an empty space that
our actors and designers use to create the world of the novel. This approach
strips away the dependence on realism and releases us to truly live inside the
story through adaptations grounded in the best of what theater can offer: a
world of imagination and wonder.
Our approach to translating
literature to stage is unique in the landscape of New York Theatre. At the
heart of our work is an ensemble of actors, designers and other creatives that
make up our company.  We are family of
artists working from a deeply formed bond, shared language and unified approach
to creating plays.  Almost every member
of the team on DELIVERANCE is a returning collaborator.  Many of the artists on our team have been
working with us over the last ten years or more.  
Our approach to adapting novels to
the stage as an ensemble company has been acknowledged with numerous awards and
recognitions including multiple Drama Desk Awards.  We are honored to have the company’s work
recognized. 
Our success is your success!  None of this would be possible without the
support of donors and our audience. 
 The risks and
costs associated with producing work increase every season. That’s why your
support is more essential than ever. 
WHAT WE NEED Your support!
We are raising $20,000 towards helping make our 20th Anniversay production of James Dickey's DELIVERANCE a success. 
All of the funds received will go directly towards the production costs of DELIVERANCE. 
What are the costs? 
Costs of the production include: lighting, costumes, scenic elements, sound, rehearsal space, and publicity. 
  THE IMPACT  Your contribution can help make all the difference in our success. We are a collective of artists, and our passion towards this project runs deeply. We all need the tools to make our art a reality. Your generosity makes all the difference.

<h2><strong>Support Jen &amp; Peter’s New Show at the Vancouver Fringe!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We are Jennifer Pielak and Peter Abando,<strong> two of Canada’s musical improv trailblazers and long time artist friends. </strong>We have come together as a duo and will be performing at the 2018 Vancouver Fringe Festival!</p>
<p>We have created a brand new show - <i>Inside Voices.</i> <strong>This is the scariest show we will ever perform, because we will be sharing the thoughts, judgements, and impulses that come up for us moment to moment  - in musical form.</strong> You know the stuff you think about that you’d rather other people not know? Yeah, those versions of yourself. Haaaaa…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533701489/rksstgoocwsxatpdzviq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Why in the hell are we doing something so terrifying?</strong></i> Because it is <strong>honest and vulnerable</strong>, and we hope that through sharing our inner weirdness, our audiences will learn that the <strong>things they think about themselves and try to tuck away can hold a lot of power</strong> (in more ways than one). To put it simply, the world could use a whole lot more acceptance of self and other.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533840891/zccys7kcwzuiugsq3sqf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>But, here’s the thing: we need your financial support! </strong>You can see more on production costs below, but to summarize, even if we sell 100% of our tickets (and in Vancouver the average attendance rate for theatre is 30%), we will barely make a profit. We are paying to produce this show out of our own pockets and relying on our team to generously volunteer most of their time (that includes us too). Why? Because <strong>we believe deeply that this show needs to be seen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So we’re asking for your help! </strong>Artists like us need outside financial support to keep making important, meaningful, and high quality work. We know this show is one of those works. <strong>We know there are people like you out there who want to support artists like us and who also believe in our work - and we are so grateful for it.</strong> SO GRATEFUL!!!</p>
<p>We couldn’t do it without you.<strong> Thank you!</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We are hoping to <strong>raise at least $1500</strong> to help us pay for production costs. If we meet this goal, we will continue to fundraise, because <strong>we actually need around $2300 to cover everything. Anything above and beyond this goes to the artists involved!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Budget Costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Festival/Venue (Space Costs &amp; Fringe Fees): $1445</li>
<li>Personnel ($200 Honorariums for Team Members): $1600</li>
<li>Production (Piano Rental, Costumes, Rehearsal Space, Program Printing, etc.): $900</li>
<li>Marketing (Online &amp; Print Advertising, Distribution, Photo/Video Production) : $955</li>
<li>Contingency Fund (there’s always that extra thing to pay for): $200</li>
</ul>
<p>TOTAL: $5100</p>
<p>Estimated Revenue from Tickets: $2790*</p>
<p>Amount We Need To Break Even: $2310</p>
<p><i>*This number comes from calculating a 30% fill rate, which is the average attendance rate for Vancouver Theatre shows. It is also Fringe, which means there are dozens of shows happening at the same time. $12 from every full ticket sold will go back to us, however with Fringe passes, comps and a 1/2 price show, a more accurate guess is $10/ticket.</i></p>

<h2><strong>More About Us</strong></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>We (Jen and Peter) are extremely good pals and musical improvisers.</strong> Or, as we are saying lately - because it feels more accurate - <strong>experimental musical theatre artists.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We love working with each other. We have special chemistry.</strong> This comes from developing shows, teaching classes, performing together, and experimenting with this unusual art form for 8 years. We know each other really well. We created the musical improv group Off Key Improv. We wrote <i>Connected: The Musical</i> (alongside Alison Chisholm) which got nominated for an Ovation Award. We’ve trained and performed together in Chicago and New York. We both keep ourselves busy as artists (Jen as a working actor &amp; acting/improv coach and Peter as a music teacher, music director &amp; composer), but manage to keep coming back to one another to work together. It’s a special thing and it’s rare and we know it.</p>
<p><strong>Now it is just the two of us.</strong> We’ve never performed as a duo before - it’s scary and exciting. We have to really trust and challenge each other. It’s like doing doubles figure skating - except in musical improv form.</p>

We loved what we discovered and have continued to develop the show over this past year. <strong>When we started, we had no idea what this show was going to be.</strong> Thanks to the help of many creative collaborators (special shout outs to Alison Chisholm and Raina von Waldenburg), audience feedback, extra training and many creative workshops shooting around in the dark, we’ve discovered a show that is very uniquely ours. It’s only something Jen and Peter can do. <strong>We can’t wait to share it with you.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Support Jen & Peter’s New Show at the Vancouver Fringe!
 
We are Jennifer Pielak and Peter Abando, two of Canada’s musical improv trailblazers and long time artist friends. We have come together as a duo and will be performing at the 2018 Vancouver Fringe Festival!
We have created a brand new show - Inside Voices. This is the scariest show we will ever perform, because we will be sharing the thoughts, judgements, and impulses that come up for us moment to moment  - in musical form. You know the stuff you think about that you’d rather other people not know? Yeah, those versions of yourself. Haaaaa…

Why in the hell are we doing something so terrifying? Because it is honest and vulnerable, and we hope that through sharing our inner weirdness, our audiences will learn that the things they think about themselves and try to tuck away can hold a lot of power (in more ways than one). To put it simply, the world could use a whole lot more acceptance of self and other.

But, here’s the thing: we need your financial support! You can see more on production costs below, but to summarize, even if we sell 100% of our tickets (and in Vancouver the average attendance rate for theatre is 30%), we will barely make a profit. We are paying to produce this show out of our own pockets and relying on our team to generously volunteer most of their time (that includes us too). Why? Because we believe deeply that this show needs to be seen.
So we’re asking for your help! Artists like us need outside financial support to keep making important, meaningful, and high quality work. We know this show is one of those works. We know there are people like you out there who want to support artists like us and who also believe in our work - and we are so grateful for it. SO GRATEFUL!!!
We couldn’t do it without you. Thank you!



 
What We Need
 
We are hoping to raise at least $1500 to help us pay for production costs. If we meet this goal, we will continue to fundraise, because we actually need around $2300 to cover everything. Anything above and beyond this goes to the artists involved!
Our Budget Costs:

Festival/Venue (Space Costs & Fringe Fees): $1445
Personnel ($200 Honorariums for Team Members): $1600
Production (Piano Rental, Costumes, Rehearsal Space, Program Printing, etc.): $900
Marketing (Online & Print Advertising, Distribution, Photo/Video Production) : $955
Contingency Fund (there’s always that extra thing to pay for): $200

TOTAL: $5100
Estimated Revenue from Tickets: $2790*
Amount We Need To Break Even: $2310
*This number comes from calculating a 30% fill rate, which is the average attendance rate for Vancouver Theatre shows. It is also Fringe, which means there are dozens of shows happening at the same time. $12 from every full ticket sold will go back to us, however with Fringe passes, comps and a 1/2 price show, a more accurate guess is $10/ticket.

<p>LESLEY:</p>
<p>""This project is going to give the actors opportunities that they might not otherwise get in terms of casting. Men will play women, women will play men and it is no big deal.

<br/><h2>About the Rejects</h2>
<p>Reject Theatre Project (RTP) is an emerging artist collective dedicated to creating and producing each member’s PassionProject before disbanding.</p>
<p>We are eight emerging theatre artists based in Philadelphia. We have created a collective that is dedicated to the creation and production of one PassionProject per member. We believe that there are a lack of entry-level jobs in Philadelphia for the amount of young theatre artists that the city is producing. The opportunities available don’t provide an outlet for artistic expression and leadership. Reject Theatre Project will provide fulfilling artistic opportunities to a variety of emerging theatre artists throughout Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Each of us posess a different artistic focus, aesthetic and skill-set. We have created a mission that will embrace each of these artistic voices and an environment that will nurture creative freedom, risk and collaboration. In exchange for each of our PassionProjects being produced, we will provide each other with mutual support until each vision is fulfilled. It is our goal to complete all eight productions before the end of three years. When our final PassionProject closes, we will detonate and document our journey for future theatre artists. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<div>We at Reject Theatre Project feel strongly that artists deserve to be paid for the work they do.  Our payment will simply be seeing our PassionProjects alive on the stage, but we have many artists helping us to achieve this goal who we want to compensate.  We also have various technical and practical needs that will be costing us.  So, we are asking for:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$1,100 for artist pay.  Coriolanus will feature 11 emerging actors.</li>
<li>$2,500 for space rental.  We will need to rent a space for one week of rehearsal and two weeks of performances.</li>
<li>$400 for various marketing and production supplies.  This will include programs, postcards, scripts, possible props, etc.</li>

<p><b>Maine Playwrights Festival  </b><span>April 23 - May 4</span></p>
<p><b>St. Lawrence Center for the Arts, Portland</b></p>
<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Now in its 13th year, Acorn Productions started the Maine
Playwrights Festival as part of our mission to nurture theater artists. Over
the years we have been proud to present hundreds of world premiere plays, some
of which have gone on to be produced at Festivals in New York and elsewhere.
For playwrights, this is an invaluable opportunity to see their words
interpreted by directors and actors and see how audiences react. For the actors
it is a unique chance to originate characters that will set the standard for
future productions of the work. For the audience it is an introduction to
emerging and established playwrights who live and write here in Maine. Who knows...some
day one of these playwrights could be accepting a prestigious award for one of
their plays and you can say ""I was there when they got their start at the
Maine Playwrights Festival!""</p>
<p>Your contribution toward our $3,000 goal helps make it possible
for Acorn to provide this important service to our community by helping with
overhead costs for this vibrant and exciting new works festival.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Your contribution is essential  to bridge the gap between what it costs to put
the Maine Playwrights Festival on and what we bring in from ticket sales.

playwrights.</p>
<p>Your $50

<p>La Bayadere is an iconic ballet best known for its serpentine entrance by 24 beautiful ballerinas donning classical white tutus.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Perpetro Independent Color Guard, a new competition color guard based out of Vallejo, CA. More importantly, we're a group of friends who have been spinning and teaching color guard
 together for years and it's always been a dream of ours to start an 
Independent Guard here in Vallejo. The rest of our dream consists of 
becoming a WORLD class guard and competing in WGI FINALS in Dayton, Ohio. Yes,
 extremely ambitious, but we're really hungry to perform and we've been working 
hard to get to this point. We have a crazy talented set of spinners/ 
dancers from all over Northern California as well as a top notch, world class staff and we're all really 
excited to show you what we can do! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Perpetro: To complete, accomplish, and perform.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By getting the funding we need to exist, we wouldn't just be making many of our own dreams come true, we'd also be providing our home town and the many talented performers here in Northern California with another place to continue their passion for color guard, dance, and the performing arts after high school and for years to come.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've listed our need for a MINIMUM of $600 so anything and everything will help! And if we exceed this goal, we will be even more grateful for your kindness and support. With the funds we raise, we'd be able to put it toward paying off insurance and competition fees, purchasing a performance floor (mat), poles and flags, uniforms, and plane tickets for our trip to WGI FINALS in Ohio. Please take a look at the sidebar for more information on donation amounts and their corresponding fun incentives for helping us out! :) And to make some of these incentives more affordable, we suggest splitting the cost with a group of friends!<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Boogaloo is what his father started calling him after a mommy and me class proved that Joe was destined to dance. At 18 months old he broke loose from a circle dance, went to the center of the circle and started to boogie. At that moment I knew what his calling was. At 2 1/2 years old, the earliest anyone would take him,  he began his dance training in tap. Forced to make a decision at age 5 if he would rather continue dance or tennis lessons he chose dance--the rest is history. Tap never really got into his soul--so at age 6 we added hip hop and jazz but it wasn't until he was introduced to ballet at age 8 that he found a true passion for dance. Despite many financial hardships we continued funding his dance career and eventually got him into the academy of arts in Hartford where he also became passionate about modern and choreography.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's where you come in - Joe would very much like to graduate from his arts high school next year while also continuing his training at night. I am a single mother on disability and his father is a shut in on social security battling cancer. I have always struggled to give the best to my son--but can no longer afford the transportation to the bus stop everyday. We estimate the mileage for next school year to be 20,550 and the gas cost to be 2850.00, car maintanance to be 1,200 and replacing his worn out dance clothes and shoes to be 850.00 (he has been dancing in the same tights for almost 4 years).If the goal I have set is not reached then the money will be used to get Joe to his night classes only.</p>
<p>In return for your genorosity you will receive an autographed photo of Joseph during a performance. Should he ever be a famous dancer you will have an exclusive autographed photo potentially worth a considerable amount. For a greater donation you will receive tickets to a show so that you can see the effects of your efforts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Joe has been a key dancer at the Academy of Arts. He is the only person that has danced in a show his freshman year, he has been in dance classes above his grade level and this year he was elected by the staff to be the dance representative for the senior class. Joe needs to graduate from the Academy to have a better chance of getting into college for dance. He already has a few colleges selected but needs your help to get through next year.</p>
<h3><strong>His Dedication</strong></h3>
<div>It is obvious to me that Joe takes refuge in his dance, it is his life, his therapy, his companion, his passion.Though he talks to his father several times a week he hasn't seen him in almost 2 years --dance somehow lightens the burden of not having a father present in your life. Every day Joe gets up at 5:00--we leave for the bus stop at 5:45 which he catches for 6:30 to arrive at school for 7:30 classes. Academics  end at 1:00 and arts classes begin and go until 4:15. He has 3 hours of dance classes at school. He then takes the bus to Southington where I pick him up at 5:30 and rush him to Woodbury Ballet where he has 2 more hours of ballet. He finally gets home around 9 pm to eat dinner and do homework. On Saturdays he dances at either New England Ballet in Orange or Woodbury Ballet in Woodbury. During Nutcracker season we estimate he dances approximately 30 hours per week. Joe does all of this while maintaing A's and B's in his honor and advanced placement academic classes. His dedication to his craft is limited only by financial and time constraints.</div>

As the number of young people of color who are affected by the prison system continues to soar, students in this Theater-in-Education experience will explore the effects the economic-based prison industry has on this country and their own communities. As a team of five actor-teachers, we will implement the piece in two 12th grade economics classrooms at Wadleigh High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Harlem (New York, NY) this spring.</span></p>

Today, Harlem faces problems of over-policing, racially-targeted stop-and-frisk policies, and high rates of incarceration. Despite a lack of difference in drug use between racial groups in New York, people of color, and especially black men, are more frequently arrested for drug crimes, and convicted more harshly, than their white counterparts.

In an economically driven society, whose lives do we choose to value?
“Prison Production” will use theater to teach young people about the US prison system through an exploration of its expansion from the late 70’s to the late 90’s. As the number of young people of color who are affected by the prison system continues to soar, students in this Theater-in-Education experience will explore the effects the economic-based prison industry has on this country and their own communities. As a team of five actor-teachers, we will implement the piece in two 12th grade economics classrooms at Wadleigh High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Harlem (New York, NY) this spring.
Wadleigh is a performing arts school located in a community whose struggle with racial justice has earned historic attention, and whose pioneering spirit in the arts has captured the imaginations of generations of US performers. Today, Harlem faces problems of over-policing, racially-targeted stop-and-frisk policies, and high rates of incarceration. Despite a lack of difference in drug use between racial groups in New York, people of color, and especially black men, are more frequently arrested for drug crimes, and convicted more harshly, than their white counterparts. Meanwhile, prisons that house these folks are built to alleviate poverty in largely white upstate communities. Educators and academics have tended to ignore this history, which has been decades in the making.
What is Theater-in-Education (TIE)? Theatre-in-Education asks students to utilize various dramatic skills for learning goals outside of the art form itself. TIE utilizes techniques that are particularly useful for learning about history:

Group role play to explore the decisions made by people and communities in a particular historical context.
Short prepared performances by the Actor Teachers to deliver historical information 
Interaction with the characters in the story to give advice, ask questions, and understand why and how their situations occur
Scene creation by students to reflect contextually and emotionally on what they have learned and draw connections to previous knowledge, and their own lives.
Prison Production
“Prison Production” concerns itself with stories in two New York communities, Harlem (in Manhattan) and Malone (in upstate New York). 
In the first class session, students will meet characters in Harlem who are affected by the prison system, interacting with them and their community to understand the economic factors at play.
In the second session, students will step into role as residents of the town of Malone in rural upstate New York in 1998, where plans to build the Upstate Correctional Facility are in the works. The students will attend a town hall meeting in which various residents and policy-makers will speak about the pros and cons of bringing the prison to their town. The students will vote on whether or not to bring the prison to Malone as well as learn about how the real building of the prison affected Malone.
In the third session, students will be able to reflect on the previous two sessions and make connections between them, looking directly at how they are economically tied and what policies in history led to the dramatic increase in prison building in rural upstate communities in the 1990’s. 
As actor-teachers, we are trained to not only perform theater, but lead students in critical reflection on the historical situations so that they may develop their own understanding of why and how choices were made, and how those choices have impacted their communities.
Why support this project? 
Your donations will help support the development stages of this project, which include:

Five professional actor-teachers - each one of us will receive a stipend, not a salary, for the project. We’re in it because we are passionate about the topic and about exploring it with young people. Yet getting paid will help us legitimize this work in the field and allow us to devote the time and energy to the project that it deserves.
Our expenses - we’ve kept our budget low, but we still have a few expenses, such a props for the theater, and printing and copying. 

After we implement the project in late May, we'll reflect on how it went and hopefully be able to pitch it to more schools from there!
As independent artists on this project, we are working without institutional support. We’re exploring what it takes to create work on our own, in partnership with a school, without the structure of an organization backing us up.

<p>Putting on a production of Tony Kushner's <em>Angels in America</em> is a daunting task for any company, but taking it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is another matter entirely.  We will be the first production of <em>Millennium Approaches</em> to go to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (ever) precisely because this is such an ambitious production to stage in a festival setting.</p>
<p>But that's what makes this show so special.  Our production of <em>Angels in America</em> will have a pared-down style, thereby making the epic elements of the play all the more spectacular by contrast.  As in our St Andrews run, this will be a fundamentally actor-driven event, with an attention to the text as our main focus.  Above all, we want this production to tell the stories of Kushner's characters, stories that – while firmly rooted in the culture of the late 1980s – remain universally relatable in the 21st century.  <em>Angels</em> deals with issues ranging from illness and disease (mental as well as physical) to how we construct our identities within a culture that is a melting pot of political, racial, religious, and sexual beliefs.  </p>
<p><em>Angels in America </em>is not only a masterful piece of theatre, it tells a timeless story about how we choose to live our lives in a multi-faceted and constantly changing world.  Please help us tell that story by giving us your support!  </p>

But that's what makes this show so special.  Our production of Angels in America will have a pared-down style, thereby making the epic elements of the play all the more spectacular by contrast.  As in our St Andrews run, this will be a fundamentally actor-driven event, with an attention to the text as our main focus.  Above all, we want this production to tell the stories of Kushner's characters, stories that – while firmly rooted in the culture of the late 1980s – remain universally relatable in the 21st century.  Angels deals with issues ranging from illness and disease (mental as well as physical) to how we construct our identities within a culture that is a melting pot of political, racial, religious, and sexual beliefs.  
Angels in America is not only a masterful piece of theatre, it tells a timeless story about how we choose to live our lives in a multi-faceted and constantly changing world.  Please help us tell that story by giving us your support!  
In the words of the Angel: The Great Work Begins...

<h3>Here's our story:</h3>
<p>Same Planet Different World Dance Theatre was founded in 1997; since then, SPDW Dance has become a prominent presence within the Chicago dance community. Focusing on dance that is evocative and enjoyable, SPDW showcases a diverse repertoire that consists of works from nationally renowned choreographers while incorporating the styles of classical and contemporary modern dance, jazz, and improvisational experimentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now the time has come to spread the passion of dance to the rest of the country, and hopefully one day, the rest of the world! SPDW Dance has received a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to New York City to perform their A.W.A.R.D. Show! 2010 finalist piece, <em>Grey Noise</em>, at the A.W.A.R.D. Show showcase at The Joyce Theater June 2nd &amp; 3rd, 2011! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Grey Noise</em> is a work for five dancers choreographed by SPDW Artistic Director, Joanna Rosenthal, and inspired by film noir of the 1940's and 1950's. With its intense physicality and emotionality, <em>Grey Noise</em> depicts an environment where people are on edge, unpredictable, and hard to control. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>SPDW Dance has a goal to inspire their audiences, both big and small. We realize that the audience is just as important as the moves themselves; without our audiences we would not have the opportunity to perform- ever! </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>This exciting venture will offer a chance to inspire a new audience in a new place; we will reach another outlet to express how exhilarating modern dance truly is while generating a greater appreciation for the arts!</p>

Way back in 2010 a playwright by the name of Jonathan Blistein and actors Daniel Abeles, Nate Miller and Laura Ramadei worked together on a play: Keep Your Baggage With You (at all times). The sold out houses and critical response boded well for the collaboration, to say the least:""The Holy-Grail of adventurous theatregoing"" - NYPress ""Thrillingly austere, provocatively perplexing...Blitstein has an ear 
for honest dialogue...the whole cast should pack for Hollywood soon."" - The AdvocateFollowing the success of the production, the team decided to officially join forces and form Lesser America.  Soon thereafter the company was offered an unprecedented residency by the iconic Theater for the New City and set in motion plans for their 2011-2012, inaugural season. The company will present its first official show, the world premiere of Squealer, opening May 5. Written by Jonathan Blitstein, Directed by Daniel Talbott:Squealer follows an ambitious pork farmer with a roving eye who moves in with a 
widowed single mother and her teenaged daughter. When he can't get what 
he wants, things get bloody. A full-on taste of America's poverty-soaked
 obsession with consumerism and our unquenchable thirst for more, 
whether it's meat, or love, or both.Find out more about the production by visiting www.lesseramerica.com.

<p>En 2009, Sasha
Dominique a assisté à une représentation en anglais de cette pièce et elle est
tombée sous le charme du texte et du défi que cela représente pour une comédienne :
seule en scène pendant 1h40 à interpréter une vingtaine de personnages âgés de
3 à 82 ans, par la versatilité de la voix et du corps.</p>
<p>Ça y était :
elle venait de trouver son prochain projet artistique. Avec l'appui incontestable de toute l'équipe du Théâtre de la Vieille 17<i>, </i>qui a à l'époque pris le projet sous son aile, Sasha a pu présenter deux étapes de sa traduction en mises en lecture, qui ont toutes deux été dirigées par André Perrier, également metteur en scène actuel du spectacle.   </p><p>Voici enfin venu le moment tant attendu,

tombée sous le charme du texte et du défi que cela représente pour une comédienne :
seule en scène pendant 1h40 à interpréter une vingtaine de personnages âgés de
3 à 82 ans, par la versatilité de la voix et du corps.
Ça y était :
elle venait de trouver son prochain projet artistique. Avec l'appui incontestable de toute l'équipe du Théâtre de la Vieille 17, qui a à l'époque pris le projet sous son aile, Sasha a pu présenter deux étapes de sa traduction en mises en lecture, qui ont toutes deux été dirigées par André Perrier, également metteur en scène actuel du spectacle.   Voici enfin venu le moment tant attendu,
7 ans plus tard,  de la production. Nous
sommes fébriles et enthousiastes à l’idée de vous présenter ce morceau
d’anthologie portant sur l’Afrique du Sud.
Représentations

Les représentations à
Ottawa en février 2016 sont présentées au Studio Léonard-Beaulne (135, rue
Séraphin-Marion) aux dates et heures suivantes : 
mercredi 10 au samedi 13 février: 20h00 
dimanche 14 février : 14h00
Ce dont nous avons besoin &
Ce que vous obtenez en retour
Notre équipe
administrative ainsi que les concepteurs impliqués dans ce projet travaillent
avec cœur et acharnement afin de vous offrir une pièce d’une grande qualité
artistique. Bien entendu, une production théâtrale ne peut pas se concrétiser
sans apport financier : nous avons déjà obtenu une partie des fonds
provenant des trois paliers du gouvernement (municipal, provincial et fédéral)
mais ceci ne couvre pas tous nos frais de production. 
C’est là où VOUS « entrez en scène »
chers parents et amis. Nous avons besoin de votre appui afin de rendre ce rêve
réalisable. 
Votre contribution
(de 10$ à 100$) nous aidera à couvrir les frais suivants :
·  Le matériel publicitaire (cartons promotionnels, affiches,
programmes)
·  Le matériel pour la construction du décor (sans oublier la
balançoire!)
·  Le matériel promotionnel (captation vidéo, vidéos
promotionnelles ponctuelles, photos)
·  La mise en marché (relations médias, recherche de commanditaires,
frais d’inscription à des événements de promotion auprès des diffuseurs)
·  Le salaire des personnes assignées à ces diverses tâches
En guise de
gratitude pour votre générosité, voici ce que vous obtenez de notre part afin
de vous remercier pour votre don : 
Don de :
10$ - 25$  - un courriel de remerciement
personnalisé;
50$ - mention sur les médias sociaux
70$ - mention sur les médias sociaux et 10$ de rabais sur le prix de

<h3>Brief history of the project</h3>
<p>My name is Liliya Lifanova and I am a multidisciplinary artist based in New York. </p>
<p>Three years ago I picked up a copy of <i>The Waste Land</i> by T. S. Eliot and it resonated in a truly meaningful manner. It was clear to me that Eliot's work reflected my fragmented life experience within the labyrinth of antiquity in generative form that produced a vision that was unexpected, exciting - uniquely my own. </p>
<p>Since then, the poem has accompanied me through 5 residencies across the country and 7 different studios in NYC. During these paths, I have been patiently and persistently writing the score, hand-crafting the sculptures, performative objects, paintings, drawings, and garments that will 'frame' <i>Flight Over Wasteland,</i> a sculptural installation, performance, and film. </p>
<p>Hiroya Miura, a composer of Japanese origin, joined me on this journey in 2015. His thoughtful <a href=""http://www.hiroyamiura.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">work</a> and ideas on the text gave me the energy to press on in creating this project and to see it through to the end. </p>
<p>Earlier this year my proposal was accepted at the <a href=""http://knockdown.center/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Knockdown Center</a> to take place in April 2017. This is a<strong> </strong>tremendous opportunity. Knockdown Center has an exceptional art program and was recently described as one of the most exciting art venues in New York City by Roberta Smith of the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/arts/design/galleries-shift-shape-to-survive-in-a-changing-art-world.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Times.</a> I am thrilled to present this work in such a breathtaking space and exploit the cinematic possibilities of this venue in the film version of the piece. </p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>The plan is as follows:</p>
<p>During one week in April 2017 my sculptural installation and Hiroya's sound installation  will be on view and open to the public at the Knockdown Center.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480199436/appt8tkkizigo3z4deoh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Elements of FOW sculptural installation (img. John Curry Studio courtesy of Rooster Gallery)</p>
<p>During the same week we will be shooting <i>Flight Over Wasteland</i><i>,</i> amidst the aforementioned sculptural and sound installation and in other parts of Knockdown Center, with the talented Chicago filmmaker Yoni Goldstein, with whom I've had the privilege to collaborate on <a href=""https://vimeo.com/10307983"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a> project in the past.</p>
<p>On April 15, 2017, we will debut the performance of <i>Flight Over Wasteland. </i>This will be followed by Q&amp;A with curator Jodi Waynberg  and the presentation of a specially designed cocktail <i>(Mud Flight)</i><i>.</i></p>

<p>1/4 of this amount will cover the expenses of producing the remaining sculptural and sound elements of the installation, effect props, as well as to cover the Lighting Designer fee. </p>

<h3>Thank you for supporting this production and Nora’s Playhouse!</h3></div>","Nora’s Playhouse is a women's theatre company promoting women's stories.
Our upcoming production of THE FALLEN gives breath to the haunting stories of the Bosnian War. Spanning twenty years, Yasmine Beverly Rana's moving play reveals the lingering repercussions of the conflict while ricocheting from the rooftops of Sarajevo to the balconies of Turin to the art galleries of London. 
The stories of the Bosnian War are not only important to share, but timely, since the war crimes trials are occurring now:
Mladic intended to 'ethnically cleanse Bosnia'
We need your support to get this production off the ground!

<p><b>THEATER IN ASYLUM (TIA) begins its 2013/14 season with a remounting of  <i>¡Olé!</i> in three cities: Chicago, IL; Hartford, CT; and Rochester, NY.  </b><br/></p>
<p>THEATER IN ASYLUM is a New York City-based dance-theater company founded in 
2010 to provide asylum to highly-charged subjects and characters. With 
thrilling performance, we suspend preconceptions, analyze a subject’s 
origins and leave audiences with new-found understanding and empathy.<span> </span><br/></p>
<h3> Our Show<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>TIA's<i> ¡Olé!</i> is a 70-minute flamenco theater piece following two of the 20th century’s greatest artists—Federico Garcia Lorca: poet, romantic, believer and Salvador Dalí: painter, modernist, scientist.</b></p>
<p>Their tumultuous love affair began in college and ended with Dalí’s flight to Paris as Spain descended into civil war. Set in a gypsy cave ruled by a flamenco dancer and her guitarist, this 
non-chronological play begins just after Lorca and Dali break up and 
flashes back to reengage their courtship, passion, and falling out. Through personal letters, public declarations, and private musings, <i>¡Ole! </i>invites you to engage with these two brilliant minds as they continually challenge and debate art’s purpose: What is art? How do we create art? Why do we create art?</p>
<h3>The Show's History<br/>
</h3>
<p><i>¡Olé!</i> began its development in the fall of 2011 when Artistic Directors Paul Bedard and Katie Palmer became obsessed with Lorca's and Dalí’s disagreement over the function and origin of art. After traveling to Spain in 2012 to dig further into the culture and art that shaped the two artists, we presented a number of incarnations as we tried to determine what shape this play would take. In February 2013, the Horse Trade Theater Group gave us the opportunity to present <i>¡Olé!</i> as a full-length play at the UNDER St. Marks Theater in New York. <br/></p>
<p>After an extremely successful run at UNDER St. Marks, we applied to the Chicago and Rochester Fringe Festivals and were accepted into both. Soon after being accepted, we booked an engagement at the Carriage House Theatre in Hartford, CT, Paul's hometown. We are thrilled to share this beautiful, passionate, and important work with these three cities. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Our Team</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

This is a show that we truly believe in. The story of the Guilford Four isn’t just an interesting moment in UK’s history, but it tells a wider story about what can happen when a miscarriage of justice takes place.
Having just created a smash hit show at The Bunker, interest in what Eastlake Productions brings to the table next is high, and we believe that though we are in the early stages of our career with this project, this show will help us to make a great impression up in Edinburgh.
Risks & ChallengesTaking a show to Edinburgh Fringe is notoriously financially difficult, having a small team like ours means that we are all having to put in a huge amount of time, energy and love into this play to make things happen.

<p>NMI:  We're producing 12 brand-new musicals this June at the Hollywood Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>YOU:  Are you insane?</p>
<p>NMI:  Yes.  But we're involving 24 writers, over 50 actors, 6 directors, and 4 music directors in 1001 minutes of musical theatre, so there are a lot of us who are insane together.  The writers include David Jayden Anthony, Ron Barnett, Brad Beaver, Harriet Belkin, Norman Belkin, Joe Blodgett, Maureen Borillo, Stephen Coleman, Chris Edgar, Mitch Glaser, Keith Dale Gordon, Jana Hejdukova, Grace Jasmine, Ross Kalling, Dan Margules, John Piraino, Ross Plotkin, Jerry Ranger, Bryon Richards, Sandy Shanin, Robin Share, Chris Smith, John Sparks, Clifford Tasner, Dan Wessels.</p>
<p>YOU:  That's like 16 hours of new musicals?</p>
<p>NMI:  Well, sorta.  It's 16 hours of performances.  The musicals themselves are actually all one-acts, about 20 minutes long.  You can see three shows in one hour-long performance slot.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490650556/nxi9gtexzikjgidacjtv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>YOU:  So to see all twelve musicals I'd be attending four separate productions.</p>
<p>NMI:  You got it.  We've grouped them into double-feature-sized time-slots, so you could see six musicals in two hours.</p>
<p>YOU:  That sounds great.</p>
<p>NMI:  It will be!  But it's also expensive.</p>
<p>YOU:  I sense a commercial coming on....</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490650576/cdtnhrvjlpmnose6mga1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>NMI:  It takes a lot of money to book the theatre space, rehearsal space, and the directors, and music directors...plus royalties for the writers.  And marketing, advertising, and all that jazz.  It's costing us about $25,000.</p>
<p>YOU:  $25,000.  At $15 a ticket....</p>
<p>NMI:  At $15 a ticket, with 1,000 seats to sell, we're still losing about $10,000.  That's where you come in.  We really could use your help in one of two ways.  Either a straight donation to cover some of the costs, or make a donation and choose one of our fun perks - like a turkey dinner, or a coloring book of Jewish curses.  Some of our perks are actually tickets to the actual shows.</p>

<p>Q.  Aren't tickets more expensive to buy that way?</p>
<p>NMI:  True dat.  And if you're looking just to buy $15 tickets, those go on sale on May 1st.  But this Indiegogo campaign is designed to help us cover our costs.  So, yes, your $15 tickets will cost $30 or $50, but you'll be helping a great cause <i>and</i> getting to see three new musicals.</p>

<p>YOU:  Tell me about the musicals.</p>
<p>NMI:  Thought you'd never ask.  They range from romantic nostalgic shows to outrageous, okay, downright naughty shows, and everything in between.  There's one about Jack (of Beanstalk fame) falling in love with his Giant; there's one about two dweeby nerds trying to hit on girls through Dungeons and Dragons.  One's about internet porn; actually three of them touch on internet porn.  One's a film noir musical about dames, dicks and butter knives.</p>

<p>NMI:  Yes.  All of them are being developed here at New Musicals Inc.  We;ve been creating and producing new musicals for many decades.  We develop musicals for producers all around the country, but this is the first time we've written shows specifically for the Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>YOU:  They all sound fun!  How do I help contribute?</p>
<p>NMI:  Just make a donation - with or without a perk.  If you get tickets as your perk, we'll get you set up with those.</p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p><strong>Here is a rare opportunity  to be part of something very special within the Theatre world because, Premier Pieces by Dario Fo do not come round that often. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It will be because  your support that helps us get this wonderful project on the world wide stage for the very 1st time....quite literally, we will collaboratively all be making history as it's written about in future Drama Education Books.

<p>             My name is Brent Shultz and I have recieved a scholarship to attend the California State University Summer Arts 2013 Program. The course I am attending this summer is Drama 620, Stage Combat: Rapier and Dagger SPT Intensive; a two week intensive course focusing on the skills and techniques needed to create the allusion of violence with weapons on stage through fight choreography. Coordinated by Dr. Terry Smith, the course this year culminates in a Skills Proficiency Test by Society of American Fight Directors Master, Anthony Carreiro, whose fight direction I have had the honor of working under during California State University, San Bernardino's 2005 production of Macbeth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Currently, I am in my second year at The New School for Drama in New York City, working towards a Master of Fine Arts Degree in Acting. As part of the curriculum this semester we are studying Stage Combat under Broadway Fight Director, Tom Schall; with whom I will also be working as fight captain with for our Shakespeare production this Spring. While the class covers a wide range of stage combat techniques and skills needed by actors working in most basic theatrical productions, I was disappointed to learn that there wasn't any type of accreditation towards our development as working professional artists. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Actors who have professionally certified fight training are more marketable and find work in theater and film both as performers and as fight choreographers. It is my intent to use the training gained from Drama 620 to assist in the Stage Combat and Classics courses at The New School next year; as has been the case with other certified trained students in the past, as well as to further me in my professional acting career. </p>

While I have recieved a schoalship towards tuition, I am a Full-time Graduate Candidate living in NYC who is only able to work Part-time; money is already of great concern. This year’s tuition for out-of-state Graduate students is set at $3,093.00 towards 3 credits; not including travel costs, housing/ meal plans, and unpaid time from work. I consider myself to be a hard worker and any fortunate success I have achieved has stemmed from a great deal of preparation meeting the right opportunity.

<p>We are passionately devising a play about our national relationship to food, the science of food production, farming, farmers, livestock production and processing, and the earth itself in 2013: basically, the many complex ideas and questions around what we eat and how it gets to our plate.</p>
<p>The journey of The Food Play began two years ago when director Pirronne Yousefzadeh read Barbara Kingsolver's book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle and began to think about her own food choices. She realized that she hadn’t seen anyone address these issues using theatre as a catalyst for discussion and change. Over many months of development, Pirronne brought together four playwrights, nine actors and two composers. Together, this diverse group has been co-creating a multi-narrative theatrical event that asks these questions: where is our food culture going? Is there a way to accommodate growing demand while also protecting our natural resources? How can we strengthen our relationship to food as it connects us to the people around us, to our families and to our communities?</p>

<p>Todos los días nos levantamos a hacer lo que mas nos gusta, Circo y teatro, somos tercos y soñadores… buscamos gente que sienta parecido y que quiera juntarse a la colecta que tiene como fin reconocer el trabajo del elenco. Gracias a los diferentes tipos de gestión y al autofinanciamiento hemos podido cumplir con las diferentes etapas de producción que necesitamos para llegar al estreno el 7 de Junio de 2013. El vestuario, la escenografia, la utilería, la técnica aérea, el diseño grafico y otros ítems que aportan gran valor a la producción están siendo cubiertos, falta el mas importante, el elenco. Un porcentaje de la taquilla de la temporada será destinado al grupo y esperamos que tu colaboración aumente el fondo. Como una forma de agradecer tu espíritu altruista diseñamos un plan de recompensas y diferentes montos con los que puedes aportar.</p>

We are looking for people that feel the same as us and want to join us in the fundraising that has the finality to recognize the cast´s work. Thanks to many different ways of self-financing we have been able to cover costs as some production stages that we need in order to perform our premiere presentation which will be on June 7th 2013. Wardrobe, props, graphic design and other items that add a very high value to our production are already covered, but we are missing the most important part, the cast.

¡Necesitamos tu ayuda!
Todos los días nos levantamos a hacer lo que mas nos gusta, Circo y teatro, somos tercos y soñadores… buscamos gente que sienta parecido y que quiera juntarse a la colecta que tiene como fin reconocer el trabajo del elenco. Gracias a los diferentes tipos de gestión y al autofinanciamiento hemos podido cumplir con las diferentes etapas de producción que necesitamos para llegar al estreno el 7 de Junio de 2013. El vestuario, la escenografia, la utilería, la técnica aérea, el diseño grafico y otros ítems que aportan gran valor a la producción están siendo cubiertos, falta el mas importante, el elenco. Un porcentaje de la taquilla de la temporada será destinado al grupo y esperamos que tu colaboración aumente el fondo. Como una forma de agradecer tu espíritu altruista diseñamos un plan de recompensas y diferentes montos con los que puedes aportar.
We need your help!
We wake-up every day to do what we like the most; theatre and circus., we are big dreamers and very stubborn…. We are looking for people that feel the same as us and want to join us in the fundraising that has the finality to recognize the cast´s work. Thanks to many different ways of self-financing we have been able to cover costs as some production stages that we need in order to perform our premiere presentation which will be on June 7th 2013. Wardrobe, props, graphic design and other items that add a very high value to our production are already covered, but we are missing the most important part, the cast. A percentage of the ticket office sales for our show will be destined to the cast and we hope your collaboration and funding can raise the pot for them.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Skills &amp; Scars is an experience in game and theatre that invites audiences to create a world of their own. In this intimate show, the hospitality of one artist’s home becomes a backdrop to audience’s wildest adventuring desires. The show takes place in a Fishtown residence, the location of which is sent to participants when they purchase their ticket. </p>
<p>Successfully completing this crowdfunding campaign will allow us to complete our gameplay research to craft the most robust system possible.</p>
<p>This is the first collaboration between Philadelphia-based game-and theatre-makers, Jeffrey Evans, Devin Preston, and Nick Jonczak. We're using our knowledge of what makes a compelling narrative performance to craft a gaming experience for audiences that allows them to role-play the values that they'd like to see in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $2,000 to cover the cost of game materials, food/hospitality for our audience, insurance and application fees, our time in developing this experience, and more.</p>
<p>We have a lot of exciting perks that give you an insight into our process of making this game and a chance to influence future games that we make! In particular, check out our map/story perk. You'll get your pick of a unique, high-resolution digital map of a game world created by our playtesters -- full of mysteries, objects, and lore just waiting to be discovered. Can you uncover what our heroes couldn't? OR, select the story option, and you'll receive a short story based on the events of a playtest game. Some of our past games include a sci-fi space opera, a Stranger Things-style mystery, a cyberpunk creation myth, and more. Discover the rich worlds created through improvised, collaborative storytelling!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds we've raised will go first to providing the most hospitable environment possible for our audiences.  Our primary goal is serving the community that makes the story together -- after that, we'll cover our other expenses for making the show.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At its core, Skills &amp; Scars offers an opportunity to take the private and make it public. In our current world, private-made-public is often not a choice, but a fact of life. We reverse that dynamic, and make it a choice. What does it mean to opt-in to real sharing? With whom do you share? With each audience, we guide folks in building a supportive group that encourages, rather than invades. We invite them to put their doubts and foibles into the game itself, and the characters they make champion their own real life hopes and dreams. These characters (and the players embodying them) serve as representatives of the audience, and the players take on the responsibility of representing their newly-minted community. </p>
<p>The result is that Skills &amp; Scars allows audiences the space to test out values that they want to see in themselves and the world, and to ask themselves: Are we willing to fight for these values? How can we be champions for these values in our own communities? With our combined 30 years of experience in making theatre and games, we create this space to find out.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Intrepid Fools have big plans for Summer 2019 and we need your help! Our new family show ‘Viking’ is seeking a new home at the Edinburgh Fringe and beyond and in order to get there, we need just a little bit more money.</p>
<p>We’ve been working on this show since the very first days of 2018. Firstly we spent a few days learning about the Vikings and playing around with swords in a very cold room (method, we know) and then spent many long days writing in a variety of very hot rooms. We then had two weeks of solid devising, rehearsing, and learning our instruments under the patient instruction of Alastair. Our previews in the Robinson Theatre were a brilliant way to round off the summer, we had so much fun with absolutely fantastic crowds! After being awarded the ‘Pickles’ Fund’ from the New Diorama Theatre, we also had the exciting opportunity of getting feedback from a National Student Drama Festival selector, much of which we plan on working into our show in our next rehearsal period. We also have lots of exciting potential show dates coming up before we head to the Fringe, updates coming soon.</p>
<p>We want to thank everyone who has helped us so far; Hills Road Sixth Form Drama Department for giving us rehearsal space, a venue for our preview shows and generally being very accommodating, the Cambridge Junction for providing us space for our R&amp;D period, Fusion Theatre Festival for everything they’ve done for us over the last two years, and everyone who has given advice or watched any of our shows.</p>
<p>We have been squirrelling away savings for the last year and have a considerable amount of money between the five of us, enough to pay for our accommodation. We are now looking for your help as a final push to aid us in reaching our target budget. Your money would going towards ensuring we can afford our dream venue at the Fringe and making sure we can reach as many people as possible, through a targeted marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Any contribution, no matter what size, would be greatly appreciated by us all. Thank you in advance for your generosity.</p>

Waiting for Johnny Depp takes us on a wild ride with New York actress Rita Donatella, in her quest to land the role of a lifetime in a Johnny Depp film.   She constantly re-invents herself to be more perfect for the role, as she navigates the rough waters of surviving in the big apple with her dream intact.   It is both hilarious and heartwarming, to see how Rita comes to terms with the big questions:  how to survive financially, how to recognize true love, how to balance the demands of career and family, and ultimately, what is really important in life?
 

What We Need & What You Get

We need $15,600 for production expenses including: cast, stage manager, set, insurance, lighting designer, festival fee, rehearsal studios, music director, and flights and living expenses for the creators. 
We need lodging for Bettie, Deedee and Janet from July 13th through August 30th.  Can you be our host??
For investments at a certain level, we will offer contracts with interest in future commercial productions.
For angels who love us, we will offer fun perks along with our eternal love and gratitude!


The Impact

It is our mission in life to uplift and inspire people.  Although our audiences laugh out loud during WAITING FOR JOHNNY DEPP, they also walk away feeling hopeful and inspired.  It is our goal to reach people everywhere with our message of love and hope. 
As we mentioned above, we've had 3 successful productions in the past. But this is our chance to take it to the next level and beyond!!

The Mission



As the winner of T. Schreiber's New Works Project, we've received a generous grant of $1,000 to cover production costs and help pay our out-of-this-world designers, but that money stops short of covering our EXTENSIVE video and projection related costs (have you ever shopped for a projector??

That's why we're looking to YOU to help make ""Austin Babbish's Landfill Lecture Series"" a reality! Our goal is to raise matching funds (another $1,000) to cover all our projection-related costs and complete the vision of this wild, technically-ambitious new play.
We've got lots of great perks, including many that will let you secure your tickets to the production now!

Who's Involved


- There's AUSTIN BABBISH (Todd Woodard): An eldest son, an older brother, a former fiancé, and also a former gay lover (coincidentally to the former fiancé’s brother).
- His mother, CAROL BABBISH (Ellen Tobin): The widowed-then-jilted matriarch of the Babbish clan, struggling to understand her apparent failures as both a mother and a lover.
- His younger brother, JACKSON (Matthew Ballinger): The kid brother who abandoned his family in their darkest hour and ran away with the girl of his dreams (who may or may not be a terrorist).

<p><font><br/></font></p>
<p><b><u><font>The Play</font></u></b></p>
<p><font>ANDROMAC was written by the French Classisist <b>RACINE </b>in 1667. First performed in the Queen's appartements at the Royal palace in Paris, NDROMAC was a huge succes from the start. Over the centuries, many great actors have graced the stage in productions of ANDROMAC. The part of Hermione was one of Sarah Bernhard's favorite roles.</font></p>
<p><font><br/></font></p>
<p><b><u><font>Plot Synopsis</font></u></b></p>
<p><font>Shortly after the violent fall of Troy, <b>Andromac,</b> widow of Hector, becomes the slave of the Greek<b> King Pyrrhus</b>. She is pregnant with the next heir of Troy, a fateful birth that could threaten all the Greeks have fought for in the war.</font></p>
<p><font><b>Orestes</b> demands the death of this unborn baby on behalf of the Greeks as this child might one day avenge fallen Troy. Pyrrhus refuses but only because this refusal might win him the heart of Andromac.</font></p>
<p><font>Meanwhile, Princess<b> Hermione,</b> that once loved Orestes<b>,</b> has been sent to wed Pyrrhus as a peace offering  by her father, but she is still waiting.</font></p>
<p><font>Everybody is loving and waiting for someone who doesn't love them back....</font></p>
<p><b><font>Love , Politics, Passion, Jealousy...Tragedy ...Theater....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font><br/></font></b></p>
<p><b><u><font>The Present</font></u></b></p>
<p><font>We are very happy to be able to rehearse daytimes for FREE at the ACT ONE studios in Chicago! We will hold daily rehearsals whenever the actors are available and not at their dayjobs.At night and on weekends we are using our own living rooms until tech week. We are gratefull to our girlfriends and roommates for letting us invade the private home space to create this show.</font></p>
<p><font><br/></font></p>
<p><b><u><font>The Promise</font></u></b></p>
<p><font>We promise to create a show you will not forget and each of you contributors will be a part of our journey! </font></p>
<p><font>A show that is cutting edge, takes risks, raises questions.<br/>A show that will mix media's, be bold and of artistic quality.</font></p>
<p><font>A show that might have been written in 1667 but that is actual, engaged and engaging!</font></p>
<p><font><br/></font></p>

<p><font>Please help us make this vision a reality. In exchange for your contribution, you will receive <b>some fun, one-of-a -kind perks</b>, listed in the sidebar, as well as our promise to bring this work to the stage with all of our passion, dedication, craft and knowledge.

(Introduce yourself and tell your campaign's story. Make sure to cover the who, what, where, when and how of your campaign.)

We are extremely grateful to all who will help us reach the $1000 benchmark in our ANDROMAC campaign!
Thanks you so much for your help on this journey, and please continue to contribute generously and to spread the word far and wide all the way from the rubble of Troy, to the green plains of Attica, to the beautiful land of Epirus, to the magnificent Chicagoland !! With your help and trust, we the European director NoÃ©mi Schlosser and a team of wonderful Chicago actors can create an extraordinary show!

The Play
ANDROMAC was written by the French Classisist RACINE in 1667. First performed in the Queen's appartements at the Royal palace in Paris, NDROMAC was a huge succes from the start. Over the centuries, many great actors have graced the stage in productions of ANDROMAC. The part of Hermione was one of Sarah Bernhard's favorite roles.

Plot Synopsis
Shortly after the violent fall of Troy, Andromac, widow of Hector, becomes the slave of the Greek King Pyrrhus. She is pregnant with the next heir of Troy, a fateful birth that could threaten all the Greeks have fought for in the war.
Orestes demands the death of this unborn baby on behalf of the Greeks as this child might one day avenge fallen Troy. Pyrrhus refuses but only because this refusal might win him the heart of Andromac.
Meanwhile, Princess Hermione, that once loved Orestes, has been sent to wed Pyrrhus as a peace offering  by her father, but she is still waiting.
Everybody is loving and waiting for someone who doesn't love them back....
Love , Politics, Passion, Jealousy...Tragedy ...Theater....

The Present
We are very happy to be able to rehearse daytimes for FREE at the ACT ONE studios in Chicago! We will hold daily rehearsals whenever the actors are available and not at their dayjobs.At night and on weekends we are using our own living rooms until tech week. We are gratefull to our girlfriends and roommates for letting us invade the private home space to create this show.

The Promise
We promise to create a show you will not forget and each of you contributors will be a part of our journey! 
A show that is cutting edge, takes risks, raises questions.A show that will mix media's, be bold and of artistic quality.
A show that might have been written in 1667 but that is actual, engaged and engaging!

We Ask You
Please help us make this vision a reality. In exchange for your contribution, you will receive some fun, one-of-a -kind perks, listed in the sidebar, as well as our promise to bring this work to the stage with all of our passion, dedication, craft and knowledge.

What We Need & What You Get

(Break it down for folks - how much money do you need and where is it going? Be transparent and specific and be sure to address where the money goes if you don't reach your entire goal. For example, do you have other funding sources? Does part of the campaign still happen? Ensure people they are not just buying you dinner. Use this area to tell people about your unique perks, too!)

What is the money for?
Like often in Chicago, the artists come last... even if they are the ones without whom there simply would not be a show...so if they are not being paid even if we reach 1000 dollars, where does the money go?
- the rental of the performing space ThinkTank
- the front of house people
- a small budget for costume, set and props

If we raise more than $1000, every dime would go towards
- a small marketing campaign and a person to help promote our shows
- the possibility to print a minimum amount of posters and flyers to be hung in selected places
- pay a stipend to all the good people who are otherwise helping out with their crafts for free and out of the  kindness of their hearts: the light and sound person, the poster designer, the marketing person, the press release person...
- a stipend to compensate the sweat, blood and tears of the actors and the creative team

What are we prepared to do?
Our special perks include beauty packages from Arbonne, all organic ( while supplies last)
But also for gifts of $250 you can choose all different very personal perks offered by our team, including the choice of a three course Belgian homecooked meal, a photoshoot session/headshot or a workshop in sign language to name just a couple.

Other ways YOU CAN HELP
So even if you donate just a dollar, you can still help by spreading the word and inviting your friends, family and colleagues to participate in this ANDROMAC fundraiser through Indiegogo!
And off course we do invite you to come and be an audience member during our shows!
Thanks so much, a million times!

The Honey Land
The Honey Land is part installation, part performance, using video, soundscape and organic art forms to create a place out of time that inspires new ways of being together and experiencing the environment.

 
Artistic Director Terre Unité Parker (a former company member and production manager for Anna Halprin) leads our interdisciplinary team of collaborators from New England, Canada, and California. Since October 2011 we have performed two invitational showings and at Parker's MFA graduation from Goddard College (Plainfield, VT) in February 2012.
 
On June 23rd we will present this work to the public for the first time! Please consider a donation to support production costs, video documentation, and artist stipends for our public premiere.
 

The Honey Land is a rare opportunity to dip into the world of the senses. The installation explores utopian visions of connection between people and the natural enviornment.
 
This project is supported in part by a grant from the Northampton Arts Council, Inc. and donation of materials from Southworth Paper Company, Turners Falls, MA. All artists have donated their time, talent, equipment, and production support!
Any support you can imagine is appreciated!

<h3>Gutenberg! The Musical!</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Doug Simon and Bud Davenport are authors of a big, splashy new musical about printing press inventor Johann Gutenberg.

But Bud &amp; Doug can sing, dance and most importantly, they have HATS!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Developed by Scott Brown and Anthony King at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in NYC, this two-man musical spoof puts you right in the action of these two aspiring playwrights trying to get their show to Broadway.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The media may have moved on to other topics, but the need for Hurricane Sandy relief is still very real. The Pennsylvania Burlesque Festival has pledged to donate a portion of ticket proceeds to Habitat for Humanity's Disaster Relief fund.</p>
<p>The PA Burlesque Festival delivers two world-class shows at Plays and Players Theatre, Delancey Place, Philadelphia on March 8 and 9. Friday March 8 is ""FRIDAY NIGHT DELIGHT,"" headlined by Deanna Danger (Richmond) with a special appearance by Penny Starr, Sr. (Philadelphia.) Saturday March 9 is ""THE BIG REVEAL"" wherein 16 performers from across the USA and Europe compete for the Crystal Corset Award and $2300.00 in cash prizes.</p>
<p>Over the past 3 years, our producer, Brooke Au Buchon, (AKA show hostess Madame Corsetiere,) has donated nearly $10,000.00 to non-profit charities from the proceeds of ticket sales. It is her wish, and the wish of our cast, to use the PA Burlesque Festival to help Habitat for Humanity get Sandy-ravaged families back into their homes and back on their feet. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We are asking our fans and friends to help us meet our expenses so that we can donate a substantial portion of our ticket sales to Habitat for Humanity's Disaster Relief Fund.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our performers travel hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles to entertain our fans, so we provide them with nice lodgings during their stay with us. We are asking that you help us meet our hotel expense of $3,000.00 so that we, in turn, can donate the same amount, if not more, to Habitat for Humanity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition to donating funds for Hurricane Sandy relief, we are also collecting non-perishable food items at both shows, to be given to the NJ FoodBank. Habitat for Humanity and the NJ FoodBank are both working selflessly to sustain Hurricane Sandy victims through these bitter winter months. Together, we can help them continue their good works.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>What do you get? Aside from the good feeling that comes from making a difference, perks for donating to our campaign include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autographed PABF posters</li>
<li>FaceBook and Twitter mentions about our donors and/or their businesses</li>
<li>Advertising and ""Special Thanks"" on <a href=""http://www.paburlesque.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.paburlesque.com</a>
</li>
<li>Tickets to the PABF shows!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>Our campaign funds are delivered regardless of whether or not we meet our $3,000.00 goal. We hope to exceed $3,000.00 so that we can donate more of our proceeds to Habitat for Humanity.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
The PA Burlesque Festival receives wonderful media coverage. It is our wish to use this attention to help spread awareness of the ongoing need in NY and NJ presented by the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Every mention helps, and it is our pledge to donate ticket proceeds equal to the amount this campaign earns. You can help Habitat for Humanity make sure that home is where the heart is.</div>

We are <b>Bess Welden</b>, <b>Ann Tracy</b>, <b>Julia Langham</b> and <b>Karen Ball</b> - an informal
collective of Portland, Maine theater artists working together to co-produce
the <b>world premiere of Bess’ new one-act play, MADELEINES. </b>As part of <b>Portland Stage’s Studio Series</b>,
the show will run <b>November 18-22</b>. For performance
dates/times and ticket info: <a href=""http://www.portlandstage.org/studio-series/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.portlandstage.org/studio-series/</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re super
excited about the creative team for the project, which includes Portland-area
professionals: Karen Ball &amp; Julia Langham (actors), Ann Tracy (director), Meg
Anderson (set), Chris Fitze (sound), Michaela Denoncourt (lights), Jewels
Murphy (props), and Andrew Hesselbart (stage manager).</p>
<p><b>MADELEINES</b> <b>is about
family recipes, sibling rivalry, and unexpected revelations. </b>Think of it as
a <b>short story for the stage</b>. Debra has returned to her childhood
home to care for her declining mother Rose, an exacting baker who supported her
daughters with a successful cookie business. When Jennifer, Debra's older
sister, arrives for Rose's funeral, shared memories and old sibling grievances
boil to the surface. <b>As the sisters confront their loss, a startling secret about
their mother’s favorite Passover recipe emerges, changing everything they
thought they knew about themselves, each other, and their family.  </b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443533225/nzlh8no2dajpcxaxef0f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>(all photos courtesy of Snowlion Repertory Company)</i></p><p>Early
audiences have called the play “moving” and “powerful.” One fan wrote: <b>“You truly captured the mixture of guilt and anger and
love that siblings often carry for each other, especially when it comes to
caring for aging parents.  Your sisters were real, and honest, and
believable, both in their struggles with each other and in…themselves.”</b></p>
<p><b>We need to
raise $2,500</b> to reach
our overall budget of $4,000. The great news is that Portland Stage is providing
performance space, box office services, and help with marketing, so our overall
production costs are very low. Business sponsorships from Dean’s Sweets, Maine
Home Connection, Churchill Events, Artisan Hair Salon, and in-kind support from Running with Scissors Artists Studios  plus ticket sales
will get us partway to our goal, but we still need your help. With just six
weeks before Opening Night, we are turning to you to ask for<b> contributions to

<br/></div>","Hello world!
We are Bess Welden, Ann Tracy, Julia Langham and Karen Ball - an informal
collective of Portland, Maine theater artists working together to co-produce
the world premiere of Bess’ new one-act play, MADELEINES. As part of Portland Stage’s Studio Series,
the show will run November 18-22. For performance
dates/times and ticket info: http://www.portlandstage.org/studio-series/.

We’re super
excited about the creative team for the project, which includes Portland-area
professionals: Karen Ball & Julia Langham (actors), Ann Tracy (director), Meg
Anderson (set), Chris Fitze (sound), Michaela Denoncourt (lights), Jewels
Murphy (props), and Andrew Hesselbart (stage manager).
MADELEINES is about
family recipes, sibling rivalry, and unexpected revelations. Think of it as
a short story for the stage. Debra has returned to her childhood
home to care for her declining mother Rose, an exacting baker who supported her
daughters with a successful cookie business. When Jennifer, Debra's older
sister, arrives for Rose's funeral, shared memories and old sibling grievances
boil to the surface. As the sisters confront their loss, a startling secret about
their mother’s favorite Passover recipe emerges, changing everything they
thought they knew about themselves, each other, and their family.  (all photos courtesy of Snowlion Repertory Company)Early
audiences have called the play “moving” and “powerful.” One fan wrote: “You truly captured the mixture of guilt and anger and
love that siblings often carry for each other, especially when it comes to
caring for aging parents.  Your sisters were real, and honest, and
believable, both in their struggles with each other and in…themselves.”
We need to
raise $2,500 to reach
our overall budget of $4,000. The great news is that Portland Stage is providing
performance space, box office services, and help with marketing, so our overall
production costs are very low. Business sponsorships from Dean’s Sweets, Maine
Home Connection, Churchill Events, Artisan Hair Salon, and in-kind support from Running with Scissors Artists Studios  plus ticket sales
will get us partway to our goal, but we still need your help. With just six
weeks before Opening Night, we are turning to you to ask for contributions to
honor our commitment to pay artists for their work. All Indiegogo funds will directly support modest stipends for the nine artists
involved in the project. 
In exchange
for your contribution, you’ll have the satisfaction
of knowing you helped bring a brand new play to life - especially one written,
directed and performed by women. You’ll also get a fun perk or two. We
promise to bake your reward cookies with as much flavor and care as the play’s
characters would demand.

</div></div>","Destination Dance: a site-specific dance tour through downtown Reno
Site-specific dance is work that is created in response to a particular place or site, inspired by its architecture, design, history, or current use. Destination Dance will feature the work of local choreographers who have been commissioned to create unique performances juxtaposed against iconic downtown fixtures, taking traditional and contemporary dance off of the stage and into a new environment.   What We Need & What You Get  We are raising $4,200.00 to supplement the pay for the 28 local dancers who will be performing in the event. While we do have funds set aside for them it is not nearly at a rate appropriate for the amount of time and dedication the event requires. For your contributions, we have a few awesome perks, including Destination Dance Buttons, autographed flyers, and VIP access to dress rehearsals. If we don't reach the entire goal, the funds will still be divided up amongst the performers.    Reshaping the Conventional Notions of Performance
Eve Allen, founder of Downtown Dance Collective in Reno, NV, has been commissioned by Artown to execute Destination Dance during the July 2015 festival.  Allen, alongside local choreographers Rosie Trump, Cari Cunningham, Katie Jean Dahlaw, and Rebecca Bone, will create new works that reshape the conventional notions of performance. 


Destination Dance was commissioned by Artown (the month-long city-wide arts festival) in celebration of it's 20th year. Artown admires innovation and proudly stands behind local projects that amplify the local community. The project aims to embrace the avant-garde ethos of the July festival, demonstrate the talent of our local emerging artists, and attract an audience that is not accustomed to viewing dance.


On Thursday, July 23, tour guides will lead groups departing from the Lear Theatre at 6:00pm, 6:20pm, 6:40pm, and 7:00pm. They will be equipped to discuss the history behind the various sites and the inspiration behind each artist’s choreographic decisions.


The event is free to the public, and people will be welcome to join the tour for as many stops as they choose. 
Featuring urban and natural sites located in the Riverwalk District in downtown Reno, this walking-distance dance tour will allow audience members to engage with dance in a whole new way and view some of Reno’s most treasured locations in a new and invigorating light. Utilizing signature monuments in the heart of Reno such as the Ross Manor’s garden, the Truckee River Whitewater Park, Wild River Grille in the historic Riverside Hotel, the steps of the Washoe County Courthouse, and the porch of the Lake Mansion, Destination Dance will celebrate our city’s unique sense of place through movement.   The Dancers  While we will pay all of our performers, it is not commensurate with the talent and time spent on this project.  Your contribution will ensure that our local artists are compensated for their hard work and performances at a more realistic and professional rate.    Event Details Even if you can't contribute, we hope to see you at the event!

The Smooving Project is a culminating street performance piece exploring connections between people, memory, and dreams developed by a team of alumni and graduate students of California State University, Long Beach.  We are a highly diverse team of theatre practitioners - all of us coming from different backgrounds; be it in our career paths or our birth countries, we have a multitude of perspectives and a wealth of stories to tell.  
This group of individuals were seeking to tell their personal stories in a way that moves past the boundaries of cultural constructs, language, and the academic institution; and we have sought artistic refuge in the open forum provided the SpaceLab program of the Prague Quadrennial Design Exhibition. 
 Fortunately for us, we've been invited to perform!   
Help us dive into our dreams, literally and figuratively, by helping us take our work to Prague.

What is Prague Quadrennial?


Prague Quadrennial is the largest theatrical design event in the world, showcasing the latest trends in theatrical design and architectural design of event spaces.  Held every four years, Prague Quadrennial 2015 will be in its 13th edition, continuing a tradition of highly artistic endeavor that brings together over 5,000 theatre and design practitioners from all over the globe and attracts over 50,000 visitors.  
To be selected as an exhibitor is an honor and privilege that is highly exclusive -
The Smooving Project is one of only 30 performances chosen among 400+ applicants for the SpaceLab and only one of five schools from the United States to be featured in this amazing program!

Thus, we are turning to you for help!  
Your donations will go a long way towards supplementing what we have already self-funded in order to take this show international.  There are five of us who will be travelling and performing this piece at the Quadrennial, here are the breakdown of expenses:
$1500/person - Average roundtrip flight from Los Angeles to Prague
$300/week - Group housing in Prague per person
$250/week - Average food costs in Prague per person
$110/person - Average costs of international travel documentation 
$20/week - Cost of public transport within Prague per person
$40/person - Registration and accreditation with the Prague Quadrennial administrative team 
$200 - Approximate cost of supplies needed for the performance (sketchpads, markers, paint, tape, cardboard, etc)
Total Expenses:  $11,300

Why $7,015?
This number has special meaning to us!  We know that asking for $11,000 is asking a lot of your kindness, so we wanted to make a more attainable goal in order to maximize our return from IndieGoGo.  There are 7 of us, which how we came up with the initial number, and then we wanted to commemorate the Quadrennial by adding the '15 to the end.

<p>I graduated from the University of Northumbria in 2006 with first class honours in Ba(hons) Dance:Choreography and have been creating and performing dance and performance art at a professional level ever since.</p>
<p>As a choreographer I love to explore unusual performance spaces. When I was studying for my A-level in dance back in 2000 I was introduced to Trisha Brown's works ""Walking on the Wall"" and ""Man Walking Down the Side of a Building"" and was totally fascinated. In both works the dance floor is shifted from the ground to the wall with the dancers suspended at 90 degrees perpendicular to the floor. This challenged the notion of traditional dance spaces, what is possible in terms of the use of gravity, what the dancer's base of support is, what is possible when your dance surface is changed.  As a person and an artist I aim to push myself to continually develop and grow. The purpose of this project is to marry my passion for exploring unusual performance spaces and my desire to move outside of my comfort zone as an artist inspired by the notions raised in Brown's work over 40 years ago. By exploring the potential of and creating dance within a unique environment with no fixed  ground, namely a giant bubble floating on a pool of water I hope to push the boundaries of what is possible in modern dance.</p>
<p>The funds raised will pay for the equipment I need to begin this research and development project - a water walking ball, a portable pool, an air pump and hose, pay for rehearsal space and produce video footage.</p>
<p>This will be an entirely new experience for me. I have danced on a studio floor thousands of times and I've done some aerial work, I have done fire manipulation and stilt walking but I have never tried to dance on what pretty much amounts to an entirely unstable surface inside of a continually moving ball. It will be a big challenge but one I look forward to with much relish and excitement!</p>
<p>If you can't give or chose that you don't want to donate to my fund I would really appreciate it if you would help me to raise awareness of my campaign by sharing it on your social media pages.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>*Prevod na srpskom se nalazi dole!*</p>
<p>Belgrade English Language Theatre, Riverhouse Barn and Esher High have been working on a collaborative youth project centered on the rivers that breathe life into their communities: The Danube, Sava and Thames.   </p>
<p>The collaborative piece of the project will take place in two parts.  </p>
<p>The first will be located in Belgrade, Serbia.  Students from the UK will join students from Belgrade from April 3rd-7th to begin workshopping their performance together, using existing ideas and performance models that each group has worked on separately in their home countries.  During this time, the students from the UK will also enjoy a tour of the city, helping them to explore Serbian culture and the cultural significance of the two rivers.</p>
<p>In the second part of the project, the groups will meet again, from April 29 to May 4, this time in Walton-on-Thames in England.  Serbian students will be hosted by those in the UK and enjoy tours of both Walton-on-Thames and London, while participating in final performance workshops. These activities will culminate in a live performance of the groups at the theatre there.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In the coming weeks, we will be doing everything we can to raise any money to help fund visas, travel, tours and funds for production values (props, costumes and more!)  While our goal is set at $500, anything above and beyond that will only help to further the students' experience of the cities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is an incredible opportunity for the students involved not only to meet people from a different culture, but to experience different teaching styles, explore a new and exciting setting, and finally to collaborate and develop a performance piece that is uniquely their own.  </p>
<p>Belgrade English Language Theatre has previously led successful youth theatre trips to Croatia, England, Italy the Czech Republic. These trips have provided students with invaluable skills and opportunities.  They have been able to work with diverse international theatre artists, perform to new audiences, and see exciting performances.  These experiences are priceless, but would have been unattainable without the generosity and fundraising efforts of members and friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While organizing any trip abroad is a complex process, organizing a trip to the UK is particularly complicated and expensive. Unlike all other European countries, the UK and Ireland still require people from Serbia to secure a visa for short visits (even creative and educational ones!), which in itself costs 90 pounds (with no guarantee of it being awarded). But we are determined that despite the financial and  bureaucratic challenges we will make this opportunity a reality.</p>

<h1>A short synopsis of our play:</h1>
<p>In a world where there is an unequal distribution of power and the elements on the periodic table have been shoved into tiny boxes of separation, class, characterization, and identification, unrest stirs amongst Groups 1 &amp; 2 to rebel against the Nobles! The missing element is an explosive artistic endeavor which infuses the art of storytelling and education with exploratory design and performance. Through the means of steam-punk meets Victorian style costuming, robotic lighting, graphic projections, originally composed
electronic music, and modern meets capoeira dance, artistic elements mirror the
reactions and relationships between chemical elements. As the fundamental laws of chemistry are defined, denied, and destroyed, this genre of scientific fantasy attempts to explain and interpret basic patterns and trends of Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table. In a fight for freedom and equality, love and loss is found as the age-old adage of opposites attract cannot be denied! </p>
<h1>Costumes:</h1>
<p>Our costume designer has come up with some wonderful and exciting costumes for our characters, the elements.</p>

With your help you can see this elemental world become a reality in the Oscar G. Brockett Theatre at the University of Texas at Austin on April 14 through 17th.
 
A short synopsis of our play:
In a world where there is an unequal distribution of power and the elements on the periodic table have been shoved into tiny boxes of separation, class, characterization, and identification, unrest stirs amongst Groups 1 & 2 to rebel against the Nobles! The missing element is an explosive artistic endeavor which infuses the art of storytelling and education with exploratory design and performance. Through the means of steam-punk meets Victorian style costuming, robotic lighting, graphic projections, originally composed
electronic music, and modern meets capoeira dance, artistic elements mirror the
reactions and relationships between chemical elements. As the fundamental laws of chemistry are defined, denied, and destroyed, this genre of scientific fantasy attempts to explain and interpret basic patterns and trends of Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table. In a fight for freedom and equality, love and loss is found as the age-old adage of opposites attract cannot be denied! 
Costumes:
Our costume designer has come up with some wonderful and exciting costumes for our characters, the elements.
For example:
 Olexia - Oxygen Carbonius - Carbon Silla - SiliconLighting:Our lighting designer also has grand plans. She plans to use a total of 21 intelligent lighting fixtures to create a lightscape similar to that of space and the stars. With the use of haze, she can achieve things like this.
 
Projections:Our projection designer is aiming to emulate the elements and explain complex scientific research through the use of video and still imagery.   Music:
And lastly, our composer has begun writing original music to create an atmosphere of sound for our elemental world.
Audio SampleAll in all, our show promises to entertain and educate in a way that hasn't been seen before. Perhaps we can encourage the young and not so young to pursue a life of intellectual adventure and artistic creation. So please, join us in April as the age old tale of love and loss showcases the undeniable fact that opposites do in fact attract.",7.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Below is an interview I had with myself to let you know as much as I could about this new production.</span></p>
<h3>WHAT IS <i>LILY, CASUALLY</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Lily, Casually </i>is a rock n' roll musical about modern romance, financial struggle, and a woman named Lily White, who kills a ton of despicable men. It will be performed by some of the most talented musical theater actors in New York, accompanied by an amazing live rock band (<a href=""http://www.rocketandtheghost.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rocket &amp; the Ghost</a>). If you like rock n' roll, strong female characters, and having a ridiculously good time, then <i>Lily, Casually</i> will definitely be one of the greatest things you've ever seen.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS IT ABOUT?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Lily and Jimmy White are a young married couple trying to make ends meet in the metropolitan Northeast. Lily works as a secretary and Jimmy scams the unemployment system. Eventually, Jimmy's illegitimate income catches up with him, and he lands himself in prison.</p>
<p>Lily finds herself lonely, angry, and unable to pay all of the bills she split with Jimmy. Deciding to get her mind off things, she delves into the world of online dating. When a date ends in homicide (albeit, self-defense), Lily White starts to become the monster the world has been begging her to be.</p>

<i>Lily, Casually </i>touches on some pretty serious themes, including religion, feminism, and socio-economic immobility. That said, it's still an over the top comedic, glam-rock thriller, so even if you don't care about themes and <i>meaning</i>, you'll still have an amazing time (see list above).

<h3>WHY AM I DOING THIS?</h3>
<p>I learned at a very early age that if you have a story to tell, the best way to tell it is with a rock n' roll musical.</p>
<p>I remember going to the public library as a child, looking for a scary movie to rent. As I scanned the modest collection of VHS tapes, I spotted a black cover with nothing more than letters made of blood spelling out the title. It was perfect; it had the word ""horror"" right in the title.</p>
<p>What I had rented that day at the library was Richard O'Brien's masterpiece, ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" So I didn't end up watching a scary movie that night. But what I did watch changed my entire life. It was the greatest thing I had ever seen – it had rock n' roll, fake blood, motorcycles, and people having an awesome time by any means necessary. It exposed me to sexual liberation, gender ambiguity and Meatloaf, and I questioned none of it. The impression that film left on me can be summed up in the chorus of it's penultimate song, ""don't dream it, be it.""</p>
<p>As I got older, my love affair with rock n' roll and theatrics continued to grow. Leaving undergrad with a degree in finance, I made the prudent decision to go across the Atlantic and play in an English rock band. After a stint of being a quasi-homeless ex-pat, I returned to New York, went to law school, got a job, and then walked away from it because what I really had to do was write this rock n' roll musical.</p><p>The two main things my experiences have taught me are how to work hard, and how to put on a great show.

We have done much of our fundraising already through throwing after parties for SFU Dance productions, selling SFU Dance logo clothing, and applying for and receiving a grant from the Simon Fraser Student Society.  However, we are still about $250.00 short of our budget for the show.  Our budget consists of the following: Technical supervisor- $30.50/hour for 26 hours- total $793Front of House - $94/show for 2 shows- total $188Cashier- $50/show for 2 shows- total $100Lighting Designer honorarium- $200 - 2 designers- total $400Stage Manager honorarium- $200 - 1 stage manager- total $200Assistant Stage Manager honorarium- $100 - 1 ASM - total $100Technical Director - $200 - 1 TD - total $200Musicians/Composer honorarium - $100 - 3 musicians - $300Costumes - $20 - 10 dancers- $200Posters/programs printing- $100 - total $100 Total expenses- $2,581We have raised over $2000.00 but we need your help to be able to pay our lighting designers, stage manager, and technical director in order to make this show a reality! Any little bit helps! We do have some lovely perks as a thank you for your donation, see the perks section for details! 
  Where your contribution goes
Our show is our launch into the Vancouver and International dance community.  It is our opportunity to stage our own work and invite important industry professionals to see what we can do.  We are also documenting the show for further granting and project applications as many applications require footage of past work in order to be considered.  Your donation helps support the next generation of young dancers, choreographers, and artists break into the field with a bang! 
  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot donate to our cause, we thank you for viewing our campaign! If you can spread the word about the show to your friends we would be much obliged.  A robust audience helps make our work come alive and we would love to share all that we have been doing with you! See our Facebook event for more information about the show and thank you for your interest in our work! https://www.facebook.com/events/1579555328928845/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My name is Stephanie Peña. I am an aspiring choreographer from New York City.  My practice derives from contemporary dance
techniques, which focuses on dramatic expressions.</p><p></p>
<p>I am graduating
in May of 2014 from the City University of New
York at Hunter College with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Dance. </p>
<p>Through
my studies and practice, I have become a passionate
choreographer, performer and teaching artist. During the winter of 2014, my dancers and I were
welcomed to perform at both the Baltimore Dance Invitational and The 10th
Amalgamate Artist Series. As a
dancer, I have had the
opportunity to perform at the 2013 American College Dance Festival and in many
performances at Hunter College and Movement Research. As a teaching artist, I
have taught salsa with Salsa New York, and at the Positively 8th Street
Festival, a festival dedicated to bringing positivity to the community.
Additionally, I have taught private belly dance lessons and worked as an
assistant dance educator at the Harkness Dance Center at the 92nd Street Y. I
truly believe dance is a form of art to be expressed amongst people of all
ages, sizes, and colors.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/552398/files/20140502094250-IMG_3792.jpg?1399048970"" src="""" style=""width: 564px; height: 376px;""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b><u>The
Opportunity</u></b></p>
<p>My dancers and I were invited to showcase my dance piece
titled, “What Am I Doing Here?” in Ticino, Switzerland.  At the festival my dancers and I will have
the opportunity to showcase the piece at a formal showing during the week and
at the Ticino in Danza Gala. During the day we will be taking dance classes, participating
in workshops and partaking in the community outreach.  </p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Why Ticino
in Danza Festival at Switzerland?</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>According to the Ticino in Danza website, “Ticino in Danza
Festival creates an international platform for professional choreographers and dancers
to show their work and expand their network abroad as well as connect with
other artists, exchange ideas and interact.”  Their goal is for dancers/choreographers to
share their personal art and culture, but most of all have the ability to teach
their style abroad. This will be an amazing opportunity to dance
with choreographers from other countries and share a choreographic experience
of professionalism, culture and enrichment of dance. It will provide us the
opportunity to see how people from around the world understand dance and how
dance shapes their perspective.  We will
be connecting with mature artists within the international professional dance
scene to become more inspired with new perspectives, ideas, and goals. </p>
<p>

Need?</u></b></p>
<p>This incredible experience to Ticino, Switzerland will not
happen without your support. As an emerging artist, I don’t have the funds for
this project. Therefore, I am asking for your kindness and support to make this
project a reality. Any donation, whether small or large, will be a big help. Our
hearts are committed and we are set and ready to participate in this amazing project.
All we need is your help to make this dream come true.</p>
<p>The Ticino in Danza Festival will only provide
about 45% of the cost for the workshops and dance classes. My four dancers and
I will need funds for traveling expenses, food, hotel accommodation, and the other
55% of the festival expenses.</p>
<p><b><span>The grand
total will be $18,215</span></b></p>

Additionally, I have taught private belly dance lessons and worked as an
assistant dance educator at the Harkness Dance Center at the 92nd Street Y. I
truly believe dance is a form of art to be expressed amongst people of all
ages, sizes, and colors.

The
Opportunity
My dancers and I were invited to showcase my dance piece
titled, “What Am I Doing Here?” in Ticino, Switzerland.  At the festival my dancers and I will have
the opportunity to showcase the piece at a formal showing during the week and
at the Ticino in Danza Gala. During the day we will be taking dance classes, participating
in workshops and partaking in the community outreach.  

Why Ticino
in Danza Festival at Switzerland?

According to the Ticino in Danza website, “Ticino in Danza
Festival creates an international platform for professional choreographers and dancers
to show their work and expand their network abroad as well as connect with
other artists, exchange ideas and interact.”  Their goal is for dancers/choreographers to
share their personal art and culture, but most of all have the ability to teach
their style abroad. This will be an amazing opportunity to dance
with choreographers from other countries and share a choreographic experience
of professionalism, culture and enrichment of dance. It will provide us the
opportunity to see how people from around the world understand dance and how
dance shapes their perspective.  We will
be connecting with mature artists within the international professional dance
scene to become more inspired with new perspectives, ideas, and goals. 

What Do We
Need?
This incredible experience to Ticino, Switzerland will not
happen without your support. As an emerging artist, I don’t have the funds for
this project. Therefore, I am asking for your kindness and support to make this
project a reality. Any donation, whether small or large, will be a big help. Our
hearts are committed and we are set and ready to participate in this amazing project.
All we need is your help to make this dream come true.
The Ticino in Danza Festival will only provide
about 45% of the cost for the workshops and dance classes. My four dancers and
I will need funds for traveling expenses, food, hotel accommodation, and the other
55% of the festival expenses.
The grand
total will be $18,215
