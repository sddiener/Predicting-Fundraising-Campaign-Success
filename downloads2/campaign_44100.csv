center so we go there to develop our new goggle this summer for revolutionizing
the scene! KOS Mixski goggle is a dawning concept, where customers simply buy 1
pair of goggle to enjoy the use of multiples. When you have KOS Mixski, you do
not need another!</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>DIY: </b>Customers can have fun snapping on
different parts of their own goggles. You can choose only the frame, or the
lens, or just the straps to do mix and match yourself! It is not only fun but
can substantially save costs. It is simple and environmental too. You do not
need to discard your goggle and buy a new one every winter!  If you decide your straps are getting worn,
you can simply purchase new straps and replace the old one yourself.  Easy!</p>

<p>Buy 1 pair of KOS Mixski goggle, and then
you can buy the parts -- just frame or just len or just strap. They are all
interchangeable! You do not have to buy a new entire pair of goggle anymore in
the future. Len has been scratched, then I buy the Len only to replace my
original, or I can definitely buy 2 frames for my holiday in the ski resort,
changing it each day by myself.</p>

<h1><b>Let's try our goggles!</b></h1>

<p></p>
</div></div>","KOS Background:
Represents: Knock Over S!  We want to knock over the old ways!We love skiing, but we spill too much cash
on goggles every year! Why we always have to buy another goggle just because of
lightly scratched-up lens, faded frames or dirty marks after ski? Why we always
cannot find the colors we want? Hey! I want something different!   I want something cool! Now, we are having a Goggle Revolution!
We know Taiwan is a goggle-manufacturing
center so we go there to develop our new goggle this summer for revolutionizing
the scene! KOS Mixski goggle is a dawning concept, where customers simply buy 1
pair of goggle to enjoy the use of multiples. When you have KOS Mixski, you do
not need another!
DIY: Customers can have fun snapping on
different parts of their own goggles. You can choose only the frame, or the
lens, or just the straps to do mix and match yourself! It is not only fun but
can substantially save costs. It is simple and environmental too. You do not
need to discard your goggle and buy a new one every winter!  If you decide your straps are getting worn,
you can simply purchase new straps and replace the old one yourself.  Easy!
How does it works?
Buy 1 pair of KOS Mixski goggle, and then
you can buy the parts -- just frame or just len or just strap. They are all
interchangeable! You do not have to buy a new entire pair of goggle anymore in
the future. Len has been scratched, then I buy the Len only to replace my
original, or I can definitely buy 2 frames for my holiday in the ski resort,
changing it each day by myself.
The color of your goggles don't match your
outfit? Never again!

You can definitely pick and choose any
color you wishes for your goggle frame, lens and straps according to our
color numbers (We have more than 7 color groups with one secret group for your choice! You can only find the color of secret group after order placed!) Our team has put a lot of efforts into colors, printings and
patterns design. We want something special comparing with the goggles now you
see in the stores, to make you always appear cool and unique!BLACK GROUPRED GROUP

Our Frame is made of polyurethanes (PU)
which is really soft material. It comes with triple layers soft face foam which
make you feel comfortable.
It is also designed to put over your
optical frames. Even you wear the prescription glasses, no need to put it off
when skiing!
We, KOS, always pursue to the superior lens
quality, not just the basic function of UV400. Our provided lens are
poly-carbonate with Double Inner Len which is made in Italy with very good
anti-fog effect. Our straps are made with 3 waves of durable
silicone material that can be anti-slip, stretched and pulled without breaking! 

With the very nice and special design, our straps look so cool!





















This winter, with KOS MIXSKI Goggles, you will always
impress!

No more restricts of limited frames, lens and straps!

<p>Piktochart is a young startup based in Malaysia, and we want to help people make their information beautiful. The format that we chose for this is infographic because they are concise, usually in one page and the readers understand information in about 1 minute. They stand out from the rest of the visual presentations and give you an edge when you have great numbers to present to a web audience.</p>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Piktochart- Cool Beans Infographic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://piktochart.com/_pk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/product-page-3a.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Piktochart- Cool Beans Infographic""/></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Create Using 3 Simple Steps. In 30 minutes.</strong></h2>
<p>Our editor has been designed to be really simple. It has all the basic features you need in order to create a Piktochart. After you sign in, (1) Select a theme (2) Customize it with colors and fonts (3) Drag and drop! </p>
<p><em><span style=""font-size: large;"">Customer testimonial: ""fantastic for quick infographics, totally 'drag and drop'. The new <span class=""il"">Prezi</span> for sure!""</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Select 1 out of 40+ Professionally Designed Themes (and growing).</strong></h3>
<p>We pride ourselves in the creation of the themes because we work with real companies/people with real data and information and throw the information back and forth to achieve the best design and layout for you. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>Customize Colors and Fonts within 1 Click.</strong></h3>
<p>We select the best fonts from Google Web Fonts that we love. We make it easy for you to switch between colors, with just one click of the mouse. And the fun just began!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Drag and Drop.</strong></h3>
<p>The entire editor works with a drag and drop. If you wanted a new shape, chart, upload your own image, you have to drag and drop everything into the canvas. It's intuitive and fun!</p>

<h2><strong>Where are we now? (We Need Your Help!)</strong></h2>
<p>The current Piktochart is Version 0.5, 2 developers spent 6 months refining the prototype. It works fine for most infographics and presentations, but what about making it cooler - e.g. export it into slide-based-compatible formats? What about adding animation? Expand the library of icons? Adding lots more themes? We are sure we can hear more creative ideas from you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Let's build Piktochart together. </strong></h3>
<p>We are raising $30,000 because we would like to keep developing the app and making a cooler Piktochart version 2.0 a reality. The main building blocks (we estimated the time and then the costs required):</p>
<ul>

Piktochart is a young startup based in Malaysia, and we want to help people make their information beautiful. The format that we chose for this is infographic because they are concise, usually in one page and the readers understand information in about 1 minute. They stand out from the rest of the visual presentations and give you an edge when you have great numbers to present to a web audience.

Create Using 3 Simple Steps. In 30 minutes.
Our editor has been designed to be really simple. It has all the basic features you need in order to create a Piktochart. After you sign in, (1) Select a theme (2) Customize it with colors and fonts (3) Drag and drop! 
Customer testimonial: ""fantastic for quick infographics, totally 'drag and drop'. The new Prezi for sure!""
 
Select 1 out of 40+ Professionally Designed Themes (and growing).
We pride ourselves in the creation of the themes because we work with real companies/people with real data and information and throw the information back and forth to achieve the best design and layout for you. 
 
 
Customize Colors and Fonts within 1 Click.
We select the best fonts from Google Web Fonts that we love. We make it easy for you to switch between colors, with just one click of the mouse. And the fun just began!
 
Drag and Drop.
The entire editor works with a drag and drop. If you wanted a new shape, chart, upload your own image, you have to drag and drop everything into the canvas. It's intuitive and fun!

Where are we now? (We Need Your Help!)
The current Piktochart is Version 0.5, 2 developers spent 6 months refining the prototype. It works fine for most infographics and presentations, but what about making it cooler - e.g. export it into slide-based-compatible formats? What about adding animation? Expand the library of icons? Adding lots more themes? We are sure we can hear more creative ideas from you.
 
Let's build Piktochart together. 
We are raising $30,000 because we would like to keep developing the app and making a cooler Piktochart version 2.0 a reality. The main building blocks (we estimated the time and then the costs required):

Build an interactive version
Add another 10 themes
Launch a print-friendly version

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Story: Real Talk</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, let’s get caught up. It took me a long time to admit it, but Pursuit is a failure.</p>
<p>A lot of you probably saw the Kickstarter campaign and know that I had this idea back in January 2015 that I wanted to start up a watch company. I wanted the company to be centered on the idea of inspiring people to chase after their passions and to live boldly. So with that idea, I jumped right into it, and in October of last year I ran a campaign on Kickstarter that raised $20,000.</p>
<p>The reality of that story was that my campaign didn’t actually raise $20,000. That was my first mistake. I had put in a lot of hard work, lots of late nights, and a lot of hours to get the campaign to where it was. Towards the end of the campaign we were sitting at about $15,000 and I decided that I wasn’t ready to see the project die given how far I’d already come. So with that, I self-funded the last $5,000 to bring us to our goal.</p>
<p>Looking back, I can see now that obviously I should have listened to the market and accepted that given where the campaign was at, it needed to be scrapped, or worked on, or pretty much anything but self-funded.</p>
<p><b>*Lesson #1: Listen to the market</b></p>
<p>My next poor decision was looking at the Kickstarter campaign and thinking:</p>
<p>  “Wow! $15,000 in sales in the first month! I couldn’t imagine not doing <i>at least</i> $3-5K in sales/month moving forward!”</p>
<p>Obviously that assumption was pretty crazy given the amount of momentum that was generated just by friends and family. Again, hindsight is 20/20. Nevertheless, based on that assumption I placed a second order for another 500 watches (the minimum order quantity) out of fear of going out of inventory. I figured I only had enough watches to last me another couple of months, and the lead-time for an order of watches was about a 4-month period. With that, another $17,000 was spent.</p>
<p><b>*Lesson #2: Don’t get ahead of yourself. Be realistic when necessary.</b></p>
<p>So for the next couple months I continued to work on building a website, marketing my site, and just generally figuring out how to make things work. After about 5 months with few more sales coming in, the money ran out and with that; tired, and defeated, I gave up. I didn’t tell myself or anyone else around me that I was giving up on it though. No, I told myself that I was simply taking a break. To date, this has been the most significant, and by far the most public failure of my entire life. In all honesty, I just did not want to admit that to myself. I didn’t want to call it what it was and accept that I had failed. More than anything, it killed me to think that all of my friends and family would know that it was a failure. To be honest, it really fucking sucked that whenever I hadn’t seen someone in a while, one of the first things that would come up would be “Hey! How’s Pursuit going?!”. So I lied. I’d say it was all going well, when really it was all falling down and I just didn’t have it in me to admit that.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that the impact of lying to myself ended there, but unfortunately that wouldn’t be the truth. All this time that I’d been lying to myself and refusing to admit my failure, I’d been telling my manufacturer that I needed more time. I’d tell him that the sales were slow, and that I needed a couple more months before I’d have the money.</p>
<p>I currently owe my manufacturer $12,000 USD that I don’t have. Which is why I’ve turned back to crowd funding and ultimately, why I need you.</p>
<p>Admitting to myself that I had failed was what I needed to do in order to start actually dealing with the impact of my failure.</p>
<p><b>*Lesson #3: Be honest with yourself.</b></p>
<p>The reality is that everyone fails. Failure is as much a part of life as success and honestly, it’s a really great lesson to learn, especially with the message behind Pursuit. It’s important for people to know that “follow your passions” is not some magical solution where life is always sunshine and rainbows. What it means to pursue your passions is that you’re going to fall flat on your face and fail a lot of the time. You’re going to have your ups and your downs just like anyone else will. The thing with that though is that to have tried and failed is a million times better than to never have tried at all. If you never pursue your passions – if you decide to just “play it safe” – you’re not going to have the great, big, massive failures. You just won’t. If you play it safe you really can avoid a lot of the truly massive failures. The other side of that is that you’re never going to have those great, big, huge wins in your life either. When you’re not playing full out in life you simply aren’t going to have any truly massive wins. Your life will just be… ordinary. For some people that might be okay, but that’s not what Pursuit is about. Pursuit is about extraordinary. I am about extraordinary. With the people that I coach, that’s what I want. With the people I’m able to inspire with Pursuit, that’s my goal. To me life is an opportunity, and you only get one shot at it. Why not make it the greatest experience that you could possibly make it? So that’s what I wanted to do with Pursuit and that’s what I <i>still</i> want to do with my life.</p>
<p>What I’ve learned is that Pursuit, as a brand, as a watch company, is not the vehicle through which I’m going to do that, and that’s okay. To me, it’s not about to vehicle; it’s about the outcome. I don’t care how I’m going to do it; I’m going to do it. I’m committed to having an extraordinary life and I’m committed to helping and inspiring others to do the same. I’m going to fall along that path a whole lot more times between now and the day I die, but I’m okay with that. Failure is all just a part of it. That’s something that I really thought I knew. Turns out that it took me losing a <i>whole lot</i> of money before I truly figured that out. About $70,000 all in.</p>
<p><b>*Lesson #4: Failure is not the end. It’s just a part of life.</b></p>
<p>By far the best thing about failure is that you can learn from it. Through failing I’ve learned everything I just poured into this article and I wouldn’t want my money back on any of it.</p>
<p>So that brings us to what this campaign is all about. Right now, I’ve got a job to do. I need to deal with the impact of my failure, and to do so, I need to come up with $12,000 USD as soon as possible. Lucky for you, out of every failure comes an opportunity. One opportunity that has come from this failure is watches. Lots and lots of watches that need to go! So this is my last “Hoorah!” with Pursuit. I’ll be straight up with you, I’m paying my manufacturer $42/pc for these watches, so I’m taking a loss (which I’m used to at this point) and selling them to you for $35. Same great watch, but with the “I need to get myself out of this crushing debt” discount!</p>
<p>I’ve gone to wholesalers, retailers, friends, family, co-workers, and just about anyone else who’ll listen trying to sell these watches and I need your help to go the last couple steps. So whether you’ve got a watch, love it, and want another; or you don’t have one, and want one; this is a pretty great opportunity to treat yourself.</p>
<p>I may have some work to do trying to figure out the e-commerce side of things and trying to work out how to market and sell online, but at the very least I’m more confident than ever that I’ve got a great product. If you want to check out reviews you can see them here.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity here to really say thanks. I don’t know that I’ll ever really be able to thank all of you enough for what you did for me in the first campaign, or the support that you’ve given me all throughout this journey. The truth is I honestly wouldn’t have had any of these experiences, or any of these opportunities to learn and to grow if it hadn’t been for each and every one of you guys who have helped me out along the way. Though it may not look like it right now, every one of you has helped me to pursue my passions and make some of my dreams a reality, so for that, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I wish all of you the best in success and happiness.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

To be honest, it really fucking sucked that whenever I hadn’t seen someone in a while, one of the first things that would come up would be “Hey! How’s Pursuit going?!”. So I lied. I’d say it was all going well, when really it was all falling down and I just didn’t have it in me to admit that.
I wish I could say that the impact of lying to myself ended there, but unfortunately that wouldn’t be the truth. All this time that I’d been lying to myself and refusing to admit my failure, I’d been telling my manufacturer that I needed more time. I’d tell him that the sales were slow, and that I needed a couple more months before I’d have the money.
I currently owe my manufacturer $12,000 USD that I don’t have. Which is why I’ve turned back to crowd funding and ultimately, why I need you.
Admitting to myself that I had failed was what I needed to do in order to start actually dealing with the impact of my failure.
*Lesson #3: Be honest with yourself.
The reality is that everyone fails. Failure is as much a part of life as success and honestly, it’s a really great lesson to learn, especially with the message behind Pursuit. It’s important for people to know that “follow your passions” is not some magical solution where life is always sunshine and rainbows. What it means to pursue your passions is that you’re going to fall flat on your face and fail a lot of the time. You’re going to have your ups and your downs just like anyone else will. The thing with that though is that to have tried and failed is a million times better than to never have tried at all. If you never pursue your passions – if you decide to just “play it safe” – you’re not going to have the great, big, massive failures. You just won’t. If you play it safe you really can avoid a lot of the truly massive failures. The other side of that is that you’re never going to have those great, big, huge wins in your life either. When you’re not playing full out in life you simply aren’t going to have any truly massive wins. Your life will just be… ordinary. For some people that might be okay, but that’s not what Pursuit is about. Pursuit is about extraordinary. I am about extraordinary. With the people that I coach, that’s what I want. With the people I’m able to inspire with Pursuit, that’s my goal. To me life is an opportunity, and you only get one shot at it. Why not make it the greatest experience that you could possibly make it? So that’s what I wanted to do with Pursuit and that’s what I still want to do with my life.
What I’ve learned is that Pursuit, as a brand, as a watch company, is not the vehicle through which I’m going to do that, and that’s okay. To me, it’s not about to vehicle; it’s about the outcome. I don’t care how I’m going to do it; I’m going to do it. I’m committed to having an extraordinary life and I’m committed to helping and inspiring others to do the same. I’m going to fall along that path a whole lot more times between now and the day I die, but I’m okay with that. Failure is all just a part of it. That’s something that I really thought I knew. Turns out that it took me losing a whole lot of money before I truly figured that out. About $70,000 all in.
*Lesson #4: Failure is not the end. It’s just a part of life.
By far the best thing about failure is that you can learn from it. Through failing I’ve learned everything I just poured into this article and I wouldn’t want my money back on any of it.
So that brings us to what this campaign is all about. Right now, I’ve got a job to do. I need to deal with the impact of my failure, and to do so, I need to come up with $12,000 USD as soon as possible. Lucky for you, out of every failure comes an opportunity. One opportunity that has come from this failure is watches. Lots and lots of watches that need to go! So this is my last “Hoorah!” with Pursuit. I’ll be straight up with you, I’m paying my manufacturer $42/pc for these watches, so I’m taking a loss (which I’m used to at this point) and selling them to you for $35. Same great watch, but with the “I need to get myself out of this crushing debt” discount!
I’ve gone to wholesalers, retailers, friends, family, co-workers, and just about anyone else who’ll listen trying to sell these watches and I need your help to go the last couple steps. So whether you’ve got a watch, love it, and want another; or you don’t have one, and want one; this is a pretty great opportunity to treat yourself.
I may have some work to do trying to figure out the e-commerce side of things and trying to work out how to market and sell online, but at the very least I’m more confident than ever that I’ve got a great product. If you want to check out reviews you can see them here.
Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity here to really say thanks. I don’t know that I’ll ever really be able to thank all of you enough for what you did for me in the first campaign, or the support that you’ve given me all throughout this journey. The truth is I honestly wouldn’t have had any of these experiences, or any of these opportunities to learn and to grow if it hadn’t been for each and every one of you guys who have helped me out along the way. Though it may not look like it right now, every one of you has helped me to pursue my passions and make some of my dreams a reality, so for that, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I wish all of you the best in success and happiness.
Until next time,
James

<h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
<p>We wanted to create something versatile and convenient, as more often than not, we're almost always out of the house and rely heavily on our smart devices for news, meetings, fun, etc. We would forget to bring our stylus with us, or it'd keep getting lost in our bag and we'd spent quite a few minutes trying to furiously dig it out. </p>
<p>One day, we looked at a pair of earbuds and our stylus... and a lightbulb went off in our heads. What if we combined the two? And so after numerous product sketches and prototypes, our Smart Dot was born!</p>

in 2012 which draws its inspiration from the nautical world.
The brand became known through its first two models,
the Class Yacht  and the Class Sail. The style of each is distinguished by the
elegance of their faces of precious woods , which are based on boat decks.
Burel marine watches before all.

For the beginning of the year 2014 Burel wanted to
create a new model inspired by nautical instrumentation. For this new model we decided
to keep the precious nautical brand identity taken from the style and use of
materials related to the nautical world . But we also wanted to highlight new time
piece features never before put forth by the brand.  After several months of research and
development ,  we arrived at a successful
model.

We called this new model
the CLASS CAPE.  

In order to offer our new Class Cape as an exclusive,
we decided to launch this new model by creating a crowdfunding campaign .Burel est une jeune maison horlogère française créée en 2012. Elle puise son imagination dans le monde nautique.La marque s'est fait connaitre grâce à ses deux premiers modèles la Class Yacht et Class Sail, dont le style de chacun se distingue par l'élégance de leurs cadrans en bois précieux, qui s'inspirent des ponts de bateau.La vocation de Burel est de créer des montres marine avant
tout.Pour ce début d'année 2014 Burel a
souhaité concevoir un nouveau modèle s'inspirant de l'instrumentation nautique.
 Pour ce nouveau modèle nous
avions la volonté de garder l'identité nautique chère à la marque de part le
style et l'utilisation de matériaux propres au monde nautique. Mais
nous souhaitions aussi mettre en avant de
nouvelles caractéristiques horlogères jusqu'à présent jamais exploité par la
marque. Après plusieurs mois de recherche et développement, nous sommes donc
arrivés à un modèle abouti.Ce nouveau modèle, nous l'avons
baptisé la CLASS CAPEAfin de proposer notre nouvelle Class
Cape en exclusivité, nous avons décidé de lancer ce nouveau modèle en créant
une campagne de crowdfunding.


The Cape class.
The new Burel "" CLASS CAPE "" was inspired by
nautical instrumentation.  It features
compass graphics. Unlike a traditional watch, there are no hands .
Class Cape time
reading is done by a red indicator line 
superimposed on gradations of a carbon disc, as on a compass of navigation
The disk rotates clockwise, the hour and minute digits
are graded from right to left .
La class Cape .La
 nouvelle Burel « CLASS CAPE » s'inspire de l'instrumentation nautique. 
Elle reprend le graphisme du compas de navigation. Contrairement à une 
montre traditionnel, il n'y a pas d'aiguilles.Sur la Class
 Cape lecture de l'heure s'effectue comme sur un compas de navigation, 
c'est-à-dire à l'aide de la ligne de foi rouge qui vient superposer les 
graduations du disque en carbone.Le disque tourne dans le sens horaire, les chiffres des heures et minutes sont donc gradués de droite à gauche.The Burel Class Cape is equipped with a mechanical Swiss ETA 6498 movement  which is reputed to be reliable and robust. The set is dressed in a black sail canvas strap. Like all Burel watches, the Class Cape has an international 2 year warranty.La Burel Class Cape est équipée d'un mouvement mécanique suisse ETA 6498 qui est réputé fiable et robuste. L’ensemble est habillé d’un bracelet en toile de voile noir. Comme toutes les montres Burel, la class Cape a une garantie internationale de 2 ans.
Burel is a young brand already known on the watch
market . We hope to launch this new model  early this year through a crownfunding
campaign so that this will contribute to the development of the new brand.Burel est une jeune marque déjà présente sur le marché horloger. Nous souhaitons en ce début d’année lancer ce nouveau modèle via une campagne de crownfunding afin que ceci contribue au développement de la jeune marque.To give life to the new Class Cape we need your
support. This will allow us to achieve the initial production of the Class Cape. If we raise more than the original budget , we can
produce a larger stock and distribute Class Cape as well as the whole range of
Burel products worldwide.

We offer the opportunity to acquire our new watch as
an exclusive.

Some surprises will be reserved for you if the goal
is reached before time ...

<h1>m-bro wants you to wear clothes.</h1>
<div>But not just any clothes! Our clothes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Who is m-bro?</h3>
<div>m-bro is Gordon Widener &amp; Derek Parrott. We run mbrosatellite.com and have done a variety of panels at anime conventions, a podcast about the same kind of things, and several videos of questionable quality that may not be about anything. We're nerds that sometimes are funny to other nerds. If you self-identify as a video game or anime nerd, you probably would find us kind of amusing. You may already find us amusing; and so here we are.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>About The Shirt</h3>
<div>Having been around conventions for almost ten years we have things to say about it. But since we can't walk around with you all day and make jokes about the convention, we decided to put a new joke in garment form. Something that rings true to anyone, anywhere, if you've ever stayed at a hotel during a nerd convention...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The elevators break. They get stuffed. And there are never, ever enough of them. This shirt is for those brave con warriors who know better than to wait over an hour for an elevator, especially when there's an angry Barret cosplayer with a real metal gun-arm, and he is determined to get on first.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These t-shirts will be printed on Tultex 0202 Cotton Short Sleeve shirts. They're a great deep red called Cardinal. Dare I say they look regal. The shirt stock is very similar to American Apparel, so you can expect a vintage-style fit. We are having them printed at VGKids, a local screenprinting house in Ypsilanti.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making a shirt isn't free, and we need help. We want to make at least 50 of these and we want to sell them at Youmacon 2011. We want people to already be wearing them when we get there. We want them to be quality and we want you to be happy with them. Ideally, we want to be able to come up with more clever shirts, stickers, magnets and other stuff that speaks to a group that still isn't very well-represented: the nerdy congoer who is a little more refined than shouting The Game in a crowded room.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $320 to get started. Our $320 goal wasn't just set on a dartboard - it's the number of orders we need to make 50 shirts. This is purely, solely the cost of the shirts; it doesn't cover setup costs we may incur nor does it cover any of our con-related expenses. </p>
<p>If we go over that? We'll use it to make more shirts and/or put it towards a dealer's hall table. </p>
<p>If we don't hit the goal - as long as we're over $160 we'll be able to do shirts for our contributors but won't be able to go past that. If we are under $160, we'll be putting the money into our giveaways for our panels and also for hosting costs for our website and podcast (it's not free!) ...and we'll still be doing pins that you'll get too.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So what's in it for you? Everyone who throws money in will get a shoutout on mbrosatellite.com! But you have to give us at least $20 to get a shirt. Up to 50 preorders are going to include an exclusive 1"" pin which will never, ever be offered anywhere else ever, or even made again! You get the shoutout too! Give us $25 and you get a shirt, the exclusive pin, the shoutout, AND our first 1"" pin set (4 pins total, not counting the preorder pin) - which we'll be unveiling here very soon! </p>
<p>Want to go bigger? Ok. At $40 you'll get everything already listed plus if you have Skype, you can guest on an episode of our podcast! And at $50 - get everything above, plus a handwritten thank you note AND - you'll get an incredibly rare copy of the super-secret ""m-bro Homecoming Photo""! These will only ever exist for those who give over $50, will never be produced ever again ever, and their existence will be denied! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All physical items will be able to be picked up at Youmacon or shipping in time to arrive by Youmacon. (We expect to ship them earlier, but need to see what the turnaround time will be exactly.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Send your friends here! And also to mbrosatellite.com, our Twitter and Facebook! Tell them about our panels, play an episode of our podcast for them! Going to Youmacon? Bring your friends to our panels, and get on the youmacon.com forums and tell us why you're excited for our stuff! Email us suggestions - We want to talk to you!</p>
<p>And keep checking back here for updates!<br/></p>

<p>Greetings!  I am Fashion Designer, Niiamar Felder.  And with your support I will present a spectacular Spring 2013 collection at New York Fashion Week in September!  That said, allow me to share the following information about my life and my love of fashion design.</p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT NIIAMAR</strong></h3>
<p>Inspired by the brilliance of <strong>Valentino,</strong> NIIAMAR avoids trends in favor of a more enduring style that has become the signature of his coveted designs.  His designs have been featured in several publications, fashion shows, theatre productions and national marketing campaigns.  He was nominated for the notable <strong>Marvin Sims Design Fellowship</strong> in Costume Design awarded by the <strong>Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts</strong>. While completing his undergraduate degree, he worked as a Design Assistant to renowned designer <strong>Kevan Hall</strong> in 2006.  Niiamar received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU) in 2007. </p>
<p>In addition to designing stunning collections each season, Niiamar’s designs have been worn by Hollywood personalities to red carpet events, including the <strong>Academy Awards</strong>. Niiamar’s growing list of accomplishments include:  a feature in <strong><em>EBONY</em> </strong>Magazine; presentation of his spring collection during NYC Fashion Week in 2010; featured designer at the 2011 Women Who Care Luncheon.  As a contestant on Lifetime's <strong>""24 Hour Catwalk""</strong>, Niiamar impressed the panel of celebrity judges with his attention to detail and exceptional design aesthetics.  He has served as Principal Costume Designer for the off Broadway productions of <strong>“The Doll Confessions”</strong> directed by Tony Award Winner <strong>Trezana Beverley</strong> and Cole Porter’s <strong>“Kiss Me Kate.”</strong></p>
<p>Please visit my web site <a href=""http://www.niiamar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.niiamar.com</a> to view my collections and learn more about my journey into the world of fashion.  It is my hope that you will be even more inspired to make a donation.</p>
<p><strong>What (funding) I need and where it's going.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Over the years producing a fashion line has become increasingly expensive and this collection will cost about $20,000 which is a fairly low cost. All of the proceedes raised will be used wisely to purchase fabric, cost of seamstress/pattern sample maker, *(creating the actual 2D designs) hair stylist and make up artist, models, press, and other miscellanous cost that will go directly into producing the Spring 2013 presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Where the funds will go if I don't reach my entire goal</strong></p>
<p>If the $20,000 goal is not reached ( though I am optimistic that we will) the funds raised will still be used to support the efforts in producing the Spring 2013 Presentation. We are also using other fundraising methods to ensure that we reach our expected finanical goal. The show must go on!</p>
<p><strong>The signifigance of presenting my spring collection at NYC Fashion Week in September  </strong></p>
<p>Fashion is one of the most universal ways to express who you are, without saying a word. And to express you in great style and luxury makes it even better.  This project has the potential to launch me, a true talented designer phenom and brand into the forefront of the fashion world and most importantly introducing more diversity which is needed in the fashion industry.  It is not only my desire to become the first Black American to show couture collections in Paris, but I ultimately want to continue in my passion in a greater way, and that is nurturing and educating the next generations of designers.  YOU giving to this project will not only assist me, but also others to continue in the passion of creating beautiful and timeless fashion.</p>
<p>Please join me in making this happen!  And you may do so in more than one way...donate, post to your faceook page and share this information with your friends too (see the Indiegogo share tools for facebook, twitter, etc.)  With your support I can realize my dream to my first exclusive show at NEW YORK FASHION WEEK in September! Thank you and God bless!</p>

<h2>The story of BusyBasket TM</h2>
<p>My name is Diana, I live in Zagreb, Croatia, Europe, I am a professional journalist,  book and screenplay writer, award-winning innovator and the owner of the Jupiteriana, company for inventing of new products. I like to think up new things in various areas of creativity.</p>
<h3>But the main role here plays BusyBasket, my innovation, so here is the story:</h3>
<p>The Idea to innovate BusyBasket came to me when I myself have experienced a problem known  to all cyclists – how to carry a larger bag on the bike, like laptop bag, briefcase, school bag, sport bag, grocery bag... I ride my bike to work every day, of course, carying my laptop. If I wear it on the handlebar, it hinders while driving, on the shoulder it disturbs the balance, and I cannot even think of carrying something so valuable on the rear rack! Soon, I noticed that others were having this problem also. The same happens with the suitcases and other large bags or packages.</p>
<p>As I could not find any basket that would solve this problem I created it myself. The realization of my idea and creating a new product went like this: first there were sketches on my table, then first model in my garage, and then a dozen prototypes in the workshop of a local craftsman. When I presented my innovation in my cycling association, and to my friends who liked it very much, I was overjoyed, so I named it BusyBasket, registrated as industrial design and presented it at two international innovation shows.  I won two gold medals! Feedback was excellent and I belive that my innovation could have a bright future!</p>
<p>After that I gathered a team, all cycling enthusiasts and we started with a first small serial production. That is how the first generation of BusyBasket was created which I am presenting you here.</p>
<p>I have been able to cover the expanses of the industrial design process, legal fees, prototyping and first tooling and manufacturing by myself.</p>
<p>Our wish is to develop BusyBasket further. Our design and marketing team plan to develop a second generation of BusyBasket which will have even better design that will be more suitable for mass production. We also plan to present BusyBasket to the world market.</p>
<p>And that is why we need your financial help!</p>
<p>We have prepared a limited amount of first generation BusyBasket carrier, and other great perks with BusyBasket logo. Please support our project and enable us to continue developing BusyBasket which will benefit and help all cyclists – and there is more of us every day! :-)</p>
<h3>You can also help very much by forwarding the link of this project to your friends cyclists, bike associations and clubs... and anyone that you think might be interested!</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106);""><i>Sourcing the Fibre</i></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106);"">The initial challenge was to find a <b>reliable source</b> of quality qiviut that could supply in <b>commercial quantity</b>. To date and as mentioned, qiviut has been used only on a small scale for spinning into yarn sold to home hobbyists who knit a garment by hand. Until now, no one had ever attempted to use it for mass manufacturing even on a limited edition basis. Typically, qiviut can only be <b>sourced once a year</b> in late winter/early spring when the musk oxen molt or are allowed to be hunted for meat under strict government control, primarily by subsistence natives who then sell off the hides for fur harvesting. It is definitely a cottage industry process and, therefore, inefficient and costly. But it is the only way to source the fibre. In Alaska, having the smallest number of Musk Ox, there was no commercial source of supply but I was lucky enough to find two dedicated qiviut processors, one in northern Canada, home to the world's largest population of wild Musk Ox, and the other in western Greenland.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The next part of the process was finding the expertise and craftsmen who could properly integrate the fibre into a manufacturing process. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>High Performance Insulation Without Bulk</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For example, let's talk about <b>insulation</b>. Almost all other luxury high performance outerwear use <b>feathers or synthetics</b> or a combination of both to insulate against the cold. These materials lend themselves to a mechanized process because they can be <b>laid in or blown into</b> the insulating cavity (between the outer shell and inner lining) of a garment. When using hair, particularly hair as fine as qiviut, there is no automated way to fill the insulation cavity. Through a lot of trial and error, our specialized manufacturing facility came up with <b>the 'sandwich' method of insulation</b>: laying the Musk Ox hair <i>by hand</i>  between two layers of ThermolitePro™ high performance synthetic. This maximizes warmth while minimizing bulk (to avoid the 'Michelin Man look').</p>

</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">A similar challenge was locating the right vendor who could handle the spinning of the ultra-fine qiviut fibre with luxury grade Super Fine Merino wool and King Baby  Alpaca to make the bespoke yarn that would allow the jacket's knitted arctic collar and trim to have the sensuous hand feel that only this unique mixture can yield while still providing a snugness and thermal performance to protect against the most severe wind and cold. This I was able to do in England using an established family owned firm in Cornwall specializing in small batch yarn spinning. The bespoke yarn then went to an artisan knitting facility in Leicester for completion of the trim and then to a century old fabric finishing facility in Huddersfield  before being sent for final assembly matching up the trim with the jacket shell.<p><br/></p>

<div>As mentioned above and unlike most people who crowdfund, I am <i>not</i> using Indiegogo to raise money to manufacture or for working capital equity. The effort to bring <b>The Qiviut Jacket</b> to market has been entirely self-funded and the jackets will be available for fulfillment almost immediately at the beginning of February. What I do need your help for is to establish the viability of qiviut products in the luxury end of the fashion market at luxury price points. I believe that selling 500 of a single qiviut item this winter will do that. In other words, it will provide <b>a successful proof of concept</b> that will lay the groundwork in all sorts of ways to establish the brand and a completely new category in luxury fashion. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">And that is why selling <b>the first 100 jackets</b> on Indiegogo is so important. It will provide initial traction, stimulate a media/social network buzz and create some name recognition faster than any other sales methodology, at least for a start-up with limited marketing resources. <br/></span></div>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106);""><h3>Return and Exchange Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Returns:</strong><br/>Our return policy is quite simple: You can return a jacket in its original condition (unworn and undamaged with all original packaging and garment tags)  at any time within 30 days of purchase for a full refund, no questions asked. Returns are accomplished by contacting us by e-mail at <a href=""mailto:concierge@qiviutandco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>concierge</i><i>@qi</i><i>viutandco.com</i></a>  for a <b>Returns/Exchange Form</b> or by downloading it <i><a href=""http://qiviut.housedev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Return_Exchange_Form.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://qiviut.housedev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Return_Exchange_Form.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </i>We aim to respond within 24 hours with detailed return instructions. Refunds can only be made by crediting the original purchaser’s form of payment. </p>
<p><strong>Exchanges:</strong><br/>Exchanges may also be requested within 30 days of purchase by the same e-mail process but are a bit more complicated because of the numbering and registration of each jacket and the limited availability of sizes. A jacket once numbered on a Certificate of Authenticity always retains its 1-500 number but is linked in our database to a unique serial number on the garment. The jacket number will be permanently referenced to the initial buyer or his or her designee. However, the serial number to which the jacket number is linked will change upon an exchange and a new Certificate of Authenticity issued. While we will always try to accommodate exchanges insofar as possible, because of the limited edition of <strong>The Qiviut Jacket</strong> a desired size may not be available. Where a satisfactory exchange cannot be accomplished a full refund will be made by crediting the original purchaser’s form of payment. Please download the <a href=""http://qiviut.housedev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Return_Exchange_Form.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Returns/Exchange Form</a> and send the completed form to <i><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""concierge@qiviutandco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""concierge@qiviutandco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""concierge@qiviutandco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">concierge@qiviutandco.com</a></i>.</p>

<h3>Shipping Information</h3>
<p>For this proof of concept effort involving just 500 of <strong>The Qiviut Jacket</strong>, we are offering <b>free shipping</b> but selling only to destinations in North America and Western Europe (see <strong><a href=""http://qiviut.housedev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/qiviut_map1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">complete list of countries here</a></strong>).</p>

For all shipments of <b>The Qiviut Jacket </b>in the <b>United Kingdom</b> we use <b>DPD</b> as our designated shipper. For the <b>rest of the world</b> we use <b>DHL</b>. Both companies offer end to end tracking service and you can be notified by e-mail or text of the status of your order. Once jackets are in stock delivery time to all UK destinations is typically 1-2 business days and for other destinations 2-5 business days. All shipments require a signature upon delivery.</p>
<p>In the event of a return or exchange, shipping is also <b>free</b> from the above mentioned areas of the world, or payable by buyer from elsewhere, and can be initiated  by contacting us by e-mail at <i><a href=""mailto:concierge@qiviutandco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">concierge@qiviutandco.com</a></i> or by completing and submitting a <a href=""http://qiviut.housedev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Return_Exchange_Form.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Return/Exchange Form</a>. We aim to reply within 24 hours with detailed return or exchange instructions.</p>
<h3>Sizing Information</h3>
<div>The only variable in <b>The Qiviut Jacket</b> is size and because exchanges are expensive for us and inconvenient for customers, we want to make sure that our Founding Funders select the correct size as much as they do. Therefore, please consult our size chart, measurement specifications and measurement instructions here before selecting your size. Taking the time to verify your measurements against those of the size jacket you order will help ensure receiving the correct size jacket straight away and minimize the potential disappointment of an an unsuccessful exchange for a different size that may no longer be available.</div>

</div> . _ .</div>","A Musk Ox, A Cashmere Goat and a Vicuna Walk Into A Bar ...


Deadly. Actually, despite its name Musk Ox are part of the goat family. They are prehistoric mammals that roamed the arctic regions of the planet with mastodons and wooly mammoths during the Pleistocene Era and survived the Ice Age. Today, Musk Ox can be found in significant numbers in only three places: Alaska, northern Canada and Greenland, all among the most inhospitable winter climates on earth. 
The Musk Ox's ability to survive in such conditions is largely due to the phenomenal insulating capability of its hair. At the same time, this protective hair is finer than cashmere resulting, when knitted or woven, in a fabric that is unparalleled in hand feel. This campaign will bring these incredible qualities to a select few Founding Funders who support the creation of a jacket and, ultimately, the creation of a complete luxury fashion line like no other.

The Origin
 The Qiviut Jacket began its history in Alaska where I lived for twenty years after growing up in New York City. Alaska is truly a wonderful place, known as much for its natural beauty and abundant wildlife as it is for its harsh winters and sub-zero temperatures. It was because of these latter conditions, however, that I first became aware of Musk Ox and how suitable their hair was for arctic temperatures.

The use of qiviut to this point in time has been exclusively to spin it into yarn for sale to home hobbyists who hand knit the occasional sweater, scarf, beanie, etc. However, what works for musk oxen should work for humans on a larger scale and I explored using this remarkable fibre as the basis for a clothing line in Alaska but quickly realized it would be too expensive for that market and abandoned the idea.

 Fast forward ten years, during which time the internet has made global marketing a reality, and I am now living in London, one of the great fashion capitals of the world. The stars had aligned to resurrect the idea of creating a brand of luxury garments based upon the use of qiviut and the past 18 months have been spent doing just that. 






Sourcing the Fibre
The initial challenge was to find a reliable source of quality qiviut that could supply in commercial quantity. To date and as mentioned, qiviut has been used only on a small scale for spinning into yarn sold to home hobbyists who knit a garment by hand. Until now, no one had ever attempted to use it for mass manufacturing even on a limited edition basis. Typically, qiviut can only be sourced once a year in late winter/early spring when the musk oxen molt or are allowed to be hunted for meat under strict government control, primarily by subsistence natives who then sell off the hides for fur harvesting. It is definitely a cottage industry process and, therefore, inefficient and costly. But it is the only way to source the fibre. In Alaska, having the smallest number of Musk Ox, there was no commercial source of supply but I was lucky enough to find two dedicated qiviut processors, one in northern Canada, home to the world's largest population of wild Musk Ox, and the other in western Greenland.



The next part of the process was finding the expertise and craftsmen who could properly integrate the fibre into a manufacturing process. 
High Performance Insulation Without Bulk
For example, let's talk about insulation. Almost all other luxury high performance outerwear use feathers or synthetics or a combination of both to insulate against the cold. These materials lend themselves to a mechanized process because they can be laid in or blown into the insulating cavity (between the outer shell and inner lining) of a garment. When using hair, particularly hair as fine as qiviut, there is no automated way to fill the insulation cavity. Through a lot of trial and error, our specialized manufacturing facility came up with the 'sandwich' method of insulation: laying the Musk Ox hair by hand  between two layers of ThermolitePro™ high performance synthetic. This maximizes warmth while minimizing bulk (to avoid the 'Michelin Man look').









Spinning, Knitting and Finishing - All in England
A similar challenge was locating the right vendor who could handle the spinning of the ultra-fine qiviut fibre with luxury grade Super Fine Merino wool and King Baby  Alpaca to make the bespoke yarn that would allow the jacket's knitted arctic collar and trim to have the sensuous hand feel that only this unique mixture can yield while still providing a snugness and thermal performance to protect against the most severe wind and cold. This I was able to do in England using an established family owned firm in Cornwall specializing in small batch yarn spinning. The bespoke yarn then went to an artisan knitting facility in Leicester for completion of the trim and then to a century old fabric finishing facility in Huddersfield  before being sent for final assembly matching up the trim with the jacket shell.


The final major piece of the puzzle was securing design talent that could envision a luxury jacket worthy of the name. Luckily, such talent exists in abundance in London as one of the fashion capitals of the world and the result is an understated, elegant and versatile garment that is equally at home on the slopes St Moritz or the platforms of St Pancras.















This campaign is the precursor to the roll-out of a full line of qiviut clothing for AW 2016-17 (think sweaters, scarves, gilets, vests, etc.). Money raised in this campaign will help fund the acquisition of raw materials, design development and the expanded infrastructure necessary to make, market and fulfill a QIVIUT & CO Concept Line, all in limited edition men's and women's garments and accessories, online only, direct to consumer. 


How You Can Help
As mentioned above and unlike most people who crowdfund, I am not using Indiegogo to raise money to manufacture or for working capital equity. The effort to bring The Qiviut Jacket to market has been entirely self-funded and the jackets will be available for fulfillment almost immediately at the beginning of February. What I do need your help for is to establish the viability of qiviut products in the luxury end of the fashion market at luxury price points. I believe that selling 500 of a single qiviut item this winter will do that. In other words, it will provide a successful proof of concept that will lay the groundwork in all sorts of ways to establish the brand and a completely new category in luxury fashion. 
And that is why selling the first 100 jackets on Indiegogo is so important. It will provide initial traction, stimulate a media/social network buzz and create some name recognition faster than any other sales methodology, at least for a start-up with limited marketing resources.

Why such a generous Perks scheme? It's simple. I want to show my appreciation for the  select few early adopters who are willing to place their faith in my concept and want to be part of a new, exclusive brand from the very beginning. The 100 Founding Funders will provide credibility, media attention and momentum to fuel the sale of the remaining jackets which, in turn, will help establish the brand as a full line next year. It's a straightforward business model.
The PerksI also don't want to overlook people who can't be Founding Funders but still want to support the concept and be involved with the project. So, hopefully, one of the other rewards will be appealing, unique and show my appreciation as good value for money. So, here are the Perks to which you can subscribe:The Qiviut JacketThis will always be our flagship quilted garment in the QIVIUT & CO line. A superbly crafted jacket consisting of a water and stain resistant polyester outer shell insulated with a mixture of 100% Canadian qiviut, musk ox guard hair and Thermolite Pro™ synthetic, trimmed with a knitted mixture of Greenland qiviut, alpaca and superfine merino wool.

FAQs
A full range of FAQs can be found on the QIVIUT & CO website but let me highlight three of the most important:
Return and Exchange Policy
Returns:Our return policy is quite simple: You can return a jacket in its original condition (unworn and undamaged with all original packaging and garment tags)  at any time within 30 days of purchase for a full refund, no questions asked. Returns are accomplished by contacting us by e-mail at concierge@qiviutandco.com  for a Returns/Exchange Form or by downloading it here. We aim to respond within 24 hours with detailed return instructions. Refunds can only be made by crediting the original purchaser’s form of payment. 
Exchanges:Exchanges may also be requested within 30 days of purchase by the same e-mail process but are a bit more complicated because of the numbering and registration of each jacket and the limited availability of sizes. A jacket once numbered on a Certificate of Authenticity always retains its 1-500 number but is linked in our database to a unique serial number on the garment. The jacket number will be permanently referenced to the initial buyer or his or her designee. However, the serial number to which the jacket number is linked will change upon an exchange and a new Certificate of Authenticity issued. While we will always try to accommodate exchanges insofar as possible, because of the limited edition of The Qiviut Jacket a desired size may not be available. Where a satisfactory exchange cannot be accomplished a full refund will be made by crediting the original purchaser’s form of payment. Please download the Returns/Exchange Form and send the completed form to concierge@qiviutandco.com.

But each came with their own distinct advantages and limitations. We love merino because soft and handles moisture well, but becomes unstable after heavy use Synthetic fibres are more durable and wicking efficient but can't match the next to skin comfort as merino.And the problem mixing both yarns causes an overall reduction on the inherent benefits and performance. And when we came across Polartec PowerWool we knew we had found the perfect base layer fabric.By bypassing traditional retail and selling to you online we able to offer you significant discounts.

<b>The Problem:</b><br/>
</h2><p><i><b>Weather protection</b></i> is one of the biggest industries in the world and one of the most important facets of daily life. It consumes the news and determines what we will wear or bring with us everyday when we leave our home.<br/></p><p>We can land a rover on a comet and design an ultra thin smart phone but we are still relying on <i><b>two antiquated products</b></i> for our complete weather protection needs -- the<i> <b>umbrella </b></i>and the <i><b>raincoat &amp; hood!</b></i></p><p>Let's face it our current weather protection gear ---<i><b> just isn't doing the job!</b><br/></i></p><p>Although the umbrella is most widely known for inverting it is not the biggest problem. The major drawback with the umbrella is; <b><i>You Have to Hold It!</i></b></p><p>And for our only current hands-free solution<i>; the raincoat</i> --- well most would agree it is a far cry from an acceptable one. It <b><i>provides  limited protection</i></b> at best and doesn't provide any protection for anything you are holding or using; i.e phone, 
camera etc...</p><p>Most everyone can imagine a time they wished they had a <i>true hands-free umbrella</i> whether working or just doing everyday basic activities.</p><p><br/></p><h3>                          <b>Are you tired of this?<br/></b>

</h3><br/><br/><br/><h2><b>The Solution!</b></h2><br/><h4><i><b>An Idea is Born!</b></i></h4><p><i><i>Several years ago while 
sitting in a coffee shop in NYC on a miserable rainy windy day I began 
to take notice of how everyone was struggling with their umbrella. I 
also noticed the faces of those working who were relying merely on a 
raincoat. It was at that moment an image appeared in my mind of what an 
alternative weather  protection device/umbrella should look like. I ran 
to a desk and sketched it.</i></i></p><p><i><i>                                                                                                <b><i>Alan Kaufman -- Founder</i></b></i></i></p><p><br/></p><h3><i><i><b><i>Introducing Nubrella</i></b></i></i></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1023882/files/20141117141605-nubrella_logo_main.jpg?1416262565"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>""Nubrella is a <i><b>breakthrough product innovation</b></i>.

<b>        Final streamlined look of Nubrella (yet clear panel stops at eye level)</b><br/>
</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>How It Works:</h3><br/>Nubrella is designed to be conveniently <i><b>worn backpack style</b></i> and simply <i><b>function like a hood going back and forth </b></i>when needed.<br/><br/>When not with the simple press of a button the canopy springs back behind you and stores down you back like a hood --  <b><i>eliminating the need to carry anything!</i></b><br/><br/>With Nubrella's patented clever extended aerodynamic canopy wind simply flows over and around the canopy <i><b>completely denying any ability to invert.</b></i> We have also designed the canopy to be very stabilized to manage strong winds.<br/><br/>In addition Nubrella has extended out the coverage in the front <i>to cover the use of <b>smart phones </b>and <b>tablets.</b></i><br/><br/> Finally with with extended coverage on the sides and rear it blocks wind chill <i><b>keeping the user significantly warmer!</b> Nubrella is ideal for a snowstorm -- go ahead and shovel or walk and be completely protected...<br/></i><br/><br/><br/><h3>Where &amp; When?<br/>
</h3>Yet to fully understand Nubrella and its value propositions it is designed for those who<i> <b>have to be outdoors for extended periods of time</b></i>  whether working or just doing everyday basic activities. It is not designed to replace your traditional umbrella to run tot the car or other very simple uses......<br/><br/>With this said with feedback from the customer and our own study we have identified over <i><b>100 applications/usages</b></i> in the commercial and recreational fields. <br/><br/>Here are just a few;<br/><br/><h4>

The Problem:
Weather protection is one of the biggest industries in the world and one of the most important facets of daily life. It consumes the news and determines what we will wear or bring with us everyday when we leave our home.We can land a rover on a comet and design an ultra thin smart phone but we are still relying on two antiquated products for our complete weather protection needs -- the umbrella and the raincoat & hood!Let's face it our current weather protection gear --- just isn't doing the job!Although the umbrella is most widely known for inverting it is not the biggest problem. The major drawback with the umbrella is; You Have to Hold It!And for our only current hands-free solution; the raincoat --- well most would agree it is a far cry from an acceptable one. It provides  limited protection at best and doesn't provide any protection for anything you are holding or using; i.e phone, 
camera etc...Most everyone can imagine a time they wished they had a true hands-free umbrella whether working or just doing everyday basic activities.                          Are you tired of this?
                                                                                                                                                      Sun protection!             If so, then you are going to love this!
The Solution!An Idea is Born!Several years ago while 
sitting in a coffee shop in NYC on a miserable rainy windy day I began 
to take notice of how everyone was struggling with their umbrella. I 
also noticed the faces of those working who were relying merely on a 
raincoat. It was at that moment an image appeared in my mind of what an 
alternative weather  protection device/umbrella should look like. I ran 
to a desk and sketched it.                                                                                                Alan Kaufman -- FounderIntroducing Nubrella""Nubrella is a breakthrough product innovation. It is a Hands-Free, Inversion Proof -- new weather protection device conveniently worn backpack style!"" Nubrella launched it's initial 'bubble"" like model which was presented on the hit TV show Shark Tank. But the Shark's were a little too greedy so we didn't end up doing a deal.Although this design was successfully sold in 82 countries with significant feedback it became very apparent we needed return to the design table. Customers around the world loved the hands-free but found being fully enclosed in bubble was; overkill protection, did not allow for communication with others, impaired vision and was a bit 'dorky' looking. And we agreed!So Nubrella was redesigned and we met all of our design goals and more!Our new model is being hailed as; The Ultimate User-Friendly backpack style worn open-front Hands-Free & Wind-Resistant umbrella design.Our new design provides protection against; rain, snow, wind and sun! Millions still hold an umbrella to block the sun. Nubrella finally offers these users a hands-free solution as well eliminating the tiresome act of having to hold an umbrella and offers far superior protection over a hat.Nubrella could be the next ""MUST HAVE ITEM"" -- added to your current arsenal of weather protection gear and apparel.                                            
        Final streamlined look of Nubrella (yet clear panel stops at eye level)
How It Works:Nubrella is designed to be conveniently worn backpack style and simply function like a hood going back and forth when needed.When not with the simple press of a button the canopy springs back behind you and stores down you back like a hood --  eliminating the need to carry anything!With Nubrella's patented clever extended aerodynamic canopy wind simply flows over and around the canopy completely denying any ability to invert. We have also designed the canopy to be very stabilized to manage strong winds.In addition Nubrella has extended out the coverage in the front to cover the use of smart phones and tablets. Finally with with extended coverage on the sides and rear it blocks wind chill keeping the user significantly warmer! Nubrella is ideal for a snowstorm -- go ahead and shovel or walk and be completely protected...Where & When?
Yet to fully understand Nubrella and its value propositions it is designed for those who have to be outdoors for extended periods of time  whether working or just doing everyday basic activities. It is not designed to replace your traditional umbrella to run tot the car or other very simple uses......With this said with feedback from the customer and our own study we have identified over 100 applications/usages in the commercial and recreational fields. Here are just a few;
Recreational:

Riding a bike/scooter to work or school
Standing at a Parade(Macy's), speech/rally, in a long line (Apple store)
Walking the dog(s)
Tailgating at major sporting event (NASCAR, NCAA, MLS, NFL etc..)

Using a wheelchair/crutches/scooter/ Segway
Hiking, fishing, hunting, walking for exercise
Pushing the stroller, soccer mom who wants to text and drink coffee
Commuters waiting for bus or train
Shoveling snow
Sun protection

Commercial:
Delivering the mail, crossing guard, meter maid(ticket)
Professional photographer

TV Cameraman
Security Personnel

At Disney or other theme park

Construction workers
Surveyors
Scientist/Biologist/Geologist
Agricultural workers/landscaping
Airport ground crew
News, Sports & Weather reporters
Sizes & ColorNubrella will launch with a one size fits 
all. Nubrella can be adjusted with the straps for a comfort fit. adjustable with the backpack straps so it should fit most 
all. Nubrella plans several other sizes in the near future, i.e children, extra large...Initially Nubrella will have a UV sun reflective black waterproof material. Yet, as seen in  the illustration Nubrella will have one clear panel in front for perfect vision and the sides clear for excellent peripheral vision. With a minimum quantity order Nubrella can be made of any color. design or logo/branding; i.e. camouflage, Nike, pink etc....

Is this Revolutionary?
Well, we will leave that up to you, but we certainly think so! Why? Because we are delivering a solution to a huge unmet
 need in the market.Everyone can imagine a time they wished they had a  real Hands-Free umbrella. The Timing couldn't be better!We now live in a technological society where everyone is completely dependent upon smart phones and tablets  both in the workplace and recreationally. More than ever we need our hands-free and our devices protected!  With Nubrella go ahead and use your I-Pad as a Terminix employee. Or watch your child play soccer while taking a video or drinking your coffee and talk, or walk to school or work and text away....Nubrella is poised to change weather protection forever. Finally people will have an alternative product to turn to that offers far superior protection over the raincoat and relives those tired arms from having to hold up an umbrella.Major News:  
Nubrella is extremely proud to announce we have just been granted a Utility Patent in the US and have filed our PCT applications providing international protection. This is a significant milestone for the company. 
Nubrella now owns the only patent in the world for a true 'wearable' Hands-Free umbrella! Other Models/Accessories:Nubrella-PackFor those who require a backpack with their Nubrella, we have designed a custom Nubrella backpack in the rear. Once you get where your going --- snap it off and you have a full standard backpack.Why Our backpack?Due to Nubrella's extensive engineering for stability and fit to add a backpack it needed certain weight and size dimensions to attach to Nubrella. So your own backpack simply won't work.Yet, we will be offering our backpack as an accessory at a considerable discount vs. the same backpack you would purchase in a store.                                      (simulation may vary in size and color)Nubrella Sport: Coming soon
A streamlined version for use inside sport stadiums around the world. Nubrella will be working with the NFL, NASCAR, World Soccer Federation and the NCAA to get approved for use inside the stadium and have your favorite team logo or driver on the rear. Also Coming soon -- Nubrella KidsParents will love Nubrella kids. There are no sharp points or rods that can be considered dangerous. Also because it is worn much less chance of them losing it.Finally coming soon - Nubrella MobileWe will be adding Bluetooth wireless technology so you can communicate or listen to music completely Hands-Free as well.                           We ask; ""what would you rather do?""USE OF PROCEEDSYour contribution will allow us to complete the tooling process - approximately 60 days. Once completed samples will be approved and we will be ready for immediate manufacturing. We plan to have Nubrellas in your hands (or should we say no hands needed) in early 2015 March-April.  We already have many prepaid customers waiting and many others on a list to be contacted once our new design is ready. The retail price for Nubrella will be $99.99. I can assure it it is worth it and we will guarantee it for life!We also have many Fortune 1000 companies, international resellers, the largest on-line retailers, mass retailers and major media all waiting release and samples. It's been a long road
I personally have invested hundreds of thousand of dollars along with some friends and family to bring Nubrella to where it is today. In addition I have dedicated and sacrificed 11 years of my life committed to bringing change to this overlooked industry.Many said it couldn't be done and only companies can bring such innovation to market. Well I have turned the non-believers into believers.I now just need a little help from you to get Nubrella's new design over the finish line and take the world by storm! Weather protection is ripe for innovation. This industry has remained overlooked far too long.With a pledge you can be part of the Nubrella story. In return for your gracious support we are going to offer you the ability to purchase one or more now at a considerable discount ($49 down from $99.99 - a 50% savings) With your purchase you will be guaranteed to get one first from our initial production run even though we are already oversold with other sign ups. So you will be the envy of all your friends, family and the unknown...

Le Cercle des Parfumeurs Créateurs  accueille un nouveau membre


Jean-Christophe Hérault

Jean-Christophe a grandi dans les coulisses de la fabrication de parfums, son père produisant des concentrés de parfums. Adolescent, ce dernier lui offre Joop for Men. « C'était la première fois que
je tombais amoureux d’un parfum. » se souvient Jean-Christophe.
Durant ses études de chimie, il effectue un stage à Grasse au cours duquel il est fasciné par les champs de mimosa et par les absolues de jasmin et de tubéreuse.
Formé par Pierre Bourdon, le créateur de Joop for Men  et lui-même élève d'Edmond Roudnitska (le créateur d'Eau Sauvage de Dior), Jean-Christophe développe rapidement son propre langage olfactif et prend en notes ce que chaque matière première évoque en lui.
Convaincu que l’audace et la créativité sont les clés de la parfumerie de demain, Jean-Christophe Héraut s’efforce d’imaginer des parfums qui réveillent en
chacun de fortes émotions.
Ses créations précédentes :


Florabotanica - Balenciaga 


Rosabotanica - Balenciaga 


Karl Lagerfeld for Him - Karl Lagerfeld 


Amazingreen - Comme des Garçons  



Sa création pour Le Cercle des Parfumeurs Créateurs : Osmanthée 



Osmanthus Fragrans, appelé aussi Olivier de Chine

""J’ai toujours voulu créer une fragrance autour de l’osmanthus. 
C'est une fleur très intéressante, à la fois délicate et fraîche. 
On y devine le parfum doux et propre d’un abricot juteux et de la fleur de jasmin, ainsi que des facettes légèrement cuirées et théinées.
Je voudrais exprimer dans ce parfum la délicatesse et la légèreté de la fleur tout en soulignant son caractère chaleureux et sensuel."" 

Avec votre soutien, Le Cercle des Parfumeurs Créateurs
rendra accessible à tous cette magnifique création de Jean-Christophe
Hérault.

Your hair can look great anytime & Anywhere with the Easy to-use-MiniSleek
Hi my name is Marlene I'm a professional hairstylist. I'm excited to introduce to you a portable wireless flatiron. I came across this idea when I was working on my hair and thought about how inconvenient it would be to take the flatiron with me and to travel with it.I call it MiniSleek. MiniSleek is a cordless flatiron that is small enough to fit in your purse so that you can use it for touch ups throughout the day when you are on the go.  Unlike other options on the market this one is battery operated, so no bulky cords or bases to worry about. Currently I’m working with a manufacturing and design firm to make this product come to life.  I already have all of the components defined but I’m asking for your support to raise the money required for full product design and the first production run of 1000 units, making this product available for everyone to use.
What We Need & What You GetCurrently We have a patent pending and we need to raise $ 50000 to complete the first production run. The money raised will allow us to finish the first prototype and manufacture the first 1000 units. I'm excited to bring this product to the market because of its truly unique portable features. I designed the Minisleek to be compact for maximum convenience when traveling even overseas; you don't  have to worry about electricity conversion while traveling abroad. The Minisleek is easy to carry in your purse making it simple to touch up your hair while you're on the road. 
While the traditional flatiron can smooth your hair but do not come with all the convenience of the cordless flatiron. Here are some points of why this product is different from the traditional flatiron in the market.    







Light weight 


Straighten and curl



Even heat smooth glide



Battery operated that lasts 30- 40 minutes



You can take it with you to use throughout the day for touch ups



Great for travel don't have to worry about electricity conversion



No hassle with messy wires that get in your way



Comes with heat resistant box cover so you don't have to wait till the flatiron cools.


High quality titanium plates heat up faster making your hair silky, smooth, shiny and
frizz free while your on the go to your next event or destination

<p class=""p1"">Hello! And thank you so much for stopping by!</p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>My name is Nick Evers, and I am on a quest to achieve a major career highlight. I am trying to bring my vision to Brooklyn Fashion Week. </strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">This campaign is to help fund what it will cost for me to achieve this goal. </p>
<p class=""p1"">First, a little bit about myself. Born and raised in Florida, my mother encouraged my budding passion for the arts. She also allowed me to play with toys not typically seen in the hands of boys...namely, Barbie dolls. Little did she know that both of those things would spark a lifelong passion for fashion design.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My epiphany came when, in the late 90s, Bob Mackie came out with a line of dolls that were so beautifully clothed and beaded, that it became clear to me that there was something especially wonderful about the art of designing clothes. It was then that a sketch pad and some pencils were never too far from my grasp. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Flash forward to my especially wild and experimental fashion days in high school, I began to seriously look into fashion schools. A summer program suggestion came from my psychology professor, and I began my experience at Savannah College of Art and Design, where I would eventually attain a Bachelor of Fine Arts in fashion design, specializing in menswear, and a minor in accessory design. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I would go on to have work featured in a window display at Saks Fifth Avenue in Atlanta, GA, 3 fashion shows and lots of freelance work. </p>
<h3 class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjD5FxRhpYI"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>CLICK HERE TO SEE MY FIRST FASHION SHOW OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL!</strong></a></span></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Now I live in the Bronx, NY. One might say I've made it, I'm a designer in New York. But, I won't be satisfied with ""just making it."" I want to push myself. I want to continue to bring myself to the next level. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That is exactly why this campaign is so important to me. This event, which I am so thankful I am able to participate in, will do just that. It will help to bring my vision front and center to the people of New York. </p>
<h2 class=""p4""><strong>My Goals</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1"">As many will attest, getting a fashion collection together is neither easy, nor cheap. While I am very good with stretching dollars, for this, I need a little assistance. </p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>My financial goal for this campaign is $3,500, which will cover most of the following:</strong></h3>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li5"">Designer fee for Brooklyn Fashion Week</li>
<li class=""li5"">Full body male dress form</li>
<li class=""li5"">Machines</li>
<li class=""li5"">Fabrics, trims and materials</li>
<li class=""li5"">Photographer</li>
<li class=""li5"">Videographer</li>
<li class=""li5"">Promotional materials</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">So what's in it for you? Awesome, one-of-a-kind handbags, clothes and other items!</p>
<p class=""p1"">For an idea of what I've made in the past and what you may expect to see as part of your incentive, you can visit my website at:</p>
<h3 class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://nickevers.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.nickevers.com</strong></a></span></h3>
<p class=""p1"">For ""The Ultimate Experience"" and ""VIP Experience"" levels, this is where you can experience what it's like to have a tote/messenger or garment made just for you! Designed just the way you want it, with colors, pockets and trims all up to you. As the designer, I will help guide you to your ideal bag/garment if you're unsure of where to start. </p>
<p class=""p1"">If the full $3,500 isn't reached, the money that is raised will be carefully assessed, and put towards what I can afford. </p>
<h2 class=""p4""><strong>Why This Campaign?</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1"">There may be some who see fashion as frivolous. Something that is not of great importance. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I am not one of those people. </p>
<p class=""p1"">To me, fashion is a living, breathing art that everyone on this planet participates in everyday. It's a message of who we are, what we're doing, where we're going. It's the ultimate form of self expression. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It is my greatest passion. I am a very hard working, creative designer, who would love the opportunity to push the commitment to his craft further.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In supporting this campaign, you are not only supporting the arts and creativity, but you are also helping me to achieve my dreams. And anything you can contribute to that, my gratitude will be never ending.</p>
<h2>What Else Can I Do?</h2>
<p>If you cannot contribute, I can totally understand! If you still want to help me in my journey, share, tweet and post this campaign for all to see. Use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your attention, and I hope to see you from the runway in October!</p>

We love music. We love ukuleles. We love minimalism. We love wood. We love metallic chrome.
Plug in and Play.
 
YOUR SUPPORT. YOUR BENEFIT.
By participating and supporting this campaign, you become a founding parent of a cool, respectable, socially responsible North American ukulele brand.
Your name is recorded as a founding funder and becomes a proud part of our history. (Yet, you can choose to be anonymous.)
Your perk (a limited edition Elekstick ukulele) is a future collectors’ item.
 

OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD A RESPECTABLE UKULELE BRAND.
www.aichibimusic.com
We are serious believers of a quote from Jake Shimabukuro, one of the greatest ukulele players in the world. He once said, “If everyone played the ukulele, the world would have been a much happier place.”
Our goal is to become a reputable ukulele manufacturer. Our company is based in Toronto, Canada. All our AICHIBI ukuleles, including Elekstick ukuleles, are manufactured in Canada.
If you support us through this indiegogo campaign, your name will be recorded and displayed as a founding funder of AICHIBI on our website. You become a proud part of our history. (However, for any reason, if you do not want your name to appear, we will respect that, too.)
If you are supporting with $140 and up, you will receive one of the first batch of Elekstick ukuleles. “Indiegogo Campaign Limited Edition” will be engraved on your Elekstick ukulele. Imagine. Once we become a reputable ukulele brand, your Elekstick ukulele becomes a collectors’ item. This is a good investment.
PROJECTION OF LASER ENGRAVED “INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN LIMITED EDITION” (It will actually look better than this.)

PROJECTION OF THE CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION (It will actually look much better than this.)

 
FEATURES
Minimalistic Tenor Electric Ukulele Design
Solid Hardwood Bodies (Hard Maple, White Oak, Black Walnut or Bubinga)




Genuine Aquila Nylgut Strings
Piezo Pickup System
Volume and Tone Controls
Indian Rosewood Fingerboard and Bridge

Ox Bone Nut and Saddle
Natural Oil Matte Finish
 
WE BELIEVE IN SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF BUSINESSES.
We will be donating our ukuleles to children’s hospitals so that these hospitals can use our ukuleles in their music therapy or as discharge gifts.
You can also participate by supporting us with $180 and more (details in funder’s options). For each Elekstick ukulele you fund through “Good Bird Specials” or “Angel Bird Specials”, we will donate one uke-kid ukulele ($40 retail value; Basswood model).

We also have a plan to support ukulele teachers/tutors, especially ukulele educators teaching at senior residents or public schools. For this matter, please contact us at info@aichibimusic.com.

There is estimated to be over 500 attendees at the show along with the 25+ artists showcasing there. Since most of my friends and family live in CT I understand that attending this event on a Sunday night might be difficult, so instead of nagging everyone to buy tickets to support me, I decided that raising the money here would be easier and I will front all the ticket money myself.

</div></div>","Hey Indiegogo!
My name is Andy Dewar and together with my partner, Antonio Rodrigues, we are the founders of Dewar Watches, a new, Swiss, luxury, handcrafted, watch company.
Mine and Antonio's business relationship formed when back in the summer of 2013, I sold my two year old social networking site with 1,000,000+ members to Antonio. After the sale we both discovered we had a passion for watches and decided to start a watch company. We then took to the drawing board (or laptop) to design some prototypes. After about a week of designing prototypes, we finally got to see the finished product.
So that's enough about us, let's have a look at the watches.

 The Dewar Moon is a beautiful timepiece that was inspired by a friend saying the dial looked like a moon. The name just stuck from then!

 This is the Dewar Helmsman in Red. This timepiece was inspired by my love of yachts, and another name for the captain of a boat is the Helmsman. This piece is available in Red, Blue, Green and Orange.

The Dewar Flight Scale is a perfect timepiece to wear on your private jet. The inspiration was taken from just that, the jet life of billionaires.
So they're the watches, here's the technical info:
Size and weight Case width:41 mm excluding crown
 Thickness: 12 mm
Water resistance: 50 m / 5 ATM (not swim/dive)
Our watches are made by hand in Stockholm, Sweden and normally take around 3 days to produce. They are the best quality. That's our mind state, if it isn't perfect, it isn't right.
What will the Indiegogo funding go to?
Advertising,
Getting a bulk order of Dewar Watches.
We have a deal with a large retailer for 100 Dewar Watches, unfortunately at this time we can't afford to do it ourselves, so we hope Indiegogo will be able to help!
If anyone has any questions feel free to email either myself or Antonio at sales@dewarwatches.com and we'll be able to help you!
Otherwise, Happy Pledging!

After shipping our stain & odour repellent shirts to fresh men in 98 countries it’s time to venture into an equally important part of the male body - the bottom.  Get ready to dress more stylish, without compromising on performance and comfort.Washing your pants less means they will look good for years. Combined with the superior craftsmanship and enforced seems and thread these pants will outlast any other pants in your closet.The outside repels liquids and semi-liquids, while the inside is anti-bacterial and odour repellent.   They repel all water-based liquids such as red wine, coffee or cola.
 Through extensive research and prototyping at our lab in Switzerland, we have created a unique treatment mix called FreshCore™. By manipulating cotton fibers we shield them from both bacteria and liquids. Our treatments do not affect the hand feel of the fabric. Thanks to the yarn construction we are able to reach similar or higher levels of breathability than any untreated pants in the market.        All research and production are done in Europe and are Blue-Sign certified and in line with REACH, which are the world's harshest regulations of use of chemicals in apparel. In short - you do not have to worry about the effect of our tech on neither your body nor the environment.Wear both formal and casual We wanted to create great-looking pants that fit, feel and perform well - no matter what your day brings.The flap cover ensures a clean look while the hidden elastic waistband in the sides give extra stretch and comfort, whether you are running to a meeting or sitting on a plane. It also means you can stick to your size: whether you lose or gain a few your kilos, your pants will still fit perfectly. We have added an extra-strong click button for an easy, but secure closure with an additional button to avoid the fabric pulling on the front.  We wanted to make sure everyone gets their perfect length: Even though our pants come in 2 lengths, we have also added 4 cm hidden extra length, should you need a little extra. Function and looks in one: the discrete pocket zip means you can keep your valuables safe without compromising on the look of your pants. The zip pocket conveniently fits your smartphone or passport. These pants are made for the long run, thanks to the enforced seams and strong polyester thread. All details such as buttons and belt loops also have enforced stitching. Don't take our word for it. We use the unfiltered platform Trustpilot for all reviews - both the good and the bad. We have no way to interfere with the reviews. This is a part of our commitment to full transparency in both production, sustainability and customer experience (we're not gonna tell you our secret recipe though).We have been making stain & odour free cotton for almost 2 years. The reactions from across the world have been unreal.Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear lab coats. And LABFRESH works with the best of them in Switzerland and Portugal. By setting up a dedicated supply chain from scratch and rocking the internet LABFRESH is helping the creators get their smart inventions out of the lab and into closets across the globe.                 When we develop a new product we put our back into it. We obsess. That’s why we only launched 3 products in 3 years.By reducing the need for washing we extend the lifetime of our products. By investing in longevity, durability, and wearability we contribute to lowering consumerism. Wash less. Wear more. Buy less.                 We keep a close eye on our environmental footprint and as a company, we take full responsibility. This includes ensuring the best work environment at our manufacturers in Europe.                 At LABFRESH we work from a technology-based vision and non-seasonal approach into building a collection that embraces longevity and essentials. Nobody needs as many clothes as the fashion industry is producing. Our story began almost 3 years ago on this platform when we launched the odour and stain repellent shirt.                 We got 1,000% funded and immediately quit our jobs, so we could turn LABFRESH into a real business.                 Launching new products is scary. It requires a lot of resources to get new technologies out of the lab and into a real supply chain.                 That is why we would like to see if the Indiegogo community is interested in our new invention before we go into full-scale production.                 Our mission hasn’t changed. We want to fight fast fashion and over-consumption by creating products engineered to last a lifetime.                 Wear more. Wash less. Buy less.    Unlimited cancellation. You are able to cancel your order at any point in time and get a full refund (until the day the product is shipped).90 days size guarantee. If your size is wrong we send you a new product in the right size, free of charge (we do not provide free return labels).Free and easy shipping across the EU, US & Canada. Shipping costs to other parts of the world is only €15.Stain repellency                   We guarantee that our pants will repel stains that are caused by water-based fluids and semi-fluids.

<h1><em>The Future of Your Files</em></h1>
<p>Imagine a world where you no longer have to fight for control of your files.  A future where you are given the option to change your mind after you have sent a file.  A place where your online experience will not be dependent on the trust of others. </p>
<p>Today it only takes one moment of indiscretion to create a lifetime of problems and we at EJS Technologies believe this should not be the case. We built DotGon with the idea that not everything should live forever on the internet and that people should have a choice to protect themselves.</p>
<h1>
<em>Let us introduce you to </em><em>DotGon</em>
</h1>
<p>DotGon allows you to control files long after they have left your computing device.  DotGon takes a unique approach to the problem by allowing the file originator to exert their rights as the owner and place a set of constraints on the file consisting of number of views, view duration, and time window before sending it to an individual. Recipients are bound by these constraints and once the file has been terminated by views or time, it cannot be retrieved. All copies of the file are also invalid so forwarding has no detrimental effect.</p>
<h1><em>Our Story</em></h1>
<p>DotGon’s initial concept came to us after one of our team members took a vacation to a tropical beach and after returning, wanted to share his vacation pictures taken of him.  Being a professional and not wanting the photos of his pasty white sun screened chest to get posted to Facebook, he started fishing around for different ways to share his pictures without giving up control.  What he found was that there was no way to prevent his files from being distributed by anyone who had received them.  Thus the seed of DotGon was planted.</p>
<p>As we started talking with our friends, we realized that such a system was desired for not only pictures, but for documents, video, audio, long term storage, and many other uses.  It seemed that everyone we talked to had a new use for this software system.  The problem with having all of those features from the start is that we would never actually get around to releasing the software, so we had to limit it down to a core set of features, but we have the hooks in place to expand for the future.</p>
<h1><em>The DotGon File</em></h1>
<p>DotGon uses an AES 256 bit encryption algorithm to protect files.  The DotGon file is a self-contained file that can be sent via any regular file transfer protocol (email attachment, instant messenger file transfer, FTP, etc.).  The file itself will be easily identifiable with a .gon file extension.  When you double-click on a DotGon file, it will spawn the DotGon application.</p>
<h1><em>The DotGon Application</em></h1>
<p>The DotGon Application is where all of the heavy lifting is done.  From the DotGon application, you can choose to either build a new DotGon File or attempt to open one that someone sent to you.  In the future we will also have a console that will allow you to change permissions on the file after it has left your computer.  Please keep in mind that the demo in the video is for an early copy of the Alpha, and one of the first working versions.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z480/jestercolorado/DotGon/double_app.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""DotGon""/>            </p>
<h1><em>Building a DotGon File</em></h1>
<p>From inside the application there is a tab to build a DotGon file.  You have an area to select the file you want to protect.  From there you can select the constraints of your file through a series of simple drop down menus.</p>
<p>The production version will have the following protections:<br/>1. The window in time that the file is available to be viewed<br/>2. How many views are available for the file<br/>3. The duration that someone can view the file</p>
<p>The production version will utilize the following file types:<br/>jpg, gif, and txt</p>
<h1><em>What we are here to do</em></h1>
<p>1. Complete the Alpha and move into a Beta status<br/>2. Start the Beta with enough users to weed out any issues<br/>3. Take feedback from our Beta users and assess what the Beta users can’t live without<br/>4. Finalize and launch the first consumer versions of DotGon</p>
<h1><em>Breakdown of Deliverables</em></h1>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z480/jestercolorado/DotGon/T-ShirtReduced.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are several moving parts here for deliverables, so here is the breakdown of when each item is going to be ready to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Swag</strong> – T-Shirts, Hats, and Water Bottles are going to be processed as soon as we have firm numbers as to how many we need to order.  Give some manufacturing time in there to get them done and then factor in boxing and shipping, and we are talking 6-10 weeks for those to be in your hands.</li>
<li>
<strong>PC Beta</strong> – This is the item that we are the closest to at the moment.  We have a list of fixes and enhancements that need to be addressed before it is ready, but we are only talking about 2-3 months after the Indiegogo campaign ends before you will have a working Beta.  Everyone who contributes to this campaign is going to have access to the Beta and the time spent in Beta does not count toward your Production Version license time. </li>
<li>
<strong>PC Production Version</strong> – We are planning an 8-10 week Beta testing phase before we have a good idea of what the final version needs.  Based on those requirements, we will probably take another 2-3 months to finalize those changes before Version 1.x is ready to go out the door.  We are planning on keeping the Beta alive until the Production Version 1.x is live.  There will be a hard cutover at that point, but we will give at least a week’s notice before we shut down the Beta.</li>
<li>
<strong>Android Beta</strong> – This is a little harder to predict and is going to be based on many other factors, including staffing levels and how much help the PC version needs, but we are estimating that the Android Beta will be ready by no later than April 2013.  Hopefully, and with your generous support, we will be able to hire additional development people that can knock this out before the end of the year, but with current staffing levels we have to play conservative on the dates.</li>
<li>
<strong>Android Production Version</strong> – The Android Beta is also going to run through an 8-10 week testing phase before we are able to really commit to a date for the Android Production Version 1.x, but it should be similar to the PC version with a 2-3 month lag.  We will be keeping you posted on these developments as they are decided.</li>
<li>
<strong>Future Features Vote</strong> - The DotGon team has many ideas for new features that we eventually want to roll into the main DotGot system.  People who pledge into being able to vote are going to set the course for the company by voting for what features are the most important to them.  You vote it, we build it.  It is as simple as that.</li>
<li>
<strong>MMA Fights</strong> - While we would all like to see Brittany going head to head in the ring, the real situation is that we have no idea when she is going to fight again or where it may happen.  The best we can offer here is that Brittany comes with us to a fight featuring other fighters.  If Brittany does schedule a fight that is convenient for us, we will take as many people to that fight that we can, but no guarantees.</li>
<li>
<strong>iPhone</strong> - The development of an iPhone version is going to take place after the PC and Android versions are released, scheduled for release sometime in 2013.  The iPhone version of DotGon is one of our stretch goals that you can make happen sooner with your generous support.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Golden Inner Circle</strong> - The people who pledge into the Golden Inner Circle will have access to the DotGon team, to include any new swag that we come up with, first access to what we are working on and when it will be ready, your own full page write-up on the DotGon webpage telling everyone how much we love you and why you are such a cool person, among other exclusive benefits.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shipping &amp; Handling Charges</strong> - Please make certain that you add the correct amount for shipping and handling.  If you have not included shipping and handling, you will be dropped back to the previous tier.</li>
</ul><h1><em>Licenses</em></h1>
<p>The DotGon system will be a yearly subscription service.  This is an effort to keep the prices down as low as we possibly can, to give many more people access to the application.  It always annoys us when we find that required safety components are extremely expensive, so we are going to fight back in our own way.  The timer for production copies will begin one month after the production versions for each product are released, or as soon as you register your copy, whichever is sooner.  Supporters from Indiegogo are getting cheaper prices than what we will be offering people who purchase the product later at retail.</p>
<h1><em>The Future of DotGon</em></h1>
<p>We have many ideas for where to take DotGon in the future.  We think that it is going to be very important to get this application on Mac's and iPhones to get as many of your friends as possible living up to the expectation of secure and limited file sharing.  All of these different systems will be able to use the same exact .gon file as everyone else.</p>
<p>Future builds will take the protect up a couple of notches with the introduction of choosing who can view a file.  We have plans for this that would allow you to select one person in the world that would be able to open a file, and then it wouldn't matter how many copies you send out or post to a community forum, only the one person assigned to receive the file will be able to view it.  The current build is a bit of a horse race where the first person gets the file.  Once we have this file assignment system in place, we will also allow you to assign a single file to multiple recipients, taking some of the repetitiveness out of sharing files.</p>
<p>As further enhancements to assigning files, we are also going to release with it a way to disable files that have already been sent as well as a stats page that will allow you to see if a recipient has viewed your file and for how many times.</p>
<h1><em>Closing</em></h1>
<p>It is not often that you get to be in on the ground floor of a truly disruptive technology.  DotGon has the ability to revolutionize the simple process of exchanging files.  With your help and support, we can turn the vision into a reality.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and generous donations.  Please help us spread the word.  Please like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p>

<h1><em>News Articles</em></h1>
<p>Since starting to actively work on DotGon, we have been collecting articles that do a very good job of delineating the problem that we are solving. While these are not required reading, we hope that you may browse them and get an idea of what dangers lay out there for files that you have no control over.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong><em>Q: What is DotGon?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: DotGon is a file control system that allows you to keep control of your files after they have left your computing device.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Why is the application called DotGon?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: It is called DotGon because of the file extension on the DotGon file, which is simply “.gon”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What platforms is DotGon currently on?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: Currently we are working on a Windows PC version as well as an Android version.  If user response is high, we hope to make it compatible with all major platforms.  The app is designed to run on any Windows operating system that hasn’t been labeled as “extremely archaic” by the computing world (i.e. only Win 7, Vista, and XP).</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What files types are currently useable through DotGon?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: .jpg, .gif, .txt (although there are some serious limitations on text files currently).</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: I want to send my video/.doc file/Cad file/etc./etc. through DotGon.  What can I do?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: Please be patient with us as we push the development team to build in all of the different file types and platforms that are feasible.  Apparently by law we have to give them bathroom breaks and let them go home at night.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: I was sent a .gon file.  Now what do I do?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: You are going to need a copy of the application in order to view the file.  Once you open the file in the application, the rest is actually pretty easy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: How much does DotGon cost?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: We are not currently selling DotGon except for our campaign on Indiegogo.  When our campaign is successful, we hope to have DotGon ready for regular consumption within a few months after completing our beta testing.  Those wonderful individuals who support our Indiegogo campaign are going to be the first with consumer copies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: I heard that DotGon is a yearly subscription.  What’s up with that?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: DotGon is a server heavy application that we want to keep the price down on.  Your yearly subscription is keeping the servers on while at the same time funding heavy development activities designed to deliver you new document types, more platforms, and more user functionality, delivering them to you for no additional cost as soon as they are ready.  All of these things are ongoing expenses that your yearly subscription pays for.   </p>
<p><strong><em>Q: I was sent a DotGon file and wasn’t able to open it/need to open it again/need to get the original file out/etc./etc.</em></strong></p>
<p>A: The easiest way to get around this problem is to have the file originator send a new copy to you, since we don’t keep copies of files and value your privacy just as much as we value our own. Please don’t send us any DotGon files, we will not open any files for you or do you a favor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: When is the DotGon application going to do _________?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: We would love to hear your ideas about what you would like to see incorporated into DotGon.  Please email us and we will take a look at whatever suggestions you have.  We aren’t making any promises, but a good idea is a good idea.  Keep in mind that any idea that you send us will be owned by us and we will not be able to give anyone credit for what you send to us.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: My internet went down and now I can’t open my DotGon file.  What can I do?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, DotGon requires an active internet connection in order to get the latest information about the file.  Have you tried a coffee shop?</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: How are the files stored?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: Your files are stored in an encrypted format with a “.gon” extension.  You can then send your file via email, texting, flash drive, and IM.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: How do I know it is safe?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: This is a tough question to answer.  The short answer is since we are using modern encryption methods, it is going to be very hard for someone to open your file.  The unfortunate part about encryption is that nothing is ever 100% safe.  We have worked DotGon files to the point that we feel that we are 99.999999% safe, but breaking encryption algorithms is only a matter of time and effort.  Given enough time and enough computing power, anything can be broken.  So is it breakable?  Short answer is yes.  But hopefully we have made it so difficult to do that it is not worth the time and effort to do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: So what is keeping me from taking a screenshot of it?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: This is also a tough question.  The quick answer here is that screenshots, copy &amp; paste, and screen capture applications will all be disabled in the viewer.  The viewer was built such that if you touch a key on the keyboard or click the mouse, the view window will collapse, ending the view.  What we cannot stop is further malicious captures of the screen with a second device.  Our prediction is that for normal use, the best most people will be able to do is to take picture of a view with a cell phone.  The activity of doing this may have copyright repercussions.  To make an analogy, the goal here is to lock the house, but you cannot prevent a professional thief from gaining access some other way, but will keep out most violators.  We have ideas in the pipeline to help alleviate this problem; we will let you know when they are ready to go.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Is DotGon legal?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: In the United States it is legal.  Outside of the United States, it greatly depends on the laws governing you.  Needless to say, if it is not legal for you to use DotGon, don’t use it.</p>

Imagine a world where you no longer have to fight for control of your files.  A future where you are given the option to change your mind after you have sent a file.  A place where your online experience will not be dependent on the trust of others. 
Today it only takes one moment of indiscretion to create a lifetime of problems and we at EJS Technologies believe this should not be the case. We built DotGon with the idea that not everything should live forever on the internet and that people should have a choice to protect themselves.

Let us introduce you to DotGon

DotGon allows you to control files long after they have left your computing device.  DotGon takes a unique approach to the problem by allowing the file originator to exert their rights as the owner and place a set of constraints on the file consisting of number of views, view duration, and time window before sending it to an individual. Recipients are bound by these constraints and once the file has been terminated by views or time, it cannot be retrieved. All copies of the file are also invalid so forwarding has no detrimental effect.
Our Story
DotGon’s initial concept came to us after one of our team members took a vacation to a tropical beach and after returning, wanted to share his vacation pictures taken of him.  Being a professional and not wanting the photos of his pasty white sun screened chest to get posted to Facebook, he started fishing around for different ways to share his pictures without giving up control.  What he found was that there was no way to prevent his files from being distributed by anyone who had received them.  Thus the seed of DotGon was planted.
As we started talking with our friends, we realized that such a system was desired for not only pictures, but for documents, video, audio, long term storage, and many other uses.  It seemed that everyone we talked to had a new use for this software system.  The problem with having all of those features from the start is that we would never actually get around to releasing the software, so we had to limit it down to a core set of features, but we have the hooks in place to expand for the future.
The DotGon File
DotGon uses an AES 256 bit encryption algorithm to protect files.  The DotGon file is a self-contained file that can be sent via any regular file transfer protocol (email attachment, instant messenger file transfer, FTP, etc.).  The file itself will be easily identifiable with a .gon file extension.  When you double-click on a DotGon file, it will spawn the DotGon application.
The DotGon Application
The DotGon Application is where all of the heavy lifting is done.  From the DotGon application, you can choose to either build a new DotGon File or attempt to open one that someone sent to you.  In the future we will also have a console that will allow you to change permissions on the file after it has left your computer.  Please keep in mind that the demo in the video is for an early copy of the Alpha, and one of the first working versions.
            
Building a DotGon File
From inside the application there is a tab to build a DotGon file.  You have an area to select the file you want to protect.  From there you can select the constraints of your file through a series of simple drop down menus.
The production version will have the following protections:1. The window in time that the file is available to be viewed2. How many views are available for the file3. The duration that someone can view the file
The production version will utilize the following file types:jpg, gif, and txt
What we are here to do
1. Complete the Alpha and move into a Beta status2. Start the Beta with enough users to weed out any issues3. Take feedback from our Beta users and assess what the Beta users can’t live without4. Finalize and launch the first consumer versions of DotGon
Breakdown of Deliverables
 
There are several moving parts here for deliverables, so here is the breakdown of when each item is going to be ready to go.


Swag – T-Shirts, Hats, and Water Bottles are going to be processed as soon as we have firm numbers as to how many we need to order.  Give some manufacturing time in there to get them done and then factor in boxing and shipping, and we are talking 6-10 weeks for those to be in your hands.

PC Beta – This is the item that we are the closest to at the moment.  We have a list of fixes and enhancements that need to be addressed before it is ready, but we are only talking about 2-3 months after the Indiegogo campaign ends before you will have a working Beta.  Everyone who contributes to this campaign is going to have access to the Beta and the time spent in Beta does not count toward your Production Version license time. 

PC Production Version – We are planning an 8-10 week Beta testing phase before we have a good idea of what the final version needs.  Based on those requirements, we will probably take another 2-3 months to finalize those changes before Version 1.x is ready to go out the door.  We are planning on keeping the Beta alive until the Production Version 1.x is live.  There will be a hard cutover at that point, but we will give at least a week’s notice before we shut down the Beta.

Android Beta – This is a little harder to predict and is going to be based on many other factors, including staffing levels and how much help the PC version needs, but we are estimating that the Android Beta will be ready by no later than April 2013.  Hopefully, and with your generous support, we will be able to hire additional development people that can knock this out before the end of the year, but with current staffing levels we have to play conservative on the dates.

Android Production Version – The Android Beta is also going to run through an 8-10 week testing phase before we are able to really commit to a date for the Android Production Version 1.x, but it should be similar to the PC version with a 2-3 month lag.  We will be keeping you posted on these developments as they are decided.

Future Features Vote - The DotGon team has many ideas for new features that we eventually want to roll into the main DotGot system.  People who pledge into being able to vote are going to set the course for the company by voting for what features are the most important to them.  You vote it, we build it.  It is as simple as that.

MMA Fights - While we would all like to see Brittany going head to head in the ring, the real situation is that we have no idea when she is going to fight again or where it may happen.  The best we can offer here is that Brittany comes with us to a fight featuring other fighters.  If Brittany does schedule a fight that is convenient for us, we will take as many people to that fight that we can, but no guarantees.

iPhone - The development of an iPhone version is going to take place after the PC and Android versions are released, scheduled for release sometime in 2013.  The iPhone version of DotGon is one of our stretch goals that you can make happen sooner with your generous support.

The Golden Inner Circle - The people who pledge into the Golden Inner Circle will have access to the DotGon team, to include any new swag that we come up with, first access to what we are working on and when it will be ready, your own full page write-up on the DotGon webpage telling everyone how much we love you and why you are such a cool person, among other exclusive benefits.

Shipping & Handling Charges - Please make certain that you add the correct amount for shipping and handling.  If you have not included shipping and handling, you will be dropped back to the previous tier.
Licenses
The DotGon system will be a yearly subscription service.  This is an effort to keep the prices down as low as we possibly can, to give many more people access to the application.  It always annoys us when we find that required safety components are extremely expensive, so we are going to fight back in our own way.  The timer for production copies will begin one month after the production versions for each product are released, or as soon as you register your copy, whichever is sooner.  Supporters from Indiegogo are getting cheaper prices than what we will be offering people who purchase the product later at retail.
The Future of DotGon
We have many ideas for where to take DotGon in the future.  We think that it is going to be very important to get this application on Mac's and iPhones to get as many of your friends as possible living up to the expectation of secure and limited file sharing.  All of these different systems will be able to use the same exact .gon file as everyone else.
Future builds will take the protect up a couple of notches with the introduction of choosing who can view a file.  We have plans for this that would allow you to select one person in the world that would be able to open a file, and then it wouldn't matter how many copies you send out or post to a community forum, only the one person assigned to receive the file will be able to view it.  The current build is a bit of a horse race where the first person gets the file.  Once we have this file assignment system in place, we will also allow you to assign a single file to multiple recipients, taking some of the repetitiveness out of sharing files.
As further enhancements to assigning files, we are also going to release with it a way to disable files that have already been sent as well as a stats page that will allow you to see if a recipient has viewed your file and for how many times.
Closing
It is not often that you get to be in on the ground floor of a truly disruptive technology.  DotGon has the ability to revolutionize the simple process of exchanging files.  With your help and support, we can turn the vision into a reality.

FAQ
Q: What is DotGon?
A: DotGon is a file control system that allows you to keep control of your files after they have left your computing device.
Q: Why is the application called DotGon?
A: It is called DotGon because of the file extension on the DotGon file, which is simply “.gon”.
Q: What platforms is DotGon currently on?
A: Currently we are working on a Windows PC version as well as an Android version.  If user response is high, we hope to make it compatible with all major platforms.  The app is designed to run on any Windows operating system that hasn’t been labeled as “extremely archaic” by the computing world (i.e. only Win 7, Vista, and XP).
Q: What files types are currently useable through DotGon?
A: .jpg, .gif, .txt (although there are some serious limitations on text files currently).
Q: I want to send my video/.doc file/Cad file/etc./etc. through DotGon.  What can I do?
A: Please be patient with us as we push the development team to build in all of the different file types and platforms that are feasible.  Apparently by law we have to give them bathroom breaks and let them go home at night.
Q: I was sent a .gon file.  Now what do I do?
A: You are going to need a copy of the application in order to view the file.  Once you open the file in the application, the rest is actually pretty easy.
Q: How much does DotGon cost?
A: We are not currently selling DotGon except for our campaign on Indiegogo.  When our campaign is successful, we hope to have DotGon ready for regular consumption within a few months after completing our beta testing.  Those wonderful individuals who support our Indiegogo campaign are going to be the first with consumer copies.
Q: I heard that DotGon is a yearly subscription.  What’s up with that?
A: DotGon is a server heavy application that we want to keep the price down on.  Your yearly subscription is keeping the servers on while at the same time funding heavy development activities designed to deliver you new document types, more platforms, and more user functionality, delivering them to you for no additional cost as soon as they are ready.  All of these things are ongoing expenses that your yearly subscription pays for.   
Q: I was sent a DotGon file and wasn’t able to open it/need to open it again/need to get the original file out/etc./etc.
A: The easiest way to get around this problem is to have the file originator send a new copy to you, since we don’t keep copies of files and value your privacy just as much as we value our own. Please don’t send us any DotGon files, we will not open any files for you or do you a favor.
Q: When is the DotGon application going to do _________?
A: We would love to hear your ideas about what you would like to see incorporated into DotGon.  Please email us and we will take a look at whatever suggestions you have.  We aren’t making any promises, but a good idea is a good idea.  Keep in mind that any idea that you send us will be owned by us and we will not be able to give anyone credit for what you send to us.
Q: My internet went down and now I can’t open my DotGon file.  What can I do?
A: Unfortunately, DotGon requires an active internet connection in order to get the latest information about the file.  Have you tried a coffee shop?
Q: How are the files stored?
A: Your files are stored in an encrypted format with a “.gon” extension.  You can then send your file via email, texting, flash drive, and IM.
Q: How do I know it is safe?
A: This is a tough question to answer.  The short answer is since we are using modern encryption methods, it is going to be very hard for someone to open your file.  The unfortunate part about encryption is that nothing is ever 100% safe.  We have worked DotGon files to the point that we feel that we are 99.999999% safe, but breaking encryption algorithms is only a matter of time and effort.  Given enough time and enough computing power, anything can be broken.  So is it breakable?  Short answer is yes.  But hopefully we have made it so difficult to do that it is not worth the time and effort to do so.
Q: So what is keeping me from taking a screenshot of it?
A: This is also a tough question.  The quick answer here is that screenshots, copy & paste, and screen capture applications will all be disabled in the viewer.  The viewer was built such that if you touch a key on the keyboard or click the mouse, the view window will collapse, ending the view.  What we cannot stop is further malicious captures of the screen with a second device.  Our prediction is that for normal use, the best most people will be able to do is to take picture of a view with a cell phone.  The activity of doing this may have copyright repercussions.  To make an analogy, the goal here is to lock the house, but you cannot prevent a professional thief from gaining access some other way, but will keep out most violators.  We have ideas in the pipeline to help alleviate this problem; we will let you know when they are ready to go.
Q: Is DotGon legal?
A: In the United States it is legal.  Outside of the United States, it greatly depends on the laws governing you.  Needless to say, if it is not legal for you to use DotGon, don’t use it.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><b>How Brazilian Sexy
Came To Be</b></h2>
<p>The Brazilian Sexy idea was born on the day Sandy exclaimed ""Now
you're Brazilian Sexy!"" to one of her Brazilian wax clients
after their Brazilian wax. 
</p>
<p>Immediately
Sandy liked the catchy phrase that tumbled out of her mouth and
thought of how the Brazilian Sexy idea could help women feel sexy and
confident just as Brazilian waxes do. As the Brazilian Sexy idea grew
in her mind, she envisioned <i>i am brazilian sexy</i> embroidered
across the front of spa aprons that could be worn by Brazilian wax
specialists and and t-shirts sporting the Brazilian Sexy logo they
could sell to their wax clients.  Soon she called Desiree and
said, “Hey, I have this great idea for an new brand of logo wear,
would you like to partner with me?”</p>
<p>And so our
partnership began and we went to work designing the brand's logo,
testing its printing and embroidery on various fabrics and developing
relationships with our vendors to create finished pieces of our
Brazilian Sexy logo wear.  Almost nightly, after coming home
from our day jobs, we worked on the registration of our Brazilian
Sexy trademark and an e-commerce site to sell our logo wear.
 <a href=""http://www.iambraziliansexy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.iambraziliansexy.com
</a>will sell directly to spas, salons and independents that offer
Brazilian waxing to their clients.</p>
<p>As we spent the last two years forming our tiny company, we
realized our interest in boosting women's self esteem with our fun
and sassy logo wear wasn't enough. We have always wanted the ability
to support more women's causes but our financial resources are
limited with just the two of us.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Sexy: Philanthropy Over Profits</h3>
<p>As a woman-owned business we decided the focus of our company
would be one of philanthropy over profits, by donating 10% of our
profits to women's causes. Not only will women feel good wearing
Brazilian Sexy logo wear but they will feel good knowing some of the
money from their purchases will automatically go to some of the best
causes supporting women and girls on the planet. <b>Imagine: In one
action, each customer's money would do far more in combination with
other Brazilian Sexy customers than they could do alone!</b></p>
<p>The initial list of causes we will support will be listed on our
e-commerce site when it goes live on May 1, 2014.  As our
company grows, so too will the list of women's charities we will
support. This philanthropic focus will be the integral part of our
business model as long as Brazilian Sexy is in business.</p>
<p>With some of our profits going to organizations that help deliver
women and girls from oppression we hope to play a small part in
uplifting them so that they are not merely surviving but thriving.</p>
<p><b>Our Mission: </b>The Brazilian Sexy brand will perpetually support the
causes that help women feel better and live happier lives while at
the same time helping our customers feel bold and confident in our
logo wear. It's a win-win for everyone!

Snow boots are a pain to put on.  Trekking boots are a bit of an overkill. Anything else will probably not keep your feet warm and dry as you go through puddles, grass, sleet, rain or snow.  That was the idea that lead us to creating VOYLOK felt boots. And as we started exploring it further, we discovered so much more.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617370046/bo0yvgkgogbkwgzwl8lr.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>A better and more sustainable way to dress for the weather</i></p><p>VOYLOK boots build on centuries-old tradition of making felted wool garments, and bring it to the modern-day city and countryside. Felting is a remarkably sustainable way to make things – it only uses wool and hot water. No chemicals, no dyes, glue or bleach. So any by-products – basically, muddy water – can go straight to your garden.</p><p><strong>Why would I want to wear VOYLOK boots?</strong></p><p>""What?"" we hear you say. Spring is here, and summer is around the corner. Why would I care about warmth now? VOYLOK boots deliver warmth and comfort across all seasons and weather. Besides, next winter is coming. We all know this much!</p><p>Originally, wool felt boots were made to keep your feet warm all day in knee-deep snow and Siberian frosts. VOYLOKs are a lighter, slimmer, more refinedversion of those heavy-duty boots, and they perform equally well all year round. How is this possible? Wool felt is highly breathable, and is great at both trapping heat and absorbing moisture. Whether it is cold or warm outside, your feet are just as comfortable inside VOYLOK boots. And the overshoes keep the puddles away.</p><p>Yes, the overshoes! You can take them off, and continue wearing your VOYLOKs indoors. Never mind cold floors again! This is perfect for home or home office. Or any office, really – certainly the air-conditioned ones. VOYLOKs just might replace your favourite slippers. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618173887/tsoqg5lwvqb9hjjbyjtw.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>With VOYLOK, you get two pairs of shoes in one!</i></p><p><strong>How are they made?</strong></p><p>It takes great skill to make felt boots, and luckily this incredible craftsmanship has survived to this day. The boots are made entirely by hand. Mastering the craft takes up to a year, and it takes a whole week to craft your pair of VOYLOK boots from a bale of raw wool in a process unlike anything else. First, the raw wool is combed. Then the booty is grown layer by layer. Bathed in hot water. Shrunk. Sculpted from the inside. Then dried in a wood-fired oven. In a week's time, they are ready.  Grown, not sewn, for inner warmth.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617370459/zm8su1ahmfcygrq7rgtm.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Sculpted, not sewn</i></p><p>This is so old school that it has become new school again. If we were race car engineers, could say that VOYLOK boots are a monocoque, unibody construction made from a natural composite in one continuous layer with no seams. Or you could say they are 3-D printed by hand. The hands make all the difference.</p><p><strong>Why we need your help</strong></p><p>We have partnered with small factories – craft shops, really – to develop the VOYLOK range. Their methods remain authentic as they pass their skills down the generations. The design work is done, and we are very happy with the prototypes. To make the VOYLOK boots a reality, we need to invest in new sets of shoe lasts and moulds for every size in the range, and that requires significant upfront capital. By supporting our campaign, you will help us make that capital investment, and thus make VOYLOK range a reality. We will bring more year-round consistency to the factory’s workload, and facilitate full time employment outside of winter months.</p><p>And you will get your pair of VOYLOKs in time for the next cold season, just as you will want them the most! We will deliver your pledge by October 2021. <i>Help us to help you get ready for the next winter... and to bring good warmth back into this world!</i></p><p><strong>When would I want to wear VOYLOK boots?</strong></p><p>VOYLOK boots are built for the winter, of course, no matter whether your winters are frosty and snowy, or wet and miserable, or simply cool. But that’s just the beginning. You will enjoy them any season for walks in the park, or taking your dog out in the evening. A quick nip to the garden when you can’t be bothered to use a shoehorn or tie your laces. A bike ride to the shops. The school run. Pamper your feet after your ballet class. Warm them up after a wild swim or a surf session. Go fishing. Stay comfortable in the office. Drive in them if you must – you won’t destroy your heels after a muddy walk.</p><p>You can dress your VOYLOK boots up or down as much as you please. From country bog to city smog, they will deliver the warmth and comfort.</p><p>Or wear them when you simply want to kick your feet up and do absolutely nothing. This is hygge-to-go.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617370601/hxxtv6mlsvoxsyzqzjvy.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Hygge-to-go</i></p><p> </p><p><strong> REWARDS. What kind of VOYLOK boots can I pledge for? </strong></p><p>This crowdfunding campaign is for the premium Raw Core range of VOYLOK boots: the original collection, the VOYLOK 1.0. ‘Raw’ stands for natural, un-dyed wool, which has not been compromised by acids or chemicals, just bathed in hot water. Sheep normally come in some grade of white, or some shade of grey. So these are the two colours we offer: Some Kind Off-White and A Shade of Grey.  Wool comes in small batches, and every sheep is unique, so there will be some variation from one batch to another. We think this is great.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617370706/pfwd6xqou1stuefsng0t.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>The VOYLOK Raw Core range: the Logs, Fogs and Clogs all mixed up.</i></p><p>There are four styles of the boots of different length: the low-cut CLOGs, the shorty FOGs, the mid-length LOGs (they are roughly the length of a fireplace log!), and the tall BOGs.  Clogs, Fogs, Logs and Bogs, in ascending order. We think the Logs are the go-to model as they are the most versatile. But the Clogs are a surprisingly practical number, too, and are many people’s favourite. Choose the short-cut Fogs if you like that style better, and the gorgeous Bogs for that knee-high look.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617371425/gvmfphfu5smzjg8nic6d.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The overshoes will be available in red or black.

<li>Rain boots, unless you go more than ankle-deep in mud or water. For most other occasions in the city or countryside, VOYLOKs will do a better job: lighter, breathable, always warm and comfy.</li>
<li>Sheepskin boots. Because the wool felt in VOYLOK is raw and less treated, so it is kinder to the environment as well as your skin. The overshoe protects VOYLOKS from moisture, so they are more versatile and last longer, too. And fleecing doesn’t kill sheep.</li>
<li>Snow shoes/duck shoes. Because VOYLOKs are easy to put on and off, they are much lighter and just as versatile. The lining or inner booty in snow boots is almost never made of natural felt (but rather synthetics), so it is not as warm, does not last as long, does not massage and caress your feet.</li>
<li>Garden clogs. Because VOYLOK clogs are warmer, and you can keep wearing them indoors.</li>
<li>Designer sneakers, casual shoes. Because do you really need over-engineered, over-supportive fast fashion footwear that will look ridiculously obsolete in a year?</li>

VOYLOK boots feel light (because they are!), and comfortably roomy. Nothing presses or rubs. In fact, within a week or two they will mould to the shape of your foot. They are soft, but not too soft – the felt texture gives you a gentle massage. It is much like walking barefoot – the sole is soft, there is no heel or extra arch support – yet your feet are protected and insulated. In fact, we think it is best to wear VOYLOK boots completely barefoot, skin on felt, the wool lanolin nourishing your skin. You could also pair them with socks, but you’d be missing out on part of the joy.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618155009/uzkxqmkbzx5ji1be58zn.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>159g (5.6oz) for a VOYLOK Log size 36. Flip-flops can weigh more than this! Complete pair with overshoes weighing in at 605g (21oz) - less than half the weight of winter boots, but equally warm and more versatile. Half the wight of your rain boots, too!</i></p><p>VOYLOKs will be comfortably loose on your foot. Easy to slip on and off, yet comfortable to walk in. Very useful for driving in wet weather – you will not destroy the heels in these. Initially, they will shed a little bit of wool – this is normal. If you are very lucky, you might find a small bit of straw embedded in the felt– that’s for good luck. You can pluck it out or leave it in, your luck won’t change. That’s because we don’t use any harsh chemicals which would normally destroy vegetable matter in the wool when making yarn.</p><p><strong>Choosing Size, Style and Colour</strong></p><p><i>What size should I get?</i></p><p>At the end of the campaign we will send a survey to find out which size, styles and colours you want to order. We are offering size range equivalent to  36-46 (UK 3.5 - 11.5, US 5.5 women's - 12 men's) in whole size increments. We will ask for your foot measurement, too, and will tell you how to do it. VOYLOKs are meant to feel a little loose, and they will mould to the shape of your foot within a week or two.</p><p>You will want to add about a centimetre (1/3 inch – ½ inch) to the length of your feet for the proper VOYLOK feel, more if you intend to wear them with thick socks. So if you are size 35 (UK 3, US Womens 5),  you can still order our smallest size. Remember, the VOYLOK boots will really mould to the contours of your feet with wear – shrink some, stretch some. Size up!</p><p>If you are looking for size larger than 47 and above (UK 12, US 13) – please let us know. If we get enough requests for these large sizes, we might be able to run a batch!</p><p>In our video, Galina wears the VOYLOK Logs size 39 with red overshoes, Nina wears the tall VOYLOK Fogs size 36, and Lida wears a kids version of VOYLOK boots which we are not offering yet (watch this space – follow our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/voylok_lab/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram here</a>).

That's how most sheep are. There is small natural variation of colour between different batches of wool, and as VOYLOK are unbleached and not dyed, this variation carries through to the finished product. Overshoes are either Scarlet (red) or Noir (black).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618155136/ldddifmzlfib1slnbuie.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>VOYLOK Raw Core colour palette.

What is this? Shoes that give your toes plenty of space rather than bunch them together, and that give your whole foot wiggle room. VOYLOKS feel wonderful to wear, they are never tight, and easy to slip on and off. Minimalist footwear does not seek to do your feet’s work for them, and feature low-profile soles, no heels no arch support. What, no arch support you say? Isn’t that bad? We’ve been trained to think so, but that’s actually not true. When you walk barefoot, your feet’s muscles and tendons are supporting the arch, and that keeps your feet toned and strong. It’s because we allow our feet to grow weak – by wearing over-supportive shoes, and by walking too little – that we grow to rely on footwear to do that job for us.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618155304/gpetbpp9k2fj0phhvpic.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Barefoot feel, yet your feet are warm and protected.</i></p><p>Start by taking short walks in your VOYLOKS, and enjoy the freedom of walking barefoot while staying warm. Do try actual barefoot walking – in the park, on the beach – then slip back into VOYLOKs effortlessly. It doesn’t matter how cold it is outside!</p><p>If that feels hard, you can insert your usual supportive insole for the transition period, or better still – start doing some foot exercises. There are plenty available on the internet, and we will be posting some good ones on our Instagram.</p><p>Your VOYLOKs come with a removable felt insole which you may or may not want to use depending on how much cush you require.</p><p><i>VOYLOKs can be your step towards a natural, barefoot lifestyle.</i></p><p><strong>How sustainable are they? Are they green? Vegan-friendly?</strong></p><p>Wool is a natural fibre grown by sheep that roam freely in the countryside. Sheep re-grow their fleece every year, making wool one of the most sustainable fibres available. Farming also helps to preserve the landscapes, as sheep grazing maintains the countryside, creating habitats for wildlife to thrive.</p><p>As long as there is grass for sheep to eat, wool can be produced, in contrast to synthetic fibres, which require oil and refineries, a non-renewable resource for man-made fibre production.</p><p>The only by-products of felting are muddy water and felt off-cuts, and they both can go in the garden.  We are collecting most scraps and off-cuts for use in accessories and other helpful items. The boots are dried in a wood-fired oven (large sauna, really) fuelled by wood waste from local forestries.</p><p>The VOYLOK felt is made with no use of acids, bleaches or dyes – just raw wool, hot water and very skilled craftsmanship. This is beyond what any industrial process can offer. So far beyond. We rely on skill, rather than tech and waste.</p><p>When you are done with your VOYLOKs – they will serve for years, but nothing is forever – they can go straight back to nature. Cut them up for crafts, or use the felt as a pot liner for your plants – it is great at trapping moisture. Or just dig them in your flower bed – they will be great at preventing drought. Plant a tree in one!</p><p>What happens to the sheep? Sheep are not killed when they are shorn. In fact, it is a good idea to shear sheep late in spring as it helps them during summer, and it prevents deadly fly strike (when flies lay eggs in the fleece, and the larvae then dig into the skin). We are aware of reported instances of cruelty to sheep at large industrial-scale farms and we oppose harsh treatment of animals. The sheep that supply their wool for VOYLOK are raised by local smallholders in small flocks. The sheep are treated well and live long lives at pasture. Is this vegan? You decide. We are happy to bring a product like this into our world.</p><p>What about the overshoe? The mainstream industry options are rubber or silicone. Both have their pros and cons. We prefer silicone for its performance in cold weather, low carbon footprint and recyclability.  Silicone is UV-resistant and hypoallergenic – you can probably find silicone items in your kitchen!</p><p>We are also exploring new exciting material developments – such as compounds made out of sea algae, or natural rubber made out of dandelion sap (yes, really!). If you have a view on this, do chime in!</p><p>We are trying hard to be gentle and kind both to our feet and the environment.</p><p><strong>Our Environmental Commitments</strong></p><p><i>Long-lasting design</i></p><p>Skilled craftsmanship results in very high quality construction. With due care, the VOYLOK boots will last years and years, longer than typical mass-produced footwear. We subscribe to the slow fashion ethos, and our designs work in collections rather than seasons, and there is no planned obsolescence in our design process.</p><p><i>Reusability and recyclability</i></p><p>With VOYLOK boots you really get two boots in one - a pair for outdoor adventures and, with the overshoes off - a warm and comfortable indoor pair. The versatility of VOYLOKs allows them to fulfil the role of several types of shoes - rain boots, snow boots, walking/trekking boots, garden clogs, casual shoes and slippers. This is very suitable to a minimalist lifestyle. Wool felt is completely biodegradable and can go directly into your garden as a form of compost.</p><p><i>Sustainable materials</i></p><p>The VOYLOK felt boots are made with no use of acids, bleaches or dyes – just raw wool, hot water and very skilled craftsmanship. This is beyond what any industrial process can offer. Wool is 100% renewable and biodegradable, you could plant a tree in your old VOYLOK boot to help it grow. The silicone overshoe is recyclable, and we are looking into cutting edge alternatives, too - such as materials made from sea algae or dandelion sap (really).</p><p><i>Environmentally friendly factories</i></p><p>Our factories are small, more like workshops than industrial giants. They have been around for decades if not centuries, and no new carbon need to be embedded in the premises or equipment. The drying of the felt boots is done in wood-fired ovens fuelled by offcuts and scraps from local forestry.</p><p><strong>Are the boots made in some sweatshop?</strong></p><p>No. The people in the video are the actual people who will be making your VOYLOKs. They are highly skilled, enjoy their work and provide for the families. They are not merely colleagues, but more like a multi-generational extended family. Most of them live within walking distance of the workshop. By launching VOYLOK, we will help create steady employment outside of the peak winter months.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618155447/f1enbvfnly538th0xbgy.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>It takes great skill and craftsmanship to create your pair of VOYLOKs. Zhanna Leonidovna, Irina Vladimirovna, Tatyana Pavlovna, Olesya Vladimirovna and Galina Vladimirovna make sure of that.</i></p><p>The Raw Core range will be made in the authentic workshop in the North of Russia. For further collections, we will be looking to include additional workshops and small factories in Russia, Belarus and Finland. For the production of the overshoe, we are looking to make a final selection between specialised factories in Europe or Asia.</p><p><strong>Care</strong></p><p>It is very easy to care for your VOYLOK boots, but it is important that you do it right. If you get them muddy (lucky you, keep at it!), just wait for the mud to dry, and then brush it off with a clothes brush, or a clean shoe brush. If you get them wet – or, rather, when you get them wet – don’t be afraid, VOYLOK will be fine in the puddles and in the rain, unlike sheepskin boots which are destroyed by moisture. Let them dry overnight at room temperature, that’s it. Do NOT put them on a hot radiator, or on top of your AGA stove (we know it is tempting) as they might shrink. Setting them beside a radiator or Aga stove should be fine, but you normally would not need this. Just remove the overshoe, remove the felt insole if you managed to get that wet, too, and let them dry overnight. That’s all it takes.</p><p>If you are very particular about cleanliness and insist on keeping your VOYLOKS spotless (no judgement), you can use mild soap and brush to remove any hard stains, and then rinse the soap off with brush and water. Even the white VOYLOKS will clean very well that way.</p><p>So: clothes brush, and sometimes – soap and water. That’s all it takes. Don’t be afraid to take your VOYLOKs anywhere – cold, damp, puddles, snow, slush, sea, rain – it’s all good.</p><p>As with all woollens, you will need to protect your VOYLOKs from moth if you put them away for a long time.</p><p><strong>What is wool felt?</strong></p><p>To quote <a href=""https://www.britishwool.org.uk/wool-felt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">British Wool</a>, felt is a soft fabric made from natural fibres, such as wool. Wool felt is created when wool fibres are compressed and matted together using heat, moisture and pressure, creating a dense, strong fabric made up of permanently interlocking fibres.</p><p>Wool has many natural features and benefits, so felt made from wool offers benefits across many different products, as well as being 100% renewable and biodegradable. Wool makes naturally great felt and felted fabric thanks to the complex structure of wool fibre. The outside layer of wool fibre – the cuticle – consists of overlapping scales. When rubbed together or dampened, the scales interlock with each other, creating a durable felt material.</p><p><strong>Do you use some kind of special wool for VOYLOK boots?</strong></p><p>We don’t have to. Felting works well with many kinds of wool, and there is no need to seek out exotic varieties for VOYLOK boots. The local sheep breed that will supply the wool for the Raw Core range happens to be called the Romanov Sheep – but there is nothing elitist about them, really!</p><p><strong>Tell me again the benefits of VOYLOK wool felt footwear?</strong></p><p>Gladly! Here they are:</p><ul>
<li>Very warm on a cold day (ANY cold day), yet comfortable on a warm summer day.</li>
<li>Very light. Lighter even than most summer shoes.</li>
<li>Hygroscopic. Feet stay dry. Never sweaty. Never clammy.</li>
<li>Highly breathable. Even with the overshoe on.</li>
<li>No bacteria or fungi on wool fibres, so healthy feet and no stink</li>
<li>Lanolin in the wool fibres nourishes your skin</li>
<li>Felt pampers your feet, but does not spoil them with softness: they get a very gentle massage</li>
<li>Easy to slip on and take off. No pulling, nor even the need to bend.</li>
<li>Boots mould to your feet. No blisters</li>
<li>Very kind to your feet, and to the environment.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What is lanolin?</strong></p><p>Lanolin oil is a secretion from sheep’s skin. The purpose of lanolin is to condition and protect sheep’s wool. This conditioning property is why the substance is now widely used in human cosmetics, skin care, and hair products. Lanolin is extremely hydrating and has the ability to soften skin to help improve the appearance and the feel of rough, dry, or flaky areas. Since no chemicals, dyes, acids or bleaches are used when making VOYLOK wool felt boots, the lanolin in the wool is retained for the benefit of your skin.</p><p><strong>How are these different to <i>Valenki</i>?</strong></p><p>We are keeping VOYLOK boots as close to the design principle and manufacturing ethos of valenki – the original Russian winter footwear. The VOYLOK boots are completely, 100% authentic. We are, however, making them for modern city and countryside where you don’t need to survive for days at freezing temperatures of -30, but rather feel warm and comfortable on a dog walk or commute to the office. So we make them thinner and lighter while retaining their strength, and also shape them better for your feet so you don’t need to wear a thick sock. In fact, you can be barefoot in them, and that’s most enjoyable. You can still wear VOYLOKs at an alpine ski resort and you will be totally warm!</p><p><strong>Fulfilment</strong></p><p>We will optimise fulfillment to achieve the most direct route of shipment to our backers in the UK and Russia, and intend to ship directly from Russia to all other countries.  Backers will be responsible for import duties, where applicable, for international pledges.</p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>As with any new venture, there are risks of things taking longer than projected, unexpected costs and overruns. We have substantial experience in bringing new products to market, and this will help us to manage the risks of launching VOYLOK. BREXIT has created uncertainty about import duties and fees. Customers outside the United Kingdom and Russia might be required to pay import duties and fees upon receipt of their pledge.</p><p><strong>Further plans</strong></p><p>We have many ideas in the pipeline for VOYLOK. Our first priority after launching the Raw Core range for adults is finalizing the kids &amp; toddlers range. We are exploring collaborations with minimalist shoe brands as well as cutting edge designers. We are also working on a line of accessories made from wool felt, mostly scraps and off-cuts from the VOYLOK production.

Wool and hot water - that's all it takes to craft a pair of VOYLOKs!Rain boots are heavy and not breathable. Snow boots are a pain to put on.  Trekking boots are a bit of an overkill. Anything else will probably not keep your feet warm and dry as you go through puddles, grass, sleet, rain or snow.  That was the idea that lead us to creating VOYLOK felt boots. And as we started exploring it further, we discovered so much more.A better and more sustainable way to dress for the weatherVOYLOK boots build on centuries-old tradition of making felted wool garments, and bring it to the modern-day city and countryside. Felting is a remarkably sustainable way to make things – it only uses wool and hot water. No chemicals, no dyes, glue or bleach. So any by-products – basically, muddy water – can go straight to your garden.Why would I want to wear VOYLOK boots?""What?"" we hear you say. Spring is here, and summer is around the corner. Why would I care about warmth now? VOYLOK boots deliver warmth and comfort across all seasons and weather. Besides, next winter is coming. We all know this much!Originally, wool felt boots were made to keep your feet warm all day in knee-deep snow and Siberian frosts. VOYLOKs are a lighter, slimmer, more refinedversion of those heavy-duty boots, and they perform equally well all year round. How is this possible? Wool felt is highly breathable, and is great at both trapping heat and absorbing moisture. Whether it is cold or warm outside, your feet are just as comfortable inside VOYLOK boots. And the overshoes keep the puddles away.Yes, the overshoes! You can take them off, and continue wearing your VOYLOKs indoors. Never mind cold floors again! This is perfect for home or home office. Or any office, really – certainly the air-conditioned ones. VOYLOKs just might replace your favourite slippers. With VOYLOK, you get two pairs of shoes in one!How are they made?It takes great skill to make felt boots, and luckily this incredible craftsmanship has survived to this day. The boots are made entirely by hand. Mastering the craft takes up to a year, and it takes a whole week to craft your pair of VOYLOK boots from a bale of raw wool in a process unlike anything else. First, the raw wool is combed. Then the booty is grown layer by layer. Bathed in hot water. Shrunk. Sculpted from the inside. Then dried in a wood-fired oven. In a week's time, they are ready.  Grown, not sewn, for inner warmth.Sculpted, not sewnThis is so old school that it has become new school again. If we were race car engineers, could say that VOYLOK boots are a monocoque, unibody construction made from a natural composite in one continuous layer with no seams. Or you could say they are 3-D printed by hand. The hands make all the difference.Why we need your helpWe have partnered with small factories – craft shops, really – to develop the VOYLOK range. Their methods remain authentic as they pass their skills down the generations. The design work is done, and we are very happy with the prototypes. To make the VOYLOK boots a reality, we need to invest in new sets of shoe lasts and moulds for every size in the range, and that requires significant upfront capital. By supporting our campaign, you will help us make that capital investment, and thus make VOYLOK range a reality. We will bring more year-round consistency to the factory’s workload, and facilitate full time employment outside of winter months.And you will get your pair of VOYLOKs in time for the next cold season, just as you will want them the most! We will deliver your pledge by October 2021. Help us to help you get ready for the next winter... and to bring good warmth back into this world!When would I want to wear VOYLOK boots?VOYLOK boots are built for the winter, of course, no matter whether your winters are frosty and snowy, or wet and miserable, or simply cool. But that’s just the beginning. You will enjoy them any season for walks in the park, or taking your dog out in the evening. A quick nip to the garden when you can’t be bothered to use a shoehorn or tie your laces. A bike ride to the shops. The school run. Pamper your feet after your ballet class. Warm them up after a wild swim or a surf session. Go fishing. Stay comfortable in the office. Drive in them if you must – you won’t destroy your heels after a muddy walk.You can dress your VOYLOK boots up or down as much as you please. From country bog to city smog, they will deliver the warmth and comfort.Or wear them when you simply want to kick your feet up and do absolutely nothing. This is hygge-to-go.Hygge-to-go  REWARDS. What kind of VOYLOK boots can I pledge for? This crowdfunding campaign is for the premium Raw Core range of VOYLOK boots: the original collection, the VOYLOK 1.0. ‘Raw’ stands for natural, un-dyed wool, which has not been compromised by acids or chemicals, just bathed in hot water. Sheep normally come in some grade of white, or some shade of grey. So these are the two colours we offer: Some Kind Off-White and A Shade of Grey.  Wool comes in small batches, and every sheep is unique, so there will be some variation from one batch to another. We think this is great.The VOYLOK Raw Core range: the Logs, Fogs and Clogs all mixed up.There are four styles of the boots of different length: the low-cut CLOGs, the shorty FOGs, the mid-length LOGs (they are roughly the length of a fireplace log!), and the tall BOGs.  Clogs, Fogs, Logs and Bogs, in ascending order. We think the Logs are the go-to model as they are the most versatile. But the Clogs are a surprisingly practical number, too, and are many people’s favourite. Choose the short-cut Fogs if you like that style better, and the gorgeous Bogs for that knee-high look.The overshoes will be available in red or black. We will offer more colour options down the road, and you could have more than one pair of overshoes of different colour to properly accessorize your VOYLOKs. But to begin with, it is Red or Black. Scarlet and Noir, if you prefer.How to Wear Them. The VOYLOK LookVOYLOK Clogs​VOYLOK Clogs in grey and white.

Rain boots, unless you go more than ankle-deep in mud or water. For most other occasions in the city or countryside, VOYLOKs will do a better job: lighter, breathable, always warm and comfy.
Sheepskin boots. Because the wool felt in VOYLOK is raw and less treated, so it is kinder to the environment as well as your skin. The overshoe protects VOYLOKS from moisture, so they are more versatile and last longer, too. And fleecing doesn’t kill sheep.
Snow shoes/duck shoes. Because VOYLOKs are easy to put on and off, they are much lighter and just as versatile. The lining or inner booty in snow boots is almost never made of natural felt (but rather synthetics), so it is not as warm, does not last as long, does not massage and caress your feet.
Garden clogs. Because VOYLOK clogs are warmer, and you can keep wearing them indoors.
Designer sneakers, casual shoes. Because do you really need over-engineered, over-supportive fast fashion footwear that will look ridiculously obsolete in a year?
Remember, with VOYLOK you don't just get all-season comfort. You get and outdoor and an indoor shoe in one.Outdoors and indoors. VOYLOK boots are two shoes in one.Here is how we think VOYLOKs compare at a glanceIf you do not see a need for VOYLOK boots in your life but would like to support our cause, we will thank you for your gift pledge with a digital card featuring original VOYLOK art. Do not pledge for a pair of VOYLOKs just because you like them. You know you shouldn’t. Or should you?Timeline The VOYLOK Team Andrey Petrov, founder of VOYLOK , has over 20 years experience building successful businesses and developing new brands for major multinational companies.

VOYLOK boots feel light (because they are!), and comfortably roomy. Nothing presses or rubs. In fact, within a week or two they will mould to the shape of your foot. They are soft, but not too soft – the felt texture gives you a gentle massage. It is much like walking barefoot – the sole is soft, there is no heel or extra arch support – yet your feet are protected and insulated. In fact, we think it is best to wear VOYLOK boots completely barefoot, skin on felt, the wool lanolin nourishing your skin. You could also pair them with socks, but you’d be missing out on part of the joy.159g (5.6oz) for a VOYLOK Log size 36. Flip-flops can weigh more than this! Complete pair with overshoes weighing in at 605g (21oz) - less than half the weight of winter boots, but equally warm and more versatile. Half the wight of your rain boots, too!VOYLOKs will be comfortably loose on your foot. Easy to slip on and off, yet comfortable to walk in. Very useful for driving in wet weather – you will not destroy the heels in these. Initially, they will shed a little bit of wool – this is normal. If you are very lucky, you might find a small bit of straw embedded in the felt– that’s for good luck. You can pluck it out or leave it in, your luck won’t change. That’s because we don’t use any harsh chemicals which would normally destroy vegetable matter in the wool when making yarn.Choosing Size, Style and ColourWhat size should I get?At the end of the campaign we will send a survey to find out which size, styles and colours you want to order. We are offering size range equivalent to  36-46 (UK 3.5 - 11.5, US 5.5 women's - 12 men's) in whole size increments. We will ask for your foot measurement, too, and will tell you how to do it. VOYLOKs are meant to feel a little loose, and they will mould to the shape of your foot within a week or two.You will want to add about a centimetre (1/3 inch – ½ inch) to the length of your feet for the proper VOYLOK feel, more if you intend to wear them with thick socks. So if you are size 35 (UK 3, US Womens 5),  you can still order our smallest size. Remember, the VOYLOK boots will really mould to the contours of your feet with wear – shrink some, stretch some. Size up!If you are looking for size larger than 47 and above (UK 12, US 13) – please let us know. If we get enough requests for these large sizes, we might be able to run a batch!In our video, Galina wears the VOYLOK Logs size 39 with red overshoes, Nina wears the tall VOYLOK Fogs size 36, and Lida wears a kids version of VOYLOK boots which we are not offering yet (watch this space – follow our Instagram here). Andrey wears VOYLOK Log Long boots size 44 (UK 10)ColourVOYLOK boots are any colour as long as it is A Shade of Grey (grey) or Some Kind Off-White (white). That's how most sheep are. There is small natural variation of colour between different batches of wool, and as VOYLOK are unbleached and not dyed, this variation carries through to the finished product. Overshoes are either Scarlet (red) or Noir (black).VOYLOK Raw Core colour palette. The boot is either Some Kind Off-White (white) or A Shade of Grey (Grey). The overshoes are either Scarlet (red) or Noir (black).StyleHere is a recap of the four styles of VOYLOK boots that we offer as part of the Raw Core range:
VOYLOK CLOGs: for your home, office, or home office. For your garden, too!
VOYLOK FOGs: low-cut boot, very light.
VOYLOK LOGs: (Regular and Long): mid-length boot, the go-to model.
VOYLOK BOGs: gorgeous high boot, available as stretch goal only. 
Is “barefoot” good or bad for you?We are big fans of minimalist, “barefoot” footwear. What is this? Shoes that give your toes plenty of space rather than bunch them together, and that give your whole foot wiggle room. VOYLOKS feel wonderful to wear, they are never tight, and easy to slip on and off. Minimalist footwear does not seek to do your feet’s work for them, and feature low-profile soles, no heels no arch support. What, no arch support you say? Isn’t that bad? We’ve been trained to think so, but that’s actually not true. When you walk barefoot, your feet’s muscles and tendons are supporting the arch, and that keeps your feet toned and strong. It’s because we allow our feet to grow weak – by wearing over-supportive shoes, and by walking too little – that we grow to rely on footwear to do that job for us.Barefoot feel, yet your feet are warm and protected.Start by taking short walks in your VOYLOKS, and enjoy the freedom of walking barefoot while staying warm. Do try actual barefoot walking – in the park, on the beach – then slip back into VOYLOKs effortlessly. It doesn’t matter how cold it is outside!If that feels hard, you can insert your usual supportive insole for the transition period, or better still – start doing some foot exercises. There are plenty available on the internet, and we will be posting some good ones on our Instagram.Your VOYLOKs come with a removable felt insole which you may or may not want to use depending on how much cush you require.VOYLOKs can be your step towards a natural, barefoot lifestyle.How sustainable are they? Are they green? Vegan-friendly?Wool is a natural fibre grown by sheep that roam freely in the countryside. Sheep re-grow their fleece every year, making wool one of the most sustainable fibres available. Farming also helps to preserve the landscapes, as sheep grazing maintains the countryside, creating habitats for wildlife to thrive.As long as there is grass for sheep to eat, wool can be produced, in contrast to synthetic fibres, which require oil and refineries, a non-renewable resource for man-made fibre production.The only by-products of felting are muddy water and felt off-cuts, and they both can go in the garden.  We are collecting most scraps and off-cuts for use in accessories and other helpful items. The boots are dried in a wood-fired oven (large sauna, really) fuelled by wood waste from local forestries.The VOYLOK felt is made with no use of acids, bleaches or dyes – just raw wool, hot water and very skilled craftsmanship. This is beyond what any industrial process can offer. So far beyond. We rely on skill, rather than tech and waste.When you are done with your VOYLOKs – they will serve for years, but nothing is forever – they can go straight back to nature. Cut them up for crafts, or use the felt as a pot liner for your plants – it is great at trapping moisture. Or just dig them in your flower bed – they will be great at preventing drought. Plant a tree in one!What happens to the sheep? Sheep are not killed when they are shorn. In fact, it is a good idea to shear sheep late in spring as it helps them during summer, and it prevents deadly fly strike (when flies lay eggs in the fleece, and the larvae then dig into the skin). We are aware of reported instances of cruelty to sheep at large industrial-scale farms and we oppose harsh treatment of animals. The sheep that supply their wool for VOYLOK are raised by local smallholders in small flocks. The sheep are treated well and live long lives at pasture. Is this vegan? You decide. We are happy to bring a product like this into our world.What about the overshoe? The mainstream industry options are rubber or silicone. Both have their pros and cons. We prefer silicone for its performance in cold weather, low carbon footprint and recyclability.  Silicone is UV-resistant and hypoallergenic – you can probably find silicone items in your kitchen!We are also exploring new exciting material developments – such as compounds made out of sea algae, or natural rubber made out of dandelion sap (yes, really!). If you have a view on this, do chime in!We are trying hard to be gentle and kind both to our feet and the environment.Our Environmental CommitmentsLong-lasting designSkilled craftsmanship results in very high quality construction. With due care, the VOYLOK boots will last years and years, longer than typical mass-produced footwear. We subscribe to the slow fashion ethos, and our designs work in collections rather than seasons, and there is no planned obsolescence in our design process.Reusability and recyclabilityWith VOYLOK boots you really get two boots in one - a pair for outdoor adventures and, with the overshoes off - a warm and comfortable indoor pair. The versatility of VOYLOKs allows them to fulfil the role of several types of shoes - rain boots, snow boots, walking/trekking boots, garden clogs, casual shoes and slippers. This is very suitable to a minimalist lifestyle. Wool felt is completely biodegradable and can go directly into your garden as a form of compost.Sustainable materialsThe VOYLOK felt boots are made with no use of acids, bleaches or dyes – just raw wool, hot water and very skilled craftsmanship. This is beyond what any industrial process can offer. Wool is 100% renewable and biodegradable, you could plant a tree in your old VOYLOK boot to help it grow. The silicone overshoe is recyclable, and we are looking into cutting edge alternatives, too - such as materials made from sea algae or dandelion sap (really).Environmentally friendly factoriesOur factories are small, more like workshops than industrial giants. They have been around for decades if not centuries, and no new carbon need to be embedded in the premises or equipment. The drying of the felt boots is done in wood-fired ovens fuelled by offcuts and scraps from local forestry.Are the boots made in some sweatshop?No. The people in the video are the actual people who will be making your VOYLOKs. They are highly skilled, enjoy their work and provide for the families. They are not merely colleagues, but more like a multi-generational extended family. Most of them live within walking distance of the workshop. By launching VOYLOK, we will help create steady employment outside of the peak winter months.It takes great skill and craftsmanship to create your pair of VOYLOKs. Zhanna Leonidovna, Irina Vladimirovna, Tatyana Pavlovna, Olesya Vladimirovna and Galina Vladimirovna make sure of that.The Raw Core range will be made in the authentic workshop in the North of Russia. For further collections, we will be looking to include additional workshops and small factories in Russia, Belarus and Finland. For the production of the overshoe, we are looking to make a final selection between specialised factories in Europe or Asia.CareIt is very easy to care for your VOYLOK boots, but it is important that you do it right. If you get them muddy (lucky you, keep at it!), just wait for the mud to dry, and then brush it off with a clothes brush, or a clean shoe brush. If you get them wet – or, rather, when you get them wet – don’t be afraid, VOYLOK will be fine in the puddles and in the rain, unlike sheepskin boots which are destroyed by moisture. Let them dry overnight at room temperature, that’s it. Do NOT put them on a hot radiator, or on top of your AGA stove (we know it is tempting) as they might shrink. Setting them beside a radiator or Aga stove should be fine, but you normally would not need this. Just remove the overshoe, remove the felt insole if you managed to get that wet, too, and let them dry overnight. That’s all it takes.If you are very particular about cleanliness and insist on keeping your VOYLOKS spotless (no judgement), you can use mild soap and brush to remove any hard stains, and then rinse the soap off with brush and water. Even the white VOYLOKS will clean very well that way.So: clothes brush, and sometimes – soap and water. That’s all it takes. Don’t be afraid to take your VOYLOKs anywhere – cold, damp, puddles, snow, slush, sea, rain – it’s all good.As with all woollens, you will need to protect your VOYLOKs from moth if you put them away for a long time.What is wool felt?To quote British Wool, felt is a soft fabric made from natural fibres, such as wool. Wool felt is created when wool fibres are compressed and matted together using heat, moisture and pressure, creating a dense, strong fabric made up of permanently interlocking fibres.Wool has many natural features and benefits, so felt made from wool offers benefits across many different products, as well as being 100% renewable and biodegradable. Wool makes naturally great felt and felted fabric thanks to the complex structure of wool fibre. The outside layer of wool fibre – the cuticle – consists of overlapping scales. When rubbed together or dampened, the scales interlock with each other, creating a durable felt material.Do you use some kind of special wool for VOYLOK boots?We don’t have to. Felting works well with many kinds of wool, and there is no need to seek out exotic varieties for VOYLOK boots. The local sheep breed that will supply the wool for the Raw Core range happens to be called the Romanov Sheep – but there is nothing elitist about them, really!Tell me again the benefits of VOYLOK wool felt footwear?Gladly! Here they are:
Very warm on a cold day (ANY cold day), yet comfortable on a warm summer day.
Very light. Lighter even than most summer shoes.
Hygroscopic. Feet stay dry. Never sweaty. Never clammy.
Highly breathable. Even with the overshoe on.
No bacteria or fungi on wool fibres, so healthy feet and no stink
Lanolin in the wool fibres nourishes your skin
Felt pampers your feet, but does not spoil them with softness: they get a very gentle massage
Easy to slip on and take off. No pulling, nor even the need to bend.
Boots mould to your feet. No blisters
Very kind to your feet, and to the environment.
What is lanolin?Lanolin oil is a secretion from sheep’s skin. The purpose of lanolin is to condition and protect sheep’s wool. This conditioning property is why the substance is now widely used in human cosmetics, skin care, and hair products. Lanolin is extremely hydrating and has the ability to soften skin to help improve the appearance and the feel of rough, dry, or flaky areas. Since no chemicals, dyes, acids or bleaches are used when making VOYLOK wool felt boots, the lanolin in the wool is retained for the benefit of your skin.How are these different to Valenki?We are keeping VOYLOK boots as close to the design principle and manufacturing ethos of valenki – the original Russian winter footwear. The VOYLOK boots are completely, 100% authentic. We are, however, making them for modern city and countryside where you don’t need to survive for days at freezing temperatures of -30, but rather feel warm and comfortable on a dog walk or commute to the office. So we make them thinner and lighter while retaining their strength, and also shape them better for your feet so you don’t need to wear a thick sock. In fact, you can be barefoot in them, and that’s most enjoyable. You can still wear VOYLOKs at an alpine ski resort and you will be totally warm!FulfilmentWe will optimise fulfillment to achieve the most direct route of shipment to our backers in the UK and Russia, and intend to ship directly from Russia to all other countries.  Backers will be responsible for import duties, where applicable, for international pledges.Risks and challengesAs with any new venture, there are risks of things taking longer than projected, unexpected costs and overruns. We have substantial experience in bringing new products to market, and this will help us to manage the risks of launching VOYLOK. BREXIT has created uncertainty about import duties and fees. Customers outside the United Kingdom and Russia might be required to pay import duties and fees upon receipt of their pledge.Further plansWe have many ideas in the pipeline for VOYLOK. Our first priority after launching the Raw Core range for adults is finalizing the kids & toddlers range. We are exploring collaborations with minimalist shoe brands as well as cutting edge designers. We are also working on a line of accessories made from wool felt, mostly scraps and off-cuts from the VOYLOK production.

<p>OmniFob™ (patent pending) is a tiny shortcut remote that triggers the apps you use to control your smart devices, scenes, routines, and even your cars. It's like having multiple <a href=""https://www.the-ambient.com/reviews/best-smart-home-buttons-homekit-automation-449"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">smart buttons</a> in one tiny remote. Currently OmniFob can control over 100 devices and scenes. But since OmniFob only has two buttons, how fast is it to access all your devices if you have to scroll through the menu each time? The answer is… <em>Quick Controls</em> :)   </p>
<p>With Quick Controls, you don’t have to look at your OmniFob to activate it. You can simply perform a double-click, long press, quad-click, or shake &amp; click to trigger your most frequently functions. Quick Controls combined with a scene or routine allows you to trigger smart actions quickly without digging your phone out of your pocket or purse, unlocking it, selecting an app, opening it, and then selecting the function you wish to initiate. Quick Controls are completely customizable in the Keyport app so you can assign your most frequently used actions to the Quick Control option of your choice. Currently we are building five standard Quick Controls in addition to a panic trigger for personal security (more on that below).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of Quick Controls you can program yourself in the app.</p>

<p>Without question, auto lock/unlock is the most requested function, and we have heard you loud and clear! Over the past several years, we have researched, examined, outlined, prototyped, and tested dozens of options, and we are excited to introduce you to our first partners in the auto space.</p>
<p>While still early in the development, we are working with two of what we hope will be several aftermarket connected car applications to bring you remote start and lock/unlock solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn your old car or new car into a connected car with functions like remote start, lock/unlock, etc. that can be controlled by both OmniFob and your phone</li>
<li>Control multiple vehicles with a single fob (so long as an OmniFob compatible* aftermarket system is installed in each vehicle)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is true that these first solutions require the purchase and installation of a <strong>compatible*</strong> <strong>smart**</strong> aftermarket system, but the benefits are significant.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> By compatible, we mean an aftermarket system that we have permission to connect to and that we have worked together with the system's developer to integrate.</p>
<p><strong>**</strong> By smart, we mean one that can be controlled by an app on your phone. </p>

<p>Our first partner in this space is an exciting early stage company which is doing very cool things in the car sharing space.  They have been testing their original system all over the World this past year and have recently launched the newest version of their smart auto start / keyless entry system called <a href=""https://mobokey.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MoboKey</a>.</p>
<p>Once the system is installed in your vehicle, OmniFob will be able to control the various MoboKey functions depending upon which version you have.</p>
<p>MoboKey comes in three versions:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>MoboKey Basic</strong> - Basic keyless entry LOCK/UNLOCK @ $70 + shipping. DIY installation.</li>
<li> <strong>MoboKey Plus</strong> - Advanced keyless entry LOCK/UNLOCK @ $90 + shipping. DIY installation.</li>

<p>We are also working with Blue Eclipse, a startup founded by a pioneer in the connected car space who helped develop the first commercially available connected car app at Delphi Automotive. BluRemote by Blue Eclipse (due out in early 2020) offers connected control of OEM and aftermarket remote functions for any car, garage door, or home security alarm without the need for professional installation. DIY installation is simple and requires only a few minutes to configure. For a car, you simply place your remote in a small box, place the box securely in the vehicle (can be hidden or locked down), and you will have access to all of the fob's functions through both OmniFob and the BluRemote app.</p>
<p>Here is a little video sample of this exciting device.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is Only the Beginning...</strong></p>
<p>These are just the first two of what we hope will be several compatible aftermarket systems. If you have one of them already - like Viper SmartStart, Compustar DroneMobile, Completely Keyless, Voyo, etc. - contact them through their website and on social to let them know that you want it to work with OmniFob. The more they hear from you, the greater chance we have of moving up their priority list.</p>
<p>From there, we hope that integration with OEMs will not be far behind.</p>

<p>Having a device separate from the phone that doesn't attract as much attention is a valuable thing when it comes to personal security. In the case of an assault for example, the assailant's first order of business will be to get your phone away from you so that you cannot contact anyone. Having access to a panic button that is separate and that can trigger an event on your phone like texting or calling emergency services, a friend, or family, or even all of them can be critical at such a time. </p>
<p>Several single function panic buttons are already popular on college campuses, for exercising by yourself, for late night walks, and for jobs that can take you to out-of-the way locations and in contact with strangers like a real estate agent.  OmniFob combines it with a range of other functionality so that you don't have to carry multiple devices.</p>

<p>OmniFob pairs to both the Keyport app and the Chipolo app (for locator specific functionality) on your smartphone. Once set up, the commands you issue by selecting the function and then clicking the button on your OmniFob will be sent via Bluetooth to the requisite app which will then initiate your request. For example, to open your garage door, you select the Garage Door - Open/Close function with the Mode button on the side and then click the Select button which initiates the command. The Keyport app receives the command via Bluetooth, determines which function to call, and then initiates the action via API through the cloud.</p>

<p>A tiny keychain flashlight is always a useful everyday carry item.  To give you one that doesn't take up any additional space, we added a mini-flashlight for shining a little light when you need it most.</p>
<p><strong>MULTIPLE CARRY OPTIONS</strong></p>
<p>While IoT is gaining ground, the vast majority of us still carry some form of a keychain. Keys are not going away anytime soon, and our key rings are chock-full of other everyday carry items as well - pocket tools (e.g. mini-flashlight, bottle opener, pocketknife), auto and access fobs, security tokens, contactless payment options, loyalty cards, etc. At Keyport, our mission is to add some organization to the chaos and to transform your keychain from an unwieldy collection of physical items into a fully customizable, modern day, connected multi-tool for the modern lifestyle.</p>
<div data-caption=""OmniFob has multiple carry options besides clipping it to your pocket or bag, "" data-id=""25675071""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""OmniFob has multiple carry options besides clipping it to your pocket or bag, "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1565803974/ijy4m0vj7xzipr55enl8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<figcaption>OmniFob has multiple carry options besides clipping it to your pocket or bag,</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>A part of the Keyport modular everyday carry system, OmniFob is compatible with the Keyport's Anywhere Pocket Clip™ (comes standard and can connect to virtually any keychain), the Keyport Pivot™, and the Keyport Slide™.</p>
<div data-id=""25588377""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1565803975/oj8wsx6gfhqjadwncppb.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p>Before we go into specifics, here are a few general things about OmniFob's security:</p>
<ul>
<li>No biometrics</li>
<li>No direct device connections</li>
<li>No private data stored on the device</li>
<li>No history stored on the device</li>
<li>No unencrypted transfer of data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OmniFob does not connect directly to your devices.</strong> It simply connects to the Keyport app on your smartphone via Bluetooth and acts as a shortcut to your smart apps. It’s that simple. All the work is done app to app, by your smartphone, just as if you are controlling your devices directly from your smartphone. When you press a button to activate a device, scene, or routine on the OmniFob, it sends a signal via Bluetooth to the Keyport App on your phone. Our app sends the command to the 3rd party app, which then triggers the action and... voila. </p>
<div data-id=""25837662""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1565803976/jgpurvx2u0fc6v4fcgao.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p><strong>In the Keyport App, you connect to a compatible 3rd party app via Oauth2 validation.</strong> Once your account is linked, the devices, scenes, and routine names you have programmed in the 3rd party app automatically populate in the Keyport app. The only information written to your OmniFob is the custom names you select for each device, scene, and routine.</p>
<p><strong>What if I lose it?</strong> There is no need to worry about security if you ever lose your OmniFob. It is designed to be a shortcut to your smart phone via Bluetooth. Therefore, OmniFob will not work if it is out of Bluetooth range of your phone and the Keyport app to which it is paired. So, a potential thief would literally have to get a hold of it and be within your smart phone’s Bluetooth bubble (approximately 60 feet) for it to re-pair with your phone.</p>
<p><strong>But we have a simple solution for that too. Just unpair it in the Keyport app and all your devices will be inoperable even if the thief finds his way back into your Bluetooth bubble.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In comes Chipolo</strong> - And lost doesn't mean forever with OmniFob... You will still be able to track it down via our locator powered by Chipolo and its crowd mesh network which shows its last known location. You can check it right on Chipolo's app.</p>
<p>But, let’s say you totally lost it and un-paired it from the Keyport app as described above. Guess what? It is still connected to Chipolo so you can mark your OmniFob as lost in the Chipolo app and you will have a chance at finding it again using their <a href=""https://chipolo.net/en/blogs/12-features-of-the-chipolo-bluetooth-finder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community Search feature</a>. When you get it back you can easily re-pair it with the Keyport app.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymity</strong> - Imagine, you leave your keys somewhere and someone finds them. That person now has access to your car, house, office, and any other keys you have on there. But, unless you have your address on your keys, they are anonymous, right? Most likely, that person is just going to be a good samaritan and turn them into the lost and found. The slim chance that person would become a potential thief is eliminated with OmniFob, because when you un-pair it from the app as described above, it becomes useless.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Before Launch</strong> - In addition to the initiatives we have undertaken during design, we are already putting OmniFobs in the hands of our partners, beta testers, and white hat hackers (some of our security professional friends from DEFCON) to identify any potential issues. We will continue to study best practices and develop a community which helps us to discover and then patch any potential vulnerabilities as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

Using your phone as a hub, the OmniFob app calls secure cloud APIs to control your smart devices through a wide range of communication protocols including Zigbee, Z-Wave, RF, Wi-Fi, Insteon, Bluetooth, etc.Security Note: If you lose your OmniFob, your connected devices will not work outside your phone’s Bluetooth range but you can still track it with the Chipolo app. For security, you can unpair your lost OmniFob’s devices so they won’t work if it re-enters your Bluetooth range, but the Chipolo location service will still work. Once found, you can easily reconnect your devices. More security details under Security below.Current Status - Updated Feb 7th, 2020Hardware / Pilot Run Pre-Production Phase - Currently in the 4th and final iteration of the PCBA, all hardware has been confirmed and tested thoroughly. 50 new pre-production pilot run PCBA units are scheduled to be ready on Feb 25th. 50 pilot run housings are already in house.Firmware / Version 11 - Added Quick Controls, one touch off for Chipolo alarm, deep sleep mode, display error messaging.Software / Version 35 - Yonomi production is now live, MoboKey bugs fixed.Pilot run parts, ready for assemblyAbout KeyportEstablished in 2005, Keyport® is dedicated to creating the next generation multi-tool for the modern lifestyle. We consolidate smart tech (smart home, connected car, Bluetooth locator) and essential physical items (keys, remote fobs, pocket tools) in a modular system that allows Keyporters to build their own personalized everyday carry solutions. Keyport has enthusiastic customers in over 60 countries, and this is Keyport's fourth Kickstarter & second Indiegogo InDemand campaign.
OmniFob has been in development for over two years 
From day one our primary goal at Keyport has been to transform the bulky, jingly, unwieldy, and often unattractive keychain into a stylish multi-tool for the modern lifestyle that streamlines keys, remotes, pocket tools, and smart tech. OmniFob is the final piece in our modular everyday carry system that bridges the gap between a pocket full of unwieldy personal items and a completely connected world. Now, whether it is physical or digital, you can carry less, do more, and add a little sophistication to your everyday carry at the same time.OmniFob is a finger-sized key fob that transforms any standard keychain into a connected life remote providing quick and easy access to your favorite smart functions
without having to lug around multiple cumbersome remotes,
without having to pull out your oversized smartphone, and
without having to use both hands when you're on the go or have your hands full.
Open your garage, unlock your door, turn on your lights, start your car, find your keys, call for help, and more all in one VERY smart fob that attaches easily to any conventional keychain and that is also compatible with Keyport's modular Slide 3.0, Pivot, and Anywhere Tools.Think of it as a mobile hot button for your smartphone... a single key fob that:
controls your favorite smart home functions (garage door, home security, smart locks, smart lights, smart plugs, and more) 
replaces your auto remotes, 
serves as your secret panic button, and 
has a built-in Bluetooth locator so that you never lose it.
OmniFob™ is the World's first all-in-one smart remote for home and auto with BLE locator powered by Chipolo. Just click a button and control your everything.Turn on the lights, open the garage, disarm the alarm, unlock the front door, and even do it all at once!A remote fob's primary value is that it provides quick and easy access to certain functions - ON/OFF, OPEN/CLOSE, LOCK/UNLOCK, ARM/DISARM - you use every day. So, we have focused our efforts on those particular smart home IoT devices which meet that criteria, and they fall into five categories:
Garage Doors
Home Security
Smart Locks
Smart Lights
Smart Outlets & Smart Plugs
However, OmniFob is not limited to these devices. You can control the primary functions of nearly any smart home device. 
Activate multiple devices with one clickRoutines (as Yonomi* calls them) or scenes (as Samsung SmartThings* refers to them) allow a user to initiate multiple commands at once.  For example, a Leave Home routine might include the following:
Close the garage
Lock the front door
Arm the security system
Turn off all smart lights
Set the thermostat to an away temp
Once a routine is programmed in the Yonomi app or in the SmartThings app, OmniFob can initiate it with one simple click.  The possibilities are virtually endless... Wake Up, Go To Sleep, Leave Home, Coming Home are just a few of the most common routines which you can personalize to suit your needs.* see COMPATIBILITY section below to learn exactly what devices OmniFob can control out of the gate. 
OmniFob™ (patent pending) is a tiny shortcut remote that triggers the apps you use to control your smart devices, scenes, routines, and even your cars. It's like having multiple smart buttons in one tiny remote. Currently OmniFob can control over 100 devices and scenes. But since OmniFob only has two buttons, how fast is it to access all your devices if you have to scroll through the menu each time? The answer is… Quick Controls :)   
With Quick Controls, you don’t have to look at your OmniFob to activate it. You can simply perform a double-click, long press, quad-click, or shake & click to trigger your most frequently functions. Quick Controls combined with a scene or routine allows you to trigger smart actions quickly without digging your phone out of your pocket or purse, unlocking it, selecting an app, opening it, and then selecting the function you wish to initiate. Quick Controls are completely customizable in the Keyport app so you can assign your most frequently used actions to the Quick Control option of your choice. Currently we are building five standard Quick Controls in addition to a panic trigger for personal security (more on that below).
Here are a few examples of Quick Controls you can program yourself in the app.



Without question, auto lock/unlock is the most requested function, and we have heard you loud and clear! Over the past several years, we have researched, examined, outlined, prototyped, and tested dozens of options, and we are excited to introduce you to our first partners in the auto space.
While still early in the development, we are working with two of what we hope will be several aftermarket connected car applications to bring you remote start and lock/unlock solutions.

Turn your old car or new car into a connected car with functions like remote start, lock/unlock, etc. that can be controlled by both OmniFob and your phone
Control multiple vehicles with a single fob (so long as an OmniFob compatible* aftermarket system is installed in each vehicle)

It is true that these first solutions require the purchase and installation of a compatible* smart** aftermarket system, but the benefits are significant.
* By compatible, we mean an aftermarket system that we have permission to connect to and that we have worked together with the system's developer to integrate.
** By smart, we mean one that can be controlled by an app on your phone. 



Our first partner in this space is an exciting early stage company which is doing very cool things in the car sharing space.  They have been testing their original system all over the World this past year and have recently launched the newest version of their smart auto start / keyless entry system called MoboKey.
Once the system is installed in your vehicle, OmniFob will be able to control the various MoboKey functions depending upon which version you have.
MoboKey comes in three versions:

 MoboKey Basic - Basic keyless entry LOCK/UNLOCK @ $70 + shipping. DIY installation.
 MoboKey Plus - Advanced keyless entry LOCK/UNLOCK @ $90 + shipping. DIY installation.
 MoboKey Pro - Keyless entry LOCK/UNLOCK plus remote start and car sharing @ $150 + shipping. Requires professional installation.

For more information on each of the above, please visit mobokey.com, or contact them directly at (713) 701-5748.
We will be sending out an EXCLUSIVE discount courtesy of MoboKey to all of our backers at the conclusion of our campaign.

We are also working with Blue Eclipse, a startup founded by a pioneer in the connected car space who helped develop the first commercially available connected car app at Delphi Automotive. BluRemote by Blue Eclipse (due out in early 2020) offers connected control of OEM and aftermarket remote functions for any car, garage door, or home security alarm without the need for professional installation. DIY installation is simple and requires only a few minutes to configure. For a car, you simply place your remote in a small box, place the box securely in the vehicle (can be hidden or locked down), and you will have access to all of the fob's functions through both OmniFob and the BluRemote app.
Here is a little video sample of this exciting device.

 
This is Only the Beginning...
These are just the first two of what we hope will be several compatible aftermarket systems. If you have one of them already - like Viper SmartStart, Compustar DroneMobile, Completely Keyless, Voyo, etc. - contact them through their website and on social to let them know that you want it to work with OmniFob. The more they hear from you, the greater chance we have of moving up their priority list.
From there, we hope that integration with OEMs will not be far behind.
 

Having a device separate from the phone that doesn't attract as much attention is a valuable thing when it comes to personal security. In the case of an assault for example, the assailant's first order of business will be to get your phone away from you so that you cannot contact anyone. Having access to a panic button that is separate and that can trigger an event on your phone like texting or calling emergency services, a friend, or family, or even all of them can be critical at such a time. 
Several single function panic buttons are already popular on college campuses, for exercising by yourself, for late night walks, and for jobs that can take you to out-of-the way locations and in contact with strangers like a real estate agent.  OmniFob combines it with a range of other functionality so that you don't have to carry multiple devices.

OmniFob pairs to both the Keyport app and the Chipolo app (for locator specific functionality) on your smartphone. Once set up, the commands you issue by selecting the function and then clicking the button on your OmniFob will be sent via Bluetooth to the requisite app which will then initiate your request. For example, to open your garage door, you select the Garage Door - Open/Close function with the Mode button on the side and then click the Select button which initiates the command. The Keyport app receives the command via Bluetooth, determines which function to call, and then initiates the action via API through the cloud.

 Setting up your OmniFob is simple. After pairing OmniFob with the Keyport app on your phone, just click Add Device and all the compatible devices you have already set up appear as available devices.  Just tap it and name it, and it will be available almost instantly on your OmniFob.
Add, remove, and modify your configuration in the app at any time.
You can even share device functionality with other OmniFob users in your household or office.

Out of the gate, OmniFob will be compatible with a wide range of devices through Samsung SmartThings and Yonomi, which includes most items that are compatible with the Wink hub, as well as a handful of direct connections to great partners like Chipolo, MoboKey, and Nexx Garage (Amazon's most popular Smart Garage Door Opener).
 
 


 

Alongside smart home, connected car, and personal security, OmniFob has incorporated a built-in Bluetooth locator powered by Chipolo so you can find your OmniFob from your phone... or find your phone from your OmniFob.
And it too works with Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa. 

Find OmniFob with Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant
After testing several Bluetooth trackers, we were convinced that the team at Chipolo not only knew exactly what they were doing, but they are just awesome to work with. Based in Europe with an outpost in NYC, the Chipolo team has developed several award-winning locators including the Chipolo Classic, Chipolo Plus, and the Chipolo Card.
We will be sending out a discount code courtesy of Chipolo to all of our backers at the conclusion of our campaign.


Trying to take the perfect selfie is not exactly the suavest of moves. Now you can use OmniFob as a remote camera trigger so that you can do it without looking like a tourist.


A tiny keychain flashlight is always a useful everyday carry item.  To give you one that doesn't take up any additional space, we added a mini-flashlight for shining a little light when you need it most.
MULTIPLE CARRY OPTIONS
While IoT is gaining ground, the vast majority of us still carry some form of a keychain. Keys are not going away anytime soon, and our key rings are chock-full of other everyday carry items as well - pocket tools (e.g. mini-flashlight, bottle opener, pocketknife), auto and access fobs, security tokens, contactless payment options, loyalty cards, etc. At Keyport, our mission is to add some organization to the chaos and to transform your keychain from an unwieldy collection of physical items into a fully customizable, modern day, connected multi-tool for the modern lifestyle.

OmniFob has multiple carry options besides clipping it to your pocket or bag,
A part of the Keyport modular everyday carry system, OmniFob is compatible with the Keyport's Anywhere Pocket Clip™ (comes standard and can connect to virtually any keychain), the Keyport Pivot™, and the Keyport Slide™.

Before we go into specifics, here are a few general things about OmniFob's security:

No biometrics
No direct device connections
No private data stored on the device
No history stored on the device
No unencrypted transfer of data

OmniFob does not connect directly to your devices. It simply connects to the Keyport app on your smartphone via Bluetooth and acts as a shortcut to your smart apps. It’s that simple. All the work is done app to app, by your smartphone, just as if you are controlling your devices directly from your smartphone. When you press a button to activate a device, scene, or routine on the OmniFob, it sends a signal via Bluetooth to the Keyport App on your phone. Our app sends the command to the 3rd party app, which then triggers the action and... voila. 

In the Keyport App, you connect to a compatible 3rd party app via Oauth2 validation. Once your account is linked, the devices, scenes, and routine names you have programmed in the 3rd party app automatically populate in the Keyport app. The only information written to your OmniFob is the custom names you select for each device, scene, and routine.
What if I lose it? There is no need to worry about security if you ever lose your OmniFob. It is designed to be a shortcut to your smart phone via Bluetooth. Therefore, OmniFob will not work if it is out of Bluetooth range of your phone and the Keyport app to which it is paired. So, a potential thief would literally have to get a hold of it and be within your smart phone’s Bluetooth bubble (approximately 60 feet) for it to re-pair with your phone.
But we have a simple solution for that too. Just unpair it in the Keyport app and all your devices will be inoperable even if the thief finds his way back into your Bluetooth bubble.
In comes Chipolo - And lost doesn't mean forever with OmniFob... You will still be able to track it down via our locator powered by Chipolo and its crowd mesh network which shows its last known location. You can check it right on Chipolo's app.
But, let’s say you totally lost it and un-paired it from the Keyport app as described above. Guess what? It is still connected to Chipolo so you can mark your OmniFob as lost in the Chipolo app and you will have a chance at finding it again using their Community Search feature. When you get it back you can easily re-pair it with the Keyport app.
Anonymity - Imagine, you leave your keys somewhere and someone finds them. That person now has access to your car, house, office, and any other keys you have on there. But, unless you have your address on your keys, they are anonymous, right? Most likely, that person is just going to be a good samaritan and turn them into the lost and found. The slim chance that person would become a potential thief is eliminated with OmniFob, because when you un-pair it from the app as described above, it becomes useless.
Testing Before Launch - In addition to the initiatives we have undertaken during design, we are already putting OmniFobs in the hands of our partners, beta testers, and white hat hackers (some of our security professional friends from DEFCON) to identify any potential issues. We will continue to study best practices and develop a community which helps us to discover and then patch any potential vulnerabilities as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Something that will really catch people’s eyes and set you apart?Kind of like “cufflinks” for every button on your shirt… Intriguing, right? Or, perhaps you’re a practical person – and you simply want buttons that won’t EVER let you down! Buttons that never come loose. Never fall off (at the worst possible time, too). Never break from washing, drying, ironing, or dry cleaning. Well, get ready, because Auxilry are…Interchangeable shirt buttons are currently available in either brass and polymer with high polish, painted, sprayed or oiled finishes.The fasteners are made with medical grade high crystalline polymer, that can withstand some of the strongest chemicals and highest temperatures.Lifetime GuaranteeIf any part of your interchangeable shirt button should fail to function properly, or should you lose an interchangeable cap for any reason, I will  replace it for free (except shipping).I’m so excited about my “garment improvement” technology, I’m affectionately calling it “BUTTON – 2.0” – an innovation set to make everyone look their best while looking at their wardrobes in a whole new way! With the Auxilry interchangeable button system, you “swap out” your existing shirt buttons with these amazing high-tech replacements. Because they’re “high tech” (precision engineered), there are only FIVE STEPS and there is absolutely…Most people don’t know how – or else they won’t take the time – to sew on a new shirt button. Taking shirts to the tailor is expensive and time-consuming. People want simple, efficient solutions. So they go out and buy a new shirt! But that gets expensive. With Auxilry buttons, there will be NO MORE button frustration in the world. Button replacements are made of only the highest quality polymers and metals – strong enough to handle repeated washing, dry cleaning, pressing, and stressing. Simply change to the Auxilry interchangeable button system. Problem solved for as long as you own that shirt! Auxilry buttons allow people to get much more utility out of the clothes they already own. And no more buttons to repair! In a few seconds, it changes the entire look of the shirt! “CUSTOMIZE” Your Wardrobe Automatically, With One Fix!My Invisa-Fit collar extender is adjustable and made with clear high quality soft to the skin silicone. Best of all, it works with Auxilry interchangeable shirt buttons and lets you match your shirt buttons as you please! So forget the old unsightly collar extender that you have to constantly take off and put back on, my Auxilrys Invisa-Fit collar extender is always on and never seen. Button up and go! Keep your shirt collars looking sharp! The Auxilry engraved mirror finish collar stays are 2.5cm in length for most standard collar sizes. Like the famous “Power Tie” of the 1990’s, you can have the first “Power Buttons”!You’ll never settle for being seen in tired old “regular” shirt buttons. (We can all agree – they do nothing for you but hold your shirt together!)Why not wear dynamic, interchangeable, attractive buttons that will set you apart?!?You’ll dazzle your prospects and clients… your boss… your friends… your coworkers. Anyone who sees you on a regular basis. They’ll say there’s something special about you – even if they can’t quite put their finger on it.Only your fingers will know the secret! The “magic” to impressing people is in the subtle details of your style and accessories.Customized buttons. Now if that isn’t subtle style detail staring everyone right in the face, I don’t know what is!Auxilry interchangeable buttons go far beyond mere “accessorizing” – the obvious thing everybody already does.  Auxilry buttons, rather, are your subtle, barely-prominent way of standing out without shouting out. In today’s competitive world, the person who stands out for being DIFFERENT and BETTER than their competition is the one who gets chosen to be the WINNER.If you live in that world – in business or socially – you know how important it is to have that “edge” I’ve mentioned. You can feel it.Well, your “signature look” is what they will remember – long after everyone else’s expensive cologne or perfume has worn off.  And, you’ll have a secret edge -- because no one even knows about this yet!I firmly believe Auxilry buttons are the clothing-improvement solution shirt wearers around the world are HUNGRY for.They’re simple. Unique. Elegant. And oh so practical.Your investment today will last a lifetime. And yet, it pays off right away. Not only does the Auxilry interchangeable button system greatly expand the versatility of your current wardrobe (a profit right off the bat!), it achieves things money alone can’t buy. If you want to look cool and hip, simply match your buttons to the occasion – an instant success! Special occasion? No need to rush out and buy something new! (Who can do that every day?) Or perhaps you need to look subdued and business-like. I have the ideal buttons just for work. So now you can wear the same shirt, but make it fit the occasion! Rather than buy more shirts, the Auxilry interchangeable buttons let you turn every shirt in your closet into a “double duty” or “triple duty” shirt!This alone will save you hundreds of dollars a year – maybe more. And still you’ll look like a million bucks!Your “fashion score” with peers – men and women alike – will go through the roof.

We also get a lot of feedback about the improvements for Gligo. We do keep improving and updating the APP about stability of the connection and other parts of the usage. What’s more, there is an update and improvement of Bluetooth and the second generation of Gligo2S is available.We are able to immediately deliver the products to the backers after ordering.The Gligo is over but you can order now the Gligo 2S on our new campaign. We are able to immediately deliver the products to the backers after ordering. You want a smartwatch that respects your time. We created GLIGO to do just that. No crazy/flashy UX and alerts that never stop. We only keep track of the most important things for you throughout the day: check time, meeting reminder, and a little bit of health monitoring and fitness tracking.  While giving you the most comfortable watch-reading experience, GLIGO also has unprecedentedly long battery life. Different from most of the smartwatches on the market that require charges daily, we adopted an energy-efficient dual-core design: the quartz core has a battery life of up to two years, e-ink screen has a battery life of up to 180 days.

 
We strive for simplicity and functionality, and always with style. With GLIGO, you can focus on the things you care the most about. GLIGO’s screen is e-ink, and there is no reflection under the sun like traditional liquid crystal displays have. And it only consumes energy when screen color changes (e.g., switching from black to white). After turning off, images on screen remain, hence very energy-efficient. Another advantage of e-ink screen over traditional liquid crystal display is that it is easy to read. E-ink looks like printed text, making it easier for eyes.​ -Press the bottom-right button on GLIGO and switch between black and white screens freely. Given your environment, choose mature black or chic white.The watch has a two-pin design and is equipped with quartz movement. The e-ink screen displays time, date, and notification icons.GLIGO’s waterproof body can withstand depths up to 30 meters. So now you don't have to worry about taking off your watch when you're showering, at the beach, or working out.Let us first introduce to you the reminder functions under four innovative scenarios. Mobile phone reminders are automatically synced to the watch, and the e-ink screen will display the reminder in different time intervals. For example, if you have an important meeting between 10 am, and 12 pm, the outer circle between 10 and 12 will show white, reminding you that there is a meeting during this period.The display is black or white background; there are agendas reminder lines for next 12 hours (as you see, there are lines around the display edge, when your calendar has tasks in those hours, the display will show a range at that hour).You can set and view your full daily schedule easily. As shown in image above, the watch face shows that you have some upcoming appointments at 11:50 AM, 14:30 PM and 18:30 PM.The screen background is black or white; there’s a ring around the display edge which we called sports amount ring, it goes as your sports amount increase until you fulfill your target sports amount which is set through mobile App.Black or white background, the display shows a digital time or date, which is in sync with your mobile phone time or date through the mobile phone app. So when you travel to different time zone, the display can show time of different time zones.When you have traveled to France from American, GLIGO’s quartz hands show the local current time in US (e.g. 10:10 AM) and its face shows the local current time in French (3:10 PM) at the same time. And it also can show the date in French (Oct. 10th).GLIGO features email alerts, call alerts, and application alerts so that you have to take out your mobile phone or notebook to check them. Life can be simple and easier.The GliGo Watch application allows your GLIGO to connect seamlessly with your phone, enabling you to access stored information in real time, use your GLIGO to take pictures, and program your reminders as well as your mode choices.Quick, convenient magnetic charging technology can be used to provide charging power to the E-ink screen alone; the quartz core has a battery life of up to 2 years.Robust body with streamline makes this smart watch resistant to high temperature, corrosion and tear and wear, allowing for a long lasting use.Do sports with GLIGO. It tracks everything from your steps, running distance and heart rate. It can also remind you to take a rest. Its sleep monitor tracks your sleep patterns - when you go to sleep and wake up.There are two different styles for you to choose from: Classic Leather or Stylish Milanese, don't miss the opportunity to show your style.All silver design fits the most occasions",55.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Our Ultralight shoes drastically reduce the overall drag &amp; weight on your feet - allowing you to feel as if you don't even have shoes on.

<p>Each pair of Kabaccha Shoes is carefully hand-cut in Italy by our brilliant artisan shoe makers. Almost all other brands do this by machine to save time and money. Our CEO, Kabeer, has made sure that we do everything the long and right way.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important steps of making a shoe as everything depends on the skill and precision of cutting the Nappa leather.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480557393/vekg2aeuloyqiehbv5g2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The short clip you see above is just one of many, and we mean many, pieces that go into making just one shoe. All of these steps have to be repeated again for the other half as well.</p>
<p>We are proud to say that every molecule in our shoes is 100% Made in Italy! Our artisanshoemakers treat each shoe like a work of art. They don't stop picking at it until the shoe is perfect.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480557466/yih3ojhhgwkfoclrug2p.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The craftsmen &amp; women in our artisan factory have been making shoes by hand for generations and they've become exceedingly good at it. The skills are passed down from generation to generation, evolving and becoming more efficient every time.</p>
<p>When we say ""Handmade in Italy"", we really mean it... from a piece of leather - to a full shoe - made by hand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480557496/jyrkc4vx5gfix5ek9hxt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We use only the best Italian Nappa Leather. The tanneries we sourced our leather from are environmentally safe as well, as we use Natural Vegetable Tanning processes and don't use harsh chemicals to tan our leather. A lot of brands don't buy their leather from Italian tanneries to save on costs, but Kabaccha Shoes are made from 100% Italian leather bought from tanneries in Tuscany, Italy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480557534/qurrpnhhaer1j35wncyw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Every pair of Kabaccha Shoes is individually tempered into the perfect fit to make them comfortable and durable.  This procedure makes the leather supple but also strengthens the integrity of the shoe. This step is usually skipped by lesser companies to save on costs - but we at Kabaccha went the extra mile.</p>
<p>We also use only PremiumMaterials in all our shoes. We used the best quality laces, best quality stitching and other raw materials. Everything that goes into making a pair of shoes is sourced 100% from Italy.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We give a lot of attention to detail and you will see that the moment you receive your first pair. Before the shoes are shipped off, they are individually checked for imperfections and manually inspected by an experienced artisan to make sure each and everyone of you gets a perfectly matching pair.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480557600/advbhkgsgiiafwhwpoyv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Men &amp; Women artisans that work at our factories in Italy are so skilled at what they do, that they take a lot of pride in their work. It's almost an insult to themselves &amp; their tradition if they make a mistake, so they really go out of their way to make sure they don't make any.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480557618/v0ed0cwgkakzt0pk9blx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once your beautiful shoes are ready, they are put inside out Kabaccha Shoe boxes. We were so picky about having everything made in Italy that we even got our boxes made there.</p>

<p>The box is made from a very high quality heavy stock materials and you will feel this the moment you receive the box. We think of our selves as a high end brand, so we wanted to have all the attributes of a high end brand. In our last campaign, many of our backers complimented our packaging and box and compared us to the likes of Apple!</p>
<p>With our direct to consumer model, we cut out the middle man and make our prices affordable and fair. Other Italian brands have a lot of markups, so you end up paying a lot more for what the shoes are really worth.</p>
<p>Our shoes will be worth a lot more once they go on retail on our website. Now is your chance to get the shoes for 30-50% OFF! </p>

<p>Kabaccha Shoes are true to size. When choosing your size, stick with your usual dress shoe size. We've made our shoes with a wider than normal Italian shoe. Doing this gives your feet more room to breathe, makes our shoes a lot more comfortable and allows all kinds of feet to fit effortlessly. We will send you a survey at the end of the campaign to find out your exact size. If they don't fit - don't worry - we'll exchange them for ya!</p>
<p>Size 14/15/16. We offer large sizes, but the leather/materials required to make them requires an aditional cost. Please increase your pledge by 40$ if you are a size 14/15/16.. Please message us if you have any questions!</p>

<p>Kabaccha Shoes is a fun brand, but we take our shoes very seriously. We wanted to make the most visually appealing shoes ever seen, and the most comfortable shoes ever worn. We knew we had to do something spectacular to live up to that, so we put together a talented team and all the passion in this world to make that happen.</p>
<p>Our founder, Kabeer Arora, is a thoroughbred shoe designer &amp; comes from a bloodline of shoemakers. He's spent many years in shoe factories all over the world gaining real world experience and has professionally studied footwear design in London and Italy. </p>
<p>In 2015, Kabaccha shoes successfully completed a kickstarter campaign and became one of the most successful campaigns in crowdfunding history. Our campaign opened doors and lead the way for so many other campaigns, who followed in our footsteps. It's been an incredible journey!</p>

Kabaccha Shoes redefine the age old boring black dress shoe - by adding a modern twist, new technologies and a splash of color. We make Modern Shoes for Modern Men & Women.

 

 

These are the 2017 Kabaccha Men's and Women's Collection. We have three styles: The Wingtip, the Loafer & the Driver Mocassin. We focused our efforts on these three styles because they are the must have shoes in any wardrobe.
We've made them in many beautiful colorways for every type of personality. Whether you're going to work or a night out - we have every style and color you can imagine.

 

The visually striking 2017 Men’s Wingtipis our creative reinvention of Kabaccha’s Original Men’s Wingtip. The classic brogue designs, that reference long-standing traditions of men fashion, are accentuated by our signature variations of color that further transform this highlystylized design.
The Men’s Wingtip is made for the risk-taker and aspiring creative with an affinity for redefinition. Timelesselegance and striking details make this shoe the perfect statement piece for formal, professional and evening ensembles. Below are a selection of 10 colorways to pick from!

 


You also have the choice between the Wedge Heel & the Classic Heel. We've received lots of feedback from our backers about which one they want. When we send out the survey - we'll ask you which one you prefer! This effects only the Men's Loafer & Wingtips!

Our Modern Man’s Loafer finds its roots in a timeless and elegant shoe design, reimagined to introduce an elevated standard of comfort and versatility. The classictassel, in combination with our wide selection of inspiring colors, creates a unique blend of classic and urban, risk-taking style. 
Lightweight soles and fine Italian leather handled by highly trained artisans have allowed us to create durable, ultralight, and comfortable formal footwear that will add an element of personality to the basic black tux, elevating your style to be anything but ordinary. Below are a selection of 6 colorways to pick from!

Kabaccha’s Women’s Wingtipis derived from the shape of the time-honored Men’s Wingtip. Feminine accents soften its silhouette to be paired with anything from jeans to dresses. Classic brogue designs are accentuated by our signature variations of color that further transform this highly stylized design. 
The lightweight, white soles and patent, pastel leathers will add an element of feminine grace to any style. Timeless eleganceand striking details make this shoe the must-have statement piece for everyday looks or the perfect match for formal, professional and evening ensembles. 

 

 
 

The 2017 Women’s Mocassinis the embodiment of Kabaccha’s mission to balance effortless and eye-catchingstyle with our higher standard of comfort. Hand-tailored to fit the needs of every woman on the go, our Women’s Mocassin pays tribute to the classic Driver style with a uniquely Kabaccha twist. 
Brought to you in a variety of versatile and expressivecolors, our Moccasins will add an element of personality and excitement to your everyday ensemble while their lightweight soles and fine Italian leather will keep you comfortable and on the move.


 


 

Our Ultralight shoes drastically reduce the overall drag & weight on your feet - allowing you to feel as if you don't even have shoes on. Shoes now a days are heavy and not very easy on your feet - we wanted to change this because there are so many new materials available. Using these revolutionary materials makes the shoe so much more comfortable even after a long day.

 
The Sole we used in our 2017Men's Wingtip and Loafer hasevolved tremendously from our original collection. We listened to all the feedback we received, and went back to the drawing board. 
We made the sole 75% stronger sole that is much more durable and longer lasting while still keeping the light weightfactor to it. We've designed it in a way that you can comfortablywalk for years without the shoe loosing tread or grip.
 

 

Each pair of Kabaccha Shoes is carefully hand-cut in Italy by our brilliant artisan shoe makers. Almost all other brands do this by machine to save time and money. Our CEO, Kabeer, has made sure that we do everything the long and right way.
This is one of the most important steps of making a shoe as everything depends on the skill and precision of cutting the Nappa leather.

The short clip you see above is just one of many, and we mean many, pieces that go into making just one shoe. All of these steps have to be repeated again for the other half as well.
We are proud to say that every molecule in our shoes is 100% Made in Italy! Our artisanshoemakers treat each shoe like a work of art. They don't stop picking at it until the shoe is perfect.

The craftsmen & women in our artisan factory have been making shoes by hand for generations and they've become exceedingly good at it. The skills are passed down from generation to generation, evolving and becoming more efficient every time.
When we say ""Handmade in Italy"", we really mean it... from a piece of leather - to a full shoe - made by hand.

We use only the best Italian Nappa Leather. The tanneries we sourced our leather from are environmentally safe as well, as we use Natural Vegetable Tanning processes and don't use harsh chemicals to tan our leather. A lot of brands don't buy their leather from Italian tanneries to save on costs, but Kabaccha Shoes are made from 100% Italian leather bought from tanneries in Tuscany, Italy.

Every pair of Kabaccha Shoes is individually tempered into the perfect fit to make them comfortable and durable.  This procedure makes the leather supple but also strengthens the integrity of the shoe. This step is usually skipped by lesser companies to save on costs - but we at Kabaccha went the extra mile.
We also use only PremiumMaterials in all our shoes. We used the best quality laces, best quality stitching and other raw materials. Everything that goes into making a pair of shoes is sourced 100% from Italy.
 

We give a lot of attention to detail and you will see that the moment you receive your first pair. Before the shoes are shipped off, they are individually checked for imperfections and manually inspected by an experienced artisan to make sure each and everyone of you gets a perfectly matching pair.

The Men & Women artisans that work at our factories in Italy are so skilled at what they do, that they take a lot of pride in their work. It's almost an insult to themselves & their tradition if they make a mistake, so they really go out of their way to make sure they don't make any.

Once your beautiful shoes are ready, they are put inside out Kabaccha Shoe boxes. We were so picky about having everything made in Italy that we even got our boxes made there.

The box is made from a very high quality heavy stock materials and you will feel this the moment you receive the box. We think of our selves as a high end brand, so we wanted to have all the attributes of a high end brand. In our last campaign, many of our backers complimented our packaging and box and compared us to the likes of Apple!
With our direct to consumer model, we cut out the middle man and make our prices affordable and fair. Other Italian brands have a lot of markups, so you end up paying a lot more for what the shoes are really worth.
Our shoes will be worth a lot more once they go on retail on our website. Now is your chance to get the shoes for 30-50% OFF! 

Our direct to consumer business model enables us to cut out the middle man and keep our prices low. We should be selling our shoes for $500, but we want to build a brand that makes luxuryaffordable.

From our artisan factories - straight to your feet. Kabaccha Shoes will always put you over making a profit like most other brands. We are happy with the way things are with our prices and won't ever lose our valuesor forget where we came from.

We've carefully thought out each reward and broken it down to make it simple for you. Those prices are 30-50% off Retail! Look over the rewards and read the pledge descriptions for more details. If you have any questions please feel free to ask us in the comments section and we'll do our best to answer them for you.


Here is a pretty accuratetimeline that we predict. Having been through an extremely large campaign last year, our factory is much more prepared this year for an even biggercampaign. If all goes according to plan we should be shipping your shoes out by Feb/March. 



 


 
Kabaccha Shoes are true to size. When choosing your size, stick with your usual dress shoe size. We've made our shoes with a wider than normal Italian shoe. Doing this gives your feet more room to breathe, makes our shoes a lot more comfortable and allows all kinds of feet to fit effortlessly. We will send you a survey at the end of the campaign to find out your exact size. If they don't fit - don't worry - we'll exchange them for ya!
Size 14/15/16. We offer large sizes, but the leather/materials required to make them requires an aditional cost. Please increase your pledge by 40$ if you are a size 14/15/16.. Please message us if you have any questions!

 

Kabaccha Shoes is a fun brand, but we take our shoes very seriously. We wanted to make the most visually appealing shoes ever seen, and the most comfortable shoes ever worn. We knew we had to do something spectacular to live up to that, so we put together a talented team and all the passion in this world to make that happen.
Our founder, Kabeer Arora, is a thoroughbred shoe designer & comes from a bloodline of shoemakers. He's spent many years in shoe factories all over the world gaining real world experience and has professionally studied footwear design in London and Italy. 
In 2015, Kabaccha shoes successfully completed a kickstarter campaign and became one of the most successful campaigns in crowdfunding history. Our campaign opened doors and lead the way for so many other campaigns, who followed in our footsteps. It's been an incredible journey!

We only use premium-quality, natural leather in our products to promise great performance. To ensure the Craftmark Belt meets our high standard, the vegetable-tanned side of the belt is made of full-grain leather. This high-grade, moisture-resistant leather has an extremely tight grain, making it durable and breathable. With a minimal amount of treatment, the vegetable-tanned leather is hand-stained with natural pigments and eco-solvents to produce an astounding color.</p><p>By using tannic acids naturally found in bark, branches, leaves, fruits and other plant species, vegetable tanning leather is one of the most natural and environmentally friendly ways to produce a rich, classic color.

Frequent travels are common, and external meetings require him to look dapper and groomed. At the same time, he favors a smart casual look for daily work life and also for socializing after work and on weekends. He prefers to keep things simple and minimize belt clutter both at home and while traveling. In addition, heavy meals can cause discomfort as belts sometimes have a tendency to feel too tight after eating. What he needed was a stylish and versatile belt that could provide micro-adjustments, very discreetly, to provide relief and comfort. The Craftmark Belt by Barnns was conceptualized to solve these issues, to inspire through innovation and to simplify life.</p><div data-id=""23742580""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1550689196/flczpscxm4smcauzqpit.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""23646303""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""24000259""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><a href=""https://blog.producthype.co/?ref=CraftmarkKS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1550689198/jtikxt5mdmryruo5e5un.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></p>

You can easily swap between premium hand stained vegetable-tanned leather and sophisticated cowhide Saffiano leather, to suit any occasion, with a simple swivel of the buckle.Compared to other conventional reversible belts, the Craftmark Belt's unique magnetic buckle mechanism requires no pulling and twisting or manual unscrewing, which saves time and reduces the possibility of damage.The Craftmark Belt's easy twist buckle makes switching from work to play easy and effortless. 
CRAFTMARK BELT VS OTHER BELTS
 We source our leather carefully. We only use premium-quality, natural leather in our products to promise great performance. To ensure the Craftmark Belt meets our high standard, the vegetable-tanned side of the belt is made of full-grain leather. This high-grade, moisture-resistant leather has an extremely tight grain, making it durable and breathable. With a minimal amount of treatment, the vegetable-tanned leather is hand-stained with natural pigments and eco-solvents to produce an astounding color.By using tannic acids naturally found in bark, branches, leaves, fruits and other plant species, vegetable tanning leather is one of the most natural and environmentally friendly ways to produce a rich, classic color. This artisanal process is”chromium-free,” promising to eliminate the typical harsh, harmful chemicals used in the standard dying processes.Because of this, the Craftmark Belt will age beautifully over time like a “fine wine”, even when worn daily.Stylish and high-quality Saffiano leather was chosen with versatility and class in mind.Rock this look to a sophisticated, urbane, elegant and sleek event. 
The Craftmark Belt can be more than just two belts in one...Create your own unique belts that match your style using an array of interchangeable leather belt bodies and quality stainless steel buckles from the collection.


  
 The Craftmark Belt was inspired by Adelene’s husband who leads a busy jet setting lifestyle as a tech executive. Frequent travels are common, and external meetings require him to look dapper and groomed. At the same time, he favors a smart casual look for daily work life and also for socializing after work and on weekends. He prefers to keep things simple and minimize belt clutter both at home and while traveling. In addition, heavy meals can cause discomfort as belts sometimes have a tendency to feel too tight after eating. What he needed was a stylish and versatile belt that could provide micro-adjustments, very discreetly, to provide relief and comfort. The Craftmark Belt by Barnns was conceptualized to solve these issues, to inspire through innovation and to simplify life.  
  We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make the Craftmark Belt a reality.We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or purchase a belt, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!

<h1>                   The Story</h1>
<div>Established in December of 2014, Savage Village started as a young grassroots urban outfitter drawing inspiration for designs from pop culture, horror films, to skateboarding, punk, hip hop and other genres of music. We've seen tremendous success since then and we have learned a great deal. While all of us here have had fun producing new t-shirt designs as well as stickers, hats and lapel pins, we have always wanted to push our creativity to the next level to offer our customers more, which is hand made garments using high quality textiles and materials. </div>

<div>(Photo courtesy of us, hell yeah)</div>
<p>There has been so many products that we've tried again and again. some materials we've been very satisfied with, while others just weren't things that we thought were great to begin with. Through a lot of trial and error, we can finally say we are where our taste is, what made us want to start this movement in the first place. We want to inspire others to follow their ambitions, and to never give up, even when it seems like the odds are against you.</p>

<h3>About Set Apart Clothing</h3>
<p>Hey, my name is Zachary Martinez, and I'm hoping to start a Christian clothing design company with the help of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are inspired by Romans 12:2 ""<span>Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.""</span>
</li>
<li><span> This is a ministry all around giving glory to God.</span></li>
<li><span>We aim to give some of the profits to community, local churches, and missionaries. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Basics:</p>
<p>For this project to become a reality we will need to raise at least $500, and God-willing, even more. This money will be used to print the t-shirts, crew necks, sweatshirts, and more. Eventually we hope to upgrade our design process, add more products, and gain more recognition and support for Set Apart. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our intended goal, the money raised will still be put into the project. If more money is raised, the extra will be put into even more clothing, and support of missionaries all around the world.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Just by donating you will impact our ministry massively:</p>
<p>The more donations, the more recognition (of God, and Set Apart)</p>
<p>If someone is wearing Set Apart designs, it is more likely they may have a chance to share the Word with someone who may not know.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have any money to donate, you can help in many ways:</p>
<p>Get the word out about Set Apart and spread the Gospel! It's all for God's glory. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks, Zachary Martinez - Set Apart Clothing</p>

Eventually we hope to upgrade our design process, add more products, and gain more recognition and support for Set Apart. 
If we do not reach our intended goal, the money raised will still be put into the project. If more money is raised, the extra will be put into even more clothing, and support of missionaries all around the world.  


The Impact
Just by donating you will impact our ministry massively:
The more donations, the more recognition (of God, and Set Apart)
If someone is wearing Set Apart designs, it is more likely they may have a chance to share the Word with someone who may not know.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have any money to donate, you can help in many ways:
Get the word out about Set Apart and spread the Gospel! It's all for God's glory.

<p>The company
started on 2012. Everything was born when Luis ordered a customized helmet. It
came along a helmet bag that didn't look like the new helmet. Then he wondered:
why can't I have a helmet cover that looks like my helmet? This very first idea
set everything in motion because we wanted to improve the existant helmet covers on the market.</p>
<p>We worked in 2
lines of products in parallel: helmet covers for motorcycle helmets and helmet
covers for horse riding helmets. The first prototypes were made in leather. The
quality of the final product was very good, but the associated costs were also
high.</p>
<p>We managed to
launch the horse riding range:</p>

<p>But it wasn't a
success.... So we decided to center our efforts in the motorcycle line because
the range of potential customers is wider.</p>
<p>We finished the
leather helmet covers. The result was fantastic but if wasn't that useful, the
leather is rigid and, if you don't want to damage it, you cannot fold
it. </p>

<p>At this point
(more than a year ago) we started working with different kinds of cloth, and we
ended up choosing polyester, because it allows using the sublimation technique and it is
easy to work with. We followed this path and after lots of different
prototypes and designs we managed to finish the helmet covers that you have
already seen.</p>

<p>Now we have
managed to finish most of the prototypes (we have some work in progress

<p>We lack the proper machinery. Now we are producing everything with a
plotter modified to do sublimation and a small heat press. In order to do
a proper production we need a sublimation printer and a thermic  pressure
calander, we would like to purchase these two machines:</p>

<p>We have been
working for more than two years developing OHCOVER helmet covers and and now
the product is ready for production. The next steps that we have to follow are

</ul></div>","What is OHCOVER 
OHCOVER is a new
stylish and comfortable way to carry your motorcycle helmet.
OHCOVER is a new
kind of foldable helmet bag that can be worn as a backpack, as cross-body, as hobo bag or as a slanted tote.  
You will hardly
find a bag like ours because our products are registered in Europe, USA and
Canada.


""A great idea, it is very useful if you need to carry another helmet while riding a bike."" - Carlos Cardús - 250cc World Championship racer
""An interesting and practical proposal but also elegant and fun"" - Josep Lluís Merlos - Radio Marca journalist (20th of October 2014)

Why is useful our helmet cover? Watch the following video made by ourselves:


 General specifications 
 A helmet cover that folds into itself 
That's it,
simply. You can fold the cover into its inner pocket and you need less than 1
minute to do it!. This way, its size is very small and you can put it anywhere
you want.

 One bag that can be worn in 4 different ways 
You can carry
the helmet the way that you prefer: as a backpack, as cross-body as a  hobo or as a slanted tote. We have developed a side buckle that allows
you a fast change between the configurations.
 Lots of different designs 
In order to
achieve great quality in terms of designs and colours we use sublimation
technique (Sublimation technique - Wikipedia). This way, we can transfer the designs made on the PC into the polyester
cloth (How sublimation works - Youtube).We have developed different design ranges so you can find the one that fits you the
best.







CITY: it is our main line. Lots of different products for lots of different tastes




Supersport:
Inspired by the supersport motorcycles





Custom: Based on
the classical custom bikes





Race: Designs based
on actual designs from great all time pilots





OHH!!: Some of the CITY line put into a helmet bag for jet helmets







 Handmade in Barcelona 
Barcelona means sun, architecture, Mediterranean way
of live… but it also means textile know-how. It has 200+ years in textile
manufacturing experience. For this reason we work alongside local manufacturers
so we can have the best possible product. 

 Other specifications 
In OHCOVER we
take care of every detail, even the smallest ones:

All the covers have a protective stripe that
     prevents the helmet from being scratched by the zipper.
We use thick thread that strengthens the seams.
We have developed side buckles that allow a quick
     change between the backpack and the other configurations.
The zipper puller is made on hard rubber so it
     cannot damage your helmet by accident.
All the different designs are registered in
     Europe, USA and Canada. 


                                         
 Product range
We have
completely developed 3 lines of products plus the personalized products:


EVO ADAPTABLE:  full face's helmet cover with adaptive elements, waterproof and available in 3 different
     sizes. 


















GALAXY NEO: flexible
     helmet cover, water-repellent and available in 2 different sizes. 








OHH!!dry:  waterproof
     helmet cover available in a only size.


OHH!!neo: flexible helmet cover, water-repellent and available in a only size.



Personalized: We are open to personalize all of our products. We can modify an existing design or we can
create a completely new design for you. For example the following design was
made for Wayne Gardner (500cc World Champion).





 PERKS 
















 THE COMPANY 
The company
started on 2012. Everything was born when Luis ordered a customized helmet. It
came along a helmet bag that didn't look like the new helmet. Then he wondered:
why can't I have a helmet cover that looks like my helmet? This very first idea
set everything in motion because we wanted to improve the existant helmet covers on the market.
We worked in 2
lines of products in parallel: helmet covers for motorcycle helmets and helmet
covers for horse riding helmets. The first prototypes were made in leather. The
quality of the final product was very good, but the associated costs were also
high.
We managed to
launch the horse riding range:



But it wasn't a
success.... So we decided to center our efforts in the motorcycle line because
the range of potential customers is wider.
We finished the
leather helmet covers. The result was fantastic but if wasn't that useful, the
leather is rigid and, if you don't want to damage it, you cannot fold
it. 



At this point
(more than a year ago) we started working with different kinds of cloth, and we
ended up choosing polyester, because it allows using the sublimation technique and it is
easy to work with. We followed this path and after lots of different
prototypes and designs we managed to finish the helmet covers that you have
already seen.
WHERE ARE WE AND WHY WE NEED YOU 
Now we have
managed to finish most of the prototypes (we have some work in progress
products) and we are ready to start the production. But there are some points that we need to solve first.
We lack the proper machinery. Now we are producing everything with a
plotter modified to do sublimation and a small heat press. In order to do
a proper production we need a sublimation printer and a thermic  pressure
calander, we would like to purchase these two machines:


Even tough these
two machines aren't the top of the market, they would make 8 times faster our
production process.
As we said before, we want to work in Barcelona because there are lots of experts and good workers who know a lot about textile and because producing everything here lets us control all the production steps. We already have our main manufacturer that will provide us the cloth and we already have two groups of workers that will sew the helmet covers.

 RISKS AND CHALLENGES 
We have been
working for more than two years developing OHCOVER helmet covers and and now
the product is ready for production. The next steps that we have to follow are
the acquisition of the two needed machines and to bond business deals with the
different manufacturers and shops/resellers that we have already contacted.

<p>The regular Corda Rope Sandals are made 100% out of rope. The rope is melted together forming a very strong bond, while staying soft and comfortable. It is quite durable but after some good use they may start to fray on the bottom. You can just bust out your scissors and trim it off, or burn it back with a lighter. </p>

<p>It is not an easy task setting up this kind of a project in a sub-Saharan African country. That is why I wanted to go over there first, overcome all the necessary obstacles and get the ball rolling. We are already producing a small amount of sandals daily, so you can be confident you will get yours! Each pair is made entirely by hand, so if there are defects, we will replace them for you at no extra cost!</p>
<p>All you have to do is support this project, help deserving people to have an opportunity to get ahead in life, snag yourself a pair of Corda Rope Sandals at a great price and wait for them to come in the mail!  The early orders we should be able to fill within a few weeks of this campaign, later orders may take a few months, but as we expand our operation we are confident you will have your comfortable Corda sandals in time for your spring adventures!</p>

In 2013 I quit my job, sold everything I had and went on a journey to find a more meaningful path in life. While backpacking Europe I met a person who was helping 1500 orphans in Ethiopia to get off the streets and into schools. She told me even though they were able to educate these orphans, after they turned 18, many were still in poverty as there were no jobs or opportunities for them. She asked if I could help.
So this year I went to Ethiopia and spent 3 months teaching 8 underprivileged people how to make my favorite sandals as a way to support themselves, and now I am turning to you to join me in making a difference. Pick yourself up a pair of these amazing rope sandals and share this with your friends, and together we can make a lasting difference in their lives and many more as we expand our operation. 
There are an estimated 150,000 orphans and underprivileged children living on the streets of Ethiopia. Some of the lucky ones will get placed into orphanages where they will have a better home and a chance to go to school. But even these kids are displaced from this support system when they turn 18, leaving them once again alone and desperate as there just aren't enough jobs or opportunities for them.It is our goal to invest directly into the lives of these talented youth, and others in similar situations, by not only giving them a well paying job, paying 3X the average local wages, but teaching them the business and life skills they need to succeed, keeping them and their families out of poverty for good.  At Corda we provide the opportunities these underprivileged people need by teaching them how to make the worlds coolest sandals out of rope! Providing them with a well paying job is just the first step. Our goal is to empower them to be able to start their own businesses, creating even more opportunities and jobs in their local communities. With your support, we will be able to offer them English classes, computer classes and teach them basic business skills. Corda is also providing the hands on experience of starting and growing a business as they participate in all facets of growing Corda in their local community. For this reason we really wanted a product they could sell in their local market, a shoe that was easy to make that was also fashionable, durable, versatile and affordable.

They are currently making adult whole sizes between 5 and 13. And now we need your help. We are turning to you to try out these comfy and unique sandals at a great price and help us reach our goals!
Goals


$10,000:  The minimum we need to really get started. This provides the funding to pay for the rope, hand tools, equipment and wages needed for the 8 people we've hired for the next 6 months.


$20,000: The funding needed to get into a larger facility, provide opportunities and jobs for 6 more deserving people who desperately need them, and the equipment and tools needed to expand into making Kid's sizes and the ability to add recycled tire soles! This will also enable us to increase our supply capabilities to get into new markets and start selling the sandals wholesale to retail shops. 


$30,000: Provide opportunities and well paying jobs for 6 more amazing people, as well as the funding needed to formalize and implement our program to teach basic business skills, English classes, computer lessons and provide micro-loans to start their own business, which not only allows someone else to take their place at Corda, but creates even more jobs in their community.


  
The regular Corda Rope Sandals are made 100% out of rope. The rope is melted together forming a very strong bond, while staying soft and comfortable. It is quite durable but after some good use they may start to fray on the bottom. You can just bust out your scissors and trim it off, or burn it back with a lighter. 

Adding a sole made 100% from recycled tires is not only good for the environment, but makes your sandals more durable and last longer. Add an extra layer of protection for your more rugged activities. 



It is not an easy task setting up this kind of a project in a sub-Saharan African country. That is why I wanted to go over there first, overcome all the necessary obstacles and get the ball rolling. We are already producing a small amount of sandals daily, so you can be confident you will get yours! Each pair is made entirely by hand, so if there are defects, we will replace them for you at no extra cost!
All you have to do is support this project, help deserving people to have an opportunity to get ahead in life, snag yourself a pair of Corda Rope Sandals at a great price and wait for them to come in the mail!  The early orders we should be able to fill within a few weeks of this campaign, later orders may take a few months, but as we expand our operation we are confident you will have your comfortable Corda sandals in time for your spring adventures!

My experience and background
ensure that I will operate a company that you will be proud to back. I have
surrounded myself with some of the brightest, most capable people in the
country. 

I am building a  company that you can be proud to support.

Revolution!
The Dog Ring is the easy way to safely secure your dog around trees, posts, and
poles in seconds. It's lightweight, portable, and engineered to be very strong.





To Use 
Simply open the ring up, put it around the tree (post, pole), slide on the
leash, click it and you're done! It gives your dog a full 360 degrees of safe,
tangle-free area to roam. When you're ready to go, just open the ring, slide
off the leash and you're on your way.




The Dog Ring system is great
for...



Parks
Gardening
BBQ's 
Camping
Hiking
Road trips (rest areas)
Exercising your dog
Sporting events  
Visiting a friend
Keeping your dog safely in the yard
And anywhere else you and your dog can think of






The Ring

The Ring is made of double-thick, kink-resistant, cross-linked polyethylene piping. It will not damage trees or other objects, and is extremely strong.





Dog Ring has a unique latching system that's a joy to use. It snaps together easily with an audible 'click', letting you know the latch is set securely in place.


The Leashes
Our
leashes have been specially designed for use with the Dog Ring. They slide
freely 360 degrees in any direction due to the shape. The full system comes
with both a 16' retractable leash and a 6' fixed leash.





Our leashes are unique and have two patents pending on them. They are unlike anything currently on the market. Most retractable leashes look the same. There are none that stand out when you go to the store. Now you will have a better option. The Dog Ring leashes are made to be high quality, beautiful, and for reliable repeated use. 







Our Retractable leash is made strong with reinforced ABS and stainless steel. It will have a sleek overmold around the entire leash. You will feel the quality the second you use it.  Our products are solid and made to last. All leashes are made with your comfort in mind. This is the most comfortable, ergonomic grip you have ever felt. You will love the feel. As we grow we will continue to release an entire line of stylish leashes that people will quickly come to recognize at the park.

SafetyOur leashes also feature a unique patent-pending Bungee Brake system. 






With
the Bungee Brake and the natural flex of the Ring, your dog will come to a safe
stop at the end of the leash. Dog Ring was designed from the ground up to be
safe for our dogs.



Dog Ring keeps your dog safe from tangled leashes and other dangers. The entire system is constructed of engineering grade materials, and designed for strength and repeated use. The reinforced latch ensures the Ring will not open unexpectedly or accidentally, and the Bungee Brake brings your dog to a gentle stop.

Production

We
wanted to be sure our designs are perfect before investing in the costly
tooling process. We have created more than 10 functional prototypes to test and
refine all aspects of the system. We've selected a manufacturer in the U.S. and
have assembled a talented team to realize this dream.

If We Raise More

We
have designed a full line of unique, high quality products that you and your
dog will love. Any money we raise above our goal will be used to bring you
additional high fashion leashes, as well as design packaging and display items.



If We Raise Less

We have the hard work behind us. Any amount will be put to good use. We can do this in steps if we must, but we absolutely will get these out to you good folks one way or another. All pledge amounts are welcome and will get us closer to production. At all levels of funding we will get this done, albeit pace is directly related to the amount that is raised.

Stretch Goals
$100,000 Able to launch full Dog Ring system pictured here plus molds and minimum order for an additional retractable leash design and one additional fixed leash design AND design packaging and display. 


$150,000Able to launch $100,000 goal, plus one more additional retractable leash and one additional fixed leash and a full array of high quality collars and harnesses. 


$200,000Able to launch all goals above plus full line of high quality dog products such as Dog Rings, collars, harnesses, rope toys, and specialty products including crates, carriers, safety seats, ramps, stairs, etc.





Challenges

This
project has challenges to be sure. Anytime we create a new product, there are
many factors that must be taken into careful consideration. My background makes me uniquely qualified to meet challenges head-on and get to the right
decision quickly. Some of the upcoming challenges will be:


Packaging - Design
Shipping - Distribution System
Supply Chain Management System
Inventory Storage - Fulfillment Centers, Options
Brand Identification - Getting the Word Out 



These are all great challenges to have. With our collective experience and education, our entire team is creating a company that is for the people. As systems are put in place we will be able to fine tune the process to make it as smooth and pleasant an experience for the customer as possible. I have
surrounded myself with some of the brightest people in the country. I will seek
proper counsel before making decisions. Full transparency. We are dedicated to
bringing only the best product to you and your dog.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello! My name is Ian Gormley, and thank you for stopping by to check out our project! I have always had a passion for the arts of all styles and mediums. While I was in highschool I received my first silkscreen as a present and I created my very first t-shirt design. I gave a couple out to my friends and we instantly had people coming up to us asking where they could get one. So I started making more and more of this one basic design right out of my house until I got my very first screen printing position professionally when I was 18. With this new knowledge I was learning, I started to grow my brand and sell at local shows that my friends would play.This was all being funded by myself while trying to maintain college life and a full time job. By starting the brand so early I quickly realized a lot of mistakes I was making on the production and retail end of my business. So I began the journey to learn as much as I can about perfecting my craft and learning the other aspect behind it while in school for business. I would constantly be asked by my friends in bands or by people in the town about making shirts for them or their business, which led me to take on a full screen printing and apparel production side of the business. With this came the birth of Inkwell Apparel Production.</p>
<h1><em>Why We Stand Out</em></h1>
<p>As a clothing brand and a screen printer we try to bring something to the table that other places do not. <strong>As a brand</strong> we keep all of our shirts limited to ensure each customer feels like they have something that is very desired and rare. Some of our designs also have multiple colorways they can select to better suit their style. Special designs our customers can personally select the color of shirt and color of print to make it their own. On special occasions we also feature <em>one-of-a-kind</em> designs and garments for the most dedicated and savvy buyers. But mostly, every garment is ""made to order"" like a fine meal in a high end restaurant  to ensure the utmost care and detail is put into everything we produce.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/376/128/e76b1059fc297b444fc7ee40bec74d61_large.jpeg?1360206559"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>  <strong>As a screen printer</strong> we try to take all customers no matter how large or small the order is, even orders that are commonly pushed aside by most shops. When we first started our brand we ran into all sorts of problems ranging from being turned down, not taken seriously, were overcharged on orders, and received poorly made shirts. At Inkwell we put the same care into every order we receive, whether its 1 piece or 1000. We provide any service one may need in the clothing industry; silk screening, custom packaging, custom hangtags, stickers, sewn in labels, printed labels, individual bagging, embroidery, stickers and other promotional items. On our website we also offer some of our customer's goods that we produce to help them grow while they help us. We try to give our customers the help that we would have wanted when we were starting as a brand, its a tough world out there.</p>
<h1>Why We Are Here</h1>
<p>We have come to you and IndieGoGo to assist us getting to that next step we have been building up to. Our customer demand for our screen printing department has continued to grow over the past months, and we are still taking in more and reaching out to new potential clients. We have come to the point that we cannot keep up with our current equipment and time situation to complete everything efficiently while trying to expand into other departments. With money we have saved and the money our generous backers will be providing, we will be taking our shop to the next level.</p>
<p>With you backing our project + money he have raised/saved we will be able to:</p>
<p>         - Purchase newer, higher quality equipment</p>
<p>         - Develop our in house opperations</p>
<p>         - Build a stock of blank garments</p>
<p>         - Bring our company into our own facility where our business can        flourish </p>
<p>         - Cover all fee's that go along with indiegogo projects</p>
<p>         - Ensure all contributer rewards are fulfilled</p>
<p>         - Create a facility where customers can come in to sit with an artist to bring their idea's to life</p>
<p>         - We will be able to teach printing classes to the public and for students interested in fashion, art or design</p>
<p> *Any money raised exceeding our original goal will be put towards a retail side to our shop where customers can come in and sit down with one of our artists, and create a truly unique, one-of-a-kind garment made just for them. Think of a tattoo shop meets screen printing shop!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Goals</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>If we can reach our goal of $15,000 we will be able to get all of our new equipment, and open up shop and completely fulfill all contributer perks. If we only reach a portion of our goal we will still be able to purchase some better equipment and use them in our current location (my house) until we can move into our facility, while fulfilling all perks. We have a stretch goal of $30,000 in which we can fully develop our custom cut and sew department for our brand and other brands to take advantage of. With our cut and sew department, our customers will also be able to create completely custom wadrobes for themselves, everything made by hand in the U.S.</p>
<h1>Our Perks!</h1>
<p>We have come up with some really cool and original products here! Everything you see as a reward is only being made specially for our backers here on IndieGoGo, some are even hand numbered and will have your name embroidered right on them. We have come up with an original t-shirt design dubbed ""Making Dreams Come True"", because you are not only helping us live our dream, but all the others we help out along the way. If you only have a couple of bucks, we got you covered! For you we have some really awesome wayfarer style sunglasses we made up and even some beverage koozies. For the more elite backers we have limited edition hooded sweatshirts, even real leather/wool letterman jackets! We also compiled some more unique and hands on rewards for those who like to become part of the process and dive into the arts!</p>
<p>    - Both Men's and Women's sizes available, shirts are fashion fit so choose accordingly.</p>
<p>    - If at anypoint during this project you choose a perk, but see a product from our website that you like better, we will be happy to make it for you instead!</p>
<p> *Leave your size and color specifications when finalizing your checkout, we will contact you when we reach our goal to ensure you receive the exact shirt and size you want! </p>

<h1>Our Plans After IndieGoGo</h1>
<p>As our business grows we would like to move more into the cut and sew department of the industry and even the manufacturing process. Two things that are hard to come by in our country now are high quality American made products and good manufacturing jobs. We hope to bring these two together by eventually making all of our products in house from scratch!</p>

<h2><strong>Other Ways To Help</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Even if you are unable to contribute to our project there are still plenty of ways you can help! Have Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram? Even run a fashion blog? We would love any help you could offer even if its simply talking about our project with your friends, sharing our project in your blog or facebook or twitter page! Again, thank all of you for checking us out and supporting us!</p></div>","Hello! My name is Ian Gormley, and thank you for stopping by to check out our project! I have always had a passion for the arts of all styles and mediums. While I was in highschool I received my first silkscreen as a present and I created my very first t-shirt design. I gave a couple out to my friends and we instantly had people coming up to us asking where they could get one. So I started making more and more of this one basic design right out of my house until I got my very first screen printing position professionally when I was 18. With this new knowledge I was learning, I started to grow my brand and sell at local shows that my friends would play.This was all being funded by myself while trying to maintain college life and a full time job. By starting the brand so early I quickly realized a lot of mistakes I was making on the production and retail end of my business. So I began the journey to learn as much as I can about perfecting my craft and learning the other aspect behind it while in school for business. I would constantly be asked by my friends in bands or by people in the town about making shirts for them or their business, which led me to take on a full screen printing and apparel production side of the business. With this came the birth of Inkwell Apparel Production.
Why We Stand Out
As a clothing brand and a screen printer we try to bring something to the table that other places do not. As a brand we keep all of our shirts limited to ensure each customer feels like they have something that is very desired and rare. Some of our designs also have multiple colorways they can select to better suit their style. Special designs our customers can personally select the color of shirt and color of print to make it their own. On special occasions we also feature one-of-a-kind designs and garments for the most dedicated and savvy buyers. But mostly, every garment is ""made to order"" like a fine meal in a high end restaurant  to ensure the utmost care and detail is put into everything we produce.

  As a screen printer we try to take all customers no matter how large or small the order is, even orders that are commonly pushed aside by most shops. When we first started our brand we ran into all sorts of problems ranging from being turned down, not taken seriously, were overcharged on orders, and received poorly made shirts. At Inkwell we put the same care into every order we receive, whether its 1 piece or 1000. We provide any service one may need in the clothing industry; silk screening, custom packaging, custom hangtags, stickers, sewn in labels, printed labels, individual bagging, embroidery, stickers and other promotional items. On our website we also offer some of our customer's goods that we produce to help them grow while they help us. We try to give our customers the help that we would have wanted when we were starting as a brand, its a tough world out there.
Why We Are Here
We have come to you and IndieGoGo to assist us getting to that next step we have been building up to. Our customer demand for our screen printing department has continued to grow over the past months, and we are still taking in more and reaching out to new potential clients. We have come to the point that we cannot keep up with our current equipment and time situation to complete everything efficiently while trying to expand into other departments. With money we have saved and the money our generous backers will be providing, we will be taking our shop to the next level.
With you backing our project + money he have raised/saved we will be able to:
         - Purchase newer, higher quality equipment
         - Develop our in house opperations
         - Build a stock of blank garments
         - Bring our company into our own facility where our business can        flourish 
         - Cover all fee's that go along with indiegogo projects
         - Ensure all contributer rewards are fulfilled
         - Create a facility where customers can come in to sit with an artist to bring their idea's to life
         - We will be able to teach printing classes to the public and for students interested in fashion, art or design
 *Any money raised exceeding our original goal will be put towards a retail side to our shop where customers can come in and sit down with one of our artists, and create a truly unique, one-of-a-kind garment made just for them. Think of a tattoo shop meets screen printing shop!
 
Our Goals
If we can reach our goal of $15,000 we will be able to get all of our new equipment, and open up shop and completely fulfill all contributer perks. If we only reach a portion of our goal we will still be able to purchase some better equipment and use them in our current location (my house) until we can move into our facility, while fulfilling all perks. We have a stretch goal of $30,000 in which we can fully develop our custom cut and sew department for our brand and other brands to take advantage of. With our cut and sew department, our customers will also be able to create completely custom wadrobes for themselves, everything made by hand in the U.S.
Our Perks!
We have come up with some really cool and original products here! Everything you see as a reward is only being made specially for our backers here on IndieGoGo, some are even hand numbered and will have your name embroidered right on them. We have come up with an original t-shirt design dubbed ""Making Dreams Come True"", because you are not only helping us live our dream, but all the others we help out along the way. If you only have a couple of bucks, we got you covered! For you we have some really awesome wayfarer style sunglasses we made up and even some beverage koozies. For the more elite backers we have limited edition hooded sweatshirts, even real leather/wool letterman jackets! We also compiled some more unique and hands on rewards for those who like to become part of the process and dive into the arts!
    - Both Men's and Women's sizes available, shirts are fashion fit so choose accordingly.
    - If at anypoint during this project you choose a perk, but see a product from our website that you like better, we will be happy to make it for you instead!
 *Leave your size and color specifications when finalizing your checkout, we will contact you when we reach our goal to ensure you receive the exact shirt and size you want!

I realized this was the answer to having <b>unique celebrity inspired style on a civilian budget</b>. Then I was deployed with the Army during my college years. I wore a uniform every day and I missed fashion SO much. I missed my civilian style and the ability to express my <b>individuality through clothing and accessories</b>. That is how the idea for Civilian Style was born! </p>

<h2>Most people have a general idea about Fashion Week.. but before we
dig deep into 'Why we're expanding into the New York market', let me
briefly explain <em>Men's</em> Fashion
Week.<br/>
</h2><p>We advocate for a more comprehensive vantage point of menswear in America; we're answering the <b><i>QUESTION</i></b>: how do we assist menswear designers with gaining exposure to a global audience?<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326685/files/20140123210508-aa.jpg?1390539908"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/><em>(American Apparel Face: Michael
Rowles |Control Sector | Photo By:Peter Kasabian)</em></p>The power of a fashion week is that it aggregates interest and support.  Men's
Fashion Week serves the fashion community by allowing any menswear designer to
benefit from resource-sharing among presenting menswear brands.  Shared
resources include venue, staff, vendors, audio/visual, and
production. Participating in Men's Fashion Week requires only a
fraction of the resources that it would typically take a menswear designer to
do a solo show.<br/><p>The main objective for a designer presenting a collection during Men's
Fashion Week is to gain press coverage from menswear fashion editors,
trade newspapers, fashion news media, and bloggers. Centralizing the men's
shows makes attending shows convenient and attractive to fashion media and press by
alleviating the stress of traveling to and fro,  in and out, and across
town to each designer's showcase.</p>
<p><em>For an </em><strong><i>EXAMPLE: </i></strong></p>
<p>Producing a solo show can cost upwards of $30,000.  In our research, we
have not found a proper venue in Manhattan for less than $10k/day.  That
number does not include staffing, AV, communication, production, staging
or any other necessities to produce a to-par runway show in New York
City.  A designer can expect to spend another ten thousand dollars on
audio and visual, anywhere between $5,000-$15,000 to staff the event,
another $5,000-$15,000 on back-house, seating, staging, and the list goes on..</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326825/files/20140123223021-IMG_9284.jpg?1390545021"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">This development of ""Men's Fashion Week"" into New York City is

Week.
We advocate for a more comprehensive vantage point of menswear in America; we're answering the QUESTION: how do we assist menswear designers with gaining exposure to a global audience?(American Apparel Face: Michael

key for many reasons. PRIMARILY, NEW YORK CITY IS A MARKET WHERE WE SEE THE LARGEST BANDWIDTH TO SUPPORT OUR GOAL: TO GAIN UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION FOR AMERICAN MENSWEAR FASHION DESIGNERS.There are more than twice as many the fashion designers in New York City as
there are in The Greater Los Angeles area according to the Bureau of Labor

includes fashion writers, journalists, editors, bloggers, photographers, and

will corroborate that New York City is one of the best environments for
this platform. NEW YORK CITY LENDS TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH FOR A GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED WEEK; WE CONTINUE TO NOTICE TRENDING IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS MENSWEAR ECOSYSTEM.
This platform in NYC will have optimum national and global visibility, a virtue to which most any American menswear fashion designer can benefit. 
In New York City, a fashion designer's showcase can more easily

Guests enjoyed complimentary haircuts, trims, and shaves either on their way in, out, or in between shows.  And there were many other surprises on site.  

 Okay, let's talk about what we need the money for and what we're planning to do once we're fully funded. The overall goal is to bring this platform to New York City.  Once we are fully funded, we are going to roll out Men's Fashion Week in the Big Apple early summer 2014.The below spreadsheet is based on a 3-day model using quotes from NYC vendors combined with previous budgets.  Within two or three seasons, we plan to launch a full week of menswear designers.

<p>Venezuela has always stood out for its beautiful beaches, perfect weather, hardworking people and gorgeous women.

<p>Due to social inequality in Venezuela, many women have found difficult the access to new products of all kinds. We are building an eco­friendly marketplace that allows them to shop and sell second­hand indumentary.</p>
<p>The clothes that people don't use are accumulated or thrown away, because in Venezuela doesn't ­exist a recycling/reusing culture nor shopping or selling second­hand articles.</p>
<p>Closettine seeks to be the platform in which venezuelan women can give better use to everything they do not wear in their closets, considering their real value while saving money and generating an income in an unconventional market like the venezuelan market.</p>
<p>We look forward to have a considerable impact on recycling issues in Venezuela. None of our competitors work simultaneously in the economic, social and ecological sector. Our business does not pursue to be the best in the world, but the best for the world.</p>
<p>Venezuela is going trough a severe crisis and it is pretty difficult to obtain venture capital, our goal is to raise 5000$ to boost the process in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the user experience and increase positive comments on the page by 7% by organizing a meet and greet (AUG2017) where shoppers will be able to try Closettinas clothes.</li>
<li>Increase visitor traffic by 10% (SEP2017) through a social media campaign that explains the dynamics of the portal and includes discount promos.</li>
<li>Maintain the operations for the rest of 2017</li>

<p>In Venezuela 70% of people earn less than a dollar per day, our economy is so diminish that any contribution is essential to us, no matter if you think is little, we will use it wisely to make the most of it. <br/> </p>

<h2>Hi everybody,</h2>
<p>As a minimalist I like to carry as little burden as possible, so I designed the IN1 wallet to take with me only the essentials. But sometimes you need more than just credit cards or other cards, we often need to use some cash.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>

<p> </p>
<h2>Carry Crads, Cash, Keys and, more</h2>
<p>The IN1 wallet has a space for cards, but it is also equipped with one spacious pocket that you can use for carrying cash, a receipt or whatever you need.</p>
<p> <img alt=""In1 Wallet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4981/15954287.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""In1 Wallet""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ultra-Slim and Flexible</h2>
<p>Because of its size (8,5 cms x 6,0 cms) and flexibility, the IN1 Wallet is very comfortable and you will not feel it in your pocket. You can even use it with tight clothes and your pocket will not look bulky.</p>
<p> <img alt=""In1 Wallet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/4389/p1020723.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""In1 Wallet""/></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>It can also be used as a key chain due to the removable key-ring.</strong></h3>

<p>   <em>We plan to start shipping our products around late march.</em></p></div>","Hi everybody,
As a minimalist I like to carry as little burden as possible, so I designed the IN1 wallet to take with me only the essentials. But sometimes you need more than just credit cards or other cards, we often need to use some cash.
 

  


 
Carry Crads, Cash, Keys and, more
The IN1 wallet has a space for cards, but it is also equipped with one spacious pocket that you can use for carrying cash, a receipt or whatever you need.
 
 
Ultra-Slim and Flexible
Because of its size (8,5 cms x 6,0 cms) and flexibility, the IN1 Wallet is very comfortable and you will not feel it in your pocket. You can even use it with tight clothes and your pocket will not look bulky.
 
 
 
It can also be used as a key chain due to the removable key-ring.
 
 

 
Safety
You can feel safe using the IN1 Wallet in non-deep-pockets by connecting a strap between the tab and your belt or belt loops on your trousers. You will make it less likely accidental loss, and it will be easier to reach your wallet in deep pockets.
 

 
Carefully selected materials

Made from high quality elastic, this wallet lets you carry as many cards as you need without the risk of losing them, even if it only takes a single card.
 
 

 
Designed for those who want to simplify their lives
Attractive minimalist design, slim, smooth and functional are some of the characteristics that make the IN1 Wallet the ideal accessory for both men and ladies.

<p><strong>Who are WE?</strong></p>
<p>Ekocreashunz is an ecofriendly, handmade jewelry and accessory line that utilizes earth friendly, repurposed and up-cycled ordinary products and turns them into uniquely crafted and custom designed pieces. Birthed from the creative minds of a mother and daughter duo, Lisa and Alexis, Ekocreashunz is based in Atlanta, GA and strives to create items that give a balance to the earth and to each person that owns any of their products.</p>
<p>Each piece has a story, a story woven from the elements that we each look at, feel and touch each day. Gemstones, precious rocks, natural stones, wood and the earth's water resources each serve as inspiration during the creative process.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It is our hope that you will join us in our journey and assist in exposing the creative talents of Ekocreashunz and join our efforts to merge our environment with ecofriendly fashion accessories!  Its fashion with a cause and a true purpose that we all can benefit from.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>So why should YOU support Ekocreashunz?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As a parent, it has always been important to teach my kids the value of independence, hard work, creativity and self preservation.  Ekocreashunz is in large, the brainchild of my young daughter and it is my goal to ensure that I do all that I can to assist in her success.  She has made a full-time commitment to our business and I simply wish to do my part!!!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We know that the there is a lot of hard work and dedication, and it truly takes the support of everyone to make a small business successful.  We are willing to do the work and remain true to our company goals of being ecofriendly.  There is a lot of beauty in the natural elements as well as in those things that we have tossed away because we feel we can no longer use them.  We strive to recreate that beauty in each piece...using what is already there.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Achieving our fund raising goal will allow us to do several major events, each of which will bring more awareness to our mission of creating timeless jewelry while preserving and conserving.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Reasons for you to help!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Recently, we were awarded the Atlanta area RAW Accessories Designer of the Year!  Voted on by the local community, a panel of judges and the overall national audience. Because of our win there, we have been invited to attend the National Event in California.  The exposure and networking that we can gain from our attendance in California will be mind-blowing and has the potential to really put us in a position to expand to a wider audience.  Your contribution will help us prepare for this trip and allow us to attend the award show and compete for business opportunities.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Secondly, our contributions to and participation in our local community events has afforded us the opportunity to display our work in front of global buyers at the annual Atlanta Apparel Trade Show. This top-notch event brings in buyers and sellers from around the world to see the most up and coming designers and gives us the opportunity to have our items purchased and later re-sold in exclusive markets!   We want to give Ekocreashunz the best shot possible and to do this, we need to revamp our exhibit so that it can compete on a national level and stock it with more items than we have ever tasked ourselves to do.  Your help will also allow us to pay our display fees for the trade show, purchase the materials needed and have professionally designed marketing materials created to showcase what we have to offer.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">No gift is too small...and every amount that you contribute is appreciated. We have some amazing sponsorship levels that will score you some of our beautiful jewelry that you can keep or give as a gift to someone else!  We are also happy to speak with you directly about what we do and how we do it, just shoot us over an email.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How you can help?</strong></p>
<p>Help us reach our fund raising goal of $5,000.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Your help will also allow us to pay our display fees for the trade show, purchase the materials needed and have professionally designed marketing materials created to showcase what we have to offer.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Tell a friend, and ask your friend to tell their friends.  We are honored to be able to do what we do, after all, each of us has a role to play in taking care of the environment.  Our goal is to do just that, but allow each of us to “wear” our support through the design of up-cycled, nature inspired pieces.</p>

</div></div>","Who are WE?
Ekocreashunz is an ecofriendly, handmade jewelry and accessory line that utilizes earth friendly, repurposed and up-cycled ordinary products and turns them into uniquely crafted and custom designed pieces. Birthed from the creative minds of a mother and daughter duo, Lisa and Alexis, Ekocreashunz is based in Atlanta, GA and strives to create items that give a balance to the earth and to each person that owns any of their products.
Each piece has a story, a story woven from the elements that we each look at, feel and touch each day. Gemstones, precious rocks, natural stones, wood and the earth's water resources each serve as inspiration during the creative process.
It is our hope that you will join us in our journey and assist in exposing the creative talents of Ekocreashunz and join our efforts to merge our environment with ecofriendly fashion accessories!  Its fashion with a cause and a true purpose that we all can benefit from.
 
So why should YOU support Ekocreashunz?
As a parent, it has always been important to teach my kids the value of independence, hard work, creativity and self preservation.  Ekocreashunz is in large, the brainchild of my young daughter and it is my goal to ensure that I do all that I can to assist in her success.  She has made a full-time commitment to our business and I simply wish to do my part!!!
We know that the there is a lot of hard work and dedication, and it truly takes the support of everyone to make a small business successful.  We are willing to do the work and remain true to our company goals of being ecofriendly.  There is a lot of beauty in the natural elements as well as in those things that we have tossed away because we feel we can no longer use them.  We strive to recreate that beauty in each piece...using what is already there.
Achieving our fund raising goal will allow us to do several major events, each of which will bring more awareness to our mission of creating timeless jewelry while preserving and conserving.
 
Reasons for you to help!
Recently, we were awarded the Atlanta area RAW Accessories Designer of the Year!  Voted on by the local community, a panel of judges and the overall national audience. Because of our win there, we have been invited to attend the National Event in California.  The exposure and networking that we can gain from our attendance in California will be mind-blowing and has the potential to really put us in a position to expand to a wider audience.  Your contribution will help us prepare for this trip and allow us to attend the award show and compete for business opportunities.
Secondly, our contributions to and participation in our local community events has afforded us the opportunity to display our work in front of global buyers at the annual Atlanta Apparel Trade Show. This top-notch event brings in buyers and sellers from around the world to see the most up and coming designers and gives us the opportunity to have our items purchased and later re-sold in exclusive markets!   We want to give Ekocreashunz the best shot possible and to do this, we need to revamp our exhibit so that it can compete on a national level and stock it with more items than we have ever tasked ourselves to do.  Your help will also allow us to pay our display fees for the trade show, purchase the materials needed and have professionally designed marketing materials created to showcase what we have to offer.
No gift is too small...and every amount that you contribute is appreciated. We have some amazing sponsorship levels that will score you some of our beautiful jewelry that you can keep or give as a gift to someone else!  We are also happy to speak with you directly about what we do and how we do it, just shoot us over an email.

 of that area. To do this, our team <i>Gina Fiore</i>, has dedicated a 
limit to open a fashion cafè, the same as this one in another place and 
in another country.<br/>In brief: closely connected to the territory, 
making the best of the local reources. <br/>We have fixed a figure at 65.000 
dollars. This figure is enough to create the same enviroment we have 
created here in Italy. With a similar dressmaker, a similar shop. And a similar small fashion-cafè with closely connected products inside with full respect for the enviroment.<br/>Wherever
 this place shall be, we'd like to create a working team there, with its
 local people, but firstly discover how to furnish the fashion cafè 
recycling old furniture fount in the area and then begin to work with a 
local team, who will start to work together with our team and who will 
then become independent and expand according to the demand.<br/>Still following Gina Fiore's line of fashion.<br/><b>Maybe a way to do export without transport and pollution!</b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/714207/files/20140713081002-Geena_s_Own_-_Team.jpg?1405264202"" src="""" style=""width: 460.872px; height: 307px;""/></p>Gina Fiore: the team!<br/><br/><p></p>

<li>Marketing:  Even established brands need to continuously market themselves and their products.  For a new brand it is absolutely critical.  The remaining 40% will supplement our marketing budget and help us advertise in key consumer periodicals, exhibit at a targeted consumer gear expo, perform multiple direct mailings and beef up of our social media presence.<br/><br/>

Check out our newly revamped Perks!  We've added all the DexShell products at 20% off the retail price.  Great add-ons including 1 year extended discount and pre-launch access to new products.... Look forward to your support!  Thanks!
PER4MANCEGEAR.COM....Hi, and thank you for taking the time to view our Indiegogo funding pitch for  PER4MANCEGEAR.COM.  My name is Christopher Dalton and my partner is Catherine Collins.  Like 99.9999% of the world's population, we want a better life for our kids.  After years of working for others, we decided it was time to take advantage of what the world offers all of us, a chance to develop a business that we're passionate about and build a better life through our own efforts. We ran through a million ideas and business models until one day the light bulb came on and PER4MANCEGEAR.COM was born.  PER4MANCEGEAR.COM is an on-line seller of unique, high performance gear sourced from around the world.  The ""4"" in PER4MANCEGEAR is based on 4 words that best describe what is important to us in our products, business and lives.  The 4 key themes are Passion, Innovation, Creativity and Practicality.  From this base, we began a relentless global search to find products (gear) that fit this mantra.  Gear that someone, somewhere has ""evolutionized,"" taken to the next level and beyond.  Our first find and our core product line is DexShell, a line of waterproof and breathable socks, gloves and hats.  Perfect!  DexShell fits our 4 themes and with our outdoor lifestyle as well.After a year of product testing and business negotiations, PER4MANCEGEAR.COM now markets and sells the DexShell line of waterproof and breathable gear as well as the NikWax family of cleaning, waterproofing and conditioning products for technical gear.  We have a broad range of customers from the professional and recreational outdoor market as well as the professional uniform / gear market.  If you work and/or play outdoors, we want you in our tribe.Our business is up and running and we're gaining momentum daily.  HOWEVER, a major challenge for every business, both large and small is CASH FLOW!  Cash to fund inventory build and expand our marketing is what we need now to move to the next level.  We reinvest every dollar of revenue; don't take a penny from the business and have kept and will continue to keep operating expenses virtually nil.  Our goal is to build a global brand and with your help, we will succeed!Cathy Climbing Mt. Whitney, 2007Christopher after finishing the Transpacific Yacht Race (Transpac), 1999By The Numbers....We're looking for a minimum of US$10,000.00 which will be utilized as follows:
Inventory Build:  The ability to offer quick delivery from inventory is paramount to success for a business like PER4MANCEGEAR.COM.  Therefore it is critical to have sufficient on-hand inventory to be able to react to consumer demand.  A tricky challenge when first starting out.  40% of the funding raised will go into new inventory purchase.

Marketing:  Even established brands need to continuously market themselves and their products.  For a new brand it is absolutely critical.  The remaining 40% will supplement our marketing budget and help us advertise in key consumer periodicals, exhibit at a targeted consumer gear expo, perform multiple direct mailings and beef up of our social media presence.

New Product Search:  We have quite a few new products on the back burner.  We require funding to have samples produced for product and market testing purposes.  The remaining 20% of the funds raised will go towards new product development, sourcing and testing.
All contributions will be greatly appreciated and will be employed wisely.   This is our promise to you! Join Our Tribe....Beyond the support that crowd funding brings, we need brand ambassadors... those who see and understand our vision as well as use and love our gear.  We want each and every one of you to become a PER4MANCEGEAR.COM brand ambassador.  We've developed some exciting opportunities for you to support us and receive PER4MANCEGEAR  in return!  Not a marathoner, ultimate kayaker, offshore sailor?  Don't need to be... if your life finds you outdoors, you're bound to get wet!  I even wear DexShell socks with business suits!  A Sampling of PER4MANCEGEAR.COMDexShell Waterproof & Breathable Socks...A variety of differing types depending on applications and desired performance.....DexShell Waterproof & Breathable Gloves...Warm and cold weather recreational as well as cut resistant Personal Protection Equipment waterproof & breathable glovesTouchFit Warm Weather Gloves....                  ThermFit Cold Weather Gloves...TechShield Cut, Abrasion & Tear Resistant Waterproof & Breathable Gloves (Left)ToughShield Cut & Flame Resistant Waterproof & Breathable Gloves (Right)DexShell Waterproof & Breathable Hats...See all of our products at http://www.per4mancegear.comBuilding this brand is our passion, focus and long term goal.  Success to us is measured in both dollars as well as in the sense of satisfaction we feel when our customers write to thank us for providing  high quality products and for going the extra distance to make sure they're fully satisfied.  We look forward to the challenge of scaling up while maintaining our vision.  Your support will go a very long way in helping us along this path.  How DexShell Works...DexShell employs a highly unique method for providing waterproof & breathable functionality to its socks, gloves and hats.  As with many ""tech"" innovations, it's the synergistic combination of materials and design that gives the products their unique performance.

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>For the last year, we’ve been working with <b>world-leading manufacturers and jewellery specialists</b> to develop affordable, classic luxury watches that don’t compromise in design, comfort or quality.</p>
<p>When designing this line, we made sure of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stunning, classic design that could be worn by both men and women, in either a professional or casual setting </li>
<li>The highest quality European materials, that are both a comfortable fit and incredibly durable </li>
<li>To be able to offer our watches at a fraction of the price of our competitors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Our manufacturing partners are leading companies in their space, who have been creating timepieces for luxury watch brands, often retailing at over $1,000 and lasting decades — for generations.</p>
<p><b>Soft Italian Vegetable-Grade Leather</b></p>
<p>We’ve incorporated true European luxury into our watches by sourcing soft Italian leather from the finest local artesian tanneries in Southern Italy.</p>

We're an emerging Australian watch company, creating high-quality watches without inflated prices.
With soft Italian Leather straps, we have combined the highest-quality components into our watches. 

The Amalfi, 38mm, on an average sized wrist.
 

The Cannes, 38mm, on an average sized wrist.

The Florence, 38mm, on an average sized wrist
 

The Zurich, 38mm, on an average sized wrist.

Design
For the last year, we’ve been working with world-leading manufacturers and jewellery specialists to develop affordable, classic luxury watches that don’t compromise in design, comfort or quality.
When designing this line, we made sure of three things:

A stunning, classic design that could be worn by both men and women, in either a professional or casual setting 
The highest quality European materials, that are both a comfortable fit and incredibly durable 
To be able to offer our watches at a fraction of the price of our competitors



 
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing partners are leading companies in their space, who have been creating timepieces for luxury watch brands, often retailing at over $1,000 and lasting decades — for generations.
Soft Italian Vegetable-Grade Leather
We’ve incorporated true European luxury into our watches by sourcing soft Italian leather from the finest local artesian tanneries in Southern Italy.

<h1>Who's Guizzi </h1>
<p>Two years
ago chattering with a friend of mine we realized that today you can personalize
whatever you want....such as houses, offices, decor, laptop, mobile and much
more. Personally I often created dresses I designed thanks to a dressmaker such
as jewelry or shoes....but it never happened with bags!</p>
<p>I met a lot
of artcrafts very able in making good bags but they never understand what's on
your mind.... Even high quality industrial products are not satisfactories.
That's why we decided to put together a professional dealer, a creative mind,
some artcrafts and create.... <b>GUIZZI</b>. The dream comes true....why can't we do
the same for all women? </p>
<p>Thanks to
technology we can.....but we need to engage an Italian manager and put on web
our project that everyone could share. Downloading a mobile app it could be
possible to shape a Guizzi Bag.....each single idea shared on <b>Guizzi Bags App</b>
could turn into a unique product.</p>
<p> Let's imagine your own bag...<b>GUIZZI</b> team will
make it real and completely unique in the world.</p>
<p>Our
products are all made in eco-leather cause we love animals.</p>
<p>Our
products are all made by hand cause we believe that technology can never make
it better than man.</p>
<p>Our
products are all made in Italy cause it's the best quality in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Chi è Guizzi?</h1>
<p>Un paio di anni fa parlando con un’amica abbiamo convenuto
che ormai le personalizzazioni sono fattibili in quasi tutti i settori…..personalizziamo
case, uffici, arredamento, laptop, mobile e tanto altro, personalmente devo
dire che sono spesso ricorsa a sartorie per farmi realizzare capi di
abbigliamento che esistevano solo nella mia mente, ad orafi per farmi
personalizzare dei gioielli, addirittura scarpe…… ma non sono mai riuscita a
personalizzarmi una <b>borsa</b>.</p>
<p>Nella mia ricerca ho anche trovato artigiani bravi, ma
spesso si limitano a realizzarti il prodotto che sanno fare, senza recepire le
tue necessità creative…. E i prodotti industriali anche se di buon livello non
mi colpiscono facilmente. Ecco che dall’incontro di una cliente esigente e
commerciale di professione, una creativa capace di trasformare un sogno in un
disegno realizzabile, un team di produzione artigianale capace di recepire le
indicazioni del designer e di rendere concreti i progetti mettendo al primo
posto la cura dei particolari degni di una Griffe di Alta moda……nasce <b>GUIZZI</b>.</p>
<p>Il sogno è diventato realtà…… e perché non dare a tutte le
donne del mondo la stessa possibilità??</p>
<p>Oggi grazie alla tecnologia si può…..ed ecco che il nostro
team aspira a crescere e  arricchirsi di
un IT manager che metta sul web il nostro progetto rendendolo fruibile a tutti,
scaricando sul cellulare una semplice <b><i>APP </i></b> grazie alla quale ogni borsa Guizzi sarà unica
nel suo genere, e ogni idea inviata tramite la <b>Guizzi Bags App</b> darà luogo ad un
prodotto unico, frutto del lavoro manuale e della creatività umana.</p>
<p>La lungimiranza di un commerciale del settore unita con la
creatività della designer hanno dato luogo ad un prodotto nuovo, realizzabile
in tempi brevi, e senza eguali nel suo settore.</p>
<p>Immagina anche tu la tua borsa, il team di <b>GUIZZI</b> la renderà reale ed avrai un
oggetto unico al mondo.</p>
<p>I nostri prodotti sono realizzati tutti in <b><i>ecopelle</i></b>,
perché amiamo gli animali </p>
<p>I nostri prodotti sono tutti <b><i>fatti a mano</i></b>, perché la
tecnologia è a supporto dell’uomo ma non potrà mai sostituirlo</p>
<p>I nostri prodotti sono realizzati interamente in <b><i>Italia</i></b>,
perché il mondo ci riconosce la qualità del prodotto <b><i>interamente Italiano</i></b>.</p>

Guizzi bags
realizes handmade bags exclusively made in Italy with a unique design, by using
just fine ecological leather. Now Guizzi Brand wants to get a value added as
gift for its clients...an app Android/Apple for your shopping on line which
allows to customize your own bag from your phone during a walk (just as for our
model in the video) or whenever you need, by choosing colours and type. No more
problems for arrangement the right bag with your outfit but most important your
bag will be unique. We could even satisfy demanding request as exclusive.

Guizzi Bags realizza borse artigianali, totalmente made in
italy, con un design esclusivo, e di finissima ecopelle per salvaguardare la
vita animale. Oggi la griffe Guizzi vuole realizzare un valore aggiunto da donare
alla propria clientela: un’applicazione
 Android/Apple che permetta non
solo di acquistare online ma anche di personalizzare dal proprio cellulare,
all’occorrenza anche durante una passeggiata per lo shopping come è successo
alla nostra modella,  la borsa dei colori
che si necessita. Non avrai più il problema di trovare la borsa giusta per il
tuo outfit e inoltre… ogni esemplare di borsa può diventare unico. Valutiamo
anche la possibilità dell’esclusiva per clienti particolarmente esigenti.


BACKSTAGE   


Who's Guizzi 
Two years
ago chattering with a friend of mine we realized that today you can personalize
whatever you want....such as houses, offices, decor, laptop, mobile and much
more. Personally I often created dresses I designed thanks to a dressmaker such
as jewelry or shoes....but it never happened with bags!
I met a lot
of artcrafts very able in making good bags but they never understand what's on
your mind.... Even high quality industrial products are not satisfactories.
That's why we decided to put together a professional dealer, a creative mind,
some artcrafts and create.... GUIZZI. The dream comes true....why can't we do
the same for all women? 
Thanks to
technology we can.....but we need to engage an Italian manager and put on web
our project that everyone could share. Downloading a mobile app it could be
possible to shape a Guizzi Bag.....each single idea shared on Guizzi Bags App
could turn into a unique product.
 Let's imagine your own bag...GUIZZI team will
make it real and completely unique in the world.
Our
products are all made in eco-leather cause we love animals.
Our
products are all made by hand cause we believe that technology can never make
it better than man.
Our
products are all made in Italy cause it's the best quality in the world.


Chi è Guizzi?
Un paio di anni fa parlando con un’amica abbiamo convenuto
che ormai le personalizzazioni sono fattibili in quasi tutti i settori…..personalizziamo
case, uffici, arredamento, laptop, mobile e tanto altro, personalmente devo
dire che sono spesso ricorsa a sartorie per farmi realizzare capi di
abbigliamento che esistevano solo nella mia mente, ad orafi per farmi
personalizzare dei gioielli, addirittura scarpe…… ma non sono mai riuscita a
personalizzarmi una borsa.
Nella mia ricerca ho anche trovato artigiani bravi, ma
spesso si limitano a realizzarti il prodotto che sanno fare, senza recepire le
tue necessità creative…. E i prodotti industriali anche se di buon livello non
mi colpiscono facilmente. Ecco che dall’incontro di una cliente esigente e
commerciale di professione, una creativa capace di trasformare un sogno in un
disegno realizzabile, un team di produzione artigianale capace di recepire le
indicazioni del designer e di rendere concreti i progetti mettendo al primo
posto la cura dei particolari degni di una Griffe di Alta moda……nasce GUIZZI.
Il sogno è diventato realtà…… e perché non dare a tutte le
donne del mondo la stessa possibilità??
Oggi grazie alla tecnologia si può…..ed ecco che il nostro
team aspira a crescere e  arricchirsi di
un IT manager che metta sul web il nostro progetto rendendolo fruibile a tutti,
scaricando sul cellulare una semplice APP  grazie alla quale ogni borsa Guizzi sarà unica
nel suo genere, e ogni idea inviata tramite la Guizzi Bags App darà luogo ad un
prodotto unico, frutto del lavoro manuale e della creatività umana.
La lungimiranza di un commerciale del settore unita con la
creatività della designer hanno dato luogo ad un prodotto nuovo, realizzabile
in tempi brevi, e senza eguali nel suo settore.
Immagina anche tu la tua borsa, il team di GUIZZI la renderà reale ed avrai un
oggetto unico al mondo.
I nostri prodotti sono realizzati tutti in ecopelle,
perché amiamo gli animali 
I nostri prodotti sono tutti fatti a mano, perché la
tecnologia è a supporto dell’uomo ma non potrà mai sostituirlo
I nostri prodotti sono realizzati interamente in Italia,
perché il mondo ci riconosce la qualità del prodotto interamente Italiano.

<em><strong><br/></strong></em><strong>UPDATE</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>Thanks so much for all of your support, and for believing in the next evolution in makeup!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Together we've raised over $4,000 so far, WOW! That is amazing!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>With these funds I can pay our brilliant videographer, get the jars professionally heat-stamped w/ the gorgeous lid designs you've all been voting on (thank you!) so they'll look amazing on the glossy pages of big beauty mags!

<p><strong>I still need your help, now more than ever, to spread awareness of this campaign and that it's time for makeup to change--no more heavy unnecessarily unhealthy, dry, suffocating makeup.

<p><strong>Let's make makeup better looking and better for you!<br/></strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>intuitive COLOR</strong>, a natural, nourishing makeup set that is free of micas, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and other unhealthy minerals is the next evolution in makeup – handmade in the USA.</em></p>

<h3><strong>My Story</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that even natural and mineral makeups are not yet safe enough. And that’s why I developed <strong>intuitive COLOR</strong> – a lightweight, blendable, breathable, nourishing type of makeup made with only natural and cosmetic grade mineral ingredients. Made in the USA with lots of love and care, <strong>intuitive COLOR</strong> proves that we can have better makeup with safer ingredients.</p>
<p>The three-part foundation set, our trifecta of smooth, color and set, is formulated with nourishing, line-erasing mango butter, beta-carotene and omega 7 rich sea buckthorn oil, and protein and calcium rich USA pearl powder.</p>
<p>I developed these products for women like me – dreamers, health nuts, natural beauty devotees, makeup junkies and all who are concerned with what they put on their skin that is absorbed into our bodies. I am inspired by the challenge of not settling for what’s safer, but safest.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Contribution</strong></h3>
<p>With the help of Indiegogo and people like you, we can spread the word that safer, healthier makeup is finally here. Being taken seriously as a cosmetic brand requires the attention of big beauty media outlets like Vogue, InStyle, Allure, Glamour and WWD, otherwise it will take years to educate people about better, safer makeup options. In order to do this, I need the help of a PR expert like Melissa Cassera who can help me to effectively spread the word and get <strong>intuitive COLOR</strong> noticed.</p>
<h3><strong><img alt=""intuitive COLOR perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intuitivecolor.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/perks-igg.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve put a lot of love into the rewards we’ve come up with for our supporters, and we hope you’ll give us the opportunity to return the generosity to you. We can’t do this without you, so if you believe in our mission, please help by sharing and spreading the word.</p>
<p>After your pledge, we will mail you some tiny samples for selecting just the right shade. Please reply to us by emailing orders [at] intuitivecolor.co with your preferred shade and the perks will begin mailing at the end of January 2013.</p>
<p>For USA pledges, shipping is free, for Canada please add $10 to your pledge, for other countries please add $30.</p>
<h3>Why I Develop Makeup and Skin Care Products</h3>
<p>I am a seeker by nature, always searching for the safest, healthiest, best option in a given category. And when it comes to the products that we put on our skin every day, I believe it is very important to get it right.</p>
<p>Developing skin care products for my line <a href=""http://glutenfreebeauty.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gluten Free Beauty</a> since 2010 has forced me to really think about our skin’s needs. In an ideal world, perhaps we wouldn’t need to wear any makeup, but there is a certain thrill to balancing out one’s complexion, enhancing one’s true beauty, and facing the world with our best face forward. But I refuse to settle for what looks good, but is bad for me.</p>
<p><img alt=""history of makeup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intuitivecolor.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/history-of-makeup-igg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mineral makeup revolutionized the beauty industry in the late 1990s. It was the first time a real performance type of makeup that wasn’t laden with parabens, fragrance and petro chems became available to the mass market. And the message was brilliantly spread throughout the world with the help of QVC.</p>
<p>Now it’s time for a high performance, natural and mineral makeup that leaves out those minerals which have been proven to be unhealthy.</p>
<p>EWG’s SkinDeep Database links titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to cancer and respiratory toxicity. And micas, which create all those beautiful pigmented colors contain titanium dioxide. But you cannot find natural or mineral makeups that are free from these ingredients.</p>
<h3><em><img alt=""Kristen Campbell Brown"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.intuitivecolor.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kristen-campbell-igg.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 4px;""/>We don’t need these unhealthy ingredients.</em></h3>
<p>Natural, mineral makeup doesn’t need these ingredients. There are alternatives. That’s why I developed <strong>intuitive COLOR</strong> with just a few natural and mineral essentials. But in order to want to use a product every day, it can’t just be safer, it must also look and feel amazing, lightweight and breathable.</p>
<p>It must be so blendable that you can dab it on as a concealer (cutting out one other product you would otherwise need), and so lightweight that you can simply dust it on, or layer it on for special events, and so nourishing that it actually hydrates the skin and helps reduce lines and wrinkles.</p>
<p>All of these components are possible, so why would we use any other type of product?</p>
<p>It’s time to say goodbye to dry, cakey, heavy, unhealthy makeup.</p>

<h3><strong>Key Benefits</strong></h3>

Mango Butter is also said to have protective effects against UV radiation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pearl Powder </strong>An ancient Asian secret for health and skin care, Pearl Powder is rich in antioxidants, calcium and essential  trace minerals. It is renowned for its ability to reduce wrinkles, fight aging, reduce sunspots, calm inflammation, clear acne and promote younger looking skin.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sea Buckthorn Oil </strong>Said to be the single highest source of vitamin C, vitamin E, unsaturated fatty acids, essential amino acids, and beta-carotene, Sea Buckthorn Oil is renowned for its ability to combat wrinkles, dryness, and the signs of aging.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Our goal is to help put students through school while decking them out in affordable and stylish eyewear. Help us fill out our product line of sunglasses for summer 2012 by pledging today!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Blenders Scholarship Program: Why does it matter?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2""><em>""If we’re going to have a world class education system, young people have to be able to afford to go to college and pursue postgraduate work if they’re so inclined. Not only will the country as a whole benefit, but we will be true to what has always been the essential idea and ethic of American life, which is upward mobility and opportunity; That every child can achieve their goals. We want to make sure that every child has a chance to excel and find those areas in their lives that will allow them to make the most contribution to society. We’re failing to do that now.""</em></span><span class=""s2""><em>-</em><strong><em>President Barack Obama</em></strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Through our Blenders Scholarship Program, we help put college students through school while highlighting and fueling the efforts of America's best and brightest young people. We'll start small, buying books and whatever we can, and grow from there alongside the students we support. Eventually, we aim to award substantial scholarships to students all over the country. By selecting candidates who are actively pursuing goals like starting their own businesses, traveling the world, and community growth projects, we hope to both bolster them in their efforts and inspire their classmates.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Why sunglasses?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We were tired of having to choose between expensive designer sunglasses that inevitably disappear or break, or janky beach knockoffs that can lead to conspicuous style deficiency. Blenders shades are high quality, polarized, impact resistant sunglasses, designed with passion and priced at a point that almost begs you to lose em' or break em'...for the simple pleasure of picking out that next color combo.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Why Pledge?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your contribution to our indiegogo project will help fund our full specturm of color for summer 2012, 5 new colors, which in turn allows us to continue with our mission of helping fund scholarships for students and giving back to education!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What's the bottom line?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Every pledge goes to new shades. Every pair of shades helps students get through school. JLT (Just Like That). </span></p>

Our goal is to help put students through school while decking them out in affordable and stylish eyewear. Help us fill out our product line of sunglasses for summer 2012 by pledging today!
Blenders Scholarship Program: Why does it matter?
""If we’re going to have a world class education system, young people have to be able to afford to go to college and pursue postgraduate work if they’re so inclined. Not only will the country as a whole benefit, but we will be true to what has always been the essential idea and ethic of American life, which is upward mobility and opportunity; That every child can achieve their goals. We want to make sure that every child has a chance to excel and find those areas in their lives that will allow them to make the most contribution to society. We’re failing to do that now.""-President Barack Obama
Through our Blenders Scholarship Program, we help put college students through school while highlighting and fueling the efforts of America's best and brightest young people. We'll start small, buying books and whatever we can, and grow from there alongside the students we support. Eventually, we aim to award substantial scholarships to students all over the country. By selecting candidates who are actively pursuing goals like starting their own businesses, traveling the world, and community growth projects, we hope to both bolster them in their efforts and inspire their classmates.
Why sunglasses?
We were tired of having to choose between expensive designer sunglasses that inevitably disappear or break, or janky beach knockoffs that can lead to conspicuous style deficiency. Blenders shades are high quality, polarized, impact resistant sunglasses, designed with passion and priced at a point that almost begs you to lose em' or break em'...for the simple pleasure of picking out that next color combo.
Why Pledge?
Your contribution to our indiegogo project will help fund our full specturm of color for summer 2012, 5 new colors, which in turn allows us to continue with our mission of helping fund scholarships for students and giving back to education!
What's the bottom line?
Every pledge goes to new shades. Every pair of shades helps students get through school. JLT (Just Like That). 
We can't wait to get you in a pair of Blenders! Thank you for your support and please contact us for questions, comments, or a surf report. The Future is Bright. Come Prepared.

FAQ
1) When can I expect to see my perk packages?
We will ship out all perk packages in June, just in time to rock your 'Blenders for summer! 
2) What colors will I be able to chose from If I have pledged? 
Once the funding campaign ends (May 10th) we'll contact you and ask you which colors/ or styles you'd like. 
3) Do you ship internationally?
Yes, we do ship internationally! We will ship your 'Blenders to the moon if we have to :)

<h3>The Story of a spark<br/>
</h3>
<p>3rd Earth Fireproof is An innovative line of clothing and accessories with fire performers in 
mind. Designed by fire performer and costume designer Tara Mc Manus, she has focused her line on the needs of the fire dancer. By blending the latest in materials such as stretch Kevlar® and Nomex ® with natural materials like leather and precious stones, she has engineered the perfect fit for fire dancing. The challenges of starting a clothing line based on military and manufacturing materials are numerous but can be solved with some machine upgrades and new equipment. Once the line is ready to sell, Mc Manus is taking it on tour for a summer of fire festival hopping to reach out to customers, meet fellow fire spinners, learn new fire techniques and grow as a performer and designer. <br/></p>

<p>The 3rd Earth studio needs special blades, leather sewing needles, Kevlar® scissors, grommet dyes and leather working materials to manufacture the designs!

<p>
</p><p><b>How does the hereO GPS watch work?</b></p>
<p>On its own, the watch looks like an everyday child watch and functions as a digital watch. When synched with the hereO Family app, the hereO GPS watch acts as tracker, allowing parents to see their children’s whereabouts. The child wears the watch, and the parents connect with the child by downloading the free hereO family app on their smartphones (iphone or android), or by logging on to your hereO account using any computer. With the hereO family app, parents can set and receive various alerts and notifications such as panic alert, check-in alert, low-battery alert and more.</p>

</p><p><b>What are the features of the hereO GPS watch?</b></p>
<p>The watch is comfortable for any kid to wear everyday and is water resistant. It can be pre-ordered with an optional childproof locking mechanism for an additional fee for parents who are concerned with their child fiddling with the watch. <br/></p><p>The tamper alert works with the hereO watch, both with and without the locking mechanism. When someone unauthorized tries to remove the watch, parents will get an alert on their smartphone. </p>
<p>Parents can set Safe Zones, which are predefined boundaries such as home, school, or playground. When the child enters or leaves a dedicated safe zone, a notification is sent to the parent’s smartphone.</p>
<p>It also features a panic alert that can be easily triggered in any scary situation. On the technical side, the hereO GPS watch comes with a built-in SIM-Card. The SIM-Card connects directly to a wireless network automatically and works in over 120 countries. There are no contracts to sign. No tie-up to service providers. No changing of SIM cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Will the hereO watch fit my child?</b></p>
<p>The watch has a flexible and fully adjustable wristband, which will fit most children from three years and up. <br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How is the battery life of the hereO GPS watch?</b></p>
<p>The hereO GPS watch is designed to last up to 72 hours between each charge, depending on usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How do I charge the hereO GPS watch?</b></p>
<p>Charging your hereO watch is easy! All you have to do is connect the device to the charging dock, which is included in the box when purchased. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Does the watch feature a battery-alert?</b></p>

From day one we involved kids in the design process, to make sure it was a watch they would really want to wear. We created a range of designs with the aim of developing a standard kids watch. Today, hereO is small, comfortable to wear and trendy. The watch was designed not  to be intrusive to the kid’s daily activities. 

We have partnered with key manufacturers and suppliers from
the rapid prototyping phase to the final production. We work
with a leading contract manufacturer to build the
device. 
				
			
		
We have already manufactured 50 working devices directly from the assembly line.We have nearly reached all our milestones and are ready to bring this product to market. Children’s tiny little wrists, while adorable,
 post a huge technological challenge for any developers to come up with a
 wearable tracking device that is small and comfortable to wear. The hereO 
engineers overcame this challenge by miniaturizing more than 10 components in
 order to make GPS watch that are 100% tailor-made for kids.
The hereO watch assembly process was made simple, enabling us to offer a wide range of watch designs.
While the watch looks like
an everyday child watch, when synched with the HereO Family app, the HereO GPS
watch acts as tracker, allowing parents to keep in constant communication with
their children. 
The hereO ecosystem consists of 3 main components: GPS tracking watch, back-end server, mobile app and web portal.
The image below provides a high-level overview of how the hereO end-to-end system functions.

				
			
		
The watch is bundled with a cellular connection provided by Wyless, 
which works in over 120 countries. This is similar to a standard
cellular connection provided by companies like AT&T or Vodafone, 
except there is no external subscription needed.


hereO was started by three founders (Daniel, Gill and Allon) and now a team of 10 with a 
common mission: to make a product that will keep our children safe within arm's reach. After three years of research & development, we are happy to announce that we have completed our 
first assembly run. A
 group of extraordinary people came together to make this idea a 
reality. From experts in medical miniaturization who redefined the workings of antenna, battery, screen and a few other 
secrets to manufacturers who took control of the entire assembly process
 and prepared us for this moment - to raise funds and to start mass production.The hereO team includes experts with different backgrounds, 
each with their own core competency - from entrepreneurship to hospitality
 to technology and LBS. Additional specialists joined hereO with a range of expertise ranging from hardware engineer, industrial design, branding, marketing, 
app-design, app-programming, software programming and more.

hereO is the first and only complete end-to-end family location sharing service, which include a dedicated device for young children and mobile application for the entire family.



How does the hereO GPS watch work?
On its own, the watch looks like an everyday child watch and functions as a digital watch. When synched with the hereO Family app, the hereO GPS watch acts as tracker, allowing parents to see their children’s whereabouts. The child wears the watch, and the parents connect with the child by downloading the free hereO family app on their smartphones (iphone or android), or by logging on to your hereO account using any computer. With the hereO family app, parents can set and receive various alerts and notifications such as panic alert, check-in alert, low-battery alert and more.

What are the features of the hereO GPS watch?
The watch is comfortable for any kid to wear everyday and is water resistant. It can be pre-ordered with an optional childproof locking mechanism for an additional fee for parents who are concerned with their child fiddling with the watch. The tamper alert works with the hereO watch, both with and without the locking mechanism. When someone unauthorized tries to remove the watch, parents will get an alert on their smartphone. 
Parents can set Safe Zones, which are predefined boundaries such as home, school, or playground. When the child enters or leaves a dedicated safe zone, a notification is sent to the parent’s smartphone.
It also features a panic alert that can be easily triggered in any scary situation. On the technical side, the hereO GPS watch comes with a built-in SIM-Card. The SIM-Card connects directly to a wireless network automatically and works in over 120 countries. There are no contracts to sign. No tie-up to service providers. No changing of SIM cards.

Will the hereO watch fit my child?
The watch has a flexible and fully adjustable wristband, which will fit most children from three years and up. 

How is the battery life of the hereO GPS watch?
The hereO GPS watch is designed to last up to 72 hours between each charge, depending on usage.

How do I charge the hereO GPS watch?
Charging your hereO watch is easy! All you have to do is connect the device to the charging dock, which is included in the box when purchased. 

Does the watch feature a battery-alert?
Yes, when the watch is low on battery, a notification, along with the current location is sent to the parent’s smartphone.

Anecdote aside, that's just one way a high-quality watch can be used, besides telling time. And being a collectible will ensure the Cult Diver stays out of any landfills. The packaging is also kept to a minimum to lessen the use of resources, renewable or not.Sustainable materialsSteel is a uniquely sustainable material because it can be infinitely recycled. Our surgical grade steel is 100% non-allergenic.Sustainable DistributionOur expedition goes by train to the Arctic, where we use dogs and sleds to take us to Troll Lake. We also ensure that our fulfillment centers have carbon footprint offset programs in place.Last but not leastApart from our drive to make a damn good watch with a sense of adventure we are equally passionate about helping to preserve the arctic. The arctic is a delicate ecosystem where things are changing quickly. That’s why we donate 10% of our profits to a selection of environmental organizations.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

That means they only allow 1/50th of those harmful rays through. (Blocking 98% of the other UV rays).

<p>Although natural fibers like Merino Wool and Bamboo are strong, they need a little help from Polyester to make sure your pant stays as good as new even if you wear them 365 days in a year.</p>

<p>This unique property of Bamboo is why we decided to go for Bamboo over Cotton. Bamboo viscose is 3X more absorbent than most cotton fibers, wicking moisture away from the skin much faster and keeping you dry and comfortable easier. Bamboo viscose can take in three times more water than its weight which once made into a fabric, means that it can absorb tons of moisture.</p>

<p>Merino Wool on the outside helps wick away the moisture that the Bamboo has absorbed on the inside. The combined action of Bamboo Viscose and Merino Wool helps keep you dry, fresh, and comfortable.</p>

<p>Think of a sheep. When they get a bit chilly, they don’t head to the closet and grab another layer. When they get warm they don’t throw on a cotton t-shirt. They only get one shot at it and Mother Nature has given them the perfect clothing to keep them comfortable all year round in all kinds of conditions.</p>
<p>Warming: Wool has a natural crimp to it that helps it trap more dead air than any other fiber. Dead air is a fantastic insulator and provides a great buffer against the cold.</p>
<p>Cooling: Wool has the ability to store moisture within the structure of the fiber. As your body warms up, the moisture stored within the fiber will begin to evaporate, cooling the air between your skin and the fabric. The warmer you get the more evaporation takes place and the larger the cooling effect</p>

Travel and the sun go hand in hand and we have got you covered quite literally. BauBax pants are UPF 50+ so you can go out and enjoy the sun! That means they only allow 1/50th of those harmful rays through. (Blocking 98% of the other UV rays). Whats more? all of this comes without any use of harmful chemicals which are found in most sunscreens. So go ahead you sun flower! Beam Away!


Although natural fibers like Merino Wool and Bamboo are strong, they need a little help from Polyester to make sure your pant stays as good as new even if you wear them 365 days in a year.


This unique property of Bamboo is why we decided to go for Bamboo over Cotton. Bamboo viscose is 3X more absorbent than most cotton fibers, wicking moisture away from the skin much faster and keeping you dry and comfortable easier. Bamboo viscose can take in three times more water than its weight which once made into a fabric, means that it can absorb tons of moisture.


Merino Wool on the outside helps wick away the moisture that the Bamboo has absorbed on the inside. The combined action of Bamboo Viscose and Merino Wool helps keep you dry, fresh, and comfortable.


Think of a sheep. When they get a bit chilly, they don’t head to the closet and grab another layer. When they get warm they don’t throw on a cotton t-shirt. They only get one shot at it and Mother Nature has given them the perfect clothing to keep them comfortable all year round in all kinds of conditions.
Warming: Wool has a natural crimp to it that helps it trap more dead air than any other fiber. Dead air is a fantastic insulator and provides a great buffer against the cold.
Cooling: Wool has the ability to store moisture within the structure of the fiber. As your body warms up, the moisture stored within the fiber will begin to evaporate, cooling the air between your skin and the fabric. The warmer you get the more evaporation takes place and the larger the cooling effect


Merino wool is super fine, but yet it can cause an itch, trust us we scratched a lot. So, we smartly put Bamboo closer to your skin and Merino on the outside - to Ditch the Itch. You are welcome!


For those times when you are on the road, we have got good news for you. BauBax pants are naturally quick to dry thanks to the wicking technology. 
















Because all our pants are Teflon treated, they will absorb less odor and stains. Thus, they can and should be washed less frequently.
CARE: Wash with like colors with mild detergent cold. Tumble dry low or lay flat. Do not use fabric softener during wash as this may damage the water repellency. Do NOT bleach. Do NOT dry clean.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It all started out with my experience in the fashion and arts world here and around the Baltimore area. I wanted fashion to be more accessable to the community; to all people, of any shape or size, income, or ethnic background. The first show was a tribute to the late Alexander McQueen, who had such great talents, ideas and presentations that always inspired me. He held fashion shows in all kinds of unsual places, like garages, ice rinks, and warehouses. I thought what better place then the beautiful and historic heart of Baltimore city, Mt Vernon. The parks in historic Mt. Vernon gave us a runway to that topped all runways.  It was length of a large city block including multiple levels, stairs, and a fountain! Wooh, look out Tyra! I stewed over the idea for a while, as I tried to gather my confidence. I decided to post an open invite on facebook to see how many people were interested. It was kind of like getting Betty White on SNL! First there was 10 interested people, then 25, then 90, then over a hundred. I knew I had to make this happen. This would be my biggest challenge ever!! So what exactly was this great idea?!?  ""A Day of Fashion"", is a day in which we invited the community to come out and show their support for the fashion industry. Models strut their stuff, designers show off their talents, photographers professional and amature capture great shots outdoors in the historic park. Also it was to be a chance for people wanting to network and meet others in the fashion &amp; arts field. Finally, an event where other inspiring artist can take part. Offering open runway time gave a chance for the daring to take their first walk. I hoped this event would pass along the inspiration to others in the community to make things happen. ""Free to the Fashionable &amp; Open to the Public"". The event was totally free (and will aways be) to all taking part. Even the Baltimore boutiques I invited to showcase their stores who sell local area fashions. Having a free public event was the biggest challenge! I had to find sponsors who shared in my vision and  to help support my dream and its costs. It happen!! I, We and the Community came together and made the dream a reality when the crowds said it couldn't. My next goal is it to be bigger and better! Now to the up &amp; coming... at the end of the summer, beginning of fall we will hold our 2nd Annual ""A Day of Fashion ~Orchestrated Elegance"". The theme this year will be inspired by Music,. Like fashion: with tedious work and conducting, it creates a beautiful harmony. We are within the second stages of planning and are currently looking for: sponsor to share and fund the vision, designers &amp; boutiques to show their clothing, models, photographers, hair and make-up artists in order to make this a sucess. If that is not enough I am still in need of a strong support staff. Oh yeah, and music... looking for musicians, from classical - contemporary to accompany our runway shows as they happen. The booming bass we will save for the after-party. This year,  in the park, it will be refined, elegant, with some Bmore charm.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need everyones support! Last year was a great start to our Annual Free Fashion Event for the community.  If we don't get the support we will not be able to make it happen again.  Last year gave alot of people the chance to show their work, take their first walk on the runways and challenge themselves in many ways.  We NEED your help to make this happen again. Bigger and better this year!!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ok, here is the scoop. It costs us $2000 dollar to rent the parks in Mt Vernon. Last year, there is no discount or difference for non-profit events.  I personally rasied and funded all costs myself last year and got together everything together in a matter of 3 months.  This year was an unpleasant suprise to find out the rental fees have doubled to $4000 and even the application fee has gone up to $150 dollars.  So the money we are trying to raise will go to the rental and anything over that will help pay for ads and equipment.  No one taking part in this event is paid.  Everyone is donating their time and energy to make it work because they believe in the dream.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is for the community and supported by the community.  Tell your friends, family, co-workers, that friend you think should be a model and those who need to come out of their shell.  A Day of Fashion is the event to be fashionable, be noticed and be Kantankerous!  <a href=""http://www.adayoffashion.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.adayoffashion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.adayoffashion.com</a>  </p>

<p>Hi there! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">My name is Ana and I am the designer behind Styles By Ana. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">I don't remember the exact moment that I fell in love with neckties, but I've always found them interesting, elegant and just simply fascinating. Nevertheless, they were a man's accessory, therefore untouchable in my head. Until one day, a year and a half ago, when Pinterest showed me a pleated tie. I was delightfully inspired. I bought a tie the next day, hand sewed it and stitched a button on. It brought me so much joy to be creating and sewing again. </span></p>
<p>Styles By Ana MyTies are one of a kind and no two are alike. We love color, floral, geometry, vibrancy, intricacy, paisley patterned neckties in 100% Silk. With those, we pair an amazing array of different colored and sized buttons, pearls and studs, that will provide a feminine touch to the masculine necktie. All items are conceived, sourced, sewn and produced by yours truly in sunny Los Angeles, California. </p>
<p>Concept Fashion Week is a new turn key platform for designers to showcase their collections during fashion week in both New York and Los Angeles and I would very much love to be a part of it in LA. </p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are Üdahaus and we have invented a new product that wants to make you smile!</p>
<p>It's an eyeglass frame attachment that brings a little attitude to your personal style.</p>
<p>We have started with a Boombox, a Disco Ball, and three colored Gummy Bears named Olaf, Günther and DiDi.</p>
<p>The eyeglass frame attachments are easy to use; just take the piece and press it onto your frames. They're unique, fun and perfect for sunglasses, novelty glasses, or prescription glasses.</p>
<p>Along with creating an exciting new accessory, we are out to make a positive impact for our world and those who live in it.</p>
<p>DiDi is our stylish and sassy green Gummy bear, and when you purchase her, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to The Arbor Day Foundation.</p>
<p>Günther is our red jet-setting trendsetter Gummy Bear, and when you purchase him, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>Last but never least is the world's greatest mountain climbing yellow Gummy Bear, Olaf, who loves nature and animals. When you purchase him, a portion of the proceeds will go to the SPCA. </p>
<p>But Üdahaus is much more than eye style frame attachments. We are developing an exciting online social media website where you can create your own artwork, chat with others, receive discounts on Üdahaus merchandise such as clothing, hats, and stickers, and learn more about the charities you are helping. </p>
<p>So where is Üdahaus today?</p>
<p>We have filed our trademarks, copyrights and patent paperwork.  We have negotiated terms with a factory to produce our items and have begun developing our first generation website.</p>
<p>We now need your support to make it all happen!  Your generous pledges will enable us to order the frame attachments, purchase an inventory of Üdahaus merchandise, maximize the potential of our inter-active website and to start making a significant difference to our charities. </p>

Born and raised on Vashon Island, among a thriving community of artists and creators, I knew from an early age that I too wanted to join the creative world. I started shooting photography at 11 years old and two years ago, I realized my dream of bringing these passions together in the form of an apparel line: Create Joy &amp; Beauty. Inspired by what is captured through the lens of my camera, CJB designs are fresh, unique, and an authentic expression of youth. </p>

<p><strong>WHAT</strong>: My goal is to fund a national tour for CJB Apparel this summer. I plan to vend at popular music festivals all over the country. I am an avid festival-goer and a huge fan of EDM (Electronic Dance Music), and relish these opportunities to connect with fellow music-lovers and entrepeneurs. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: Photography has been a part of my life since I was 11, but I hope to make 2013 the year I take my designs and concepts to the next level. The tour will last from June-September 2013. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE</strong>: I will be vending at several of the popular music festivals around the country. Starting with vending at Paradiso at the Gorge, Washington.</p>

<p><strong>WHY CJB? </strong>CJB Apparel has been independently run for two years now. All CJB design work, and the marketing of those designs, has been run by me myself and I (with help from some friends of course!). I would hope that this shows the true dedication and passion that goes into this brand.</p>

<p>I work really hard to keep designs fresh, colorful and authentic. For example, although tempting, I try to steer clear from the typical Seattle designs involving the Space Needle. The Space Needle never really represented Seattle for me. The cranes next to the West Seattle Bridge, however, were what I drove by every single time I traveled to Seattle, and THOSE are what I remember most: the dinosaurs of Seattle! I leave the Space Needle designs to other local brands who have already honed in on that design so successfully. </p>
<p><strong><em><strong>What CJB Needs &amp; What You Get:</strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Vending</strong>: I have already paid for 4 events, totaling $2,080. I still need to pay for the rest of the events, as well as pay for the inventory itself! </p>
<p><strong>Transportation: </strong>I have calculated roughly $2,000 total in gas costs. </p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> I will be making most of my inventory ahead of time. I have put in hours of design time, coming up with new and exclusive summer designs and need funds to keep inventory coming while on the road. However, what is so cool about everything I produce this summer, is that once it's sold out, it's SOLD OUT! </p>

<p><strong>Where do the funds go if I don't reach my goal?</strong></p>
<p>If my goal is not reached, the funds I raise will go to vending fees for each festival, and inventory costs. This way, I can hopefully recycle the money I make at festivals to get me from one festival to the next.<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>As a designer, I think one of the biggest fears I have is not running out of ideas, but running out of product! </p>
<p>Another challenge I expect to face is consistency with product, promotion, and social media. I’ll be on the road 24/7, which means when I’m not driving, I’ll need to be spreading the word on the CJB brand, and keeping up with my inventory. I plan to tackle this in the best way I know how: lots of rest, and with the help of friends (and a little planning and organization too)! I hope to bring one or two people along with me to help balance it all.</p>
<p>This trip will be the experience of a lifetime, but it’s going to require a lot of hard work and dedication for it to become a reality. With the help of backers, a reliable screen printing company, a few helpful friends, and a collective of supporters (YOU!!!), these challenges will be overcome! Thank you Indiegogo, and I'll see you on the road!</p>

   EXTENDED VIDEO: By Melissa Seda Films 
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtE8Imf9ZuM&feature=youtu.be                                             
WHO: My name is Cassie Joy Bergman - I am currently a full-time student in my senior year at Washington State University. Born and raised on Vashon Island, among a thriving community of artists and creators, I knew from an early age that I too wanted to join the creative world. I started shooting photography at 11 years old and two years ago, I realized my dream of bringing these passions together in the form of an apparel line: Create Joy & Beauty. Inspired by what is captured through the lens of my camera, CJB designs are fresh, unique, and an authentic expression of youth. 

WHAT: My goal is to fund a national tour for CJB Apparel this summer. I plan to vend at popular music festivals all over the country. I am an avid festival-goer and a huge fan of EDM (Electronic Dance Music), and relish these opportunities to connect with fellow music-lovers and entrepeneurs. 
 
WHEN: Photography has been a part of my life since I was 11, but I hope to make 2013 the year I take my designs and concepts to the next level. The tour will last from June-September 2013. 
 
WHERE: I will be vending at several of the popular music festivals around the country. Starting with vending at Paradiso at the Gorge, Washington.
  

WHY CJB? CJB Apparel has been independently run for two years now. All CJB design work, and the marketing of those designs, has been run by me myself and I (with help from some friends of course!). I would hope that this shows the true dedication and passion that goes into this brand.
 
I work really hard to keep designs fresh, colorful and authentic. For example, although tempting, I try to steer clear from the typical Seattle designs involving the Space Needle. The Space Needle never really represented Seattle for me. The cranes next to the West Seattle Bridge, however, were what I drove by every single time I traveled to Seattle, and THOSE are what I remember most: the dinosaurs of Seattle! I leave the Space Needle designs to other local brands who have already honed in on that design so successfully. 
What CJB Needs & What You Get:
Vending: I have already paid for 4 events, totaling $2,080. I still need to pay for the rest of the events, as well as pay for the inventory itself! 
Transportation: I have calculated roughly $2,000 total in gas costs. 
Inventory: I will be making most of my inventory ahead of time. I have put in hours of design time, coming up with new and exclusive summer designs and need funds to keep inventory coming while on the road. However, what is so cool about everything I produce this summer, is that once it's sold out, it's SOLD OUT! 
  
Food: I will be living on the road 90% of the time, and will be eating out of pocket on the daily. It would be great to raise a little extra so I can be sure to have grub funds! 
Van: This is the van I hope to take on the road with me if I raise enough! She's a beauty! 
  
What You Get: Fresh, unique, lovingly crafted art creations turned into quality designer apparel. My everlasting gratitude!! A chance to help me Create Joy & Beauty across the country! Follow my road trip and stay updated on my whereabouts, the music scene & all kinds of hip happenings. 

 
YOU GET TO BE PART OF SOMETHING WONDERFUL!!!
 
Where do the funds go if I don't reach my goal?
If my goal is not reached, the funds I raise will go to vending fees for each festival, and inventory costs. This way, I can hopefully recycle the money I make at festivals to get me from one festival to the next. 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
As a designer, I think one of the biggest fears I have is not running out of ideas, but running out of product! 
Another challenge I expect to face is consistency with product, promotion, and social media. I’ll be on the road 24/7, which means when I’m not driving, I’ll need to be spreading the word on the CJB brand, and keeping up with my inventory. I plan to tackle this in the best way I know how: lots of rest, and with the help of friends (and a little planning and organization too)! I hope to bring one or two people along with me to help balance it all.
This trip will be the experience of a lifetime, but it’s going to require a lot of hard work and dedication for it to become a reality. With the help of backers, a reliable screen printing company, a few helpful friends, and a collective of supporters (YOU!!!), these challenges will be overcome! Thank you Indiegogo, and I'll see you on the road!
Other Ways You Can Help
I completely understand that some folks just can't afford to donate. HAVE NO FEAR! YOU CAN STILL HELP, MY DEAR!
We live in a social media world. It is SO easy to get the word out to your friends and family by simply posting a link to my Indiegogo profile. Make some noise about the CJB Apparel campaign! Post this link on your Facebook, Twitter or personal blog, or email it to friends and family! You never know WHO will see it and take advantage of some great deals!

Snow Ghost and iSki - Designs Inspired by the Mountain Slopes!

   
         
           
       

 
Snow Ghost is my favorite chair lift on Schweitzer Mountain in Idaho! I learned to ski here in 2011 and spent quite some time shreddin' the Snow Ghost slopes. Look for chair lift #101 when you're wearing your Snow Ghost shirt!
 
The iSki design is an image of my shadow on the first chair lift on Schweitzer Mountain. I love this design because it reminds me of the first lift of the day. After driving three hours from Pullman, it's always refreshing to hop on that first lift before a full day of riding the slopes!

EDM Tank - I've always had a huge passion for Electronic Dance Music. I've been going to shows since I was 17. EDM will always have a special place in my heart. The lettering for this tank is produced from a photograph I took at Identity Festival at the Gorge, Washington in 2011.

Frame the Fame Perk: Whoville



While traveling in Europe in May 2012, I found myself taking lots of mental notes of fashion trends. I brought home a wonderful dress from Germany that became the basis for the design of these skirts. My mom, Eileen, and I made these patterns by hand and hand-sewed them as well! Also among my hand-made items are these sequined bras I created.
 



 
     Another Winter Favorite, the CJBeanie!

 
 
 
 



 
Below you'll see the new My Paradiso design. Remember! This design will come on lightweight tees and tanks of all colors for both men and women. Fringe tanks will be offered as well!

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>The inspiration for Knix Wear came while looking into a more suitable underwear solution for the 1 in 3 women who experience the occasional light leak also known as stress incontinence. In the process of developing our technology, we discovered that it could be slim enough to fit into any style of underwear. And that the benefits it offered would be appreciated by more than just 1 in 3, but 100% of women. </p>

<p>We are targeting a July delivery for all finished goods. We are confident that we will meet this timeline as we have been working with our manufacturing partners for a few months and have finalized our patterns and designs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When do I get to pick my size and colour? </strong></p>
<p>We will send you a link once the campaign has been completed where you can pick your desired size and colour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the product eliminate odor?</strong></p>
<p>Fresh Fix TechnologyTM features silver threading which naturally kills odor-causing bacteria. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much can the product absorb?</strong></p>
<p>Every pair of Knix Wear knickers can absorb up to 3 teaspoons of liquid at any one time. The bikini and boyshort styles have a larger gusset and therefore are able to absorb even more than the thong style.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What kind of research have you done?</strong></p>
<p>When coming up with the product requirements we did a mix of primary and secondary research.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where can I learn more about stress incontinence? </strong></p>
<p>A great place to start is the resources provided by the National Association for Continence in the US. <a href=""http://www.nafc.org/bladder-bowel-health/what-is-incontinence/what-every-woman-should-know/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nafc.org/bladder-bowel-health/what-is-incontinence/what-every-woman-should-know/</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will Knix Wear fit me if I'm pregnant?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, all of our underwear is designed to sit below the belly for a comfortable fit no matter how far along you are. But for maximum comfort, we recommend the Knix line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you plan on making additional colours and styles available?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We have plans in the works for additional colors, sizes and styles. But we'd love your feedback, so if you have anything in particular that you would love to see, just let us know. </p>

<h1><strong>Fuse-panel-pho-bi-a</strong></h1>
<p><strong>(<em>the fear of changing a fuse)</em></strong></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Joel Vogt, and I am one of the 40+ million people in North America who still have to deal with an old fuse panel at work or home. If you have one too, then you know what a harrowing experience changing a fuse in that old panel can be. The first thing that comes to mind when you ""blow"" a fuse and approach the fuse panel is, ""electricity can kill me."" So, naturally, we've all tried different methods to be on the safe side when changing a fuse; from wearing rubber gloves to using a pair of rubber grip pliers, or just using your fingers, which always sends a chill down your back. Others give in to their fears and call an electrician. Well, after a close call with my fuse panel and a search in vain for the proper tool to safely change a fuse, <strong><em>I decided to take a stand</em></strong>.</p>
<h1><strong>The Fuse-man safety stick</strong></h1>
<p>I have designed and developed a safety tool that allows me, and you, to safely change a fuse in that old panel. This sleek little device is made from non-conductive material and is long enough to keep your hands away from the  panel. You know how hard it is to identify a blown fuse! I do too, so I built in a flashlight to light up the panel and make a blown fuse very easy to find. Even better, when you remove the fuse with my safety stick you don't have to worry about dropping it on the floor, because a magnet under the rubber grip holds the fuse in place for you. But wait, there's more! After you remove the bad fuse, just pop the top off the Safety Stick and grab a new fuse from the caddy that has room to store five new fuses. And after you've replaced your fuse and the lights are back on, use the magnetic hanger on the Safety Stick to attach it to the panel where it belongs. <strong><em>Mission accomplished!</em></strong></p>
<h1>Typical old fuse panel.</h1>
<p>Here is a photo of an old fuse panel. A lot of panels have been serviced so many times that they are missing the cover plate. How would you like to change a fuse in this one.<em><strong> Shocking thought, huh?!?</strong></em></p>

<h1><strong>The process of development</strong></h1>
<p>I started from an idea and redesigned it several times. With each revision there were new challenges to overcome: creating gripping power that is not too strong or too weak, allowing ease of twisting and pressure, making a perfect connection to hold the fuse securely, and creating a tool that is functional and convenient to use. You would think it would be a simple task for a tool to simply grab and turn a fuse, but that is not the case. Because fuses are made of slick painted metal, it is very difficult to grasp and turn them with your fingers or any other device. Another issue is trying to identify which fuse is blown. Most fuse panels are in areas with poor lighting, so trying to see a burnt filament through the small glass window on a fuse is very frustrating.  To alleviate this problem, I added a built in flashlight. With the inclusion of a storage caddy and magnetic hanger, the result is a completely functioning fuse puller in one sleek tool.<strong><em> Four years later...</em></strong></p>

<h1>I need you to spread the word</h1>
<p>I know fuse panel talk is not a hot topic of conversation for anyone. But if you know someone who has an old fuse panel, let them know about the Fuse-man. With your support we can provide some peace of mind to a fellow fuse puller. Who knows, you may even save someone from harm and at the same time help me move forward with this new innovation. Remember there are 40+ million fuse panels out there that need a Fuse-man attached to them. There is probably someone somewhere right now standing in a dark room with no power and wondering if they should open that fuse panel. <strong><em>Let's empower them.</em></strong></p>

<h1>EVERY ONE NEEDS AN AUNT RUTH...</h1>
<p> Just a little tribute to my <em><strong># 1 Backer...</strong></em> For two years I had been ""designing on a dime"" my Fuse-man project and had once again run out of money. I had my first run of cad drawings complete. I had a quote of $9,000 from a prototyping company to make my first working model. It seemed like a reasonable amount but, as I said, I was broke! I told them to be patient, that I would, somehow, come up with the funds. So I taped my drawings back up to the office wall and resigned myself to more waiting on my dream concept.</p>
<p>A few days later I got a call from my mom telling me something special was in the mail from my recently deceased aunt. Then she added, in almost a whisper, ""not everybody gets one"". A few days after the mysterious phone call, I received a letter from an attorney in Florida notifying me that the Estate of my Aunt Ruth had been settled and I was a beneficiary! Apparently she had made a list of all her nieces and nephews (exactly 47 names).  She then methodically lined through each name that did not ""measure up"" and conversely made a star by each name that did. Being a 6th grade school teacher her whole life, that made perfect sense. (One of my uncles has the actual list.) Each of the twenty finalist were awarded a check for $5,000 dollars. Of course, when I received my letter I immediately called my sister to see if she had made the cut, so to speak, and of course, if she knew who might have been left out. As you can imagine, within days, the whole family was in the know and in an uproar over this approach to showing favoritism. Correction, those who did not receive were upset and those who did receive somehow justified it. Dear aunt Ruth probably knew the controversy she would create with her $100,000 dollar gift, but she also knew at the time of the award she would be in a position to NOT CARE!</p>
<p>This gets even better. After I received my check I called the prototyping company. I told them the story of  how I had come into $5,000 dolars to put toward the prototype. After they finally stopped laughing they got serious and told me they would make the prototype for the $5,000, because Aunt Ruth would have wanted them to.....TRUE STORY...</p>
<p>...I NEED MORE AUNT RUTH'S</p>
<h1>Help fund my project</h1>
<p>The Fuse-man is very close to becoming a reality. I have been through the design, prototyping and patenting process. I have contracted a manufacturer to produce my device and molds are being made with my first shipment of Fuse-men due in March of this year. I am asking for $5,000 in additional funding to implement the following:</p>
<p>- Rebuild and expand my website</p>
<p>- Initiate my product launch through Amazon and eBay</p>
<p>- Develop product material &amp; samples for hardware industry sales reps.</p>

With your support we can provide some peace of mind to a fellow fuse puller. Who knows, you may even save someone from harm and at the same time help me move forward with this new innovation. Remember there are 40+ million fuse panels out there that need a Fuse-man attached to them. There is probably someone somewhere right now standing in a dark room with no power and wondering if they should open that fuse panel. Let's empower them.
Ready to go!

Fuse-man Safety Stick
EVERY ONE NEEDS AN AUNT RUTH...
 Just a little tribute to my # 1 Backer... For two years I had been ""designing on a dime"" my Fuse-man project and had once again run out of money. I had my first run of cad drawings complete. I had a quote of $9,000 from a prototyping company to make my first working model. It seemed like a reasonable amount but, as I said, I was broke! I told them to be patient, that I would, somehow, come up with the funds. So I taped my drawings back up to the office wall and resigned myself to more waiting on my dream concept.
A few days later I got a call from my mom telling me something special was in the mail from my recently deceased aunt. Then she added, in almost a whisper, ""not everybody gets one"". A few days after the mysterious phone call, I received a letter from an attorney in Florida notifying me that the Estate of my Aunt Ruth had been settled and I was a beneficiary! Apparently she had made a list of all her nieces and nephews (exactly 47 names).  She then methodically lined through each name that did not ""measure up"" and conversely made a star by each name that did. Being a 6th grade school teacher her whole life, that made perfect sense. (One of my uncles has the actual list.) Each of the twenty finalist were awarded a check for $5,000 dollars. Of course, when I received my letter I immediately called my sister to see if she had made the cut, so to speak, and of course, if she knew who might have been left out. As you can imagine, within days, the whole family was in the know and in an uproar over this approach to showing favoritism. Correction, those who did not receive were upset and those who did receive somehow justified it. Dear aunt Ruth probably knew the controversy she would create with her $100,000 dollar gift, but she also knew at the time of the award she would be in a position to NOT CARE!
This gets even better. After I received my check I called the prototyping company. I told them the story of  how I had come into $5,000 dolars to put toward the prototype. After they finally stopped laughing they got serious and told me they would make the prototype for the $5,000, because Aunt Ruth would have wanted them to.....TRUE STORY...
...I NEED MORE AUNT RUTH'S
Help fund my project
The Fuse-man is very close to becoming a reality. I have been through the design, prototyping and patenting process. I have contracted a manufacturer to produce my device and molds are being made with my first shipment of Fuse-men due in March of this year. I am asking for $5,000 in additional funding to implement the following:
- Rebuild and expand my website
- Initiate my product launch through Amazon and eBay
- Develop product material & samples for hardware industry sales reps.
Your Contributions or just spreading the word is greatly appreciated... Joel",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our founder’s Fur-Baby Emma is one of those statistics.  Emma is the reason for the development of the Noise-Cancelling Headset for Dogs.  Two years ago, during a 4th of July Fireworks show, Emma ran away.  What happened: Colored explosions drip across the night sky. Their reflections dance along water across the bay.  The sound from the fireworks reverberates in my ears while my eyes drink in the night's wonder.  Then, at ground level, a white streak enters and exits my field of vision in the blink of an eye.   It takes me a second to realize, another dog has just ran away due to the loud 4th of July firework show.  Family members then start to yell my dog's name.  My heart stops, and I feel weak and helpless.  My dog is now another statistic and I am freaking out.  A run-away.  My family also realises what has just occured, and all get up immediately, in a panic and set off in the direction of our new runaway. After what seemed like hours, Emma was found down the street.  Thankfully, she had been taken into a garage by a neighbor to ride out the rest of the firework show.Like many dogs, Emma is scared of all kinds of loud noises.  Alarms, Motorcycles, Thunderstorms, Fireworks, etc. The Journal Of American Veterinary Medical Association reported 30% of dogs suffer from some type of storm anxiety; and 86% of dogs with thunder phobia develop separation anxiety.  I tried CBD oil and treats, doggie thundershirts, playing soothing music, nothing worked for Emma.

Every aspect of the Pawnix headset has been designed with a dog in mind. There is no heavy plastic for them to knock off of their head.  It is designed to be soft and cushioned with lots of noise dampening foam.  We have tested different foams, including acoustic foams, and combined them in order to provided the highest Noise Reduction Rating for the dog.  All this foam also make it like they are wear a giant pillow on their head!  So comfortable!

the natural sounds of the waves location, gives a relaxing and soothing effect against

<p>Having a strong focus on the continual workout will come
through onto the screen as close ups of their face, breath, eyes, hands and
legs will portray this muscular pain. Furthermore, the ripple effect that the
boat gives as the rowers travel across the sea calms the situation, as the repetitive
sound of the water gives a soothing effect to the viewer. Additionally, this comforts
both athletes, as it is a reminder that this sport, besides the physical and
mental pain, brings a realisation of the natural world that this early morning
regime has to offer. </p>
<p><b>Funding</b> - All the donations will go towards waterproof housing equipment, a drone (flying camera) and Go Pro accessories so we can attach the camera to the boat/rowers, in order to show the passion, grit and intimate feel of the sport. We really appreciate all the help and support towards the making of our film.</p>

legs will portray this muscular pain. Furthermore, the ripple effect that the
boat gives as the rowers travel across the sea calms the situation, as the repetitive
sound of the water gives a soothing effect to the viewer. Additionally, this comforts
both athletes, as it is a reminder that this sport, besides the physical and
mental pain, brings a realisation of the natural world that this early morning
regime has to offer. 
Funding - All the donations will go towards waterproof housing equipment, a drone (flying camera) and Go Pro accessories so we can attach the camera to the boat/rowers, in order to show the passion, grit and intimate feel of the sport. We really appreciate all the help and support towards the making of our film.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns
