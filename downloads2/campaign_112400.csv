The idea for an event sparked a bigger vision: an organization with a mission to promote reading, bring together readers from diverse backgrounds and uplift marginalized voices. </p><p>This year, we're back with the second annual BookNet Fest, happening on September 7-8th in Orlando, FL. As a non-profit event, we need your help to cover costs for renting the convention space and audio/visual equipment. Even if you are unable to attend the event, supporting us today helps us for future years and makes it more likely we'll be able to make the content of the event available to all.</p><h2>What We Need</h2><p>Registration costs for the event are going towards renting the convention space. This year's convention space costs have been fully funded by tickets already sold.</p><p>However, in addition to that, audio/visual costs will be around $4,500. This includes mics, speakers, projectors and a technician to help us during the event. Our goal with this campaign is to raise this amount so that we can better improve accessibility and, with the internet package that is available onsite, hopefully record the panels to share them online after the festival.</p><p>Should we reach that goal, additional monies raised would go towards signage, helping marginalized creators attend the event and next year's event.</p><h2>What We Want To Do</h2><p>Like we said above, our mission is to make BookNet feel as inclusive and equal as possible.</p><p>This campaign is an effort to help BookNet reach as many people as possible. We understand that feeling dismissed or ignored at industry conferences is not the only way that creators and fans can be excluded from the bookish community.</p><p>We know that for many marginalized creators the cost of attending an event like this at all is impossible. To film the unique and in depth panels at this event to immortalize online would create an invaluable resource for impoverished creators.</p><p><strong>We believe the book community should be an empowering place for all creators, no matter who or where they are.</strong></p><p>From our sponsored marginalized attendee this year, Lily of LilyMeadeBooks on YouTube:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">When I first received the email asking me if I would like to attend BookNet this fall, I was honored. When I realized that it was all expenses covered, I started crying.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For several years I have been transparent about my struggles to stay and engage in the book community--a source of deep inspiration, passion, and friendship for me, but also a place that is difficult to keep up with if you can't afford the latest books, classes or edits to improve your craft, or travel costs to go to events.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I have only ever been to two industry related events before. Both times I was helped in some way by family or a friend and I also saved for ages, but I still ended up so stressed and guilty about the costs that I would cry myself to sleep for weeks before attending. I spent every second that I was there doing my best to make it worth it, not only for me, but for others like me.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I picked panels to attend based on how helpful they would be to someone at home and brought my camera to every one, sacrificing my own personal enjoyment to make sure I had a recording to share on my YouTube channel (however shaky and amateur the results may be). To this day, those panels are my most viewed videos, receiving thousands of views a year and many comments thanking me for posting them.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I don't know how to express my gratitude to BookNet not only for inviting me, but for going to such lengths to help others. Books and access to education are two of my biggest values and this is a perfect combination of both. This is a truly incredible cause and I hope to do everything in my power to help make it an annual event.</p><h2>Let's Talk Perks</h2><p>For your support, we've got an amazing list of perks set up, from book recommendations from our panelists to annotated books to bookish swag to query critiques!</p><p><strong>On-Screen Thank You</strong> - $3<br/>Thank you for supporting BookNet Fest.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>About the Authors:</strong> <u>Scott Cote</u> has based some of the tech system details on his personal experience as an inventor. His current company is developing an advanced AI solution for healthcare that mirrors the hero system in Medica. It is called Grr-ithm, Inc. He has been involved in healthcare in its many forms for over 16 years. Scott has been happily married for 22 years and has 3 beautiful daughters.</p>
<p><u>Dr. Johannes Lierfeld </u>is a scientist and long time fictional writer. He has developed over 20 screenplays, sold 3 series concepts, and wrote the screenplay for the award-winning and critically acclaimed dystopian SciFi thriller ""2012"" (the 2007 version.) He is a lecturer at both Philipps-University and the University of Cologne, teaching screenwriting and narrative concepts.  His habilitation thesis focused on Artificial Intelligence and its effects on  society. Johannes and Scott have already completed the screenplay for the TV pilot for Medica. They are presenting the script to industry leaders in production.</p>
<p><strong>Our campaign and why it's important to us.</strong> Medica isn't just a book, it is a portrayal of possibilities. The novel takes on the existential threat mankind could be faced with through  Artificial Intelligence and overpopulation. Could an elitist society control  mankind through the current healthcare system and its vulnerabilities? Could they implement a veiled depopulation lottery? Could advanced Artificial Intelligence be used to guide humanity to major breakthroughs in understanding, solving, and curing disease? Although Medica is a fictional tale, it is riddled with facts and amazing medical solutions you didn't even know existed.</p>
<p>We promise to excite you, tug on your heart strings, keep you on your toes, inspire you with possibilities, thrill you with intense mystery and show you there is a hero on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what we need.</strong> We are asking for your help to raise funds for self-publishing our novel Medica. The funds will cover; book editing, website build, Copyright registration, ISBN numbers, formatting for different e-book formats, legal costs for contracts with Amazon...,book cover design, and a simple book trailer.</p>

<h3>""Ali to narod traži!""</h3>
<p>Ova rečenica se obično čuje kad se neko požali na količinu crnila i prepucavanja svake vrste u medijima. Možda to narod traži, možda je narod sistematski istreniran da baš to traži, a možda narod jednostavno nema izbora. Mi smo grupa ljudi koja vjeruje da je za zdravu i normalnu atmosferu u jednom društvu nužno da čovjek ima kvalitet izbor medija kojima će da posvećuje svoju pažnju. <strong>I kada smo shvatili da na domaćoj sceni ne postoji časopis kakav želimo - odlučili smo da ga stvorimo sami.</strong></p>

<p>Talas je nastao kao projekat Srđana Ivankovića i Borisa Maksimovića, koji su odlučili da svoju frustraciju trenutnim izborom na kioscima i ljubav ka kvalitetno dizajniranim časopisima ispunjenim dobrim sadržajem pretoče u jedan konkretan projekat.

<p>I tako je nastao Talas, <strong>kvalitetno </strong>odštampan časopis <strong>vrhunskog</strong> dizajna koji donosi inspirativne i iscrpne intervjue s ljudima koji se trude da poprave svijet oko sebe, ali i obilje sadržaja iz svih oblasti kulture i umjetnosti.

Papir je najprimjereniji oblik za sadržaj koji mi donosimo, a to su iscrpni i sveobuhvatni tekstovi koji s vremenom ne gube na značaju. Možda dnevnim novinama prijeti izumiranje jer su izgubile trku sa internetom, ali periodična štampa nije mrtva i njena budućnost i leži u specijalizovanim časopisima iz niše, khm, kao što je Talas :)  Osim toga, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2015/09/16/paper-vs-digital/#4dcba2bf33c3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">neurolozi</a> su dokazali da štampana izdanja ostvaruju daleko više pozitivnih uticaja na naš mozak u odnosu na digitalna. Ono što pročitate u jednom štampanom časopisu ostavlja dublji trag, izaziva više asocijacija nužnih za pamćenje i povezivanje činjenica i daleko više opušta tijelo nego čitanje na internetu. Da rezimiramo, Talas nije časopis, Talas je lijek za opadanje pažnje i fokusiranosti koja nas sve više i više pogađa. </p>

In each country, one reporter will cover his/her part of the story i.e. will follow one person who deals with the smog on a daily basis - a doctor, a researcher, a person who suffers from air pollution, a factory worker, an activist, etc.Online, real time, simultaneous reportingOn the  May 5th, all 8 journalists and photojournalists will live report from their countries. The audience will be able to follow the work of correspondents as it unfolds. We created a dedicated website where all insights from the ground will be gathered. You can find it here: http://outride.rs/en/making-of-deepbreath/In times of fake and alternative news, we want to be transparent. We also want to create an interesting social media event focused on journalism. Therefore, all reporters will work the same day and share parts of their work online that exact day. You will be able to follow reporters while they work.Interactive storyThe interactive reportage will put together all of stories from 8 countries.This way, we will be able to show and explain the smog problem from different angles, not only one side and perspective. Our report will combine data journalism with doctors and researchers comments as well as with personal stories of people suffering from air pollution. All in 1. We also made sure to include the countries where environmental issues are still underreported. Putting them together with known polluted places, it will make a bigger impact on people's awareness of the problem.Our aim is to focus on personal stories of people who deals with often invisible pollution. We want to encourage everyone to rethink the way we affect the climate as well as how as a consequence the climate affects us.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>What is Missy/Ink Magazine?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>We have some great perks! Digital copies, subscriptions, shout outs, NATIONAL ad spaces, and more! </strong></h3>
<p>Missy/Ink Magazine was started in 2012 by Bella Rouge and Dana Brushette - it has grown immensely in just one year. We started Missy/Ink because we were tired of what was available for women in the tattoo magazine genre - they are all directed at men! We want to change that. Missy/Ink is a female centric tattoo lifetyle magazine that focuses on womens interests, and expands the idea of what beauty is to all shapes and sizes. <br/><br/>Having Missy/Ink on shelves across Canada (and eventually The United States) would mean the world to us - it would be the difference between growing the business, or staying local and not expanding past what we have already become in a short period. We believe our success thus far is because women are very interested in what we have to offer, and really love the overall message Missy/Ink puts forward.</p>
<p>By helping us get on shelves you will be kickstarting a small business into full working mode - we will be able to pay salary for our magnificent team. You will be helping to create real jobs for real women.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Printing Costs A LOT!</h3>
<p>This $3000 will be going strictly towards printing the magazines first run of Issue 12 for January 2014. The cost for small run prints is quite a lot, but as we grow and print in larger quantities this cost will go significantly down. Even if we don't reach our entire goal, the money we do raise will go 100% to printing. We have been able to sustain ourselves so far with advertising sales and magazine sales through magcloud.com but to move forward we really need to step up our game. <br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Impact Statement</h3>
<p>As mentioned, by funding this campaign you will be helping to fund and create more jobs in the Canadian workforce. Missy/Ink currently has an Editor in Chief, Associate Editor, Graphic Designer, Copy Editor and Event Coordinator as well as help from an administrative assistant. There is still space for SO MANY more employees - you will be investing in a growing company in Canada. Small business is the heart of Canada, and keeps the economy going.</p>

<p><strong>The first thing I'm going to do is find a good marketing agent that will get my books to the same market that is driving Shades of Grey.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then keep on writing.  My second novel is even spicier then my first with deeper insights into the characters and darker scenes that tantalize.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong character development, a good storyline and steamy sex scenes can bring fantasy into reality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keeping it real by self publishing!</strong></p>
<p>Since publishing my first novel, I have really enjoyed being in control of my own work, not having signed my rights away to some publishing house.  Which means I can determine who prints my book, how many books are printed and how my book is marketed.  I can even turn it into a movie, or a few different movies, if I like, since I didn't sign the rights to my characters away to anyone else.</p>
<p>The downfall of self publishing is that it comes with all the costs of production.  Not only do I need to buy the publishing package to get it printed, but I need to pay for an editor and someone to help with marketing.  </p>
<p>With my first novel, I only had enough funds to get it published. I had friends and family do the editing, which was helpful, but not as professional as I would have liked.  I have also noticed that while the writing fills me with passion and drive, the marketing doesn't come so easy.  The little energy I have put into advertising has shown positive results.  I would like to be able to offer a monetary exchange for someone who's savvy in this industry and can wave their wand for my benefit!</p>
<p><strong>With enough funding I will be able to complete the writing of this second novel, have both of my novels professionally edited and published and create a solid marketing campaign.</strong></p>

<p>Shortly after I got divorced in my early 30's I had a hard time getting to sleep with my mind going in circles about what was going on in my life at that time. The only way I could get any rest was to tell myself a story. I found myself diving into the mythical and historical world of Lady Caroline Hathaway. </p>
<p>Being raised Catholic in a deep South, land loving, matriarchal family, I found myself pulled to pagan teachings, finding the earth based traditions something tangible that I could honor on a daily basis, instead of in some building somewhere... looking outside of myself for the answers.</p>
<p>Becoming Pagan kind of felt like ""coming out"" in a way. I felt as if I could and would be mocked and criticized.  After learning about how the earth-based traditions were driven out of us in such dire ways, I felt I remembered being chastised for my beliefs to the point of death.  Fortunately, in this day and age we need not worry about being killed for our beliefs. I felt compelled to explore my true path.</p>
<p>As I began studying the ways of the moon and the aspects of the Goddess, I began to wonder what life would have been like during the period when these teachings flourished. Could there have been a woman who experienced the abrupt shift in consciousness from being revered for her powers for most of her life to being condemned as a witch?</p>
<p>The story of Lady Caroline Hathaway in ""All Acts of Love and Pleasure Are Her Rituals"" (buy it as a perk or visit <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/All-Acts-Love-Pleasure-Rituals/dp/1432744747/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.amazon.com/All-Acts-Love-Pleasure-Rituals/dp/1432744747/</a>), follows this journey of one woman's tale through the end of an era.  She is born into a secret society where predictions of her life foreshadow their actual events and cause her father to steer her away from her heritage.</p>
<p>As she grows into her power, she turns to the mythical figure of her grandmother for support and guidance, but Grandmother's teachings can only take her so far.  Lost in a world without guidance and filled with a passion so intense, she doesn't know how to quell it, she turns to the Doctor, an elder in the society, for support.  The Doctor not only helps her to navigate the ways of the body to treat ailments, but he also teaches her the power of submission.  These treatments though bondage and masochism are the only path Caroline can find to relinquish her passion and fully give herself over to the unknown.</p>
<p>Her tale not only follows the mythic qualities of coming into her Priestess path, it also dives into the deep erotic nature of human desire.  It explores a time where love was not chastised and sex was freely exchanged, between women and between men. When the earth was worshiped, the body was worshipped. When nature became chastised so did our inherent lusty drives.</p>
<p>Being a believer in a more polyamorous lifestyle, my novel explores the nature of open relationships where commitments do not constrain the partners from enjoying others.  Caroline finds herself in love with a man she can never truly have, only to be committed to him in such a way that is threatened when she meets the man who will help her realize her full potential. What happens when these worlds collide?  Can Caroline share her life with these two men?  And can these two men share their lives with each other?</p>
<p>Before writing this novel, I scoured the shelves looking for a similar story.  As a single woman who was not dating much, I craved erotic literature.  But something was missing.  Sure sex tales are fun and erotica has a certain musky flourish to it that captivates the senses, but I wanted more.  I wanted to be involved with the characters. I wanted a good storyline that had good sex, not some regurgitated tripe that used flowery metaphors to allude to the sex act.  I found a few books like Starhawk's ""Fifth Sacred Thing,"" and Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Mists of Avalon"" that held my interests in the tale and contained some steamy scenes, but that still wasn't quite enough for me.</p>
<p>So, as I drifted off to sleep at night, I lived in Caroline's world.  And as I drove through the streets of Los Angeles for hours at a time to organize community based tree planting projects, Caroline's tale passed the time.  She became such a strong character in my psyche, I felt that if I didn't sit down and write her story, then I could possibly be taken over by her if I received a good blow to the head.</p>
<p>That's why I say it is not a story that I wrote, but a story that came pouring through me.  After making the decision to write the novel, it took me nine months to complete it.  After that, I held some private book readings and raised funds by selling pre-orders for my novels.  It is because of those 75 people who purchased the novel before it was published that made it happen.  If I did not have their belief and support and promise to fulfill, the manuscript would still be in a drawer somewhere under my bed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have published it and many more people have been able to read it and be touched by it.  Some people connect with it on a deep level and some people don't.  Regardless, many have told me how brave I am to put it out there. I hope that telling this tale will inspire others to live their dreams by expressing themselves as fully as they can.</p>
<p>This second novel, “The Initiation of Lady Caroline”, is not a sequel or a prequel, it's what I call a ""withinquel"" because it takes those pauses in between the chapters or the sentences that sum things up and dives into them.  It broadens the characters and reveals the driving force behind their decisions.  It takes Caroline's relationship with the Doctor to deeper and darker levels, letting us know just how far she can go.</p>
<p><strong>""We tend to think of the erotic as an easy, tantalizing sexual arousal. I speak of the erotic as the deepest life force, a force which moves us toward living in a fundamental way."" ~ Audre Lorde</strong></p>
<p>My life aside from being a writer is dedicated to localism and community organizing around land stewardship and traditional practices. I am on the board of our local Transition Town movement, an active member of our local Grange and am a certified permaculture designer. I walk my talk by shopping locally, eating organically, driving a BioDiesel and ensuring that my books are printed on demand in the USA.  (If only they could be printed on hemp paper at a reasonable cost!)</p>
<p>I have been ordained as a priestess from the 13 Moon Mystery School and initiated into the Third Road Faerie tradition.</p>
<p>As a believer in sharing the wealth and supporting those who make a contribution to this world, I am also donating a portion of the proceeds of this campaign and all book sales to The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, an organization dedicated to healthy reproduction and reproductive choices for all.*</p>
<p>My hope is that my novels will bring forth the erotic nature not only sexually, but sensually and powerfully connected to the earth and all of her bounty.</p>

<h3>This Book MARGARET is about a REAL Person</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Imagine being a woman with a rebellious streak, who doesn't want to settle for marriage and domesticity, but is trapped by conservative disfuntional grieving parents who moved their children to the other side of the world. Imagine it's in the mid 1930s and the opportunities for women who want more simply don't exist.  This book explores the passions and desires of a woman born 50 years too early for the life she really wanted to lead.   But it also explores the limited choices for women in the 40s and 50s who step outside of what society dictates as acceptable and how some managed to briefly step around the fringes of convention.  </p>
<p>Not only is it an excellent story, but it will make you think.   I've created mystery, intrigue, sexuality, and murder - and this story is based on a real person named Margaret whom I came to know briefly when she was in her 80s.  I was intrigued by what would drive a loving mother from her children - to turn her back on them completely, and so the story unfolded.  </p>
<p>My name is Maria Carlton - and this is my first novel - I've also just finished the first draft of another, and the sequel to Margaret is now started.   I've had fantastic reviews for Margaret from the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Awards where it made it to the Top 10% of entries early in 2013.   </p>
<p>Now to complete the publishing process, I need to not only fund the final production costs - I'm going to work with a well established Cooperative publishing house in the UK, who is keenly waiting for this manuscript - and we intend to have it ready for sale in time for Christmas this year.   </p>
<p>Your contribution which I've effectively tried to offer as pre-ordering options will enable the publication process to be sped up - and also to enable sufficient marketing of the book to ensure that the sequel and my other book is brought to market quickly.   </p>
<p>I've written top selling non-fiction books, but intend to move into becoming a full time fiction author within 3 years - that means creating a strong back catalogue quickly.  </p>

<p><b>The mission</b></p>
<p>I'm Tina Closser, also known as science fiction author Paige Daniels, and I've teamed together with fellow sci-fi author, Mary Fan, to tackle a subject near and dear to our hearts. We've
both been avid devourers of books since we were young girls, especially when it
came to sci-fi stories, with worlds as
unlimited as the
imagination. However, something
seemed to be missing: the
presence of strong tech-savvy leading ladies. Sure, there were plenty of impossibly
sexy babes ready to kick butt in their
four-inch heels and
bumbling, brainy side kicks playing second fiddle to the
main protagonist, but
rarely would a smart, tech-savvy
woman make it to the forefront of a story.</p>
<p>Well, as
they say, if you
want something done right, you
gotta do it yourself.So we,
Paige and Mary, teamed
up to take a
step toward changing this. We're collecting stories from brilliant authors
that feature smart and strong heroines in the lead. The goal of this book is to
show girls there are more roles for them than just a sidekick or a sexy babe.
We feel if girls can see themselves in a role then they can become it. As an
added bonus, all of the profits will be given to a Society of Women Engineers
scholarship fund.</p>

<p><b>The Masterminds</b></p>
<p>So just who are we? Let’s answer in our own words…</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I grew up in various towns
around Northern Kentucky reading and watching as much science fiction and
fantasy as humanly possible. When it was time for college it was clear that I
watched one too many episodes of Star Trek, because I chose Physics as my major
with the intent of being an Astrophysicist. After graduating from Northern
Kentucky University with my Bachelors of Science in Physics, I knew that
academia was not the path for me so I chose to get an Electrical Engineering
degree at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Armed with two science
degrees, I went to work for the Navy in Indiana.</span></p>
<p>Throughout high school and
college I had millions of ideas for stories running through my head, but never
had the courage to write any of them down. Thanks to the reality TV craze, I
turned off my television and worked up the courage to write down a story that
had been worming its way into my brain for years. I wrote “Non-Compliance: The
Sector” under the pen name of Paige Daniels over the course of several years.
In November 2012, it was published by Kristell Ink. In September of 2013, the
follow-up novel, “Non-Compliance: The Transition” was published. Both are fast
paced science fiction, cyberpunk tales with elements of humor and romance with
a strong heroine. It explores different themes such as family, government
control, and how one seemingly insignificant person can make a difference. </p>
<p>Despite being surrounded by a bunch
of Hoosiers, I have lived happily in Indiana for the past fourteen years. I
have held several different engineering positions in the past, but currently, I
am a Science Technology Engineering and Math Coordinator... basically it's my job to get kids excited about science. </p>
<p>I am also very active in my
local chapter of Society of Women Engineers, doing many outreach programs to
inspire girls to consider the field of engineering as a career.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I coach a
robotics team and attend various robotics competitions. I also fiddle around
with my viola and like to pretend I know how to be a farmer on my small hobby
farm with my two kids and husband. </p>

<p>I’m a lifelong nerd. My teen years were spent measuring the
speed of light at physics camp and building robots for school competitions. I
built my first Star Wars fansite when I was 12 and was scribbling my own space
operas at 13. Of course, none of them were very good, but that doesn't mean I
stopped… In fact, my debut novel, <i>Artificial
Absolutes </i>(released by Red Adept Publishing in 2013) is a space opera with
a dash of cyberpunk and the first book in the “Jane Colt” series. The sequel, <i>Synthetic Illusions</i>, came out earlier
this year, and I’m working on Book Three.</p>
<p>In addition, I also write young adult fantasy, with two
series, “Flynn Nightsider” (dystopian fantasy) and “Fated Stars” (high
fantasy), under contract with Glass House Press. A prequel novella to “Flynn
Nightsider”, titled <i>The Firedragon </i>(about
a monster-fighting teen girl), was released a few months back.</p>
<p>I've spent the past several months pounding the pavement at
sci-fi/fantasy conventions on the East Coast, from Central PA Comic Con, in
which I argued why sci-fi was the best genre of all on a panel with two fellow
authors, to Balticon, where the black-and-red wings I wore probably did more to
sell books at my booth than my pitching. And I've just started…</p>
<p><b>The stories</b></p>
<p>We can’t give away any specifics about the actual stories
going into the anthology, since we’re still collecting submissions and won’t
make a final decision until after the November 15 deadline for authors, but we
can tell what kinds of tales we’d accept.</p>
<p>The only requirement for the submissions, other than that it
be appropriate for young readers, is that the protagonist be a teen girl who
can handle her tech –  like a hacker, a
starship mechanic, a robot engineer, or a biopunk scientist. Since we’re open
to any and all sub-genres of sci-fi, the stories could be anything from mildly
futuristic technothrillers to out-of-this-world space adventures.</p>
<p>Through the selection and editing process, we will ensure
that each story is tightly written, well-paced, and fully developed.</p>
<p><b>The nuts and bolts</b></p>
<p>So just where will your dollars go if you choose to donate?
The quick answer is: straight to the book’s production. Both of us are happily
donating our time to this project, and the authors are donating their stories.
The money we’re raising here will pay for the costs of professional editing, proofreading,
formatting, and artwork for the interior illustrations, as well
as marketing collateral such as bookmarks and online banner ads. </p>
<p>To be 100% transparent with where your dollars would be going,
let’s take you through the exact process we’re planning to follow:</p>
<p>Step 1: Collect and curate stories from a talented pool of
sci-fi authors, who are graciously donating their work</p>
<p>Step 2: Hire a professional editor to whip the stories into
top-notch shape, from closing up plot holes to smoothing out character
development</p>
<p>Step 3: Hire a professional proofreader to zap any pesky
typos and iron out any grammatical issues</p>
<p>Step 4: Commission or purchase rights to appropriate artwork
to illustrate the anthology (one illustration per story)</p>
<p>Step 5: Send the polished stories and artwork to a
professional book designer for formatting</p>
<p>Step 6: Upload the final product onto a variety of online
distribution platforms, including Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and iBooks, for e-book
and print-on-demand paperback releases</p>
<p>Step 7: Promote the anthology online via blog hops, social
media, and online ads, as well as in person at bookstores and sci-fi/fantasy
conventions</p>
<p>You might have noticed that we're taking the flexible funding option, that's because we're going to do this project no matter what. If we don't get fully funded we may have to skimp on things like illustrations for each story, but worry not, the book will be complete.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We’re grateful for any and all donations, and everyone
giving $50 or more will receive an acknowledgement in the anthology itself.
Depending on your level of donation, we’re also offering rewards in the form of
the book itself (of course), our previously published works (the
“Non-Compliance” cyberpunk series by Paige Daniels and the “Jane Colt” space
opera series by Mary Fan), paragraph dedications to donors or those who
inspired them, and prints of the <i>Brave
New Girls</i> cover art.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/672757/files/20140624145428-Brave-New-Girls-3D-BookCover-transparent_background.png?1403646868"" src="""" style=""width: 198.41576506955178px; height: 325px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/666415/files/20140622092807-books.jpg?1403454487"" src="""" style=""width: 374.66666666666663px; height: 281px;""/>  </p>
<br/><p>In addition, if you choose to rule as a Galactic Emperor,
Mary Fan will write a piece of sci-fi flash fiction (1,000 – 3,000 words)
starring you or a person of your choice (a child, a relative, a friend, etc.)
as the hero/heroine. This is more than a Tuckerization – it will be 100%
custom. So, for example, you could ask Mary to write a story about your
5-year-old daughter as a steampunk airship pilot, and she’ll happily oblige.</p>
<p>And if you want to be <i>really</i>
generous, you can rise to the exclusive role of Multiverse Deity, of which
there can only be one, naturally. If you choose to claim this title, Mary will
write a full-on short story (3,000 – 10,000 words) starring you or a person of
your choice. Same level of customization as the above – you could ask Mary to
write a story about your cyborg husband saving the world from flesh-eating
zombies, and she’s cool with that too.</p>
<p>In either case, these custom tales will be published as part
of the anthology with a special byline for the donor.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What’s the significance of encouraging girls in STEM? STEM
fields are one of the few jobs set to increase in the future. As a
matter of fact, the growth rate for STEM jobs in the next ten years is 18%
compared to 9% for non-STEM jobs. Translated: get a STEM degree and you’ll have
a job in a tough job market. However, the STEM job outlook for women isn’t as
great. By age 7 girls lose confidence in math and only 13% of engineers are
women. However, women who hold STEM degrees can potentially earn 33% more than
women in other fields.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/661699/files/20140619190345-photo__2_.jpg?1403229825"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>For a degree that holds such power, shockingly few women
earn them. One example is in the ever-growing world of programming: only 14% of
2013 graduates with computer science degrees were women. We hope by busting
stereotypes and showing girls the potential they all hold we can possibly be a
key to changing some of these statistics.</p>
<br/><p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Luckily, both of us (Paige and Mary) happen to be
professional project managers by day, and so we’re quite used to managing the
multitude of moving parts that come with handling complicated jobs. Between our
clear-cut plan and get ‘er done attitudes, we foresee this project going pretty
smoothly. However, we are also well aware of the risks associated with any
high-complexity project, which in this case primarily involve timing. </p>
<p>Though we've laid out a realistic plan based on our past
publishing experiences, with the goal of having the anthology out in midsummer
2015, unexpected hurdles could always throw it off. After all creativity can’t
be rushed, and we may need to stretch timelines to accommodate time for
revising both the stories and any custom artwork. And since our anthology has a
pretty specific theme, we may need to extend our submissions deadline,
currently set at November 15, 2014, if we don’t have enough appropriate stories
by then.</p>
<p>And, of course, both of us have a million other commitments,
between our day jobs, other writing projects, family (in Paige’s case), and
plotting to take over the world (in Mary’s case). So it’s entirely possible
that we’ll need extra time to read through all the submissions and coordinate
the publishing process.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Don't have the cash on hand to donate? That's okay, we understand times are tight. Consider writing a story or submitting art to the cause <a href=""http://bravenewgirls.weebly.com/submissions.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Giving us a shout out on your favorite forms of social media, telling a friend or acquaintance, or even words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.  </p>

opera series by Mary Fan), paragraph dedications to donors or those who
inspired them, and prints of the Brave
New Girls cover art.

  
In addition, if you choose to rule as a Galactic Emperor,
Mary Fan will write a piece of sci-fi flash fiction (1,000 – 3,000 words)
starring you or a person of your choice (a child, a relative, a friend, etc.)
as the hero/heroine. This is more than a Tuckerization – it will be 100%
custom. So, for example, you could ask Mary to write a story about your
5-year-old daughter as a steampunk airship pilot, and she’ll happily oblige.
And if you want to be really
generous, you can rise to the exclusive role of Multiverse Deity, of which
there can only be one, naturally. If you choose to claim this title, Mary will
write a full-on short story (3,000 – 10,000 words) starring you or a person of
your choice. Same level of customization as the above – you could ask Mary to
write a story about your cyborg husband saving the world from flesh-eating
zombies, and she’s cool with that too.
In either case, these custom tales will be published as part
of the anthology with a special byline for the donor.

  The Impact 

What’s the significance of encouraging girls in STEM? STEM
fields are one of the few jobs set to increase in the future. As a
matter of fact, the growth rate for STEM jobs in the next ten years is 18%
compared to 9% for non-STEM jobs. Translated: get a STEM degree and you’ll have
a job in a tough job market. However, the STEM job outlook for women isn’t as
great. By age 7 girls lose confidence in math and only 13% of engineers are
women. However, women who hold STEM degrees can potentially earn 33% more than
women in other fields.


For a degree that holds such power, shockingly few women
earn them. One example is in the ever-growing world of programming: only 14% of
2013 graduates with computer science degrees were women. We hope by busting
stereotypes and showing girls the potential they all hold we can possibly be a
key to changing some of these statistics.

  Risks & Challenges  
Luckily, both of us (Paige and Mary) happen to be
professional project managers by day, and so we’re quite used to managing the
multitude of moving parts that come with handling complicated jobs. Between our
clear-cut plan and get ‘er done attitudes, we foresee this project going pretty
smoothly. However, we are also well aware of the risks associated with any
high-complexity project, which in this case primarily involve timing. 
Though we've laid out a realistic plan based on our past
publishing experiences, with the goal of having the anthology out in midsummer
2015, unexpected hurdles could always throw it off. After all creativity can’t
be rushed, and we may need to stretch timelines to accommodate time for
revising both the stories and any custom artwork. And since our anthology has a
pretty specific theme, we may need to extend our submissions deadline,
currently set at November 15, 2014, if we don’t have enough appropriate stories
by then.
And, of course, both of us have a million other commitments,
between our day jobs, other writing projects, family (in Paige’s case), and
plotting to take over the world (in Mary’s case). So it’s entirely possible
that we’ll need extra time to read through all the submissions and coordinate
the publishing process.
  Other Ways You Can Help Don't have the cash on hand to donate? That's okay, we understand times are tight. Consider writing a story or submitting art to the cause here. Giving us a shout out on your favorite forms of social media, telling a friend or acquaintance, or even words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p></div>","Introduction
Hello! My name is Tania Elfersy and I am the co-creator, co-editor and publisher of Purple Leaves, Red Cherries. 
Once upon a time (really!) I had an idea to create a special gift for new mothers. A gift that would inspire, embrace and comfort new moms AND be so much more useful than anti stretch mark cream!
This idea became the book Purple Leaves, Red Cherries. 
About the Book
Within Purple Leaves, Red Cherries there are 48 very short stories on motherhood, stunning illustrations from the artist Nomi Melul Ohad, personal journal space and a Mothers' Toolkit with self-development exercises to help new moms come to grips with the impact of motherhood in their lives. 
Andrea Katzman (my co-creator and editor) and I carefully selected stories that uncover how moms are handling their relationships, work, expectations, sex lives and more.  
We hope that our book will help our readers feel that as they journey through motherhood, they are not alone. We also hope to encourage readers to share their own stories of motherhood.
A Self-Publishing Project
I am self-publishing the book.  
Did I approach any publishers? No! These days ""sisters (and moms) are doing it for themselves!"" The internet, ecommerce, social media and sites such as these make self-publishing an attractive alternative. 
Does this mean that I personally undertook ALL the tasks usually carried out by a big publishing firm? Absolutely not! In addition to working with Andrea and Nomi, I recruited a very talented design team, professional editors, proofreaders, web developers and a PR firm.
My creative team has helped make this book into a wonderful gift. I invite you to download two free chapters to see the results.http://purpleleavesredcherries.com/book/downloa...
To date, Advance Review Copies have been sent to the media and I am preparing for the book's launch in early May. 
In the meantime, I thought it would be a great idea to allow people to pre-order signed copies of the book and more. Great because it allows fans of the project to support us ahead of launch, and great because all money pledged will help cover the costs of the first printing round of 2,000 copies of the book.  
A Win-Win Campaign
With so many people excited about this book and wanting to help, I have created a win-win campaign.
I have already invested heavily in this project. However, printing the first round of 2,000 high-quality, offset, full color books is a large financial strain.
By connecting directly with customers through this site, I can offer Purple Leaves, Red Cherries perks at below the list price. 
This campaign's target is to raise $4,000 before the book's official launch date. $4,000 will cover a minor portion of the costs of the first printing round. Money raised above this amount will cover more of the printing costs and will be welcome! If I come anywhere close to covering the full printing costs I will update this page.
Our perks range from eternal gratitude (for a pledge of $1), an ebook of the short stories (for a pledge of $5), a hardback copy of the book signed by Andrea, Nomi and myself (for a pledge of $25) and a signed hardback copy of the book plus a high-quality poster print of a picture of your choice from the book, signed by Nomi (for a pledge of $60).  More details of these perks can be found in the green column on the right side of your screen.
The Future
I hope this campaign will reach its target and that I will stay up for nights on end signing and packaging books to send. However, even if I don't raise the complete amount, I will move forward with the launch plans and this beautiful book will come to market. 
Once launched, you will be able to buy the book through a third party, such as Amazon. A sale through Amazon of course will support the project but not the work of this self-publisher quite as much!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Hello, you beautiful book worms and avid readers.</h2>
<h3>My name is E.M. Moon  and I have been writing for almost 18 years. It has always been a strong passion of mine to develop ideas and gain inspiration from the world around me (and those fantastical realms of supposed fantasy and fiction) to write great stories.</h3>
<p>When I write, I think of the reader, and not just the story, not just me as the writer. I want people to pick up a piece of my writing and feel something from it, connect with the characters and story lines, put themselves into the stories, and make them think. I want to inspire others, not only in their lives as readers, but as creators in their own right. I want to incite creativity, create a haven from every day life, and fill the reader with an emotional whirlwind that has them literally FEELING and EXPERIENCING what I write, even if it is just words on paper.</p>
<p>I have been writing since about the age of twelve when I first discovered a little program called ""Microsoft Writer"" and typed up my first story about a possessed Dolly that wreaks havoc on a preteen and her friends (I know, it's been done :P )<br/>Since then I have started and stopped many a story, penning whatever inspires me at the moment, but  losing sight of an ending. Up until that point, writing had been merely a hobby for me, but I wanted it to turn in to so much more. I completed my first full length novel in 2014, and haven't stopped writing since, delving in to the world of self-publishing and trying to get it all out there.<br/>I currently am a stay at home mom to a beautiful, scarily intelligent and creative, 4 year old girl. I have a wonderful husband who is not only my best friend, but my creative think take and my number one supporter in my writing (and the process) and pushes me to do better and never give up.<br/>But enough about me personally...on to the stories and why you are here.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have literally turned in to an eternal fountain of never ending stories. Every day a new idea pops in to my head and I rush to write it down, lest I forget. I don't have enough time in my day to write all the things that I want to write, but I am driven to create original stories with unique characters and story lines that make people just itch for the next book in the series. I can write all day every day, but since I am a stay at home mom with a limited income, getting my books out to the masses has proven to be quite difficult.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491146605/a6snzxnqlo7aslqqxebq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Now that you have a feel and gotten a little taste for my work, let me tell you what my ultimate goal is with this campaign...</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is a thriving industry right now and more and more Indie Authors are able to get their works out to readers without having to go the traditional route of professional publishing. The problem with this can be a multitude of hurdles that you have to overcome just to peak a reader's interest.</p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>When you go the traditional route for publishing, the publishing company does a lot of the work for you. Once you have your book(s) professionally edited and your manuscript in the hands of the publisher and they decide to publish it, they work on the cover art, printing, and even marketing of your books. When you are an Indie Author, YOU have to do ALL of that on your own for the most part.</p>
<p>This can prove to be really difficult unless you have the monetary means and networking ability to advertise for yourself, market your work, and figure out all the right outlets to thrust yourself in to Book Land so that your stories end up in the hands of awesome readers.</p>

<p>As I said before (and I feel like a broken record at times) having limited funds and a small networking scope can virtually make you invisible in the independent publishing industry. I want this campaign to help me fund fun and unique ways to market my books, create swag for the readers, purchase paper copies for distribution to book stores and other sellers, as well as advertising for myself and networking at conventions.</p>
<p>I feel like my goal amount is a good start up to get the ball rolling and garner more readers and possibly publishers in the future. Funds will go towards marketing materials like flyers, stickers, buttons and other swag, website upgrades, advertisement on Facebook and Amazon, and booths at conventions where I can really interact with potential readers and sell my work.</p>

<h3>Now you know what I am working towards, but you are probably asking yourself, ""What do I get for supporting this campaign besides super cool new books to read?""</h3>
<p>Well, a lot of things.</p>
<p>Some of you will get credit for contributing to my writing endeavors on my author website and official Facebook page, paper and digital copies for books of your choosing, signed copies in paperback, fun swag likes signed pictures from book photo shoots, and a few of you could even get to work with me to create a very special character in one of my series and get credit for that character in the finished product!</p>

<p>I want to not only give you really cool stuff to read and physically collect, but the ability to be a part of my stories and my creative process. (Which is a doozy, mind you)</p>
<p>I am a person who hates to ask for things and not give anything in return. In a world where money can be tight, even for the best of us, I think that bartering/trading/and sharing of goods and not just cash can be a great way for us all to work as a community and help one another succeed. My perks will get you involved in the story, put the magic in your hands, and take you to a different place entirely. If for some reason this project doesn't get fully funded, I will still use what I have to put back in to this series and work even harder to get the stories in the hands of all you wonderful readers!</p>
<p>As with any project, there are always risks and challenges. Life isn't always forgiving, but like the characters that I create, I will overcome those hurdles. Writing is the one thing that I know I am good at; a talent that I want to share with everyone and not just  myself. I could say that it is a calling, and one that I've answered, so no matter the outcome of this project or future ones, I will still push to have my stories heard and give delight to those that I share them with.

</div></div>","Hello, you beautiful book worms and avid readers.
My name is E.M. Moon  and I have been writing for almost 18 years. It has always been a strong passion of mine to develop ideas and gain inspiration from the world around me (and those fantastical realms of supposed fantasy and fiction) to write great stories.
When I write, I think of the reader, and not just the story, not just me as the writer. I want people to pick up a piece of my writing and feel something from it, connect with the characters and story lines, put themselves into the stories, and make them think. I want to inspire others, not only in their lives as readers, but as creators in their own right. I want to incite creativity, create a haven from every day life, and fill the reader with an emotional whirlwind that has them literally FEELING and EXPERIENCING what I write, even if it is just words on paper.
I have been writing since about the age of twelve when I first discovered a little program called ""Microsoft Writer"" and typed up my first story about a possessed Dolly that wreaks havoc on a preteen and her friends (I know, it's been done :P )Since then I have started and stopped many a story, penning whatever inspires me at the moment, but  losing sight of an ending. Up until that point, writing had been merely a hobby for me, but I wanted it to turn in to so much more. I completed my first full length novel in 2014, and haven't stopped writing since, delving in to the world of self-publishing and trying to get it all out there.I currently am a stay at home mom to a beautiful, scarily intelligent and creative, 4 year old girl. I have a wonderful husband who is not only my best friend, but my creative think take and my number one supporter in my writing (and the process) and pushes me to do better and never give up.But enough about me personally...on to the stories and why you are here.
Like I said, I have literally turned in to an eternal fountain of never ending stories. Every day a new idea pops in to my head and I rush to write it down, lest I forget. I don't have enough time in my day to write all the things that I want to write, but I am driven to create original stories with unique characters and story lines that make people just itch for the next book in the series. I can write all day every day, but since I am a stay at home mom with a limited income, getting my books out to the masses has proven to be quite difficult.

This is what brings me to the meat of the campaign...
I have quite a few books that are already self-published through channels like Amazon and Creatspace and I have several stories that are being written as we speak. My goal is to really get these books seen, to get them in the hands and on the computer screens of readers like YOU. But as I said before, in this day and age when it comes to self-publishing and being an Indie Author, getting yourself out there can be quite difficult and surprisingly expensive. The S.A.I.N.T.S.

Because Filipino American History is American history. Because American history without Filipinos in it is an incomplete story. Because studies have shown that when children see themselves in their school books and history books, they do better academically. When children do better academically, doors open for them and they are able to gain skills to become our next generation of leaders: they will become our activists, lawyers, judges, policy makers, legislators, peace keepers, teachers, researchers, and our artists. When caregivers and communities are able to read these stories to Filipino American students, and families can read these books together, we are all reminded that we can accomplish great things together and as individuals. The next generation need to see themselves in a telling of American history in which Filipino Americans are acknowledged for their contributions to this country. This book series is one step closer to a richer, vibrant, relevant, and more accurate history of the United States.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508470615/aq3j0h5gl3v7lwpwff2m.png"" src=""""/></p><p>So yes, this matters for the Filipino American community and this matters to children and their families.

Depending on paper costs, printing pricing goes up or down. We could run into printing costs that are beyond what our funding campaign raised.

They’re also the oldest Asian group in US history. Despite this, Filipino American history is absent in public K-12 education and especially in children’s books.                                              Which is why I created Bridge + Delta Publishing, a Filipino American press focused on publishing stories where the Filipino American perspective is at the center of every story. As a children’s book author of Beautiful Eyes, a San Francisco Unified School District curriculum book, I saw there was a lack of publishers interested in the Filipino American experience.  We make up such a large population in the West Coast. But if Filipino Americans are the largest population of Asian Americans on the West Coast, then why aren’t publishers paying attention to our stories? Instead of asking this question countless times, I decided to just open up shop and create the publishing house that’s paying attention to Filipino American history, art and culture.One of the main goals of Bridge + Delta is to create a children’s book series that tells the stories of four Filipino American men and four Filipino American women who have changed US history. Our first book in the series is ""Journey for Justice: The Life of Larry Itliong,"" by Dr. Dawn Mabalon, a Stanford trained historian, San Francisco State University history professor,  and National Scholar and member of the Board of Trustees of the Filipino American National Historical Society.Illustrations are by Andre Sibayan, a California artist whose work has been front and center in promoting San Francisco Bay Area Filipino American cultural events, and who has created designs and art for Disney, Target, Quicksilver, the Gap and more.  Part of our goal in publishing the first book in this series is to incorporate ""Journey for Justice: The Life of Larry Itliong,"" into school district curriculum to be used in public education throughout the state of California.If we are able to reach beyond our funding goal, we would love to begin production on our next children's book in the Filipino American history eight-book series. What We Need & What You GetWe need $35,000 to help pay for production costs that goes into book publishing, like: 
Printing in the USA - these costs take up the bulk of any publishing budget
ISBN number and bar codes 
Additional design, illustration, editing
Meeting space (either online or physical, brick and mortar)
Research 
5% of funds will also go to two nonprofits, Filipino American National Historical Society and the Little Manila Foundation. 
Purchase the different perks in our donation campaign as holiday gifts, baby shower gifts, birthday gifts, for your family members or for your school! We're proud of the books and merchandise we're offering as perks when you donate. All of which are quality educational products for children and their families and students and their schools!                         The ImpactBut why does a Filipino American history book series for children even matter? Because Filipino American History is American history. Because American history without Filipinos in it is an incomplete story. Because studies have shown that when children see themselves in their school books and history books, they do better academically. When children do better academically, doors open for them and they are able to gain skills to become our next generation of leaders: they will become our activists, lawyers, judges, policy makers, legislators, peace keepers, teachers, researchers, and our artists. When caregivers and communities are able to read these stories to Filipino American students, and families can read these books together, we are all reminded that we can accomplish great things together and as individuals. The next generation need to see themselves in a telling of American history in which Filipino Americans are acknowledged for their contributions to this country. This book series is one step closer to a richer, vibrant, relevant, and more accurate history of the United States.So yes, this matters for the Filipino American community and this matters to children and their families. Ultimately, this matters on personal, local, state and national levels.Risks & ChallengesPrinting costs are similar to the stock market. Depending on paper costs, printing pricing goes up or down. We could run into printing costs that are beyond what our funding campaign raised. We can address that by printing a smaller amount of books or print less pages.It also takes some time to work with academics, editors, writers, graphic designers and illustrators. But we're on track to complete Journey for Justice at the end of December, with copies and perks mailed out in January 2018. We will update all of you throughout the process through Bridge + Delta Publishing news page, Instagram, Facebook page, and Indiegogo page.Our team is experienced in production and publications. While there are always some hiccups in production, we have knowledgeable leadership, and a deadline driven team. A little bit about our team:Publisher/Editor: Gayle Romasanta is a published author and writer, with a publication history that spans over 20 years. She has written for one of the largest media/news companies in the United States, the McClatchy Company, and has been a founding editor for numerous magazines and literary journals. Her work has been published in newspapers, magazines, anthologies, as a children's book, commercials and for the stage. She is also the founder of the Filipino American sorority, Kappa Psi Epsilon, with chapters at University of California, Davis, Los Angeles, California State University Long Beach, Sacramento and San Francisco State University.Writer/Researcher/History Series Curator: Dr. Dawn Mabalon, the curator of this history series, is a third generation Filipina born and raised in Stockton, California, the daughter and granddaughter of farmworkers and teachers, and an associate professor of history at San Francisco State University. She’s also the author of books, articles, essays and poetry about the Filipino American experience. Her books include Little Manila is in the Heart: The Making of the Filipina/o American Community in Stockton, California, Filipinos In Stockton, and she was a co-editor of Filipinos in San Francisco. She serves as a National Scholar and Trustee of the Filipino American National Historical Society and is the co-founder of the Little Manila Foundation in Stockton, California. She received an M.A. in Asian American Studies from UCLA and a PhD in American history from Stanford University.Illustrator/Graphic Design: Andre Sibayan is a seasoned illustrator and graphic designer.

</h3><p>Hi, my name is Dwier Brown and I had the amazing fortune to
be in one of the best baseball movies of all time, Field of Dreams, a movie
that impacted my life in ways I never could have imagined.  Over the years, I’ve had countless
strangers come up to me and tell me the profound way that film has changed
their lives and their relationships with their fathers. I started to write
these stories down, not just the stories from these strangers, but the stories
from the film set, the stories of the changing relationship with my own father,
the stories of amazing coincidences, that just like the movie, were so full of
magic, I almost couldn’t believe they were real. 
</p><p>I always
thought, someday, I’ll write a book.</p>
<p>Well that day is here and as I’ve been working on my final
edits, I realized, my dream was not just to write a book, my dream is to
connect with all of you through this book. As James Earl Jones’ character says
in Field of Dreams “America has rolled by like an army of stream rollers. It
has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. But baseball has
marked the time. This field, this game: it’s a part of our past. It reminds us
of all that once was good and could be again.” </p>
<p>My dream is to
meet all of you at baseball parks across America and for an afternoon we could
all put away our laptops and cell phones and enjoy the simple pleasure of
meeting face to face, of telling each other stories of little league and
backyard games of catch, of our fathers, of baseball. </p>
<p>Here is where I need your help. In order to do an old
fashioned RV book tour like this, where I’m not hustled from one appointment to
another, but can take the time to truly connect and go to your hometowns and
baseball fields, I need to be independently funded.  Some people have told me this is impossible but I believe
that together, we humans are capable of just about anything. Or more
appropriately put I believe in the philosophy “If you build it …” </p><h3>

Right now, I'm just at the point that I don't want to wait any longer and I want to ""Just Do It!"".I expect this to take approximately 3-4 months to complete, perhaps  less if I really push it, but I prefer to do this properly rather than hastily. I will definitely complete it regardless of the funds received as I want it for myself anyway. But a successful campaign would help me finish it sooner rather than later, as I wouldn't have to worry about real life expenses and I could devote myself to this.What will you get back?Besides my eternal gratitude? Depending on the amount, you'll either get your name in the credits, a free t-shirt, an e-book or also a printed book or a conference call explaining the book -any parts you would like.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Polytheist Leadership Conference – and 2014 is the fourth and most
community-focused year in the Otherfaith! We're a modern polytheistic
religion seeking to get more involved in our connected communities,
and Aine Llewellyn heads the faith.</p>
<p>We hope to raise enough money in this
campaign to send Aine to this conference, where a variety of
polytheists will be meeting, all with the goal of growing polytheism.

</li>
<li>
<p>The chance to speak at the

I've always been a poet but up until a year ago I was an unpublished poet. You see I signed a publishing contract with Tate publishing and I realized that I didn't have a clue about the business. So decided to start a facebook page called Jo's Poetry Excerpts from My resume. I started out with a video blog of me tracking my journey as I wrote my next book. It was pretty rough. But aren't first ventures all that way. Learn as you go for the novice. Well that's me. I also posted poetry and journal entries from my writing. I chronicled my process and every question I thought was pertinent to self publishing. I blogged just every step I took and i shared insights to my own self as I grew and learned. <br/>I talked about writing of course. But also the very beginnings, like what's my title going to be and what's the subject matter. There's a video on inspiration, encouragement, marketing, a few a those, daily insights, legal stuff like, copyrights and getting grants to publish. That was a bust. All the way up to formatting and what not to do and don't do that again. As well as videoing some early phases of spoken word. It got better. trust me. <br/>so now I'm once again at printing. Because it takes money and while I've been very creative at putting myself out there and building an audience and selling my work piece by piece. It gets expensive. And when you're just starting out in the industry you don't get paid much. So every time I thought I had a little money saved I realized I need so much more.<br/>So this project is to help me raise the money I need to print ""Jo's Poetry Excerpts from My Resume"" the book.<br/>I decided that i will need about 400 to 500 books to start. That's going to cost about $1,600. Now this will include the cost of the actual printing and the cover of the book. <br/>If I don't reach my goal then what ever money I do receive will go to the printing only of as many books as possible. I will go with a generic cover with just the words on it. <br/>My project is in my opinion a good source to all those who want a step by step instructions to the process of writing. ""Excerpts from My Resume"" is a sister to ""My Resume"". It's written from my perspective as a mother, wife, sister, friend, employee, lover, enemy and human being.<div>I come from a family of 14 siblings and we lived on the south side of Chicago, to the suburbs of Illinois. Life was challenging as a young black girl from a large family in a poor neighborhood. My poetry talks about how I overcame and became the person I am today. <br/>My biggest challenge to date in this project is getting the funding I need to print my book. I have looked into grants and there really are not any for self publishing and loans are just out of the question.

</div></div>","Last year, the UK’s three largest literary festivals featured over 2000 authors. Of those 2000+ authors, only 4% were from Black Caribbean, Black African, South Asian or East Asian backgrounds. We’re aiming to change that.February 2016 sees the debut of Bare Lit: a literary festival focused entirely on writers of colour. Unlike
 other literary festivals which often confine non-white authors to 
one-off 'diversity' panels, Bare Lit Festival gives authors of colour the 
platform and visibility they deserve. We
 want to counteract the trend of equating literary merit with whiteness 
by highlighting the amazing variety of work currently being produced by 
BAME writers. That’s why we’ve put together an exciting programme of 
performances, panels and conversations -- such as ‘Second-Generation 
Poets in Exile’, ‘What Does Liberation in Literature Look Like?', (Re)writing Pasts and Futures' and 
much more. Find further information about the program on our events page here.This we hope will be the first year of many.But to make this happen, we need your help.To cover the costs of paying guests, booking venues, promotion and festival administration, we need to raise £7000.This
 will help us to provide a high-quality festival experience for 
attendees and affirm the importance of valuing writers of colour, both 
in the UK literary scene and as a whole.In the perks section you'll see we're offering the ""Complict No More"" e-book: “Complicit No More” is a collection of essays curated by Yasmin 
Gunaratnam. It tackles the crosscutting facets of complicity as they 
play out within our relationships to our bodies, each other, our 
communities, to media representations and to mobilisation. Limited edition Media Diversified tote bags: ...and festival tickets. As well as giving your support, we hope you can join us for what promises to be a groundbreaking cultural event!On Friday 26th February join us for our opening night launch party at the award winning Betsey Trotwood pub which will include live music from Peter Brathwaite, a poetry performance by Khairani Barokka and a DJ set by AKA Mama Junk. (Further Info)On Saturday we have a full day of events at both the Betsey Trotwood and the Free Word Centre in Farringdon, London  and on Sunday a full day of events at the Betsey Trotwood.

""It sneaks through my window at night, bright and clear.

<p>As
for distribution: We're currently in 365 or so locations across the region,
from Desert Hot Springs, through Palm Springs,

select locations in the Yucca
 Valley area. That’s
pretty darned good—but we can do better. We want to boost that number
of locations to around 400, and we want to do better at our existing locations. This effort will help us purchase new wire indoor
racks, and will allow us to refurbish, repair and perhaps replace some of our outdoor
distribution boxes.</p>
<p>The
vast majority of the funds we hope to raise will help us improve what we do
best—journalism. We want to increase our arts and events coverage, for example.
Right now, we’re doing a fine job of covering band/club/popular music and
reviewing multi-week theatrical performances; our visual arts coverage is also
among the valley’s best. However, many events outside of these categories have
tended to fall through the cracks, so we want to hire more writers on a
freelance basis to patch these figurative cracks.</p>

And human beings love human things: warmth, humor, and softer edges make the data go down smoother.<br/>Join me in this habit and have your work immortalized forever in a chapter dedicated to the powers of the underrated right brain.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The moment our doctor told us that we'd lost our daughter Priscilla at 20 weeks of pregnancy, I never thought we would see such light, hope and ultimately life come from her story. But we did! As I wrote the story of her life, her twin sister Tabitha's miraculous healing and all that Jesus taught us during our journey, I realized this story was not just for us. There was Truth hidden in those days between Priscilla's death and Tabitha's birth. This story will bring hope and healing to all those who have dealt with sorrows and help readers to recognize such miracles found in their own lives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When we were researching publishing options we learned that going a traditional publishing route gave away our rights to the distribution and publishing of this story. So, in order to make this book available to anyone and everyone who might benefit from it, we have decided to self publish. To get this book from manuscript to print we have several more steps to complete: Professional editing, cover design, copy and cover edits and purchase of ISBN rights. <strong>Now that we've reached our goals to </strong><b>cover these costs, we will use any additional contributions for publicity and reaching a larger audience once the book goes on sale. </b></p>
<p>This costs money! But we are opening up ways for you to help this book reach publication by providing a few really great ways for you to donate to this cause, and also give you a few extra perks when the book comes to print.</p>
<h3>Impact </h3>
<p>One of the mysteries of Jesus' death on the cross, is that He chose to die on a Friday and come back to life on a Sunday. A whole day between. And not just <i>any </i>day. It was a Sabbath day, and his followers were essentially force into sitting and waiting, unable to do anything to distract them from the loss of their Lord. </p>
<p>But we learned through our own experiences with Twin-to-Twin Transfusion back in 2012,  our own personal day between, that those days between Death and Life can hold the power to teach us and shape us and draw us to a closer relationship with Jesus. </p>
<p>This book goes into all the glorious details of our journey, telling of the lessons we learned, the miracles we witnessed and the people and events that shaped who we became. </p>

<h3><strong>SHIPPING</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Shipping will start in October!</strong> We ship worldwide with Post Switzerland, EU with Post France, Germany with DPD. We ship without Tracking, so the shipping rates can be lowered to a minimum. If a parcel gets lost, it's lost. Makes no difference if you have a tracking. If a book comes in damage and you take it, no insurance will pay this. So insurance makes no sense either. It's better to resend a book. Meanwhile we sent more than 1500 books in more than 30 countries and had only a loss of two books in Asia and one in the US. The packaging is very strong and the books are foiled and inside bubble wrapped.</p>

I wrote this book because I wanted to share stories from my adverse childhood as a source of inspiration and encouragement for my friends and family. That no matter what obstacle you face, you can achieve your goals. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own passion.</p><p>I want you to see this book as an opportunity to grow and become successful, escape from your comfort zone and learn alongside me as I strive for success. </p><p>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of adversity, entrepreneurship and passion. You will also uncover unique ways to grow your own diverse revenue stream:</p><p>* In my early childhood I came home from school to find that my home was gone. Our trailer had been repossessed and our short term normal was living in a garage.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>Finding My Twenty-Five reveals dynamic opportunities of living in your twenties and how to create new opportunities during any decade of our life.<br/><br/>My name is Wayne Beck and I am the author of Finding My Twenty-Five. I wrote this book to shine light on the benefits of living in your twenties and carrying on with those benefits throughout life. I also hope to encourage teens who want to get a jumpstart on accomplishing great things.<br/><br/>My hope is that in this book you will learn to break free of any shackles that may be holding you back from what you really want to accomplish or be, and at any age.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about finding freedom in your life from such stories as...<ul>
<li>How a career federal agent leaves his career to free child sex slaves throughout the world.</li>
<li>Four electrical engineering graduates rented a prune drying shed, then revolutionized the human resource management throughout Silicon Valley and the high-tech industry throughout the country.</li>
<li>A six-year-old rape victim reshaped her life through several tragedies. In her sixties, she became a television celebrity, one of the top twenty female authors of all time and she offered new hope to millions of fans.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to break free from anything that might be holding you back from the path you want to follow. You will be inspired by others to see clearly who you are more clearly and find that you are your own best teacher.<br/><br/>Finding My Twenty-Five is a non-fiction book that speaks to any twenty-something who wants to change the world, or anyone in their thirties, forties, fifties, sixties and beyond who wants to find the freedom to keep reaching new heights. With greater confidence, teens will find that they really can overcome anything and fulfill their dreams.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Finding My Twenty-Five</h3>
<p>Part 1, the Introduction and Chapters 1-4 describe the benefits of being a twenty-something, showing extraordinary resilience and capacity to impact the world. One example shows how a medical student founded a non-profit that funds diabetes research and then saved a family business, which ultimately is funding his education.<br/><br/>Part 2, Chapters 5-8 shows how people rise to the occasion to overcome great difficulties and continue on a productive path. You will see how a young boy overcame racial segregation, rose to become a Super Bowl champion, suffered many ups and downs and at age 69, was elected to the U.S. Congress.<br/><br/>Part 3, Chapters 9-13 demonstrate how key elements of the twenty-something’s advantages can come together to find pathways to success no matter what happens around them. Those primary elements teach the importance of applying mentors in your life. You will learn about a child who overcame health problems, then put aside his career path to join his brothers to save his dad's company when his dad's health began to fail. He also served as a mentor to his employees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>In Pennies From Jude (formerly Pennies from Montgomery),</i> Jen Carroll didn’t ask for her confusing life to become a nightmare, but when she seeks advice from a charismatic priest, he unwittingly sends her down a path that triggers chaos and the dark secrets surrounding the suicide of her childhood friend, Jude. </p>
<p><br/>My name is Keri Vornadore and I am the author of Pennies From Jude. I wrote this novel because I wanted to show how important it is for a young person to think for themselves, rather than blindly accepting the beliefs of others. Internalizing others’ perceptions of who we are, rather than questioning, can lead to mental health problems. This is <i>exactly</i> what Jen Carroll, the protagonist, does. She is distrustful of her own mind and she relies on external sources to tell her what to believe. </p>
<p><br/>I’ve read countless books on mental health, and what I have found is that the subconscious mind is critical in understanding how people tick. Did you know that 95% of your life is controlled by your subconscious beliefs, which form during childhood? What you take to be “true” on a subconscious level <i>becomes</i> true. That is why it's important to think for yourself, or else you could live your life on someone else's terms. Jen Carroll's outer life reflects the negative beliefs she formed as a child, but she re-defines them after hitting rock bottom. Failures are just opportunities to reconstruct ourselves. I know so because I wouldn't have written this incredible story if I hadn't!</p>
<p><br/>This book was inspired by my desire to blend self-help principles, such as thinking for yourself and forming empowering self-beliefs, into a compelling fictional story that can help <i>any person</i>. Although this book is fiction, it is based on substantial fact and real events that still affect people. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it is up to you to decide who you are and what you believe in. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental health in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover how influence and belief can be a catapult towards self-worth and success. </p>

But just before she declares revenge, Jude appears to her one last time to tell her something.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.

What you take to be “true” on a subconscious level becomes true. That is why it's important to think for yourself, or else you could live your life on someone else's terms. Jen Carroll's outer life reflects the negative beliefs she formed as a child, but she re-defines them after hitting rock bottom. Failures are just opportunities to reconstruct ourselves. I know so because I wouldn't have written this incredible story if I hadn't!
This book was inspired by my desire to blend self-help principles, such as thinking for yourself and forming empowering self-beliefs, into a compelling fictional story that can help any person. Although this book is fiction, it is based on substantial fact and real events that still affect people. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it is up to you to decide who you are and what you believe in. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental health in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover how influence and belief can be a catapult towards self-worth and success.

Like rebooting a computer with a new operating system, our society will function in fundamentally different ways.</p><p>Every major crisis gets a name: The Great Depression, The Great Recession, The Dot-Com Bust.

<li>Why Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, thinks the internet is broken and how we can think about fixing it.</li>
<li>What Vint Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet and Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, thinks tech creators need to take into account today that they did not in the past; and how the all-new framework of the <i>Four Quadrants of Unintended Consequences of Tech</i> can help you address Vint’s challenge.</li>
<li>Why the world is getting increasingly weird: If you imagine 2016 as a baseline for a very strange year, it's easy to see how it has just gotten stranger since then and we present how the little-known concept of the <i>Pacing Dilemma</i> explains this phenomenon.</li>
<li>How the long-running transition of a major share of the economy from analog to digital became dramatically accelerated, with shifts we expected might take 10 years happening in 10 weeks and how the simple economics of the Great Reboot can help you understand the timing of the changes and what comes next.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you are a founder or technology creator (or are interested in these worlds) and you deeply care about the broader impact of technology on society: no matter if you are in a startup or a big corporation.</p><p>There were many inspirations for this book, but an event on February 2, 2020 still sticks in my mind. On that day, I received a strange message from a business contact in China. We had a trip to Beijing scheduled 10 days later to discuss a business partnership, and our hosts sent an email of a couple of lines saying something to the effect of ""Do not come to Beijing now due to the coronavirus situation, and we urge you to reconsider your trip to Seoul."" South Korea was our stop before China. The dates all blur in our minds today, but on February 2, there were fewer than 200 reported COVID-19 cases confirmed in the world outside of China. The United States (the country with most cases at the time of this writing)<a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?yScale=log&amp;zoomToSelection=true&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;interval=total&amp;hideControls=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;country=USA~OWID_WRL~CHN&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> had fewer than 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases in total</a>, versus the millions it has today.</p><p>This event got me on the path of digging deep into the topic, and I started the Great Reboot Project, along with a website and early writing, in March 2020.

<li>Part 1 is about the <i>Three Waves of the Great Reboot</i> and <i>The Economics of Pandemics</i>, with a framework on how to think about the unfolding changes over time, and how to prepare for them. I preview some of these in<a href=""https://www.inc.com/author/arnobio-morelix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> my columns for <i>Inc. Magazine</i></a>, so you can check that out if you are curious.</li>
<li>Part 2 is about the <i>Circles of Impact </i>of the Great Reboot: in particular the macro context of what is happening in the circles of Home, Work, City, and World.</li>
<li>Finally, Part 3 is what we call the <i>New Operating System Toolkit</i>, focused on what you can do about all of this. The Toolkit is targeted to founders and technology creators — both people and companies — that want to navigate this new world in the most informed way possible.</li>
</ul><p>What we are creating here is a book that is different from anything else you might read on the topic for three key reasons:</p><p>First, it is at the intersection of technology, economics, and policy — my three professional areas. I work as an executive at Startup Genome, a Silicon Valley company, I’m a UC Berkeley-trained data scientist with a background in economics (studied in the University of Kansas, in the American Midwest), and in my professional history I have created research used by senators, governors, mayors, and the White House. I have worked directly with current and former government ministers as well as policymakers at the state and city level. You can read about each of these three areas separately, but they intersect in really important ways, especially in The Great Reboot.</p><p>Second, it brings a global perspective. As a native Brazilian living in the U.S. and working with organizations in every continent of the world, I am working here to tell this as the truly global story that it is.</p><p>Third, it is both long-term and action-oriented. The book is about how to navigate not only the changes that will happen in the next 1 to 2 years, but the next 1 to 2 decades. This is a point I want to make crystal clear: this is not a book about the pandemic. Rather, it is about the long shadow of The Great Reboot and its aftermath. In particular, it is about how to create technology responsibly in this new world.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need and What You'll Get</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598643245/cljp9z6tigytlfqw430x.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This campaign is an exciting experiment on how I can collaborate with all of you to produce a book that is full of stories, learnings, and actionable insights on how to navigate the world of The Great Reboot.</p><p>I am thrilled that this campaign will allow me to share early drafts and ideas with you and incorporate your thoughts and stories in the book.</p><p>Throughout my career, I have authored dozens of research papers and reports (usually hundreds of pages every year) with organizations like  <a href=""https://startupgenome.com/all-reports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Startup Genome</a> (where I proudly serve as Chief Innovation Officer), <a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/2018-latino-entrepreneurship-gap-report"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stanford University</a>, and the <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2078080"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kauffman Foundation </a>(a multi-billion dollar philanthropy focused on entrepreneurship).

Lubin Arora, a long-term collaborator, with consulting and research experience at places like Startup Genome, McKinsey & Company, and Bain & Company, working with me on research, writing, and management

Cass Lauer, my development editor with New Degree Press, who helped brainstorm many of the concepts that morphed into The Great Reboot

Natalie Bailey, my reviews editor with New Degree Press, working with me on the manuscript, including potentially new stories coming from this campaign

Jen Wichman, my acquiring editor with New Degree Press, helping me structure the manuscript and fill in the gaps still missing
I’d also like to acknowledge the huge list of talented people at New Degree Press who are working on marketing, video production, and other aspects of publishing.The Journey AheadThis book has been a tremendous learning journey for me so far. I have spoken with literally hundreds of leaders, in every continent of the world, about the general topic of the economy, technology, and the pandemic. But more specifically, even preceding the pandemic, I have done in-depth interviews with founders, executives, technology creators, and investors about how to think through the consequences of the technologies we create in society. These people currently or formerly work at places like Amazon, Facebook, Uber, billion-dollar startups, and top academic institutions.In the next several months, this learning journey is about to get even more interesting, and I hope you join me for it. I cannot wait to learn from your own experiences and share more of what I learn along the way.Thank you so much for all of your love and support.Abraços,Arnobio Risks and ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>We are super excited to announce the publication of our first book!</strong></p>
<p>Deborah Natelson’s book <i>Bargaining Power</i> is scheduled to be released on December 1st. However, pre-orders will be available starting November 1st. Pre-orders are a chance to get the book at a discount and to help the book come out of the publishing gate at a higher ranking on Amazon. </p>
<p>Here’s the back cover summary of the book and a peek at the front cover:</p>
<p>When she agreed to work for Carina’s greatest and strangest cryptanalyst, Mercedes didn’t realize she’d be playing cloak-and-dagger with aristocracy.  But once her boss uncovers a grotesque plot against King Emil II’s life, she doesn’t hesitate to dive into a world of deceit and trickery.  </p>
<p>Her plan might have worked, if the would-be assassins hadn’t had dark magic up their sleeves.  Soon, Mercedes has not only treacherous lords and ladies to deal with, but also both the beautiful, vicious personification Deals &amp; Bargains <i>and</i> a horrifying pair of weapons ready to devour the king, bones and all.</p>

<h3>What We Need to Publish</h3>
<p>Through our Indiegogo campaign, which will begin November 1st and end November 31st, we’ll be raising funds to print the books. We’ve sourced our printing through the printers we have researched that offer us the best bang for the buck. But, even so, copies of books still add up. Each book we print costs us about $5 for just the printing. Editing, proofreading, book design, and cover costs for each book add up to around $2,000. We plan on ordering about 500 books for our first run of printing. That means each book costs an initial $4,500. </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div><p>Sometimes I wonder why...why bother starting Thinklings Books or any company? It's such a hard endeavor! What'd we get ourselves into? We're small fish in a great big ocean. Heck, we're fish eggs right now. Caviar. … <i>Caviar.</i> High quality, costly, of great value. And trying to help other writers who are small but valuable too. That thought helps me just keep swimming.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1. Book Reviews</p>
<p>Honest reviews are super hard to come by, especially for first-time authors, but are one of the best ways to boost sales.<br/><br/>I know, also, that people get extra nervous about writing reviews. I’m sure it has something to do with those awful page-long book reports we had to do in school, but this isn’t going to be graded and doesn’t need to be nearly as long. You don’t even have to summarize the book; that’s what the book’s summary is for. Did you like the book because you liked how the main character talked? Say that. If you thought it was really good, but you were hoping for a certain ending and that didn’t happen? Write that.<br/><br/>Honest, short, to-the-point. <br/><br/>2. Share Their Social Media Posts<br/><br/>It’s hard for many writers to continually post about themselves. Writers mostly tend to be a quiet, self-deprecating lot. With our Platform in a Box, we teach them some types of simple posts they can make about their books, but it’s even more helpful if you can share these posts.<br/><br/>No need to add anything to it if you don’t want to. A simple share to page, or retweet, is fine. If you want to go the extra mile, like the Thinklings Books page on Facebook and share our posts about the author.<br/><br/>3. Book Launch Party<br/><br/>​If you are really up for some party planning and have that pizzazz, then working with a local library, bookstore, or other venue to plan a fabulous book signing / launch party is a wonderful gift for the writer in your life. If you have terrific party-planning skills but don’t know anything about book launches, just send an email to contact@thinklingsbooks.com. I’ll be more than willing to help you brainstorm.<br/><br/>Authors can, of course, plan their own party; but it does seem more legit to bookstores if someone else does it . . . even if you are just the person of contact, fill out the permission forms, and then disappear into the night. <br/><br/>Even if you aren’t the planning or form-filling type, you can still make sure that you show up for the book signings or launch party. Having a friendly face in the crowd makes even the most boisterous, confident author feel more at ease.<br/><br/>4. Low-Tech Sharing<br/><br/>Even if you don’t like computers, social media, or the internet, you can still talk up the book on the physical streets. Your author can give you bookmarks, posters, or flyers to put in schools, libraries, bookstores, or community centers. You can even use mankind’s oldest (and arguably greatest) technology: the spoken word. Tell your book club. Tell your mother. Tell your friend who likes to read.<br/><br/>Here are a few additional low-tech options:</p>
<p>-Put the book in one of those little free library boxes. </p>
<p>-Leave the book on a table in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>-Gift the book to readers in your life.</p>
<p>-Give the book, if applicable, to local school libraries.</p>
<p>-Form your own book club and use your author’s book as the first book.</p>
<p>-Leave a flyer wherever you see people reading books.</p>
<p><br/>5. Putting Books on Consignment at Bookstores<br/><br/>The author can, again, put their book on consignment at a local bookstore, but it looks better if someone else does this. Most local bookstores have a form you can fill out, and you can give them a couple of copies of the book. You can ask your author, or email us at contact@thinklingsbooks.com, for wholesale copies of the book to give to bookstores.<br/><br/>When the bookstores sell the book, they keep a certain amount of the profit and will hand the rest over to you. Usually these consignment contracts have a specific amount of time that they will have your book available. If the book doesn’t sell all of its copies before the end, you will need to come back and pick them up.<br/><br/>This is an especially good strategy if you are having a book signing at the local bookstore. Most of the copies will be sold right around the time of the book signing. If your author is well known in the community, you may be able to negotiate for a really good placement for the book. But, even if she is not well known, many local bookstores do have a special place for local authors to be displayed, and often quite prominently. <br/><br/>If you need help negotiating this area, shoot Thinklings Books an email, and we’ll be happy to help you out. We’re here to make everyone’s job easier.<br/><br/>6. Requesting at Libraries<br/><br/>Did you know that you can request books to be at your local library? Some libraries will have the book available after just one request. Others require a few more. On the other hand, libraries also have e-books for borrowing as well. You can check out the author’s book on your Kindle or other e-reader device through the library’s online catalog. This is an easy way for the library to offer a wide array of books without actually buying them. If enough people check out the e-book from the library, they may even decide to have a hard copy available as well.<br/><br/>You can just walk right up to the librarian and ask if they have your author’s book available. You don’t even need to let them know the author is a friend. Just see if they have it available. They will look it up and say one of 3 things: 1) Yes, we have it available. 2) We do not have the hard copy of it, but you can download it via the online catalog. 3) We do not have it available, but you can submit a request; here’s the form or the link to the form. <br/><br/>Easy peasy. <br/><br/>7. Writing Reviews on Goodreads<br/><br/>In addition to leaving reviews on Amazon, you can also use Goodreads, which is a social media platform for readers. You just need to follow the same advice I gave above for Amazon. In fact, you can leave the same review you left on Amazon.<br/><br/>8. Leaving Comments on Their Blog<br/><br/>As part of Platform in a Box, authors are given a simple website with a blog. They will once, maybe twice per month, write a post on the blog about their book, give an update on it or themselves, or on something related to their craft.<br/><br/>Checking in once in a while and leaving a simple, authentic comment such as “Can’t wait to see you at the book festival!” is great. Asking the author a question is also great. For example, “Who is your favorite author?”<br/><br/>9. Join The Readers’ Collective<br/><br/>The Readers’ Collective is Thinklings Books’ group of diehard fans and readers. We send out weekly updates on our authors, which will include yours; YouTube videos; artwork; blogs; important links and dates; podcasts; and much more. It’s the easiest way to keep abreast of Thinklings’ offerings and what is going on in your author’s life. <br/><br/>Being part of the Collective comes with quite a few perks, such as discounts on books, exclusive author interviews and artwork from their books, and sneak peeks at videos and recordings of their books. You never know what goodies might show up in your inbox!<br/><br/>It’s easy to sign up. Just follow this link and put in your email address and you’ll be all set. Make sure you check your spam folder so it doesn’t get junked before you see it.<br/><br/>10. Get Involved with Crowdfunding<br/><br/>Thinklings Books does publishing a little differently. We’re a small press, and we use a structure similar to PBS or NPR. We pay our authors higher royalties, to boot. To borrow from PBS: Without the financial support of readers like you, Thinklings wouldn’t exist. If you want to learn more about how Thinklings operates and is different, we did a <a href=""https://www.thinklingsbooks.com/blog/how-thinklings-does-it-differently-diversifying-income#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">three-part</a> <a href=""https://www.thinklingsbooks.com/blog/cutting-costs#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> <a href=""https://www.thinklingsbooks.com/blog/september-27th-2019#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">series</a> on the topic.<br/><br/>In addition to this page, we also have <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/join/thinklingsbooks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patreon</a>, which will allow people to support our writers and our creative endeavors on a monthly basis. Patreon might be something many of you have never heard of before, but I think it is super awesome! It’s a website that puts a modern spin on the age-old idea of patronage. Most great artists of the past, from Leonardo da Vinci to Mozart, had patrons. Most of the time, these patrons were extremely wealthy families with money to burn. However, Patreon makes patronage accessible to even the average Joe. With monthly patronage subscriptions as low as $1 per month, even high school students have the ability to support artists of their choice. Like patrons of old, Patreon subscribers get special bonuses from the artists beyond the reach of the general public. We’ll be reading our first chapters on video, providing exclusive artwork related to the books, and giving control of picking video critiques to our Patreon subscribers. Plus a lot more!</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi Everyone! Thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm Shiva - a writer, artist (<a href=""http://www.serpentinae.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.serpentinae.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.thepentaclepath.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thepentaclepath.com</a>), organizer, and satanist.</p>
<p>The mythology behind satanic ritual is immense. Stories of human sacrifice and barbaric acts abound and have been falsely constructed throughout the centuries as a means execute, imprison, and demonize people.  In modern times, we've seen the resurgence of this belief via the Satanic Panic of the late 20th century. In reality, modern satanic ritual practice couldn't be further from these tales.</p>

<p>The Devil's Tome is a book that explores non-theistic satanic ritual as a means for healing, empowerment, and community building.  I wanted to create the book I fantasized about finding when I first began my own journey into satanism - a stunningly beautiful work of art that would also serve as guide to help me understand modern satanic ritual and build my own practice.</p>
<p>I remember scouring old bookstores to find some gorgeously packaged mythical work to guide to inspire me as I began my journey into the occult, but nothing really fit the bill. The books I'm offering via this campaign are the realization of that fantasy. I'm creating a very limited first-edition printing of the illustrated ritual book that comes in two forms - a pearl linen cloth hardcover and a leather hardcover. Each will be stamped with gold foiling on the cover and include illustrations by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lex_corey_art/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lex Corey</a> and <a href=""http://luciengreaves.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lucien Greaves</a>.

<h3>What We Need</h3>

<h3>Stretch Goal Added!</h3>
<p>Thanks to your support I hit my initial funding goal within 13 hours! As we near the middle of the campaign, I'm adding a $20,000 Stretch Goal. Lucien Greaves and I are both lifelong musicians and have started collaborating on music and performance over the last few years. If the campaign raises $20,000 before the end of this campaign (October 31st) Lucien and I will send all backers a download of ritual music that we create to accompany this book!

About
Hi Everyone! Thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm Shiva - a writer, artist (www.serpentinae.com and www.thepentaclepath.com), organizer, and satanist.
The mythology behind satanic ritual is immense. Stories of human sacrifice and barbaric acts abound and have been falsely constructed throughout the centuries as a means execute, imprison, and demonize people.  In modern times, we've seen the resurgence of this belief via the Satanic Panic of the late 20th century. In reality, modern satanic ritual practice couldn't be further from these tales.

Over the years I've constructed rituals to use in my personal life as well as group rituals for The Satanic Temple Headquarters. I've explored the transformative nature of satanic ritual and witnessed it as a powerful force of good in my life and those who have used it to better themselves.

What We Need
I went back and forth with this decision to crowdfund or seek a publisher, but ultimately I wanted to retain as much creative control as possible (Satanist much?) and publish under my own company Serpentinae.

Stretch Goal Added!
Thanks to your support I hit my initial funding goal within 13 hours! As we near the middle of the campaign, I'm adding a $20,000 Stretch Goal.

In this book I explain how I died and went to heaven, who I met there, and what happened there that changed me forever.<br/><br/>My name is <strong>Carlos Vivas</strong> and I am the author of <i>A Dolphin Miracle</i>. I wrote this book because I felt the urgency to share my message with the world. I heard so many testimonials about how my story impacted people, that I realized I don’t want to die with this music inside my heart. It needs to be shared.<br/><br/>Five years ago I had an amazing near-death experience. A dolphin saved my life. Since then, many wonderful things have come into my life, from people to experiences. My life was changed that day.<br/><br/>Since then, many people have heard my story. They’ve contacted me and invited me to share my message. I started sharing my story in big churches, spiritual retreats, seminars, weddings, convention centers, hospitals, hospices, birthday parties, field trips, festivals, and camping trips. I was even invited to participate in podcasts on Instagram broadcasting live to large International Audiences.<br/><br/>After I did my presentations in so many places it was clear to me that my message had some kind of impact on peoples’ lives. In many cases, after I shared my message, the reactions were overwhelming to me. I felt goosebumps all over my body after seeing some people crying and some people just wanted to hug me. Those are the biggest reasons that moved me to write this book. I didn’t know how I was going to do it, but I meditated and prayed about it and I was determined to write my story.<br/><br/>I want to be clear, my message is not about me. It is about all of us - how we all came to this world to live a life with a purpose. I believe that every person is born with special talents and unique gifts that distinguish one from another. My hope is that you will love this book if you been trying to find your life purpose, looking for hope, or working to forgive people from your past.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>A Dolphin Miracle</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue. Here are some of the questions I hope readers will reflect on after reading my book:</p><ul>
<li>Are you happy with what you have done in your life, until today, or do you want to change something?</li>
<li>Did you know you can start right now changing your future with the actions you are taking?</li>
<li>Did you think that we came to this world with nothing and we will leave this world without nothing?</li>
<li>How many lives have you affected in a good way?</li>
<li>What is the legacy you are leaving behind for this world?</li>
<li>How many people have you fed, clothed, or given shelter?</li>
</ul><p>I believe discussing the meaning of life, your life purpose, your legacy, your happiness, forgiveness and much more will change us all for the better. I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</p><p><br/><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>

</ul><p>And much more!</p><p> </p><p><strong>About the Author</strong></p><p><strong>Carlos Vivas</strong> loves to help others, both at work and in his personal life. Carlos manages and interacts with over 150 employees everyday in his business and he treats all of his employees as his own family. He always listens and offers advice to anyone on his team who is having a problem. When he isn’t working, Carlos enjoys visiting hospitals, nursing homes and hospices to pray with children, adults and the elderly, anyone who is sick or suffering. Carlos suffered his own loss when his mother died of breast cancer. After that experience, he promised to help other families affected by the same disease. He is also passionate about suicide prevention, feeding the homeless, and helping the US Marine Corps collect and distribute teddy bears through their Toys for Tots program. Carlos is a true friend to many people and charitable causes.<br/><br/>Carlos wrote this book because he believes people are hungry for hope, love, and forgiveness. Carlos lives by the Golden Rule to treat others the way you want to be treated and his passion is to help others when he sees an opportunity to help. With this book, he hopes readers will realize how important it is to forgive the past and continue walking toward the future, His belief is that we all came into this world with a purpose and we need to fulfill that purpose. We need to create our own legacy, a blueprint, that helps transform the lives of others. He wants readers to take control of their own lives and, therefore, bring positive change into the world.<br/><br/>At 14, Carlos battled cancer and won. In 2015, he survived a near-death experience. These trials transformed his perception of life. He realized that human beings come into this world for such a brief time and that this is a time to learn lessons, to love, to laugh, to cry, to experiment and, ultimately, to experience everything life has to offer. This life is a gift.<br/><br/>In his spare time, Carlos loves to spend time in nature. He believes that when we are present in nature we experience Creation firsthand. He will often get in his car, hit the highway and drive for hours to discover new places. He loves to visit waterfalls, climb mountain and swim in the ocean. You can also find him spending time with good friends at music festivals, camping or sitting around a bonfire. He also competes in obstacle races, like the Spartan Race. Plus, Carlos is not just there for his friends, family and colleagues. He is also a friend to animals. He loves dogs and has had a pet Cocker Spaniel and Shih Tzu. He also had a green parrot as a pet. Finally, he absolutely loves Dolphins - the angels that came to his life to illuminate his world.<br/><br/>If you need more information you can reach me at helpfromheaven1@yahoo.com or on social media at</p><p>Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578915005639648/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578915005639648/</a>  </p><p>Instagram @adolphinmiracle  </p><p>Website <a href=""https://wwwadolphinmiraclecom.zyrosite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://wwwadolphinmiraclecom.zyrosite.com</a></p><p><strong>International Preorders</strong></p><p>For international preorders, please send me a private message.<br/> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

With this book, he hopes readers will realize how important it is to forgive the past and continue walking toward the future, His belief is that we all came into this world with a purpose and we need to fulfill that purpose. We need to create our own legacy, a blueprint, that helps transform the lives of others. He wants readers to take control of their own lives and, therefore, bring positive change into the world.At 14, Carlos battled cancer and won. In 2015, he survived a near-death experience. These trials transformed his perception of life. He realized that human beings come into this world for such a brief time and that this is a time to learn lessons, to love, to laugh, to cry, to experiment and, ultimately, to experience everything life has to offer. This life is a gift.In his spare time, Carlos loves to spend time in nature. He believes that when we are present in nature we experience Creation firsthand. He will often get in his car, hit the highway and drive for hours to discover new places. He loves to visit waterfalls, climb mountain and swim in the ocean. You can also find him spending time with good friends at music festivals, camping or sitting around a bonfire. He also competes in obstacle races, like the Spartan Race. Plus, Carlos is not just there for his friends, family and colleagues. He is also a friend to animals. He loves dogs and has had a pet Cocker Spaniel and Shih Tzu. He also had a green parrot as a pet. Finally, he absolutely loves Dolphins - the angels that came to his life to illuminate his world.If you need more information you can reach me at helpfromheaven1@yahoo.com or on social media atFacebook https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578915005639648/  Instagram @adolphinmiracle  Website https://wwwadolphinmiraclecom.zyrosite.comInternational PreordersFor international preorders, please send me a private message. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<p><strong>OUR IDEA</strong></p>
<p><br/>ProudBoy Magazine is about giving a voice to the voiceless - and we don't mean the fake victims on the left. ProudBoy, an online magazine formed by the Proud Boys of Gavin McInnes fame, will dedicate its digital pages to absolute and total freedom of speech, hilarious video content and some of the most offensive material you can think of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p><br/>1) We Are Libertarians</p>
<p><br/>Proud Boys, no matter their political affiliation recognize that the actions of the government should always be carefully limited and that as much responsibility as possible should rest with the people, not with the leaders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) We Venerate The Entrepreneur</p>
<p><br/>Proud Boys recognize that the pursuit of personal wealth is a noble pursuit, money is freedom after all. We are not necessarily greedy or selfish, but rather we recognize that the competition provided by a free market is the absolute best way to achieve innovation, better quality of life, and most importantly; the opportunity for any individual to succeed on their own merits rather than the whims of government or other meddlers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3) We Venerate The Housewife</p>
<p><br/>A woman has the ability to create another life in her body, this is miraculous, if she finds that her purpose in life is the raising of a good, strong family then that is a good thing, not a personal failing on her part. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>4) We Are Western Chauvinists</p>
<p><br/>Proud Boys look out at the world and at the state and history of it’s peoples, and recognize that, by every prevailing metric that demarks a great culture, the West is the Best. Western civilization, and by large extent American Civilization, has been the most successful culture in the world because of the fundamental principles of Liberty, Freedom, Meritocracy, and Reason. It is the first culture to be designed purposely for it’s own people with these values in mind and this fact makes it exceptional compared to all others. Proud Boys are unashamed of the culture that created them and resist encroachment on these liberties however they can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Listen, no one wants to go on the internet to talk their cause up and solicit strangers for support. The fact stands, however, that the only people in this world who can do nothing and still receive other people’s money are in the government, and our feelings for them should be clear at this point. If you like what we’re saying and what we’re about then please, anything that you can personally do to contribute would mean a lot. We need Proud Boys (and Proud Boys Girls) of all professions and backgrounds to help out with the day-to-day operations that come along with establishing a new media presence and we welcome everyone to join the discussion and see how and where they can contribute. That being said, there are also running costs associated with all of these things, and if you’re a scuba instructor or have a set of skills that doesn’t necessarily lend itself to digital media content, then monetary contributions to the cause will never be turned away. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I have reached my goal of $6000 to publish Rose's Locket! </p>
<p>I am keeping this campaign open for all the procrastinators, forgetful folk, or people just waiting on one more paycheck until Wednesday August 19 just to make sure that everybody who wants to pre-order has ample opportunity to do. It's been a heck of a year, and I just want to pass on a little grace, and I'm a procrastinator myself who thoroughly appreciates extended deadlines :)  </p>
<p>All the funds raised beyond my goal of $6000 will be donated to local teachers in my city, Denton, TX, and pay for the construction of a little free library on my property for my neighborhood and community to enjoy. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support and love! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My book, <i>Rose’s Locket</i>, is about an eighteen-year-old girl who receives startling new information about her adoption and must figure out how to deal with the remaining gaps. She goes on a journey to find answers and pens her own version of her family history along the way.<br/><br/>My name is Shannon Quist and I am the author of <i>Rose’s Locket</i>. I wrote this book because, like the main character Izzie, I spent a great deal of my teen years and beyond contemplating my identity and where I might belong in the world because of both known and unknown details of my adoption. I was adopted as a baby in the state of Texas through a Methodist mission home, but didn’t know the specific details about my adoption until I was much older and found documentation my parents had filed away.<br/><br/>After birthing my own daughter, going through a divorce, and being asked to help with a research project concerning the rhetoric around adoptions in Texas, I finally realized that it was time to look into this part of me and contemplate how being adopted has affected my life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the power you can stand to gain if you’re brave enough to create the self you want to be. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside Izzie the importance of what it means to take control of your life’s story, especially in the face of the unexpected and sometimes incomprehensible turns of life.<br/><br/><strong>The Story:</strong> On her eighteenth birthday, Izzie’s parents show her documents about her adoption she hasn’t seen before. With her boyfriend, a full tank of gas, a notebook, and a pen, she sets out on a journey to find her birthmother and the answers she feels will help her figure out who she is and where she belongs. As she grapples with what she finds, she turns inward to pen a fictional story to fill in the gaps of her own family narrative. The story that she writes is an attempt to reconcile the disappointment of seeking answers and not finding enough, but it’s also a joyful historical imagining of how stories pass down through generations. She begins with a baby named Rose and follows the winding and whimsical lives of these imagined ancestors.<br/><br/>You’ll love this book if you love the nostalgic tone of the late 2000s, winding summer road trips, magic unicorns, or stories about coming of age. Rose’s Locket speaks to young adults looking to define themselves and adopted people who want to grapple with the sometimes gaping lack of answers and existential thought in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Rose’s Locket inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who am I and how do I define myself?</li>
<li>How can adopted children find greater meaning in their relationships, both biological and adoptive?</li>
<li>With the trend towards more open adoptions, DNA tests, and instant gratification, how can we grapple with questions we still might never have the answers to?<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing our family histories can affect our trajectories, but will change us all for the better.</p>

<p><strong>THE BOOK</strong></p>
<p><i>For the Lives of All Women/Pela Vida das Mulheres</i> is a collection of photographs and interviews by Camila Cavalcante to be published by Break the Habit Press. For over two years Camila travelled around Brazil meeting women who have had, or who have been witnesses to, illegal abortions. She photographed a total of fifty women who, with their identities protected, shared their stories and intensified the debate for women’s reproductive rights. You can see some of Camila's images of this project <a href=""http://www.camilacavalcante.com/usforall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.<br/><br/>The title was inspired by the chant that people took to the streets to fight for women’s rights in Brazil and all over the world. It will be a bilingual book with the most powerful images of Cavalcante’s project, as well as interviews with the collaborators and essays from activists and experts.<br/><br/>In this book, Camila uses the naked female form to challenge the dangerous reproductive laws of Brazil. She exposes her body and her identity on behalf of these women in an act of dissent and solidarity for all, making her collection of portraits both deeply personal and deeply political.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<p>Access to safe abortion is a human rights issue and until this is resolved we will continue to fight for it. In Brazil abortion is only legal to save a woman’s life, in cases of a foetus without a brain and in cases of rape. Despite this law, one in five women between 14 and 40 years old have had at least one abortion in their life. If prosecuted, these women can go to prison for up to three years.</p>
<p>Similar laws affects 125 countries, nearly 40% of the world’s population. That includes Northern Ireland, where the legislation, as it stands, only allows abortion if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health.</p>
<p>The far-right is gaining power across the world and it is women and other vulnerable groups that will be affected most by this. We have to come together and fight for what we believe to be right. At a time in which fake news is on the rise and people are closing their minds to data and facts, we need to use all possible tools to create empathy and help break the stereotypes that are associated with women who seek abortions.</p>
<p>Within this context <i>For the Lives of All Women</i> is an act of rebellion in itself.</p>

<p><i>Us For All Women in 2017-4: “My choices were either to have a baby alone again while he would be a father when it’s convenient, because he was not ready to change his life style, or not to have a baby. But what I wanted was to have a baby with him.”</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>One year ago Camila created her first crowd-funding here on Indiegogo for her project Us For All Women/Nós Por Todas. It was an amazing way to fund her research and travels in Brazil and legitimise her work and activism while continuing to develop her art. Break the Habit Press and Camila now want to create this book as a legacy for the project and the cause.</p>
<p>Even though Us For All Women is artistically completed, creating a photography book is very expensive. All of the money raised will go to the cost of printing the book on high quality paper and making it the most beautiful book it can be. Break the Habit Press is a new start-up and so needs help funding this.</p>
<p>We need £4,500 to make a basic photography book. Any money over the target will go on making the book even better. If we have lots of extra money, this will go towards the book launch on March 8th, International Women’s Day 2019.

<h3>What is 'The Good Vibe'?</h3>
<p>I've been asking myself that question for three and a half years now. I actually recently made a full circle to that title as I've contemplated what name could embody this story.</p>
<p>My name is Levi Himes, I'm now 26 years old and living in Denver, Colorado. I grew up in Indiana and went to school in Illinois. Back in 2016 I graduated college, packed up my car, and started driving. I had a few destinations in mind, but for the most part I was making it up day by day.</p>
<p>I went all the way from Indiana to the Pacific Ocean, not directly, but that's where I ended up. I bounced around to national parks and friend's houses. I spent a lot of time thinking and a lot of days hiking. I was meeting new people and arguing with myself when I failed to embrace social opportunities. Either way I was growing for the better.</p>
<p>During that trip I wrote extensively about what I was up to, either in my blog online or in the journal that I kept with me. Since then I have combined the two, I've supplementing them with my memories and thoughts I have about that time traveling.</p>
<p>The story has reached a point where it is nearly ready to become an actual book. I am ready to put into motion the process of self publishing, which is what this campaign is all about. I need your help in getting me to the point where I can hand over this story to the public, and publish my first ever book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed to self-publish a book?</h3>
<p>I am planning to publish my book via a company called Book Baby. They are a facilitator of sorts for all the finalizing and preparation work that is needed to pull this whole thing together.</p>
<p>Below I have broken down my goals regarding what I financially need:</p>
<p>-*Professional Final Edit $700.00</p>
<p>-Self-Publishing Packages:</p>
<p>Complete $1790.00</p>
<p>**Deluxe $2290.00</p>
<p>-Bulk Book Printing:</p>
<p>***250 Books $1104.00</p>
<p>500 Books $1864.00</p>
<p>1000 Books $3289.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*The final edit will be the last review of my complete manuscript. Thus nothing else can happen until that edit is complete. Once it is done, I will review my manuscript and alter anything that I feel necessary. Once this step is done, I can proceed with formatting and printing.</p>
<p>**The deluxe self-publishing package contains all that the Complete package offers, but it also provides extensive marketing resources for my final book once it is published. Both packages include an initial printing of 25 soft cover books, the designing of a cover, the internal formatting (page/text design), opportunity for printing on demand, which lessens the future need for bulk printing of large quantities of the book, and finally two ISBN numbers which will be needed for soft/hard cover, and eBooks.</p>
<p>***I am aiming to print 250 initial books for distribution to sellers. I wanted to provide a price point for further bulk printing, depending on what financial goals I may or may not reach. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been writing for as long as I can remember, be it short stories I was mustering up in elementary school, or endless letters I was sending anyone and everyone in college. The idea of creative writing has always enthralled me, and now I have transitioned into a storytelling mindset. I travel and explore the farthest places I can find. I long to see the hard to reach destinations and to view the unseen. Thus I have a lot of stories about the places I have been. So this is my first big step in sharing some of these stories with the my friends, my family, and the general public.</p>
<p>Thank you for hearing me out, and taking the time to read through the details of what this whole campaign is about.</p>
<p>I am so excited to finally be at this point; turning my writings into a legitimate book. It has been a long time since I first considered turning my writings into a book, and so much time and effort has been put into turning this into something I believe is a story worth telling.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>

Thank you for hearing me out, and taking the time to read through the details of what this whole campaign is about.
I am so excited to finally be at this point; turning my writings into a legitimate book. It has been a long time since I first considered turning my writings into a book, and so much time and effort has been put into turning this into something I believe is a story worth telling.

<h3>Old Mother Frost</h3>
<p>Old Mother Frost is a children's Yuletide story based on tales of an ancient Norse goddess said to be older than Odin himself! She is older than the oldest Christmas story; and her role is to make sure children are happy, healthy and festive during the coldest and darkest time of year (the 12 days of Yule).<br/><br/>As a Canadian-born unto a Swedish heritage, my childhood was full of exciting tales and traditions from my Mom’s country. I grew up with different celebrations and holidays that were married into the western customs. For Christmas, I celebrated Yule for nearly an entire month, baked traditional Swedish treats, and took part in a couple Santa Lucia concerts; and I also had Christmas and Santa.<br/><br/>When I grew up I married a Canadian man from a German heritage, and together we had our Canadian-born son who we wish to raise with Swedish and German traditions.</p>
<p>Living in Canada, I found it difficult to find English books on tales we grew up with; and I wanted my son to know origins of Canadian traditions can be traced back to the areas his ancestors originated.</p>
<p>I decided to take matters into my own hands, and I began researching and writing my first children’s book, Old Mother Frost - a Yuletide story based on tales of a deity said to have inspired the stories of Santa Claus <i>(I leave all mention of Christmas and Santa out of the story).</i></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Background</h3><p></p>
<p>     Manipur is
one of eight states that make up India’s Northeast territories. Tethered to
mainland India by the narrow Siliguri Corridor, only between 21 to 40
kilometers wide, the Northeast region was not part of historical India. Manipur
was an independent kingdom able to trace its history to 33 A.D., and it shared
closer linguistic and cultural ties with its neighbors to the east.  Even after it was conquered by the British in
the nineteenth century, Manipur remained a separate administrative unit with
its own king and legal system. However, after a series of political maneuverings, in
1949, India forcibly annexed Manipur.</p>
<p>      When
Manipuri groups attempted to dispute the legality of the annexation agreement,
India responded by using brute military force to counter any aspirations for
independence.  Declaring Manipur and much
of the Northeast a “disturbed area,” the government used the Armed Forces Special
Powers Act (AFSPA) 
-- initially a colonial ordinance used by the British to suppress
Indian calls for self-rule -- to suppress Manipuri desires for the same.  The initial liberation struggle to restore
Manipur’s sovereign independence and the massive, and disproportionate,
counterinsurgency measures by the Indian government resulted in a state of
armed conflict that lasted decades.  </p>
<p>      The
insurgency was at its height in the 1980s and 90s, but has since been
effectively quashed.  For all intents and
purposes, the people of Manipur are integrated into the Indian political system.
 But even though much of Manipur’s
insurgency has been brought under control, Delhi continues to maintain
Manipur’s status as a troubled territory, and the Indian army remains in the
state.  Overt racism by the predominantly
Hindi-speaking speaking security forces goes unchecked.  Thousands of Manipuri people have been
murdered.  Yet more have been disappeared
while in state custody.  Rapes of Manipuri
women by Indian security forces have been all too common.</p><p></p><p>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/473561/files/20140331101436-indian_army_rape_hrw.jpg?1396286076"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote style=""text-align: left;""><i>(Human Rights Watch photo of women protesting the brutal rape and killing of Manaroma Devi.  On
11 July 2004, 32-year-old Manorama was arrested by members of the Assam Rifles,
a paramilitary force initially created by the British colonial government to
suppress dissent against British interests. 
The Rifles claimed that Manorama was a member of the separatist People’s
Liberation Army.   The next morning, some villagers discovered
her dead, bullet-ridden body in a field not far from her home. 
The
police surgeon and forensics specialist noted that the shots were fired at
close range and that Manorama would have been lying down when she was shot. She
was certainly not trying to escape, as claimed by the Rifles.  Her body bore a number of marks and bruises
indicating that Manorama had been tortured before she was killed.  Most troubling, a report from the Central
Forensic Science Laboratory found semen stains on Manorama’s skirt suggesting
that she may have been raped before her death. 
The rape could not be confirmed, however, because there were multiple
gunshot wounds in her vagina.)</i></blockquote><p></p>
<p><span class=""gmw_"">      Moreover, decades of military occupation and isolation have resulted in a severely distressed economy, an inadequate infrastructure, destabilized social norms, and weak public institutions.  Unemployment is significantly higher in Manipur than in the rest of India; hardest hit are those living in urban areas.  The state’s public educational system is severely underfunded and is one of the worst in India.  Teacher absentee rates in primary schools are at 24.8%.  Many Manipuris <span class=""gm_ gm_692911d5-799f-4fc2-17aa-8dfacb04a28f gm-spell"">have</span> expressed concerns that the public education system leaves young people unprepared to compete for jobs in mainland India.  Drug abuse is rampant: 42% of addicts are 15 years old or younger. </span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/473267/files/20140331081650-manipur5__1_of_1_.jpg?1396279010"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>      The
militarization of Manipur has had a deep effect on Manipuri society.  Afraid of being considered anti-national,
people in Manipur are afraid to speak freely. 
Harassment of businesspeople at Manipur’s many checkpoints has had a
chilling effect on economic growth.  The
racialized interactions between army officials who are predominantly from
mainland India and the people of Manipur have added to the distrust people have
for the central government.  The degree
of violence in Manipur has been astounding. 
And the Indian government’s unwillingness to acknowledge the extent of
army abuses is deeply troubling.  </p><p></p><p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/473576/files/20140331101956-manipur_-_outlook_india.jpg?1396286396"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote><i>(Photo from Outlook India)</i></blockquote><p></p>

2009, twelve-year-old Azad Khan was murdered. 
Security personnel dragged Azad from his home, shot him in a nearby

body to make it appear as if he was killed in an “encounter,” a euphemism used
throughout South Asia to describe instances in which the police, paramilitary
groups, or armed forces claim to have shot and killed suspected criminals and
terrorists in self-defense.  </p>
<p>     After years
of judicial inaction, the Supreme Court finally appointed an independent
commission to evaluate Azad’s case.  The
commission, noting that, “[i]t is extremely difficult to believe that nearly 20
trained security personnel equipped with sophisticated weapons...could not have
overpowered or disabled the victim,” found that the killing of Azad Khan was
unlawful.

isolated, travel can be expensive.  I am
asking for $7,500 to help cover travel expenses to and from the state as well
as travel within the state.  Money will
also go towards accommodations, and living expenses for the next few months for
me and for the photographers that I will be working with.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Everyone

Summary    
     I am a human rights lawyer from New York, who has spent the last year and a half working in India.  My previous project focused on the extra-judicial killings and disappearances of innocent civilians at the hands of the army and police personnel in India's high-conflict areas, including Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, and Assam.       During the course of my research, I had the good fortune of spending time in the northeast state of Manipur, where I met an extraordinary group of women: a collection of widows and mothers of people killed by the Indian army and paramilitary forces.  These women have suffered enormous losses.  Yet - and in the face of great economic, political, and social instability - these women are attempting to create small businesses, while providing each other and their children with a safe, emotionally supportive environment.  Some of their efforts fail. But some succeed.  I would love the opportunity to write about these efforts and share the stories of these wonderful women.  Any financial help you can provide towards this end will be much appreciated.

Manipur’s sovereign independence and the massive, and disproportionate,
counterinsurgency measures by the Indian government resulted in a state of
armed conflict that lasted decades.  
      The
insurgency was at its height in the 1980s and 90s, but has since been
effectively quashed.  For all intents and
purposes, the people of Manipur are integrated into the Indian political system.
 But even though much of Manipur’s
insurgency has been brought under control, Delhi continues to maintain
Manipur’s status as a troubled territory, and the Indian army remains in the
state.  Overt racism by the predominantly
Hindi-speaking speaking security forces goes unchecked.  Thousands of Manipuri people have been
murdered.  Yet more have been disappeared
while in state custody.  Rapes of Manipuri
women by Indian security forces have been all too common.            (Human Rights Watch photo of women protesting the brutal rape and killing of Manaroma Devi.  On
11 July 2004, 32-year-old Manorama was arrested by members of the Assam Rifles,
a paramilitary force initially created by the British colonial government to
suppress dissent against British interests. 
The Rifles claimed that Manorama was a member of the separatist People’s
Liberation Army.   The next morning, some villagers discovered
her dead, bullet-ridden body in a field not far from her home. 
The
police surgeon and forensics specialist noted that the shots were fired at
close range and that Manorama would have been lying down when she was shot. She
was certainly not trying to escape, as claimed by the Rifles.  Her body bore a number of marks and bruises
indicating that Manorama had been tortured before she was killed.  Most troubling, a report from the Central
Forensic Science Laboratory found semen stains on Manorama’s skirt suggesting
that she may have been raped before her death. 
The rape could not be confirmed, however, because there were multiple
gunshot wounds in her vagina.)
      Moreover, decades of military occupation and isolation have resulted in a severely distressed economy, an inadequate infrastructure, destabilized social norms, and weak public institutions.  Unemployment is significantly higher in Manipur than in the rest of India; hardest hit are those living in urban areas.  The state’s public educational system is severely underfunded and is one of the worst in India.  Teacher absentee rates in primary schools are at 24.8%.  Many Manipuris have expressed concerns that the public education system leaves young people unprepared to compete for jobs in mainland India.  Drug abuse is rampant: 42% of addicts are 15 years old or younger.       The
militarization of Manipur has had a deep effect on Manipuri society.  Afraid of being considered anti-national,
people in Manipur are afraid to speak freely. 
Harassment of businesspeople at Manipur’s many checkpoints has had a
chilling effect on economic growth.  The
racialized interactions between army officials who are predominantly from
mainland India and the people of Manipur have added to the distrust people have
for the central government.  The degree
of violence in Manipur has been astounding. 
And the Indian government’s unwillingness to acknowledge the extent of
army abuses is deeply troubling.            (Photo from Outlook India)
      On 4 March
2009, twelve-year-old Azad Khan was murdered. 
Security personnel dragged Azad from his home, shot him in a nearby
paddy field and then, according to multiple witnesses, planted a gun on Azad’s
body to make it appear as if he was killed in an “encounter,” a euphemism used
throughout South Asia to describe instances in which the police, paramilitary
groups, or armed forces claim to have shot and killed suspected criminals and
terrorists in self-defense.  
     After years
of judicial inaction, the Supreme Court finally appointed an independent
commission to evaluate Azad’s case.  The
commission, noting that, “[i]t is extremely difficult to believe that nearly 20
trained security personnel equipped with sophisticated weapons...could not have
overpowered or disabled the victim,” found that the killing of Azad Khan was
unlawful. Azad's case is still pending before the Supreme Court.            (photo from The Hindu)Vignettes        Over the next few months, I would like to travel to Manipur to interview families of people who were killed or disappeared by the army.  The widows and children of these individuals suffer not only emotionally from the loss of their loved ones, but they also face severe economic and cultural consequences as well.  In Manipur, some of the women have banded together in an attempt to start businesses and provide emotional support for each other.  They are surprisingly forthcoming about the successes and failures of their efforts.  I would like to start first by writing some journalistic pieces about their lives.  Some close (and well-connected) photojournalist friends have also expressed interest in collaborating with me if we can raise money for travel costs.  I have also been in touch with several documentary filmmakers, who are potentially interested in telling the stories of these women.      The articles I will write will feature the story of women like Leena (name changed for fund-raising purposes, but we will be using her actual name when her full story is written and published).  Leena’s husband was a drug addict, an altogether too common problem in Manipur where there are few jobs, and where the army profits enormously from drug trade with Burma.  Leena found out that her husband was killed on the news.  As a widow, she was harassed for not wearing appropriate mourning clothes, and for trying to find work to support her two minor children.  She receives no psychological or financial support from the government.  She told me, “my eldest son knows that his father is dead, but my younger son is just becoming aware. I worry he will become like other children who say that they will kill the person who killed their father. So many children of those that are killed become dropouts.”  Her hardships are many, but she is also extraordinary in her willingness to be more than her struggles. She works actively to support other widows.  And she has become a tireless advocate for the repeal of AFSPA (the Armed Forces Special Powers Act).
     Another woman whom I want to profile lost her 34-year-old son to an extrajudicial murder.  She had to watch as her unarmed son was shot, at point-blank-range by Manipur Police Commandos.  Officers then planted a gun and a bundle of money by the body, and claimed that he was killed in self-defense.  After years of litigation, the government finally acknowledged a few years ago that this was a fake, or staged encounter, (in other words, they acknowledged that evidence had been planted on the body), and they awarded the family 6 lakh rupees (about $9,500).  The family has not yet received the money.  The victim’s mother lives in a rural area, and despite speaking neither Hindi nor English, she manages to regularly travel and advocate on behalf of other mothers like her.How You Can Help
     I have been really fortunate to meet such extraordinary women in Manipur, and I really would love the opportunity to document and share their stories with a wider audience.  I am also working with human rights organizations in the state to use this work towards efforts to repeal the draconian laws that permit the army to act with such impunity.       Because Manipur is so
isolated, travel can be expensive.  I am
asking for $7,500 to help cover travel expenses to and from the state as well
as travel within the state.  Money will
also go towards accommodations, and living expenses for the next few months for
me and for the photographers that I will be working with.  Everyone
who contributes will be kept in the loop via blog posts and emails about our
progress.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

DRINK THIS IN (drinkthisin.com)
The ultimate resource on alcohol consumptionFitzgerald described it as “the rose colored glasses of life”, Shakespeare said it is where the truth “doth dwell”, and Sinatra said it “may be man's worst enemy”. What is alcohol really?The Book:Over half of the world’s adult population consumes alcoholic beverages, some much more than others. Most people know that drinking alcohol can make you tipsy, and drinking more can make you drunk. Those are simple observations but, like a complex cocktail, there is more to liquor than meets the eye, or lips. Alcohol’s influence is far-reaching and has frequently changed the course of history by shaping inventions, events, and lives. Drink This In is a comprehensive resource on the history, mechanics, influences, and economics of alcohol. The book doesn’t aim to promote or discourage drinking, it aims to provide unbiased information to readers. You also won’t have to study chemical biology to understand the book. Fictional characters help readers to relate to the information, and illustrations make it easier to understand. As the title suggests, we would like readers to Drink This In.Authors & Background:We, Chris and Luke Muller, are brothers and best friends. Having
both studied and worked in the field of economics, we are also seasoned writers
and researchers. Chris is currently working for an online education provider,
while Luke is a freelance economic writer/researcher. 
Together we have spent many years enjoying alcohol in a
social capacity. In late 2012 Chris asked himself, “how much do I actually know
about this substance?” The answer was “not much”. After some initial research
Chris discovered a lack of any comprehensive information available for the
general alcohol consumer. Luke’s interest was quickly piqued, and together we
started writing and researching. Drink This In was born. 
Now, 14 months later, we are preparing to publish the eBook
via self-publishing. We hope you are also thirsty for more knowledge, and can
help us through this final stage.

</div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>What Is The Other Side Of The Sun?</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The Other Side of the Sun</b> is a trilogy of books written by Thomas Alexander offering a unique
perspective through the eyes of a rural family on the impact of World War II on
ordinary Japanese life. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Inspired by the true story of a doctor from Northern Japan, it is one
family’s attempt to make sense of a changing world amidst the desolation of
history’s bloodiest war to date, both at home and abroad, as each person
chooses their own destiny and place in the new world. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Spanning the duration of the war with a story of love and loss and life
reclaimed, <b>The Other Side of the Sun</b>
series consists of three volumes: <b>A
Scattering of Orphans</b>, <b>The
Disingenuous Martyr</b>, and <b>Beyond the
Noonday Sun</b>.</p>

</div><div><b><br/></b></div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Why Does This Story Matter? </b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If recent world events have taught us anything it is that we haven’t
learnt from our history. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since the end of World War II there have been approximately 250 major
wars in the world, in which over 50 million people have been killed, tens of
millions made homeless, and countless more injured or left bereaved. In the history
of the world, the twentieth century stands out as the bloodiest and most brutal.
There is no part of the world that war hasn’t reached, and no people in the
world who haven’t suffered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We keep reliving our mistakes for one reason, and one reason only.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We forget that the other side is made up of ordinary people just like
you and me.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/743056/files/20140725051152-425770_10151161547046087_292514604_n.jpg?1406290312"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Understanding is the only way forward, and stories are how we reach
beyond ourselves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stories are the only way to move towards a world where we can celebrate
the fact that there are far more similarities between cultures to unite us than
differences to divide us. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stories of you and me and ordinary people scattered all over the world
matter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Far from glorifying war or taking sides over the conflict, <b>The Other Side of the Sun</b> trilogy takes
us into the story of an ordinary family caught within circumstances beyond
their control. We follow them through their intimate times of heartbreak and
joy, of new life entering the world, of death taking others out, and all those
moments in between that make us all human. It reminds us that there were never <i>“a million hearts beating as one”</i>, but
rather each heart struggling to find and follow its own truth. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are some stories that need to be told.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is one of them.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""></h4><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/757119/files/20140731111731-DSC_0759.JPG?1406830651"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Who Is Thomas Alexander? </b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thomas Alexander is a poet, playwright, and novelist who lived in Japan
for over ten years. During his time in Iwate he was told about the memoirs a
friend’s grandfather published about his experiences during the war. He was immediately
struck by the raw humanness of the story. Inspired, he began to write what
would eventually become <b>The Other Side
of the Sun</b> trilogy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While Thomas Alexander made a successful transition over the next ten
years into writing primarily for theatre, the novel he began so long ago in
Japan never let go of him. The characters and their lives kept drawing him
back, until he eventually had no choice but to sit down and finally complete
them. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of all, the disturbing events unfolding internationally confirmed
for him how vital it was that these stories be told. While 2015 will mark the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of the war in
the Pacific, he could see very little change in how we fundamentally view those
we believe to be unlike us. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It was this sense of urgency, coupled with the absolute belief that
stories can help bridge differences and build understanding, that pushed Thomas
Alexander to complete this trilogy for publication.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/742995/files/20140725042814-DSC_0400.jpg?1406287694"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thomas Alexander has had over a dozen plays produced on three continents,
in countries ranging from Japan to the United States to Afghanistan, with his
work translated into four different languages. Following several highly
successful writing and directorial seasons in Tokyo he was handpicked by the
Afghan government and commissioned to write <b>The Crossroads Country</b>, which he directed to international acclaim,
receiving extensive coverage from the likes of <b>CNN</b>, <b>NHK</b>, <b>The Yomiuri Shimbun</b>, and <b>The Boston Herald</b>. He is experienced in
all aspects of theatre, from opera to children's performances, having written
over twenty plays and directed more than ten.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>What Can I Do To Help?  </b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The costs of producing a book are endless, but even with all three books
in the trilogy written and raring to go there are multiple expenses – including
design, ISBN cataloguing, and editing – to consider. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We need at least $3,235 to ensure that Thomas Alexander’s <b>The Other Side of the Sun</b> trilogy is
published in full.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While we are aiming at a print run as early as September we still need
funds in order to help pay for publicity and proof copies so that we can get all
three books into stores as quickly as possible, coinciding with events
commemorating seventy years since the end of World War II.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/751299/files/20140729033746-INDIGOGO_TEXT3.jpg?1406630266"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 635px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The world changed for so many people that year, and we want to tell you
about just some of them.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>How Will The Money Be Used?</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The cost of producing a book is sizable, but the costliest – the written
word – is all but done! </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/751318/files/20140729034323-publishing-icon-banner.gif?1406630603"" src="""" style=""width: 564.16px; height: 82px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The funding we’re looking for not only ensures that these three books get published, it allows us make sure these stories get the exposure they deserve. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Without your help, the enormity of publishing a trilogy of this
magnitude over the course of a single year is at risk. With the 70<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the end of the war in the Pacific upon us, we believe that these
stories<i> need</i> to be heard.</p>

perks that ensure you get to be the first to read this trilogy for yourself! </p>

</div></div>","What Is The Other Side Of The Sun?
The Other Side of the Sun is a trilogy of books written by Thomas Alexander offering a unique
perspective through the eyes of a rural family on the impact of World War II on
ordinary Japanese life. 
Inspired by the true story of a doctor from Northern Japan, it is one
family’s attempt to make sense of a changing world amidst the desolation of
history’s bloodiest war to date, both at home and abroad, as each person
chooses their own destiny and place in the new world. 
Spanning the duration of the war with a story of love and loss and life
reclaimed, The Other Side of the Sun
series consists of three volumes: A
Scattering of Orphans, The
Disingenuous Martyr, and Beyond the
Noonday Sun.

Why Does This Story Matter? 
If recent world events have taught us anything it is that we haven’t
learnt from our history. 
Since the end of World War II there have been approximately 250 major
wars in the world, in which over 50 million people have been killed, tens of
millions made homeless, and countless more injured or left bereaved. In the history
of the world, the twentieth century stands out as the bloodiest and most brutal.
There is no part of the world that war hasn’t reached, and no people in the
world who haven’t suffered.
We keep reliving our mistakes for one reason, and one reason only.
We forget that the other side is made up of ordinary people just like
you and me.
Understanding is the only way forward, and stories are how we reach
beyond ourselves.
Stories are the only way to move towards a world where we can celebrate
the fact that there are far more similarities between cultures to unite us than
differences to divide us. 
Stories of you and me and ordinary people scattered all over the world
matter.
Far from glorifying war or taking sides over the conflict, The Other Side of the Sun trilogy takes
us into the story of an ordinary family caught within circumstances beyond
their control. We follow them through their intimate times of heartbreak and
joy, of new life entering the world, of death taking others out, and all those
moments in between that make us all human. It reminds us that there were never “a million hearts beating as one”, but
rather each heart struggling to find and follow its own truth. 
There are some stories that need to be told.
This is one of them.Who Is Thomas Alexander? 
Thomas Alexander is a poet, playwright, and novelist who lived in Japan
for over ten years. During his time in Iwate he was told about the memoirs a
friend’s grandfather published about his experiences during the war. He was immediately
struck by the raw humanness of the story. Inspired, he began to write what
would eventually become The Other Side
of the Sun trilogy.
While Thomas Alexander made a successful transition over the next ten
years into writing primarily for theatre, the novel he began so long ago in
Japan never let go of him. The characters and their lives kept drawing him
back, until he eventually had no choice but to sit down and finally complete
them. 
Most of all, the disturbing events unfolding internationally confirmed
for him how vital it was that these stories be told. While 2015 will mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the war in
the Pacific, he could see very little change in how we fundamentally view those
we believe to be unlike us. 
It was this sense of urgency, coupled with the absolute belief that
stories can help bridge differences and build understanding, that pushed Thomas
Alexander to complete this trilogy for publication.
Thomas Alexander has had over a dozen plays produced on three continents,
in countries ranging from Japan to the United States to Afghanistan, with his
work translated into four different languages. Following several highly
successful writing and directorial seasons in Tokyo he was handpicked by the
Afghan government and commissioned to write The Crossroads Country, which he directed to international acclaim,
receiving extensive coverage from the likes of CNN, NHK, The Yomiuri Shimbun, and The Boston Herald. He is experienced in
all aspects of theatre, from opera to children's performances, having written
over twenty plays and directed more than ten.

What Can I Do To Help?  
The costs of producing a book are endless, but even with all three books
in the trilogy written and raring to go there are multiple expenses – including
design, ISBN cataloguing, and editing – to consider. 
We need at least $3,235 to ensure that Thomas Alexander’s The Other Side of the Sun trilogy is
published in full.  
While we are aiming at a print run as early as September we still need
funds in order to help pay for publicity and proof copies so that we can get all
three books into stores as quickly as possible, coinciding with events
commemorating seventy years since the end of World War II.
The world changed for so many people that year, and we want to tell you
about just some of them.
How Will The Money Be Used?
The cost of producing a book is sizable, but the costliest – the written
word – is all but done!        
The funding we’re looking for not only ensures that these three books get published, it allows us make sure these stories get the exposure they deserve. 
Without your help, the enormity of publishing a trilogy of this
magnitude over the course of a single year is at risk. With the 70th
anniversary of the end of the war in the Pacific upon us, we believe that these
stories need to be heard.
In return for your generosity, we’ve put together a fantastic range of
perks that ensure you get to be the first to read this trilogy for yourself! 
We’ve broken down the production costs below, but these books – a labour
of love that have taken over ten years to write – need just that little bit
more help.
And that’s where you come in!
What Do I Get? 
This is the fun part! 
To say thank you for your help in making this possible we have a huge
variety of perks for you to choose from, but it all depends on what you want…

I don't anticipate that to happen though, but if it does, I will stop at nothing to ship out the books and prints for you who payed for it!    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute, you can still help me! You can tell your friends and family about my book and campaign, whether it's by word of mouth or through your social media accounts! I will appreciate your help just as much as someone who contributed money!

<p>Darkflame Books is the starting point for the publication of

writing my first novel <i>Lost &amp; Found</i>,
and it has expanded into a project that will be used to publish an ongoing
series.</p>
<p>From a young age, I always enjoyed reading and
storytelling.  I was the kid on the

<p>The goal is set at $1500 for several reasons.  The cost of filing for an LLC in the state of Texas alone is $400.  Promotion, cover art, and publishing itself take up the bulk of the rest of the costs.  I plan on including finished copies of the first novel as an incentive for supporting this project, and it will be less expensive to have them printed in bulk instead of individually.  It’s more cost-effective to have fifty copies printed than ten at a time.</p>
<p>I also plan to attend events to help promote <i>Lost &amp; Found</i> and its sequels.  Planning and travel costs can add up, especially if interacting with readers involves spending a night or two away from home.</p>
<p>Even if I don’t reach the entire goal, I hope to raise enough to at least file for the LLC and get a few copies printed.  Events may have to wait a little longer, but the most important parts of the project are sorting out the legalities of incorporation.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What is this?</span><br/></p> <p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Iulian, I'm a small-time writer of mostly journalistic content, with the odd dabble into fiction. I've never been published before, though I was once quoted as a source on Wikipedia, which people have constantly told me I should stop pointing out as an achievement. Over the past few years I have been trying to put together ideas for a book, a fiction novel with a simple manageable story.</p>
<p>That was about a decade ago. Over more iterations than I can remember, it has evolved into something less than simple, less amateurish, and approaching a status that I would consider to be at least half decent. Not only that, but during the writing process, it has grown from more that just one story and into a multitude of tales spanning worlds and characters abound, all tied together by a common thread. Yet none of these will be realized if I don't finish this one story.</p>
<p>Tale of Doom: Part One is my attempt to begin this journey. I'll probably have a flashier name for it later on. Part Two will also come along soon, depending on how well Part One is received. They were at one time meant to be one single Tale of Doom, but I decided to break it off in two parts, in the hopes that this way at least part of it will be out there, available for people to read. I repeatedly slapped myself to not turn it into a trilogy. So far this has worked.</p>
<p>It is a story of a character named Thorm. He used to be called Silverblade in an older version of the book, but that was a stupid name. Part One centres around an attempt, by him and several other characters, to basically save the world. Well, a world, it's got two moons and I'll probably give it a silly fantasy name. The catch is that he failed. And that's not much of a spoiler, Thorm dies about a page in. And unlike some other characters, he does not wake up in a mortuary, with amnesia. Instead, he spends what's left of time trying to explain to the embodiment of Death what exactly happened. </p>
<p>Talking about the book isn't probably going to do much, so you may as well read a draft of the first chapter, which is now posted in the Updates section.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why are you here?</h3> <p>Part One is almost finished, as writing goes. There is only one chapter left to write, which I had planned on finishing this summer, had being employed not kept me occupied. Not that I mind, having food to eat is a nice perk when writing. But that's just phase one. The book still needs several passes for consistency, a few details that need to be added once everything else is in, and the mother of it all, spell-checking, grammar checking, and all round ""does this make sense"" checking. English isn't my first or even second language, it borders on fourth, but it is the one I'm most comfortable to write this story with, so this part will be a doozy. That being said, that's not why I am here.</p>
<p>I am here because I want this to be a better book than just a text file. I want to add art to it, illustrations, an actual cover that's not made in MS Paint. A rough sketch, that I can do, but something that really catches the eye, that is beyond my ability, and people that do have the ability tend to value it. So that is where a portion of the budget intended for this book will go. The rest, well, there's the odd tax and maybe, just maybe, enough to take some time off work to really dedicate myself to this book and see it completed in its best form.</p>

<p><b>Q: Do they have noses?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes. And no, they don't use wands.</p>
<p><b>Q: Who is this book for?</b></p>
<p>A: Anybody that can read. There is a bit of violence in it and a lot of existential crisis, so maybe not for little kids.</p>
<p><b>Q: Your name sounds weird. Why don't you use a pseudonym?</b></p>
<p>A: Good idea, call me M.C. Sheppard. </p>
<p><b>Q: How long is the book?</b></p>
<p>A: Currently it is about 56.000 words long, without the last chapter or the add-ins. When it's finished, it should be at around 65.000 words. Part Two will be about the same size.</p>
<p><b>Q: Have you talked to any artists about those illustrations?</b></p>
<p>A: Not yet. I will once I have a clear idea of what the budget is, so I know just what I can shoot for. Ideally, the covers, and one illustration for each chapter and main character.

<p><b>Q: What happens if you don't get enough money for any illustrations?</b></p>
<p>A: They will be replaced with sketches, horrible sketches, like the one in the title of this page, and this sketch of the world Part One and Part Two take place in.</p>

A: They will be replaced with sketches, horrible sketches, like the one in the title of this page, and this sketch of the world Part One and Part Two take place in.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

White Pine Press has been publishing quality poetry and literature in translation for over forty years. We have published the work of Robert Bly for almost that long and are asking your help to raise funds to support the publication of Like The New Moon I Will Live My Life, a major collection of his work. 
Like The New Moon I Will Live My Life forms a companion to his recent Stealing Sugar from the Castile: New and Selected Poems. The Chinese-influenced strain of Bly's work is celebrated here and amply showcased in the over 170 poems. The collection is a kind of back road running parallel to the more traveled route of his Selected Poems.
I have worked with Robert and the poet Thomas R. Smith who contributes an insightful introduction, to rediscover a significant body of his work hidden in long out of print chapbooks, books, magazine issues, and in manuscripts. 
Robert Bly has long been recognized as one of the giants of Twentieth century poetry and thought. The Huffington Post says of him ""Robert Bly changed the course of American poetry by opening it up to the imagination and the deep-image aesthetic, he is dedicated to reintegrating poetry with life — daily life, the life of the body, spiritual and political life.""
Please join us in celebrating and supporting the publication of Robert's work in the new collection and spread the word to friends who enjoy his work.

<p></p>
<p>Lila Jean Vintage is a quarterly vintage fashion and nostalgia magazine, enriched by real stories. Through submissions from the public, Lila Jean retells social history through the lens of everyday stories. We go to the very heart of vintage – to the men and women who wore it first – and tell their story.</p>
<p>Lila Jean is made locally. The first three issues of the magazine were entirely self-funded by the magazine's founding editor Naomi Gall. We feel strongly about working with local businesses for print and design services and ensuring that every commissioned writer, photographer and illustrator are paid for their work. Your support will allow us to expand our list of contributors to get some fresh, new voices and artwork into the magazine which is why we need your help so that we can continue to support other independents just like us.</p>

<p>The campaign is to support the production of Issue four – The International Issue – due for release in September 2015. Work has already begun, with our content plan all set to go. Between the covers you can expect the best places to shop vintage overseas, a look at Qantas’s 95 years in the sky, an interview with Dita Von Teese ahead of her trip to Australia, a look at some lesser known historical attractions overseas, and fashion and beauty tips for the vintage traveller.

<p>For the last several years I have been publishing short stories on my blog and in e book. I have decided it is time to step it up and write a full length novel, Marked. You can read a sample of Marked<a href=""http://www.lisamccourthollar.com/p/marked.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here</a>.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $5,000 because I want to make sure that Marked is published correctly. I will be using the money for editing, formatting and cover art. I also want to step beyond e publishing and into print.</p>
<p>Then there is advertising and promotion, as well as a small cost of living. I would like to keep the electricity on while I write. :)  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help me reach my goal. One of the basic things in writing is editing. I have tried to wing it in the past, but that hasn't worked. I am dyslexic, so trying to self edit my own work is like the blind leading the blind.</p>

<p>So if you watched the video down below you will see what it is this entire planet has too do right now; Pulse LOVE. But to have the greatest effect<br/>with our hearts in relation to our Mother Earth we must have all of our<br/>greatest spiritual masters go to the chakra points on this planet and consciously pulse peace and love; acting like acupuncture needles for the<br/>earth. While I believe this alone can be enough, I’m not willing to stop<br/>here in ideas that need to be initiated. So the next thing that needs to<br/>happen is also going to be the hardest, yet, most gratifying. The world<br/>needs to put down the controllers of violent video games. And not because I believe video games makes people violent but because of what’s going<br/>through the gamers mind is. If you are playing a shooting game and the<br/>whole time you are thinking bang bang, oh shit I’m getting shot at for<br/>hours, those thoughts carry a low vibration. Next and most obvious one is<br/>also another hard one for many because they have a war within themselves<br/>and it reflects out to the world and so they think the war is out there but<br/>in reality it‘s a reflection of the war that is taking place within their minds. I was in the Marines, infantry at that, so I can speak for myself<br/>when I say that all the fighting I did did nothing but brought more misery, alienation and confusion to my life. There is no glory, honor, or courage<br/>in war, only illogical madness. Despite what the recruiting adds say. So I<br/>have this one question to all of our troops, to all of the terrorist, to<br/>all those freedom fighters; do you really have to fight? Let’s be honest<br/>with ourselves, the real reason we fight others is because we are afraid of facing the real enemy; FEAR. Which can be easily concord by going within<br/>our hearts and letting out our infinite light of love. If you think I’m<br/>saying this just because it sounds good think again. I was consumed by FEAR<br/>for years and it was eating me from the inside on out. I was saved by<br/>something that our western society demonizes. Maybe because this plant can challenge all the mainstreams programming in just five minutes. It’s Salvia Divinorum and with just one session with this sacred plant, it dissolved<br/>all my depression, alienation and showed me that there is indeed an<br/>afterlife. I could not believe that after being on this planet for the past<br/>28 years I had no idea there was a simple way of going into the spirit<br/>realm or that it existed at all. So if you haven’t tapped into the other<br/>side with Salvia or any other entheogen (psychedelics that are used to find<br/>the god within) to experience other realms, your higher self, or extra dimensional entities I suggest you look into it. But first educate<br/>yourself. Psychedelics are like any other tool. If one knows what one is<br/>doing, then they can be very useful. But if not used with the proper<br/>education, respect and intent then you increase the chances for negative results. After four years of experimentation I’ve learned that the best<br/>intent with the use of entheogens is to do the following.<br/><br/>First I revved up my heart chakra imagining the flow of energy going around<br/>my heart in a clockwise motion. While at the same time pulsing love to my heart. Then I turn on my chakras and aligned them<br/>for the big takeoff. My Love shield has now been put up. As I dust myself<br/>off with my quick takeoff as I circle the earth and solar system while<br/>pulsing love to them.

<p>Stewart Mosher experienced close calls with death in his youth, but it was his last four months in the Marine Corps Infantry (surrounded by the dead and dying in Port-au-Prince, 2004) that forced him to question life after death. Is there a God? Why is there so much suffering?</p>
<p>Out of the Marines, unknowingly a victim of PTSD, Stewart found the transition back into civilian life difficult. He found work, but could not find sufficient relief from his inner pain.</p>
<p>One day a coworker told him of a legal psychoactive plant called Salvia Divinorum. This information kicked off a four year quest of self-healing and exposed Stewart to a much broader view of reality using a variety of entheogenic substances.</p>
<p>Through these entheogenic journeys, Stewart found and explored many facets of a world beyond, a deeper sense of the basis for religion, and a new knowledge of what lay beyond death. Stewart travelled with interdimensional beings which  focused his visions, and opened his eyes to new revelations.</p>

</div></div>","So if you watched the video down below you will see what it is this entire planet has too do right now; Pulse LOVE. But to have the greatest effectwith our hearts in relation to our Mother Earth we must have all of ourgreatest spiritual masters go to the chakra points on this planet and consciously pulse peace and love; acting like acupuncture needles for theearth. While I believe this alone can be enough, I’m not willing to stophere in ideas that need to be initiated. So the next thing that needs tohappen is also going to be the hardest, yet, most gratifying. The worldneeds to put down the controllers of violent video games. And not because I believe video games makes people violent but because of what’s goingthrough the gamers mind is. If you are playing a shooting game and thewhole time you are thinking bang bang, oh shit I’m getting shot at forhours, those thoughts carry a low vibration. Next and most obvious one isalso another hard one for many because they have a war within themselvesand it reflects out to the world and so they think the war is out there butin reality it‘s a reflection of the war that is taking place within their minds. I was in the Marines, infantry at that, so I can speak for myselfwhen I say that all the fighting I did did nothing but brought more misery, alienation and confusion to my life. There is no glory, honor, or couragein war, only illogical madness. Despite what the recruiting adds say. So Ihave this one question to all of our troops, to all of the terrorist, toall those freedom fighters; do you really have to fight? Let’s be honestwith ourselves, the real reason we fight others is because we are afraid of facing the real enemy; FEAR. Which can be easily concord by going withinour hearts and letting out our infinite light of love. If you think I’msaying this just because it sounds good think again. I was consumed by FEARfor years and it was eating me from the inside on out. I was saved bysomething that our western society demonizes. Maybe because this plant can challenge all the mainstreams programming in just five minutes. It’s Salvia Divinorum and with just one session with this sacred plant, it dissolvedall my depression, alienation and showed me that there is indeed anafterlife. I could not believe that after being on this planet for the past28 years I had no idea there was a simple way of going into the spiritrealm or that it existed at all. So if you haven’t tapped into the otherside with Salvia or any other entheogen (psychedelics that are used to findthe god within) to experience other realms, your higher self, or extra dimensional entities I suggest you look into it. But first educateyourself. Psychedelics are like any other tool. If one knows what one isdoing, then they can be very useful. But if not used with the propereducation, respect and intent then you increase the chances for negative results. After four years of experimentation I’ve learned that the bestintent with the use of entheogens is to do the following.First I revved up my heart chakra imagining the flow of energy going aroundmy heart in a clockwise motion. While at the same time pulsing love to my heart. Then I turn on my chakras and aligned themfor the big takeoff. My Love shield has now been put up. As I dust myselfoff with my quick takeoff as I circle the earth and solar system whilepulsing love to them. After which I race to the sun pulsing all my love toit with the GPS turned on with the center of the galaxy as my nextdestination. As my spirit hit’s the suns surface I bounce off flying twiceas fast past solar systems that keep getting brighter with love. As I enter through the galaxies black hole of intense light I leave my ripple of love vibrating rainbows of light throughout the galaxy before departing thisgalaxy with the center of the Universe as my next destination. Flying even faster than before I see the galaxies streaking by while catching glimpsesof intelligent life roaring to my wonderful presence and acknowledging mycall for help. As I get closer to the center of the universe my spirit gets completely striped of it’s ego; losing it’s form, color and idea of it’s self. All that’s left is it’s truest essence; an energetic ball ofconscious light/love. Piercing the light, in the center of the universe, Iloss all sense of boundaries and enter into the universal consciousness.There I pulse my love out to the whole universal mind. Next I send out thecall to help rid the Earth of the negative influences. And once more I sendout another pulse of light love to all that are out there. Several minutesis all it took for this message to be received. And several minutes to getthe response in a high light loving way. As the energy intensifies, Istruggled to hold onto so much love in my aura’s cargo bay area. Once I wasas full as I could get, I jettison back to planet earth. The trip back took several minutes and as I enter the center of earth I explode love light inall directions, blowing away all the darkness from this world, leaving us glorious horizons to look forward too.You are NOW and ALWAYS Full of LIGHT, LOVE, PEACE and most importantlyFREEDOM from ANY and ALL inferior thoughts, energies and actions.

I'm Kathy Divine, a vegan author from Sydney, Australia and I'm
embarking on a vegucation revolution. </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>My
new book <i><b>Plant-Powered
Women</b></i>
is coming soon. This book is the perfect gift to give your friends
who are thinking about going vegan and would like to hear from some
of the most inspiring vegan women on the planet.</p>
<p>This campaign is designed for people who want to pre-order <i>Plant-Powered Women. </i> It is<b> not</b> a campaign to raise funds to publish the book. The book is finished and is in the final stages of publishing. We will post all book orders in late August/early September.<br/></p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to help people go vegan, not just by buying and reading copies of <i><b>Plant-Powered Women</b></i>, but also by using the money from book sales to translate my books into as many languages as possible and distributing these translated books for <b>free</b> in countries that don't yet have access to vegan books and have requested them.<br/></p>
<p>My
mission in life is to vegucate the planet. Through my four books
(<i>Forever
21, Vegans Are Cool, Plant-Powered Men </i>and<i>
Plant-Powered Women</i>)
I'm aiming to assist omnivore and carnivore humans who have not yet
heard about veganism, be inspired and excited about it and go vegan,
for life.</p>
<p>
By
buying a book or grabbing any of the other perks, you will be joining
this vegucation revolution and will be an integral part of making
this happen!</p>
<p>
So
that's the overall picture: the grand vision. </p>
<p>We
have already started work on the Vietnamese and Spanish translations
of my second book <i><b>Vegans
Are Cool</b></i>.
The first project is to veganise Vietnam through this book. The
Vietnamese people will be the first recipient of free vegan books.</p>
<p>By
buying one copy of <i><b>Plant-Powered
Women</b></i> ,
you will enable us to give away five books. It's pretty awesome! Not
to mention...vegantastic!</p>

I'm Kathy Divine, a vegan author from Sydney, Australia and I'm
embarking on a vegucation revolution. 

My
new book Plant-Powered
Women
is coming soon. This book is the perfect gift to give your friends
who are thinking about going vegan and would like to hear from some
of the most inspiring vegan women on the planet.
This campaign is designed for people who want to pre-order Plant-Powered Women.  It is not a campaign to raise funds to publish the book. The book is finished and is in the final stages of publishing. We will post all book orders in late August/early September.The purpose of this campaign is to help people go vegan, not just by buying and reading copies of Plant-Powered Women, but also by using the money from book sales to translate my books into as many languages as possible and distributing these translated books for free in countries that don't yet have access to vegan books and have requested them.
My
mission in life is to vegucate the planet. Through my four books
(Forever
21, Vegans Are Cool, Plant-Powered Men and
Plant-Powered Women)
I'm aiming to assist omnivore and carnivore humans who have not yet
heard about veganism, be inspired and excited about it and go vegan,
for life.

By
buying a book or grabbing any of the other perks, you will be joining
this vegucation revolution and will be an integral part of making
this happen!

So
that's the overall picture: the grand vision. 
We
have already started work on the Vietnamese and Spanish translations
of my second book Vegans
Are Cool.
The first project is to veganise Vietnam through this book. The
Vietnamese people will be the first recipient of free vegan books.
By
buying one copy of Plant-Powered
Women ,
you will enable us to give away five books. It's pretty awesome! Not
to mention...vegantastic!

<p></p></div>","Featured on:Yahoo article - An ex-stock broker travels around the world on $10 a dayTEDx talk - How to travel the world with almost no money?1000 Days of SpringHey guys!
My name is Tom (short for Tomislav), and I am
a travel writer from Croatia.
After almost five years of traveling on five different continents, I laid down in a hammock in one village on the coast of Ecuador, and started writing a book.I was determined to put down everything I know about traveling, and with that, answer the questions that many people ask me for years:
How is it possible to travel with almost no money?
Is my way of traveling safe enough?
What are the worst, and the best moments on the road?
How can you earn money while traveling?
Where to look for sponsors?
How do you parents and friends react?
Why am I traveling in the first place?
Since its impossible to give a simple and short answers to those questions, I started answering them in the only way possible - by telling my life story. In a way that is much detailed, comprehensive and intimate from the one that I shared with people via my FB page, blog and YT channel, for years.I wrote about my student days, about the days when I had a well paid job as a stockbroker, about going bankrupt, about turning my life around, about first ventures on the road with a backpack on my back, and about finding a way that I will follow in the years to come - by traveling.I wrote about hitchhiking in numerous countries, sleeping in homes of strangers, camping on the side of the road, eating in supermarkets and drinking beer in parks, volunteering, many anecdotes that I encountered on the road, natural beauties that left me breathless, and about the beautiful people that I met on the way.I wrote about love.Even though the plan was to write mostly about my last, biggest, and longest trip - 1000 Days of Summer, when I came to page hundred-and-something, I realized that I haven’t even started writing about that part of my life, that I have so much to say about everything that preceded it.And since spring precedes summer, and since all the events in the book took place (almost) in thousand days time, the book got its obvious title - 1000 Days of Spring.And the book is now, after four months of reminiscing, writing, erasing, editing - finally finished.Why am I writing all this, and why are you reading it?
The answer is very simple - I need your help.
Book is written, but for it to see the light
of the day - it needs editing, translating to English, printing. And since I decided that I want to self-publish the book, I need some money. Money that I, since I
traveled the world for years, lived my life to the fullest, gathered
experiences and wrote them down in my small black notebook - don’t have.
That’s where you jump in! Here, besides the
book itself (cheaper than it will be after the campaign) - you can get:
T-shirt that traveled with me everywhere,

cute leather bracelets from Kenya (with the purchase you directly help ""Little Home"" orphanage),beer in Zagreb,…and many more!
How can you be a part of it?The process is very simple: on the right side of the text find something that interests you, and with few clicks, via safe transaction of your credit/debit card, get some of the perks.Besides the fact you will get something for your money's worth, you will help me with financing the entire project, which depends

<h3>The Story of <i>The Unwavering</i>
</h3>
<p><i>The Unwavering </i>is a novel of short fiction stories focusing on the themes of humanness and reconciliation. It centers around how we reconcile in our relationships with others, and most importantly, with ourselves. There are a variety of stories focusing on different characters. In one story, it follows the travels of the wind as it traverses across the plains of the midwestern US, searching for towns to inhabit. In another story, a woman tries to remember the girl she once was, seeking to find a new way to live her life in the city of her dream. Another follows the journey of man with no home and a heart that’s seeking the sea.<br/><br/>I’m Lily Smith and I’m the writer of<i> The Unwavering. </i>I wrote this book because I am an artist. I discovered and then rediscovered my passion for writing several years ago when I realized I wanted to write and create with my writings. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I fully recognized the building passion inside me to write a novel.<br/><br/>This novel means so much to me. I originally started to write this book for my passion as an artist, but also for you. In this book, I aim to focus on human stories and the varying struggles that come with being a human in this world.

</div></div>","The Story of The Unwavering

The Unwavering is a novel of short fiction stories focusing on the themes of humanness and reconciliation. It centers around how we reconcile in our relationships with others, and most importantly, with ourselves. There are a variety of stories focusing on different characters. In one story, it follows the travels of the wind as it traverses across the plains of the midwestern US, searching for towns to inhabit. In another story, a woman tries to remember the girl she once was, seeking to find a new way to live her life in the city of her dream. Another follows the journey of man with no home and a heart that’s seeking the sea.I’m Lily Smith and I’m the writer of The Unwavering. I wrote this book because I am an artist. I discovered and then rediscovered my passion for writing several years ago when I realized I wanted to write and create with my writings. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I fully recognized the building passion inside me to write a novel.This novel means so much to me. I originally started to write this book for my passion as an artist, but also for you. In this book, I aim to focus on human stories and the varying struggles that come with being a human in this world. This book focuses on our shared humanity, but equally as essential, the different stories, lives, and relationships we lead.
You will love this book if you enjoy asking and finding the answers to questions that sometimes seem as if they have no answers. This book focuses on the different realities of our lives and questions that play into our moments of existence. If you enjoy diving into yourself and the seemingly unknown, this book will touch you.The Unwavering speaks to people, but especially students and younger adults who seek answers to questions we sometimes don’t know we’re asking.I hope that The Unwavering ignites reflection and introspection in you by pressing into essential questions like:

How do we reconcile in our relationships with others? Where do we fail to see where they end and we begin? How can we listen to the needs of others?
How do we lead our lives? Are we listening to the needs and wants that are not our own?
Where do we fail to reconcile with ourselves? What do we ignore in ourselves? Are we recognizing and honoring our individual stories and needs?

I’m really grateful for all of you and excited to be on this journey together as we seek to discover these questions and more.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Storytelling and the Music of Journalists.</i> This book explores how music journalists go through the process of researching, interviewing, and creating profiles and stories on the artists we love. This book includes an inside look at this profession along with personal anecdotes from these journalists and general advice for writers who want to improve their craft.<br/><br/>My name is Emma Djordjevic and I am the author of Storytelling and the Music of Journalists. I wrote this book because I’ve always loved music. It’s been something that’s been ever present in my life since I was young, and reading and learning about music was something that grew my passion as I got older. Through reading about musicians in magazines and online, I formed a curiosity about the journalists who cover this beat. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how music journalists convey the character of an artist from a snapshot of an interaction. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for music and writing in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you improve your writing and help you understand how to approach people when meeting them for the first time.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the different steps of creation and writing and the struggles that come along with covering music as a beat. </p>
<ul>
<li>My connection personal connection to music and writing. </li>
<li>A timeline of the story-writing process, from research and interviewing to editing and feedback. </li>

Accounts from journalists who’ve covered indie artists like Mitski, Japanese Breakfast, and object blue to world stars like Blink-182, Halsey, Billie Eilish, and BTS will be included to show the wide range of music as a beat. The importance of research, connecting with the artists, and the writing process will be explored through this part of the book.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-10 including the conclusion. This part includes some challenges that journalists face when interacting with artists as well as the problems that exist within the music and writing industries for women. Living in the age of #MeToo, targeted online harassment, and the conversation around visibility for different groups will be explored. A firsthand account of an inappropriate encounter with Alex Kane of The Last Shadow Puppets as well as the struggles with being a freelance writer will show the hidden problems of the industry.

    El impacto 
En
los últimos años las encuestadoras han presentado problemas de confiabilidad erosionando la democracia y el avance científico. Mi propuesta es hacer
una encuesta fidedigna y sin sesgos para tomar mejores decisiones a la hora de
votar.

Por nuestra democracia debemos generar un nuevo
tipo de información, más veraz y neutral.
Ahora
somos los ciudadanos los que debemos actuar y construir una encuesta cuyo
objetivo fundamental no sea desinformar sino entender verdaderamente cómo viene
la elección.
Además, la encuesta servirá para producir conocimiento científico, pues se trata de que los académicos participantes (tanto en el Consejo Técnico como los que realicen aportaciones), analicen los resultados y publiquen eventualmente artículos científicos.  Riesgos y desafíos  El mayor desafío es que la gente participe por la causa democrática. Sin embargo, en los últimos meses hemos visto a la sociedad movilizándose en todo el país, así que esperamos que esa concientización sirva de estímulo para apoyar este proyecto.
Para superar el reto, durante las semanas de recaudación haremos una campaña intensa entre la comunidad académica y la opinión pública en general.   Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar  Buscaremos algunos espacios de difusión pero lo más importante serán nuestras redes sociales, así que comparte el proyecto con tus amigos y seguidores.
Indiegogo también cuenta con herramientas para compartir el proyecto.

<h2>What is Kindle
Publishing? Why is it Important?</h2>
<p>  Kindle
Publishing is a proven system that gives anyone a shot at becoming a successful
author and publisher due to the publishing system and traffic that Amazon provides
to its products; given you have the skills to pull off writing and publishing a
book.  Given this, I’ve found much
success in the Kindle publishing system described in my video series and have shared
these methods to help many others spread their passion and stories worldwide.  It is also often considered fulfilling a life
goal when publishing a book containing ideals or stories that touch your heart
or you are passionate about.  Please
consider fulfilling my dream to help others spread their passions, dreams, and
stories through publishing. </p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p>
<h2><b>
The Kindle Publishing Playbook Series and Why I’m creating it</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>  The
Kindle Publishing Playbook video series is a complete, comprehensive guide
to teach anyone, regardless of previous writing 
experience, publishing experience,  computer experience, or income, how to publish
a book step-by-step, successfully.  A
common misconception when publishing books surrounds the opinion that you need
a publisher or a very complex pre-launch plan. Wrong! The Kindle Publishing
Playbook Series contains multiple videos that take the reader through an introduction
of the platform, creating the book, self-publishing it, marketing their books,
and much more. Creating this will allow me to spread my story and unique methods
to a large audience, allowing more individuals the opportunity to write and
publish books and achieve financial success. I’ve read over 8000 pages of
content, watched over 50 hours of video, listened to over 25 hours of audio and
more. Combining to over 7 months of hard work, I’ve spent the time developing
the ultimate strategy so that you don’t have to.  I’ve advised numerous men and women on how to
create, publish and market their books and in completing this project I will be
able to broaden my audience and help more individuals achieve this goal. Let’s dive
into exactly how I look to have people “check off” one of the world’s top goals
of “creating and publishing a book” from their bucket list and to-do lists. </p>

<h4>
<b>Part 1  -  </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">An Introduction
&amp; How You can become a publisher with no writing experience! </span>
</h4>
<p>In the first set of videos in this series, I will start off by
providing an overview and giving a brief explanation of the work that
publishing a book entails.  You may be
asking yourself, “Why Kindle?” which I cover in explicit detail to persuade my
readers to actually follow through with this successful residual income <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">powerhouse.  The history
of Kindle is discussed alongside a general overview of Amazon’s amazing </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">system, KDP Select. 
This system allows publishers to promote their book successfully, given
they have </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">prepared accordingly for Amazon’s promotion system to boost
their ranks and income in the long run.

Outsourcing work, Format and Structure, Cover.</span><br/></p>
<p>This second part of the video series will provide soon to be prosperous
publishers with a thorough guide on how to generate ideas in the field they are
passionate about or find suitable through the knowledge of analyzing market
research which is discussed in-depth in the video series.  Furthermore, customers will learn how to create
a catchy title on their content, outsourcing techniques if needed and much
more. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Additionally, the process of creating or outsourcing an
appealing book cover and in </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">what manner their book should be formatted to fit the
popular kindle device is delivered to the customers.</span></p>
<p>This series will be popular in that many individuals may or
may not have solidified ideas for books. Those who haven’t can start here in
the series!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>Part 3 - </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Publish Your
Book –  Pen Name/Author Central,
Description &amp; Publishing Your Book, Categories, Pricing, Reviews,
Sustaining Rank &amp; Maintaining Sales, Dos &amp; Dont’s</span>
</h4>
<p>In the third part of the series, I will cover a plan of
action over whether or not to use a pen name, and steps needed to boost their
name and obtain a fan base.</p>
<p>This part will allow individuals that already have a book
written to start here if they already have their book details covered.
Regardless, the step by step approach taken by following these videos allows for
ease when these upcoming publishers publish their book to the Kindle platform.</p>
<p>The action needed to write an attractive description , have
appropriate pricing, category placement and most importantly, popular keywords
will be covered in depth. </p>
<p>A common misconception is that you can publish your book and
let Amazon take care of the rest. This will not work; the post publishing phase
of this book describes methods of sustaining the rank and sales of a book and
giving the book proper maintenance.  Do’s
and Don’t’s are delivered based on not only my experience, but the experience
of many other established publishers.  A
compilation of essential resources will be provided to every customer in
addition.</p>
<h4>Part 4 –  <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Marketing Your Book – In Amazon Marketing,
Outside Marketing</span>
</h4>
<p>The secrets behind internal and external marketing during
the pre-publishing and post-publishing phases will be touched on greatly in a
simple, easy to implement strategy. </p>
<p>This is one of the most essential parts of the publishing
strategy!  From free and paid promotion,
to social media, blogs, backlinks, forums, article writing, email lists, press
releases, and more, this is an all encompassing guide that will impress even
the most experienced marketers.</p>
<h4>
<b>Part 5 - </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Advanced
Techniques</span>
</h4>
<p>The advanced techniques part of this video series is an all
encompassing guide containing over 20 methods that have helped my books
skyrocket in sales and exposure in past years. These techniques are extremely
unique to this book series and may have you saying “Why couldn’t I think of
that”? </p>
<p>This video series will be the prized possession of the series
and will be extremely popular throughout the UDemy platform (more on this later!).</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h4><b>Other Included Elements</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to what I will be covering in the parts above, I will be explaining the importance of evergreen content, how I stay organized, how to publish the actual book on the KDP platform and set up and email list, and much more. </p>
<p>Similarly, I will be including explanations of the anatomy of Amazon, how your book is found, and why marketing and social proof is important. I will touch on the future of publishing and provide a list of resources that details every URL explained in the video series. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lastly, the video series will contain a full five minute recap of the entire series, will contain
advanced checklists to help in publishing, and will contain any miscellaneous
information.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Why is this Video Series Unique?</b></h2>
<p>This is tremendously unique because
of the video series’ ability to teach publishers how to establish a symbiotic
relationship between themselves and Amazon while spreading books they are
passionate about.  No other series of
books on publishing or video series has rivaled my expertise on the subject.  I have an incredible amount of confidence in
my strategy and its ability to help other publishers become <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">successful.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And the
best part, this video series can teach anybody with no prior publishing experience! I’m
confident that I’ve put in more heart, sweat and tears than most in the
industry and I’d like to spread this knowledge throughout the world with your
help.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<h2><b>Where Are You Going to Sell the Video Series? </b></h2>
<p>I will become a premium instructor on UDemy.com and create a course on Kindle. I will charge around $100-$197 for the video series/course, and I will be providing many extras to customers. </p>
<p>Many of the existing Kindle courses can be very misleading, and do not provide what students really need to know. I'd like to combat that issue and create an extremely high quality course!</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>No aprendas de mí</strong> nos ofrece un relato fascinante acerca de las tribulaciones de un artista en uno momento muy complejo de nuestra historia más reciente.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En el año 1935, el protagonista, al ser reclutado para servir al ejército republicano, prometió lealtad a su bandera. Pasado menos de un año de esa promesa, acatando órdenes de los generales sublevados, se vio obligado a luchar contra el ejército al que perteneció y al que prometió lealtad. La sensibilidad artística de un músico como él, le sirvió para aislarse en el mundo que creó para sí, donde la norma fundamental del comportamiento era la no implicación, el no entrar en conflictos. Para ello, intentó alejarse de todos los acontecimientos que le sobrevenían, los desagradables e incluso los agradables que pudieran obligarle a contraer algún compromiso. Todo un universo ficticio construido para eludir sus propias fatalidades y problemas, y, de igual forma soportar las grandes tragedias que a diario se<br/>producían en la guerra civil.<br/>          Al aparecer en la novela un antagonista, también artista, en este caso pintor, se crea una nueva dualidad, porque coincidiendo en los aspectos fundamentales del porqué de la situación que les había tocado sobrellevar, lo diametral de sus temperamentos, hace que esa incipiente relación le haga descubrir al protagonista aspectos de la amistad que no conocía, y lo conducen a intentar salir del aislamiento que se había diseñado. Como consecuencia descubrirá entornos más agradables y placenteros. Para corregir esta deriva, tiene que enfrentarse y superar las distintas situaciones que le toca vivir y que le harán recomponer el resto de sus días.</p>

No por eso he dejado de tener un estrecho contacto con sus habitantes, familiares y amigos. Ahora he vuelto, espero que para siempre.<br/>          Hoy tengo el tiempo necesario para mostraros esta novela que siempre estuvo en mi particular «carpeta de proyectos». En ella intento mezclar al personajes central con otros conocidos y recordados, siempre situándolos en lugares y acontecimientos vividos por mí o tomados de los relatos e informaciones que me pasaron mis mayores. <br/>          A través de los años he descubierto que en la mayoría de los casos, la capacidad de aceptar o decidir define la personalidad del individuo.

Aquella noche, antes del toque de silencio, recostado en su litera leyendo una hoja rayada, llamó a Manuel: “Toma… comprueba todo lo que está ocurriendo… Toda esta tragedia, recogida en esta cuartilla, es el resultado del desinterés mostrado por nuestros gobernantes durante siglos, todo por la incultura, por los malos aprendizajes y la mala catalogación de los valores primordiales”. Subiendo el tono, casi en el umbral de la cólera: “Aquí tienes una lista con los muertos. Es el resultado de algo que no tengo capacidad para comprender. Todo debido a los extremismos de nuestros dirigentes”. Tras un largo silencio de ambos: “Tú desde tu pragmatismo, no te das cuenta que las capas populares, por miedo a las revoluciones y desordenes, están dispuestas a pagar con sus libertades”. Manuel quiso atemperarlo: “No es necesario que todos sepan cómo piensas, por favor, cálmate y baja el tono”.<br/>          “¡Que me calme!, ¿pero no lo ves?, todos, en esa frustración y desesperanza,  terminan perdiendo de vista algo tan fundamental, algo que incluso preconizaba Jesús de Nazaret, y que la propia iglesia católica no ha sido capaz de transmitir a todos sus fieles”. Ya casi gritando: ¡”Nosotros somos Vosotros”!<br/>          Todo el dormitorio se inundó de un prolongado murmullo. Entonces, oscilando la cabeza repetidas veces, y bajando el tono de su voz, a las repetidas instancias de Manuel, Romualdo sentenció: “Creo que no habrá solución si los seres humanos, no terminan viendo, que la única salida, pasa por comprendernos y fundamentalmente,  respetarnos.”Tras los susurros, el silencio de todos. Pasados unos segundos, Romualdo pontificó: “Pero los hombres seguiremos cayendo en las trampas de las ideologías y perdiendo las capacidades que otorga a otros la razón”. <br/>          Al final terminaban aceptando la situación y se sumía en un silencio monacal. Sin moverse, casi impertérrito, Manuel le invitaba a que procurase pasar lo más desapercibido posible, y que nada se le notase:”Piensa que el sueño de la razón produce monstruos.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Sports, Drugs and Rock N' Roll is a book for the average American who wants to understand different converging aspects of the Opioid Crisis in an interesting way without the typically used jargon. Written at the intersection of the Crisis, sports medicine and popular culture, this book will make a reader an informed member of their community and hopefully an advocate for bringing an end to this devastating issue.<br/><br/>My name is Drew Musgrave and I am the author of Sports, Drugs and Rock N' Roll. I wrote this book because the Opioid Crisis has greatly affected my home state of Ohio and I could no longer stand idle as more of my fellow Americans slipped through the cracks of flawed policies and into the unrelenting grip of dependence.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a few intricacies contributing to the multifaceted problem that is the Opioid Crisis as well as ways we can prevent them in the future. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for public health and the importance of primary prevention in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help in being an educated voter and active part in the health of your community.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about famous cases of opioid misuse and how we as a society can learn from those times when the system failed the individual:<ul>

</div></div>","Story of My BookSports, Drugs and Rock N' Roll is a book for the average American who wants to understand different converging aspects of the Opioid Crisis in an interesting way without the typically used jargon. Written at the intersection of the Crisis, sports medicine and popular culture, this book will make a reader an informed member of their community and hopefully an advocate for bringing an end to this devastating issue.My name is Drew Musgrave and I am the author of Sports, Drugs and Rock N' Roll. I wrote this book because the Opioid Crisis has greatly affected my home state of Ohio and I could no longer stand idle as more of my fellow Americans slipped through the cracks of flawed policies and into the unrelenting grip of dependence.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a few intricacies contributing to the multifaceted problem that is the Opioid Crisis as well as ways we can prevent them in the future. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for public health and the importance of primary prevention in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help in being an educated voter and active part in the health of your community.In this book, you'll learn about famous cases of opioid misuse and how we as a society can learn from those times when the system failed the individual:
Elvis Presley - Stigma around mental health can become dangerous
Purdue Pharma - OxyContin beginning of the Epidemic as we know it today
Drew Brees - Greatness can be achieved if pain is managed responsibly
Mac Miller - We still have a far way to go with preventative policy

<h3>Update 12/07/2011</h3>
<p>Many Thanks for helping us reach our published goal! My long term need is $2400, so if you planned on contributing or pre-ordering, you can still do it before the end of the campaign, as the funds will still be used exclusively for paying the illustrator on this project... Thanks again!.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I have been writing fiction for 25 years. Some good, some bad, some normal, some weird...For the past two years, I have actually felt comfortable enough to share it. </p>
<p>Also during this time, I have been lucky enough to be the father of four kids ranging from 16 down to 6. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The time has finally come for these two worlds to meet...</p>
<p>The result is my first children's book, a bedtime story about the source of children's energy. This book is short, easy to read to a child, and humorous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good thing- I could write it.</p>
<p>Bad Thing- I cannot draw.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So....I am raising money, or trying to, to help fund the illustrations that will accompany my text. Any extra money will be used in the publication process, either in upgraded paper, or marketing.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Energy Thief is a children's book. There will not be a significant cultural impact because of it's release... the seas will not part, plagues will not end and I cannot fix the economy because of your support.</p>
<p> What your support will allow me to do is complete this project the way I envision it- which will hopefully also provide a small amount of entertainment to you and your child at the end of a day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If it does not get fully funded through this indigogo campaign, I will simply keep pushing forward....but it sure would be great to do it right. </p>
<p>I will use whatever money IS raised to illustrate what I can, then perhaps reshape the book to fit those illustrations....Who knows, maybe I will draw some stick figures for the unfunded portion!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I plan on using the money to pay an illustrator to either embellish the ideas I have, or create a world to accompany the rhyming couplets I have created.

Martha awaits an upcoming procedure that may affect her memory, and she decides to write a book for herself to read afterwards. She chooses the year she first recovered, when she returned to college, so she can remember how to get better. Martha chases people through the past and future, through generations of her countries, looking for somebody who will stick. North for Sun is a story about playing in time, how families filter memory and how the experience of mental illness distorts and loosens time. It asks how we want to remember ourselves, what we would keep if we had to start over. At its heart, North for Sun is the story of how a good person got better again.</p><p>You learn more about my first book and read an excerpt on <a href=""http://mariedeaconubaylon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a>.</p><h3><strong>About my second book, Ligaya:</strong></h3><p>One day in the lives of nine people who cross paths with Ligaya, an extraordinary Filipino woman who has lived everywhere and met two million people.  Ligaya is a professional observer of human nature.  She has called most towns and many countries her home.  Now she lives in a city's heart: a bench at the liveliest intersection of Pine and Orchid Streets.  From her journeys, Ligaya has learned to judge people's characters in an instant. She can feel people's intentions, in the shapes of sensations, tastes, and sights.  The book starts with Ligaya's chapter.  Afterwards, each short story shows how her sensations grow in the lives of nine people, in one day, the same day.</p><p>My next book will be a collection of interrelated short stories, all set on the same day in the lives of ten different people. Each chapter or short story follows a different character as they go about their day. The stories connect because they are rooted in one person: Ligaya.  The stories are set in our world with magical elements woven into one day, in the lives of everyday, special characters.</p><p>Some central questions of the book: Every minute, we live near people we don't know. What happens to people who pass each other for this minute? What happened before this minute? What will happen afterwards? This book will explore what connects and divides people who could be closer but choose to live apart.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492829459/qjjbuwregsppgsvimjgr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Why I want to write this story:</strong></h3><p>People have more in common than we realize. I want this book to make people think about what we have in common. </p><ul>
<li>In my experience as a counselor, street outreach worker, and shelter worker, I've seen that everyone tries to survive. No matter their circumstances or choices, people try to meet what they need and want in life. And these needs and wants come from the same places: a drive for connection, emotional fulfillment, and safety. I want this book to look at the commonalities and differences among people with, at heart, the same desires. </li>
<li>One survival skill is judging whether to trust other people, who they are and how they can change other people for worse or better.  This real skill became the inspiration for Ligaya's magical empathy.  Ligaya has learned resilience from surviving her life.  She is deeply connected to herself and her community, which has brought out her capacity to relate viscerally with others.</li>

One day in the lives of nine people she meets.I am an independent writer fighting for a chance to write her second book!  This campaign will open for donations May 25 through July 24.   Thank you for hearing out my story...About my first novel, North for Sun:North for Sun is the book of Martha Marcelo, a Filipino-American woman with mental illness who can travel in time. Martha awaits an upcoming procedure that may affect her memory, and she decides to write a book for herself to read afterwards. She chooses the year she first recovered, when she returned to college, so she can remember how to get better. Martha chases people through the past and future, through generations of her countries, looking for somebody who will stick. North for Sun is a story about playing in time, how families filter memory and how the experience of mental illness distorts and loosens time. It asks how we want to remember ourselves, what we would keep if we had to start over. At its heart, North for Sun is the story of how a good person got better again.You learn more about my first book and read an excerpt on my website.About my second book, Ligaya:One day in the lives of nine people who cross paths with Ligaya, an extraordinary Filipino woman who has lived everywhere and met two million people.  Ligaya is a professional observer of human nature.  She has called most towns and many countries her home.  Now she lives in a city's heart: a bench at the liveliest intersection of Pine and Orchid Streets.  From her journeys, Ligaya has learned to judge people's characters in an instant. She can feel people's intentions, in the shapes of sensations, tastes, and sights.  The book starts with Ligaya's chapter.  Afterwards, each short story shows how her sensations grow in the lives of nine people, in one day, the same day.My next book will be a collection of interrelated short stories, all set on the same day in the lives of ten different people. Each chapter or short story follows a different character as they go about their day. The stories connect because they are rooted in one person: Ligaya.  The stories are set in our world with magical elements woven into one day, in the lives of everyday, special characters.Some central questions of the book: Every minute, we live near people we don't know. What happens to people who pass each other for this minute? What happened before this minute? What will happen afterwards? This book will explore what connects and divides people who could be closer but choose to live apart.Why I want to write this story:People have more in common than we realize. I want this book to make people think about what we have in common. 
In my experience as a counselor, street outreach worker, and shelter worker, I've seen that everyone tries to survive. No matter their circumstances or choices, people try to meet what they need and want in life. And these needs and wants come from the same places: a drive for connection, emotional fulfillment, and safety. I want this book to look at the commonalities and differences among people with, at heart, the same desires. 
One survival skill is judging whether to trust other people, who they are and how they can change other people for worse or better.  This real skill became the inspiration for Ligaya's magical empathy.  Ligaya has learned resilience from surviving her life.  She is deeply connected to herself and her community, which has brought out her capacity to relate viscerally with others.
I would love to read more stories about Filipino identity.  I think we need more stories about the whole spectrum of mental health, emotion, and imagination. 
My first novel, North for Sun, told the story of Martha Marcelo, a Filipino-American woman with mental illness who can travel in the time.  This new story plays with time and perspective in new ways that will challenge me as a writer. I would like to learn more about magical realism. I'm excited for all the problems and tangles that I'll have to tackle to tell this story!

</h3> <p>This is the third book in the Eden Kane series that began with <i>Sky Pirates of the Rio Grande</i> and continued in <i>Queen of the Sky Frontier</i>.  Now the epic story moves into high gear with this concluding chapter!</p>
<p><i>In 1867 Eden Kane left her job at the Smithsonian and headed West, intending to find the fabled Dark Aetheric Transmitter and become an agent of the government.  Instead, she became a leader to the Brethren of the Sky - the airship pirates who control the western frontier.  The following year, she faced her greatest danger as the former Confederate General Hood plotted to become the overlord of the west and destroy Washington D.C.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, with three of his superior air-warships at her command, Eden has become a power to be reckoned with, and as the forces of a weakened government and scheming robber barons converge on the frontier, she must find what course she intends to steer, and hold to it.  With her constant companions - the Experimental Zenobia Santiago and Diamondback Sally , Eden must try and carve out the destiny of the Brethren in the West - the Graveyard of Empires.</i><br/></p> <ul> <li>This is our 12th Adventurotica title produced by two award-winning authors.<br/>
</li> <li>We use the funding for these campaigns to live.</li> <li>You will help keep us alive and fed, and also contribute to the creation of awesome sexy adventure fiction.</li> </ul> <p>We are artists who live by what we do, and this is how we make our way.  It does not pay much, but it allows us to keep doing what we love.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What We Need:</h2> </div> <div>
<strong>Money.</strong> (No point in beating around the bush.) <br/>
<p>Here is how we will spend it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Materials for the incentives.</strong> All that fun stuff has to come from somewhere!</li>
<li>
<strong>Living expenses.</strong> Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, <em>the sun</em>. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. <em>Damn you, Maslow!</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medical care.</strong> Writing all these naughty words can 
be dangerous, you know. Paper cuts, repetitive stress injuries, tragic 
Hitachi accidents . . . it's a brutal line of work. (Have you ever tried
 to get lube out of a keyboard?) No, seriously, some of us need to be 
medicated for the public good.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us alive. 
Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary 
to what you might think, zombies don't write very interesting sex 
scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What Happens:</h2>
<p>We post the book serially on our site. This will be our 12th novel, 
and we've never failed to post three serial updates a week. We are 
reliable. The story <em>will</em> be finished on time. It is projected to run between 45 and 50 chapters, and should be between 125,000 and 150,000 words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Memberships to Adventurotica will be available for use immediately, 
meaning you can follow along there, three times a week, until the story 
ends.</li>
<li>If you've bought yourself any sort of walk-on role or bonus scene, that will obviously come out <em>with</em> the ebook.</li>
<li>The ebook won't come out until after the book has been published in 
serial form on Adventurotica.com. 
You'll be able to read it at Adventurotica the entire time.</li>
<li>Print books will be released as soon after the ebook as possible.</li>
<li>Production of material incentives will begin after the campaign ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't make goal, we'll still be able to provide the perks for 
everyone who did donate, and we'll do the best we can on what we get.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h2>The Impact:</h2>
<p>This is the part where we're supposed to explain how our project is 
valuable to you and to the world. No pressure. I'd love to claim that 
our project will bring about world peace by making sure nobody has a 
hand free to pull a trigger, but that seems unlikely.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What we can do is make people happy.</strong> Have a good time. Bring something that is unreservedly fun into the world, just because it belongs here.</li>
<li>
<strong>Erotica is an important genre, and we want to make it a better, more entertaining place.</strong>
 Bottom line, people often complain, with good reason, that good erotica
 is difficult to find. That most of it is poorly-written. That the 
characters are flat. That the sex is boring. That it doesn't tell an 
interesting story.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to give readers <em>entertainment for adults</em>, not just adult entertainment.</strong>
 There is a dire shortage of well-written, fast-paced, plot-heavy 
long-form erotica. We want to write a book that provides you, the 
reader, with a well-told adventure story that doesn't fade to black just
 when things are getting good.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to encourage independent erotica publishing by being part of it.</strong>
 By publishing independently, we are freeing ourselves from the 
restrictions placed on authors by publishers; restrictions on content, 
on length, on ratio of plot to sex. We aren't breaking rules. We're 
stepping outside of them. We're doing our own thing, our way. And you 
can help!</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><h2>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</h2>
<p><strong>Boost the signal!</strong> If you can't contribute, that's fine.  You can still tell everyone about us.</p>

 This is the third book in the Eden Kane series that began with Sky Pirates of the Rio Grande and continued in Queen of the Sky Frontier.  Now the epic story moves into high gear with this concluding chapter!
In 1867 Eden Kane left her job at the Smithsonian and headed West, intending to find the fabled Dark Aetheric Transmitter and become an agent of the government.  Instead, she became a leader to the Brethren of the Sky - the airship pirates who control the western frontier.  The following year, she faced her greatest danger as the former Confederate General Hood plotted to become the overlord of the west and destroy Washington D.C.
Now, with three of his superior air-warships at her command, Eden has become a power to be reckoned with, and as the forces of a weakened government and scheming robber barons converge on the frontier, she must find what course she intends to steer, and hold to it.  With her constant companions - the Experimental Zenobia Santiago and Diamondback Sally , Eden must try and carve out the destiny of the Brethren in the West - the Graveyard of Empires.  This is our 12th Adventurotica title produced by two award-winning authors.
 We use the funding for these campaigns to live. You will help keep us alive and fed, and also contribute to the creation of awesome sexy adventure fiction.  We are artists who live by what we do, and this is how we make our way.  It does not pay much, but it allows us to keep doing what we love.

What We Need:  
Money. (No point in beating around the bush.) 
Here is how we will spend it:


Materials for the incentives. All that fun stuff has to come from somewhere!

Living expenses. Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, the sun. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. Damn you, Maslow!


Medical care. Writing all these naughty words can 
be dangerous, you know. Paper cuts, repetitive stress injuries, tragic 
Hitachi accidents . . . it's a brutal line of work. (Have you ever tried
 to get lube out of a keyboard?) No, seriously, some of us need to be 
medicated for the public good.

And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us alive. 
Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary 
to what you might think, zombies don't write very interesting sex 
scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.

What Happens:
We post the book serially on our site. This will be our 12th novel, 
and we've never failed to post three serial updates a week. We are 
reliable. The story will be finished on time. It is projected to run between 45 and 50 chapters, and should be between 125,000 and 150,000 words.

Memberships to Adventurotica will be available for use immediately, 
meaning you can follow along there, three times a week, until the story 
ends.
If you've bought yourself any sort of walk-on role or bonus scene, that will obviously come out with the ebook.
The ebook won't come out until after the book has been published in 
serial form on Adventurotica.com. 
You'll be able to read it at Adventurotica the entire time.
Print books will be released as soon after the ebook as possible.
Production of material incentives will begin after the campaign ends.

If we don't make goal, we'll still be able to provide the perks for 
everyone who did donate, and we'll do the best we can on what we get.
   
The Impact:
This is the part where we're supposed to explain how our project is 
valuable to you and to the world. No pressure. I'd love to claim that 
our project will bring about world peace by making sure nobody has a 
hand free to pull a trigger, but that seems unlikely.


What we can do is make people happy. Have a good time. Bring something that is unreservedly fun into the world, just because it belongs here.

Erotica is an important genre, and we want to make it a better, more entertaining place.
 Bottom line, people often complain, with good reason, that good erotica
 is difficult to find. That most of it is poorly-written. That the 
characters are flat. That the sex is boring. That it doesn't tell an 
interesting story.

We want to give readers entertainment for adults, not just adult entertainment.
 There is a dire shortage of well-written, fast-paced, plot-heavy 
long-form erotica. We want to write a book that provides you, the 
reader, with a well-told adventure story that doesn't fade to black just
 when things are getting good.

We want to encourage independent erotica publishing by being part of it.
 By publishing independently, we are freeing ourselves from the 
restrictions placed on authors by publishers; restrictions on content, 
on length, on ratio of plot to sex. We aren't breaking rules. We're 
stepping outside of them. We're doing our own thing, our way. And you 
can help!
   
HOW YOU CAN HELP:
Boost the signal! If you can't contribute, that's fine.  You can still tell everyone about us.
There are share tools right here on Indiegogo!  Also, we are assuming
 you have some social network stuff going on, so spreading the word that
 way would be super-awesome of you.
We're sure you have friends who would appreciate some swashbuckling 
smuttery, so, really, you'll be doing them a service sending them our 
way.
We sincerely appreciate those who support us by helping to spread the
 word. Y'all do a lot of good, and we cannot thank you enough.",0.0,0,"17 Campaigns

<p>For those of you who don't know me, I'm Celeste. I'm a chef, an explorer, a storyteller, and a connoisseur. I've spent the last 4 years meandering about the globe and I am about to embark on a new journey. My time in New Zealand is coming to an end, but I've decided to take a final trip before heading state-side. After a sunny summer Christmas I'll head to Istanbul. From there I'll weave my way to the distant city of Marrakech, and exploring many places in between.</p>
<p>Thanks to the kindness of family, friends and strangers I'll be able to do this, and I couldn't be more excited! Traveling isn't always easy though, and often you have to find cheap ways of entertaining yourself. Winter travel can be particularly challenging since you can't wile away the afternoons on the beach or in a park. When I think of things I'd like to do for extended periods of time in small cafes and tiny train cars I imagined myself writing postcards. Penning letters to friends around the world.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
