Let's eat!
Hey! Are you hungry? We thought so... Earlier this year, we had an idea. What if we connected people who care about LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) equality across all 50 states, through a twist on the classic BLT (bacon, lettuce, tomato) sandwich? Veg friendly options, of course.




To launch our idea, we created a $150,000 crowdfunding campaign for BLgT USA - America's First 50 State Food Tour For Equality. Why? Because policy action needs a dinner date to change hearts and minds. Earlier this year, from MLK Jr. Day thru Presidents Day 2015, 660 people made the BLgT dream real. People from all over the country, and from as far away as Brazil, England, and Sweden chipped in. By the people, for the people!






PHOTO:  BLgT USA is amplifying organizations like The Attic Youth Center in Philadelphia, PA. The Attic provides career services, family counseling, and hot meals to youth - many of them in between housing, because they have been kicked out of their homes when they come out. Our partnership model provides visibility and funding for organizations like The Attic across the entire country. 
PHOTO: Supporters including Edie Windsor (DOMA Plaintiff), Top Chef Contestant Ash Fulk (Hill Country BBQ), Kris Perry + Sandy Stier (Prop 8 Plaintiffs), and Debra Messing (Actress) kicked in BLgT love from the beginning. 

   What We Need + What You Get. Yum.  
""Where did the first $150,000 go?"" Car Rental, Creative - Design / Website / Production, Fees/Payments Returned, Gas, Event Supplies, Housing, Insurance, Larger/Private Event Costs, Legal, Meals, Postage, Reward Expenses, Stipends
""Where is this $50,000 going?"" Event Supplies, Fees, Housing, Meals, Postage, Reward Expenses, Stipends

We need $50,000 to make the second half of the 50 state tour happen.

BLgT Supporter Rewards

The BLgT Impact


 You support = multiplier for impact, this summer and beyond. 
Our partnership model matches one restaurant with one LGBT organization per city. Proceeds from the BLgT go towards the community partner. 100% of this goes to local organizations. BLgT USA does not take a cut of this. We've already engaged over 1,000 people in-person across the country, created over 50 local partnerships, and captured 100+ stories that have been shared on our blog and in our weekly Huffington Post series. This summer is a win-win for everyone. This summer is about sparking relationships made to grow and last:


LGBT organizations gain visibility, funding, and access to new supporters.
Restaurants gain visibility, increased sales during our events, and access to new customers. 
Supporters get connected to organizations and local businesses they want to support.

<br/>(Shooting our first episode of ""Box of Crayons"", 50 Shades of Grey parody web series) (Adorable, yes?)<div><br/></div>
<div>I, Stacy, have been given the responsibility of telling a bit of our story in writing:</div>
<div>
<br/><p>It took time for Lara, David and I to work on a project together. I gave David a ""play"" of my poetry to direct once: a one-woman show. Nothing happened.  Two years later, I sent  David a message about ""Box of Crayons.""  I am sure he felt it would yield the same fruitless result when I told him it's subject: ""a 50 shades of grey parody."" Before that moment in time, it hadn't consciously occurred to me to be a filmmaker. How lucky was I that David was a filmmaker and had been filmmaking the second he got out of school?  David would bring one splendid thing to every single day of shooting regardless the challenge: love of film. That said, to David, he was in for a one day shoot of a book he knew very little about. Lara Clear was the glue. I told her something on the lines of ""I need you to help me, this won't happen if you don't."" There is a jump of a feeling when you produce your own work for the first time...what if it was just awful?   Lara Clear said ""yes"" in the best way a person can. She said yes and then she followed up...and then she found a location...and then she communicated...Lara Clear was very much responsible for the Box of Crayons ball rolling. And, I Stacy, needed it too. I have lived in the city for years just waiting for the perfect part to open up, the perfect person to find me, and something snapped within me: I would be waiting forever on a Beckett bench somewhere to no avail. No one knew, not even me that I'd reel them in to 7 more episodes. 7 more episodes means 7 more times of the following procedure: one month of saving up money and planning, one month of editing and then the episode drops! 8 times of fast pace film making; One episode shot in my air-conditionless apt on the hottest day of the year, and another episode took place on the streets and even highways of LIC.</p>
<p> Gradually, through intensive work together, something basic started to happen; my drafts got stronger, our editing room quips cleaner (David directs and edits in his own studio), Lara and I learned what we wanted on set, and, we all learned how to work together. Episode 1 debuted Valentines Day 2013 . Episode 8 debuted Valentines Day 2014 to this result: we were a new, unknown group and our video opened at 50,000 views and became funnyordie.com's most watched web series that month.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435720727/cyvctrwilv1x9wh1yvjq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Several months later, we came together again. Lara was traveling all over the world, modeling in England, auditioning in LA, David was working on documentaries and projects, I was finishing a rehearsal/run of a new show, so the fact we all converged again was  kismet.  I had written ""Peaches and Tea"" having been  frustrated with world politics, depressed about the role of women in society and enamored with period pieces like ""Sense and Sensibility."" David and Lara were on board with it immediately. And, then, it became producing in this beautifully smooth way.</p>
<p>This is what the room we shot in looked like:</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> A location and costumes were the first most difficult issues, but magically an affordable Inn (with the help of a locations producer, brought in by Lara) presented itself and the rest was a wonderful climax of dedicated, gifted professionals  working together for one foreseeable goal.  With limited funds, post was a rough road, but we: Clear, Price and Rey were able to submit to a few festivals. AND! ""Peaches and Tea"" was accepted into the 2015 Cannes Film Festival!</span><br/></p>
<p>So, we need YOU. Oh, we really need you to become part of our team. Help us submit Peaches and help us make more films!</p>
<p>So here's where every last bit of that money will go...</p>
<p>The amounts below added up exceed the $6000 goal. Here's why: wishful thinking! We will likely go in the red, but it's you that can allow us to simply do the work.</p>
<p>We would love to submit to more festivals!<br/><b><i>$1000 </i></b>dollars covers 12-20 additional festival entries</p>
<p>Festivals Fees range from free to 100 dollars. Most festivals fall in the middle mark at 40-75. The more prestigious festivals tend to be more expensive.<br/><b><i><br/></i></b></p>

</div></div>","Here's us now....Director David Rey at Cannes Film Festival 2015Actress and Producer Lara Clear at Cannes Film Festival 2015Actress/Writer/Producer Stacy Ayn Price on set of ""Peaches and Tea"" 2015
And here we are just 2 years ago!





(Shooting our first episode of ""Box of Crayons"", 50 Shades of Grey parody web series) (Adorable, yes?)
I, Stacy, have been given the responsibility of telling a bit of our story in writing:

It took time for Lara, David and I to work on a project together. I gave David a ""play"" of my poetry to direct once: a one-woman show. Nothing happened.  Two years later, I sent  David a message about ""Box of Crayons.""  I am sure he felt it would yield the same fruitless result when I told him it's subject: ""a 50 shades of grey parody."" Before that moment in time, it hadn't consciously occurred to me to be a filmmaker. How lucky was I that David was a filmmaker and had been filmmaking the second he got out of school?  David would bring one splendid thing to every single day of shooting regardless the challenge: love of film. That said, to David, he was in for a one day shoot of a book he knew very little about. Lara Clear was the glue. I told her something on the lines of ""I need you to help me, this won't happen if you don't."" There is a jump of a feeling when you produce your own work for the first time...what if it was just awful?   Lara Clear said ""yes"" in the best way a person can. She said yes and then she followed up...and then she found a location...and then she communicated...Lara Clear was very much responsible for the Box of Crayons ball rolling. And, I Stacy, needed it too. I have lived in the city for years just waiting for the perfect part to open up, the perfect person to find me, and something snapped within me: I would be waiting forever on a Beckett bench somewhere to no avail. No one knew, not even me that I'd reel them in to 7 more episodes. 7 more episodes means 7 more times of the following procedure: one month of saving up money and planning, one month of editing and then the episode drops! 8 times of fast pace film making; One episode shot in my air-conditionless apt on the hottest day of the year, and another episode took place on the streets and even highways of LIC.
 Gradually, through intensive work together, something basic started to happen; my drafts got stronger, our editing room quips cleaner (David directs and edits in his own studio), Lara and I learned what we wanted on set, and, we all learned how to work together. Episode 1 debuted Valentines Day 2013 . Episode 8 debuted Valentines Day 2014 to this result: we were a new, unknown group and our video opened at 50,000 views and became funnyordie.com's most watched web series that month.


Several months later, we came together again. Lara was traveling all over the world, modeling in England, auditioning in LA, David was working on documentaries and projects, I was finishing a rehearsal/run of a new show, so the fact we all converged again was  kismet.  I had written ""Peaches and Tea"" having been  frustrated with world politics, depressed about the role of women in society and enamored with period pieces like ""Sense and Sensibility."" David and Lara were on board with it immediately. And, then, it became producing in this beautifully smooth way.
This is what the room we shot in looked like:

(This photo is a photo of about 10 people you cannot see, although the dogs Einstein and Eddie try to do them justice. It took a village to make this shot happen)

""Peaches and Tea"" is the story of two female assassins who must decide on living arrangements.

 A location and costumes were the first most difficult issues, but magically an affordable Inn (with the help of a locations producer, brought in by Lara) presented itself and the rest was a wonderful climax of dedicated, gifted professionals  working together for one foreseeable goal.  With limited funds, post was a rough road, but we: Clear, Price and Rey were able to submit to a few festivals. AND! ""Peaches and Tea"" was accepted into the 2015 Cannes Film Festival!
So, we need YOU. Oh, we really need you to become part of our team. Help us submit Peaches and help us make more films!
So here's where every last bit of that money will go...
The amounts below added up exceed the $6000 goal. Here's why: wishful thinking! We will likely go in the red, but it's you that can allow us to simply do the work.
We would love to submit to more festivals!$1000 dollars covers 12-20 additional festival entries
Festivals Fees range from free to 100 dollars. Most festivals fall in the middle mark at 40-75. The more prestigious festivals tend to be more expensive.
$500-1000 Post
Post production can truly make or break a film.  This means color correction, sound mixing, music and special effects. Peaches and Tea could still use some work. The more work accomplished the more competitive the piece and  the more likely it is to do well.
Examples of Special Effects: We were able to get a location that was built in the 1850s but still,of course, had modern light switches, sensors, etc. To correct this, a special effects artist goes in and matches pieces of the houses' wall to areas where the light switches were. These corrections are daunting and must be done frame by fame. The fees can run production companies thousands of dollars. 5000 dollarsTwo new short films to be shot October and November 2015 for 2016 festival entries....This is ambitiously low, but fingers crossed!Here's where the money goes on a set:Sound/DP/Makeup/PA.........…1500+(per day)Equipment, Lighting/Rental.....1500(per day or weekend in the case of rentals)Location Rental..........................1000(per day, ideally)Travel.......................................…500(per day)(For Peaches and Tea, We drove a van with crew and equipment to the location from Union Square, NYC to the Hamptons)Costumes..................................500(For a period piece, rental for authenticity becomes especially important, one way to scale costs is to use educational sources and fantastic foundations like TDF, however costumes still can be one of the most expensive items on a limited budget.

<b>Summary and Conclusion/ Challenge:</b><br/>
</h4><p>Risks or challenges faced in doing this work pales to challenges faced by people in these videos. There are risks in asking people for money for any purpose but:</p><p>1. This is not a profit making venture.</p><p>2. I have been and will be involved financially in all of these projects.<br/></p><p>3. A portion of what is cleared from BBQ events this summer will be added to cash in hand for a second straight year so I am committed to this effort. Getting to the 80% of goal vicinity would be decent; 90% of goal reached and I am buying champagne (not from campaign funds); I am not even fond of the stuff!  <br/></p><p>ALL campaign funds are used to complete disk 3. The more we raise the more vets we record from dwindling numbers of WWII to Vietnam era service members from all branches and ranks. We have a series of gifts that we can offer for supporting  our efforts to preserve military history throughout South Western Pennsylvania.<br/></p><h4>Optional gifts for your support; <br/>

Videos areinformative, reverential; they say thanks all year long and they preserve the record.Example: Steve Jager's family arrived the USA Dec. 25th, 1928. During the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; Jager's guns were locked as pilots flew low enough to see    smiles. Alyce Massert worked on Japanese code as a Navy WAV; became a realtor     then had a Japanese man among her first clients. Massart and Jager died not long ago; all participants or loved ones receive the edited ""release video"" at no cost. Dorothy Rogers speaks of her war to get USMC sergeant's stripes and meeting  Elvis at Graceland while on duty in Tennessee on disk 1; plus Korean era experiences of twin brothers Leo and Leonard Kijowski on disk 1 & 2 respectively.Walter Kijowski; the last of six Kijowski brothers to leave Ford City for WWII or Korea will be recorded soon in Tarentum. Adrian Cronauer formerly of Penn Hills spoke of writing the screenplay for Good Morning Vietnam weeks before Robin Williams died for disk 2. Mr. Cronauer hit Saigon airwaves in 1965; helped start Pitt's radio station in the late 50's even appearing on Pittsburgh area TV as a child. After law school; Cronauer began his work on Korean era KIA issues for the Pentagon. A New Ken pilot completed his B-24 bombing run over Germany even refusing a morphine drip after being shot. Gilpin's William Shipman saw the death camps in the infantry; Harry his son went to Vietnam and daughter Jean was an Army nurse. Profit is not the goal; finishing the double DVD is.  All financial support no matter the amount will be valued and appreciated. Research, production, travel, materials and service costs must be met. Of the $8,250 budget self funding adds 3k; $600 from others plus promises totaling $150. There is $350 cash on 
hand as of August 4, 2015. Time spent on fundraising means less time recording frail, ill or old vets. As vets die with their story untold important things are forever lost .     What do we need to complete another DVD:
$5,000 is required to publish another DVD. Segments cost $750 each; we have 5 already to go but we need 7 more. Why me, what resources, experience and background?
We have two completed disks available now.

News/ corporate video & television studio production since 1999.
Capitol Hill:  sub committee coverage of  vet/ military affairs 1998 to 2001.         

Commercial radio; Pittsburgh, Orlando, Baltimore/ DC 1975 to 1998.
National Archives/ Library of Congress research 2008 to present.

Relationships with other 
documentary researchers & producers.



Summary and Conclusion/ Challenge:
Risks or challenges faced in doing this work pales to challenges faced by people in these videos. There are risks in asking people for money for any purpose but:1. This is not a profit making venture.2. I have been and will be involved financially in all of these projects.3. A portion of what is cleared from BBQ events this summer will be added to cash in hand for a second straight year so I am committed to this effort. Getting to the 80% of goal vicinity would be decent; 90% of goal reached and I am buying champagne (not from campaign funds); I am not even fond of the stuff!  ALL campaign funds are used to complete disk 3. The more we raise the more vets we record from dwindling numbers of WWII to Vietnam era service members from all branches and ranks. We have a series of gifts that we can offer for supporting  our efforts to preserve military history throughout South Western Pennsylvania.Optional gifts for your support; 
 Premiums include Honey Baked Ham gift cards, screen credit, posters. Our analog to digital gift is transfer of a single media type  to DVD. Send either silent 8 mm film, camcorder video, VHS/ audio tapes, pics, LPs or documents for archiving making them less vulnerable to total loss AND easier to enjoy. Our BBQ premium features BBQ with delivery in zip code 15068, fees apply  for delivery outside 15068. Orders are filled weekends in Sept. and Oct. To boost the power of your gift don't redeem your premium, this makes even more dollars available for production. But great food you don't have to cook during football season is tempting.

<h2><b>STORY</b></h2>
<div></div>
<p>The story is about Mica, a 19 year old girl, living in the outskirts of Los Angeles in the near future. She is home for the summer after her first year at college. She is in a transitory time, not knowing where she belongs or who she is. For most of the summer she hid in her room, addicted to her wearable computer contact-lenses or “Screens”.</p>
<p>The film starts on a late summer afternoon, Mica is lost in the virtual reality world of her Screens. As Mica attempts to hide in plain sight, a 22 year old stranger, Diana, interrupts Mica’s session. Diana reveals that she doesn’t wear Screens at all and Mica is somewhat embarrassed by her addiction to her Screens yet too stubborn to give them up. However, before Mica can hide again, she is visited by her imaginary friend, Sonic. He takes her back to a place in her mind, a place where she used to have full reign of her imagination, otherwise known as The Grove.</p>

<p>This is an ambitious project not only because of the story, but because we want to make this a high quality film. </p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We hope to apply all the knowledge we have learned while in college to the different areas of production and come out with a film that we are happy with and that is relevant and meaningful to our audience.</span></h2>

<br/>
<p><b>Corinne Marquardt</b>: is the writer&amp;director of The Grove. She was born in the Netherlands as an American expat and has moved around much of her life. She attended Pitzer College for her undergrad and  focused on documentary and experimental film. She went to Columbia College for graduate school and has focused on narrative films, while still incorporating documentary and experimental elements into her stories. Corinne has pursued filmmaking since a teenager, and is excited to finally create this original film, The Grove.</p>
<p><b>Carmen Garcia Davila </b>is not only the producer of this film, but she has helped produce every film with Corinne while at Columbia College. She is originally from Mexico, but she also speaks a handful of other languages such as Russian and Chinese. She studied producing while at Columbia College Chicago, but she is also knowledgeable about lighting, production design, cinematography and writing. Carmen and Corinne started working on this film in October 2014, and she has been a hardworking, resourceful and amazing partner! </p>
<p><b>Kia Herman </b>is a Production Designer and Costume Designer based in Los Angeles. She does film and commercials of all kinds, but her favorite genres are Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Post Apocalypse. She is well known for her work in the Award Winning webseries Player Piano, and she is very excited to be working on The Grove. She has a great positive energy, and her Production Design style is very in synch with the film´s visuals.</p>
<p><b>Tyler Bailey: </b>graduated from Columbia College Chicago 2014 with emphasis on Cinematography. He has worked in almost every facet of production but has found his calling behind the lens of the camera. Every last detail of the picture is paid special attention with composition, lighting, movement and how that aesthetically helps tell each unique story. Tyler is excited to visit the West Coast for the first time in his life and what a better way than to partake in something he loves the most; filming and storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Alexis Garcia:  </b>Despite her lifelong passion for film, Alexis first stepped on a professional set at 18, working as an extra for an NBC pilot. After two years working as an background actor, she finally changed her Marketing major and transferred to Columbia College Chicago to study behind the scenes work in film producing: the perfect mix between art and business. While at Columbia, she worked on numerous short films as a producer, line producer, and 2nd assistant director. In her final semester, she packed up everything and moved to Los Angeles to pursue her career in producing. Currently she's working as a production coordinator for AwesomenessTV and beginning an internship with Fandango in June.</p>
<p><b>Marco Roman </b>studied at Cal State Northridge, in CTVA, with the option in Television Production. Along the way he found his passion to help out his community, and decided to Double Major in Central American Studies. Marco is currently working on multiple projects which include, the Latino Heritage Organization, who are partnered with NBC Universal, to bring awareness of the Latino Culture in Los Angeles through a PSA.  He will continue to work hard and accomplish his future goals. </p>
<p><b>Ernesto Sin Alos</b> is our storyboard artist, and currently lives in Mexico. He attended school in New Jersey and has been creating comic books, storyboards and concept art for numerous student and  independent films. Despite our distance, we’ve corresponded via phone/email/social media to bring to life the vision of the script. He has been so incredibly responsive and practically telepathic in creating the concept art for the film. We can’t be happier to have him part of this team.</p>
<p><b>Timothy Steinman</b>: is the composer for this film. He was born in Evanston, Illinois and has attended school in Toronto and Chicago. While being the manager of a recording studio, he also works on his own experimental photography and sound art. Currently he’s writing the score for another film of Corinne's, and they've collaborated on other projects, such as music videos for his solo band, Arc of the Hunter. We are really excited to have him part of this crew, because we believe his music will bring a unique and complex layer to this film.</p>

<h3>What We Have &amp; What We Still Need</h3>
<div>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Through your donation, you are either buying a crew member a meal, paying for the shipping of the camera from Chicago to LA,  adding another scene of fantastic special effects to our film,  or helping bring another crew member to set.</span></h2>
<p>Your donation is extremely important to us! We will make the best of every cent we receive, and we will not only be grateful but will have the commitment to make this film the best it can be with the money you have generously given us.</p>
<p><b>Locations! </b>So far we have locked down all of our locations. What does this mean? It means that we have scouted and found the perfect locations for this film to take place in. We will be renting a house for a few days, but the rest of our locations are  public parks and exterior locations, from the Los Angeles River to a hiking trail in Pasadena. Although most of these locations don´t have a set price, the film commission here in LA requires us to purchase the permits to allow us to film in parks and public spaces.</p>
<p><b>Insurance! </b>The number one priority in any film project should be the safety of its crew members, as well as the safety of its locations and equipment. In this case, we are required to cover all of our equipment with additional insurance since we are shooting outside of Chicago, and to guarantee our locations that they will be covered against any alteration to their property. That is the reason why insurance is a  portion of the budget and it is really important and we would not be able to move forward without it.</p>
<p><b>Food! </b>Our hard working crew can´t work 12 hour days without it´s well deserved meals. In any film project of any size, meals will always be one of the basic expenses. In addition to meals, we spend money on craft food available to the crew all throughout the day: coffee, water, juice, fruits, veggies, sandwiches, nuts, chips, etc. </p>
<p><b>Equipment! </b>By equipment, we mean both lighting and grip gear rentals, which we are getting from a local rental company in LA. We want our camera team to be comfortable and well equipped, so we have arranged a good deal for our Cinematographer to have a 3 ton grip truck.  Additionally, we will also need to rent a zoom lens. We are trying to minimize our expenses in the camera equipment area, so we are flying the camera body and gear (provided by our College) out from Chicago. This is cheaper than renting it in Los Angeles, however we still need to budget in those flying fees for the 12 cases of camera equipment. </p>
<p><b>Transportation! </b>Transportation costs not only include shipping the camera equipment, but also reimbursing our crew to travel to and from set. We are reimbursing the gas expenses of all of our crew members. They are already donating so much of their time, the least we can do for them, is keep them from making any additional expenditure while working on our set. With this money we are also paying for a car pooling van to take our crew to set when we shoot in Rialto, CA. </p>
<p><b>Casting! </b>The casting process also incurred in additional costs that, although minimal, still need to be paid for. The casting studio, suggested by our line producer Marco, in the heart of Los Angeles was amazing, key in facilitating the auditions and allowing us to go through the process in a professional manner, comfortable to us and to the actors.</p>
<p><b>Art Department! </b>Production Design is KEY for the success of this film in particular. As part of the futuristic setting of the film, costumes will be designed to accompany the tone of the story. We have a great costume designer working in the sketches right now, under the supervision of our experienced Production Designer. Additionally, to achieve the ""Screens"" effect we need to purchase special contact lenses for our actors and extras to wear. This is an area where we need to spend just the right amount to achieve the look we are going for and make the story and the world not only believable but also engaging.</p>
<p><b>Sound! </b>On-location sound is extremely important for any production of any level. The way we see it, we want to get the best sound on location so we don´t have to go back to the studio to add ADR because of bad sound. For this, we have brought on board two professionals in the field who will make sure we get the best sound on set. For us, they are charging minimal fees for both their services and the rent of their equipment. We are confident that by having them on the team will add value to the film and save us money in the long run.</p>
<p><b>Visual Effects! </b>Besides editing the film, we are bringing on board a special effects composer to take the film to that next level of quality. He will be the one in charge of making the ""Screens"" come to life. His fee is something we need to budget in because it is extremely important to get the right person involved, and therefore assure us that we will get the results we need.</p>

<p>All of us are juggling so many things, whether we're students, working day jobs, or young professionals just starting our careers. Making these independent films together is so important to better ourselves as filmmakers. </p>

</div></div>","What is this MOVIE?

The Grove is a Columbia College Chicago Thesis film shooting in May 2015 in Los Angeles, California. 
Follow our journey on our tumblr page: http://thegrovefilm.tumblr.com


STORY

The story is about Mica, a 19 year old girl, living in the outskirts of Los Angeles in the near future. She is home for the summer after her first year at college. She is in a transitory time, not knowing where she belongs or who she is. For most of the summer she hid in her room, addicted to her wearable computer contact-lenses or “Screens”.
The film starts on a late summer afternoon, Mica is lost in the virtual reality world of her Screens. As Mica attempts to hide in plain sight, a 22 year old stranger, Diana, interrupts Mica’s session. Diana reveals that she doesn’t wear Screens at all and Mica is somewhat embarrassed by her addiction to her Screens yet too stubborn to give them up. However, before Mica can hide again, she is visited by her imaginary friend, Sonic. He takes her back to a place in her mind, a place where she used to have full reign of her imagination, otherwise known as The Grove.

The Team

We are a team of students and alumni, not only from Columbia College but from several institutions in different parts of the country, working on this thesis film that plans to go into production late in May. 
This is an ambitious project not only because of the story, but because we want to make this a high quality film. 
We hope to apply all the knowledge we have learned while in college to the different areas of production and come out with a film that we are happy with and that is relevant and meaningful to our audience.
We have the experience, we have the knowledge, we have the passion and we want to make this film happen!



Corinne Marquardt: is the writer&director of The Grove. She was born in the Netherlands as an American expat and has moved around much of her life. She attended Pitzer College for her undergrad and  focused on documentary and experimental film. She went to Columbia College for graduate school and has focused on narrative films, while still incorporating documentary and experimental elements into her stories. Corinne has pursued filmmaking since a teenager, and is excited to finally create this original film, The Grove.
Carmen Garcia Davila is not only the producer of this film, but she has helped produce every film with Corinne while at Columbia College. She is originally from Mexico, but she also speaks a handful of other languages such as Russian and Chinese. She studied producing while at Columbia College Chicago, but she is also knowledgeable about lighting, production design, cinematography and writing. Carmen and Corinne started working on this film in October 2014, and she has been a hardworking, resourceful and amazing partner! 
Kia Herman is a Production Designer and Costume Designer based in Los Angeles. She does film and commercials of all kinds, but her favorite genres are Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Post Apocalypse. She is well known for her work in the Award Winning webseries Player Piano, and she is very excited to be working on The Grove. She has a great positive energy, and her Production Design style is very in synch with the film´s visuals.
Tyler Bailey: graduated from Columbia College Chicago 2014 with emphasis on Cinematography. He has worked in almost every facet of production but has found his calling behind the lens of the camera. Every last detail of the picture is paid special attention with composition, lighting, movement and how that aesthetically helps tell each unique story. Tyler is excited to visit the West Coast for the first time in his life and what a better way than to partake in something he loves the most; filming and storytelling.
Alexis Garcia:  Despite her lifelong passion for film, Alexis first stepped on a professional set at 18, working as an extra for an NBC pilot. After two years working as an background actor, she finally changed her Marketing major and transferred to Columbia College Chicago to study behind the scenes work in film producing: the perfect mix between art and business. While at Columbia, she worked on numerous short films as a producer, line producer, and 2nd assistant director. In her final semester, she packed up everything and moved to Los Angeles to pursue her career in producing. Currently she's working as a production coordinator for AwesomenessTV and beginning an internship with Fandango in June.
Marco Roman studied at Cal State Northridge, in CTVA, with the option in Television Production. Along the way he found his passion to help out his community, and decided to Double Major in Central American Studies. Marco is currently working on multiple projects which include, the Latino Heritage Organization, who are partnered with NBC Universal, to bring awareness of the Latino Culture in Los Angeles through a PSA.  He will continue to work hard and accomplish his future goals. 
Ernesto Sin Alos is our storyboard artist, and currently lives in Mexico. He attended school in New Jersey and has been creating comic books, storyboards and concept art for numerous student and  independent films. Despite our distance, we’ve corresponded via phone/email/social media to bring to life the vision of the script. He has been so incredibly responsive and practically telepathic in creating the concept art for the film. We can’t be happier to have him part of this team.
Timothy Steinman: is the composer for this film. He was born in Evanston, Illinois and has attended school in Toronto and Chicago. While being the manager of a recording studio, he also works on his own experimental photography and sound art. Currently he’s writing the score for another film of Corinne's, and they've collaborated on other projects, such as music videos for his solo band, Arc of the Hunter. We are really excited to have him part of this crew, because we believe his music will bring a unique and complex layer to this film.



Impact
We are all young filmmakers and the only way we can grow is by making movies! 
By contributing to this campaign you are directly helping all of us achieve our dreams by making ambitious films like The Grove!
And even though this is a fictional film, there are many parts of this story that address common concerns about our contemporary society. 
Technological devices, such as smart phones, tablets, apps can definitely help us in our creative endeavors, but when these tools hinder our imaginations and alter our friendships, they need to be re-evaluated. 
We are also very proud of the crew and (now cast!) we are assembling for this film. So often film sets lack diversity and we are a group of people from all kinds of backgrounds, states, countries and our gender ratio is about 50/50. These should not be novel things, however the film industry has a particularly resistant glass cieling which we all hope to help break through!

</h3><p><b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>is about life! <b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>is about love and heartbreak, about guilt, fear, and friendship. <b><i>Ssrids </i></b>is about the times you snap at people you love and you don’t know why. It’s about when you’re falling asleep and you hear a sudden sound like a box-spring falling on a metal sheet. It’s about the times you stand up from an uncomfortable chair and your vision fades, you forget everything and you focus all your will just to stand up, until your cheeks feel cold and your mouth tastes like pennies and you remember who you are. <b><i>Ssrids </i></b>is about knowing it’s just a dream but being terrified anyway. It’s about the flowing patterns of triangles that swim through your vision when you close your eyes and look at the sky.</p><p><b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>will be a short autobiographical animated film about the time I went through sertraline <i>(Zoloft)</i> withdrawal. <b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>(short for <i>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome</i>) will be my attempt to show life how it feels. <b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>is not just about withdrawal; it’s about the simple, specific feelings and sensations that everyone feels, but that seem too inconsequential to talk about. <b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>will be the kind of film that makes you slap your thigh and tell yourself, <i>oh man I know that feeling!</i><br/></p><p>Most of all, I hope it's a doggone good movie.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>So who the devil are you?</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431032662/jvm3t1u6uidgmko05d18.png"" src="""" style=""width: 492.581px; height: 450px;""/></p><p>My name’s Jude, swell to meet you! I’m just some lost rambler who’s finally found some place he wants to go. Years ago when I was a frustrated teenager struggling with untreated ADHD, I dropped out of college to wander the world and figure out my life. I worked as a carpenter, became a graphic designer for a few years, learned to weld, went to France to be an <i>au pair</i>, and then last year I realized I had never pursued my dream of going to art school to study animation. Back as a teen it seemed so distant and impossible, but with a little time and experience I’ve come to realize the only thing separating me from my dreams is work and persistence.</p><p>Since that epiphany I’ve gone and enrolled myself in community college and dedicated myself to art and studies. I have been sketching, doodling, and roughing out little short animations for years now, but I have never felt like I was ready to dedicate myself to something as ambitious as a real short film. So this summer, I’m asking for your support while I jump in and go for it.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Okay enough about you, tell me more about <i>Ssrids</i>. What is it?<br/>
</h3><h3>
</h3><p>Sure! <b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>will be a short autobiographical cartoon done in hand-drawn 2D. It will be between five and ten minutes long, which will be released online to watch for free. I want to make something that is as exaggerated and cartoony as my favorite shows I watched as a kid, but earnest, emotional, and introspective.</p><p><b><i>Ssrids</i></b>, as best I can describe it, is going to be a sort of animated sketch journal. Even though I hope I can make it visually compelling, I want it to feel raw and unrefined. Visually, the style will be eclectic, representing the feelings I experienced at the time as if I were drawing my own life as it happened. Sometimes it will be soft, thoughtful sketches of life. Sometimes it will be wild, disproportionate scribbles. Sometimes it will be vivid and bright like a children's cartoon. The art will be like a sketchbook: fast, thoughtful, and unpolished.<br/></p><p>Similarly, the story will be like a diary or a piece of gonzo journalism. I don’t want to gloss over the details of life with vague “universal” generalities. I don’t want to scrub away the unflattering grit off my life. I want the result to be specific and honest, warts (and cliches) and all.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431048460/tinwbxxutdruuketf6ov.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Because of this approach, <b><i>Ssrids </i></b>does not have a planned script. I have pieces of storyboards and scraps of dialogue and miscellaneous art scribbled around my studio, but the final film will not be the product of a grand vision. <b><i>Ssrids </i></b>will be the collective result of my work and my experience and my emotions. But it won’t be just some psychedelic artsy-fartsy rush of weird images and sounds. My goal with <b><i>Ssrids </i></b>is to express my feelings precisely and coherently.<br/><br/><p>...But there will totally be a dream sequence or two. I had a lot of lucid dreams while I was going through withdrawal, so an autobiography wouldn't be complete without a few weird dreams.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>But what’s the point? How will the world be a better place if you make this film?</h3><p>When
 I was going through withdrawal, I did not know what was happening or 
what to expect. I didn’t even know I was going to go through withdrawal 
at all; it was a complete surprise to me when one day I woke up and 
promptly slammed my face on a door frame because I was too dizzy to walk
 to the bathroom.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431127355/irnipkvohaakyezruawd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Lots
 of people go through withdrawal all the time from all kinds of drugs 
and illicit substances. It’s difficult. It feels lonely, it feels like 
no one else can understand the feeling inside your head. I hope that my 
film will be able to bridge that gap; I hope it will be able to draw 
people together to understand, and have a good laugh about a time that 
feels so strange and dark.</p><p>Besides withdrawal, I want 
to share an honest and sympathetic perspective of living with ADHD. For 
some reason, even though millions of people live with ADHD, the public 
at large doesn't give a lot of sympathy to a condition whose main 
symptom seems to be acting annoying.</p><br/><h3>So what, you want money? What’s in it for me?</h3><p>There are lots of different perks to contributing! Everyone who contributes will be given a credit in the film, plus get the warm flush of self-satisfaction that comes with helping someone out. That isn’t the kind of feeling you can get spending fifteen bucks on a movie ticket!<br/></p><p>More heavy-weight backers will get limited-edition posters, t-shirts, and original art.  But all backers at any level will also be tuned in to insider sneak previews on the film’s progress! See the SORDID SECRETS inside my studio, and whisper your opinions right into my ear hole! Backers of this campaign will also be invited to preview the completed film before its formal release later this year.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431186283/em8rdsfekgzywnrtdked.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4>T-Shirts?

I used to work at a small-town t-shirt shop for about three years, so you’ll know that whatever I ship to you will be printed with the utmost care and expertise! None of that iron-transfer crap you can get from other places; this ink is high quality ink that will last you decades with proper laundry care! I can tell you from experience.<br/></p><p>(Note: Brain zaps don't really feel like that at all, but I thought it looked cool. So sue me for some artistic liberty with my own life experience)<br/></p><h4>Does that one perk say “erotic newspaper doodles”?</h4><p>You read astutely! Yes, if you pay at the $100 level and choose that perk, you will get a piece of my collection of immature, grotesque newspaper vandalism! How grotesque you might wonder? Well, take a look for yourself: <i><a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/xt9jO/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Note! Artistic nudity ahead!  </a></i>Don't like any of the drawings you see there? No problem: I will draw massive grotesque erotic scenes on <i>any</i> newspaper you choose (as long as it isn’t some rare vintage thing I can’t get my hands on, I mean come on).<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>No matter how the project works out, everyone who contributes will still get their perks. Even if <b><i>Ssrids</i> </b>fails to reach its funding goal and I am not able to dedicate myself full-time to the film, all of the perks are priced so that there is <i>plenty</i>  of capital left to print all the shirts and t-shirts and postcards. No matter what happens, I want you to know I appreciate your support.<br/></p><h3>Okay, so what do you want?</h3><p>My funding goal is <b>$2500</b> which is just enough for me to buy one of those fancy <a href=""https://store.wacom.com/us/en/product/DTHW1310M/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wacom Cintiq Companions</a> you see the rich kids at expensive art schools scribbling on. My old computer is on its very last legs, and I want to be ready to take it to pasture before it falls apart out from under me. I would be prepared to finish <i>Ssrids</i> on my trusty old laptop, but if this old fellow dies out on me, it will be <i>months</i> before I can afford a new one. While <b>$2500</b> is a little extravagant for a computer, the particular computer I want to buy is specially designed for art and will make it much faster and easier to animate!</p><p>If you all are extra generous, it would not go to waste! It would really help me feel secure and help me work on <b><i>Ssrids</i></b>. What can I say, up to this point I made a real mixed bag of life choices, and I'm trying to turn things around right now! Extra money would make my life that much secure in case something happens (personal injury, hardware failure, home fire), and that really is a tremendous difference that goes unappreciated by a lot of folk.<br/></p><p>After I am comfortable and stable, most of the money will just go to improving my standard of living (no more Busch! I’ll be living a Miller High Life from here on out!), but if I have enough money I might be able to afford:</p><ul>
<li><p>A proper art desk where I don’t hurt my neck working</p></li>
<li><p>A studio to myself WITHOUT DISTRACTING INTERNET</p></li>
<li><p>To commission an ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK and PROFESSIONAL SOUND EFFECTS!</p></li>
<li><p>To hire VOICE ACTING TALENT and maybe a golden-throated NARRATOR!</p></li>
<li><p>To drink NOTHING but PERRIER and CHAMPAGNE</p></li>

</h3></div>","What the devil is Ssrids?
Ssrids is about life! Ssrids is about love and heartbreak, about guilt, fear, and friendship. Ssrids is about the times you snap at people you love and you don’t know why. It’s about when you’re falling asleep and you hear a sudden sound like a box-spring falling on a metal sheet. It’s about the times you stand up from an uncomfortable chair and your vision fades, you forget everything and you focus all your will just to stand up, until your cheeks feel cold and your mouth tastes like pennies and you remember who you are. Ssrids is about knowing it’s just a dream but being terrified anyway. It’s about the flowing patterns of triangles that swim through your vision when you close your eyes and look at the sky.Ssrids will be a short autobiographical animated film about the time I went through sertraline (Zoloft) withdrawal. Ssrids (short for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome) will be my attempt to show life how it feels. Ssrids is not just about withdrawal; it’s about the simple, specific feelings and sensations that everyone feels, but that seem too inconsequential to talk about. Ssrids will be the kind of film that makes you slap your thigh and tell yourself, oh man I know that feeling!Most of all, I hope it's a doggone good movie.So who the devil are you?My name’s Jude, swell to meet you! I’m just some lost rambler who’s finally found some place he wants to go. Years ago when I was a frustrated teenager struggling with untreated ADHD, I dropped out of college to wander the world and figure out my life. I worked as a carpenter, became a graphic designer for a few years, learned to weld, went to France to be an au pair, and then last year I realized I had never pursued my dream of going to art school to study animation. Back as a teen it seemed so distant and impossible, but with a little time and experience I’ve come to realize the only thing separating me from my dreams is work and persistence.Since that epiphany I’ve gone and enrolled myself in community college and dedicated myself to art and studies. I have been sketching, doodling, and roughing out little short animations for years now, but I have never felt like I was ready to dedicate myself to something as ambitious as a real short film. So this summer, I’m asking for your support while I jump in and go for it.Okay enough about you, tell me more about Ssrids. What is it?

Sure! Ssrids will be a short autobiographical cartoon done in hand-drawn 2D. It will be between five and ten minutes long, which will be released online to watch for free. I want to make something that is as exaggerated and cartoony as my favorite shows I watched as a kid, but earnest, emotional, and introspective.Ssrids, as best I can describe it, is going to be a sort of animated sketch journal. Even though I hope I can make it visually compelling, I want it to feel raw and unrefined. Visually, the style will be eclectic, representing the feelings I experienced at the time as if I were drawing my own life as it happened. Sometimes it will be soft, thoughtful sketches of life. Sometimes it will be wild, disproportionate scribbles. Sometimes it will be vivid and bright like a children's cartoon. The art will be like a sketchbook: fast, thoughtful, and unpolished.Similarly, the story will be like a diary or a piece of gonzo journalism. I don’t want to gloss over the details of life with vague “universal” generalities. I don’t want to scrub away the unflattering grit off my life. I want the result to be specific and honest, warts (and cliches) and all.Because of this approach, Ssrids does not have a planned script. I have pieces of storyboards and scraps of dialogue and miscellaneous art scribbled around my studio, but the final film will not be the product of a grand vision. Ssrids will be the collective result of my work and my experience and my emotions. But it won’t be just some psychedelic artsy-fartsy rush of weird images and sounds. My goal with Ssrids is to express my feelings precisely and coherently....But there will totally be a dream sequence or two. I had a lot of lucid dreams while I was going through withdrawal, so an autobiography wouldn't be complete without a few weird dreams.But what’s the point? How will the world be a better place if you make this film?When
 I was going through withdrawal, I did not know what was happening or 
what to expect. I didn’t even know I was going to go through withdrawal 
at all; it was a complete surprise to me when one day I woke up and 
promptly slammed my face on a door frame because I was too dizzy to walk
 to the bathroom.Lots
 of people go through withdrawal all the time from all kinds of drugs 
and illicit substances. It’s difficult. It feels lonely, it feels like 
no one else can understand the feeling inside your head. I hope that my 
film will be able to bridge that gap; I hope it will be able to draw 
people together to understand, and have a good laugh about a time that 
feels so strange and dark.Besides withdrawal, I want 
to share an honest and sympathetic perspective of living with ADHD. For 
some reason, even though millions of people live with ADHD, the public 
at large doesn't give a lot of sympathy to a condition whose main 
symptom seems to be acting annoying.So what, you want money? What’s in it for me?There are lots of different perks to contributing! Everyone who contributes will be given a credit in the film, plus get the warm flush of self-satisfaction that comes with helping someone out. That isn’t the kind of feeling you can get spending fifteen bucks on a movie ticket!More heavy-weight backers will get limited-edition posters, t-shirts, and original art.  But all backers at any level will also be tuned in to insider sneak previews on the film’s progress! See the SORDID SECRETS inside my studio, and whisper your opinions right into my ear hole! Backers of this campaign will also be invited to preview the completed film before its formal release later this year.T-Shirts? What kind of t-shirts?T-Shirts with a big ugly mug on them!These are real-live cotton screen printed t-shirts! I used to work at a small-town t-shirt shop for about three years, so you’ll know that whatever I ship to you will be printed with the utmost care and expertise! None of that iron-transfer crap you can get from other places; this ink is high quality ink that will last you decades with proper laundry care! I can tell you from experience.(Note: Brain zaps don't really feel like that at all, but I thought it looked cool. So sue me for some artistic liberty with my own life experience)Does that one perk say “erotic newspaper doodles”?You read astutely! Yes, if you pay at the $100 level and choose that perk, you will get a piece of my collection of immature, grotesque newspaper vandalism! How grotesque you might wonder? Well, take a look for yourself: Note! Artistic nudity ahead!  Don't like any of the drawings you see there? No problem: I will draw massive grotesque erotic scenes on any newspaper you choose (as long as it isn’t some rare vintage thing I can’t get my hands on, I mean come on).No matter how the project works out, everyone who contributes will still get their perks. Even if Ssrids fails to reach its funding goal and I am not able to dedicate myself full-time to the film, all of the perks are priced so that there is plenty  of capital left to print all the shirts and t-shirts and postcards. No matter what happens, I want you to know I appreciate your support.Okay, so what do you want?My funding goal is $2500 which is just enough for me to buy one of those fancy Wacom Cintiq Companions you see the rich kids at expensive art schools scribbling on. My old computer is on its very last legs, and I want to be ready to take it to pasture before it falls apart out from under me. I would be prepared to finish Ssrids on my trusty old laptop, but if this old fellow dies out on me, it will be months before I can afford a new one. While $2500 is a little extravagant for a computer, the particular computer I want to buy is specially designed for art and will make it much faster and easier to animate!If you all are extra generous, it would not go to waste! It would really help me feel secure and help me work on Ssrids. What can I say, up to this point I made a real mixed bag of life choices, and I'm trying to turn things around right now! Extra money would make my life that much secure in case something happens (personal injury, hardware failure, home fire), and that really is a tremendous difference that goes unappreciated by a lot of folk.After I am comfortable and stable, most of the money will just go to improving my standard of living (no more Busch! I’ll be living a Miller High Life from here on out!), but if I have enough money I might be able to afford:
A proper art desk where I don’t hurt my neck working
A studio to myself WITHOUT DISTRACTING INTERNET
To commission an ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK and PROFESSIONAL SOUND EFFECTS!
To hire VOICE ACTING TALENT and maybe a golden-throated NARRATOR!
To drink NOTHING but PERRIER and CHAMPAGNE
Sacrificial goats to maintain my youthful complexion
Also, if my campaign is a big success it will encourage me to continue working! Any funds going past what I need to support myself this summer will not only help this project, but will go forward to let me work on my next animation!Yes, Mom, I’m going to get a “real” job too. Yes I am grateful for everything you’ve done to support me. I’m trying to follow my life’s dream, Mom. I love you too. I’m about to put away the dishes let me finish writing my proposal.So, what if it doesn’t work out?The good news is, I intend to make this film and release it online for everyone to watch for free with or without your help! Your contribution will help me make it faster and better, but most importantly it will let me know that there is someone out there who believes in what I'm trying to do. Moral support goes a long way.The bad news is, it’s totally possible that I will completely fail and not make Ssrids at all. If I don’t reach my funding goal, or if I run into unforeseen problems, I might not have the time to finish. And that’s a real bummer! I really don’t want to disappoint y’all; not only would I be failing you but I would discredit all my dreams of being a proper animator and of making another successful fundraiser in the future. In honesty, even if you only contribute one dollar, that dollar puts a lot of pressure on me to maintain your trust. If I fail, I might keep your dollar, but I will probably never see another dollar from you again.In order to keep myself on track, I am keeping the scope of my film limited, and the style is very deliberately loose and unrefined.

<p><b>Why should I support The Pale Horse?</b></p> <p></p>
<p>Ryan Fleck and
Immanuel Baldwin have created the immersive world of <i>The Pale Horse</i>, which
centers on two intertwining story lines. </p>
<p>Through lucid and
detailed storytelling, Fleck and Baldwin guide viewers into some of the darker
corners of humanity while focusing on the questions of mortality that human
beings have been asking since time immemorial. Using their unique perspective, they
have managed to put a unique twist into the story which will have viewers
questioning the separation of fiction and reality.</p>
Nelson Oliveras and his independent media
company, T.O. Media, will be producing the film, and they aim to breath life into it and give this story the stage it deserves. <i>The
Pale Horse</i> will bring together Milwaukee and Chicago area film-making creatives
on a mission to not only gain awareness for these local scenes, but also to
bring to life a film that will keep the audience hanging on and wanting more long after the
credits roll. Our mission is to execute this film in such a way
that it is indistinguishable from top tier union work. </div><div><b>How do we accomplish
this?</b></div><div>By hiring a crew of professionals and paying them scale rate for the work
that they do, taking what we have learned in film school and applying it on a
grand scale, and staying true to the underlying creative direction of our
story. <span>We have a specific vision for the film which
can only be fully realized if we have the budget to properly execute it.</span><p></p> </div><div>

</div></div>","Why should I support The Pale Horse? 
Ryan Fleck and
Immanuel Baldwin have created the immersive world of The Pale Horse, which
centers on two intertwining story lines. 
Through lucid and
detailed storytelling, Fleck and Baldwin guide viewers into some of the darker
corners of humanity while focusing on the questions of mortality that human
beings have been asking since time immemorial. Using their unique perspective, they
have managed to put a unique twist into the story which will have viewers
questioning the separation of fiction and reality.
Nelson Oliveras and his independent media
company, T.O. Media, will be producing the film, and they aim to breath life into it and give this story the stage it deserves. The
Pale Horse will bring together Milwaukee and Chicago area film-making creatives
on a mission to not only gain awareness for these local scenes, but also to
bring to life a film that will keep the audience hanging on and wanting more long after the
credits roll. Our mission is to execute this film in such a way
that it is indistinguishable from top tier union work. How do we accomplish
this?By hiring a crew of professionals and paying them scale rate for the work
that they do, taking what we have learned in film school and applying it on a
grand scale, and staying true to the underlying creative direction of our
story. We have a specific vision for the film which
can only be fully realized if we have the budget to properly execute it.

<p>So my name is Andre
Bright and I have 2 careers, Sustainable architecture, and dance (I know what
you’re thinking - “Often heard in the same sentence” haha!). It means my mind
is just as academic and logical as it is creative.</p>
<p>As a dancer, I know
first-hand it can be hard to find classes, but even harder to fill them as a
teacher (You have no idea!!)</p>
<p>But an experience on a
family holiday gave me an idea.</p>
<p>There I was looking
for hip hop dance classes in its birthplace. New York! My first visit and did I
know where to go!? Not a clue. So I did what anyone would do in my situation
looking for authentic hip hop dance classes in New York. I tried google! And
what I found was nothing. Furious. Only when I came back to London did I hear
of all the workshops I could have attended. Why? Because only those who were
friends with the teachers on Facebook, knew them personally, or heard through word
of mouth knew about these events. None of the teachers had a website, maximised
SEO, or put money into advertising!</p>
<p>Skip forward 2 years
and I accompany a friend to a tech jam where programmers gather to chat about
ideas. I get talking and an idea formed - an app that works like Tinder but for
classes! You can see what classes are in your radius! Even better, one that
also works like Twitter! You can follow your teachers and get notifications
when they create a new one, and invite your friends to one so you don't risk
going alone!</p>
<p>I know. I would love
to use something like this too!  The idea has developed since then! But it
gets even better!</p>
<p>Not just dance. </p>
<p>Not just London!</p>
<p>What if you could go
on holiday to Tunisia and find a cooking class near your hotel? Or a scuba
diving class in Mauritius! All with a few clicks of an app!?</p>
<p>So in short, I want to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The money raised will
cover the development of the app, but also the first push of marketing to get
international businesses onto it so when launched, it's full of all kinds of
classes, wherever you may be!</p>
<p>I’m asking for £10’000.
£6’468 will go towards the actual building of the app itself as per an invoice
from my developer (<a href=""http://www.simonkwilliams.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.simonkwilliams.com/</a>).</p>
<p>Most of the target
audience of those who will want to download an app to book classes would
already be online in some fashion, so I will be using pay-per-click strategies
to target local communities and niche markets.</p>
<p>I will also use it to
increase my virtual assistant's commitment from part time to full time so she
can really reach far into the market using tasks I have already designed. These
cover advertising campaigns through schools, universities and companies online
through social media and personal websites.</p>
<p>Finally, I will use it
to cover a soft launch at the beginning of August where I will get a testing group together (those who
commit to the ‘Trial Group’ perk) to use the app, test it and send feedback to
the developers for them to fix. Then I will hold a main launch at the beginning of September where I would like to hold an
event in London where people use the app to check into classes on the week of
release.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach the
goal of £10K, I would at least like enough to cover the development so it is
available for people to use and share but in this case, there may not be a main
launch event as planned.</p>
<p>In return for your generous donations, rewards
range from an email as soon as it's available for download on the app store and
google play, to having Find Me A Class available to you at the end of a phone
catering to your needs for a year! AND be part of the trial group so you can be
the first to try it! If you are a teacher or company that holds classes, we
suggest the ’12 month premium account’ perk for £15. Incredible value!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Since I am one of few
professional dancers in the industry of sustainable architecture, I am
constantly asked where people can learn to dance and off the top of my head, I
can usually suggest a number of classes close to them that they would otherwise
not know existed. Often I would tell a friend I am interested in learning
something and they would be able to tell me about a Spanish tutor on my street
or a driving instructor in my neighbourhood. Even a popup cooking class near my
workplace.</p>
<p>The concept is that
all those people that are being missed from the marketing of these classes will
fall to us, and that will be our focus. If we can connect the people to the
classes, we can increase attendance which is better for business, but also
better for those attending who can learn something and do it socially.</p>
<p>We are already doing
this on a smaller scale via social media.</p>
<p>We receive thanks for
teachers who say they had an extra 3 people in class who found them through the
Facebook group or someone asked where they can find a class in Cambridge and we
happened to have a teacher in the group who responded. We already have users
from Germany, USA and China. China!</p>
<p>We want to continue
having this impact but on a much larger scale.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>This is my first
venture of its kind for me and I'm doing it solo so bound to have stumbling
blocks along this already steep learning curve but I have come this far and
will remain as transparent as possible.</p>
<p>One inevitable problem
is bugs in the software. Whether being able to handle the influx of traffic (a
good problem to have) or functions coming up with errors. I have already
thought about this and have arranged for a soft launch which will only be
available to those in the trial group. I will host an event where those
individuals will be the first to try the app, create a few classes, RSVP, share
classes and generally give feedback on their experience. We will then send
these back to our developer to fix any bugs so in the main launch event, new
users are likely to have a better experience using the app.</p>
<p>Another problem is
updates. Because I want to get the product out there, I have left out some
amazing features which I have already spoken to the developer about. Idea is to
allow the app to generate income and then use that money to fund it! 2 in
particular, you will love!!</p>
<p>The final problem is motivation. Fortunately
for me, however, I have all the motivation I need. I have a business mentor, a
virtual assistant, an app development team and a supportive community around me
that are just as excited as me and already holding me accountable to my words!
Plus, having experienced the pain of trying to fill classes, I have the
determination to be the one that helps bring a solution.</p>

<br/>Lyme Disease is the fastest growing Vector born disease in the world. This disease effects 300,000 people in the US annually.

Short Summary
It all starts with a great script. 5 Minute Rush was written by up and coming Vancouver based actor/writer/director Steve Baran. Steve is a very passionate storyteller, his vision and drive are an inspiration. Weather he is working in front or behind the camera, Steve always puts the work in, giving it 110%. As this piece was inspired from a dark time in Steve's life, he is emotionally invested in the project, and is literally working around the clock to bring this story to life and give it everything it deserves.
Working by his side is the very innovative and amazing director of photography Cliff Hokanson. Cliff has worked with many action Icons like Jean Claude Vandamme, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Wesley Snipes, and many more. Cliff's experience and resume is beyond impressive. Cliff will take this film to a whole new level by aesthetically presenting the dark and gritty world we are trying to create. 
In addition to our team we have Tanay Genco Ulgen on board. Tanay is a very experienced stunt choreographer that will be coming on board to help plan the action design. His back ground in martial arts and knowledge of the technical aspects of fighting on and off screen makes him a valuable asset to the dynamic of our team. 
Together with our producers Kelsey Baran and Chris Rogers we have been working hard in pre production over the last few months, planning and dedicating our time in a valiant effort to bring you the best film we can possibly make. 

The purpose of launching this campaign is to help bear the costs of this production. It's very important to us because we want to ensure that we can obtain everything we need to tell the story truthfully and effectively. Taking this independent film and giving it the highest level of production value that we can achieve, and create the world where this story takes place.

Since business is not going too well,  Fuad also works night shifts in a museum of ancient Egyptian culture.  During these long, lonely nights he is repeatedly drawn to a statue representing the seductive ancient goddess ISHTAR. He becomes more and more allured by the goddess as she speaks to him in visions. Eventually he succumbs to her deadly charms.  After this pivotal night, Fuad begins a new life, in which murder and cannibalism become his daily bread.  He starts to prepare a ritual <a href=""http://www.fb.com/BloodFeastMovie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #c23d2c;"" target=""_blank""><b>FEAST</b></a> to honor his new mistress, a lavish affair dripping with <a href=""http://www.fb.com/BloodFeastMovie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #c23d2c;"" target=""_blank""><b>BLOOD</b></a>, organs, and intestines of human victims. As butchered bodies are heaped upon the Altar of Ishtar, Fuad slowly slips further into madness, until he is no more than the goddess’s puppet; and she thirsts for the blood of Fuad’s wife and daughter too...</div>

Herschell Gordon Lewis delivered his tale of a psychotic caterer to the big screen with never before scenes of on-screen gore, ground breaking for its time.  It is with his blessing and support we return to the original film for a brutal and bloody remake.Watch our teaser trailer below to relive some iconic moments from the first course as we look toward taking a new slice out of horror history.



This campaign is created from fans and addressed to fans of BLOOD FEAST. We, the filmmakers are longtime admirers of the original classic movie by HG Lewis and we would like to give you the chance to share your passion for the horror genre with us! Even our film is financed by this time we are here on Indiegogo with an aim to give you a chance to be a part of the BLOOD FEAST history! With your support of the campaign you will get a once in a life time opportunity  to grab an exclusive selection of BLOOD FEAST perks. Every fan of the original and the splatter genre can take part of a new chapter in the recipe book of gore.

Listen to the GODFATHER OF GORE himself!



Fuad Ramses and his family have moved from the United States to France, where they run an American diner. Since business is not going too well,  Fuad also works night shifts in a museum of ancient Egyptian culture.  During these long, lonely nights he is repeatedly drawn to a statue representing the seductive ancient goddess ISHTAR. He becomes more and more allured by the goddess as she speaks to him in visions. Eventually he succumbs to her deadly charms.  After this pivotal night, Fuad begins a new life, in which murder and cannibalism become his daily bread.  He starts to prepare a ritual FEAST to honor his new mistress, a lavish affair dripping with BLOOD, organs, and intestines of human victims. As butchered bodies are heaped upon the Altar of Ishtar, Fuad slowly slips further into madness, until he is no more than the goddess’s puppet; and she thirsts for the blood of Fuad’s wife and daughter too...

A BLOOD FEAST for the next generation of splatter fans calls for a new cast of characters. We are pleased to bring the following horror icons & fresh scream queens to the table.

He then starred in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street : Part 2"".

""Kit"" Carson began casting for the sequel to Hooper's iconic “Texas Chainsaw Massacre”, they discovered the actress, who ran screaming down the hallway of the casting office.  She burst into the room, pulled the chairs from beneath the duo and played the brief dialogue while huddled in a corner.  In that often told moment, she won the role from 440 actresses from both coasts.

After the successful release of the film, she moved to Hollywood to continue her career in horror (“Stepfather 2” - dir. Jeff Burr, “Leprechaun 3”  - dir. Brian Trenchard Smith),  mainstream films like “Days Of Thunder” - dir. Tony Scott, ”How The Grinch Stole Christmas” - dir.

<p>Hello! My name is Triana Andrea Melendez, and I'm a film director who runs a Youtube channel called Trianasaurus Rex. For the last two years, I've been building an audience by creating <b>music videos, dark animations, an original sci-fi series, vlogs, skits, and more</b>! In the long term, I would love to be a big-budget, <b>fantasy/sci-fi director</b> who transports audiences into new worlds in a <b>much deeper</b> way than ever before.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe I have done that with my <b>original sci-fi series</b> called ""I GOT STUCK INSIDE MY BRAIN!"" You can visit all three episodes (so far) here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/FxE8ofIySJk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/FxE8ofIySJk</a></p>
<p>I'm also amazingly proud of my animations. Here is a dark retelling of Rapunzel, with over <b>100 original images I have produced myself</b>, and <b>told in German</b> (with English subtitles): <a href=""https://youtu.be/wp1DyDXo5yY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/wp1DyDXo5yY</a></p>
<p>I absolutely love what I do. I never plan on doing anything else or stopping. Unfortunately, my equipment says otherwise. That is to say, everything I'm using to do the very thing I know I'm meant to do with my life is breaking down. <b>I'll need everyone's help</b> to replace the essentials to get back on my feet.<br/></p>
<br/>
<h3><span>Personal Background <br/></span></h3>
<p></p>
<span>My name is Triana Melendez, and my dream in life is to direct fantasy/science-fiction films one day. I grew up loving <b>the</b> <b>Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Matrix trilogy</b>, and so many more films that brought me so much passion and <i>excitement</i>. They've also brought me happiness during my early school years when I felt that my peers never really understood me. It was my love for these films and many like them that made me write my first book, which never got published. But then I made a connection: somewhere between <b>watching my dad teach and direct</b>, and finding myself in <b>leadership positions</b>, I discovered that I wanted something <i>much more</i>.

<br/><br/>From then on, my path in life was to direct films, and <b>I realized that I'd never want to do anything else</b>. I realized that my dream was to make films with not only <b>dragons, but witches, mermaids, and trolls</b>. And then I also realized that if I wanted any of these dreams to come true, I'll need to <i>get to it.

</i><br/><br/>So I went to film school, directed nine short films, and learned a great deal. I also loved watching films - old and new - at home. After everything, I felt really accomplished. I was proud of myself, but knew I was still only at the beginning. Everything I was doing also felt too underground to me: again, <b>I wanted more. I wanted more pressure. I wanted an audience.</b> But I had one major problem: I didn't have any equipment of my own.

<br/><br/>Through the time it took me to acquire what I needed to begin, I watched a good amount of Youtube videos and found out that it was something I really wanted to do. But I was afraid of recording myself. Despite my accomplishments, I was still very insecure about my appearance (in high school, I was quite overweight, which didn't make me happy, but I had managed to lose most of it by this time). And then I knew that <b>because I was afraid of it, I had to do it</b>. And so, I uploaded my first Trianasaurus Rex video. This was two years ago.
<br/><br/>Since then, <b>I've produced about 100 videos</b>, and <b>gained an audience of over a thousand people</b>. I'm so proud of what I've done. I've made a variety of different things, ranging from <i>an original sci-fi series, to music videos and vlogs</i>. However, something is happening that is threatening my ability to do the very thing I love.</span><p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why I Need Your Help<br/>
</h3>
<p><span>For the last two years, I've been able to put out videos every Friday, and these videos are ones I'm very ecstatic about. However, I've been working on very old equipment, which is breaking down. For example, on the almost<b> ten-year old computer I work on</b>, it takes over<b> twelve hours to produce a vlog</b> - a type of video that takes me the least time to do. <br/></span></p>
<p><span> In reality, this sort of work should only take four hours, maximum. The work requires this much time these days because my computer takes <i>that much longer </i>to process my work. For longer, more complicated works, it takes my computer <i>much, much longer</i>. And it is <b>getting progressively worse</b>. I am also working with no lighting. I had lights before, but they are no longer safe to use (<b>they burn more than help nowadays</b>). <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Because I have many other daily duties including my day job (which all goes towards meeting my life's demands), I require help to get the equipment I need to make my videos again, before mine completely break down for good (or in this case, <b>for bad</b><i><b>. Very, very bad</b></i>.)<br/></span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3><span>These are the things I need:<br/></span></h3> <ul> <li> <b>a computer</b> with all the specs and programs I need for film making (Final Cut Pro, Motion, Photoshop, Garageband, etc.) <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b> an array of microphones</b> to help me have professional audio without having to <b>re-dub each line</b>, which is a difficult task.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>lights:</b> portable clip lights, soft box lights, a light ring, etc. These lights will especially help in shooting outside and in my green screen work.</li>
<li>
<b>a green screen:</b> right now, I am using a homemade fabric of the wrong color and tone, which has worked until now, but it is not efficient at all (time-wise).</li>
<li>
<b>camera accessories:</b> these things include a camera remote control (so I can stay at the same distance to stop a take, which will <b>save time, power, and energy</b>), a monitor (so that I can see what my camera is shooting without having to walk back to it every time, which makes production difficult for a number of reasons), reflectors, and more.</li>
<span></span>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By being able to have the essentials I need, I'll be able to<br/></p> <ul> <li>
<b>continue with my life's dream.</b> With everything else I have going on in my life, it's difficult finding ways to replace the things I need. <span>Getting this equipment will mean everything. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>not only be able to make <b>higher quality content</b>, but <b>more content</b> that leads to <b>more videos a week</b>! I would save <i>so much time</i> with all of these items, which would, in
 turn, make me <b>more efficient</b>. Not having these things means that I'll have to stop the very 
thing I know I am meant to do.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Magic</b> will happen! <b><i>Wingardium Leviosa!</i></b><br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Challenge</h3> <p> Without the essentials, I will not be able to continue to live out my life's passion. I believe the work I'll accomplish in my life will completely <b>change the world</b>. But I need your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>I urge everyone to donate. <b>Even 1 dollar will make a HUGE difference.</b>
</li>
<li><i><b>If everyone donated what they would spend at lunch (with friends, during their lunch break at work, etc.), I would be funded instantly.</b></i></li>
<li>
<b>Sharing this campaign</b> with everyone you know will mean the absolute world to me! Thank you so much!<br/>

</div></div>","Summary
Hello! My name is Triana Andrea Melendez, and I'm a film director who runs a Youtube channel called Trianasaurus Rex. For the last two years, I've been building an audience by creating music videos, dark animations, an original sci-fi series, vlogs, skits, and more! In the long term, I would love to be a big-budget, fantasy/sci-fi director who transports audiences into new worlds in a much deeper way than ever before.
In fact, I believe I have done that with my original sci-fi series called ""I GOT STUCK INSIDE MY BRAIN!"" You can visit all three episodes (so far) here: https://youtu.be/FxE8ofIySJk
I'm also amazingly proud of my animations. Here is a dark retelling of Rapunzel, with over 100 original images I have produced myself, and told in German (with English subtitles): https://youtu.be/wp1DyDXo5yY
I absolutely love what I do. I never plan on doing anything else or stopping. Unfortunately, my equipment says otherwise. That is to say, everything I'm using to do the very thing I know I'm meant to do with my life is breaking down. I'll need everyone's help to replace the essentials to get back on my feet.

Personal Background 

My name is Triana Melendez, and my dream in life is to direct fantasy/science-fiction films one day. I grew up loving the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Matrix trilogy, and so many more films that brought me so much passion and excitement. They've also brought me happiness during my early school years when I felt that my peers never really understood me. It was my love for these films and many like them that made me write my first book, which never got published. But then I made a connection: somewhere between watching my dad teach and direct, and finding myself in leadership positions, I discovered that I wanted something much more.

From then on, my path in life was to direct films, and I realized that I'd never want to do anything else. I realized that my dream was to make films with not only dragons, but witches, mermaids, and trolls. And then I also realized that if I wanted any of these dreams to come true, I'll need to get to it.

So I went to film school, directed nine short films, and learned a great deal. I also loved watching films - old and new - at home. After everything, I felt really accomplished. I was proud of myself, but knew I was still only at the beginning. Everything I was doing also felt too underground to me: again, I wanted more. I wanted more pressure. I wanted an audience. But I had one major problem: I didn't have any equipment of my own.

Through the time it took me to acquire what I needed to begin, I watched a good amount of Youtube videos and found out that it was something I really wanted to do. But I was afraid of recording myself. Despite my accomplishments, I was still very insecure about my appearance (in high school, I was quite overweight, which didn't make me happy, but I had managed to lose most of it by this time). And then I knew that because I was afraid of it, I had to do it. And so, I uploaded my first Trianasaurus Rex video. This was two years ago.
Since then, I've produced about 100 videos, and gained an audience of over a thousand people. I'm so proud of what I've done. I've made a variety of different things, ranging from an original sci-fi series, to music videos and vlogs. However, something is happening that is threatening my ability to do the very thing I love.   
Why I Need Your Help

For the last two years, I've been able to put out videos every Friday, and these videos are ones I'm very ecstatic about. However, I've been working on very old equipment, which is breaking down. For example, on the almost ten-year old computer I work on, it takes over twelve hours to produce a vlog - a type of video that takes me the least time to do. 
 In reality, this sort of work should only take four hours, maximum. The work requires this much time these days because my computer takes that much longer to process my work. For longer, more complicated works, it takes my computer much, much longer. And it is getting progressively worse. I am also working with no lighting. I had lights before, but they are no longer safe to use (they burn more than help nowadays). 
Because I have many other daily duties including my day job (which all goes towards meeting my life's demands), I require help to get the equipment I need to make my videos again, before mine completely break down for good (or in this case, for bad. Very, very bad.)

These are the things I need:   a computer with all the specs and programs I need for film making (Final Cut Pro, Motion, Photoshop, Garageband, etc.) 


 an array of microphones to help me have professional audio without having to re-dub each line, which is a difficult task.


lights: portable clip lights, soft box lights, a light ring, etc. These lights will especially help in shooting outside and in my green screen work.

a green screen: right now, I am using a homemade fabric of the wrong color and tone, which has worked until now, but it is not efficient at all (time-wise).

camera accessories: these things include a camera remote control (so I can stay at the same distance to stop a take, which will save time, power, and energy), a monitor (so that I can see what my camera is shooting without having to walk back to it every time, which makes production difficult for a number of reasons), reflectors, and more.

   
The Impact By being able to have the essentials I need, I'll be able to  
continue with my life's dream. With everything else I have going on in my life, it's difficult finding ways to replace the things I need. Getting this equipment will mean everything. 

not only be able to make higher quality content, but more content that leads to more videos a week! I would save so much time with all of these items, which would, in
 turn, make me more efficient. Not having these things means that I'll have to stop the very 
thing I know I am meant to do.


Magic will happen! Wingardium Leviosa!
    
The Challenge  Without the essentials, I will not be able to continue to live out my life's passion. I believe the work I'll accomplish in my life will completely change the world. But I need your help.

I urge everyone to donate. Even 1 dollar will make a HUGE difference.

If everyone donated what they would spend at lunch (with friends, during their lunch break at work, etc.), I would be funded instantly.

Sharing this campaign with everyone you know will mean the absolute world to me! Thank you so much!

<p><b>THIS CAMPAIGN</b> is much more then just a film that we shot. It's something that has been more then a passion project the web series... before this feature film we just shot... saved us. So we cant put a price tag on something like that. It has become something much more then a film. </p>

<br/><p>We shot this film a year ago, principle photography. Since then we have been doing the fx. Well we came into some financial trouble and had to start doing outside projects and after so long we still haven't been able to finish because we keep having to do everything else besides our passion project. Our CGI artist even dislocated his spine while working on the FX because he decided to put in very long hours sitting at the computer and finish a giant action sequence in less then a month. He achieved his goal but at a price... We've been running into so many snags to finish this... and we need help. </p>

ALSO we will be absolutely transparent here. The film was filmed without paying the actors. So of course it being a free unpaid gig some of the actors didn't bother showing up some days and so we had to rewrite the story as we went and some actors didn't bother even reading the script and so their characters were not really what we wanted. Things were a mess because of this. So we have been editing around it and fixing it to be actually a better more engaging story! So what problems arose is becoming a happy accident. But we are going through a lot of problems that needs to be fixed that is why we need to roll some B roll and get some pick up shots of certain other scenes. </div>

This film looks like 100's of thousands of dollars were spent on it. But that is not true at all.

ALLEGIANCE OF POWERS
The fight for the city begins


We are the creators of ALLEGIANCE OF POWERS, MGI PRODUCTIONS LLC.  

MGI came from a rocky background as we built up from being homeless and living on a park bench. The only thing that pulled us out of our situation was the ALLEGIANCE OF POWERS web series that we created and it became popular and that was our saving grace. That brought us out of some dark moment in our lives. 
THIS CAMPAIGN is much more then just a film that we shot. It's something that has been more then a passion project the web series... before this feature film we just shot... saved us. So we cant put a price tag on something like that. It has become something much more then a film. 


We shot this film a year ago, principle photography. Since then we have been doing the fx. Well we came into some financial trouble and had to start doing outside projects and after so long we still haven't been able to finish because we keep having to do everything else besides our passion project. Our CGI artist even dislocated his spine while working on the FX because he decided to put in very long hours sitting at the computer and finish a giant action sequence in less then a month. He achieved his goal but at a price... We've been running into so many snags to finish this... and we need help. 
(EVERY PICTURE ON THE SITE IS THE SOLE PROPERTY OF MGI PRODUCTIONS FOR THE AOP FEATURE FILM!)


 What We Need & What You Get
 We need at minimum 9,000 dollars. 
OUR STRETCH GOAL is 35,000 - IF THAT HAPPENS we will begin production on ALLEGIANCE OF POWERS 2 ! 


I know it seems like a lot. And trust me... it is a lot. But in order to finish the film we need to do so much.  
300 more CGI FX SHOTS
FINISH THE FULL MUSICAL SCORE OF THE FILM
FOLEY for entire film
Actors ADR
B-roll
Pick up shots
EDIT 
composite 
miniature modeling
wire removal 
matte painting 
rigging 
SOFTWARE RENTALS




ALSO we will be absolutely transparent here. The film was filmed without paying the actors. So of course it being a free unpaid gig some of the actors didn't bother showing up some days and so we had to rewrite the story as we went and some actors didn't bother even reading the script and so their characters were not really what we wanted. Things were a mess because of this. So we have been editing around it and fixing it to be actually a better more engaging story! So what problems arose is becoming a happy accident. But we are going through a lot of problems that needs to be fixed that is why we need to roll some B roll and get some pick up shots of certain other scenes. 

WHAT PERKS ARE THERE? 
We have some of the coolest perks ever! 

What we have come up with is tons and tons of MERCH! YES, we have character wallets, guitar picks, buttons, playing cards, poker chips, etc! 


Plus we would like to allow people to receive actual ITEMS from the film, such as costumes, and props! 

We are also going to have skype meet and greets with the cast! You can learn their troubles they had on set, anything you want to know! 
SIGNED SCRIPTS! AND POSTERS! 
PINUP CALENDAR! AND MUCH MUCH MORE!

    



 THE Impact The contribution you give means more to us then you can possibly imagine. Again this is much more then a passion project of ours. This is something that the world has constantly been pushing down into the mud and we keep grabbing our shovels and uncovering it as it keeps sinking. 
It's such a fun engaging film that keeps you smiling and in awe the entire time. 



DO WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING? IF WE GOT THE FUNDS? 
Yes, I say so. Our last film LAKE FEAR (BELOW) was the first first film from DALLAS to have been SCREENED! (not just go and be in the film market) AT CANNES FILM FESTIVAL IN OVER 40 YEARS.  IT HAS WORLD WIDE DISTRIBUTION. 

 THE REASON I SHOW LAKE FEAR IS BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER FILM THAT WAS SOLELY OUR FILM. 
We have done many projects for other clients and those films have gone off to do great things but LAKE FEAR (for example) was a film we did our own, just us no outside help. Just like AOP (Allegiance of Powers) 



BANDS ATTACHED TO THE PROJECT!


BURNING SLOW 


THE KUL





SCARY CHERRY and the BANG BANGS




JENNY ROBINSON and 8EARCLUB
   Risks & Challenges The risks and challenges are immense. We have had so many things standing in our way, it is unreal. We just earlier this year had one of our CGI computers mother boards burn up due to all the intense graphical processes being rendered for this project. (luckily the motherboard was under warranty) But this project takes a toll. It is doing fx that you only see in huge 100 million dollar films. And that is what we set up to do. 


WE SAW FILMS LIKE THE AVENGERS and said... I have a dollar in my pocket... BUT I WANT TO DO THAT! I want to make that kind of film. AND WE DID. And we are still trying. And its been so incredibly difficult. But we are still pulling through to bring YOU an amazing blockbuster FILM, from an extremely extremely micro budget film. This film looks like 100's of thousands of dollars were spent on it. But that is not true at all. It's just been us and our passion and us using any credit card, any dime we get and pumping it into hard ware or anyone or anything that can help make this thing amazing! 




    Other Ways You Can Help If you cant donate what really helps so much is SHARING, and asking those people to at least visit the indiegogo page. If we generate a lot of views to the site it can make it to the front page and that can immensely help us! 
THANK YOU!
Below the picture we will show you where it all began! 





WELCOME TO THIS SECTION OF THE INDIEGOGO PAGE! This is the origin of THE ALLEGIANCE OF POWERS. 





ORIGIN OF EGOTAN AND CYBERSTING -  




Allegiance of powers did not first start out as a series or anything of that sort. It started out with Creators Gerald, Michael and Zach. They wanted to make a youtube video that will be about real two life people dressing up like super heroes and asking others to join them. This is the first origin video that arose from this. REMEMBER it is suppose to be cheap and bad. But this is how it all began- Not as a series or anything else but as a joke. 

WAS THAT NOT BAD! And if you  notice EGOTAN and CYBERSTING dont look the same. In fact Egotan is green. This was not suppose to seem like complete jokes but have other people make fun of them. No one did. The entire idea didn't work. 
We in total made a bunch of videos including watching them cook... None of it took off. 

HERE IS A STUNT THEY PERFORMED IN FRONT OF A SECURITY CAMERA , trying to make people believe every aspect that EGOTAN and CYBERSTING were real people. 

So then Michael and Gerald decided that the joke lasted enough and they should all make a quick little movie with these characters and get rid of them. So with no money and such they set out and made something quick and easy to say goodbye to these characters. 

That was this. 
But then they sat together and said. What if we made a web series of other heroes and made this world large and actually tried spending money and expanding this. 
SO THIS WAS BORN. 
(WEB SERIES TRAILER) 

BELOW YOU WILL SEE THE FEATURE FILM PITCH TRAILER. We made this to generate some kind of buzz about the feature film we wanted to make. Of course you can see none of this looks as good as the feature film trailer you have seen in already. 

HERE IS AN INTERVIEW FROM THE WEB SERIES RUN

AND OF COURSE HERE ARE A FEW TRAILERS FROM THE WEB SERIES.

Episode 2 Bloopers. 

A DORITOS COMMERCIAL THAT WE MADE STARRING EGOTAN AND CYBERSTING! 

AND OF COURSE ALL OF THE WEB SERIES AND EVERYTHING FELL TO A STAND STILL mainly because this was a free web series that we put out an episode once a month and we filmed everything every month fx and all and boom its out. Well we couldn't always get every actor out on shooting days, and had to rewrite the scripts and such so we just did not like how the whole series was going it seemed jumbled up and confusing when all the stories did in fact link up prior to shooting and having to change things up on the spot. So all of this became this.  (THE FEATURE FILM TRAILER BELOW)

Camera, lighting, and sound equipment

<div><b>Swostik's say</b></div>
<div>I am a 16 year old guy from Hong Kong, the largest trade port in the world. I aspire to be an entrepreneur. I doing my a-levels now and I take economics and business as my subjects. Through what I learn, I wish to make use into real business ideas. Leadership is one of my favorite concepts, and am currently the president of my school.

<p>Hello, everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Beverly Tan and I am the
writer/producer/director of the short film “The Last Line” which
has been presented in seven film festivals so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I want to make another
one where I challenge a few conventions and express my view of the
world a little more.  I want to explore a kind of relationship that I
feel has been mostly unrepresented in the media so far in a positive
and hopeful light.  I have produced several projects in the past such
as films and music videos but this gives me a chance to make
something for myself and share it with the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With your help, we can present a

My name is Beverly Tan and I am the
writer/producer/director of the short film “The Last Line” which
has been presented in seven film festivals so far.

Needless to say, I want to make another
one where I challenge a few conventions and express my view of the
world a little more.  I want to explore a kind of relationship that I
feel has been mostly unrepresented in the media so far in a positive
and hopeful light.  I have produced several projects in the past such
as films and music videos but this gives me a chance to make
something for myself and share it with the world.

With your help, we can present a
professional quality short film that will display a healthy same-sex
relationship.  It's no secret that this has been underrepresented in
the past and I want to change that.  I think you
want to change that.  I think you know someone who isn't necessarily
heterosexual who often feels neglected if not somewhat abused by how
“their kind” are portrayed in traditional media.  Maybe you are
that person.  Well, this is your chance to take a step away from this
negative tradition.

2000 euro to pay the sound designer and mix.
1500 euro to pay original soundtrack.

  We have been several times to Nepal and we know the conditions of poverty of the country (especially after the last earthquake in 2015).We got in touch with an association very active in that area of ​​the country, the Himanchal Educational Foundation (www.himanchal.org), which surprised us very positively for its activities.Therefore also aware of our privileged position of Western filmmakers that allows us to tell stories even in a country that needs much more than just movies, we decided to donate 25 percent of all money we will derive from this campaign, directly to  Himanchal Educational Foundation.We will bring them the money directly next November 2016 when we will come back to Nangi to finish the movie!We have already spent all our financial resources, now we need your help.Please help us to finish this movie and to show it everywhere in the world to improve women conditions in all the world.Help us spread the Magar women model!  SPREAD EVERYWHERE THE MAGAR WOMEN SMILE!                                                                 VERSIONE ITALIANA  Siamo un gruppo di filmakers indipendenti che sostengono da sempre le produzioni indipendenti dal basso. (http://www.fufilm.eu/chi-siamo)Pensiamo che questo sia il modo migliore per raccontare la realtà.Nel 2014 siamo andati in Nepal a nostre spese per fare un documentario su questo straordinario Paese.Un amica francese, Elsa, ci parlò di un piccolo villaggio situato sulla catena dell'Annapurna, chiamato Nangi, dove vi vive una comunità di donne del tutto particolare e unica.Così siamo partiti da Kathmandu e, dopo un viaggio veramente molto lungo di 24 ore, abbiamo finalmente raggiunto Nangi e  incontrato le donne Magar.La cosa che subito ci ha maggiormente stupito è stato notare come all'interno del villaggio qualunque tipo di scelta venisse presa solo per salvaguardare l'interesse generale della comunità, senza che esistano privilegi particolari. E come le donne svolgano un ruolo primario all'interno della comunità.Da sempre costrette infatti a vivere senza i loro mariti (la maggior parte di essi infatti passa gran parte della  vita all'estero lavorando nell'esercito inglese o indiano o nei Paesi arabi) le donne a Nangi hanno sviluppato una forte autonomia decisionale e politica, la maggior parte delle volte sono a capo dei gruppi che regolano la vita politica e le attività del villaggio, e hanno trovato anche diverse maniere di crearsi un reddito.Tribali ed emancipate allo stesso tempo, ci mostrarono un meraviglioso modello di comunità autonoma e sostenibile, molto raro nella nostra società iperglobalizzata.Immediatamente siamo stati rapiti dalla loro bellezza e semplicità e abbiamo deciso di iniziare questo film.Aiutateci a finire questo film e diffondere ovunque questo fantastico modello comunitario tutto al femminile.Sostieni la condizione delle donne ovunque nel mondo!                          IL FILM               LE DONNE MAGAR
La vita di un gruppo di donne che vivono a Nangi, un piccolo villaggio sulle catene montuose del Nepal.Sono donne Magar, producono reddito, prendono decisioni e amano la natura.Hanno uno spiccato  senso della comunità e hanno fatto del loro villaggio un modello di emancipazione femminile.In un Paese, il Nepal, dove le condizioni delle donne sono tra le peggiori al mondo, le donne Magar combattono con la forza del sorriso.Un film corale sulla vita di  queste donne viste nelle loro attività quotidiane: le attività dei ""gruppi di lavoro"" e la vita nell'erbolario, le riunioni della comunità e i riti religiosi nella cosiddetta ""Magic Forest"".E tutto Intorno a loro l'incredibile paesaggio di una delle catene montuose più alte e affascinanti al mondo. Directed by: Rosario SimanellaProduction: FuFilmFormat, Sound: Full HD – StereoLanguage: NepaliSubtitles: English/ItalianAuthors: Cristina Donno, Gianluca Marcon, Elsa Sallenave.Cinematographer: Marco LandiniSound: Jan MaioMusic: Jan Maio, Massimiliano Amatruda  PERCHE' ABBIAMO BISOGNO DI 6000 EURO? Crediamo molto in questo progetto e pensiamo che queste donne abbiano creato nel loro villaggio un grande modello di emancipazione femminile.Soprattutto in Nepal, un paese dove la condizione femminile è veramente molto difficile.Vogliamo diffondere ovunque questo straordinario modello di comunità, perché  ognuno ha il diritto di vedere i risultati di questo cambiamento.Siamo stati in Nepal a nostre spese e abbiamo girato questo film utilizzando il nostroequipaggiamento tecnico.Ora stiamo montando il film, ma abbiamo bisogno di più soldi per completare questo progetto.In particolare ci occorrono:
2000 € per pagare  sound designer e mix.
1500 € per pagare musiche originali.
1000 € per il color grading.
1500 € per finire le traduzioni dal dialetto Magar all'inglese.
  Siamo stati varie volte in Nepal e conosciamo le condizioni di povertà in cui vive il Paese (soprattutto dopo l'ultimo terremoto del 2015). Siamo entrati in contatto con una Associazione molto attiva in quella zona del Paese, l'Himanchal Educational Foundation (www.himanchal.org), che ci ha stupito molto positivamente per le sue attività.Consapevoli quindi anche della nostra condizione privilegiata di filmaker occidentali che ci permette di raccontare storie anche  in un Paese che ha bisogno di tante cose oltre i film, abbiamo deciso di donare il 25 per cento di tutto quello che ricaveremo da questa raccolta direttamente all' Himanchal Educational Foundation.E porteremo direttamente noi i soldi il prossimo Novembre 2016 quando torneremo in Nepal a Nangi per finire il film!Abbiamo già speso tutte le nostre risorse finanziarie, ora abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto.Aiutatecii a finire questo film e mostrare in tutto il mondo il volto sorridente di queste rivoluzionarie donne nepalesi!Aiutaci a diffondere il modello delle donne Magar!DIFFONDI OVUNQUE IL SORRISO DELLE DONNE MAGAR!",10.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>OUR CONTRIBUTORS</b></p>
<p>At the film’s heart will be two very different survivors: Arzu, a rural mother of six living on a remote farm, who was shot by her husband and Kubra, a glamorous Bloomberg newsreader, who has been left with a brain injury after alledgedly being attacked by her husband, a claim he is denying. We will follow their journey of recovery and as they struggle to bring violent husbands to justice in a court system that feels stacked against them. The film will also question whether real change can be achieved by changing the law alone.</p>
<p><b>WHY MAKE THIS FILM?</b></p>
<p>On average two women a week are killed by their partners or ex-partners in the UK. A third of all women in the US are murdered by their partners or ex-partners. Over 150 women have been killed in Turkey this year. This is an emergency situation, an epidemic that needs to end now. Violence against women is a pervasive, global problem and  we want to make this film to show that women can fight back and create positive change.</p>
<p>By using contrasting stories that cut across Turkish society we hope to  break some of the stereotypes about women affected by domestic violence and show the great strength it takes to break free.  We want to make a film that brings the viewer right to the heart of these cases and spark a global conversation about what we can all do to stop violence against women.  Most importantly, we want to give a platform to women to tell their own story.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>WHY NOW?</b></p>
<p>Turkey is a country in flux. In June, 97 female MP’s were elected to parliament. However, another election has been called for November that could undo that victory. We believe this is a key moment in history for women in Turkey and the stakes are very high.  Following this story now will allow us to give a voice to people on the ground, capture a dramatic piece of social history and will allow us to create a tool that can be used by campaigners and activists going forward. This story is unfolding as we speak and if we fail to capture it now, the opportunity will be lost, along with the individual lessons and experiences of the survivors on the frontline of this fight.</p>

<p><span>Delivery Girl is a short dark comedy film. It revolves around the events that occur just after a pizza delivery girl is struck by a car. We are first introduced to siblings, Theo and Jayne, Theo being the driver of the car is having to come to terms with the fact that he's hit someone, that worry very quickly fades away when he realises that the girl he hit mistakes him for someone else. He takes this as a perfect opportunity to confess his love to an unconscious and possibly dead girl.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Best friends Pip and Charlie and struggling to ease their boredom. Slightly drunk and very hungry, they decide to call up the Pizza company ready to complain about how long their order is taking. Once notified that the girl has been hit, Charlie takes it especially hard, he believes that he is the reason for this girl's demise and things spiral out of hand from there.</p>Delivery Girl takes a look at how people react to situations and scenarios in different way, it is often the case that comedy can stem from tragedy and this is what we would like to bring to the silver screen. These two separate scenarios come together in a comical yet dark way and we aim to bring out the characters and the unconventional forms of dealing with these situations to life.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<p><span><b>Theo</b></span></p>
<p>Is a typical teenage boy. He's starting to get more and more respect as an adult by his parents so he is starting to become a more of a dominant character, especially when it comes to being with his sister, though he still has some of the insecurities about girls that teenage boys usually do.</p>
<p><b>Jayne</b></p>
<p>Jayne is a few years older than her brother Theo, she has always been able to have her way with her brother but is now starting to realise that as he's gotten older, he's caught on to her tricks.</p>
<p><b>Bridget</b></p>
<p>Bridget is the unfortunate girl at the center of all of this panic. She is the delivery girl who has been struck by Theo. Brigit, is very pretty and quite confident, however she doesn't let her looks dictate how she treats people.</p>
<p><b>Charlie</b></p>
<p>Charlie is the smarter one when it comes to him and Pip. He lacks confidence, however and is not good at dealing with unexpected situations. When finding out that the Delivery Girl has been hit he takes it to heart and believes that he is the reason for her death.</p>
<p><b>Pip</b></p>Pip is Charlie's best friend, he is the complete opposite. Pip is a strong, dominant alpha male type character. Instead of reassuring Charlie that it's not his fault, he allows him to keep panicking and overreact. <br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Delivery Girl is a short dark comedy film. It revolves around the events that occur just after a pizza delivery girl is struck by a car. We are first introduced to siblings, Theo and Jayne, Theo being the driver of the car is having to come to terms with the fact that he's hit someone, that worry very quickly fades away when he realises that the girl he hit mistakes him for someone else. He takes this as a perfect opportunity to confess his love to an unconscious and possibly dead girl.
Meanwhile, Best friends Pip and Charlie and struggling to ease their boredom. Slightly drunk and very hungry, they decide to call up the Pizza company ready to complain about how long their order is taking. Once notified that the girl has been hit, Charlie takes it especially hard, he believes that he is the reason for this girl's demise and things spiral out of hand from there.Delivery Girl takes a look at how people react to situations and scenarios in different way, it is often the case that comedy can stem from tragedy and this is what we would like to bring to the silver screen. These two separate scenarios come together in a comical yet dark way and we aim to bring out the characters and the unconventional forms of dealing with these situations to life.

Theo
Is a typical teenage boy. He's starting to get more and more respect as an adult by his parents so he is starting to become a more of a dominant character, especially when it comes to being with his sister, though he still has some of the insecurities about girls that teenage boys usually do.
Jayne
Jayne is a few years older than her brother Theo, she has always been able to have her way with her brother but is now starting to realise that as he's gotten older, he's caught on to her tricks.
Bridget
Bridget is the unfortunate girl at the center of all of this panic. She is the delivery girl who has been struck by Theo. Brigit, is very pretty and quite confident, however she doesn't let her looks dictate how she treats people.
Charlie
Charlie is the smarter one when it comes to him and Pip. He lacks confidence, however and is not good at dealing with unexpected situations. When finding out that the Delivery Girl has been hit he takes it to heart and believes that he is the reason for her death.
PipPip is Charlie's best friend, he is the complete opposite. Pip is a strong, dominant alpha male type character. Instead of reassuring Charlie that it's not his fault, he allows him to keep panicking and overreact. 





We're a very big team spanning a total of 30 cast & crew members when shooting. Here's a selection of some of our Heads of Department.

Director
Gerald is a very confident individual who has experience in the different roles involved in film-making. Coming from a background of acting, he didn’t realize his love for being the camera till his mid teens. “Directing wasn’t something i’d considered until late in my studying when I tried it for the first. From that experience, I started to read more and into it and start practicing the art. I found that it came naturally for me when I loved the story to then direct it which is the case with Delivery Girl.”

Writer
Ryan is a talented comedic writer with multiple genres in his locker, he has developed online content previously and now looks to develop his writing talents on screen. “Half the time I hate writing, then during the other half I hate writing more.""

Producer
Ryan is an internationally traversed filmmaker, broadening his horizons in film genres as he aims to create a wide variety, of films. “Film-making is a mode of visual storytelling, stories are what make memories, history, experiences and emotions, without stories to tell, the World wouldn’t be what it is today”

<h3>Résumé - Pitch</h3>
<div></div>
</div>Le bonheur d'un jeune couple, Tobie et Isa, est chamboulé par l'arrivée du cancer dans la vie de celle-ci. Film basé sur une histoire vraie, Rôle de soutien est une exploration à la fois réaliste et poétique de l'impuissance que vivent ceux qui accompagnent les gens malades, ainsi qu'un testament du pouvoir et de l'importance du positivisme face aux grandes épreuves de la vie. Filmé de manière réaliste et en lumière naturelle, proche du cinéma-vérité, Rôle de soutien sera un drame poignant et inspirant. Le récit s'échelonne sur plusieurs années et se concentre sur les hauts et les bas d'un couple qui traverse la maladie. Ne sombrant jamais dans le misérabilisme, ce court métrage offrira au public une variété d'émotions qui le feront passer du rire aux larmes. Rôle de soutien, un film d'amour moderne proche de la réalité qui se tient à distance des clichés et des stéréotypes. <div><br/></div><div>
<i>The happiness of a young couple, consisting of Tobie and Isa, is shaken up with the arrival of cancer in her life. Based on a true story, Supporting Role is a poetic and realistic exploration about the powerless experience of accompanying a patient. It's also a testament to the power of positivity when facing some of the greatest challenges of life. Filmed in a realistic way under natural light, close to cinema-verite, Supporting Role will be a heartbreaking and inspiring drama. The story is told over the course of a few years and is focusing on the ups and the downs of a couple going through the battle against cancer. Never wanting to fall into misery, this short film will have the audience experience a mix of emotions, from laughter to tears, but never leaving sight of its goal: to be a modern love story, close to real life, far from all the clichés and stereotypes.</i><br/><div>  </div>

Le bonheur d'un jeune couple, Tobie et Isa, est chamboulé par l'arrivée du cancer dans la vie de celle-ci. Film basé sur une histoire vraie, Rôle de soutien est une exploration à la fois réaliste et poétique de l'impuissance que vivent ceux qui accompagnent les gens malades, ainsi qu'un testament du pouvoir et de l'importance du positivisme face aux grandes épreuves de la vie. Filmé de manière réaliste et en lumière naturelle, proche du cinéma-vérité, Rôle de soutien sera un drame poignant et inspirant. Le récit s'échelonne sur plusieurs années et se concentre sur les hauts et les bas d'un couple qui traverse la maladie. Ne sombrant jamais dans le misérabilisme, ce court métrage offrira au public une variété d'émotions qui le feront passer du rire aux larmes. Rôle de soutien, un film d'amour moderne proche de la réalité qui se tient à distance des clichés et des stéréotypes. 
The happiness of a young couple, consisting of Tobie and Isa, is shaken up with the arrival of cancer in her life. Based on a true story, Supporting Role is a poetic and realistic exploration about the powerless experience of accompanying a patient. It's also a testament to the power of positivity when facing some of the greatest challenges of life. Filmed in a realistic way under natural light, close to cinema-verite, Supporting Role will be a heartbreaking and inspiring drama. The story is told over the course of a few years and is focusing on the ups and the downs of a couple going through the battle against cancer. Never wanting to fall into misery, this short film will have the audience experience a mix of emotions, from laughter to tears, but never leaving sight of its goal: to be a modern love story, close to real life, far from all the clichés and stereotypes.

L'impact et l'utilisation des fonds amassés - The impact and the monetary reason for the campaign
Au-delà du fait de vouloir créer une oeuvre d'art qui touchera les gens, nous désirons réaliser un film inspirant. Beaucoup de personnes ont vécu le drame du cancer dans leur entourage et notre but est d'offrir une réflexion honnête et sentie sur l'impact que celui-ci peut avoir sur les proches du patient. Le film présentera un personnage atteint par la maladie fort et positif tout en démontrant que l’optimisme, la détermination et le courage peuvent être des atout déterminants dans ce combat. Rôle de soutien s'annonce également comme un exutoire pour le réalisateur Tobie Garceau, qui a vécu cette épreuve en compagnie de son ex-copine, qui a survécue. Il s'agit d'une occasion en or pour enfin clore ce chapitre de sa vie avec grâce, coeur et sensibilité.

More than just the desire of creating a work of art that will move and affect everyone, we have the will to make an inspiring movie. A large number of us know someone or have experienced the challenge that is cancer, and we wish to deliver an honest reflection on the impact that it can have on the relatives and friends of the victim. The movie will show a character who is sick, yet strong and positive. It will demonstrate that optimism, determination and courage can be the strongest of all assets in people suffering from this illness. Supporting Role will also be an outlet for the Director, Tobie Garceau, who went through this great challenge alongside his ex-girlfriend, who is now a survivor. This is a golden opportunity for him to turn the page of this part of his life with grace, heart and sensitivity.

<h3><b>The Challenge</b></h3>
<p>With the mounting humanitarian crisis in Calais, our aim was to design a building that could provide safe and secure shelter for the refugees over the winter period.</p>
<p>The key areas we identified that needed addressing with any design were:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Good thermal capacity - To keep users warm in winter, and cool in the summer</li>
<li>Watertight – To keep users dry and prevent damage to the structure or the user’s possessions</li>
<li>Lifespan – To ensure that ongoing costs are not incurred for the repair or replacement of the shelters</li>
<li>Transport – The shelters must be easily transportable to the point of need, and where access to the site is not clear</li>
<li>Installation – The shelters would need to be easy and quick to install to meet demand and keep any labour costs low</li>
<li>Cost – The price of the shelters needs to be as low as possible to ensure more units can be provided for those in need</li>
<li>Secure – The shelters will need to offer security for vulnerable people and their possessions</li>
<li>Modular – Any designs would need to be done in a modular form so varying sizes of buildings can be provided to meet requirements</li>
<li>Environmentally friendly – It is important that designs should not aim to avert one crisis whilst adding to another</li>
<li>Dignity – Often overlooked, we feel it is important to offer the users dignity to raise moral and hope. More importantly to be treated like a human being not an animal</li>

<p>The new refugee shelters we have designed addresses all the
criteria raised, and offer a clever and more robust solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>We quickly came to the conclusion that the best method for
construction of shelters is a closed panel timber frame structure. This will
enable us to offer shelters that not only have a lifespan similar to any new
build brick building, but also conform to current UK building regulations for
thermal performance.</p>
<p>There are 2 main ways of making timber frame panels. The
first is a SIP (self-insulated panel). This system has great thermal properties
but is very costly to produce. Due to this we have opted for a traditional
timber frame panel which will be closed and heavily insulated.</p>
<p>The shelters will be made in a very similar format to any
traditional building which includes:</p>
<p><b><i>Floor
&amp; Roof</i></b>– A fully insulated and structurally sound
floor and roof cassette. This will be heavily insulated and allow air flow
under the building keep it separated from the ground.</p>
<p><b><i>Walls</i></b> –
These will be closed panel insulated walls. Made from a 90mm CSL treated timber
stud frame, they will be fully insulated and finished with OSB internally and
Tricoya (water resistant wood) externally.</p>
<p><b><i>Door</i></b> – An
entrance door will be made in the same manner as the wall panels to offer
better thermal properties. Locks and handles can be placed on these doors.</p>
<p><b><i>Windows</i></b> –
Toughened plastic will be used to allow natural light into the building, with
fully insulated shutters provided.</p>
<p>To answer how the design meets the needs of the refugees we will go back to the main criteria raised for the shelters:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><ul>
<li>
<b>Watertight</b> – The use of
     Tricoya on the external elevations and roof will stop water entering the
     buildings.</li>
<li> <b>Lifespan</b> – The
     lifespan of the buildings will be <b>20yrs</b> however we expect them to last
     longer than this.</li>
<li>
<b>Transport</b> – The shelters can
     be flat packed in panels the same size as sheet materials of 1.2m x 2.4m.
     This means they can be easily placed on a pallet for delivery.</li>
<li>
<b>Installation</b> – The shelters
     can be quickly installed via a tongue and groove panel system. Panels can
     be lifted by 2 people into place and held together with a few screws. We
     estimate a 6 person shelter could be constructed by 2 people in circa 3
     hours.</li>
<li>
<b>Cost</b> – The price of housing
     1 person will be under £250 thanks to our trade partners, and by getting
     labour supplied by Preston College. This means the cost of housing one
     person in a habitable structure would be circa <b>£12.50 per year</b> over the
     lifetime of the shelter.</li>
<li>
<b>Secure</b> – The shelters will
     as robust as any traditional building, and have lockable entrances.</li>
<li>
<b>Modular</b> – As the design
     works via interlocking panels of 1.2m x 2.4m, we are able to create
     varying sizes of buildings to meet demand. The buildings could also be
     taken down after their usage and shipped to other locations.</li>
<li>
<b>Environmentally friendly</b> –
     All materials used in construction are either from sustainable sources, or
     recycled. This ranges from FSC wood to recycled plastic bottles for the
     insulation. The building will also be <b>100% recyclable</b> at the end of its
     life.</li>
<li>
<b>Dignity</b> – By offering a
     building that is fit for purpose, and meets the basic requirements that we
     ourselves would expect, we offer the refuges the dignity of their own
     home. This will raise moral levels and keep the hope of a better life
     alive. As we have made the design modular we are also able to construct
     larger communal buildings to be used for religious practises and
     education. These larger buildings can also double up as shelter when not
     in use.</li>

<h3><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></h3>
<p>The team including colleagues from The Halimah Trust, Pod
Living Ltd and Proddio are carrying out a reconnaissance visit to Calais this
month, where they will meet with L’Augerge des Migrant (Calais based charity)
to work out the logistics. </p>
<p>This is a not for profit project. None of the partners
involved will be making a profit. In fact a lot of the materials and resources
have been donated to bring down the cost of the shelters. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>There will be challenges such as:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The ground in the Calais
     camp is uneven and difficult to build on. There are many trees and shrubs
     and wind from the sea, as it is very close to the shoreline.</li>
<li>We will work closely with
     L’Auberge des Migrant to identify the most vulnerable in the camp and try
     our best to provide shelters according to priority needs. The Halimah
     Trust has worked with L’Auberge des Migrant over the summer to deliver
     food aid to the refugees. So they have a good understanding of the needs.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge is
     that time is against us and the weather is already becoming very cold. The
     refugees are from much warmer climates so they will find it especially
     difficult to cope in freezing temperatures as they have never experienced this before.</li>
<li>In addition to the shelters,
     we also hope to build a Mosque and Multi-faith facilities for the
     refugees, because for many, their only hope is through prayer.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>However small your donation, it will
make a difference. </b> But even if you can’t help to pay for the shelters,
that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask everyone you know to get
     the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>

     taken down after their usage and shipped to other locations.

Environmentally friendly –
     All materials used in construction are either from sustainable sources, or
     recycled. This ranges from FSC wood to recycled plastic bottles for the
     insulation. The building will also be 100% recyclable at the end of its
     life.

Dignity – By offering a
     building that is fit for purpose, and meets the basic requirements that we
     ourselves would expect, we offer the refuges the dignity of their own
     home. This will raise moral levels and keep the hope of a better life
     alive. As we have made the design modular we are also able to construct
     larger communal buildings to be used for religious practises and
     education. These larger buildings can also double up as shelter when not
     in use.




The Impact
 
You will be helping people who, through no fault of
their own, find themselves without safe warm shelters this winter.


   
Every contribution no matter how small will help
someone stay safe and warm this winter.
The situation in Calais is heart-breaking and
shocking, especially that it is happening in the middle of Europe.  This is a real crisis that requires real
action and you can help make this a reality through your support.





Risks &
Challenges
The team including colleagues from The Halimah Trust, Pod
Living Ltd and Proddio are carrying out a reconnaissance visit to Calais this
month, where they will meet with L’Augerge des Migrant (Calais based charity)
to work out the logistics. 
This is a not for profit project. None of the partners
involved will be making a profit. In fact a lot of the materials and resources
have been donated to bring down the cost of the shelters. 

There will be challenges such as:

The ground in the Calais
     camp is uneven and difficult to build on. There are many trees and shrubs
     and wind from the sea, as it is very close to the shoreline.
We will work closely with
     L’Auberge des Migrant to identify the most vulnerable in the camp and try
     our best to provide shelters according to priority needs. The Halimah
     Trust has worked with L’Auberge des Migrant over the summer to deliver
     food aid to the refugees. So they have a good understanding of the needs.
The biggest challenge is
     that time is against us and the weather is already becoming very cold. The
     refugees are from much warmer climates so they will find it especially
     difficult to cope in freezing temperatures as they have never experienced this before.
In addition to the shelters,
     we also hope to build a Mosque and Multi-faith facilities for the
     refugees, because for many, their only hope is through prayer.

However small your donation, it will
make a difference.  But even if you can’t help to pay for the shelters,
that doesn't mean you can't help:

Ask everyone you know to get
     the word out and make some noise about our campaign.


Please use the Indiegogo
     share tools and post the campaign on your Facebook, twitter and Linkedin
     profiles!


On behalf of us on the Winter shelters for Refugees project,
THANK YOU!

PROJECT INSPIRATION









Yesterday Was the Day We Died is a psychological drama about a discovery of one-self. It
is a self-exploration story that digs deep into the oppressed personalities
of  the human condition, and the frustration it carries. 
In order to express
ourselves, we go through a long journey towards our becoming in both life and art. Finding and losing our identities could lead us onto many paths. 
This film takes us through the journey of a one man's personal transformation. 

WHY THIS FILM MATTERS


At some point in everyone’s life, we’re not sure where we’re heading. Some struggle more than others to move forward.
This story explores a journey of what being human is all about. Searching for the answer to who we are, and who we want to be is a frustration each one of us faces in our lives. We either become what is expected of us or we embrace our true selves. 
Through this film, we share our thoughts and feelings about what scares and enlightens humanity, that is “Who am I really?”. With the surreal visuals and storytelling that we cherish, it is our goal to bring this unique genre back to filmmaking.

</div></div>","About: Great Spaces is an architecture entertainment tv series that focuses on modern architectural design all over the world. We cover modern libraries, hotels, offices, houses, landmarks, schools, pretty much a majority of public spaces even as much as bridges. Full of stunts, challenges, celebrity appearances and features, ""Great Spaces"" is far more than a design show; you'll find no boring talk about Doric columns or impenetrable conversations about blueprints here. It's the passion of hosts that make it more than just a design program.Plot Summary: 8  is an episodic film for the first season of Great Spaces. The bowtie-shaped 8 House 61,000 sqm mixed-use building of three different types of residential housing and 10,000 sqm of retail and offices comprises Denmark’s largest private development ever undertaken. The 8 House sits on the outer edge of the city as the southernmost outpost of Orestad. Rather than a traditional block, the 8 House stacks all ingredients of a lively urban neighborhood into horizontal layers of typologies connected by a continuous promenade and cycling path up to the 10th floor creating a three-dimensional urban neighborhood where suburban life merges with the energy of a city, where business and housing co-exist.








The Videographer: Julie Malmstrøm a creative video producer and photographer from Denmark. Mostly producing videos with cultural content: music videos, concerts, events, festivals, interviews, performances etc. She create videos and articles about sustainability, minimalism and the environment. She filmed and edited 8.
The Host: Delaine Isaac is the founder of Great Spaces, as well as a designer based in the New York Area. He created Great Spaces in the Spring of 2008 as a way to catalog his search for new ways to show spaces to the world through entertainment, humor, and intellectually conscious content. Educated at Rutgers University and NYIT. With office experience from Dattner Architects,Tronic Studio and on site experience with Isaac/ Associates, Jimmy Dumas Architecture, and UAI, he loves everything about design. He is currently pursuing a design practice with the interests of social media, video and film. Being taught by professors from Columbia GSAPP, Harvard GSD and esteemed architects such as Elizabeth Terragini which so far has been good for his obsession with traveling to various countries to share spaces you. 
Status: We shot the film in Copenhagen, Denmark in August and are currently in postproduction right now, about to begin the sound design, sound mix and score. The film will be complete by February 1st to start submitting to film festivals, TV networks and potential sponsors. But in order for us to finish it and get it seen by the widest audience possible, we really need your support!

the universal themes of a child longing for a parent’s approval, and the
importance of family bonds. </span></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Why This Film is Important</b>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a gay man whose father suffered from Alzheimer’s before
passing away four years ago, I feel compelled to tell this story.  According to the Alzheimer’s
Association, an estimated 5.3 million Americans of all ages have been diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease today. 
Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, and it will affect
many more people in the future. 
Chances are that you already know somebody who is affected by the
disease.  Often, dealing with the
cognitive degeneration of Alzheimer’s is as hard on the family and caregivers
as it is on the patient. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With recent progress in gay rights and changes in attitudes towards homosexuality in America, coming out to one’s parents may now be easier for those of a younger generation.  However, for those like myself, who came out at a time when there was less societal acceptance of homosexuals, a distance may have developed between them and their parents. While the parents might have accepted their child’s sexuality, they were never comfortable talking about it, and the child pulled away. This is the situation that precedes the events of <i>Time is the Longest Distance</i>.  In my film, Adam must reconnect with his father before Alzheimer’s robs his father of his awareness -- while there is still time for Adam’s revelation to penetrate his father’s consciousness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Despite this growing prevalence of Alzheimer's, very
few films are being made about the stories of those affected by this
traumatic disease. I hope that my
film will help raise awareness about Alzheimer’s, the need to accept
homosexuality and the importance of family love for all of us – no matter
whether gay or straight.</p>

</div></div>","Hi! I'm Bryan, New York indie filmmaker and MFA candidate.
Please
take a look at our project and support our campaign!

About the Film My MFA thesis film, Time is the Longest Distance  is my most sophisticated and most personal production to date. The film touches upon two topics that have had a lasting
impact on my life -- gay rights and acceptance, and Alzheimer's disease.  At the heart of the film, however, are
the universal themes of a child longing for a parent’s approval, and the
importance of family bonds. 







The Story


When an estranged son visits his
Alzheimer’s-stricken father in a nursing home to tell him of a major change in
his life, he crosses paths with a teenage boy who may help him discover his
father’s acceptance in an unexpected way.










Why This Film is Important


As a gay man whose father suffered from Alzheimer’s before
passing away four years ago, I feel compelled to tell this story.  According to the Alzheimer’s
Association, an estimated 5.3 million Americans of all ages have been diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease today. 
Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, and it will affect
many more people in the future. 
Chances are that you already know somebody who is affected by the
disease.  Often, dealing with the
cognitive degeneration of Alzheimer’s is as hard on the family and caregivers
as it is on the patient. 
With recent progress in gay rights and changes in attitudes towards homosexuality in America, coming out to one’s parents may now be easier for those of a younger generation.  However, for those like myself, who came out at a time when there was less societal acceptance of homosexuals, a distance may have developed between them and their parents. While the parents might have accepted their child’s sexuality, they were never comfortable talking about it, and the child pulled away. This is the situation that precedes the events of Time is the Longest Distance.  In my film, Adam must reconnect with his father before Alzheimer’s robs his father of his awareness -- while there is still time for Adam’s revelation to penetrate his father’s consciousness.
Despite this growing prevalence of Alzheimer's, very
few films are being made about the stories of those affected by this
traumatic disease. I hope that my
film will help raise awareness about Alzheimer’s, the need to accept
homosexuality and the importance of family love for all of us – no matter
whether gay or straight.

How You Can Get
Involved in the Production




Making a film is a complex process, which consists of three main stages: pre-production, production, and post-production.  With the help of an amazing cast and crew, we are now heading from pre-production into production.  I am certain that Time is the Longest Distance has the potential to be a beautiful and emotionally touching film with a lasting impact on audiences. 
Your contribution to my campaign will go a long way in making this film a reality, not only helping spread our film’s message but also helping me fulfill the requirements of my MFA degree.  As a student film, this project is dependent on enthusiastic and generous people donating their time and skills.  Without the contribution of family, friends, talent, and fellow students, this film could not be made. Just as every hand makes a difference on set, every single dollar you donate is important in order for me to make this film!To cover all of our film’s
expenses, we will need at least $7,000. The cost of film production
may come as a surprise to you but this pie chart shows exactly where the money
will go:

Your Rewards

Please,
consider making a contribution and become a member of our
filmmaking team.  You will receive

premiere at the Cityvisions film festival at the Directors

<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>-- <b>Sweden. </b> How the country is responding to the hundreds of unaccompanied children arriving each week. </p>
<p>-- <b>A refugee camp</b> such as Tatinghem in Nord Pas-de-Calais in France, otherwise known as “the jungle.” Already swollen beyond capacity, Tatinghem has led to the proliferation of <b>smaller, poorly protected camps across the north</b>, whose locations are well-known to trafficking gangs.  </p>
<p>-- <b>The immensely discouraging struggle of law enforcement </b>throughout the EU who are out numbered and virtually powerless against the well-organized trafficking gangs. </p>

<h3><b>Why a Film?</b></h3>
<b><i>The Power and Importance
of Storytelling</i></b>           
<br/>
<i></i><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>            </b>The task of the storyteller is not to solve the problem, but to state the         problem correctly.  -- Anton Chekov</i><br/></p>
<p>Given the overwhelming immediate
needs of hundreds of thousands of EU refugees as winter approaches-- food,
shelter, and health care among them-- why invest in the pre-production of a
film? 

<br/></p>
<p>What <b>difference </b>will a film make, and what will it accomplish?
</p>
<p>There are two basic answers:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Public awareness and public
discourse are <b>essential ingredients </b>in
any struggle against oppression and injustice. Fighting modern slavery without
an informed and engaged general public is like fighting a war without an army:
it’s a losing battle.  </p>
<p><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>2.</b> In the 21st century, the genre
of film has become one of the most effective and powerful vehicles we have to
create awareness of human rights issues on a global scale. More and more,the language of film—<b>images, music, narrative-- </b>is becoming the language of the world, spoken
and understood by billions.<b> We only need to recall the photograph of 3 year-old Aylan Kurdi, </b>washed up on a Turkish
beach, to understand how a even a single image has the power to shake the
conscience of the world. </p>
Given the importance of awareness on
the one hand, and the power of film on the other, we have <b>two choices:</b><br/><p>-- <i><b>Do nothing</b> on the awareness front, allow the ignorance
and denial to continue, and give the traffickers free rein.</i></p>
<i></i><p></p>
<p>-- <i><b>Make a film</b> such as
</i>Heart of the Matter<i>, raise an army, and fight back.  </i>
</p>
<p></p>

then all of the problems already facing the refugees will only get worse
if large numbers of them are trafficked. More health problems including HIV/AIDS.
More violence against women and children. More loss of human dignity and life.</div>
<div>  
<p>If, on the other hand, we <b>accept </b>that broad awareness is key to
the success of any human rights struggle; accept the fact that the <i>status

<i>Why We Need Pre-production Funding 
</i>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Pre-production may not be the most exciting aspect of documentary filmmaking, but in many ways it is the most important. Research, salaries, location scouting, travel, and scripting are a few of the essential elements that go into the documentary storytelling process. You can’t get to the production phase without it! </p>
<p>After months of research and hundreds of conversations with colleagues throughout the international human rights community, we have laid a solid foundation for the pre-production phase of the project and are ready to begin immediately. </p>
<p>Our $30,000 goal for this campaign represents the minimum we need to get started.  If we raise additional funds during this campaign, they will allow us to keep the project moving forward toward the production phase and completion, which is slated for May, 2016. </p>
<p>If we fall short of our goal, funds raised will still be valuable and important, as they will support our overall fundraising effort for <i>Heart of the Matter</i>, as well as our ability to sustain global human trafficking awareness initiatives we are working on in other parts of the world as well.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>
<i>Challenges
</i>
</h4>
<p>Identifying and securing funding for
our documentary film projects remains the biggest challenge our team-- or any
team doing this kind of work-- faces. We have been making influential and highly
regarded documentaries on global human rights issues for 30 years and
we know from experience how challenging the fundraising process can be. </p>
<p>We feel the urgency to begin work on <i>Heart of the Matter</i> is too great to rely on any single sector of the international funding community, and that is why this campaign is so important to us,  <b>we very much need your help! </b></p>
<p>The bottom line is that <b>the EU refugee crisis is getting worse by the day.</b> We feel a huge sense of responsibility here
because we know that our film can
make a difference and even save lives. </p>

About the Film



Heart of the Matter is a short (20 – 25 minute) film that will
serve as a companion piece to Not My Life, the
universally acclaimed Worldwide Documentaries film about the horrors and
ubiquity of global human trafficking. Heart of the Matter has been conceived in response to the
current refugee crisis in Europe, where hundreds of thousands of refugees,
especially children, are at risk of being trafficked in the months and years
ahead. 

A Disaster in the Making



Don't look at the numbers, look at the faces.  --Pope Francis 


In the EU, the intense, daily preoccupation with
the consequences of massive immigration has created a huge awareness gap with
respect to the most dangerous consequence of all: human trafficking, and the
creation of a perfect storm of vulnerability that will allow organized crime to
prey on children and their families for months and
years to come. “The traffickers have already begun their feast,” asserts one
Italian police official. “Last year alone, 5,000 children disappeared from reception
centers here in Italy, and we have no idea where they are.” Working with, or within, the mafia and
other criminal networks, EU traffickers are particularly ruthless and powerful.
Numbering over 30,000
facilitators, agents, and middlemen, traffickers are kidnapping children for labor, sex,
begging, and other forms of servitude. Many of these refugee children are stateless and denied basic rights, leaving them particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Add to this the forcing of women into prostitution
rings, and the coercion of men into menial jobs without pay, and one
sees a continent increasingly populated with slaves-- most of them young-- and
the flourishing and entrenchment of a crime business whose profits
are in the billions of Euros. It is a recipe for a human disaster. Who, What and Where  
Led by Oscar® nominee and Not
My Life producer Robert Bilheimer, a small team of filmmakers will crisscross the
European continent to depict narratives such
as the following: 





-- Sweden.  How the country is responding to the hundreds of unaccompanied children arriving each week. 
-- A refugee camp such as Tatinghem in Nord Pas-de-Calais in France, otherwise known as “the jungle.” Already swollen beyond capacity, Tatinghem has led to the proliferation of smaller, poorly protected camps across the north, whose locations are well-known to trafficking gangs.  
-- The immensely discouraging struggle of law enforcement throughout the EU who are out numbered and virtually powerless against the well-organized trafficking gangs. 

These and other narratives will form
the matrix of Heart of the Matter, a clarion call that must be heard
immediately if an already bad situation is not to get much worse. 




Why a Film?
The Power and Importance
of Storytelling           



            The task of the storyteller is not to solve the problem, but to state the         problem correctly.  -- Anton Chekov
Given the overwhelming immediate
needs of hundreds of thousands of EU refugees as winter approaches-- food,
shelter, and health care among them-- why invest in the pre-production of a

What difference will a film make, and what will it accomplish?

There are two basic answers:
1. Public awareness and public

Given the importance of awareness on

and denial to continue, and give the traffickers free rein.

-- Make a film such as
Heart of the Matter, raise an army, and fight back.  


If we do nothing,
then all of the problems already facing the refugees will only get worse
if large numbers of them are trafficked. More health problems including HIV/AIDS.
More violence against women and children. More loss of human dignity and life.
  
If, on the other hand, we accept that broad awareness is key to

Reaching the Audience & the
Power of Partnership
Worldwide Documentaries is widely recognized as a pioneer in global awareness and

We have reached over a billion people with our films over the past 30 years, and

international development and law enforcement agencies, faith-based communities
and organizations, student groups, service providers including national call-in

About Our Campaign 




Why We Need Pre-production Funding 



Pre-production may not be the most exciting aspect of documentary filmmaking, but in many ways it is the most important. Research, salaries, location scouting, travel, and scripting are a few of the essential elements that go into the documentary storytelling process. You can’t get to the production phase without it! 
After months of research and hundreds of conversations with colleagues throughout the international human rights community, we have laid a solid foundation for the pre-production phase of the project and are ready to begin immediately. 
Our $30,000 goal for this campaign represents the minimum we need to get started.  If we raise additional funds during this campaign, they will allow us to keep the project moving forward toward the production phase and completion, which is slated for May, 2016. 
If we fall short of our goal, funds raised will still be valuable and important, as they will support our overall fundraising effort for Heart of the Matter, as well as our ability to sustain global human trafficking awareness initiatives we are working on in other parts of the world as well.  
 

Challenges


Identifying and securing funding for
our documentary film projects remains the biggest challenge our team-- or any
team doing this kind of work-- faces. We have been making influential and highly
regarded documentaries on global human rights issues for 30 years and
we know from experience how challenging the fundraising process can be. 
We feel the urgency to begin work on Heart of the Matter is too great to rely on any single sector of the international funding community, and that is why this campaign is so important to us,  we very much need your help! 
The bottom line is that the EU refugee crisis is getting worse by the day. We feel a huge sense of responsibility here
because we know that our film can
make a difference and even save lives.

<p>We are TheLowFlyingGeese, independent film makers from Manchester. We currently have our debut feature film in post production entitled 'Strange-Days in Strange-Ways' AKA 'Rum Bastards'.

The
Story

John
Garland's peaceful life in Silent Hill ends with the mysterious chain
of murders committed by his former schoolmate, Walter Sullivan. After
his arrest, Sullivan commits suicide in his Prison Cell but the
feeling of uneasiness still surrounds Silent Hill. John and his
girlfriend Melissa Fitch soon leave  the town behind.

Years later John suddenly finds himself back in Silent Hill. The
town has filled up with nightmarish delusions and eerie fog. A
weird shadowy figure seems to follow him everywhere. While running
away, John finds Melissa who seems distressed. Her sister, Katherine
Fitch, has disappeared somewhere in the town. A local priest starts
helping the couple in their search but nothing seems to be right, no
encounter feels natural and no one is acting normally. John
believes the right thing to do is to find Katherine and a way out of
the hell they're trapped in.

The thick
fog covers the rural northeastern town, as if to hide its secrets. An
enigmatic religious cult seems to be involved but in Silent Hill the
truth is hard to find and mostly just an interpretation. Somethings
are better left unseen and some promises left unfulfilled.

</h3> <p>My name is Abby Whisenant, and I'm a teaching artist, storyteller &amp; civic engagement leader living in Nashville, TN. I've been teaching community art classes for more than a decade, and I share stories of the human experience through my documentary photography. These two passions have led me to my current position at the Underground Art Studio at Oasis, an art studio I founded for high-risk youth. <br/></p>
<p>Throughout my first two years in the studio, I have led multiple community-based art projects with youth and local artists. I have also trained other community artists on how to authentically engage non-artists as co-creators in their projects. Now, I'm looking for ways to learn more about social practice art and to challenge and inspire myself professionally.<br/></p>
<p>A dear friend recently shared an opportunity with me through ArtCorps - <b><i>Culture and Arts for Social Change in Cuba</i></b>. This people-to-people journey will focus on Cuba's dynamic culture and arts scene through the lens of ArtCorps' framework and experiential methodology of individual empowerment, community development, and systemic change. Throughout the 9-day immersive experience, I will have the opportunity to practice my own art of photography and writing while also learning from individual artists and visiting community art projects to witness how art and culture are used to effect systemic change, develop positive solutions to community challenges, and revitalize neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It has always been a dream of mine to visit Cuba - a place rich with music, arts and culture. To be able to visit this beautiful country <i>and </i>explore the good work these social practice artists are doing in their communities is more than a dream come true - and it will remain just a dream without your support.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Let Me Break It Down<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>I have diligently explored funding options through my employer, our local and state arts agencies, and grants from various national funders, but any 
funding I would have qualified for has already closed for the fiscal 
year. So, I turn to you: my friends, my family, perfect strangers around
 the world. <br/></p>
<p>The cost of this learning journey is $4,250, which includes: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>round trip airfare from Miami to Havana</li>
<li>lodging &amp; transportation for nine days</li>
<li>most meals &amp; water<br/>
</li>
<li>program activities &amp; fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Cuban Tourist Visa</li>
<li>honoraria to speakers <br/>
</li>
<li>donations to NGO hosts<br/>
</li>
</ul>I added an additional $250 to this project budget to cover my round trip airfare from Nashville to Miami, which brings the total project budget to $4,500. I have not included extra meals or activities, photo film &amp; development, or souvenirs in this budget.<br/><br/>With your support, I know I will reach my goal - but if for some reason I do not, I will still receive the funds I have raised. If there is an unmanageable amount of funds yet to be raised, I will request refunds for contributors. However, if I can arrange a payment plan with the trip organizers for the remaining amount, I will move forward with the project as planned.<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Payoff<br/>
</h3> <p>Your contribution to this project will have a meaningful impact beyond my own professional and artistic  development. Not only will there will be many opportunities for me to interact with social practice artists in Havana, but I will also be joined my more than 20 artists from around the world. I will certainly be learning from all of those around me, but I believe there will also be opportunities for me to share with my peers on the trip the great work I'm familiar with in my hometown of Nashville. <br/></p>
<p>Similarly, I plan to incorporate my experiences on this journey and the new knowledge I gain into the free workshops I lead for community artists in Nashville. I aim to document as much as possible to share with my peers in the art community as well as my youth development colleagues at Oasis. <br/></p>
<p>Any time I grow as a person, it only positively impacts the youth I interact with on a weekly basis. It is also my intention to share this experience with them and to model for them an attitude of motivation and resourcefulness, an unending curiosity for learning, and a great appreciation for the expertise and culture of others.</p>
<p>Lastly, you'll get cool stuff! I'm an artist, duh! Here are some of the fantastic perks I've created to celebrate your contribution and to share in this journey with you:<br/></p> <ul> <li>a personal, handwritten postcard mailed from Havana</li>
<li>several photo print options (framed &amp; unframed)</li>

So, if you're unable to make a financial contribution to this project, please consider helping me spread the word.<br/></p>Forward an email I shared with you or simply repost my plea on Instagram (@abbywanders). You can also use the share tools right here on Indiegogo to choose your own social media poison.<br/><br/>No matter what, I appreciate that you've taken the time to read this far into my story.

<p>David’s girlfriend MUMTAZ has died. She was a photographer by profession, working in the

heartlands of central India. David is a German diplomat working in India since four years.</p>
<p>Still reeling from the loss, he travels to the city of her birth, a city that he has never visited before.
  
  Here, he seeks out DR. SHARDA, a cynical old man who could lead him to the place, buried in the
  
  interiors of the country, where Mumtaz last was.  </p>
<p>A journey into the heart of the country leads David simultaneously into its past. A past, it turns out,
  
  that binds the Doctor and Mumtaz. Dr. Sharda is revealed to be the commander of a camp, training
  
  young boys in combat against the State. Mumtaz, documenting the Doctor's camp, had captured
  
  the brutalization of one of its young inmates KRISHNA, at the hands of his own peers.
</p>
<p>Mumtaz's searching spirit is reflected in another female character, RADHA, a young nurse working as a surrogate mother, whose longing to be independent is a quietly cherished dream. Radha's appearance in the film is independent of the other stories.That is, until we realise that she too had once existed within the structures of violence, of which the Doctor and his army were an integral part.</p>
<p>Drawing together these narratives, the film creates a multificated picture of present day India, a society in the throes of change, struggling to break the shackles of its past and emerge into the future. </p>

<p>DUST is as much a story about a place as it is about its characters. Both place and character are

moulded by the process of transformation underway in Indian society today. Indore, the city of my

birth, has changed rapidly over the last decade and its transformation is not unlike that of other

small cities in India. Indore therefore provides an ideal setting for DUST.</p>
<p>In order to capture aspects of this ongoing transformation in its most authentic form, DUST will be

shot on real locations in and around Indore, using minimal lighting and production design. The

documentary style of shooting will also enable us to improvise scenes with actors and the

inhabitants of the city.</p>

</span></p>
<p>And a story about transformation in India must grapple with an even more complex experience of

time. As one of the characters in the film points out: <br/>
<i>... in our language (Hindi), both the past and the future go by the same name - Kal</i>...</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(44,34,16); font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>What kind of transformation is possible in a culture in which conceptions of past and future might be inextricably linked?</i></span></p>
<p>This is a question that excited me from the beginning. This conception of time informs the

narrative structure of DUST. The past and future are intervowen seamlessly into the present,

touching each other in their progress. As with life, where one cannot hold apart the present, the

past, dream and memory from each other, so too is the movement between the different time layers

of the film­they flow into each other, connecting naturally during the course of the film.</p>
<p>
  Doing so, the reality of the film provides room for the “contradictions” that surround us in India

everyday: a highly modern society, yet never far away from its past, a country of many histories,

existences, cultures, languages and constrasts, a land that exists simultaneously in different eras. </p>

<p>The transformation in our society is being driven to a large extent by women. In my immediate

environment, I am surrounded by strong women, whose ideas have not only influenced me to write

DUST, but have also made me aware of a need to explore narrative structures that reflect women's

experiences and perceptions.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(44,34,16); font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>One such effort is DUST. Although beginning with a traditional narrative (man seeking his lost

love), DUST cracks open this conventional and exhausted narrative, enabling its female

characters to emerge, not as heroines or goddesses or larger (or lesser) than life figures, but a as

individuals steering through a complex and ever changing society. And like the world they

inhabit, they too are ever changing, adaptable figures.</i></span></p>
<p> At the end of the film, Mumtaz, Radha and the other women characters in the film set off on a

journey, their path stretching out into the unknown but illuminated by their desire for freedom. It is

this movement of the female characters in my film that is the triumphant spirit of DUST.</p>
<p> Thus David's encounter with an ageing partriachal world turns into a narrative embodying a fresh

hope: the hope that in these times of change, a new path forged by women in our society may

present an alternative to the structures of violence perpetuated throughout times.</p>

<p>DUST is a low budget film, but it is 80% financed. However, we're missing the last critical stretch which will allow us to produce this independent film, fully shot in India. </p>
<p>We've received money through a German Film Fund and the Film University Babelsberg will be supporting us with equipment and postproduction resources.
  Still, we need the 16.000$ to be able to get a professional crew and cast together, pay, feed and accomodate them during the month of our shoot! A happy team makes a great film! So this is exactly where your money will go to.  </p>
<p>We will be ever so thankful!</p>

</div>","CAST 


Morten Holst as David

Morten Holst - danish actor from movies like ""Brotherhood"", ""A Royal Affair"" has taken the lead part  “Dust”. Morten Holst on IMDB







STORY 
David’s girlfriend MUMTAZ has died. She was a photographer by profession, working in the

heartlands of central India. David is a German diplomat working in India since four years.
Still reeling from the loss, he travels to the city of her birth, a city that he has never visited before.
  
  Here, he seeks out DR. SHARDA, a cynical old man who could lead him to the place, buried in the
  
  interiors of the country, where Mumtaz last was.  
A journey into the heart of the country leads David simultaneously into its past. A past, it turns out,
  
  that binds the Doctor and Mumtaz. Dr. Sharda is revealed to be the commander of a camp, training
  
  young boys in combat against the State. Mumtaz, documenting the Doctor's camp, had captured
  
  the brutalization of one of its young inmates KRISHNA, at the hands of his own peers.

Mumtaz's searching spirit is reflected in another female character, RADHA, a young nurse working as a surrogate mother, whose longing to be independent is a quietly cherished dream. Radha's appearance in the film is independent of the other stories.That is, until we realise that she too had once existed within the structures of violence, of which the Doctor and his army were an integral part.
Drawing together these narratives, the film creates a multificated picture of present day India, a society in the throes of change, struggling to break the shackles of its past and emerge into the future. 





 DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT  
DUST is as much a story about a place as it is about its characters. Both place and character are

moulded by the process of transformation underway in Indian society today. Indore, the city of my

birth, has changed rapidly over the last decade and its transformation is not unlike that of other

small cities in India. Indore therefore provides an ideal setting for DUST.
In order to capture aspects of this ongoing transformation in its most authentic form, DUST will be

shot on real locations in and around Indore, using minimal lighting and production design. The

documentary style of shooting will also enable us to improvise scenes with actors and the

inhabitants of the city.



Any story about transformation must necessarily grapple with the concept of time.

And a story about transformation in India must grapple with an even more complex experience of

time. As one of the characters in the film points out: 
... in our language (Hindi), both the past and the future go by the same name - Kal...
What kind of transformation is possible in a culture in which conceptions of past and future might be inextricably linked?
This is a question that excited me from the beginning. This conception of time informs the

narrative structure of DUST. The past and future are intervowen seamlessly into the present,

touching each other in their progress. As with life, where one cannot hold apart the present, the

past, dream and memory from each other, so too is the movement between the different time layers

of the film­they flow into each other, connecting naturally during the course of the film.

  Doing so, the reality of the film provides room for the “contradictions” that surround us in India

everyday: a highly modern society, yet never far away from its past, a country of many histories,

existences, cultures, languages and constrasts, a land that exists simultaneously in different eras. 








INSPIRATION
The transformation in our society is being driven to a large extent by women. In my immediate

environment, I am surrounded by strong women, whose ideas have not only influenced me to write

DUST, but have also made me aware of a need to explore narrative structures that reflect women's

experiences and perceptions.
One such effort is DUST. Although beginning with a traditional narrative (man seeking his lost

love), DUST cracks open this conventional and exhausted narrative, enabling its female

characters to emerge, not as heroines or goddesses or larger (or lesser) than life figures, but a as

individuals steering through a complex and ever changing society. And like the world they

inhabit, they too are ever changing, adaptable figures.
 At the end of the film, Mumtaz, Radha and the other women characters in the film set off on a

journey, their path stretching out into the unknown but illuminated by their desire for freedom. It is

this movement of the female characters in my film that is the triumphant spirit of DUST.
 Thus David's encounter with an ageing partriachal world turns into a narrative embodying a fresh

hope: the hope that in these times of change, a new path forged by women in our society may

present an alternative to the structures of violence perpetuated throughout times.





WHY CROWD-FUNDING?
DUST is a low budget film, but it is 80% financed. However, we're missing the last critical stretch which will allow us to produce this independent film, fully shot in India. 
We've received money through a German Film Fund and the Film University Babelsberg will be supporting us with equipment and postproduction resources.
  Still, we need the 16.000$ to be able to get a professional crew and cast together, pay, feed and accomodate them during the month of our shoot! A happy team makes a great film! So this is exactly where your money will go to.  
We will be ever so thankful!

<p>Hello. My name is Michael

Life Ends at 30. The story revolves around an ensemble of people, led by David
who turns 30 at the start of the first season and his best friend Kyle, who has
just turned 30 a few months back. Both are faced with the idea of growing up
and both promptly flush it down the toilet.</p>
<p>This is comedy in the
vein of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, South Park, Trailer Parks Boys and The League, just to name
a few. It’s raw. It’s at the edge of the spectrum where pushing buttons is what
we’re going for. </p>
<p>The first season is 6
episodes, and we’re looking to raise money for the pilot.
We plan to shoot the pilot in late January, and the full season around April, but we need to show what we can do first.
This is where this campaign, and hopefully you, come in.</p>
<p>If you’d like to donate
to our project, please choose from any one of the packages listed on this page.
Any bit helps. The 5K is going towards the production costs of the shoot, which
willl be over a weekend in late January. Insurance, Food, Equipment Rental,
Location fees, Cast, etc.</p>
<p>If money is tight, no
worries. Please like our page on Facebook, follow us on twitter and Instagram. As
much as money is what we need right now, we also need fans. We need supporters.
Everyone counts.</p>

<p>We are a group of film students, artists and indie filmmakers working under the name
of <b>Oculophilia Films</b>. This short film will be the starting point to our future
production of various works; some to be hosted freely on the internet, and
hopefully others sent to festivals before starting to work on a feature film.  </p>
<p>As a
production company, our goal is to take the unknown talents of people in the
area and make them worthwhile on the screen. This rule applies for all of our

on.</p><p>We believe many of today's talents are hidden from the obvious sight, and finding them would mean making progress in the Mexican cinematographic industry.</p><p>After finishing this project, we will start the immediate production of new things (short films, videos for the web) and the planning of a feature film.<br/></p><p>---</p>

about perceiving the value of a person’s presence. It is a story about those
who go missing and cease to exist.  
The idea to the story comes from observing a
bulletin board with posters of missing persons, and wondering who they were
before their disappearance.. 




We are a group of film students, artists and indie filmmakers working under the name

production of various works; some to be hosted freely on the internet, and
hopefully others sent to festivals before starting to work on a feature film.

</h3>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>We're Chris and Emilee Danielson. This independent film is a total step of faith to give people a tool to defend their beliefs and has been an absolute miracle unfolding before our eyes. We want YOU to join us!</p><p> Even though we have been in ministry together for a long time, hosting syndicated radio shows, performing stand up/improv comedy and guest speaking in over 200 churches over the last decade, this project is what our heart is about. Over the last few years we’ve seen a sharp <b>increase in the rejection of God’s Word, the Bible</b>.  At the same time an increase in violence, crime, and the breakdown of family and community. Chris had a vision to blend stand up comedy (entertainment) with bible apologetics (education). </p>

We're Chris and Emilee Danielson. This independent film is a total step of faith to give people a tool to defend their beliefs and has been an absolute miracle unfolding before our eyes. We want YOU to join us! Even though we have been in ministry together for a long time, hosting syndicated radio shows, performing stand up/improv comedy and guest speaking in over 200 churches over the last decade, this project is what our heart is about. Over the last few years we’ve seen a sharp increase in the rejection of God’s Word, the Bible.  At the same time an increase in violence, crime, and the breakdown of family and community. Chris had a vision to blend stand up comedy (entertainment) with bible apologetics (education). 

So, against mighty odds and little funding, during our last comedy tour we went to God and asked Him to see this through. We obtained high end cameras and equipment, hired a small professional crew, and hit the road.  We talked to people across the country, from the educated elite to the man on the street, we wanted to find out: What do people honestly think about the Bible, and more importantly WHY?  What are the reasons people accept or reject God’s Word?  Do we have to throw reason and logic out the window in order to believe the Bible?  Is the Bible Provable?  We had to ask:  Are we IDIOTS for believing the Bible, or would we be IDIOTS not to?  

What we found was nothing less than miraculous.  Once we captured the footage, we knew we had something extraordinary that people needed to see.  By the hand of God, we have gotten enough funding to bring us this far.  We’ve done the comedy tour, captured the footage, and edited all down into an incredible, professional, full length reality documentary.  Unlike any other movie of it’s kind, we merged stand-up comedy with Bible apologetics for a uniquely humorous and engaging project.  

But as we have discovered, that was the easy part.  Now we enter the toughest challenge of the “Bible Idiots” project.  Getting it out and into the hands of people who truly want to hold onto and share their faith with a world that is increasingly hostile to the true Gospel of Jesus.  

We need your help to get the “Bible Idiots” documentary marketed and distributed.  We need your help to raise the awareness for Bible believers everywhere that there is a tool that will give them answers to common questions and objections to Christianity.  

What We Need:

Let’s be honest: 60k is less than the average catering budget for the average family film. We really need your help and you will make a huge difference.  Our next step is to promote and market this movie to get it into the hands of people who need it.  Your contributions will make that happen in a two different ways.

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For the last two years our team of co-workers decided to pool money to buy iPads for kids with disabilities. We purchased around 20 iPads and we were amazed at the success these kids experienced; they now have a voice. They can answer a question or ask one. They can comment on a story. They can tell if they are hungry or tired or sad and it helps with their motor skills.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461040424/image2_nsd7xf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 240.11999999999998px;height: 174px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We were beyond excited to see these results that we never imagined possible.  We knew the Ipads would be helpful but we never knew just how much freedom we were giving Autistic families and the change we were seeing unfold before our very eyes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This motivated us to create a non-profit to help more children to have the same experience, we take more care on the low income families, creating a non-profit would be easies way to ask for donations and rich a wider population of children with ASD.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461040548/image3_mthgx7.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>The CFO for Autism Needs You, Juan Marin has first-hand experience with autism spectrum disorders. The inspiration for our organization came to John after he spent years watching his sister’s autistic son struggle every day with the condition. His nephew faced insurmountable behavioral issues, major sensory issues, an inability to cope with the environment. Setting out to help in any way possible, John took it upon himself to read everything he could about helping autistic children. Through education, patience, and military precision, John’s sister and family are now leading a happier life, despite the challenges that autism presents them with. After this experience, John decided to reach out to other families with the same situation, first by spreading awareness and then by donating iPads with apps and designs that help autistic children improve their motor skills.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new data on the prevalence of autism in the United States. This surveillance study identified 1 in 68 children (1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls) as having autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This number is surpassing 2% of boys in the US.  This number is huge.  Too many families are struggling.  A symptom of autism is verbal and nonverbal communication problems.

<p>
</p>
<p>“The iPad revolutionized and unlocked the communication barrier for children on the spectrum. The iPad gives a voice to the voiceless. The iPad apps for autism are easy-to-use, and allow for children to put words and symbols together and eventually create sentences using images.”</p>

necessity in early June 2014 - our founder was walking in a pair of 3 week old
Havaianas when the front plug pulled through the sole plate. Persevering with
them for another week he began to think there must be a better way. IBIZA SOUL
was born. He wanted to make a flip flop that had better build quality and
durability and in addition to create a brand that induced an emotional connection between our products and the magical island of IBIZA.</span></p>

their outfits but ultimately the choice of supplier for Ibiza Soul's first

<br/><p>If you don’t ask you don’t get! On a tip from a friend I emailed a contact at the company in LA that is responsible for the Swag bags at the Oscars. </p>
<p>Long story short - they came back saying they would love to include our flip flops in the 2015 Swag bags. I was sent a list of all the nominees foot sizes and made individual packs and shipped them off from Ibiza to LA. We received a great deal of press for the brand in LA, locally in Spain and in the UK.</p>

<p><b>1. SUBMISSION</b></p>
<p>Artists of all types can register to become a IBIZA SOUL artist. After completing your profile, you can submit an unlimited number of artwork.</p>
<h4>2. REVIEW</h4>
<p>We review your submission, taking into account quality, originality, story, and trends. Designs that pass our initial review are sampled and tested to determine which styles make it.</p>
<h4>3. PRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Your design made the cut? Our product designers will finalise materials, silhouettes, and packaging for your design, which we manufacture into a shoe to be sold all over the world.</p>
<h4>4. LAUNCH</h4>
<p>We promote your flip flop on IBIZASOUL.ES, across all of our social media channels, and to retailers around the world. You earn royalties on every sale and there is no limit to the amount you can earn.</p>In the near future we are looking to move into other related items for Ibiza beach life.. like towels, bags, hats, t shirts and sunglasses.. all of which we will eligible for our registered artists to contribute to and design... <br/>

</div></div>","Short Summary Thanks for taking the time to view our campaign.. We are new flip flop company based on the island of IBIZA in the Mediterranean Sea. 
To be clear from the outset.. WE have funded everything to date involved in the birth & development of IBIZA SOUL entirely on our own (so far 130,000 euros) WE need your help to keep the wheels turning, to fund design, production, sales and to develop our artist registry program (more on this below). WE aren’t using your hard earned cash to fund dodgy trips around the world or to party in Ibiza!  – WE are
going straight for what makes us tingle - designing and producing beautiful flip flops, helping local artists and making their art
wearable..


Ibiza Soul was born out of
necessity in early June 2014 - our founder was walking in a pair of 3 week old
Havaianas when the front plug pulled through the sole plate. Persevering with
them for another week he began to think there must be a better way. IBIZA SOUL
was born. He wanted to make a flip flop that had better build quality and
durability and in addition to create a brand that induced an emotional connection between our products and the magical island of IBIZA.


By mid-June he was in China, in a city called
Quanzhou, an hour north of Xiamen. He Googled flip flop manufacturers, emailed them all, picked the best 5 (based on how professional their websites looked and how well they responded to English emails) and instructed them to prepare samples.
         
Once out in China he met them and saw
their outfits but ultimately the choice of supplier for Ibiza Soul's first
production run came down to the quality of their samples. Staying in China on this visit for nearly 3
weeks, he had them remake the samples several times until he was happy to pull the trigger on a run our very first production run of 11,000 pairs.



                


     

BLOWOUTS
One of the problems we wanted to address in flip flops available at the time was the front plug 'blowout'. 
We came up with a very simple yet effective solution.. All of our flip flops feature our front plug stabiliser that spreads the surface area of the plug and helps prevent the common blowout. 

            
We have had customers come back wearing the flip flops they bought the previous year with no blowouts.. We are onto something!

The Team
Below is the current range, all of which contain images of Ibiza & our neighbour Formentera. They are great quality and extremely comfortable making them a desirable option for tourists, locals and international customers all over the globe.


        
    BARRACUDAS       JETTY BLUE        SUNSET ORANGE     MIGHTY WAKES

            CALA BASSA Y       JETTY GREEN         CALA BASSA W       SUNSET PINK
In total this year we are in 38 outlets on Ibiza and so far 4 off the island in Mallorca, Holland, the UK and Australia. 
Oscars
      
    
If you don’t ask you don’t get! On a tip from a friend I emailed a contact at the company in LA that is responsible for the Swag bags at the Oscars. 
Long story short - they came back saying they would love to include our flip flops in the 2015 Swag bags. I was sent a list of all the nominees foot sizes and made individual packs and shipped them off from Ibiza to LA. We received a great deal of press for the brand in LA, locally in Spain and in the UK.

In order to grow and explore the Brand potential we need your help.
Firstly, we have a collaborated over the winter with an amazing artist on the island named Chapter - he is a well known dj and artist and has come up with 4 incredible designs for our flip flops which you can see below.. 
www.chapter-art.com

           
             
                                                                                          SKULLS                                                  EYEBALLS

              
                      CARNIVAL                                              BUTTERFLY                          




Secondly, as a result of our collaboration with Chapter we have come up with a plan to create an interactive website whereby artists like Chapter can register and submit their work for review. We would then (if their design is selected for a production run) pay them a set fee and in addition a % of all sales of flip flops that feature their design.

1. SUBMISSION
Artists of all types can register to become a IBIZA SOUL artist. After completing your profile, you can submit an unlimited number of artwork.
2. REVIEW
We review your submission, taking into account quality, originality, story, and trends. Designs that pass our initial review are sampled and tested to determine which styles make it.
3. PRODUCTION
Your design made the cut? Our product designers will finalise materials, silhouettes, and packaging for your design, which we manufacture into a shoe to be sold all over the world.
4. LAUNCH
We promote your flip flop on IBIZASOUL.ES, across all of our social media channels, and to retailers around the world. You earn royalties on every sale and there is no limit to the amount you can earn.In the near future we are looking to move into other related items for Ibiza beach life.. like towels, bags, hats, t shirts and sunglasses.. all of which we will eligible for our registered artists to contribute to and design... 




                                 

In brief that is why we need you! We really want to involve this amazing island and its people in the brand and make it possible for people living here to contribute and help us to grow while giving back to our community - that way we can all grow together and IBIZA SOUL can really be the SOUL of Ibiza.



   
What We Need & What You Get The target number I have specified of 35,000 euros will be spent predominantly on manufacturing, marketing and building the designer registry into our website. We also need to take on some staff to help with admin and sourcing distribution agents in our target markets all over the globe. 

     

PERKS PERKS PERKS!!! We have some exciting ideas for rewarding you for your help. You can have our Chapter range before anyone else, BIG discounts on current ranges, custom design your own amazing pair of Ibiza Souls, wholesale packages and for the very generous and special investor we have something in mind that will really give you an idea of how amazing our island is.. read on to find out more..

If we don't reach our ultimate goal we will simply reduce the order for this season and manufacture as many pairs as we can with the funds available.

become stranded hundreds of miles from civilization. Secrets and lies quickly force
them to be suspicious of each other's intentions. They soon discover that they are not

<p><b>A message from the Screenwriter:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>""Writing is a process of self-discovery. Over a year ago I came up with a small concept that would become my film, <b>The Last</b>. At that time, however, it was envisioned as an artistic short film. That would soon change due to some advice from Bruce Campbell’s book <i>If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor</i>.  The book planted a seed that led the short to evolve into a feature film.  After that moment the story also began to evolve into something completely different. As each day passed, I had no clue what was going to transpire in the script. This is not how I usually write scripts. Most of the time I come up with the climax and work my way backwards. This story revolves around a terminally ill man and his final days on Earth. Then he encounters a monster. Lies, mysteries, and the mortality that we will all face are explored in the darkness of the woods from which there seems to be no escape. We could really use your help to make this picture. If you are able to participate with us in making The Last, I know you will be very proud of the final product.""  </p>

STORY: A terminally ill man spends his last days coping with death and struggles to undo his
past sins. While headed to a remote location he stumbles upon a woman. The two
become stranded hundreds of miles from civilization. Secrets and lies quickly force
them to be suspicious of each other's intentions. They soon discover that they are not
alone. Something dark lives in the woods. Something not human and when it arrives
there will be no survivors in its wake.
The movie will be a throwback to classic horror films like The Evil Dead (1981) and the Universal
Monster movies of the 1930s-50s. It contains elements of a Hitchcock thriller and at the same
time delves into the mystery of a Michael Crichton novel. At the core of the film, it explores the
darkest corners of fear and horror as it follows a manʼs journey through the last moments of his
life. What would you do if your time was up? 











A message from the Screenwriter:


""Writing is a process of self-discovery. Over a year ago I came up with a small concept that would become my film, The Last. At that time, however, it was envisioned as an artistic short film. That would soon change due to some advice from Bruce Campbell’s book If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor.  The book planted a seed that led the short to evolve into a feature film.  After that moment the story also began to evolve into something completely different. As each day passed, I had no clue what was going to transpire in the script. This is not how I usually write scripts. Most of the time I come up with the climax and work my way backwards. This story revolves around a terminally ill man and his final days on Earth. Then he encounters a monster. Lies, mysteries, and the mortality that we will all face are explored in the darkness of the woods from which there seems to be no escape. We could really use your help to make this picture. If you are able to participate with us in making The Last, I know you will be very proud of the final product.""

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The purpose behind Deserted is to bring awareness to the seven sins. The show is not a biblically based show, but  is to demonstrate the seven deadly sins that we encounter in our day to day lives. While researching for the script, Director Quentin Washington, had a conversation with an individual who expressed a situation that happened to him. Quentin was taken away and shared a few lines from the script with the individual, about the same incident that happened to the Character in the script.  So if this individual  was able to identify and relate to the story. The viewers at home can also relate.</p>

<p>      Je suis Arnaud Lanouiller, aka Arno Momtché, un jeune français originaire d’un
petit village normand de la Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel. Jusqu'ici, j'étais cadreur ou monteur vidéo. Souvent amené à travailler seul sur différents projets, l'étape de la réalisation m'est déterminante pour le désir de créer en équipe, de partager les points de vue pour en extraire ce qui semble être une bonne direction. Le cinéma documentaire, en tant que transmission subjective de savoir, m'est un choix essentiel, refléter le réel en art, en tirer un enseignement, puis le transmettre sous une forme qui aujourd'hui utilise le récit de voyage et d'expérience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>      Il y a deux ans et demi, l'ambition était de réaliser mon premier long métrage. Alors, je suis parti en vadrouille, seul, sinon avec ma voiture, parcourir les routes escarpées des Balkans pour découvrir de nouvelles musiques. Pourquoi les Balkans me direz-vous ? Car de ce que j'en connaissais, il y avait un trop large fossé entre Goran Bregovic de Serbie et le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, puis ses fanfares, ce balkans beat, ces sensations tziganes qui traversaient les frontières pour venir jusqu'à moi, jusqu'à nous. <br/>     </p>
<p>     Je ne comprenais pas et j'ai voulu savoir.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>                                            «  Rien n’est plus chargé
d’associations émotionnelles que la                             musique, rien n’est mieux qu’elle
susceptible de recréer des situations                          engageant toute la sensibilité de l’être.
Elle instaure à la fois un état                                intérieur et rapports avec le monde où l’affectivité
prédomine.» </i><span style=""background-color: initial;font-style: normal;"">Gilbert                           ROUGET, La musique et la transe, Gallimard, 1990</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>      Alors, je me décrirais plutôt comme quelqu'un qui souhaite vous
raconter son histoire entremêlée de celle des autres. Et je ne sais sous quelle langue je devrais vous la raconter, peut-être en français ou en anglais, en macédonien, en bulgare ou en bosniaque. J'utiliserais le langage du cinéma et celui de leurs musiques.<br/></p>

Dina Koleva, Crieuse et Leader de l'ensemble Bistrichki Babi (BG)

     A Current Past est un long métrage documentaire. Un film qui se dessine sur différents modes d'expression dans le but d'extérioriser différents modes de pensée, différentes pratiques. Coller à l'immense variété musicale présente et aux personnes qui les perdurent pour être aussi représentatif que possible des univers proposés et de la vision du réalisateur. Un film qui est entré dans la dernière année de sa réalisation. Deux ans et demi de repérages, recherches et écritures. Et face à une multitude de choses à dire, le film se dirige vers plusieurs thèmes :


                         Le voyage et la rencontre contre les préjugés                                 L'importance de l'identité culturelle                      La sauvegarde et la réadaptation du patrimoine        La musique traditionnelle comme véhicule de grandes valeurs




        La méthode de réalisation restera simple, humble et contemplative. Le discours sonore est construit par les intervenants et les captations sur place. L'auteur parle avec l'image et le montage. Une mise en perspective des décors, lieux, villes ou montagnes, installe les sociétés dans leurs présents, pose le contexte socio-culturel. Le geste musical, les respirations et temps morts explorent les différentes personnalités présentes. La mise en abîme via la présence du dispositif filmique, le tournage est dévoilé dans son honnêteté comme une simple réplique: ""Nous y sommes allé pour vivre une expérience unique."" Je quadrille la zone de recherche à trois de ces merveilleux pays :



La Bulgarie pour son large patrimoine traditionnel, ses ensembles folkloriques, ses chœurs de voix féminins, ses somptueuses montagnes. 


La Bosnie-Herzégovine pour sa sevdalinka typique (genre musical national), d'hier et d'aujourd'hui, son talent artistique pour une sevdah qui part du cœur et qui parle aux cœurs.


La République de Macédoine pour tout ce qu'elle offre, ces festivals, son style de vie, son patrimoine de musiques urbaines et pastorales, de ceux qui en recherchent les différentes réadaptations puis ceux qui participent à sa transmission.

Souvent amené à travailler seul sur différents projets, l'étape de la réalisation m'est déterminante pour le désir de créer en équipe, de partager les points de vue pour en extraire ce qui semble être une bonne direction. Le cinéma documentaire, en tant que transmission subjective de savoir, m'est un choix essentiel, refléter le réel en art, en tirer un enseignement, puis le transmettre sous une forme qui aujourd'hui utilise le récit de voyage et d'expérience.

      Il y a deux ans et demi, l'ambition était de réaliser mon premier long métrage. Alors, je suis parti en vadrouille, seul, sinon avec ma voiture, parcourir les routes escarpées des Balkans pour découvrir de nouvelles musiques. Pourquoi les Balkans me direz-vous ? Car de ce que j'en connaissais, il y avait un trop large fossé entre Goran Bregovic de Serbie et le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, puis ses fanfares, ce balkans beat, ces sensations tziganes qui traversaient les frontières pour venir jusqu'à moi, jusqu'à nous.      
     Je ne comprenais pas et j'ai voulu savoir.



                                            «  Rien n’est plus chargé
d’associations émotionnelles que la                             musique, rien n’est mieux qu’elle
susceptible de recréer des situations                          engageant toute la sensibilité de l’être.
Elle instaure à la fois un état                                intérieur et rapports avec le monde où l’affectivité
prédomine.» Gilbert                           ROUGET, La musique et la transe, Gallimard, 1990

      Alors, je me décrirais plutôt comme quelqu'un qui souhaite vous
raconter son histoire entremêlée de celle des autres. Et je ne sais sous quelle langue je devrais vous la raconter, peut-être en français ou en anglais, en macédonien, en bulgare ou en bosniaque. J'utiliserais le langage du cinéma et celui de leurs musiques.


     
      Sur un budget de 18.000€, excluant les frais de repérage, la collecte de crowdfunding représente 27% des revenus finaux. L'argent collecté financera le prochain et dernier tournage qui aura lieu en septembre 2016, frais de déplacement, hébergement, nourriture pour toute l'équipe sur une période de trois semaine. J'aimerais aussi investir dans du matériel, passer à l'utilisation de la BlackMagic Cinema Camera dont la version Pocket m'a démontré un rendu à la hauteur de mes attentes esthétiques.

       Jovana Backovic est née à Belgrade en Serbie où elle a été diplômée à la faculté d'art musical en 2006. À côté de ces études elle fonde, organise, guide et compose pour le groupe ""Arhai"" qui se trouve être un mélange d'électro folk orchestré qui développe une fusion des musiques traditionnelles des Balkans avec des sons d'ambiances influencés de jazz, improvisations, utilisant des flûtes classique, un piano, des guitares électriques, basses et autres percussion, en accompagnant le tout de son chant. 


    


     Ici, la formule de campagne crowdfunding est basée sur un système flexible. Toute donation est comptabilisée même si l'objectif n'est pas atteint. Le choix est qu'il me faut écarter le risque zéro et que la moindre petite somme a son importance. En tant que donateur, vous offrez la possibilité à de jeunes artistes de s'exprimer et dans le cas présent, vous permettez à ce projet de film d'aller jusqu'à son aboutissement dans les meilleures conditions et surtout, vous vous inscrivez dans la liste des personnes m'ayant soutenu au moment où il le fallait.

Location, this part of the budget is so we can all get there.
Meals - Because we can't have
hungry Cast and Crew.
Facilities - The location we
are filming at does not have a working toilet so we are hiring a portable
toilet for the duration of the filming.Festivals We are very keen to enter this short into some Film Festivals to raise awareness of our company, ourselves and more importantly the industry in Hull and East Yorkshire.
We
have developed the perks so you can have a piece of the film and be involved in
the promotion. It is very important to us that you enjoy the art work and the
concept of the film.
This
is our first steps towards creating more films, The Bagpipe Maker's Baby is our
baby and our debut as a film making group.
Our aim is to develop our Company, Dead Bod
Films and contribute to the small film industry in Hull and East Yorkshire.
There is a lot of talent and professionals here that have a passion for the art
of film but it’s only a small industry, we want to make it grow and be
more recognized within the UK.
Currently we have a company, called Double
Click, supporting us by working on our website and branding that we will add in here once it
is finished.",24.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Introduction 
 My name is Taylor Reynolds and I'm a Digital Arts major at Chapman University emphasizing in Animation. I am the director, writer, and story artist for AKI, my 3D animated senior thesis film which will be  ​screened in May 2017. The film will be entirely in Japanese, with English subtitles.

With the help of my producer, Aidan Wood, I have created this campaign to help fund the production of this film and enable the production team to create the story we have set in motion. 


What is the story of AKI? 

AKI is set in Edo-period Japan, around the  mid 1700's.
​Kiyo, a  young servant girl working for a merchant family in the city of Kyoto, is living away from her family in the country while she earns wages to bring home. Her daily life consists of chores given to her by the wife of the merchant, called Master, who orders her around with strictness and high expectations. One day, Kiyo comes across an injured stray dog in an alleyway in town. They become fast friends, and are no longer alone in the world. Kiyo names the dog Aki, meaning Autumn, after the season in which they met. She has to be careful to conceal her new friend from her master, and plans to take Aki with her when she's saved enough money to return home. Seasons change from fall to winter. A chance encounter in an alleyway with a nasty rogue samurai, the Ronin, changes Kiyo and Aki's  fate . Kiyo is forced to confront her beliefs in good fortune,  or make the biggest sacrifice of her life. 
Where will my funding go? 

Funding for AKI will be primarily used towards supplemental talent and freelance work aiding the production of this film. The most notable roles include:



A composer. To give this film the emotional, poignant score it deserves, we will be working with a professional film composer to write the music for AKI. 

Voice actors. We are lucky to have the talented voices of professional actors and actresses giving life to the characters of AKI, and this funding will be used to supplement their payment as the cast of a student film. 

Freelance animators. As an animation emphasis, I plan on covering the majority of animation myself. However, the ability to bring on 1 or 2 freelance animators to assist with the workload will allow for more passes and refinement of the more technical sequences. 

Rigging. I am already in contact with a professional rigger to assist with this technical and intensive aspect of 3D animation. Your funding will help me pay for this service and more quickly expedite the production of functional 3D characters. 


As the director and artistic lead of the film, I will be taking on the majority of the workload, which includes design, modeling, texturing, set dressing, previs, animation, compositing, and rendering. However, this funding will allow me to connect with fellow artists and talent to assist with the production, resulting in a smoother pipeline and the high-caliber polish of a multi-person endeavor. Additionally, this film will be worked on by multiple students in my program, helping to make this a collaborative educational process.

   Risks & Challenges 
 With every animated production, the biggest challenge is time and time management. With assets like the Asana project coordinator and a production hierarchy managing output and freelance collaboration, the AKI team is prepared to create a dynamic production schedule that prepares us to effectively complete the film while leaving room for flexibility and adjustment. Any amount of contribution will make a difference in our pipeline and will expedite the efforts needed to comfortably complete this film.

</div></div>","About the Project

The Ice Bullet helps you pack a smarter cooler by freezing your beer to replace ice allowing you to pack more of what you love. By encapsulating the weakest part of the can and allowing room for expansion at the concave bottom you can avoid the explosion. The Ice Bullet lasts longer than ice so you can keep your cooler colder longer. 



How it Started





The concept came from Zack's annual rafting trip in Idaho. Trying to keep beer cold until the last day where temperatures can reach 100+ degrees is nearly impossible. To keep the beer cold until the last day the beer would have to be colder from the start or use more ice. Using more ice wasn't an option because of limited cooler space and freezing the cans would cause them to explode in the freezer. After three days in the hot sun, Zack thought that by containing the weakest part of the can and exploiting the concave bottom would allow the cans to freeze without exploding.

How it was Developed






Back home from Idaho, Zack shared his idea with Joe which led to some interesting proof of concept experiments. We started with cardboard boxes and concrete - there were a few can explosions, but thankfully no one was injured. After the general concept was proven, Zack built an epoxy fixture which allowed for repeatable trials. After a summer of data collection Zack finalized drawings for the Ice Bullet tool build.


Progress
 Our tool arrived in April 2016. We have selected our US manufacturer and material suppliers and are ready to run production. After the campaign we will place the order and the manufacturer will start producing. Deliveries will start in July.  
How to Use the Ice Bullet

Simply place your beer upside down in the base, twist to lock, and freeze.

The Burden of Emotional Disorders
We're developing medicine to be faster, more effective, and safer than currently available drugs for anxiety and depression. Our goal is to extinguish these mental illnesses whenever they pop up, not just mask their symptoms briefly. Anxiety and depression
cause a million deaths each year, and are major causes of disability and
susceptibility to other illnesses. Antidepressants and anxiolytics help some
people, but millions do not respond to antidepressants, and long-term use of
anxiolytics is addictive and harmful to the brain.  
What is Akhu Therapeutics Doing Differently?
We're developing  melanocortin blockers, and our they work extremely well. Decades ago 1st- and 2nd-generation melanocortin blockers
were shown to be 3X more effective, 8X faster acting, and 10X less likely to cause side
effects as antidepressants. Our 3rd-generation melanocortin blockers are 3X
more effective and 1,000X faster acting than antidepressants without side
effects in proven animal models. With your help, we will prepare our medicine to test in humans. Because our medicine is biodegradable, it is highly unlikely to harm the environment. In contrast, anxiolytics and antidepressants remain active outside the body. So, they enter waterways and harm fish and other aquatic animals.

Il relate l'histoire d'Orphée, une femme d'âge mûre atteinte d'Alzheimer qui choisit de lutter contre la maladie en vivant ses derniers moments au jour le jour comme une jeune femme libre, pétillante et pleine de fougue.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></em></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Orphée est une femme touchée par le syndrome de Peter Pan. Elle est jeune, elle est âgée, elle est éternelle. De sa vie elle regrette peu de choses, de sa vie elle n'oublie rien. À 75 ans, alors qu'elle respire encore la jeunesse à plein poumons, un médecin lui annonce une nouvelle dramatique: elle est atteinte d'Alzheimer. Loin d'être prête à affronter la maladie, Orphée choisit de lutter jusqu'à ne plus en avoir le pouvoir, contre l'anéantissement de son être et de son âme et de profiter de chaque instant avant la fin de sa vie. Elle est déterminée à vivre plus libre qu'elle ne l'a jamais été, à vivre au jour le jour, à profiter sans retenue, sans hier ni lendemain. Elle va choisir de vivre la vie d'une jeune adulte survoltée à une époque marquée par un culte de la jeunesse et des nouvelles générations superficielles et laxistes. Tandis qu'elle tente de se faire une place au coeur de l'effervescence parisienne des bars, de la musique et des jeunes, sa mémoire s'efface un peu plus chaque jour bien qu'elle refuse de l'accepter. Elle allume et ré-allume la flamme de sa jeunesse jusqu'à ce que sa démence prenne le dessus. Elle goûte une dernière fois à l'ardeur de la débauche, l'incandescence du désir, la brûlante envie de renaître et les élans de liberté. Une histoire sans génération, sans âge, sans jugement, en somme l'histoire d'une vie qui rayonne avant l'éblouissement.</p><p><u><strong>À l'origine de l'idée</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Le désir de réaliser ce projet est né de l'envie d'aborder plusieurs thèmes sociaux tels que la place et l'évolution de la jeunesse et du troisième âge dans le temps et ainsi mettre en avant l'existence d'un gouffre particulièrement notable entre ces deux générations d'individus.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">J'ai choisis d'aborder le thème de la maladie d'Alzheimer, une maladie bien connue mais peu comprise et de faire vivre au spectateur l'expérience de la maladie afin de le sensibiliser, en un sens, à celle ci </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">en </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">combinant alternativement un regard objectif et subjectif posé sur notre personnage principal.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Le choix de mettre en scène au premier plan des personnages d'âge mûr n'est pas un hasard. Cette idée me vint immédiatement après avoir vu la série de photo ""Forever Love"" réalisée par Tom Ford dans laquelle il présente un homme et une femme âgés de plus de 70 ans s'embrassant fougueusement et sensuellement comme des jeunes personnes de 20 ans. Le commentaire qu'il fit à propos de cette série de photographies fût ""Je suis fatigué par le culte de la jeunesse. Le rejet culturel de la vieillesse, la stigmatisation des rides, des cheveux gris, du corps sillonné par les années. Je suis fasciné par Diane Vreeland, Georgia O'Keeffe ou Louise Bourgeois, des femmes qui ont laissé le temps les étreindre sans jamais tricher. La société d'aujourd'hui condamne ça, moi je le célèbre"". Immédiatement je voulu réaliser un film qui illustrerait ces dires en un conte philosophique qui aurait pour message que le désir et la passion n'ont pas d'âge et qu'il faut profiter de chaque moment avant qu'une fatalité telle que l'oubli ne vienne nous dévorer. </span><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>LES PERSONNAGES</strong></u></p><ul><li><strong><u>Orphée</u></strong></li></ul><p>Elle sera joué par Astrid D.

À son âge, Orphée détient toujours un charme et une élégance qui ne laisseront personne indifférent. Elle reniera la maladie tant qu'il lui sera possible et luttera pour sa liberté jusqu'au bout. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-cke-saved-src=""https://drfhlmcehrc34.cloudfront.net/cache/7/1/e755e77686ed85c842680fb268a41d.jpg"" data-src=""https://drfhlmcehrc34.cloudfront.net/cache/7/1/e755e77686ed85c842680fb268a41d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul><li><u><strong>Tristan</strong></u></li></ul><p>Le fils unique d'Orphée, joué par Guillaume Gaudfrin.

<p></p>Sofia Barandiaran, étudiante en Cinéma à la Sorbonne Nouvelle s'intéresse dès son plus jeune âge au monde de l'art qui la fascine autant qu'il l'intrigue. Elle débute la photographie à l'âge de 14 ans et petit à petit apprend, évolue et se perfectionne en la matière essayant de trouver le style qui lui correspond et de se faire une place dans ce vaste univers. Plus tard elle s'intéresse au cinéma, un langage que l'on peut, selon elle, plus amplement utiliser pour faire passer des messages forts et engagés. Elle se met à écrire ses propres scénarios, à les réaliser et à les photographier. Petit à petit son regard sur le monde change et elle s'intéresse à un cinéma engagé et au documentaire. Ses photographies et ses écrits reflètent aujourd'hui ses idéaux et les messages qu'elle veut faire passer à propos des thèmes sociaux qui la touchent. <br/><p></p>

Il y a 8 ans il s'installe pour vivre à Paris et travaille alternativement entre La France et l'Italie sur des projets sociaux. Il suit des études d'Histoire du cinéma à l'université de Pavia en Italie et ce cursus lui permet de développer sa passion pour la photographie dans le domaine de l'audiovisuel. Depuis 2005 il contribue alors à de nombreux projets cinématographiques en tant que caméraman et chef-opérateur.</div>

</div></div>","PRÉSENTATION DU PROJETL'éphémère est un court-métrage qui s'inscrit dans le genre de la comédie-dramatique avec un arrière goût de cinéma expérimental. Il relate l'histoire d'Orphée, une femme d'âge mûre atteinte d'Alzheimer qui choisit de lutter contre la maladie en vivant ses derniers moments au jour le jour comme une jeune femme libre, pétillante et pleine de fougue.SYNOPSISOrphée est une femme touchée par le syndrome de Peter Pan. Elle est jeune, elle est âgée, elle est éternelle. De sa vie elle regrette peu de choses, de sa vie elle n'oublie rien. À 75 ans, alors qu'elle respire encore la jeunesse à plein poumons, un médecin lui annonce une nouvelle dramatique: elle est atteinte d'Alzheimer. Loin d'être prête à affronter la maladie, Orphée choisit de lutter jusqu'à ne plus en avoir le pouvoir, contre l'anéantissement de son être et de son âme et de profiter de chaque instant avant la fin de sa vie. Elle est déterminée à vivre plus libre qu'elle ne l'a jamais été, à vivre au jour le jour, à profiter sans retenue, sans hier ni lendemain. Elle va choisir de vivre la vie d'une jeune adulte survoltée à une époque marquée par un culte de la jeunesse et des nouvelles générations superficielles et laxistes. Tandis qu'elle tente de se faire une place au coeur de l'effervescence parisienne des bars, de la musique et des jeunes, sa mémoire s'efface un peu plus chaque jour bien qu'elle refuse de l'accepter. Elle allume et ré-allume la flamme de sa jeunesse jusqu'à ce que sa démence prenne le dessus. Elle goûte une dernière fois à l'ardeur de la débauche, l'incandescence du désir, la brûlante envie de renaître et les élans de liberté. Une histoire sans génération, sans âge, sans jugement, en somme l'histoire d'une vie qui rayonne avant l'éblouissement.À l'origine de l'idéeLe désir de réaliser ce projet est né de l'envie d'aborder plusieurs thèmes sociaux tels que la place et l'évolution de la jeunesse et du troisième âge dans le temps et ainsi mettre en avant l'existence d'un gouffre particulièrement notable entre ces deux générations d'individus.J'ai choisis d'aborder le thème de la maladie d'Alzheimer, une maladie bien connue mais peu comprise et de faire vivre au spectateur l'expérience de la maladie afin de le sensibiliser, en un sens, à celle ci en combinant alternativement un regard objectif et subjectif posé sur notre personnage principal.Le choix de mettre en scène au premier plan des personnages d'âge mûr n'est pas un hasard. Cette idée me vint immédiatement après avoir vu la série de photo ""Forever Love"" réalisée par Tom Ford dans laquelle il présente un homme et une femme âgés de plus de 70 ans s'embrassant fougueusement et sensuellement comme des jeunes personnes de 20 ans. Le commentaire qu'il fit à propos de cette série de photographies fût ""Je suis fatigué par le culte de la jeunesse. Le rejet culturel de la vieillesse, la stigmatisation des rides, des cheveux gris, du corps sillonné par les années. Je suis fasciné par Diane Vreeland, Georgia O'Keeffe ou Louise Bourgeois, des femmes qui ont laissé le temps les étreindre sans jamais tricher. La société d'aujourd'hui condamne ça, moi je le célèbre"". Immédiatement je voulu réaliser un film qui illustrerait ces dires en un conte philosophique qui aurait pour message que le désir et la passion n'ont pas d'âge et qu'il faut profiter de chaque moment avant qu'une fatalité telle que l'oubli ne vienne nous dévorer. LES PERSONNAGESOrphéeElle sera joué par Astrid D. C'est une femme pétillante qui connu quelques heures de gloire en tant qu'actrice au cours de sa jeunesse puis abandonna ce rêve pour celui de la maternité. Elle voua le reste de sa vie à élever son fils et à lui donner tout l'amour dont elle débordait pour qu'il grandisse vite et s'épanouisse pleinement. À son âge, Orphée détient toujours un charme et une élégance qui ne laisseront personne indifférent. Elle reniera la maladie tant qu'il lui sera possible et luttera pour sa liberté jusqu'au bout. TristanLe fils unique d'Orphée, joué par Guillaume Gaudfrin. C'est un jeune homme d'une trentaine d'années très maîtrisé qui se retrouve dans une position délicate à cette période de la vie de sa mère. Après avoir longtemps vécu à l'écart, peut être trop indépendamment d'elle il est très affecté par l'annonce de sa maladie. La relation mère-fils s'inversera dans le sens où Tristan jouera le rôle du protecteur et Orphée de l'inévitable insouciance.CésarUn homme du même âge qu'Orphée qu'elle rencontrera lors de l'un de ses périples dans les bars parisiens. Chic et mystérieusement envoutant il attirera le regard d'Orphée. Il sera l'allégorie du désir et de l'amour passionné qu'Orphée veut encore vivre. Tout deux s'enivreront de passion l'un pour l'autre le temps d'une courte aventure amoureuse.Le médecinJoué par Jeff Decaux, le médecin, ferme et rassurant jouera le rôle décisif de poser d'emblée le sujet du court-métrage en présentant à Orphée et à son fils la maladie et ses conséquences. L'ESTHÉTIQUE Le court métrage sera tourné à l'aide de la caméra Black Magic 2,5K. Une caméra de très bonne qualité afin de pouvoir jouer sur des contrastes et garder des couleurs lumineuses et des ombres subtiles. Nous combinerons alternativement points de vue objectif et subjectif afin de faire ressentir au spectateur l'expérience de la maladie vécue de l'intérieur. Le montage, dynamique, alternera flash-backs et techniques expérimentales. LA MUSIQUELa bande originale du court-métrage est une création du duo de compositeurs Solly Brown Stone. Ces deux jeunes musiciens composent ensemble depuis leur plus jeune âge. Leur genre s'inscrit dans celui du rock/électronique. Leur sonorité qui rime avec fraîcheur et dynamisme renforcera l'atmosphère colorée et pétillante du film. https://www.facebook.com/SollyBrownstone/?fref=ts
Le groupe Technicolor apporte également sa griffe musicale au film. Un rock progressif avec sa touche expérimentale qui s'accorde à cette même caractéristique du film créant une ambiance planante au travers de notes pensées et réfléchies qui amène celui qui l'écoute à l'évasion.

L'ÉQUIPE

La scénariste et réalisatrice: 
Sofia Barandiaran, étudiante en Cinéma à la Sorbonne Nouvelle s'intéresse dès son plus jeune âge au monde de l'art qui la fascine autant qu'il l'intrigue. Elle débute la photographie à l'âge de 14 ans et petit à petit apprend, évolue et se perfectionne en la matière essayant de trouver le style qui lui correspond et de se faire une place dans ce vaste univers. Plus tard elle s'intéresse au cinéma, un langage que l'on peut, selon elle, plus amplement utiliser pour faire passer des messages forts et engagés. Elle se met à écrire ses propres scénarios, à les réaliser et à les photographier. Petit à petit son regard sur le monde change et elle s'intéresse à un cinéma engagé et au documentaire. Ses photographies et ses écrits reflètent aujourd'hui ses idéaux et les messages qu'elle veut faire passer à propos des thèmes sociaux qui la touchent.

Le chef opérateur: 
Matteo Pellegrinuzzi, il tombe amoureux de la photographie lorsqu'il prend sa première photo à l'âge de 4 ans. Il acquis son premier appareil photo à l'âge de 6 ans. À 14 ans il a le droit à sa première publication. À partir de 2002 ses photographies seront publiées dans la presse et il travaillera pour de nombreux magazines et journaux importants. Il y a 8 ans il s'installe pour vivre à Paris et travaille alternativement entre La France et l'Italie sur des projets sociaux. Il suit des études d'Histoire du cinéma à l'université de Pavia en Italie et ce cursus lui permet de développer sa passion pour la photographie dans le domaine de l'audiovisuel. Depuis 2005 il contribue alors à de nombreux projets cinématographiques en tant que caméraman et chef-opérateur.

L'assistant réalisateur: 
Jéremy Tapiero, étudiant en cinéma-audiovisuel à la Sorbonne Nouvelle, il a toujours été attiré par le cinéma. Il décide de se lancer dans des études spécialisées et se lance dans différents projets parallèlement à ses études. Il enchaine les tournages en occupant différents postes, de régisseur général, assistant caméra à assistant réalisateur. Il s'essaie au jeu dans des web-séries et quelques court-métrages. Il fait de la figuration sur des films de long-métrage et des séries notamment pour Canal+ et apprend ainsi le métier de l'intérieur en observant les tournages professionnels et discutant avec des spécialistes en la matière. C'est aujourd'hui un jeune homme passionné, amoureux du cinéma et qui multiplie les expériences pour s'enrichir.

 


Le chargé de production: 
Max Mathy, 19 ans, étudiant en audiovisuel, option production. Cinéphile, il a toujours voulu travailler dans ce secteur autant sur la partie artistique que technique. La production est un bon moyen d’assister à tous ces niveaux de la réalisation d’une œuvre. Sur ce court métrage, il sert essentiellement de conseil et dans la mesure du possible, aide sur la réalisation des documents administratifs et de l'organisation budgétaire du projet.


La seconde assistante réalisatrice:
Lisa Azouz, étudiante en Cinéma à la Sorbonne Nouvelle, elle constate au fur et à mesure de sa scolarité, que c'est seulement, grâce à ce genre de projets, que son goût du métier se déclare. Rien ne la réjouit plus que de partager des expériences, tel un court-métrage, avec ses amis


Le monteur: 
Rémi Verdel, son père a toujours rêvé d'être réalisateur. Il lui transmet ce rêve depuis sa plus tendre enfance, en lui montrant les grands classiques hollywoodiens, ses coups de coeurs de la nouvelle vague, il lui transmet sa vieille caméra DV. Ce fut pour lui la découverte d'une passion. Une forme d'expression qui permette de faire rêver les gens, de les transporter ailleurs, de se remettre en question, un art regroupant tous les arts. Son souhait est de faire de cette passion un métier, une raison de se lever tous les matins, de créer. Voici un court-métrage qu'il a réalisé à l'âge de 16 ans, dans lequel il s'est investi tout entier et pour lequel il a fait un financement participatif : https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/network-short-film#/ "".


La scripte: 
Maëlle Brechoteau, plongée depuis toujours dans le monde des arts, elle est étudiante en cinéma à Paris 3. Attirée par les esthétiques travaillées et la finesse de l'écriture, elle souhaite multiplier les expériences de tournage. Elle sait se montrer déterminée dans son travail, et ce quelque soit le poste qui lui est assigné. Aussi, elle aspire à appliquer dans ses oeuvres futures, la rigueur qu'elle aime retrouver dans l'élaboration des films.


L'ingénieur son: 
Maximilien Nordlinger, en deuxième année de cinéma à la Sorbonne Nouvelle, il souhaite plus tard s'orienter vers le domaine du son et ce au cinéma ou en musique, en studio comme sur le terrain. Il réalise lui-même ses propres compositions et reprises entièrement avec des logiciels de traitement de son.

Les régisseurs: 
Amenophis Boum Make, étudiant en cinema à la Sorbonne nouvelle. Sa conception du cinéma, forgée par les nombreux films dans lesquels il s'est plongé a insufflé chez lui l'envie de créer et de mettre en forme les idées qui germent dans son esprit, et le pousse par conséquent à aspirer à devenir auteur de cinéma. Enrichit des quelques expériences qu'il a su accumuler et des créations qui s'en accompagne, il reste très intéressé par la mise en scène, s'essayant beaucoup au huis clos, et multiplie les projets qui s'offrent à lui. 



Scott Arous est un passionné de montage depuis ses 13 ans. Il commence à pratiquer ce loisir en réalisant de nombreux clips sportifs . C'est en arrivant à La Sorbonne Nouvelle en faculté de cinéma qu'il prend goût à la réalisation et à la mise en scène et se met à écrire ses propres scénarios tout en collaborant dans d'autres projets de tout genre.


La Make-up and Hair-Stylist: 
Valentine Renaud, après avoir suivi une formation spécialisée au conservatoire du maquillage à Paris, pratique aujourd'hui le métier de maquilleuse/coiffeuse en tant que professionnelle. Elle travaille sur des shooting photo mode pour des magazines,des défilés et autres événements mais également sur des court et des longs métrages. À travers ce métier qui la passionne elle aime découvrir de nouvelles expériences et chaque nouveau projet lui permet d'élargir sa palette.

One reclusive ex-soldier survives in a relatively safe, hidden location until eight survivors show up followed by a rampaging horde of lunatics. Amidst the chaos, a creeping, contagious madness slowly picks off the group one-by-one and no one knows WHO is next. Paranoia and doubt spreads. Each fears the worst. Ultimately, their gradual decline of sanity evokes an onslaught emanating from within and without their safe haven. Welcome to the Endless Whispers.

<p>
<b><u>The Nutshell</u></b>
</p>
<p>
	The Endless Whispers is a feature film with aims to shoot in 2016. Influenced by writers like HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, Robert Bloch, and Stephen King, as well as, filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski and John Carpenter, the film explores the collapse of human-nature in the face of the unknown.  
</p>
<p>
	Maximizing the impact on potential investors is essential to produce the feature film. It also provides an amazing, unique experience for the audience.
</p>
<p>
	The Endless Whispers has an amazing website, packed full of ever-expanding information. It sets the stage for the world of the story. There are 'radio' broadcasts, CB conversations, character photographs chronicling their lives, concept images (see the gallery), an in-depth timeline that reveals where the whispers began, and eight ‘featurettes’ allow the audience to meet each major character before the world ends. This collection has been dubbed The Endless Whispers Cycle.</p>

<b><u>What’s Needed</u></b><div>
<b><u><br/></u></b><p>The average low budget indie film is currently produced by either crowd-funding the film on an extremely limited budget, crowd-funding the film on a realistic budget, or raising funds through a private investor.
</p>
<p>
	For films suffering from extremely limited budgets, the quality is at such a bare minimum that it is highly unlikely to find distribution out to the world, much less turn a profit. Extremely limited budgets often require filmmakers to compromise his/her ethics with a crew and cast who work for little to no money.  The inherent risks that accompany this method of guerilla filmmaking can go so far as to result in the film never being completed.  Most of the film crowd-funds you find fall into this category.<br/>
</p>
<p>
	Attempting to crowd-fund a film for a realistic budget almost never meets its requested goal. A truly, high-quality independent film of any reasonable scope requires at least $500,000, and usually much more. Therefore, the projects either are not made, or retroactively alter themselves to accommodate what money they do raise (which always compromises the quality of the final film).
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, even if one has lucrative connections to pitch and raise funds from a private investor, it requires an expense of money for the proper materials to be created, organized, and packaged for a professional presentation.  We must be able to demonstrate, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that our project is worthy of their investment.
</p>
<p>
	Solid investors need a creatively attractive project, which includes a worthwhile script, experienced team with a cohesive vision, and a thoroughly organized production package. This includes a detailed budget accounting for all expenditures necessary to complete the film, a thorough production schedule to plan, shoot, and edit everything at maximum quality, and a solid business plan for investors to adequately comprehend the return on their investment.
</p>
<p>
	That is why outside help is desperately needed. Currently, the only hope to deliver quality films is to have a private investor. However, as stated, Endless Whispers requires the materials necessary to submit to these investors. The film needs help funding the various budgets and breakdowns. Great producing must have an accurate budget that reflects the actual costs of making the film. Therefore, the Endless Whispers team needs to afford for its amazing line producer to generate a truly accurate budget, shooting schedule, and script breakdown. Clearly, this process is essential, but not cheap. The team must scout locations, crew, and various other production costs. For Endless Whispers, the production is set overseas, in Hong Kong. Therefore, the production team needs to cover their costs for both the line producer to do their job, but also for the production team to travel to China for the scouting and development of these crucial project elements.  
</p>
<p>
	Please help Endless Whispers move forward in its production today. Dig deep and donate anything and everything you can. One can certainly throw money at another fund offering a completed film in return, but only 10%, or less, of those crowd-funded films are actually ever finished. Endless Whispers pre-production plan must reach a much smaller financial goal. This allows greater potential to deliver a far better film than other crowd funded film campaigns. 
</p>
<p>
	The Endless Whispers team crunched the numbers to get them as low as possible without metaphorically shooting this project in the proverbial foot. 
</p>
<p>
	This crucial final stage of project development needs $17,000 to pay for round trip flights to Hong Kong for the producers and director to assess locations, production resources, and other costs on Mainland China, hotel costs for the six days in Asia, fare for transportation and meals, and funds for the line producer to generate the budgets and breakdowns, as well as a few other minor tasks and expenses associated with the final development process. 
</p>
<p>
	Though the internet and telecommunications provides a minimal amount of information, the most accurate research is derived on the ground, at the actual locations, and that is what makes your donations so crucial.
</p>
<p>Please dig deep and donate. If donating is impossible, please share the campaign with friends, family, and your various social networks. Many people already believe in this film. It can be a success, but only if it is done in the right way. To rise above the quality of other low budget films, Endless Whispers needs the edge that this modest amount provides for the final stage of project development and pre-production.  Every dollar helps, but the rewards section displays some of the special incremental reward prizes offered for larger donations.</p>

</div>","An ancient, supernatural illness devastates the minds of the modern world. One reclusive ex-soldier survives in a relatively safe, hidden location until eight survivors show up followed by a rampaging horde of lunatics. Amidst the chaos, a creeping, contagious madness slowly picks off the group one-by-one and no one knows WHO is next. Paranoia and doubt spreads. Each fears the worst. Ultimately, their gradual decline of sanity evokes an onslaught emanating from within and without their safe haven. Welcome to the Endless Whispers.


The Nutshell


	The Endless Whispers is a feature film with aims to shoot in 2016. Influenced by writers like HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, Robert Bloch, and Stephen King, as well as, filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski and John Carpenter, the film explores the collapse of human-nature in the face of the unknown.  


	Maximizing the impact on potential investors is essential to produce the feature film. It also provides an amazing, unique experience for the audience.


	The Endless Whispers has an amazing website, packed full of ever-expanding information. It sets the stage for the world of the story. There are 'radio' broadcasts, CB conversations, character photographs chronicling their lives, concept images (see the gallery), an in-depth timeline that reveals where the whispers began, and eight ‘featurettes’ allow the audience to meet each major character before the world ends. This collection has been dubbed The Endless Whispers Cycle.


The CastThe journey of bringing The Endless Whispers to the screen is a long one. To that extent we have strived to bring the best production we can including the talent we choose. We think you might recognize two of our cast members. Michael Ironside (Scanners, Top Gun, Starship Troopers, Terminator: Salvation, and so many other films) and Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Pecker, American History X and many other films as well).
We are overjoyed to have brought these two on board, our producers have worked tireless to bring this about and we are very much looking forward to the performances these two major veterans of celluloid will bring to our production.

<p>I've been a writer at heart since I was very young and have always been truly amazed at the magic of film-making. Sons of Anarchy was the story that got me off my a** and it inspired me and made me excited to write again. I thought if a story like that could have that big of an impact on me, maybe a story I write can do the same for others. I love it. I'm constantly writing. Among the numerous ideas and endless thoughts was this story, written in the spirit of SOA, Reservoir Dogs and Pronto, the novel by Elmore Leonard. <br/></p>
<p>I hope audiences will take something with them when they see our film and hopefully give them a more open and heartfelt view on the world.</p>

Sons of Anarchy was the story that got me off my a** and it inspired me and made me excited to write again. I thought if a story like that could have that big of an impact on me, maybe a story I write can do the same for others. I love it. I'm constantly writing. Among the numerous ideas and endless thoughts was this story, written in the spirit of SOA, Reservoir Dogs and Pronto, the novel by Elmore Leonard. 
I hope audiences will take something with them when they see our film and hopefully give them a more open and heartfelt view on the world.

                  

    
                                                 We completed principle photography back in November 2015. Your contributions will help us get our story out to the world!
Granted, not everything always goes as planned. Sometimes there are financial emergencies that would delay the production of the perks like the DVDs and the figures, but rest assured, your donations and rewards will not be wasted.


                        
    If you know anyone who would like to help, or anyone that can help spread the word in a big way, it would certainly mean the world to all of us! You can use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word anywhere you can!
Lastly, thank you from the bottom of all of our hearts, including mine. Helping us means the world to me.

<p>It was a
Sunday morning, more than 30 years ago, when I saw on television the first episode
of the COSMOS television series by Carl Sagan.  At the beginning of this episode Sagan says a short and
simple phrase, yet unsettling: ""We are made of starstuff.""</p>
<p>So, our
bodies, our planet, the air we breathe, everything is composed of atoms that were
formed inside the stars billions of years ago.</p>
<p>Don't you feel that the he concept
behind the phrase is almost magical?. I really do. A direct relationship between us and the
rest of the Universe. We are just a part of something bigger. A part that has
become conscious and makes questions about its origins. Great.</p>
<p>But ...

Being a filmmaker has led me on a fascinating journey.  I have
travel to some of the most important scientific facilities of the world to
discover the cosmic rays and find how they can create and shape life in the
universe. Now I want to share it with you.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>My first
stop was the <b>Pierre Auger astronomical observatory</b>, in Argentina. It is the

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The next
step is in Europe. In the <b>Centre for Astrobiology</b>, a scientific research
associated to the <b>NASA Astrobiology Institute</b> we meet a scientist that shows us
how the cosmic rays can create simple molecules, even amino acids, in the
interior or dense molecular clouds. Here we find that the basic blocks for life
can be created anywhere in the Universe thanks to the action of cosmic rays.</span></p>

<h3>What we need</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>We believe in the direct relationship between authors and audience, so sharing the creation of this documentary with you is our first step. We want to build a community interested in high quality and high scientific content documentaries. But we also want to share this content so please talk to your colleagues, arrange a screening in an education center or institution and be active in the film network. </p><p>You have the ""BE A SUN"" perk specially designed for the screenings.</p>
<p>The basic 5.000 $ goal will really help us to move on the production. There is no upper limit, so the more people want to be involved in the project the better creative options we will have to complete it, and we will feel more confident to continue with the next projects also about the non-thermal Universe. </p>
<p>As the author of the film I still want to include two additional parts. In one of them we will discover why lighting is really important in primitive planets atmospheres to create life. We plan to do it with modern experiments that simulate those performed by Miller and Urey in the 50´s. I will try to do it in a desert landscape... at night.</p>
<p>In the second additional part we will find out how cosmic rays can be responsible of DNA mutations in already formed life. Scientist from the Blue Marble Space Institute in the USA will help us so we need to rent some equipment there and pay for the flights.  If we don´t get the money we would probably change this location. </p>
<p>So the money supporting this project will go to:</p><p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pay the scientists </span>accommodation during the days of shooting.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Rent some lights and a power generator for the desert part.  </span></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Clean the sound and add some sound effects.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Color correction in some parts of the film.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Pay for the flights and car rental.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Pay for camera operator and sound man in the shooting.</span></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><h3>The impact<span style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span>
</h3><p></p><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Once we finish the film it will be distributed internationally for TV broadcasting. The contract for this is already signed so it is pretty sure to have several millions of viewers. Additionally we always enter in the science films festivals circuit around the world screening in theaters and having talks with the people.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">But we do feel that these scientific contents must be in the schools so we do normally screenings at </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">high schools to share the knowledge and as part of our social program. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For this movie you can get the BE THE SUN perk which includes a licence for screening in your education institution. You have now the unique opportunity to screen high quality science documentaries in your center for a really small perk. We can even skype when you run the session with your students.</span></p>
</div> <h3>Do you dare to complete the sentence...?</h3><h3></h3><p>""We are made of starstuff"" may not be complete. After you see the whole film you will understand that stars are still taking care of us. It is not only that they made our atoms, they also take part in the process of creating life. How could we include this in a new sentence? </p><p>All backer above 25$ have to opportunity to share their ideas and vote for the better ones.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><br/></p><div>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<b></b><p>A big part of the film is already done. We have a contract for international distribution with an UK company and several broadcasters have confirmed the acquisition. But first we need to finish the film and you can be a part of it.</p>
<p>Risks are really small. They were big in the beginning, a few months ago, but know we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. If we don´t get the goal we will keep working to finish the film, but with the money we can really speed up and take some effects and post-production to the next level. </p> </div><div>

You can now be part of this documentary. Enjoy and support the direct relationship between author and audience in a new and fascinating science film (and get your rewards...)

It was a
Sunday morning, more than 30 years ago, when I saw on television the first episode
of the COSMOS television series by Carl Sagan.  At the beginning of this episode Sagan says a short and
simple phrase, yet unsettling: ""We are made of starstuff.""
So, our
bodies, our planet, the air we breathe, everything is composed of atoms that were
formed inside the stars billions of years ago.
Don't you feel that the he concept
behind the phrase is almost magical?. I really do. A direct relationship between us and the
rest of the Universe. We are just a part of something bigger. A part that has
become conscious and makes questions about its origins. Great.
But ...
what if the sentence is incomplete?
During my PhD studies
in the late 90´s I was focused on small subatomic particles moving almost at the
speed of light through space, the cosmic radiation. Cosmic rays are caused
largely by the stars, especially at the end of their life when they become
supernovae, pulsars or black holes.
We know that we
are made of star stuff, but what if the role of the stars does not stop there?
Could these supernovas and black holes somehow affect life on planets? Could
cosmic rays be somehow a link between distant stars and us?
Romantic
idea, almost mystical. We are not only formed by matter that was forged inside
the stars, those stars also may be responsible for creating the spark of life
and even making it evolve.



In this
documentary I want to show you that this is not only a mystical idea. The latest scientific discoveries point in this direction.  If this is so, then we need to complete the phrase ""We are made
of star stuff"", but we need your help. You can let us know your
suggestions, share with the community and find the improved version of the
sentence all together. Backers over 25$ will have this opportunity.

Being a filmmaker has led me on a fascinating journey.  I have
travel to some of the most important scientific facilities of the world to
discover the cosmic rays and find how they can create and shape life in the
universe. Now I want to share it with you.
My first
stop was the Pierre Auger astronomical observatory, in Argentina. It is the

The basic 5.000 $ goal will really help us to move on the production. There is no upper limit, so the more people want to be involved in the project the better creative options we will have to complete it, and we will feel more confident to continue with the next projects also about the non-thermal Universe. 
As the author of the film I still want to include two additional parts. In one of them we will discover why lighting is really important in primitive planets atmospheres to create life. We plan to do it with modern experiments that simulate those performed by Miller and Urey in the 50´s. I will try to do it in a desert landscape... at night.
In the second additional part we will find out how cosmic rays can be responsible of DNA mutations in already formed life. Scientist from the Blue Marble Space Institute in the USA will help us so we need to rent some equipment there and pay for the flights.  If we don´t get the money we would probably change this location. 
So the money supporting this project will go to:
Pay the scientists accommodation during the days of shooting.
Rent some lights and a power generator for the desert part.  
Clean the sound and add some sound effects.
Color correction in some parts of the film.
Pay for the flights and car rental.
Pay for camera operator and sound man in the shooting.


The impact 

Once we finish the film it will be distributed internationally for TV broadcasting. The contract for this is already signed so it is pretty sure to have several millions of viewers. Additionally we always enter in the science films festivals circuit around the world screening in theaters and having talks with the people.
But we do feel that these scientific contents must be in the schools so we do normally screenings at high schools to share the knowledge and as part of our social program. 
For this movie you can get the BE THE SUN perk which includes a licence for screening in your education institution. You have now the unique opportunity to screen high quality science documentaries in your center for a really small perk. We can even skype when you run the session with your students.
 Do you dare to complete the sentence...?""We are made of starstuff"" may not be complete. After you see the whole film you will understand that stars are still taking care of us. It is not only that they made our atoms, they also take part in the process of creating life. How could we include this in a new sentence? All backer above 25$ have to opportunity to share their ideas and vote for the better ones. 
Risks
A big part of the film is already done. We have a contract for international distribution with an UK company and several broadcasters have confirmed the acquisition. But first we need to finish the film and you can be a part of it.
Risks are really small. They were big in the beginning, a few months ago, but know we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. If we don´t get the goal we will keep working to finish the film, but with the money we can really speed up and take some effects and post-production to the next level.  
Who is behind the film


Daniel Vega
is the director and writer of this story. He is a physicist and has a background
in astrophysics and biology. He has written previously four
science&nature films shown by National Geographic, Discovery, France 5,
Animal Planet, Odisea, RAI, TVE, TVP and other major broadcasters.
The films he has directed or written has been awarded or become finalist in different film festivals around the world: Vaasa International Nature Film Festival, Ronda Nature and Science Film Festival, Science House in La Coruña, International Science Film Festival in Athens, World Of Knowledge Science Film Festival of Russia, Vedere la Scienza in Italy, European Science TV and New Media Festival or the Japan Wildlife Film Festival.





Personal
note from the director:  Thank you
for being part of this project. I do believe that TV documentaries are really a very cool
and effective tool for science communication. My works will never treat you as
a passive subject, I understand that you are an intelligent being and feel curiosity and passion about knowing the world we live in. This is your chance
to be part of an smart and well constructed story about the deeply unknown cosmic radiation
and life presence in the Universe. The topic is really new for television and I would love this work to be the first one
of a 3 chapters series. The so called non-thermal universe hides secrets that I
do consider the modern cosmic frontier.Internet has become the perfect link between the creative people and their followers. I am pretty sure that the future will be like this and authors will be able to find the way to be free and create beautiful stories for the people.
 Some short rough cuts from the filmIn this cut, Jasper Kirkby a scientist from CERN tell us how distant stars ""the cousins of our Sun"" can be responsible for changes in our atmosphere. The filming was done very close to Geneva.

In this cut we have a fast look to the flourescence buildings that are part of the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. Flourescence light happens in the atmosphere because of high energy cosmic rays passing through it. In the first seconds you can find Ron Shellard, a scientist working in the observatory.


The interstellar medium if full with complex molecules that can reach newly formed planets. This is part of the shooting was done in the Center of Astrobiology in Madrid. This is a facility associated to the Nasa Astrobiology Institute.

Pavel Motloch is one of the scientist working in the Pierre Auger Observatory. In this part he tell us how we can classify cosmic rays depending on their energy. We shot this part in the car, while driving west to the Andes Range.

Aurora Borealis, or northern lights, are also caused by cosmic rays. But they are low energy particles coming from the sun. High energy particles coming from outside our solar system produce another phenomenon, also amazing, but invisible to our eyes.

In this last cut Jasper Kirkby makes an important and precise resume of the story behind this film. You need to see this.


Other ways you can help Please, share in your networks. It is important to reach as more people as possible so at the end we can screen the film in more places.",7.0,6,"1 Campaign

Stop Dreaming and Start Achieving Your Goals
You have big dreams and want to
 achieve all, if not as many as your life goals. But the thoughts of 
reaching those goals seem to be overwhelming. No longer you need to 
wonder how you can make them happen. With this platform, you can create 
your dreams, goals and bucket lists, and be able to plan out what need 
to be done and who can help you going there. 

What goals do YOU want to achieve in your lifetime?  Make a list of 100 goals you’d like to achieve in your life time. Include things like when they will happen, where they will happen, how much you need, who you want to get help or involve, how it can happen and so on. Check off those life goals whether they are personal, experience, financial, fun, travel, physical, spiritual, skill-set, or business goals.  Invite friends and mentors to be your accompanies. Continue to check off and add new goals to the list. Accomplish everything you want, track it and share it if you like to empower others.


The platform helps people to organize, focus, clarify and networking to build the social relationship capital; BRINGING the key factors into one place in order to accomplish one’s life goals, dreams and give people sense of accomplishment, contribution and belonging and more.

The company’s vision is to bring forward passion, real life experience, expertise, knowledge, and mentor-ship into one place.

· Create your profile, group or project. #goals, #dreams, #milestones. Dream BIG and keep the end goals in mind. Plan and budget from your ideas, concepts to completion of the project.

No more
questionable work ethics.  With this
platform, you can see how people actually walk the talk. Keep each other
accountable as you help others to achieve their dreams and goals, others will
also help you. 
The journey
to ‪success doesn't have to be ‪‎lonely. We are all here to ‎empower and ‎connect with one another. The
ultimate ‎goal of ‎life is to love and ‎help each other so that we all can
reach our highest ‎potentials.  ‎


Fulfillment and ‎happiness come from ‎Contributions, ‎Belongings and ‎Meanings. Success without fulfillment is a failure.  True success is from sharing and bringing your mission and vision to reality by working with others.
We believe that everyone has the potential to do greater things. Everyone was created for a purpose. But people can't be successful working alone. ​That's why we created New Rich World. 
NewRichWorld is a tool to build a supportive and transparent world where access to expertise is no longer a bottleneck. To help people identify who they really are, working on achieving their most important life goals and share their missions, visions and goals in life. To connect the seekers of knowledge and expertise with those who have both in spades. 

We want all of our users to live a rich life and connect with others who want to live a rich life.  But a rich life doesn’t always refer to wealth.  I rich life means you accomplish everything you want.  And you never fall short of your full potential. Fulfillment is when we live more for ourselves and to take care of others. 
We are a
social enterprise that believes in life work integration.Today we finally have our teams 
ready to bring this platform together. We just need one more thing.

<p><b>About the film:</b></p>
<p><i>Who I Am</i> is a drama short film <b>based on true events, with an original
script written by Monika Wilczynska. </b>It is a coming of
age tale about Elijah, a young transgender teenager from a very religious
background, who has to try to reconcile their identity with their faith and their
family’s expectations of them. With the help of anti-conformist Lisbeth and
their friends, Elijah learns not to compromise their own integrity in face of prejudice
and adversity. The film inquires: can an LGBTQ-identifying person benefit from
religion whilst staying true to who they are? Why is it important to tackle
identity in regards to religion? How restrictive is our perception of
spirituality and divinity? <i>Who I Am </i>does
not attempt to answer these questions, but it aspires to open the dialogue to
the public on subjects that have been under-represented or taboo for far too
long.</p>
<p><b>Why
is it important to make it? </b></p>
<p><i>Who I Am</i> aims to raise awareness of the struggles
which are encountered not only by members of the Transgender Community, but by
anyone who feels that they do not fit ‘the norms’ established by our society. Thanks
to united but socially, ethnically and religiously diverse cast and crew, this
project encourages love, tolerance and acceptance of every human being,
regardless of their differences. </p>

<p>Five years ago,  I was given a beautiful custom made corset, that I lovingly..and obsessively..embellished with over 4000 rhinestones.</p>
<p>Little did I know that this item would send me down a crazy rabbit hole of creation that would eventually lead me to making a circus art film called Fugue. </p>
<p>Fugue began as a solo act, but as the act got more and more elaborate, I realized that it would be too weird for the corporate shows with high enough production values, and too big to fit into a show that might give me the artistic license to do it.</p>
<p>I've been working, piece by piece, on this project for over five years, creating costumes, original music, original apparatuses, set and animation design and choreography. And I've gotten to the point where I can no longer finish it with my funding alone.</p>
<p>I've assembled a diverse cast and crew and we are ready to bring forth the magic! We just need your help to raise an additional $25,000 in order to make the film!</p>

A few years later she went to circus ""grad school"" at San Francisco's Circus Center, where she studied aerial with Helene Turcotte and Elena Panova and Mongolian contortion with Serchmaa Byamba. <br/><br/>She has been across the country and back, as an aerialist in Circus Flora and the Zoppe Family Circus, featured in a Superbowl commercial with the cast of Glee, opening act for Willie Nelson, and performing in Teatro Zinzanni.

</div></div>","The Story
  ""Fugue"" is a circus art film that is loosely framed on the Cinderella archetype. Our version of this story is about a would-be princess who explores themes of self-doubt, loss, and escapism through movement, music, animation and vivid costuming. 



The Details



Five years ago,  I was given a beautiful custom made corset, that I lovingly..and obsessively..embellished with over 4000 rhinestones.
Little did I know that this item would send me down a crazy rabbit hole of creation that would eventually lead me to making a circus art film called Fugue. 
Fugue began as a solo act, but as the act got more and more elaborate, I realized that it would be too weird for the corporate shows with high enough production values, and too big to fit into a show that might give me the artistic license to do it.
I've been working, piece by piece, on this project for over five years, creating costumes, original music, original apparatuses, set and animation design and choreography. And I've gotten to the point where I can no longer finish it with my funding alone.
I've assembled a diverse cast and crew and we are ready to bring forth the magic! We just need your help to raise an additional $25,000 in order to make the film!
The Team





As a child,  Mariel grew up in the circus. She began her aerial career at age seven in her family's show, The Reynolds Family Circus, and trained classically as a musician on three different instruments by the time she was nine. Her formative college years were spent alternately as a theatre student at St. Louis University and as an expat singing in jazz clubs and studying at Ecole du Cirque Menival in Lyon, France. A few years later she went to circus ""grad school"" at San Francisco's Circus Center, where she studied aerial with Helene Turcotte and Elena Panova and Mongolian contortion with Serchmaa Byamba. She has been across the country and back, as an aerialist in Circus Flora and the Zoppe Family Circus, featured in a Superbowl commercial with the cast of Glee, opening act for Willie Nelson, and performing in Teatro Zinzanni. She currently resides in Kansas City with her family and is on staff Lucia Aerial Arts.






Claude Cardenas hails from the Bay Area and Central Valley of California. Having studied studied film and television at San Joaquin Delta College, he quickly moved on to acquire real world experience with Hot House Entertainment and Falcon Studios.


Claude has had videos premiere on Vice, Bust, and Nylon.  His film ""b"" was screened in San Francisco and Modesto, California and the original short film version of ""Fugue"" with Mariel a  la Mode premiered in the Free State Film Festival in Lawrence, KS 2015.


John joined KCAI in 2010 and teaches interactive arts and animation. Previously, he was an animator with MK12, a Kansas City-based motion graphics firm, where he was responsible for generating concepts for clients from storyboards to final animation. He also worked as editor and data manager on national and international film and video productions. John was responsible for shooting footage, including short films, and he handled filming and processing green-screen footage, rotoscope work and various visual effects. Before that he was an animator with Video Post Productions in Kansas City, where he worked in 2-D and 3-D animation for national and international clients. 


Brent began his career as a photojournalist, then began a journey into circus arts at the City Museum in St. Louis. There he studied juggling, aerial, contortion and hand balancing with renowned Mongolian contortion teacher Rosa Yagaantseteg.  A quick learner, he became proficient at aerial Silks, Trapeze, Rope, and Straps. Since then, he has performed in such shows and venues as The Beggar's Carnival, Circus Kaput, The House of Blues in New Orleans, The Lakewood Theater in Dallas, and The Bacchus Ball in Kansas City. Brent holds a photography degree from Webster University and continues to work as a freelance photographer in addition to circus feats.
Maxi Glamour might be the most peculiar creature ever to surface in the drag scene of St. Louis.  With a rambunctious performance style and wildly colorful makeup this performer is a breed of their own.  Known as the Demon Queen of Polka and Baklava, Maxi is a wild ball of energy that always delivers a raw performance filled with excitement and acrobatics.  Founder of Qu'art, a local organization who's mission statement is to provide visibility of the wide diversity of queer artists.  No one's ever sure what this demon will do next, but you're sure to be on the edge of your seat.

</div><p>Aborted Traffick Feature film is about human trafficking in several forms and the impact it has on several lives due to the decisions they make. From the city to rolling plains in small towns, the traffick detours for fear of being aborted. There's always a dark side of the road. The film does not contain nudity. </p><div>
</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Are We</h3><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p></p>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.beawbliss.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bea W. Bliss</a>, actress, producer, and artist. Also the writer, director and producer of Aborted Traffick Feature film. I've produced several projects, this will be my 2nd ""directed"" film as the short was my first. I love to create, I created my own production company, BWBliss Entertainment, to be able to produce and create meaningful, inspiring, challenging, and unique content. While I don't have millions or even several hundred thousands of dollars. I do have a vision and tons of slates.</p>
<p>I firmly believe your vision should never be denied due to lack of funds. Crowdfunding for independent filmmaking is necessary in some cases. It allows a vision to move forward which can lead to the work and talent being seen by different audiences. Some of the best creative work I've seen have come from independent filmmakers. With the help of contributors as you, ""Aborted Traffick: The Countdown"" will be one of those films.</p>
</div><div>
</div><p><a href=""http://www.briandmoody.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brian D. Moody</a>, Creative Director of Studio A3E, is a multimedia artist and leads the project as Director of Photography, and Producing Partner. Brian and I have produced several projects together over the years. He is a very talented, unique filmmaker and electronic musician with extensive knowledge and skill in cinema. He is a cinegenious, my word for a genius behind the lens and creative content.</p><div>
</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why a Film about Human Trafficking?</h3><div>
</div><p>Because it's real, it exists, and it's necessary to shed light on the growing issue that not only happens in large cities, but also in small towns, and our own communities. The film is unique because it deals with several forms of human trafficking that are rarely mentioned in the media or told by other films. It is important that education of the issue is told in a true form without holding back the reality of what really happens.  I also have a personal story of an incident I witnessed as a child. Sometimes the truth or what you may feel be, comes out years later. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459097006/htphl2k7di1a8gokabr1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div>
</div><p>Seeing is believing. Filming the short of Aborted Traffick I ran into many obstacles, even though it was filmed in the town I grew up in. It was the first film production ever to be done there and resources are very low and not familiar to most, the film had mainly local aspiring talent and  not to mention I was a first time ""director"". Many doubted the film's start and completion. With a talented crew, aspiring cast, and a few supporters and believers, we came away with a great quality film that went into the town's history books. The private screening was well received and deemed very educational. The film was also offered to air on Comcast Cable network after completion.  Proof of Concept: Teaser trailer below:</p><div>

</div><h3>Fundraising</h3><div>
</div><div>The short film was completed on a modest budget of $15,000. For the feature film there is a need for a minimum of $45,000, but with more the vision can be expanded.  Here's why:</div><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul>
<li>All aspects of Pre-Production, Production, and Post Production, have to be covered. That includes anywhere from insurance, staff, crew, equipment, food, locations, editing, sound design, travel, marketing, and much more. </li>
<li>The short film sparked interest in some great talent who expressed interest in the feature. Because they are ""working actors"" we want to ""due"" right to them. </li>
<li>We plan to seek for national distribution with networks/studios and partner with an VOD aggregator where the film will be available on Amazon and other digital distribution outlets such as Hulu and Netflix after national festival runs.</li>
<li>The short was filmed exclusively in Alabama. We will be crossing state lines.</li>

</div>","Aborted Traffick Feature film is about human trafficking in several forms and the impact it has on several lives due to the decisions they make. From the city to rolling plains in small towns, the traffick detours for fear of being aborted. There's always a dark side of the road. The film does not contain nudity. 
Who Are We

My name is Bea W. Bliss, actress, producer, and artist. Also the writer, director and producer of Aborted Traffick Feature film. I've produced several projects, this will be my 2nd ""directed"" film as the short was my first. I love to create, I created my own production company, BWBliss Entertainment, to be able to produce and create meaningful, inspiring, challenging, and unique content. While I don't have millions or even several hundred thousands of dollars. I do have a vision and tons of slates.
I firmly believe your vision should never be denied due to lack of funds. Crowdfunding for independent filmmaking is necessary in some cases. It allows a vision to move forward which can lead to the work and talent being seen by different audiences. Some of the best creative work I've seen have come from independent filmmakers. With the help of contributors as you, ""Aborted Traffick: The Countdown"" will be one of those films.

Brian D. Moody, Creative Director of Studio A3E, is a multimedia artist and leads the project as Director of Photography, and Producing Partner. Brian and I have produced several projects together over the years. He is a very talented, unique filmmaker and electronic musician with extensive knowledge and skill in cinema. He is a cinegenious, my word for a genius behind the lens and creative content.
Why a Film about Human Trafficking?
Because it's real, it exists, and it's necessary to shed light on the growing issue that not only happens in large cities, but also in small towns, and our own communities. The film is unique because it deals with several forms of human trafficking that are rarely mentioned in the media or told by other films. It is important that education of the issue is told in a true form without holding back the reality of what really happens.  I also have a personal story of an incident I witnessed as a child. Sometimes the truth or what you may feel be, comes out years later. Risks & Challenges
Seeing is believing. Filming the short of Aborted Traffick I ran into many obstacles, even though it was filmed in the town I grew up in. It was the first film production ever to be done there and resources are very low and not familiar to most, the film had mainly local aspiring talent and  not to mention I was a first time ""director"". Many doubted the film's start and completion. With a talented crew, aspiring cast, and a few supporters and believers, we came away with a great quality film that went into the town's history books. The private screening was well received and deemed very educational. The film was also offered to air on Comcast Cable network after completion.  Proof of Concept: Teaser trailer below:
Aborted Traffick Feature Film Approved For Fiscal Sponsorship
“Aborted Traffick:The Countdown Feature Film” is honored to be fiscally sponsored by From the Heart Productions Inc, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that supports unique films that make a contribution to society. The sponsorship says a lot about the film, the message, and others belief in it. By contributing to this film, you're not only helping other socially conscious films get made, but your donation of any amount is also 100% tax-deductible and will go directly to completing the film, with From the Heart Productions monitoring the progress, rest assured.""From the Heart Productions is proud to sponsor BWBliss Entertainment and their brilliant feature film Aborted Traffick:The Countdown. Bea W. Bliss has taken an important social issue and wrapped it in a compelling feature film. We encourage you to support her.""Carole Lee DeanPresidentFrom the Heart Productions, Inc



Fundraising
The short film was completed on a modest budget of $15,000. For the feature film there is a need for a minimum of $45,000, but with more the vision can be expanded.  Here's why:


All aspects of Pre-Production, Production, and Post Production, have to be covered. That includes anywhere from insurance, staff, crew, equipment, food, locations, editing, sound design, travel, marketing, and much more. 
The short film sparked interest in some great talent who expressed interest in the feature. Because they are ""working actors"" we want to ""due"" right to them. 
We plan to seek for national distribution with networks/studios and partner with an VOD aggregator where the film will be available on Amazon and other digital distribution outlets such as Hulu and Netflix after national festival runs.
The short was filmed exclusively in Alabama. We will be crossing state lines.



The Impact
 After Aborted Traffick short was announced to film, a human trafficking survivor contacted me to share her story of being a victim. She will share her story in a special interview. I feel that the feature will have even more of an impact on those who have survived it and can be detoured from it. There are lives to be saved that want to be saved. Sponsorships Your brand or company can be an corporate sponsor with full publicity related to the film. That includes print, media, events, screening, and premiere. Sponsorship packages are available. Bronze, Silver, Gold & Platinum. Email for more information and to request sponsorship package.

</p><p><b>THERE IS A BELIEF</b>
that runs deep in American society that caring for one's child is not
economically relevant, and therefore childcare is worthless.</p>
<p>This theme runs through our media, work culture, and public
policy (or lack thereof). As such, families with children don't have the
cultural and economic support to thrive in the workplace nor the support from
public policy legislation that ALL OTHER democratic nations enjoy. </p>
<p><b>WE BELIEVE</b> that
Americans' TRUE VALUES concerning moms, dads, caregivers, and families aren't
reflected in today's (<i>un</i>)pop-culture
and public policy.</p>
<p>If you share our belief, JOIN US.</p>
<p><b>""MOM IS A DIRTY
WORD""</b> is a feature documentary that explores how stereotyped gender
roles and the anti-family sentiment that pervades the media and public policy
has sabotaged caregivers. We've captured over 50% of the footage we need to
reach the film’s completion. During production thus far, our cameras have
introduced us to many inspiring figures, from leading experts and best-selling
authors, including: Ann Crittenden, Heather Boushey, Susan Douglas, and Arlie
Russell Hochschild. </p>
<p><b>NOT JUST A “WOMAN’S
ISSUE”</b></p>
<p>Paid family leave is fast becoming a hot issue and many
prominent male figures have taken up the battlecry alongside women. Barack
Obama, Joe Biden, and even CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg have put their muscle
into the cause that until now has unfortunately been seen as a “woman’s issue.”
Of course, paid family leave impacts the entire family, including fathers and
caregivers of ill or aging parents. If we overcome our differences and work
together, remembering this main message: the health of our children and welfare
of our family is worth it - then through a shift in thinking and public policy
changes, we will improve the lives of our children and the Moms and Dads of
tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>WHILE THERE HAS BEEN
PROGRESS… </b>In 2016, New York has joined three other states in enacting paid
family leave (California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island). NY’s law will go into
effect in January 2018, guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid leave. This will help
many employed New York State workers to care for a new birth child, adopted
child, or an ill family member. In addition, workers will be protected from
being fired during paid leave (California on the other hand, has no such
protection). While these steps are certainly a way forward, MUCH MORE is
needed.</p>
<p><b>NOW MORE THAN EVER! </b>Wages
are stagnant, savings are at an ALL TIME LOW. Although 13% of American workers
have access to paid family leave, MANY CHOOSE NOT to take up the offer. WHY?
Because the paid leave that does exist does not cover the full salary (often
only 60%), and workers simply cannot afford to take it. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Why do we force Moms and Dads to choose between
economic stability vs. caring for their newborns?</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Why do we compel hard-workers to make a choice between
caring for a family member with a serious illness vs. a paycheck? </p>
<p>The answer is simple. The United States talks BIG TALK about
pro-Motherhood, especially around this time of the year. But this period
between Mother’s Day and Father’s Day should be a time of reflection and
hopefully, realization. That AMERICA holds a long-standing stigma against Moms
and caregiving; AMERICA is ANTI-FAMILY.</p>
<p>TOGETHER, we can MAKE A CHANGE.</p>
<p><b>OUR GOAL</b> for this
film is to raise awareness and encourage our AUDIENCE to become PARTICIPANTS.
We need to create real momentum. It's time for parents to unite and contact
policymakers to enact legislation so that all caregivers - men and women - have
the means to provide and support their children, raising healthy, well-adjusted
adults. America's future depends on it.</p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE DIRECTOR,
SAMANTHA RIFE</b>: ""MOM IS A DIRTY WORD"" is my dream project. As a
Mother of two, I've noticed a gap between the high-quality care and attention
moms and dads want to provide their children, and the reality. You don't have
to look further than your white picket fence to see that America becomes more
anti-family each year. From child-free businesses to the lack of support of
Mothers breastfeeding in public, moms and dads struggle uphill as they try to
stay competitive in the workforce, earning a living to support their family,
and provide the time and attention required to raise healthy children. </p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432777421/ksxkqosjp9mjdz3cuknk.png"" src="""" style=""""/><i>Director, Samantha Rife</i><br/><span></span><p><br/><span><b></b>
</span></p><p><b>THIS IS YEAR THREE</b>
of filming ""MOM IS A DIRTY WORD"". My team has shot over 50% of the
footage and we hope to rally our forces for the FINAL STRETCH HOME.</p>
<p><b>WHAT HAVE I LEARNED
SO FAR? </b>Through my public policy research and many discussions with parents
and experts, it's clear that America is the only developed nation with
downright disregard for parents and caregivers. It's time family-positive
public policy is enacted, and for that we need YOUR SUPPORT.</p>
<p><b>YOUR INDIEGOGO
CONTRIBUTIONS</b> give us the final financial and emotional push we need to
wrap up the film production phase for Summer 2016 and edit the film in Fall
2016.</p>
<p><b>WHY do we need your
SUPPORT?</b></p>
<p>Actually, you need this support too!</p>
<p><b>1. LACK OF
FAMILY-FRIENDLY PUBLIC POLICY</b></p>
<p>- Because you have a mom or love a mom.</p>
<p>- Because at one point in your life, whether you have
children or not - you (yes, YOU) are either going to be a caregiver (for a
child or aging parent), or a care receiver. <br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FF5I_AVOSKoc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF5I_AVOSKoc%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FF5I_AVOSKoc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>You will want a job to return to if a loved one is ill or
you need to take time off to help an aging parent. Until we change public
policy to protect citizens who will be caregivers at one point in their lives,
we are all simply crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.</p>
<p><b>WHILE CERTAIN
COMPANIES OFFER PAID FAMILY LEAVE, A STIGMA PERSISTS…</b></p>
<p>Dozens of companies are extending paid family leave to many
of their employees (caveat - often with the exception of their call service
employees). Just some of these companies include: Facebook, Netflix, Amazon,
Hasbro, Twitter, Wells Fargo, and Yahoo. HOWEVER, although CEO Marissa Mayer
increased the company’s maternity leave from eight to 16 weeks, she only took <i>two weeks</i> paid leave after the birth of
her baby. What kind of message does that send to female Yahoo employees? Let’s
look at the numbers…</p>
<p>While 16 weeks of paid leave was offered, a mere 75% of
Yahoo female employees who had babies took the full 16-week leave. </p>
<p><b>FIRST MONTHS ARE
CRITICAL - for the MOM and the NEWBORN</b></p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>Paid leave encourages breastfeeding and newborn
bonding.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>Paid family leave positively impacts infant outcomes
like birth weight and infant mortality.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>Plus… paid family leave increases the likelihood that
mothers will return to work and careers.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>As an example: California’s paid family leave has
actually INCREASED weekly hours and pay of mothers with 1- to 3-year-old
children by nearly 10%.</p>
<p><b>2. CULTURAL BIAS AT
THE WORKPLACE</b></p>
<p>Mothers are at a disadvantage in the workplace, facing
discrimination from hiring practices to starting salaries. Below are just some
of the ways mothers are treated unjustly in the workplace.</p>
<p><b>HIRING PRACTICES</b></p>
<p>MOTHERS ARE 79% LESS LIKELY TO BE HIRED THAN NON-MOTHERS OF
COMPARABLE QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE <i>*Corell
and Bernard Cornell Study</i></p>
<p><i>“SHHHHHhhh, I’m a
Mother…”</i></p>
<p>When 192 study participants were asked to evaluate resumes
of equivalent experience and performance, there was no preference of one resume
over another. However, when a memo mentioning the applicant was a Mother of two
was added to some of the job applicant resumes, the study participants stated
they would hire 84% of the applicants without children, compared with only 47%
of the applicants that were Mothers.</p>

<p><b>STARTING SALARIES</b></p>
<p>When participants designated starting salaries to the
applicants in the Corell and Bernard study, participants proposed applicants
without children $11,000 more, on average than Mothers.</p>
<p><b>FEWER CALL-BACKS</b></p>
<p>Prospective employers are less likely to call back Mothers
for interviews when compared to applicants without children. <br/></p>

<p><b>3. OTHER TOPICS OF
DISCUSSION IN ""MOM IS A DIRTY WORD""</b></p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The idea that as soon as women deliver, they're
encouraged to “shed the pregnancy weight,"" removing the scars a.k.a
""badges"" of Motherhood.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The notion that women must ""do it all"" and
never complain, because that's unbecoming of a Mom<b> and they must TAKE IT LIKE A WOMAN. </b>Of course, this creates guilt
and a ""bad-Mommy"" complex.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The discrimination against Mothers breastfeeding in
public.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The controversial trend of ""child-free""
businesses and the increasing momentum of the ‘Ban the Brat’ and ‘No-Kid
Allowed’ movements.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The rise in the popularity of ‘egg freezing’ among
women and employers.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The increasing number of women opting out of having
children entirely and why.</p>
<p>?<span> 
</span>The sparsity of relatable Mothers in TV and film. Media
representations of mothers still reinforce the same stock characterizations
that existed in the 1950s – bad mothers vs. good mothers and that maternal
problems are not public but personal issues.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our team includes professional, working filmmakers who have produced 
feature-length, award-winning films. We are aware of the unexpected 
challenges that can come up in movie-making and are taking every 
precaution to minimize potential roadblocks. </p>
<p>Like all filmmakers, our ultimate goal is for the documentary to gain
 an audience, and for that one depends on finding a distribution 
partner. While our team has secured DVD and VOD distribution for other 
feature films, there is never any guarantee we will earn distribution 
for MDW. However, our passion for MDW is contagious. The stories of our 
Moms and Dads featured in MDW are inspiring, and we believe this project
 will attract a fabulous distribution partner. </p>
<p>If after making the rounds on the festival circuit we do not find a 
distribution partner, we will self-distribute. Throughout the duration 
of this project, we will always maintain our true mission: to improve 
the lives of Mothers in the United States. We will never compromise our 
mission and always choose to collaborate with people and organizations 
that are as passionate about Moms as we are.</p>

</div></span><br/><p></p></div>","THERE IS A BELIEF
that runs deep in American society that caring for one's child is not
economically relevant, and therefore childcare is worthless.
This theme runs through our media, work culture, and public
policy (or lack thereof). As such, families with children don't have the
cultural and economic support to thrive in the workplace nor the support from
public policy legislation that ALL OTHER democratic nations enjoy. 
WE BELIEVE that
Americans' TRUE VALUES concerning moms, dads, caregivers, and families aren't
reflected in today's (un)pop-culture
and public policy.
If you share our belief, JOIN US.
""MOM IS A DIRTY
WORD"" is a feature documentary that explores how stereotyped gender
roles and the anti-family sentiment that pervades the media and public policy
has sabotaged caregivers. We've captured over 50% of the footage we need to
reach the film’s completion. During production thus far, our cameras have
introduced us to many inspiring figures, from leading experts and best-selling
authors, including: Ann Crittenden, Heather Boushey, Susan Douglas, and Arlie
Russell Hochschild. 
NOT JUST A “WOMAN’S
ISSUE”
Paid family leave is fast becoming a hot issue and many
prominent male figures have taken up the battlecry alongside women. Barack
Obama, Joe Biden, and even CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg have put their muscle
into the cause that until now has unfortunately been seen as a “woman’s issue.”
Of course, paid family leave impacts the entire family, including fathers and
caregivers of ill or aging parents. If we overcome our differences and work
together, remembering this main message: the health of our children and welfare
of our family is worth it - then through a shift in thinking and public policy
changes, we will improve the lives of our children and the Moms and Dads of
tomorrow.
WHILE THERE HAS BEEN
PROGRESS… In 2016, New York has joined three other states in enacting paid
family leave (California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island). NY’s law will go into
effect in January 2018, guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid leave. This will help
many employed New York State workers to care for a new birth child, adopted
child, or an ill family member. In addition, workers will be protected from
being fired during paid leave (California on the other hand, has no such
protection). While these steps are certainly a way forward, MUCH MORE is
needed.
NOW MORE THAN EVER! Wages
are stagnant, savings are at an ALL TIME LOW. Although 13% of American workers
have access to paid family leave, MANY CHOOSE NOT to take up the offer. WHY?
Because the paid leave that does exist does not cover the full salary (often
only 60%), and workers simply cannot afford to take it. 
- 
Why do we force Moms and Dads to choose between
economic stability vs. caring for their newborns?
- 
Why do we compel hard-workers to make a choice between
caring for a family member with a serious illness vs. a paycheck? 
The answer is simple. The United States talks BIG TALK about
pro-Motherhood, especially around this time of the year. But this period
between Mother’s Day and Father’s Day should be a time of reflection and
hopefully, realization. That AMERICA holds a long-standing stigma against Moms
and caregiving; AMERICA is ANTI-FAMILY.
TOGETHER, we can MAKE A CHANGE.
OUR GOAL for this
film is to raise awareness and encourage our AUDIENCE to become PARTICIPANTS.
We need to create real momentum. It's time for parents to unite and contact
policymakers to enact legislation so that all caregivers - men and women - have
the means to provide and support their children, raising healthy, well-adjusted
adults. America's future depends on it.
ABOUT THE DIRECTOR,
SAMANTHA RIFE: ""MOM IS A DIRTY WORD"" is my dream project. As a
Mother of two, I've noticed a gap between the high-quality care and attention
moms and dads want to provide their children, and the reality. You don't have
to look further than your white picket fence to see that America becomes more
anti-family each year. From child-free businesses to the lack of support of
Mothers breastfeeding in public, moms and dads struggle uphill as they try to
stay competitive in the workforce, earning a living to support their family,
and provide the time and attention required to raise healthy children. Director, Samantha Rife
THIS IS YEAR THREE
of filming ""MOM IS A DIRTY WORD"". My team has shot over 50% of the
footage and we hope to rally our forces for the FINAL STRETCH HOME.
WHAT HAVE I LEARNED
SO FAR? Through my public policy research and many discussions with parents
and experts, it's clear that America is the only developed nation with
downright disregard for parents and caregivers. It's time family-positive
public policy is enacted, and for that we need YOUR SUPPORT.
YOUR INDIEGOGO
CONTRIBUTIONS give us the final financial and emotional push we need to
wrap up the film production phase for Summer 2016 and edit the film in Fall
2016.
WHY do we need your
SUPPORT?
Actually, you need this support too!
1. LACK OF
FAMILY-FRIENDLY PUBLIC POLICY
- Because you have a mom or love a mom.
- Because at one point in your life, whether you have
children or not - you (yes, YOU) are either going to be a caregiver (for a
child or aging parent), or a care receiver. 

You will want a job to return to if a loved one is ill or
you need to take time off to help an aging parent. Until we change public
policy to protect citizens who will be caregivers at one point in their lives,
we are all simply crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.
WHILE CERTAIN
COMPANIES OFFER PAID FAMILY LEAVE, A STIGMA PERSISTS…
Dozens of companies are extending paid family leave to many
of their employees (caveat - often with the exception of their call service
employees). Just some of these companies include: Facebook, Netflix, Amazon,
Hasbro, Twitter, Wells Fargo, and Yahoo. HOWEVER, although CEO Marissa Mayer
increased the company’s maternity leave from eight to 16 weeks, she only took two weeks paid leave after the birth of
her baby. What kind of message does that send to female Yahoo employees? Let’s
look at the numbers…
While 16 weeks of paid leave was offered, a mere 75% of
Yahoo female employees who had babies took the full 16-week leave. 
FIRST MONTHS ARE
CRITICAL - for the MOM and the NEWBORN
? 
Paid leave encourages breastfeeding and newborn
bonding.
? 
Paid family leave positively impacts infant outcomes
like birth weight and infant mortality.
? 
Plus… paid family leave increases the likelihood that
mothers will return to work and careers.
? 
As an example: California’s paid family leave has
actually INCREASED weekly hours and pay of mothers with 1- to 3-year-old
children by nearly 10%.
2. CULTURAL BIAS AT
THE WORKPLACE
Mothers are at a disadvantage in the workplace, facing
discrimination from hiring practices to starting salaries. Below are just some
of the ways mothers are treated unjustly in the workplace.
HIRING PRACTICES
MOTHERS ARE 79% LESS LIKELY TO BE HIRED THAN NON-MOTHERS OF
COMPARABLE QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE *Corell
and Bernard Cornell Study
“SHHHHHhhh, I’m a
Mother…”
When 192 study participants were asked to evaluate resumes
of equivalent experience and performance, there was no preference of one resume
over another. However, when a memo mentioning the applicant was a Mother of two
was added to some of the job applicant resumes, the study participants stated
they would hire 84% of the applicants without children, compared with only 47%
of the applicants that were Mothers.

STARTING SALARIES
When participants designated starting salaries to the
applicants in the Corell and Bernard study, participants proposed applicants
without children $11,000 more, on average than Mothers.
FEWER CALL-BACKS
Prospective employers are less likely to call back Mothers
for interviews when compared to applicants without children. 

MOTHERS VS. FATHERS
RECOMMENDED TO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS
Fathers are 1.83 times more likely to be recommended for
managerial positions than men without children.
Mothers are 8.2 times less likely to be recommended for
managerial positions than women without children.

3. OTHER TOPICS OF
DISCUSSION IN ""MOM IS A DIRTY WORD""
? 
The idea that as soon as women deliver, they're
encouraged to “shed the pregnancy weight,"" removing the scars a.k.a
""badges"" of Motherhood.
? 
The notion that women must ""do it all"" and
never complain, because that's unbecoming of a Mom and they must TAKE IT LIKE A WOMAN. Of course, this creates guilt
and a ""bad-Mommy"" complex.
? 
The discrimination against Mothers breastfeeding in
public.
? 
The controversial trend of ""child-free""
businesses and the increasing momentum of the ‘Ban the Brat’ and ‘No-Kid
Allowed’ movements.
? 
The rise in the popularity of ‘egg freezing’ among
women and employers.
? 
The increasing number of women opting out of having
children entirely and why.
? 
The sparsity of relatable Mothers in TV and film. Media
representations of mothers still reinforce the same stock characterizations
that existed in the 1950s – bad mothers vs. good mothers and that maternal
problems are not public but personal issues.
WE NEED YOU!
YOUR CHILDREN NEED
YOU!
YOUR CHILDREN’S
CHILDREN NEED YOU!
Your actions today can literally transform lives tomorrow.
IT'S TIME to stop punishing Moms who don't live up to that 1950 ideal. JOIN US
so we can film our final interviews and wrap production.
NO ONE listens to
moms.
- The media networks aren't listening.
- The politicians certainly aren't listening.
WILL YOU LISTEN?
REMEMBER... MOM ISN’T
A DIRTY WORD – Join the movement!

<div>PTSD sufferers in the media are generally depicted as male former servicemen. The reason for this is b<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ecause finally, a dialogue about PTSD affecting soldiers due to the horrors they are forced to endure as part of their service, has been gaining voices. Whilst this is very true and what most people are rightly trying to bring awareness too, we want to shift our focus ever so slightly to highlight the effects of PTSD on the everyday men, women and children who are also affected, as well as our service man and women. </span>
</div>
<div>They could be doctors, soldiers, police officers, teachers, parents. </div>

<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We want to be as transparent as possible so you can see exactly where your donation is going. </p>
<p><br/>- Location fees - This will be filmed in an around the local area (UK)  It costs money to procure a location so we have included this in our budget.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Actors' expenses -  As with any profession, the talent are going to get paid their fair rate and we've included an estimate for that in  our budget.</span><br/></p>
<p>- Music composer - We want to hire a music composer to set the tone with music that helps tell the story.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Colourist - We plan to be at as many festivals as possible so we need to ensure good post-production team members.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Props &amp; set design - This cost ensure our sets match the story tone including wardrobe, make up and props. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Film festivals (fees/etc) - Upon completion we will be entering the film festival market. Costs for this include fees for the festival, lodging, transportation and other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Each cost factored in is pivotal to accurately depicting the conflict within Joanna's mind and therefore exploring her story.<br/></span></p>

Let me tell you a little bit about the project, it's purpose and us!
Synopsis: A routine trip to the shop turns into a hellish nightmare for Joanna, as she is forced to battle the demons  occupying the darkest recesses of her mind.
""The Intruder"" is a visual tale depicting the harrowing effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Our goal is to shine a light on this serious issue that many people go through and are still scared to talk about. This is an issue present around us on a daily basis, living in the darkness. We believe that more awareness  should be made around PTSD and help those afflicted to speak about their experiences.
The film specifically explores the thought of being trapped inside your own mind.... and the consequences when that is a reality. We hope that you believe in our project as much as we do!

The script was written by award winning screenwriter Carly Street whose last short script, ""Fragile Storm"" starring Lance Henricksen (Aliens, Millennium) has won numerous awards on its festival run.


""It's an important topic which people need to understand is ok to talk about. There are too many people suffering in silence and it's disgusting that society continues to ignore the cries of help from the families of those affected.Hopefully we can shine a light on it and create a discussion to highlight support out there""  Carly Street, Screenwriter

We share the same passion for exploring delicate topics and real struggles and through the use of storytelling, we want to have a positive impact on society with this endearing short film.  


What's so different about this?

There are a lot of people trying to raise the profile of this topic currently, so what makes this project stand out? What's its unique selling point? 
PTSD sufferers in the media are generally depicted as male former servicemen. The reason for this is because finally, a dialogue about PTSD affecting soldiers due to the horrors they are forced to endure as part of their service, has been gaining voices. Whilst this is very true and what most people are rightly trying to bring awareness too, we want to shift our focus ever so slightly to highlight the effects of PTSD on the everyday men, women and children who are also affected, as well as our service man and women. 

They could be doctors, soldiers, police officers, teachers, parents. 
Every day ordinary people doing every day and ordinary things. 
This short will snapshot the ongoing cycle of PTSD for ALL of those people.

What's the money for?

We want to be as transparent as possible so you can see exactly where your donation is going. 
- Location fees - This will be filmed in an around the local area (UK)  It costs money to procure a location so we have included this in our budget.
- Actors' expenses -  As with any profession, the talent are going to get paid their fair rate and we've included an estimate for that in  our budget.
- Music composer - We want to hire a music composer to set the tone with music that helps tell the story.
- Colourist - We plan to be at as many festivals as possible so we need to ensure good post-production team members. This person helps to ensure the colour of each frame is perfect to help enhance the story and we've included this in our budget.
- Props & set design - This cost ensure our sets match the story tone including wardrobe, make up and props. 
- Film festivals (fees/etc) - Upon completion we will be entering the film festival market. Costs for this include fees for the festival, lodging, transportation and other expenses.
Each cost factored in is pivotal to accurately depicting the conflict within Joanna's mind and therefore exploring her story.
   Below is a chart depicting of the £4000 where the funds will be going.

As you can see, post production is a smaller colour. This is because we are dedicating this initial campaign  towards the filming to ensure we have the highest possible quality.
This is a phase one campaign. Once we have the footage, we will launch a secondary campaign which will be dedicated to festival entry and showing as well as post production essentials. This is an inDemand campaign because the more we raise, the more chance we don't have to launch a secondary campaign!

It's not just about donating though!
 
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help.
The main goal behind this film is to raise awareness about the subject matter. We want this film to create a discussion, to be a talking point. 

               So if you can't donate, please, please, please SHARE this page! 
                Share our facebook page and make some noise about PTSD! 
                                 www.facebook.com/TheIntruderShort

We will be providing links and working with charities to assist anyone who is affected by PTSD. It can happen to anyone at any time and is a silent killer. 
We need to give those affected a voice and a place to seek help and support so it's so important that we get the message out and the discussion started.
Any questions?
We believe in building a genuine film community so if you want to ask any questions or talk about the project please feel free to get in touch! 
Just scan the messenger code below or mosey on down to Facebook!
We are all so passionate about this subject matter, we will not go quietly into the night!",2.0,1,"10 Campaigns

</p><p><b>The Awakening</b></p>
<p><span>  Thanks for checking out my
campaign!  My name is Tom and I'm the
owner of T Mac Imaging.  I have been a
photographer and videographer in the metro Detroit area for about 6 years.  I've done mostly lifestyle, landscape, and
local band pictures along with a few music and lyric videos.  I've also done camera work for some local
short films.</span></p>
<p><span>  Recently, I had an idea for my first
short film.  After writing a rough draft
of the screenplay I shared it with a few friends of mine that are involved in
filmmaking.  They all said it would be a
great festival entry and asked if they could have a role.  That settled it for me!</span></p>
<p><span>  As a child I used to take my
father's 8mm movie camera and direct my friends through made up scenes without
any film.  Many stories have come and
gone over the years, but none have moved me to the point of needing to shoot it
until now.  The Awakening is actually the
first project I've written that's made it beyond my word processor.</span></p>
<p><b>Let's Cut to the Chase</b></p>
<p><span>  We both know why I'm here. I'm asking
you to donate funds to help me make this short film.  Being self employed in a highly over
saturated market makes it tough to make ends meet.  I rarely have “spare” cash, let alone enough
to make a movie without help.  Don't
think you won't get anything for your donations though, I've got some special
perks planned to make it fun and worthwhile for everyone involved!</span></p>
<p><span>  To bring my vision of this movie to
life, I've set a goal of $2000.  Quite an
amount for a short, but I have a vision that I want to stay true to.  The funds will go towards location scouting,
rental of locations (if needed), shooting permits where required, rental of
lighting and effects equipment, an original score, some of the perks, and of
course to pay for the feeding and care of the cast and crew.</span></p>
<p><span>  Now before I ask you to hand over
your hard earned dough, I'm going to give you a little more insight into the
meat of my project.  The Awakening is a
short film that falls into the horror/thriller genre, similar to an episode of
The Twilight Zone.  In its 5 minute
running time, I hope it will shock and entertain the audience as well as make a
poignant comment on modern society.</span></p>
<p><span>  Now for what you get if you
donate!  Feel free to donate any amount
and I'll give you a personal thanks both on this page and the facebook page I
plan on creating for this project.  Let
me break down the “perks” for you.</span></p>

make it a festival film.  Entry of a
short film into a festival isn't costly, but you have to be there to represent
your film, or any awards will be forfeit. 
That means ticket(s) to the festival, transportation, lodging, food, and
other expenses.  </span></p>
<p><span>  I'm hoping this movie, short as it
is, will have quite an impact on people and make them reconsider how their

What is About Wings?
I’m Robin, a tea addict, travelling through Europe in my van, Hermes. Well, recently my boyfriend has joined in in Spain.

We document our journey with the video series “About Wings” and aim to inspire others to go on their own adventures.

And so far, we have been successful: Besides the amazing emails from fans, we also got attention from well known Youtubers and even BBC World.Why do we need Your Help?

But now we ran into a new challenge:
Hermes doesn’t have proper ventilation, which leads to mould. Also, he is simply too small for TWO people and you can’t cook inside. I'm afraid it is soon time to give Hermes some rest from all the travelling and get a new, bigger van.

Working hard, I now have more money on my account than ever before. But we are still far from reaching what we need for our new van-home... And proper vans are not cheap in Europe.

I started this crowdfunding campaign in hope for your wish for About Wings not to end, just as it has started.What's in for You?

I have produced the series for - let’s be fair, pretty much for free - and I want to keep it this way. After all, I can see how much it benefits my audience. Season ONE is completely filmed and I am currently releasing Episodes on a weekly basis.

If you would enjoy to see Season TWO, we will need a new van. And You can Help!Whether it is 500€ or as simple as 10€, your donation makes our next adventure possible and brings it right to your homely screen!

I know we aren't too big of a crowd yet, but I also know that every single one of you can make one hell of a difference in your’s, as well as in other people's lives!


So, please share this message, give some money and we will finally move on towards North, by May!Thank you all so much!Robin",6.0,1,"2 Campaigns

for us to purchase our own equipment.</p><p>
Some of the equipment we would be buying includes a camera, audio equipment,

begin to shoot some preliminary scenes of our first film.</p><p>We are about to head into pre-production of our very first film, Calling All Dakota's. This film, centered around a writer who is the victim of relentless bullying, demonstrates the hardships of high school that people face, and all the help you can provide us will not only jump start our business, but also our newest film that will bring awareness to a serious problem in high schools around the world. As part of our campaign, we are using some of the money for this project as well. </p><p>Calling All Dakotas is a film, as previously stated, that highlights the impacts of bullying in all different forms. this movie, which provides a powerful message to all generations, has been selected to be shown at select high school as part of the anti-bullying campaign.

obstacles they face, what drives and sustains them, how they measure success of
an endeavor they will not live to see completed. But most of all we discover
that their lives really aren’t that different from everyone else’s: who hasn’t
gazed at the stars and wondered if we are unique, nurtured botanicals, sought
ideal shelter, fell in love with a song and exposed someone to it? And who among
us will truly see our work finished before we leave this mortal coil? The film

</div></div>","The campaign is over, but you can still support A Life's Work by going to the New York Foundation for the Arts' sponsorship page.
Eleven years ago I committed to making a documentary about
people working on projects they won’t see completed in their lifetimes,
projects that could have a profound, positive global impact. Ten years ago we
started shooting A Life’s Work with an eye towards theatrical screenings and television broadcast. Today, A Life’s Work is nearing the finish line
and I’m asking for your support to complete the film and get it out into the
world!
Production resulted in gorgeous footage and insightful
interviews. Editing was time consuming and meticulous, but it paid off. Now I
want to make sure that I can hire top-notch people for sound editing, mixing,
scoring, color correcting, and finishing so that A Life’s Work will be the best
it can be. 
   


What’s
it like to dedicate your life to work that won’t be completed in your lifetime?

To find out, I focused on four projects and the
people behind them. The subjects are: 

Paolo Soleri, the recently deceased
architect behind Arcosanti, a complex based on his theories of urban planning
that has been under construction since 1970, and his successor, Jeff Stein,
AIA. 


Jill Tarter, astronomer and Director of the SETI Institute, who has been
involved in the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence since the
1970s and who was the basis for the Ellie Arroway character in Carl Sagan’s
science fiction novel, Contact.



David and Jared Milarch, father and son tree farmers and co-founders of the
Champion Tree Project (recently renamed Archangel Ancient Tree Archive), who
clone old-growth trees for long-term reforestation projects.


Robert Darden, a gospel music archivist and journalism professor at Baylor University who
founded the Black Gospel Music Restoration Project, an organization that is
trying to identify, preserve, digitize, and catalog all of the most at-risk
recordings from the black gospel music tradition.  



We discover what inspired them to begin, what
obstacles they face, what drives and sustains them, how they measure success of
an endeavor they will not live to see completed. But most of all we discover
that their lives really aren’t that different from everyone else’s: who hasn’t
gazed at the stars and wondered if we are unique, nurtured botanicals, sought
ideal shelter, fell in love with a song and exposed someone to it? And who among
us will truly see our work finished before we leave this mortal coil? The film
is an examination of the nature of service to a cause greater than oneself, a
contemplation on passion, devotion, continuity, and legacy. In an ADHD,
soundbite world, A Life’s Work invites you to slow down and consider the value
of taking the long view.




Reach millions through theatrical screenings, television broadcast, and online distribution;

Reveal the value of, and
necessity for, long-term thinking;

Reveal through the
life of the subjects what it means to devote a life to something beyond “self,”
or as Robert Darden says in the film, to be ""caught up in something a lot
bigger than themselves”;

Inspire
people to investigate the subjects' work;


Inspire people to consider what their
legacy will be, and consider how that legacy can be the most positive it can
be. 




I know reaching these goals won't be a walk in the park, but I've had support from amazing people thus far, people who are among the best at what they do. If the monetary goal of $30,000 is met, the film will be completed in early 2017. If the stretch goal of $35,000 is met, the percentage taken by IndieGoGo and NYFA will be taken care of. If the superstretch goal of $40,000 is met, it will pay for an editor to make a  60-minute cut for television broadcast. If the superduperstretch goal of $45,000 is met, the composer will be paid a fair rate. If the superduperSUPER stretch goal of $50,000 is met, it will pay for E&O (Errors & Omissions) insurance and the  the ALW crowd funding team. Distribution of funds, $30,000 goal met.
Distribution of funds, SuperEnormo stretch goal of $50,000 met.

NEW PERK: Polaroid Photos  (Analog!) of the Oldest Trees in the World
I took these when I shot the bristlecone pine trees in the White Mountains, CA. Only seven of these were taken, and one is already spoken for. Support of $70 and one can be yours.
Polaroid no longer makes film, but a company called the Impossible Project does. These were taken while IP was trying to perfect their film, hence the washed out colors and the brown splotches on them. These photos are very sensitive and will fade if they are exposed to even low levels of light. If you want to display them, speak to a framer about UV glass.
I can't stress how unique these are, especially in these days of digital photography.

I’ve always loved writing. I also have a love for the human language, whether it is verbal or physical I love observing the art of communication between people.

I am the writer and producer of Concrete. I’ve been an actress for many years now but even before that I was a writer. My earliest works date back to age 13 and they consist of poetry, short stories and over 30 unproduced screenplays. All of which star women as the protagonist and heroin of each amazing adventure. I’ve always loved writing. I also have a love for the human language, whether it is verbal or physical I love observing the art of communication between people. This is why my love of writing also translated into a love of acting. My most recent work is the new film, The Congressman  and I am currently starring in a Haitian independent film, Free Will. For more on my acting check out my website.   http://www.dominiquelafleur.com/ When I’m not in front of the camera working, I’m behind it working as a staff at a boutique Haitian production company Saturn Visions Productions.
