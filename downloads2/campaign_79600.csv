<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When I wrote </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Eve's Garden</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, I hoped that it would remind readers of times when they have felt like outsiders.

<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Eve's Garden </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">i</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">s the story of a Romani-American girl discovering her identity in a North Georgia mill town. Through her journey into the family's past, Eve also learns about the </span>journey<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of the Romani people from India to spread across the world, and how her own family came </span>to<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>America<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> as slaves and survived to found a vibrant community. It's an uplifting and very intimate story of a Romani family, their devotion to one another, their determination to retain their identity, and the network of friends who support them. I'm grateful that it has been </span>well-received by <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">audiences and critics. (You can find some of the reviews and comments <a href=""http://www.glendabaileymershon.com/about-eves-garden.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a>)</span></p>
<p>I have had so many invitations to read from the book and to speak on Romani history and culture, that I have put together a Powerpoint presentation that I have used at Trine University and will use again at Wake Forest University and NYU in New York City. We have further invitations from colleges and universities in New Jersey and California, as well as bookstores and community centers.</p>
<p>In order to introduce future audiences to further stories about the Roma, our history, and current issues, I have invited as collaborator my friend, Vadim Kolpakov, one of our most well-known Romani musicians, who is also an educator, and with whom I've completed projects in the past. (The book's trailer includes music by Vadim's ensemble, Via Romen. You can see the trailer by clicking on the photo at the top of <a href=""http://www.glendabaileymershon.com/about-eves-garden.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this page</a>.) His music adds immeasurably to the program and his knowledge of Romani culture as an immigrant complements my experience growing up in the United States. </p>
<p>Vadim and I will combine readings from <i>Eve's Garden</i> with varied styles of Romani music and take the resulting performance on tour to places where readings have not yet occurred, particularly to California and New York City in the summer of 2015. For our audiences, we will provide more information through the slide presentation about the Romani people, including music, art, and history, so that participants will leave with a clear understanding of past and present realities of the Romani experience. These will be readings, concerts, and parties combined, and I guarantee people will leave not only better informed, but also entertained!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We hope to perform the enhanced readings in at least three to five bookstores, plus community centers and other venues on the West Coast and in New York, where we will be heard by a wide cross-section of the public.

<p></p>
<p>My frequent flier miles are gone!</p>
<p>Success has brought a dilemma: Although we have many invitations to speak and perform, we cannot easily get to all the spots, and the organizers of most venues are unable to offer travel expenses.

<p>Unfortunately, accessible places where the performances can have the most impact, like bookstores and libraries, can't provide fees to help us get there or to pay other expenses on the way, and neither can the small press that published the novel. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">Two summers ago, I spent a week sleeping in a Romani Gypsy caravan at Samois sur Seine, 
France, and absorbing the chunk-chunk-chunk rhythmic 
guitar strokes laid out under the spider-like solos weaving together.




 <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448734914/oyykjlwm3r6grd9nnlpj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 623.476px; height: 466px;""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The trip to France included a stay at a Parisian artist colony,
 where I stayed up late night with a resident painter.  We sat in the candlelight making art,
 him sketching and me working out chords for the song Pulses (which will be on 'Grace').  I
 then went to London and I cycled around the city throughout the night with one of my collaborators on the 
album, the electronic producer SLSTCE, whom I had met at the Django Festival campground in France.  I stayed with a visual artist, who explained to me at her studio how she
 is hypersensitive to what she sees; in observing a blade of grass, for example, she sees various shapes and shades of green.  Her insight is the impetus behind the lyrics for 'Pulses': <br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I taught my eyes to love / I gave my heart / I carried what I saw / In my arms</i><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Prior to this, I trained to be an opera singer in Canada, 
the US, Austria, and Italy.       I think of the
rehearsal rooms with pianos inviting you to get lost in them;  I think of the iconic melody in 'Clair de lune' by Debussy and the German Lieder I sang by Schumann, Schubert, and Brahms... <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448953539/xloz1y8o30xskte2imim.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of those German Lieder has made its way to my new body of work.  Appearing in many composer's works as a muse, 'Mignon' is a character in a German romantic novel by Goethe.  She's a young girl singing about her exotic homeland, and I took a stab at an interpretation of her song:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Do you know that path on the high mountainside / Where warmer winds blow when mists divide? / A dragon rears its brood in the far ancient cave / And torrents flow over river rock // <br/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Do you know that land? / Do you know that land? / Do you know that land? // There would I go with you!</i><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">During my opera studies, I'd go out to hear electronic, jazz, and world music.  I also worked with the digital composition studio at McGill University, feeling a strong desire to explore digital technology within music.  I needed to know how to combine my experiences.  I searched for this in Montreal and Berlin, and when I decided to move to New York City, I searched for it here, too.  <br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448734401/yc304cu3phych3hbygjk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 617.11px; height: 615px;""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I became an apprentice audio engineer at a recording 
studio.  At about the same time, I discovered Gypsy jazz and started performing gig after gig.  I split this work many 
nights throughout the week, and weeks turned into years.  The trip to Samois and London happened as a consequence of this.  <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In my new music, look for traditional Gypsy jazz guitar solos weaving through 
electronic beats.  Gypsy jazz guitar recordings are also chopped and 
layered to create percussive elements, taking the idea of the 
traditional rhythm guitar and using it as a modern music production

France, and absorbing the chunk-chunk-chunk rhythmic 
guitar strokes laid out under the spider-like solos weaving together.




 The trip to France included a stay at a Parisian artist colony,
 where I stayed up late night with a resident painter.  We sat in the candlelight making art,
 him sketching and me working out chords for the song Pulses (which will be on 'Grace').  I
 then went to London and I cycled around the city throughout the night with one of my collaborators on the 
album, the electronic producer SLSTCE, whom I had met at the Django Festival campground in France.  I stayed with a visual artist, who explained to me at her studio how she
 is hypersensitive to what she sees; in observing a blade of grass, for example, she sees various shapes and shades of green.  Her insight is the impetus behind the lyrics for 'Pulses': I taught my eyes to love / I gave my heart / I carried what I saw / In my armsPrior to this, I trained to be an opera singer in Canada, 
the US, Austria, and Italy.       I think of the
rehearsal rooms with pianos inviting you to get lost in them;  I think of the iconic melody in 'Clair de lune' by Debussy and the German Lieder I sang by Schumann, Schubert, and Brahms... One of those German Lieder has made its way to my new body of work.  Appearing in many composer's works as a muse, 'Mignon' is a character in a German romantic novel by Goethe.  She's a young girl singing about her exotic homeland, and I took a stab at an interpretation of her song:Do you know that path on the high mountainside / Where warmer winds blow when mists divide? / A dragon rears its brood in the far ancient cave / And torrents flow over river rock // Do you know that land? / Do you know that land? / Do you know that land? // There would I go with you!During my opera studies, I'd go out to hear electronic, jazz, and world music.  I also worked with the digital composition studio at McGill University, feeling a strong desire to explore digital technology within music.  I needed to know how to combine my experiences.  I searched for this in Montreal and Berlin, and when I decided to move to New York City, I searched for it here, too.  I became an apprentice audio engineer at a recording 
studio.  At about the same time, I discovered Gypsy jazz and started performing gig after gig.  I split this work many 
nights throughout the week, and weeks turned into years.  The trip to Samois and London happened as a consequence of this.  In my new music, look for traditional Gypsy jazz guitar solos weaving through 
electronic beats.  Gypsy jazz guitar recordings are also chopped and 
layered to create percussive elements, taking the idea of the 
traditional rhythm guitar and using it as a modern music production 
rhythmic element.  Classical piano and violin are reinterpreted as synthesizer 
keyboard arrangements and sampled orchestrations.  Electronic beats provide textures and a groove. The pop music part points to the song structures. Music is a beautiful thing.  It opens doors and affords us the opportunity to know one another in a unique kind of way.  Music transcends in a world where everybody's looking for peace and everyone is longing for love.  Music
 in itself is a connection worth pursuing. This idea flew out of my hands on the guitar to create my song 'Morning'.  Imagining the future lead to this certain sense of longing:Morning, how long you've lived / Across my eyelids / All that I hoped to give / I lost in my blindness // Such a beautiful morning / And the sand will only know / Until the rocks melt with the sun / What blooming hearts and hands will growCollaborators

<p>The Harms is: <b>Chase Frank, Jennifer Monsees, Jessica Alexander</b>.  I, Chase started The Harms in January 2012 at the suggestion of long-time friend Ikey Owens.   I was writing a bunch of new stuff that sounded different than anything I'd previously done.  Surfy 60's / 70's garage with some other influences that really had a specific energy.  Dark &amp; poppy?  Yes!  Frenetic, driving &amp; fun?  Yes.  This was very different than my solo work.<br/></p>
<p>It was a ""project"" (complete with rotating memberships).  We dropped our first single (""Take The Elevator"" / ""House The Sun"") in 2013, with help from Producer Ikey Owens.  Musically, it worked.  The analog recording captured  a 'harms energy'.  The momentum translated into another recording -- a 7 song EP with the addition of permanent member Jennifer Monsees in 2013.  <br/>listen here <a href=""http://theharms.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://theharms.bandcamp.com</a></p>

<p>Graveyard Love is our first acoustic recording.  It's possibly our most requested song.  It's about a vampire suicide pact. It has a Nick Cave meets Jenny Lewis feel with the crystalline vocals of Jennifer Monsees.  Sound Dragons has a 70's psych feel -- fast, riff driven, crazy psych break, respectively.  It explores how melodies revisit us throughout time -- a magical subject for musicians.<br/></p>
<p><i>""Graveyard Love</i>"" and <i>""Sound Dragons""</i> were slated to be recorded in Nashville late 2014 with Ikey Owens.  Sadly our friend and Producer, Ikey Owens suffered a fatal heart attack.  We pulled our thoughts together and re-grouped to make our goal happen.I was heartbroken; he was a friend for 17 years. I thought, we have to do these songs. Now it's also for Ikey.<br/></p>
<p>We recorded the two songs in January 2014 at the The 
Recording Conservatory of Austin with producer <b>Alec Esh </b>&amp; Engineer 
<b>Jet Jaguar.</b>  We had conversations with Ikey as a guide.  We knew we wanted to be in a quality studio with the right gear.  I knew we had to step up production sound and quality.<br/><br/>So, YES!  We've done possibly the hardest part.  The songs sound great.  Now we need your help to complete the process, mastering &amp; vinyl reproduction.  With guests like <b>Joseph Woullard </b>&amp;<b> Claude 9 </b> on ""<i>Sound Dragons</i>"", and the love and expertise of all the folks during the session, we know you'll be just as excited as we are about the tracks!<br/><br/></p>

<p>Zedcon is the world´s  smartest and most functional LED controller. It allows you to connect multiple LED strips and control them via your smartphone in an incredibly easy way.</p>
<p>Zedcon is the only controller that lets you address every LED individually and takes full advantage of the abilities of digital LED strips. This opens up an entire world of use cases, which make Zedcon much more than just a ""LED controller"".</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">The Basics</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">RGB LEDs can shine in over 16 million different colors. LEDs have a very slim form-factor and consume far less energy than other lighting solutions which saves you money. Our free app allows you to dim them and of course to switch them on and off. Oh, and if you want to use a standard light switch - this works as well!</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Moving Lights</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Common LED strips can light up in every color of the rainbow — but only one color at a time. This is the principal difference to our digital LED strips, where every single LED can be lit up with its own color, while leaving the others unaffected. Zedcon takes full advantage of digital LED strips, by letting you address every single LED on an individual basis.  This functionality is important for creating nuanced atmospheres and dynamic light conditions.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Set the Mood</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While we may have some control over the intensity of light that surrounds us, we have next to no control over its color. Zedcon can not only to light up your room, but also to give it a certain atmosphere and ambience. The ability to impact your mood, as well as that of the people around you, is a very powerful one –whether you want to create an energetic mood to help you get your work done or relax at the end of a productive day.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Connect Sound to Light</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apart from light, music is the other major external stimulus that can make or break our mood. In fact it was our fascination with combining light and music that brought us into the world of LEDs in the first place. This is why we built a microphone, as well as a music-processing chip into the Zedcon. These components enable the Zedcon to analyse the music that’s being played and transform it into light patterns on the digital LED strips. Thanks to these features, being a light-jockey has never been easier.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Smart Timer</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Set individual timer for each occasion. Use the Zedcon to develop healthy routines by configuring it to execute time-specific commands. Instead of waking up to the sound of the alarm clock, you can wake up to the soft glow of your bedroom light. At the appointed hour, your Zedcon can be set to mimic a slow, warm sunrise, regardless of how grey the weather actually is. It can also be set to dim the lights in your child’s room when bedtime draws near. The smart timer works for any other lightsignal stored in the cloud.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Create Event Notifications</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Get a light alert as a reminder for an upcoming meeting or for a missed call. As soon as washing machines start connecting to the internet, the completion of a washing cycle can also be followed by a subtle light signal. As the IoT grows to encompass more and more devices, so will the value of Zedcon grow along with it.

</div>","Meet Zedcon

Zedcon is the world´s  smartest and most functional LED controller. It allows you to connect multiple LED strips and control them via your smartphone in an incredibly easy way.
Zedcon is the only controller that lets you address every LED individually and takes full advantage of the abilities of digital LED strips. This opens up an entire world of use cases, which make Zedcon much more than just a ""LED controller"".



Features



The Basics
RGB LEDs can shine in over 16 million different colors. LEDs have a very slim form-factor and consume far less energy than other lighting solutions which saves you money. Our free app allows you to dim them and of course to switch them on and off. Oh, and if you want to use a standard light switch - this works as well!





Moving Lights
Common LED strips can light up in every color of the rainbow — but only one color at a time. This is the principal difference to our digital LED strips, where every single LED can be lit up with its own color, while leaving the others unaffected. Zedcon takes full advantage of digital LED strips, by letting you address every single LED on an individual basis.  This functionality is important for creating nuanced atmospheres and dynamic light conditions.



Use Cases


Set the Mood
While we may have some control over the intensity of light that surrounds us, we have next to no control over its color. Zedcon can not only to light up your room, but also to give it a certain atmosphere and ambience. The ability to impact your mood, as well as that of the people around you, is a very powerful one –whether you want to create an energetic mood to help you get your work done or relax at the end of a productive day.





Connect Sound to Light
Apart from light, music is the other major external stimulus that can make or break our mood. In fact it was our fascination with combining light and music that brought us into the world of LEDs in the first place. This is why we built a microphone, as well as a music-processing chip into the Zedcon. These components enable the Zedcon to analyse the music that’s being played and transform it into light patterns on the digital LED strips. Thanks to these features, being a light-jockey has never been easier.






Smart Timer
Set individual timer for each occasion. Use the Zedcon to develop healthy routines by configuring it to execute time-specific commands. Instead of waking up to the sound of the alarm clock, you can wake up to the soft glow of your bedroom light. At the appointed hour, your Zedcon can be set to mimic a slow, warm sunrise, regardless of how grey the weather actually is. It can also be set to dim the lights in your child’s room when bedtime draws near. The smart timer works for any other lightsignal stored in the cloud.





Create Event Notifications
Get a light alert as a reminder for an upcoming meeting or for a missed call. As soon as washing machines start connecting to the internet, the completion of a washing cycle can also be followed by a subtle light signal. As the IoT grows to encompass more and more devices, so will the value of Zedcon grow along with it.




Easy to use





Where is zedcon useful?


Home
Mood lighting is the most important usage scenario for the Zedcon. Use it to light up your living space according how you feel – or how you want to feel. Automate the Zedcon so you have specific light conditions for specific times of day.




Office
In addition to the huge energy savings Zedcon’s mood lighting features are very useful in conference rooms. Choose for example between a productive or a more creative lighting. Negotiations with clients, team meetings and feedback sessions can all be made much more pleasant if the right atmosphere is created. Use zedcon to visualize KPIs that matter for your business through light notifications.




Bars and Clubs
Creating just the right atmosphere has never been easier than with the Zedcon. In addition, Zedcon can be used to create impressive light shows in party locations.



How to place LEDs right?
You are still wondering where to place LED strips? We collected a few examples for you to stimulate your creativity. And remember, strips go where bulbs can´t!





Technology


The Advantages of the cloud



 
The first controller that stores its data in the cloud. This allows for limitless updates and therefore limitless lighting possibilities.
 





Networking



 
Connect multiple Zedcons to a network and name them to control them simultaneously or individually.
 





Internet of Things



 
The Internet of Things (or ‘IoT’ for short) allows standalone devices to interact with each other, as long as they can both connect to the Internet. Zedcon is the first LED Controller that takes advantage of the IoT movement. Due to the Internet connection Zedcon is able to interact with every other internet-connected device you own.

</div><p></p><h3>The Mission</h3><p>We are Denver-based power folk duo Whitherward - Ash on the left, Ed on the right - and we have a mission this summer.  A full-fledged, multi-city, two and a half month tour across (some) of the United States of America.  This is a mammoth undertaking for us, and we've already started the ball rolling with a fantastic booking campaign.</p><h3>Here's Where We Stand</h3><div>The tour is shaping up to be a wonderful jaunt through most of the American West, Midwest, and some of the South.  Some information:<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>31 shows booked so far July - mid September</li>
<li>States booked: Colorado, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Illinois, Tennessee</li>
<li>States we're working on: South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, New Mexico</li>
</ul>
<div>The main purpose of the tour is to further grow our fanbase and kick off our full-time music career.  For reals, this time.  And we need your help to get off the launchpad successfully.<p></p>
</div>
</div><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Touring full-time takes a lot of stamina, fortitude, and determination.  As it happens, it also needs money.  A number of our shows pay us money, and we'll make some extra through tips and merchandise sales, but it still may not be enough.  According to our estimates, it will take about $10,000 to account for the following items:</p><ul>
<li>Vehicle costs</li>
<li>Vehicle maintenance</li>
<li>Fuel costs</li>
<li>Food &amp; lodging</li>
<li>Bills</li>
<li>Tour promotion</li>
</ul><div>We'll use the funds as needed, based on what we get in money from shows along the way, but your contribution will be what puts us over the top and ensures the tour's success.<p></p>
</div><p></p><h3>The Roles We Take</h3><p>Whitherward is many things - acoustic duo, business, brand, philosophy - and we do everything ourselves. Running a band as a business is a full-time job for us and, as such, we've forgone our day jobs in order to focus on this job. A lot of work goes into what we do, and we take on a number of roles ourselves that most businesses have entire teams for:</p><ul>
<li>Ash acts as the primary booking agent for our performances, with Ed helping from time to time. She also maintains contact with fans and business associates alike through social media and traditional contact methods.</li>
<li>Ed handles a number of backend technical jobs as well as working on recordings and video production.</li>
<li>Both of us handle financial planning and management, promotion, R&amp;D, and, of course, the musical aspect of the duo.</li>
</ul><div>As you can see, we juggle a lot of jobs between us. Being self-employed brings freedom and tremendous challenge, and we love having the option of blazing our own path in the ever-changing music industry.<p></p>
</div><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The reality on the road is, anything can happen.  Vehicles break down, gigs are double-booked or outright cancelled, sleep is in short supply due to travel deadlines, and any number of things outside of our control can affect our ability to perform.</p><p>However, our resolve is bolstered from your support; we love our fans, and we appreciate seeing them smile, mouthing the words of our songs as we sing, and chatting with them to the wee hours.

31 shows booked so far July - mid September
States booked: Colorado, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Illinois, Tennessee
States we're working on: South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, New Mexico

The main purpose of the tour is to further grow our fanbase and kick off our full-time music career.  For reals, this time.  And we need your help to get off the launchpad successfully.

What We Need & What You GetTouring full-time takes a lot of stamina, fortitude, and determination.  As it happens, it also needs money.  A number of our shows pay us money, and we'll make some extra through tips and merchandise sales, but it still may not be enough.  According to our estimates, it will take about $10,000 to account for the following items:
Vehicle costs
Vehicle maintenance
Fuel costs
Food & lodging
Bills
Tour promotion
We'll use the funds as needed, based on what we get in money from shows along the way, but your contribution will be what puts us over the top and ensures the tour's success.
The Roles We TakeWhitherward is many things - acoustic duo, business, brand, philosophy - and we do everything ourselves. Running a band as a business is a full-time job for us and, as such, we've forgone our day jobs in order to focus on this job. A lot of work goes into what we do, and we take on a number of roles ourselves that most businesses have entire teams for:
Ash acts as the primary booking agent for our performances, with Ed helping from time to time. She also maintains contact with fans and business associates alike through social media and traditional contact methods.
Ed handles a number of backend technical jobs as well as working on recordings and video production.
Both of us handle financial planning and management, promotion, R&D, and, of course, the musical aspect of the duo.
As you can see, we juggle a lot of jobs between us. Being self-employed brings freedom and tremendous challenge, and we love having the option of blazing our own path in the ever-changing music industry.
Risks & ChallengesThe reality on the road is, anything can happen.  Vehicles break down, gigs are double-booked or outright cancelled, sleep is in short supply due to travel deadlines, and any number of things outside of our control can affect our ability to perform.However, our resolve is bolstered from your support; we love our fans, and we appreciate seeing them smile, mouthing the words of our songs as we sing, and chatting with them to the wee hours. This is why we assume great risk in touring full time, and we wouldn't have it any other way.  It's a grueling life, but for us, it's the only life. And now, you can have a part in helping us realize our dream.Other Ways You Can HelpSpreading the word is the biggest help to our campaign possible. Tell your friends, send emails to your co-workers, and post this campaign link on all of your social media pages so that as many people as possible can learn about us and what we want to do!Thank you for your support, and we'll see you on the road!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

vocal career has been researching and performing classical vocal works by
composers of color.  My desire to follow
this path was influenced by the famous American lyric baritone, Thomas Hampson
and his Song of America project.  I first
saw his recital back in the 1980’s when I had just begun my vocal studies in
earnest.  I still carry the memory of
sitting in Kleinhans Music Hall reading his program notes and wondering why
there was no mention of any Black-American composer or a spiritual on the
program.  It was then the seed was
planted in my heart.</p>
<p>  I find it disheartening that in today’s
world of fingertip access to knowledge and the unknown that the contributions
of Blacks in the world of classical music continues to be marginalized to that
of a few symphonic works and the Negro Spiritual.  There is a plethora of vocal music, including
opera that provides a colorful landscape beyond that of the majority.  Many of these works use the poems of writers
of color and thereby presents the facets of life from a different lens, one
that is no less important than that presented in the standard repertoire.  </p>
<p>  To provide a little background as to why I
decided to record a CD.  There are
certain pivotal moments in our lives that are forever ingrained in our
memory.  One of these moments for me
occurred on Sept. 15, 2013.  As I was
working on my computer in preparation of an upcoming recital, the thought came
to me, “Rae-Myra you should record a CD featuring the works you have been
championing and to program those works to give a picturesque landscape of your
life”.  The idea of a ‘scape’, a scene or
a view resonated in my conscience. 
Hence the title, <b><i>Lifescapes: One Woman’s Journey</i></b>.  </p>
<p>  As a Christian, I will always include
sacred works and spirituals on any recital I program.  These proclamations of my faith and fears
will begin and end the CD.  The works by
H. Leslie Adams, <b>Nightsongs</b>, depicts
life as a survivor of all things associated with the night and darkness and the
beauty that comes out of that.  <b>Beyond the Rim of Day</b> is the story of
one woman’s desperate life from birth to death. 
The two works of Regina Harris Baiocchi are a dichotomy of Black
artistic life.  One in which the artist
doesn’t see her color within the confines of race and the other from the
patrons’ view of lack of appreciation received. 
The song cycle of Dr. Valerie Capers, <b>Song of the Seasons</b>, is picturesque journey through the seasons of
life where death merely brings about new life. 
The aria by William Grant Still from his opera <b>Troubled Island</b>, is the cry of the human spirit to be free from its
imposed prison.</p>
<p>  The style of these compositions range from
romantic, jazz, blues, gospel and atonal. 
Just as Mr. Hampson promoted his findings through a recital tour, it is
my mission to introduce these works to as many willing and accepting audiences
as possible.  It is my plan to use the
recording to market a recital tour to colleges and universities across the
United States.  Whereas I am not the
first to have done such a compilation – hats off to my influences:  Dr. Darryl Taylor, Dr. Louise Toppin, Dr.
Robert Sims and Randye Jones - I am a part of a small community of artists.</p>
<p>  The songs I have chosen
are a small sample of the works that have been introduced to and researched by
me.  With the number of songs I have in
my library still to learn and the number of songs on my wish list to purchase,
my journey will be fruitful and, prayerfully, long.</p><br/></div>","Over the past two decades, the focus of my

<p>Alaskapella started July 2011 as a group of a cappella singers affiliated with the University of Alaska Southeast. The purpose was to bring more music to the University and the Juneau community. The group was open to both college students at the University and to non-student members of the local community. Over the years, Alaskapella has fluctuated between its starting point of four members and thirty-five members (with choristers coming and going  in the group as their schedule allowed). Today we stand at an anticipated traveling number of eighteen members. Over the four years that Alaskapella has been around, we have performed at at least two major concerts of our own per year, various short gigs for local organizations, performances with other singing groups in their concerts, and we have worked to promote music in the community and at the University. All of this hard work, practice, and love of music has brought us to a wonderful opportunity (see “Carnegie Hall”)! </p>
<p>However, as Alaskapella is a group of both current college students with the University and non-student members (such as alumni and those taking time off from school due to various reasons), we cannot travel through the college (as the whole group) due to current University policy. Therefore, with the University’s blessing, we are attempting to travel as a group of individuals, hence the reason we are calling ourselves Alaskapellicans and not Alaskapella (the name owned by the University). Over the years, the pelican has become our mascot and our term to define individual group members, which seemed to fit with our current concept of a group of traveling individuals. We are currently a club under the University Foundation (a not-for-profit organization) and use all money earned through donations to represent the University and state of Alaska, provide our members with the best possible  experience (e.g. new uniforms, etc), and enlarge our music repertoire so we can bring a wider range of music to the community. </p>
<p>Carnegie Hall in New York City!</p>
<p>Alaskapella has been invited by DCINY (Distinguished Concerts International New York) to go to New York City and perform in an a cappella chorus directed by Deke Sharon (Music Director/arranger of Pitch Perfect and producer/arranger/and vocal coach on the Sing Off) in an international program/performance experience called Total Vocal 2. We were discovered by one of the DCINY employees on YouTube and the organization extended an invitation to us to come to New York and join them for the event! This is quite the honor as only the best a cappella groups around the world are invited to join in this amazing experience. Alaskapella is going to great lengths to try and make sure we can attend this opportunity, as we are excited to represent Alaska, the Juneau community, and the University of Alaska (and hope to further our group’s musical prowess to become a better representative for all mentioned parties). The Juneau Arts and Humanities Council has graciously joined us to help reach this goal in our fundraising efforts. For this event, we would be traveling to New York City in March of 2016 from the 17th through the 21st (with the 17th and 21st being travel days). This is so that we can rehearse with the other groups and Deke Sharon to polish our sound and the group in time for the  main performance (on Sunday, the 20th of March). There will be about eighteen of us traveling and performing in this event, but there will also be some VIPs (people who wish to travel with us, but will not be performing with us, a.k.a parents :P) who will be paying for themselves. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alaskapella’s mission is to share our love and joy of music with the community and to represent Alaska (and especially the arts community of Southeast Alaska) to the world in the best possible manner.

<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>I'm taking a HUGE risk! </p>
<p>Basically, it's a big gamble on art &amp; love and a belief that Visionary Music for the Heart is important &amp; valued! I've funded everything myself so far through my work as a facilitator and an artist and am proud to be able to remain independent and not have to take out a hefty loan to launch this album!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To be honest, one the biggest challenges in creating and launching this album has been letting go of all the blockages in the way of me actually manifesting the funds required to make this miracle a reality! More specifically, figuring out how to come up with the funds to create a super high quality recording AND a translate this into a spectacular live show with ongoing performances and of course, the large task of creating a successful campaign to support the launch. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When people suggested I do a crowdfunding, I honestly thought I didn't need one, I thought I'd be able to pay for it all myself and maybe do a kick-ass raffle on the night of the concert!  But it took a couple of my closest friends sitting me down and convincing me to a crowd funding campaign to put the call out for HELP when I realised that this was actually a totally awesome idea! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I beloved that people LOVE supporting people!!!  People are GOOD!!! And...</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""> I LOVE PEOPLE!!!!! </span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But, This whole process really scared me. I am the type of person that tries to do everything herself, and all my work with  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/elementalvoicesaustralia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elemental Voices</a> workshops &amp; courses has funded everything this far. I  really think I am blessed to be able to do what I love and pay for my rent, my food, my art and live in a safe and happy environment. I see my privilege in that there are so many people out there in the world in a much worst place, but I really do believe that this art has a purpose and is worth sharing with the world. </p>

</div></div>","Clare Sentience : A bit about meI'm really passionate about meeting my edges, and so I'm putting a call out to the community to help me launch my debut album of soulful, sweet, powerful & beautiful in the spectacular fashion - through a crowd funding project AND a LIVE album launch celebration!I'm a self funded, totally independent singer, songwriter, sound healer and teacher/facilitator of singing & self expression. I love to offer sound healing journeys, cacao ceremonies, singing workshops, courses and retreats, all with a focus on unlocking the voice, empowering visions, opening the heart and creating more freedom in the lives of individuals, in particular those who have experienced trauma, through singing. I have been singing my whole life! It's what I love to do! It's my purpose. I have sung in various choirs, groups & bands around the world over the past 20 years & supported many musicians with their musical projects, tours & albums.I created the vast range of multi genre music for 'Soul Transmissions' in 2014/2015, recorded & produced it with Travis Jekks Taylor (ethnomusicologist) in May/June 2015 and am now 100% ready to launch this labour of love into the world in a BIG WAY on the 24th of September 2016. It's been a long time coming to get my own music birthed into the world, and as a solo artist & musician, I had a lot of work to do to get to this point in the journey but, now it's time to ask for help. What does this mean to me ?This album means the world to me! It's very much a local made project & a labour of love - Recorded, Produced, Mixed, Mastered, Printed AND Launching in my home town of Melbourne!I was born & raised here, although I spent my 20's living in the home of my ancestors - Ireland & the UK, while travelling the world singing & adventuring.It feels very special to create something that really expresses my heart, soul & deep values, that honours my connection to this land, to nature and to my community, that is aligned with my deep core truth, my connection to Spirit and supports local artists & musicians in the process. Why support this project? By supporting this project, contributors will help me fully fund this production, the launch of the album, the printing of CD's and pay local artists for their contributions to the album and to the concert celebration extravaganza on the 24th of September 2016. My ultimate goal is to complete the journey I began in 2014 and launch this album while maintaining my freedom as an independent artist with a passionate drive to use Visionary Music for the Heart as a tool for spreading love, creating change, birthing inspiration, building community and offering celebration as a way of life.  Also, I intend to perform in rural and culturally diverse areas and bring visionary music for he heart out of the city and to a farther reaching community.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi Great-Live-Music-Lovers!</p>
<p>We are Anna.lee (singer/songwriter) &amp; Nock (producer)!</p>
<p>Anna.lee was born in Venice (Italy), she started singing and playing in bands when she was a teenager and started her career in music in a punk band at the age of 18. ;-) She moved to Barcelona (Spain) some years later and became the lead singer of the alternative rock band A Little Boy Lost. After some time, she decided to start her own solo project, with the help and direction of Nock, a producer-composer based in Barcelona who really helped her in shaping her music around her voice and personality!</p>
<p>Nock has had a long career in Barcelona in music production as an independent producer and in big production companies. In these last years he has dedicated himself to promote and help new rising artists and to carry on his solo projects (<a href=""http://www.nockmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nockmusic.com</a>).</p>
<p>In 2016 they finished the first Anna.lee's solo album, Electro Renaissance. You can listen to the entire album online and it's already available for purchase on CdBaby!</p>
<p><strong>In January 2017, after releasing 3 new singles, they have decided: IT'S TIME TO GO LIVE!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>As you will hear, the songs are incredibly elaborated, innovative, they mix the old and the new in a mixture of acoustic &amp; instruments + the magic of special electronics &amp; programming.</strong></p>
<p>In order to play this live for all of you guys, we need some help! </p>
<p><strong>There is nothing better than creating something amazing and then being able to give it as a gift to others!</strong> And that's what we miss right now, we have a wonderful baby and we want to present it to the world! But we need the proper ""stroller"" to carry the baby around :-)</p>
<p><strong>We need YOU, in order to CREATE A WONDERFUL, INNOVATIVE, HYPNOTIZING, ETHNO-ELECTRO-POP-ROCK KICK-ASS GIG!</strong></p>
<p>And then you'll be able to say... I was part of that! I actually made THAT show happen! WOW!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have completely auto-funded the album and the new-singles, but we need extra help to bring it to a FULLY AMAZING LIVE DIMENSION!</p>
<p>In order to experience Anna.lee's Live Tour, we need:</p>
<p>- 3 musicians &amp; a dancer (yes, a dancer!)</p>
<p>- renting the proper venue in Barcelona for the Premiere</p>
<p>- hire a visual artist for projections during the show</p>
<p>- hire a sound technician for the gig</p>
<p>- and, most important, the gear: </p>

<p> </p>
<p>So, we are super-grateful for you contribution to cover the above costs and MAKE IT A-LIVE!</p>
<p>If we do not reach the goal...we will aim to prepare our gig anyway in a much simpler format and in August-September instead of May, but, we know you want to see it at full potential, so make it real with us! Make it spectacular and at the level of the music we are presenting!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We call this project ""<i>Merging Arts</i>"". We live in the Global Village now where technologies and arts are mixing together every day more. We are part of this. We mix arts, cultures, histories, music styles, instruments &amp; machines.</strong></p>
<p>Contributing to our project, you will contribute to bringing on stage a new expanded vision of a live concert, of music genres and art in the Global Village. We want to bring on stage, and sing them out loud, the wonders of all that's been learnt by humanity through history. <strong>We will celebrate the Old and the New, Light and Dark, Femenine and Masculine, and above all, cultures of the world, humanity, nature, technology...!</strong></p>
<p>Help us bringing this message around the world, help us break the ice and make this first amazing gig!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The challenges are many: as you can hear, the music we do is very elaborated and bringing it to a live dimension is not easy. But Nock is really convinced that, with a little of your help, we will manage to create a wonderful gig with Anna.lee singing and three more multi-task musicians.</p>
<p>Wanna bet? :-)</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>If you can contribute in any other way, it would be fantastic! Help us spread the word, share our music, post it in your social media, tell everybody how good it is!</p>

<p>There are millions of great ideas that never get the chance to be considered, let alone be seen, experienced or heard. <strong>A good idea remains a good idea until you act on it</strong>; we're excited to share what we've created with the world – which is precisely the reason for this campaign.</p>

<p>As independent artists, we get very little support from the Department of Arts and Culture. With the help of Concerts SA and generous benefactors, we've managed to tour SA (with 10 sold-out shows) and record  these original compositions.</p>

 </p><p>What about mastering?  Well, let me tell you about that.  A dear friend, and one-time bandmate of mine, runs a successful studio.  He’s much further along in his career, as in three Grammys further along, and he believes very much in me, and the mastering (and one lead vocal and one upright bass track) was a gift.  Mike, you have my eternal gratitude!  You’re my first major contributor!</p><p>I paid the other musicians on this record $150.  It’s not enough, but it’s all I could do at the time.</p><p><i>OK, Raina, we’ve covered $1150 here for recording, but you’re looking for $2000.  What else?</i></p><p>I’m glad you asked!</p><ul>
<li>Printing 100 physical copies of the disc is $225.  </li>
<li>I want to pay the artist who did the mockups of my art for the printer.  I’d love to give him $200 at the very least for his time retouching the cover photo and making the .ai files.  He’s my cousin, but hey, he lives in NYC and I think that would buy him a beer or two, right?  </li>
<li>Printing stickers to send out with the disc is $50.</li>
<li>Website registration, maintenance and plug-ins is running me $200 and year, and it’s been 2 years so far I’ve been working on it.  (And y’all, I had to learn Wordpress and I run my own site.  Uhhhg.)</li>
<li>TuneCore membership and distribution ($50), ASCAP registration and membership ($225), incorporation fees for my publishing company ($130) and official copyright registration ($110) have me at $515 for legality alone.</li>
<li>Initial advertising just to get the word out on social media has been $500.</li>
<li>Label dues (I’m on a grassroots label) over the 4 years this has been incubating - $300.</li>
<li>Final Cut Pro, which I purchased and learned so I can create my own music videos - $300.</li>
<li>Logic Pro X, where I do all of my recording - $200.</li>
<li>My home studio … ooooph … I think I’ve put $10K at least into that over the years.  I recently had to replace my iMac (it was the second, and it died in a freak power surge), and the iMac before that, not to mention my interfaces, effects processors, guitars, amps, pedals, microphones, cables, monitors, soundproofing, my keyboard… it hurts to think about.  </li>
<li>Travel to and from Minneapolis for recording - $200.</li>

the record is This Ship is Sinking which had 97.  NINETY-SEVEN TRACKS.  I arrange full orchestras of synths and vocals.  I record the rhythm guitars, the piano, the background vocals, and the entire sound bed in my home studio.So the $1000?  That was paid to my co-producer, Will Maravelas.  Will and I go way back, to when we were in rock bands playing together at the Warehouse in La Crosse, WI.  Will wanted to help me get the music out, and knew I was paying for 100% out of my own pocket.  It’s not often one gets a friend rate, but I’m eternally grateful.  Will runs 14:59 Studio in Minneapolis, MN, and there we tracked most of the lead vocals, the drums, and the guitar solo on Become My Bones.  He then mixed this beast into aural submission.  Some songs had up to 13 versions (hint: it was the one with 97 tracks)!  I wish I could’ve paid him 5 times what I did.  Maybe I still can, with your help!  What about mastering?  Well, let me tell you about that.  A dear friend, and one-time bandmate of mine, runs a successful studio.  He’s much further along in his career, as in three Grammys further along, and he believes very much in me, and the mastering (and one lead vocal and one upright bass track) was a gift.  Mike, you have my eternal gratitude!  You’re my first major contributor!I paid the other musicians on this record $150.  It’s not enough, but it’s all I could do at the time.OK, Raina, we’ve covered $1150 here for recording, but you’re looking for $2000.  What else?I’m glad you asked!
Printing 100 physical copies of the disc is $225.  
I want to pay the artist who did the mockups of my art for the printer.  I’d love to give him $200 at the very least for his time retouching the cover photo and making the .ai files.  He’s my cousin, but hey, he lives in NYC and I think that would buy him a beer or two, right?  
Printing stickers to send out with the disc is $50.
Website registration, maintenance and plug-ins is running me $200 and year, and it’s been 2 years so far I’ve been working on it.  (And y’all, I had to learn Wordpress and I run my own site.  Uhhhg.)
TuneCore membership and distribution ($50), ASCAP registration and membership ($225), incorporation fees for my publishing company ($130) and official copyright registration ($110) have me at $515 for legality alone.
Initial advertising just to get the word out on social media has been $500.
Label dues (I’m on a grassroots label) over the 4 years this has been incubating - $300.
Final Cut Pro, which I purchased and learned so I can create my own music videos - $300.
Logic Pro X, where I do all of my recording - $200.
My home studio … ooooph … I think I’ve put $10K at least into that over the years.  I recently had to replace my iMac (it was the second, and it died in a freak power surge), and the iMac before that, not to mention my interfaces, effects processors, guitars, amps, pedals, microphones, cables, monitors, soundproofing, my keyboard… it hurts to think about.  
Travel to and from Minneapolis for recording - $200.
Years and years of music lessons - $5000 is a very conservative figure (and THANK YOU, Mom and Dad!!!).
Lastly, I went to college for Recording Technology at Belmont University in Nashville, TN.  We’re not even going to look at that number… No need to cry today!

Seeing the abysmal state that children’s music was mired in, Ian set about doing his best to change all that. He wanted to make REAL music that REAL kids and their families could enjoy together. So, he assembled a super-team of musicians and writers and artists and creators to make this dream of his a reality. With their help, the music and the band and the universe of the Shazzbots were born! Now, with 2 full-length albums, 100’s of live performances and an Emmy-winning TV show under their jumpsuited belts, the past decade has seen the Shazzbots team work their hardest to realize Ian’s original goal... Changing family entertainment for the better.</p><p>To celebrate our 10-year anniversary, and the recording of our 1st new all original record in 5 years, we wanted to pull out all the stops! For our 3rd record, we are putting in the same countless hours in the studio, crafting amazing songs and stories for children of all ages to enjoy, that we have with the past two studio releases: Shazzbots GO! and Blast Off!. We are striving to create a sonic landscape with <i>LIGHTSPEED!</i> that pushes the boundaries of “kids music”. We strongly believe that children enjoy listening to the same breadth of musical stylings that adults do. Happy songs. Sad songs. Rockin’ songs. Funky songs. Slow songs. Kids are more mature in their listening preferences than most newer “kids bands” give them credit for. That's why The Shazzbots have always strived to harken back to the days of Jim Henson and Sesame Street, of Schoolhouse Rock, of Shel Silverstein. All music, poetry and art that still resonates with the adults of today.</p><p>But not only do we once again want to produce the best music for families to enjoy imaginable, we want to release this album in multiple formats, to really help the kiddos get excited about music and the listening experience! Of course we will be releasing <i>LIGHTSPEED!</i> on compact disc (for the cars) and digital (for the iPads) formats, but for the first time, we will also be putting out an exclusive vinyl version of the album! Again, we have seen that there are virtually no kids records being released in this format, and we have to wonder why?? Vinyl records are an important medium in the history of music, that has never been more popular. It’s long been the reigning champ of the format best designed for an immersive music listening experience. Full rich sound and large album art sleeves are why listeners have flocked to vinyl and made it the longest running music format that is still thriving to this day. So, why NOT make a vinyl record for KIDS to enjoy?? We can’t think of reason not to either. </p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU'LL GET</strong></p><p>We have launched this exclusive presale campaign to help us get firm numbers of products that our fans are interested in and to help allay some of the upfront costs of producing an album on multiple formats. As you have seen above, we are already hard at work at Vital Studios crafting the amazing music of <i>LIGHTSPEED!</i>. But the type of packaging and artwork we want to create can get pricey. For the vinyl version of the record, we want to create a super-deluxe gatefold package that is sure to blow the minds of both kids and parents alike! The Shazzbots’ Space Winnebago speeding at you on the front cover and rocketing away on the back will be the same as on the CD version (just way bigger!). But the interior gatefold will feature exclusive art created just for this vinyl release, showing an incredible cross-section of the ship and it’s endless amount of rooms! (Remember, much like Dr. Who’s Tardis, the Shazzbots’ Space Winnebago is waaay bigger inside than out, thanks to that localized worm-hole device that Professor Swiss Vanderburton installed.) Couple all that with an exclusively designed inner sleeve and labels, this album is chock full of not only music but ART too! And as you know, that is one of the hallmarks of the Shazzbots’ brand... Spreading the joys of music, art and creativity to all the children of the cosmos!</p><p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p><p>If you don’t have the funds to get on board now with this exclusive presale, don’t fret! This album in all its forms will be available on our website, at our shows and in all the finer music shops around Columbus, Ohio. But you can still help us raise some of the upfront capital needed to make this record happen even if you can’t contribute financially.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Danielle Hecht is a producer, director, performer and photographer originally from Massachusetts. Her educational background ranges from Music, Media Arts, Art History, Theater Arts, Production, Dance and Cinema in addition to working as a freelance corporate photographer in the New York area. As she takes her first step towards becoming a self produced musical artist, she aims to utilize all components of her creative background to manifest work that is thoughtful, progressive, multidimensional and genuine.  In doing so Danielle acknowledges that she cannot reach her goals alone and only with the help of her collaborators will she have the opportunity to achieve success.  It is of the utmost importance to Danielle that all her collaborators are shown the respect they deserve for the services they provide -- and that means fair monitory compensation. It is a daunting task to take on a leadership role in an industry that so often devalues an artists contribution in a collaborative setting -- thus, as Danielle continues to grow her business, she hopes to create a culture rooted in mutual respect, transparency and equanimity. </p>

<p>The video above is the first music video I ever released, and I hope to make a lot more quality songs and videos in the next few months!</p>
<p>My name is Shiv, I'm 18 years old, and I'm an independent artist currently based in Miami. Just 2 years ago I was sitting in my room listening to my favourite rapper J. Cole, hoping to become as great as he is and making music that positively influences a generation of youth. I never thought I'd have the courage to try anything like that until I stepped in the studio a year ago and recorded my first 5 professional tracks. The song you see in the video above is one of them. Over the past year, I've recorded over 50 tracks in my dorm room in college, and I truly believe that I've reached a stage where I'm ready to create a body of work that will connect with the souls of people and at the same time be enjoyable to fans of hip-hop. </p>
<p>2 months ago I began recording rough mixes to a mini-album that resonates with my views on the world and truths that I've had to face as a teenager growing up in a cruel world. I've never worked harder on lyricism and I know that what I'm creating comes straight from the heart. The movement that I want to create in rap is one that is filled with positivity. I want kids to set aside their problems and distance themselves from negative energy so that they can chase their dreams. I've been through the lowest of lows with my family and I know what it feels like to set yourself on a downwards spiral that is difficult to get out of. The tracks in this album delve deep into the human consciousness and society, and really explore the many problems that the youth of my generation encounter on a daily basis. It's an eye-opening piece of work.</p>
<p>The budget for this project stems from the fact that I've assembled a talented team that will help me take this project to the next level. From my producer, to studio-time, to my videographer, to my editor, to my marketing team; everybody needs to be paid for their hard-work in helping this project reach the next level. I need this album to work because it's been my dream for a long time now. I've always wanted to create a project that has high-quality production and videos that tell stories. For this to happen, I need everyone in my team to be compensated so that we all can enjoy the fruits of this album.</p>
<p>I'm an independent artist so I need YOU to be my record label. Your support will not only help me achieve my dreams but also help me captivate the attention of the youth with the messages in my music. I will be creating a piece of art with my music and the videos that come along with them. </p>

<h3>Aloha Musical Compadres! </h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is David Courtenay.  I'm a singer, composer and performer who lives to brighten the world with music and empower all people through the gift of song and uplifting lyrics. I've known this was my calling ever since I was four-years-old and first performed in front of a big audience at a talent show. By the end of my song, I had the whole crowd up on their feet, hootin' and hollering.  When I felt the joy and enthusiasm the music brought out of me, and the whole room full of people, I knew this was my path.  At the age of 17, I tested out of high school, formed a band and have been making music and playing professionally ever since. My music has taken me on tours up the West Coast, all over the Midwest and as far east as Pittsburgh, New York, Boston, and Miami. I've released four albums of original music along the way and have had the pleasure of making six music videos. The awakening power of music is the gift I wish to give the world  - and I live to share it in every possible way!</p>
<p>I recently took the next big step in my music career and hired a top-level producer (Jesse Siebenberg) to assist me in recording ten new songs (to be release as two, back-to-back ""EP's""). We just recorded the foundational tracks of each song at the world-class, Grammy-award-winning <i>Brotheryn Studios</i>. Jesse brought in his all-star team of pro studio musicians to play on the record, and they have created the stellar sound and high-caliber production I've always dreamed of for my music. To get this project going, I invested all of my music savings into the first phase of recording, and now I need your assistance in funding the completion of the songs. Once the songs are mixed, mastered and ready for global distribution, the next step is to promote and market them through every possible medium: online social media marketing, new music videos, college and internet radio campaigns and the launching of an extensive U.S. tour. Reaching the right audience requires having the capital to get the music out there, and this is where I greatly need your help!</p>

<p>Hello, we are Maxwell Dulaney and Orlando Cela.  After collaborating for almost a decade writing, performing, and teaching, we feel the need to further encourage the development of truly innovative new music.  There are many composers out there not only writing music, but pushing the boundaries of instruments, perceptions, and structures, and we want to encourage an exchange of these ideas at a national level. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For our first concert, we are bringing cello virtuoso and song-writer Meaghan Burke from New York City, as well as bringing Maxwell from New Orleans.  Both are artists who are actively experimenting with very innovative ways to use instruments and musical forms. Bringing them together is just the first step in this idea and arts exchange - Meaghan will be performing a solo cello work by Maxwell.  Local composer Derek Hurst is also working with Orlando on a new piece for flute, also to be heard at the concert.  Finally, a selection of other works by other cutting edge composers will complete the program. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We also encourage the dialogue about what makes something new, and we expect you, the audience, to actively give us your input in what you hear, feel, or think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For our first event, we need a mere $1500.00. This amount will go towards renting the space and equipment, paying the players, honoraria for the composers, and administrative costs. Any surplus will be directed towards the next event, which is planned for January 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With just this little amount, we can produce a very necessary laboratory style experience for other performers and composers to learn, experiment, and create.  We have already successfully done exchanges like this in places as far as Ningbo, China and a few cities in the USA, using Maxwell’s music to train college students - and even high-schoolers! - in the production of some of the newest extended techniques for classical, and sometimes, folk instruments.</p>
<p>

Bringing them together is just the first step in this idea and arts exchange - Meaghan will be performing a solo cello work by Maxwell.  Local composer Derek Hurst is also working with Orlando on a new piece for flute, also to be heard at the concert.  Finally, a selection of other works by other cutting edge composers will complete the program. 

We also encourage the dialogue about what makes something new, and we expect you, the audience, to actively give us your input in what you hear, feel, or think.

For our first event, we need a mere $1500.00. This amount will go towards renting the space and equipment, paying the players, honoraria for the composers, and administrative costs. Any surplus will be directed towards the next event, which is planned for January 2016.

With just this little amount, we can produce a very necessary laboratory style experience for other performers and composers to learn, experiment, and create.  We have already successfully done exchanges like this in places as far as Ningbo, China and a few cities in the USA, using Maxwell’s music to train college students - and even high-schoolers! - in the production of some of the newest extended techniques for classical, and sometimes, folk instruments.

Thanks for helping in any way you can.  No matter how little you give, it will help us tremendously to reach our goal.  Also, share the project with your friends so that they may contribute.We hope see you at HazMat!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Beyond
Imagination is a Swedish rock band whose music has it’s roots in
the 70’s and 80’s American West Coast rock. Influences like Toto,
Jay Graydon, Chicago and Al Jarreau has left it’s traces in the
musics sound. In 2014 the band released their EP »Change The Way«, where the title track won <b>The February 2016 Akademia Music Award</b> for <i>Best Pop/Rock Song</i> – now they want to record their first full length album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
To record a
full length album takes great effort. Everything from writing the
songs to rehearsing them with the band, to recording, mixing and
promoting the music - is an extensive and costly process. Now, all the music
is already written and soon to be well rehearsed, but the recording session
lies ahead. It will go down in august this year and that's
where you come into the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
With your
contribution we will reach the limit for our budget and make this
project a dream come true for everyone involved. Your contributions
will cover expenses for recording, mixing, mastering, album cover art AND – <b>best of all</b> – <i>help us get a legendary American session veteran</i><i> to make a guest appearance as a soloist for
one of our songs!</i></p>
<p>
</p><p>
We've put
aside <b>3250$</b> of our own savings for this project so far, now we need to
raise an estimate of <b>5000$</b> to make it all the way. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">No amount is too
small so don't be late with your gift and grab your reward.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
If we don't
reach our full goal here on Indigogo, don't worry – the recording
is going down anyway and the money will be spared until we reach our
budget goal. Though there will be a delay of our release off course!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
This record is
a unique collaboration among enthusiastic up and coming Swedish
musicians and a true American session veteran. We've prepared this recording for over 3 years now - writing numerous songs, played live gigs and rehearsing the music to a minimum. Our CD will
deliver great quality musicianship with well written songs and
transmit the beloved West Coast genre for new generations to come. It
doesn't matter if you're already a West Coast fan or a uninitiated
listener of the genre – we strongly believe you'll enjoy it.</p><p>Please

<p><strong>“I WILL REMEMBER MY DREAMS AND FIGHT FOR THEM.”</strong></p>
<p>It was a packed auditorium on that spring night at my high school. The whole community had turned out to support the high school band’s “Spring Fling” concert. My band director had asked me to perform two songs, <i>Hard Hearted Hannah</i> (<i>The Vamp of Savannah)</i> and <i>Sweet Georgia Brown</i>. We’d come to the place in the concert where it was my turn. Standing behind the microphone, looking up at three hundred plus people, I put everything I had into those two songs. The audience rewarded me with a standing ovation. At seventeen, at that moment, I realized what I was destined to do in my life: to sing, to entertain, and to create music. Why am I telling you this story? I am telling you this story, because the dreams of a seventeen year old girl continue to burn in my heart. Music is my dream, my passion, my heart, my soul, my craft, and my profession. I am making this album because I still believe in my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>I am asking you to partner with me to make an exceptional album. The cost of writing, recording, mixing, mastering, manufacturing, promoting, and releasing an album, in this day and age, can add up. I am an independent artist. I don’t have the backing of a record company. I believe I have something far better. I have you in my corner. Because I believe in me, I have already invested my own money in the writing, recording, producing, mixing, and mastering of this album. I would not ask you to do for me what I am not willing to do for myself.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I was in Nashville, TN June 13- June 17. Under the leadership of executive producer, Gina Hughes (The Galaxie Agency), I recorded 12 songs. At the musical helm, guiding my ship was Grammy winning producer, Tom Hambridge. I co-wrote nine of the twelve songs with Tom and his writing partner, Richard Fleming. Tom assembled a lineup of world class musicians to perform on these songs: Tom Hambridge – drums, Reese Wynans – keyboards, Michael Rhodes – bass, Rob McNelley – guitar, Pat Buchanan – guitar. I can’t wait for you to hear this record! As Tom said, “It’s gonna be epic!”</p>
<p>The recording of this album has been completed largely in part to the generous donations of two “angels”. I still have expenses to conquer. Some of those expenses include, but are not limited to: publicity, graphic design, photography, advertising, manufacturing and replication of the album, legal fees (copyrighting, song licensing, contracts), office supplies (postage, packaging, hard copy promo), and touring to support the album.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Nicole Saphos. I grew up in the LA area, studied jazz at Temple University, and subsequently settled in Washington, D.C. Since moving to D.C in 2012, I’ve been consistently working as a freelance musician in a variety of musical contexts. Over the past few years, I’ve been performing with my own band more regularly, as well as composing and playing my original music. The music I've recorded for <i>Tiptoe</i> is the result of this journey and my collaboration with the talented musicians I’ve met along the way.</p>
<p>It is no secret that there are financial challenges associated with a career in music, which leads me to why I’m reaching out to you today. At this point, I have invested countless hours of planning, rehearsal, and studio time to complete the album, and while I’m thrilled with the end result, there are still many more costs to come.

"" Well, this project is not only a performance project. More importantly, it is a community project with education and love! What We Do in Taiwan:
We will go to several elementary schools in Taiwan, and work with kids through free workshops and interactive lecture recitals. The purpose of this is to connect kids and classical music without distance. Through the activities, the kids will learn the appreciation for music, art and beauty! The children will also learn about classical music, instruments and what do musicians do?
There will be free concerts in different cities (Taichung City and Kaohsiung City.) We would like to spread classical music to the public by giving free concerts and encourage more people to join the world of classical music.

<h3>Meet Care:</h3>
<p><strong>Hey there!</strong> My name is Carolyn Bonini, you can call me <i>Care</i>. I am 22 years old, a college student, youngest of 6 in the Bonini clan, a resident of Bridgeport, CT, and a musician. I sing, play piano, guitar, ukulele, and most importantly, I write my own music. I've played at small gigs, with other bands, and at many many talent shows. I'm ready to take on a bigger stage.</p>
<p><strong>Being famous</strong> is my dream come true. For those of you that know me, you know that I'm not going to be famous for the sake of fame and fortune. I'm on this planet to give back and put out music that is authentic and makes a difference in people's lives. I'm not going to stop until I make it on top, and I can't do it without the support of my community. The world needs trustworthy, influential people now more than ever. While performing, I perform music that is real and authentic. People who hear my music leave feeling moved, touched, and inspired. Now I'm ready to take this to a bigger crowd. </p>

<p><strong>What I'm gonna do </strong>when I'm famous, is set up community centers in communities all around the world. These centers are places where kids and teens can express themselves through the arts. The centers will offer affordable music lessons, art classes, theater classes, as well as opportunities to advance in media arts. There will be mentors on hand at all times: people there specifically for the children to be heard and listened to. Everyone deserves the opportunity to go after their dreams. </p>
<p><strong>Your support </strong>means the world to me. I've never been the type of person to ask for help, but I realize that I can't make this dream come true without you. Your love and belief in what I can do means everything to me, and I'll never ever forget the contribution that you have made.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div><div>
<p>As a child, I always wanted to make it big . Around the age of 10, I made a dream book, and even today I still remember drawing myself on stage in front of a massive crowd. I always knew that I could do it, but I never knew when or how. It wasn't until this year that I realized what has been holding me back all this time. What has gotten in the way is that I've been trying to do this alone. I'm ready to let other people help me with this dream. </p>
<p>This dream isn't just about me. It's about me becoming the type of person that can give back to the whole world. There is a lot to do on this planet. There are plenty of other children and adults who want to be heard and have something really important to say, but they just don't have the spotlight. My mission and commitment in life is that everyone has a voice, and everyone is free. </p>
<p>Four years ago I did another Indiegogo campaign to get to Europe, and out of the support of my community I was able to have the most rewarding and adventurous year and a half abroad, and I'm so grateful to everyone who supported me. I have faith in my community and myself that this is going to be just as successful. Even if this campaign doesn't get me famous, I'm going to use this momentum to continue to share my music and live my life impacting the lives of other people, especially musicians and artists. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's at Stake</h3>
<p>I realize that the path to fame isn't easy, and I can only assume that it's going to be harder than I could have imagined. People don't just become famous overnight. And then there are the celebrities that become depressed in the spot light and it becomes obvious that being famous takes an extreme toll on people and can be very stressful. Plus, there are millions of musicians putting themselves out there and reaching for the same dream as me! </p>
<p>Believe me, I know <i>all </i>of this, and I still have faith. I am a strong believer in the universe, and I know that everything will be ok. I have an amazing community that will be with me through everything. I believe that anything truly is possible, so why can't I get famous?! Let's do this people!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Run The Willow formed as a band in the summer of 2014 in the small town of Gettysburg, PA. Our sound has evolved over the past few years from singer/songwriter to eclectic-folk-rock-goodness (thats our preferred genre title) and we are now a six piece band composed of: Vince Bruinsma (songwriter/vocals/guitar); Bekah Foster (vocals/drums); Chris Hartlaub (banjo); Aaron Susek (accordion); Taylor Greenholt (bass/violin); Ben Muller (viola).</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>""A Living Dichotomy"" is our first full length album as a band. It tells the story of developing a home and explores the beautiful struggle of allowing roots to grow into a community. It is a collection of songs that have been written from a deeply personal space but can resonate with anyone who has experienced the joy/pain/beauty of love, not as a romantic relationship, but as a community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have already started the recording process for these songs, but we need to raise a little bit more funding to complete the album. For the sake of transparency, here are the bare minimum costs associated with completing the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording/Mixing $2500</li>
<li>Mastering $500</li>
<li>Printing of CD/Album $1200</li>
</ul>
<p>So the total cost of the project is $4200. Using funds from our gigs, we have already paid $1400 of the recording costs, which leaves us with another $2800 to raise. The funds from your contribution will be directly applied to the costs shown above. We are also holding a benefit concert on October 20th at Waldo's and Company in Gettysburg, PA. The funds from this show will also go directly towards this project. </p>
<p>If we happen to raise more than our goal, we would love to invest in some extra little tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying a local artist to design our album art - $250 over goal</li>
<li>Hiring a cello player to add parts to the album - $500 over goal</li>
<li>12"" Vinyl Pressing of Album -$1500 over goal</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>The first way that you can help us is by giving us your money (duh), but actually you aren't just giving it away! By selecting any one of the products on the side, you will get a copy of the album once we have completed it (estimated February 2018). Consider it an investment in the future pleasure of your eardrums. </p>
<p>Second, you can come to our fundraising show on October 20th at Waldo's and Company in Gettysburg. </p>
<p>Third, you can share this project with as many people as you possibly can - social media, door-to-door, yelling at people out of your car window - these are all great ways to get the word out. </p>
<p>We are sincerely grateful to you for your support and we would love for you to get involved with this project. Thank you!!</p>

In addition, it can still be heard on hundreds of analog, satellite and cable radio stations nationally and internationally. </p><p>CD CAMPAIGN PROJECT ...</p><p>‘Emerging Slowly’ is a CD that will combine acoustic piano, synthesizers, traditional and world flutes.  The CD will once again cross the genres of new age, classical, jazz, and world music making it universally appealing to many tasted.  The concept of this CD focuses on the mythological symbol of our namesake - the phoenix bird -  dying and regenerating itself over and over. Despite challenges and difficulties of this life, the phoenix always rises again … sometimes quickly and dramatically and sometimes emerging slowly.</p><p>This next CD will cost $8,500 for recording, mixing, manufacturing, and promotion..

The beauty of the Native American Flute is that anyone can play!  A sound is produced by blowing into the end (no embouchure needed).  It is based on a pentatonic scale, so any combination of notes creates a lovely sound!  These flutes are great additions for wind players who want to widen their color palates and they are equally great for folks who have never played a musical instrument before. All flutes are made by a high-quality Native American flute maker.</p><p>All purchases of flutes will include a workshop. This will be a one-and-a-half hour class where you will learn how to play the Native American Flute. Specific skills taught include how to use air support for great tone, vibrato to help vary it, articulation variations, different scales,  basic improvisation, and rhythmic patterns to play with drums. The workshops will conclude with a performance with Phoenix Rising. Workshops will take place in Walnut Creek and in San Francisco. Dates and times TBA. If you are not in the Bay Area, we will include a 20-minute Skype lesson with every flute purchase. </p><p>All products (except the Emerging Slowly CD) will be delivered before the Holiday Season 2015 … excellent gift choices!  And by contributing to the campaign you are giving us at the wonderful present of being able to continue sharing our creations.  </p><p>Many of these flutes has been demonstrated in the video.

In addition, it can still be heard on hundreds of analog, satellite and cable radio stations nationally and internationally. CD CAMPAIGN PROJECT ...‘Emerging Slowly’ is a CD that will combine acoustic piano, synthesizers, traditional and world flutes.  The CD will once again cross the genres of new age, classical, jazz, and world music making it universally appealing to many tasted.  The concept of this CD focuses on the mythological symbol of our namesake - the phoenix bird -  dying and regenerating itself over and over. Despite challenges and difficulties of this life, the phoenix always rises again … sometimes quickly and dramatically and sometimes emerging slowly.This next CD will cost $8,500 for recording, mixing, manufacturing, and promotion.. We appreciate all levels of contribution and would love your support!Breakdown on costs for 'Emerging Slowly':$300 Artwork for CD$300 Graphic design for CD $1,600 Recording of CD (20 hours @ $80 an hour)$2,000 Mixing and  mastering$3,000 Distribution and promotion$1300 Manufacturing of 1000 CDsTotal $8,500DETAILS ON PERKS ...There are many unique perks for this campaign including a variety of Native American Flutes, Luxurious Flute Bags, Private Lessons, Workshops, CD packages, and House Concerts. The beauty of the Native American Flute is that anyone can play!  A sound is produced by blowing into the end (no embouchure needed).  It is based on a pentatonic scale, so any combination of notes creates a lovely sound!  These flutes are great additions for wind players who want to widen their color palates and they are equally great for folks who have never played a musical instrument before. All flutes are made by a high-quality Native American flute maker.All purchases of flutes will include a workshop. This will be a one-and-a-half hour class where you will learn how to play the Native American Flute. Specific skills taught include how to use air support for great tone, vibrato to help vary it, articulation variations, different scales,  basic improvisation, and rhythmic patterns to play with drums. The workshops will conclude with a performance with Phoenix Rising. Workshops will take place in Walnut Creek and in San Francisco. Dates and times TBA. If you are not in the Bay Area, we will include a 20-minute Skype lesson with every flute purchase. All products (except the Emerging Slowly CD) will be delivered before the Holiday Season 2015 … excellent gift choices!  And by contributing to the campaign you are giving us at the wonderful present of being able to continue sharing our creations.  Many of these flutes has been demonstrated in the video. If you would like to quickly hear a specific flute, the specific times are listed below.  We are happy to answer any question on these flutes, so please feel free to contact us.

that aren’t typically completed by two women in a profession that men dominate.<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p></p>We are ideally located off I-95 so convenience is on our
side.  And every BarnBurner event will be
based on items and services that are convenient to our ticket buyers.  Let’s start with purchasing tickets.  Customers will have the opportunity to

<p><b>What We Need From You</b></p>
<p>There are a lot of people who do not understand the entire
process of throwing a concert and how much work and costs are included.  Most of you probably think the
most difficult part is booking a band and lining up the dates they’re available
with the dates the venue is available.  Wrong!!  A decent sized concert costs $30,000-$50,000,
on average.  And some of those costs that
go un-noticed are advertisements like flyers, posters, radio and TV ads,
catering and Green Room requirements for the bands when they’re backstage, employee
salaries, purchasing your ticket sales website and many other small tasks that
tend to add up.  Sometimes, you have to
buy items to stock the artist’s buses if they’re on tour because they can’t
stop at WalMart to pick those things up due to their strict schedule.  <br/></p><p>As a promoter, you’re number one goal is to
sell a show out and you have to go to great lengths in order to accomplish
that.  If you’ve signed up to promote a
show and you don’t take the time to do these small, but very important tasks,
why promote at all?  That’s one major
mistake we’ve witnessed other promoters make in this town.  If you’re not going to promote to the best of
your ability, you’re doing yourself, the artist and most importantly, your
business, a huge disservice.  We didn’t
create this business to bullshit, we created this business to <i>promote</i> and <i>prove</i>
to others that <b>IT CAN BE DONE</b> in a small town.</p>
<p>We’re asking for a total of $100,000.  That gives us enough money to book, promote
and produce at least two concerts.  It also
gives us a little extra cash to experiment with things like advertising in
additional areas to figure out which communities purchase more tickets and for
what type of shows so that we can lay out a successful plan for our future
endeavors.  And we’re not just laying out
a plan for ourselves; we’re going to help other promoters as well.<br/></p><p>When you Google concert statistics in Roanoke
Rapids, NC, you come up with nothing.  You can't even find statistics in surrounding areas.  So
we’re going to change that.  Not only will our business put this area on the map, we’re in the
process of creating a website just for promoters so they’ll be able to easily
organize shows once they’re booked.  This
website will include specific venue and production company info as well as
calendars with notifications to keep them on track.  Don’t let this throw you off because in order
to start a website, it costs around $60 a month.  We don’t have a lot of cash to throw into
this thing but we’re going to slowly build it up.  Once we get our first two shows under our
belt, we will be able to stand on our own two feet.  We’re two girls packed full of a million
ideas.  We just don’t have the funds to
act on them, at the moment.</p><p>If you’re interested in investing or just curious, shoot us an e-mail
and we’ll be happy to send you a detailed list of charges and costs.  We’ll also include some of the
quotes we’ve received along the way and explain our plan further.  We
have nothing to hide.<br/></p>
<p>In 2014, LiveNation made a whopping 4.73 BILLION DOLLARS in
concert revenue.  Out of those Billions
of dollars, $1,557,250 was earned in ticketing revenue.  Talk about goals!!  Are we insane for trying to pursue something
that big?  Probably so!  But what type of
business owner are you if you don’t set extreme goals?  We’re starting in our hometown to help
revive this place but we’re not stopping there. 
We’re going to excel in areas other female promoters haven’t and expand in no time.  We’re determined and it will happen, no
matter what.</p>

<p>Sugarplum Studio is the sugar baby of South Jersey pastry chef Sharon O’Connor Spatucci. Sharon has spent the past fifteen years covered in flour and sugar and is rarely seen without clogs on her feet, food dye on her hands, and her hair in a bun. She has lovingly spent countless hours transforming simple ingredients into edible masterpieces to the delight of her family, friends, and anyone else who’s tasted her works of art. </p>
<p>Although working professionally as a pastry chef has been great over the years, it doesn’t quite match the joy Sharon experiences when she is able to see her own creations through other people’s eyes. Hearing a child exclaim, “I love it!” or a bride express “The cake was exactly as I envisioned!” provides happiness that only a pastry chef would understand.  </p>
<p>Cake decorating has become an attainable hobby for the home baker, so Sharon is often asked for advice and assistance. One of the best ways Sharon has been able to expand upon her career skills is through teaching. She has conducted many workshops, parties, and private instruction sessions – from basic decorating for cakes and cookies, to building gingerbread houses, to more advanced techniques using rolled fondant and gum paste. Cake decorating can be a daunting activity for beginners to take on, but Sharon has always reassured her students that their skills will come with practice. Yet when it comes to the creative element, she teaches that there is no right or wrong in art – even when the medium is buttercream. </p>
<p>With that in mind, Sharon has dreamed of a place where both children and adults could go to learn and have fun. The idea of Sugarplum Studio was born.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433284636/wfo75t8ox0fucowno7q7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What is Sugarplum Studio?</b></p>
<p>Sugarplum Studio will be an edible art studio where both children and adults can visit to custom decorate cakes, cupcakes, and cookies and express their creativity in edible form. You’ve seen “paint your own pottery” and “create your own canvas” – why not “decorate your own cake”?  Sugarplum Studio will provide all of the materials, tools, and step-by-step instructions from professional pastry chefs. You bring your creativity, take home your masterpiece, and leave the mess behind!</p>
<p>The Studio will be able to host parties, play dates, ladies nights out, scout troops, class trips – any occasion where a fun activity is in order.  </p>
<p>No party, no problem! The Studio will have Open Studio hours where you can come in and complete a themed, self-guided, edible decorating project. It’s the perfect diversion for kids, bored teenagers, or moms who just need to get out of the house for an hour. Plus, you get to eat your art!</p>
<p>Additionally, Sugarplum Studio will offer the custom-designed cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and desserts that Sharon has become known for. The facility will also have a pastry case where delicious gourmet cakes and desserts will be available for purchase.</p><br/>
<p><b>Where do you come in?</b></p>
<p>Well, if Sharon had a dollar for <i>every single time</i> someone told her that she should have her own place to do this, there would be absolutely no need for a crowdfunding campaign! But unfortunately, New Jersey does not have a Cottage Food Law, so a studio like this requires a commercial kitchen to even get started. Commercial kitchens require lots of equipment, lots of insurance, and lots of expenses. For a pastry chef who just wants to spread a little sugar love, that’s a lot to take on. A little help from you would bring Sugarplum Studio to life. </p>
<p>Sharon has incorporated as an LLC, found the perfect space for the studio, and is working to raise the <i>dough</i> to make this happen. For the majority of the expenses, Sharon will secure a small business loan. Since it can be difficult for startups to borrow funding capital when they have no equity (especially in the food service industry), Sharon needs to raise some capital to get in the door first. Every single dollar of your donation will go toward getting Sugarplum Studio started with licenses, permits, inspections, signage, equipment, and additional expenses.  </p><p><br/></p><p><b>How much money are we talking about?</b></p><p>Sharon is estimating that she'll need $65,000 to open Sugarplum Studio. This includes leasing the space, completing renovations to get it up to health department codes, purchasing a commercial mixer, commercial oven, and additional equipment necessary to get started. Food service operations are all or nothing propositions and she can't open without being fully funded. Most SBA micro loans will lend up to $50,000 and require some kind of collateral. By raising $25,000, Sharon will be in a position to secure other financing options beyond the SBA. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What’s in it for you?</b></p>
<p>Okay, Sharon understands that sometimes “thank you” doesn’t quite suffice. With that in mind, Sugarplum Studio is offering various incentives for different levels of contribution.

Sugarplum Studio is the sugar baby of South Jersey pastry chef Sharon O’Connor Spatucci. Sharon has spent the past fifteen years covered in flour and sugar and is rarely seen without clogs on her feet, food dye on her hands, and her hair in a bun. She has lovingly spent countless hours transforming simple ingredients into edible masterpieces to the delight of her family, friends, and anyone else who’s tasted her works of art. 
Although working professionally as a pastry chef has been great over the years, it doesn’t quite match the joy Sharon experiences when she is able to see her own creations through other people’s eyes. Hearing a child exclaim, “I love it!” or a bride express “The cake was exactly as I envisioned!” provides happiness that only a pastry chef would understand.  
Cake decorating has become an attainable hobby for the home baker, so Sharon is often asked for advice and assistance. One of the best ways Sharon has been able to expand upon her career skills is through teaching. She has conducted many workshops, parties, and private instruction sessions – from basic decorating for cakes and cookies, to building gingerbread houses, to more advanced techniques using rolled fondant and gum paste. Cake decorating can be a daunting activity for beginners to take on, but Sharon has always reassured her students that their skills will come with practice. Yet when it comes to the creative element, she teaches that there is no right or wrong in art – even when the medium is buttercream. 
With that in mind, Sharon has dreamed of a place where both children and adults could go to learn and have fun. The idea of Sugarplum Studio was born.What is Sugarplum Studio?
Sugarplum Studio will be an edible art studio where both children and adults can visit to custom decorate cakes, cupcakes, and cookies and express their creativity in edible form. You’ve seen “paint your own pottery” and “create your own canvas” – why not “decorate your own cake”?  Sugarplum Studio will provide all of the materials, tools, and step-by-step instructions from professional pastry chefs. You bring your creativity, take home your masterpiece, and leave the mess behind!
The Studio will be able to host parties, play dates, ladies nights out, scout troops, class trips – any occasion where a fun activity is in order.  
No party, no problem! The Studio will have Open Studio hours where you can come in and complete a themed, self-guided, edible decorating project. It’s the perfect diversion for kids, bored teenagers, or moms who just need to get out of the house for an hour. Plus, you get to eat your art!
Additionally, Sugarplum Studio will offer the custom-designed cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and desserts that Sharon has become known for. The facility will also have a pastry case where delicious gourmet cakes and desserts will be available for purchase.
Where do you come in?
Well, if Sharon had a dollar for every single time someone told her that she should have her own place to do this, there would be absolutely no need for a crowdfunding campaign! But unfortunately, New Jersey does not have a Cottage Food Law, so a studio like this requires a commercial kitchen to even get started. Commercial kitchens require lots of equipment, lots of insurance, and lots of expenses. For a pastry chef who just wants to spread a little sugar love, that’s a lot to take on. A little help from you would bring Sugarplum Studio to life. 
Sharon has incorporated as an LLC, found the perfect space for the studio, and is working to raise the dough to make this happen. For the majority of the expenses, Sharon will secure a small business loan. Since it can be difficult for startups to borrow funding capital when they have no equity (especially in the food service industry), Sharon needs to raise some capital to get in the door first. Every single dollar of your donation will go toward getting Sugarplum Studio started with licenses, permits, inspections, signage, equipment, and additional expenses.  How much money are we talking about?Sharon is estimating that she'll need $65,000 to open Sugarplum Studio. This includes leasing the space, completing renovations to get it up to health department codes, purchasing a commercial mixer, commercial oven, and additional equipment necessary to get started. Food service operations are all or nothing propositions and she can't open without being fully funded. Most SBA micro loans will lend up to $50,000 and require some kind of collateral. By raising $25,000, Sharon will be in a position to secure other financing options beyond the SBA. 
What’s in it for you?
Okay, Sharon understands that sometimes “thank you” doesn’t quite suffice. With that in mind, Sugarplum Studio is offering various incentives for different levels of contribution.

Palestine Youth Orchestra (PYO) was created in 2004 by the Edward Said National
Conservatory of Music (ESNCM) with the vision of bringing together 80 young
Palestinian musicians aged 13 to 26, from around the world in a high-quality
orchestral ensemble.  The PYO aims to foster and strengthen the rich cultural and artistic diversity of the Palestinian people, whether living in Palestine or in the Diaspora, and to promote the recognition and to enhance the awareness of that diversity both at national and international level. Over the past 10 years, the PYO performed in Palestine, Germany, Jordan, Syria, Bahrain, Lebanon, Greece and Italy.  </p>The exchange programs and partnerships which the ESNCM has established with institutions in other countries, allow a number of young foreign musicians to join the tours of the Orchestra. Sharing their respective cultural richness often leads to long-lasting friendships amongst members of the orchestra. Such was the case in the 2012 PYO tour of Italy which saw the participation of 20 musicians from the conservatoires of Rome and Genoa. <div>

</div></div>","HI! We are Young Sullivan! Our names are Brandon Young and Stephen Sullivan. We are a hard working, driven, and dedicated country music Duo out of the Heart of Dixie... Weaver, Alabama.



We have been pushing our brand and making a name for ourselves for the past 4 years. We have recently just this past year written and recorded enough songs to come out with an EP so we can spread the love of music to the far reaches of the globe. We have had some help along the way... but help is needed still.

We have already invested our funds into the final production. The Music is recorded, but it has not been mastered. And the costs associated with the production and studio have been more than we could have ever expected... and it has depleted a majority of our resources.
So... We are asking for your help!
You can be a part of reaching a dream that will propel us forward in ways just four short years ago seemed completely out of reach, simply by helping out wherever you can.
We Have a Plan...
We want to get our album into as many hands as possible so... we have a publicity team that is ready to take this on and get our music to the masses. All that's really left to do is get the promotional material (t-shirts, fliers, and other promotional items) and to actually press the CD's. What We Need... What You Get!
 Lets break it down for you...
We are looking to raise $2500.00. This is the bare minimum we need. If we don't make this goal, we will still go ahead with production of the CD's but will will have to hold off on distribution. 
In order to achieve this goal, we've designed a few ""perks"" that should be very appealing to you. :)
for instance... How would you like a nice Home-Cooked meal prepared by Brandon Young and Stephen Sullivan right in your own home? sound inciting! Oh yeah.
Check out the rest of the on the right of the screen -------------------------------------->
The goal funds will be used to help us purchase the CD's and all promotional material needed to really push this Album and give it exposure, and to producing the Best, Most high quality product we can deliver. We ALSO hope to have enough to make a Music Video of one of the songs on the album if there is enough!
Any funds that we receive over our original goal will go into making the release the best that we can, to get it the exposure that it deserves, and to making sure that we can give you the best experience possible.
   The Impact you can make is unfathomable... Every dollar that is raised is another dollar towards a dream that we have been working on for the past 4 years. There have been ups and downs. The has been heartache and job loss, sleeping in cars and spending the night on the road, broken strings, equipment purchases... you get the idea.
This is a chance for you to make as big a difference as we hope we will make with our music. We whole-heartedly believe in this and know we have the drive and the ability to get this out to everyone and accomplish great things! 

You will have had a hand in all of that!


    Other Ways You Can Help
 Just because you may be a starving musician like us, that doesn't mean you can't help. There are many other ways!
Please share this campaign with everyone you know. Tweet it on the Twittersphere! Facebook it to all your friends! If your a band friend with us, post it on your band page (cause we would do the same for you! That's a promise!)
Simply just being here for us in our time of need is helpful in so many ways!
Thank you in advance for your time, your hard earned dollars, your dedication and most of all, for your belief in us! It means the world to us that we have so many friends and family that are willing to invest into this band as much as we have!

<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>We aim to raise £3,000 to develop our artists mentoring and development program for our 3 recently signed artists. This will go towards:</p>
<p>- Individual artist development plans: 20 hours per artist for things like vocal training, creative writing, brand identity, stage presence and confidence building.</p>
<p>- Recording and releasing an E.P for our 3 signed artists</p>
<p>We have been seriously lucky to work with our friends across the city and extended networks nationally and internationally which have enabled us to offer some really unique perks for this campaign. </p>

<h3>Why we do it</h3>
<p>Empowering young women through music and industry opportunities means that we are able to establish a level playing ground for a more gender equal industry. </p>
<p>By normalising and seeing women in historically male dominant roles we can encourage and inspire the next generation to get into these roles. <br/></p>

<b>The Passion</b><br/>The St Mark is one of four biblical Passions that Bach is known to have composed, of which only two survive in their complete form: St Matthew and St John. It is a ‘parody’ work: owing to time pressures, Bach compiled most of it from music he had already composed for other purposes, a common practice at a time when new music was composed on a weekly basis and was not expected to be kept for posterity.  It was written for Easter 1731 and first performed on Good Friday.                                                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456269253/brbugfrylwmjj2uhrlp8.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 234.392px; height: 315px;""/>
</div><div>Fortunately, we know what that music was, and it is music of quality; remarkably however it shines even brighter in the context of the Passion, as though Bach had known all along that this work was destined for higher purposes. All the existing music can quite easily be matched up with Picander's libretto (which survives in its entirety). But that leaves the recitatives, some arias and the turba choruses without a note.</div><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">The ambition</b><br/>
</div><div>
<p>This is an enormously ambitious project, bringing this lost masterpiece back to life on the anniversary of its first performance, Good Friday.</p>
<p>With the help of contributions from you and other music lovers, we can help Bach’s lost Passion to take its rightful place in the canon of great sacred choral works.<br/>We want to publish the complete reconstruction, so that other groups can perform the work in the future. The original score will be lodged in the archives of the RWCMD along with Andrew Wilson-Dickson’s working notes, and a recording will be made, providing the fullest possible resource for future generations of Bach enthusiasts.</p>
<b>The reconstruction</b><br/>There have been a number of previous reconstructions, some of them drawing on the music of Bach's near contemporaries, others simply omitting some of the music. None of these present an ‘authentic’ experience of the original performance, and that is our aim, with music newly composed in the style of the great master filling in all the gaps. As both a composer and early music specialist, Andrew Wilson-Dickson is ideally suited to this task. He says, ""I imagine myself a pupil of Bach, helping him out in a moment of stress, when the demands and managerial attitudes of the Leipzig Town Council were becoming impossible, added to the needs of a burgeoning family.""<br/> <br/><b>The performance</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For this monumental performance, we have engaged the services of the </span><u style=""background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://welshbaroqueorchestra.co.uk/en/about_us/introduction.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Welsh Baroque Orchestra</a></u><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  and four renowned soloists, Sian Winstanley (soprano),  Catherine King (mezzo), Peter Wilman (tenor), and Stephen Hamnett (bass). The performance will take place in the magnificent Dora Stoutzker Hall at the </span><u style=""background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.rwcmd.ac.uk/whats_on/events/welsh_camerata.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama</a></u><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, Cardiff, Wales,  on Good Friday 2016 (25 March).

<b>What We Need &amp; What You Get </b><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We aim to raise £4000 towards an estimated overall cost of  £9000.  The main costs will be venue hire (£1,000), orchestra and soloists (approximately £6,000) plus Director's fee, recording and publicity costs.</span><br/></p>
<div>We hope to raise about £3250 directly through ticket sales. Although we have been able to attract small grants from the Welsh Arts Council in the past, we do not have any grant funding for this project. The current economic climate is  very difficult and anyway current funding priorities do not include Early Music. The choir members themselves are determined that the concert will go ahead and  their own personal contributions will help to cover any shortfall.</div>
<div>Our main ambition is to see the St Mark Passion, through this reconstruction, recognised and valued and therefore performed around the world. Our performance on the 25th March will, we hope, showcase this version of the Passion and encourage other choirs to add it to their repertoire. We feel that the best way to do this is to make a high quality downloadable performing edition available online at a very reasonable cost, through the choral music publishers <a href=""http://www.canasg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.canasg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.canasg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Canasg Music</a>. For the purposes of the crowd-funding campaign we are offering a few bound scores together with a limited number of a recordings of the live performance.</div>

</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<p>The Welsh Camerata has an impressive track record of reviving lost works from past centuries.  Our specialism has led us to rediscover a number of forgotten masterpieces, performing them for the first time in Wales since their composition. </p>
<p>At the same time we have encouraged the creation  and performance of new music. Most recently we commissioned the composition of an entirely new oratorio, 'Karuna', written by Andrew Wilson-Dickson, which we performed with soloists Emma Kirkby, Ian Yemm and Paul Carey Jones. </p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456269498/ci88d92c92as1qocmoad.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 125.412px; height: 177px;""/></p>
<p>Our aim is to use the unique dual skills of our director, Andrew Wilson-Dickson as early music specialist and composer, combined with the abilities of the singers in a fabulous venue to champion this sublime work.</p>
<p>The performance will be a springboard to encourage other choirs to add this work to their repertoire.</p>

NEW! You can now donate via PayPal in £, $ or €.


The Welsh Camerata is Wales' premier early music choir, directed by the renowned early music specialist Andrew Wilson-Dickson.  


We will perform a new reconstruction of J S Bach's 'lost' St Mark Passion on Good Friday, 25 March 2016. Tickets for the performance are available from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama box office.

Following the performance the score and parts will be published by   Canasg Music, the online choral publisher.

The PassionThe St Mark is one of four biblical Passions that Bach is known to have composed, of which only two survive in their complete form: St Matthew and St John. It is a ‘parody’ work: owing to time pressures, Bach compiled most of it from music he had already composed for other purposes, a common practice at a time when new music was composed on a weekly basis and was not expected to be kept for posterity.  It was written for Easter 1731 and first performed on Good Friday.                                                                  
Fortunately, we know what that music was, and it is music of quality; remarkably however it shines even brighter in the context of the Passion, as though Bach had known all along that this work was destined for higher purposes. All the existing music can quite easily be matched up with Picander's libretto (which survives in its entirety). But that leaves the recitatives, some arias and the turba choruses without a note.
The ambition

This is an enormously ambitious project, bringing this lost masterpiece back to life on the anniversary of its first performance, Good Friday.
With the help of contributions from you and other music lovers, we can help Bach’s lost Passion to take its rightful place in the canon of great sacred choral works.We want to publish the complete reconstruction, so that other groups can perform the work in the future. The original score will be lodged in the archives of the RWCMD along with Andrew Wilson-Dickson’s working notes, and a recording will be made, providing the fullest possible resource for future generations of Bach enthusiasts.
The reconstructionThere have been a number of previous reconstructions, some of them drawing on the music of Bach's near contemporaries, others simply omitting some of the music. None of these present an ‘authentic’ experience of the original performance, and that is our aim, with music newly composed in the style of the great master filling in all the gaps. As both a composer and early music specialist, Andrew Wilson-Dickson is ideally suited to this task. He says, ""I imagine myself a pupil of Bach, helping him out in a moment of stress, when the demands and managerial attitudes of the Leipzig Town Council were becoming impossible, added to the needs of a burgeoning family."" The performanceFor this monumental performance, we have engaged the services of the Welsh Baroque Orchestra  and four renowned soloists, Sian Winstanley (soprano),  Catherine King (mezzo), Peter Wilman (tenor), and Stephen Hamnett (bass). The performance will take place in the magnificent Dora Stoutzker Hall at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff, Wales,  on Good Friday 2016 (25 March). Details on concert-diary.com. 

   

What We Need & What You Get We aim to raise £4000 towards an estimated overall cost of  £9000.  The main costs will be venue hire (£1,000), orchestra and soloists (approximately £6,000) plus Director's fee, recording and publicity costs.
We hope to raise about £3250 directly through ticket sales. Although we have been able to attract small grants from the Welsh Arts Council in the past, we do not have any grant funding for this project. The current economic climate is  very difficult and anyway current funding priorities do not include Early Music. The choir members themselves are determined that the concert will go ahead and  their own personal contributions will help to cover any shortfall.
Our main ambition is to see the St Mark Passion, through this reconstruction, recognised and valued and therefore performed around the world. Our performance on the 25th March will, we hope, showcase this version of the Passion and encourage other choirs to add it to their repertoire. We feel that the best way to do this is to make a high quality downloadable performing edition available online at a very reasonable cost, through the choral music publishers Canasg Music. For the purposes of the crowd-funding campaign we are offering a few bound scores together with a limited number of a recordings of the live performance.


The Impact


 

The Welsh Camerata has an impressive track record of reviving lost works from past centuries.  Our specialism has led us to rediscover a number of forgotten masterpieces, performing them for the first time in Wales since their composition. 
At the same time we have encouraged the creation  and performance of new music. Most recently we commissioned the composition of an entirely new oratorio, 'Karuna', written by Andrew Wilson-Dickson, which we performed with soloists Emma Kirkby, Ian Yemm and Paul Carey Jones. 

                                                             
Our aim is to use the unique dual skills of our director, Andrew Wilson-Dickson as early music specialist and composer, combined with the abilities of the singers in a fabulous venue to champion this sublime work.
The performance will be a springboard to encourage other choirs to add this work to their repertoire.


Risks & Challenges

 For some 'purists', unless a work is 100% authentic i.e. all Bach's work, they will not feel that it should be performed at all. While recognising that this will not be the original St Mark Passion of 1731, nonetheless we feel that it will give the opportunity for sublime music, which deserves to be heard in the intended setting, to become better known and appreciated.
This reconstruction is a skilful blend of Bach's own music with fresh and vivid music that Andrew Wilson-Dickson has composed, informed by his deep knowledge and understanding of music from this period. It is not a mere academic exercise, but a genuinely dramatic setting for the re-telling of the Easter story.
We have a loyal following, but our concerts are generally on a smaller scale in churches in and around Cardiff. Thus our reputation, while very good, is quite local. We hope that we can generate sufficient excitement around this project in the lead up to the performance, which will help to ensure both a good audience and also act as a springboard for wider recognition of the St Mark Passion a major choral work, which deserves to be heard regularly.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The project ""Music That Will change the world"" is one of my dreams. I will explain it to you. I have started my music journey because I wanted to get my message out to the world and I chose music as my language. Bono once said, that music can change the world because it can change the way people think and that is what I am going for. Nowadays we have a lot of problems, not to mention the economic problems, which are pretty hard to solve, but people are dying inside. The further we go the less compassion and love we see in our daily lives and I really want to change that. We are going to travel to Alp mountains and shoot music videos, all these videos of course will be uploaded on our Youtube channel and all our experiences will be published on our social networks and blogs and we are hoping to get some air time on our local TV and radio stations also, if we get enough funds we will go for international TV and Radio stations.</p>
<p>More info about us and our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a musician,actor,singersongwritter from Lithuania. I started my band called Justin 3 and wrote music. I wrote music about everything. Mostly of course about love. I would not run this campaign if I had the necessary funds. But I am from a very small country and I can't do that. And time is running. That is why I need Your help.</li>
<li>During this campaign I will get my message out to the world in a very creative and beautiful way. Music came from the nature and mountains is the best illustration of our beautiful nature world. And I truly hope that I will inspire people to do good, to love, to believe. And even if it will be a small achievement, but at least I will make world a better place for a small amount of people.</li>
<li>We are planning to travel around alps for a week and shoot 6 music videos, If we manage, we will shoot more.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all we need funds for gas, to travel to Alps and of course we will need somewhere to live and something to eat. We are planning to spend some nights in a tent and capture the beauty of the night, but we will need to get some rest for us to make the music videos at the highest quality it is possible. Also, we will need funds for publishing our campaign, our experiences and to make it available for everyone around the world. </li>
<li>We are offering some perks for contributions, we will release an album of these songs, recorded and performed in alps and we will definitely share it with all of contributors, at least in digital format or even if we will get more funding, in physical. Also official thank you notes and public mentions.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal we will try to fund the rest of the sum ourselves, but if the amount of collected funds will be very small, we will have to abort this mission.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I said before, I hope that this will change the world in a very personal way for everyone, some maybe even find their inner peace, someone will be inspired to pursue their dreams, some maybe will find love again and this all thing, this all emotional impact of course will change the way we all live. For this to happen we need your help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are few challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>The journey will be very tiring and we will have lots of work. This is not an easy task to travel to alps and to shoot music videos. Approximately 6 if we have time we will shoot more. </li>
<li>We will need electric generators for our equipment to run smoothly. And they might fail, so we have a  back up plan, we have chargeable batteries that can recharge our cameras and recording equipment.</li>
<li>Weather might get ugly and we will need to wait, so we are going to add an extra day if we have this kind of problems.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can not contribute but You believe in our cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share this campaign with everyone You can, maybe your friends would like to contribute.</li>
<li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Also if You have connections with TV, Radio stations, Newspapers, Journals please let them know about our project, maybe they will join our cause and will work on publicizing our music videos and our experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Soul Searching </h3>
<div>
<p>In<b> Soul Searching - The Full Length Album</b>, Mark Miller stakes his claim on the music that is his birthright. Mark's father, Ron Miller, brought us songs like “For Once in My Life,” “Touch Me In The Morning,” “Heaven Help Us All” and a string of other amazing hits!  <b>Soul Searching </b>is more than an album, it is a journey though the music Mark grew up with on the streets of the South Side of Chicago and will be a heartfelt tribute to the music his father created.  </p>
<p>The creation of this album is something we have worked on for a long time -- arranging, writing, producing and performing with a group of artists Mark has known for years an is proud to call friends and family.  This album is something you would be proud to be part of!  Come join us! <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>About Mark Arthur Miller</h3>
<p>Mark grew up with his sister, mother, and grandparents.  He had a visceral connection to soul music he couldn’t explain until he heard Stevie Wonder’s 1968 single “For Once in My Life” one day and saw Ron Miller's name on the record label.  He would point at the 45 and tell his South Side friends: “That's my dad!”  Less than three hundred miles away in Detroit, his estranged father was creating a catalogue of Soul treasures.  In the 1970’s, the Miller teenagers re-connected with their dad and moved with him to Los Angeles when Motown relocated their headquarters.</p>
<p>Mark’s early career was focused on athletics and acting.  He co-founded both the Reflections Theatre Ensemble in Chicago and The Road Theater Company in Los Angeles where he acted in plays, on television, and in films.  But he always sang, and sang well -- so well that his father would often have Mark sing demos of his songs. In 1994 Mark began singing and performing in Los Angeles clubs, Ron Miller was almost always in the audience until his death in 2007.  </p>
<p>Mark experimented with musical styles over the years, but ultimately surrendered to the sounds he grew up with. </p>
<p>“I love music, period,” says Mark.  “I started out singing jazz, and I love Sondheim and rock and pop. But I found myself turning every arrangement into Rhythm &amp; Blues.  The truth is, that's my heart, and I'm ready to show it to the world.”<br/><br/>“It’s been awhile coming.  I grew up with this music, and loved it way before my father was even in my life in any meaningful way.  Our relationship was complicated.  He struggled with a gambling addiction, which took... everything.  And it took me some time to come around to this project, to really claim it on my own terms,” says the singer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Where the Money Goes</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Many people who have never been involved in making a record are surprised by the work and funds it takes to complete it. Thanks to your amazing support we've booked time in the studio and we're excited to start showing you some behind the scenes videos and pictures on what we're creating.  </p>
<p>The funding goal is based on what the first half of project cost and all that will need to be accomplished for the finished product to be in your hands.  Also, as in any project, there are extra costs that I will have to take care of.  This budget does not take into account PR costs which are so important in getting your music heard, so anything we raise over our goal will mainly go to that end.</p>

<p>There are some great perks!  Obviously the more you give, the bigger the prize, but every last donation is one I will feel blessed to receive.  Check out the list of PERKS on your right and see how you would like to take part!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The best compliment a musician can receive is  a recommendation of their music. A ""Hey, you have to check this music out!"" to a friend is every artist's dream.  Helping spread the word to people who would like what Soul Searching is about, would be an amazing contribution!  Let's get the word out and make some music!</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support! </p>
</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>A Note From Peter</h3>
<div>I’m very proud to be Musical Director, co-arranger, co-writer and co-producer on this project! Mark has an extremely specific, unique and profound connection to soul music. His story, the story of his show and the story of his album, is one that needs to be seen and heard. The second half of the album— the part yet to be recorded— features not only more revamped arrangements of soul classics (including some by Ron Miller), but also original music in the tradition of Mark’s father, written by Mark and myself. Have a listen on this indie gogo page to the first half of the record and you’ll get a sense of what we are doing. By pre-ordering/supporting, you are making the project happen— straight up! And that includes not just Mark and myself but also Maiya Sykes, Will Artope, Erich Gobel, Laura Mace, Frank Abraham, Jon Stuart, Adam Hawley, Gene Coye and many, many other great musicians who will be gainfully employed and utilized by your support. Thanks for checking it out!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>A Note From Mark</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!  Mark Arthur Miller here, and I would love you to join us in finishing the CD, SOUL SEARCHING!  The album is a tribute to Soul music, with all-new arrangements to classic Soul and Motown hits, songs from my Father’s songbook, and BRAND NEW SONGS written by myself and co-writer Peter Smith.  The CD would also be the completion of the soundtrack for the live stage show “SOUL SEARCHING”!  (Read the reviews: <u><a href=""http://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/BWW-Reviews-Electric-Motown-Music-Relived-at-the-Federal-by-MARK-ARTHUR-MILLER-20150721"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Broadway World</a></u> &amp; <u><a href=""http://markarthurmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MAM_Review.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Music Connection</a>)</u></p>Let's do this thing! </div>

Many people who have never been involved in making a record are surprised by the work and funds it takes to complete it. Thanks to your amazing support we've booked time in the studio and we're excited to start showing you some behind the scenes videos and pictures on what we're creating.  
The funding goal is based on what the first half of project cost and all that will need to be accomplished for the finished product to be in your hands.  Also, as in any project, there are extra costs that I will have to take care of.  This budget does not take into account PR costs which are so important in getting your music heard, so anything we raise over our goal will mainly go to that end.


Recording time in the studio

Editing/Mixing time in the studio

Photography and Artwork 


Mastering of the final recording

Printing of the final CD product

Paying the musicians and engineer (most important of all) They are some of the best in the biz!



The Perks

There are some great perks!  Obviously the more you give, the bigger the prize, but every last donation is one I will feel blessed to receive.  Check out the list of PERKS on your right and see how you would like to take part!

Other Ways You Can Help

The best compliment a musician can receive is  a recommendation of their music. A ""Hey, you have to check this music out!"" to a friend is every artist's dream.  Helping spread the word to people who would like what Soul Searching is about, would be an amazing contribution!  Let's get the word out and make some music!
Thank you all for your support! 


    A Note From Peter
I’m very proud to be Musical Director, co-arranger, co-writer and co-producer on this project! Mark has an extremely specific, unique and profound connection to soul music. His story, the story of his show and the story of his album, is one that needs to be seen and heard. The second half of the album— the part yet to be recorded— features not only more revamped arrangements of soul classics (including some by Ron Miller), but also original music in the tradition of Mark’s father, written by Mark and myself. Have a listen on this indie gogo page to the first half of the record and you’ll get a sense of what we are doing. By pre-ordering/supporting, you are making the project happen— straight up! And that includes not just Mark and myself but also Maiya Sykes, Will Artope, Erich Gobel, Laura Mace, Frank Abraham, Jon Stuart, Adam Hawley, Gene Coye and many, many other great musicians who will be gainfully employed and utilized by your support. Thanks for checking it out!


A Note From Mark
Hi everyone!  Mark Arthur Miller here, and I would love you to join us in finishing the CD, SOUL SEARCHING!  The album is a tribute to Soul music, with all-new arrangements to classic Soul and Motown hits, songs from my Father’s songbook, and BRAND NEW SONGS written by myself and co-writer Peter Smith.  The CD would also be the completion of the soundtrack for the live stage show “SOUL SEARCHING”!  (Read the reviews: Broadway World & Music Connection)Let's do this thing!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our story</h3> <p>Istvan Sky - I am a singer and musician from Hungary, and have been singing since my childhood. I play very special instruments such as the Indian sarod, the Hungarian citera, the guitar and drums. I have a unique healing voice, it's a very interesting combination of tribal singing of ancient Asia and Hungarian folk tradition. I found my teachers in different places in the world, I learnt spiritual music for 15 years and I travel the world today sharing this with people. When I chant I am with the sky, I am with God, and I am in the beauty of the present.</p>

<h3>I'm Back!</h3>
<p>What's up everyone? For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jake, aka Zer0 Gravity, and I'm a rapper. If the name sounds familiar, that's because I've crowdfunded here before, raising over <strong>$1000 </strong> to help fund the first phase of my album.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493762396/besgmudgox9otii6vxwk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Thanks guys!!</p>
<p>After successfully selecting the instrumentals and purchasing them, I moved into the recording stage. Since I have completed the recording, I'm ready to hop into the final stage of my crowdfunding. Thanks to you guys, I was able to fund every single beat using donations! Some of the beats were pretty expensive, but I was able to have a surplus of $100!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493762554/b3nmb95xr2poj5hl0pbh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This one hurt particularly bad...</p>
<p>You're probably wondering, what does a 19-year-old college kid do with $2000 total? That's a great question. I spent the first half on the beats. About $900 to be exact. But that was just the beats.</p>
<p>The mixing/mastering costs $999, which is a lot of money. With the surplus of $100 from the last campaign, I'm asking for another $900 to afford the mixing and mastering of my album.</p>
</div><div><h3>Why Does My Album Need Mixing and Mastering?</h3></div><div>
<p>Because I sure can't do it. Trust me, I've tried.</p>
<p>The last album that I made was funded only by myself. I bought skeezy little beat packages that were basically luck of the draw and used the free month trial of Adobe Auditon to mix and master the vocals. And the vocals sounded like trash (my opinion!).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493762656/djxdi43dayv9wfdu0vtr.png"" src="""" style=""""/>Try as I might, I don't think I'll ever master the Parametric Equalizer</p>
<p>This is because mixing your own vocals is an extremely difficult thing to do, and I don't know how to do it, so I don't want to do it again.</p>
<p>For an album I've worked so hard on, I don't want the vocals to sound too loud or unbalanced because that would ruin the whole project. That would be sad.</p>
<p>I know, I know. $999 for something I could technically do myself? Sounds like a lot. Well, then you probably haven't listened to my first album.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493762806/da09ggbg5vr1lnq0dqju.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It was like someone cranked up the bass on my voice and I had no idea how to fix it</p>
<p>If you compare the way my voice sounds to a mainstream artist's voice, you will definitely hear why I need to get my album sent off to get professionally mixed and mastered. The proof is in the pudding, I promise you that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Should You Help Me?</h3>
<p>If that header sounds snarky I'm sorry. It's hard to convey tone over text.</p>
<p>If you don't know me, you're might be thinking of me as some kid who's just trying to throw an album on Soundcloud to get internet famous for a few days. I promise you that that is not the case.</p>
<p>I want to go on tour, make music videos, connect with people, and really make something out of this.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493773745/s71exvg75vgr4nrhvi8b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If I get famous you can come fly with me in my future private jet!</p>
<p>My dream is to be able to go on stage at a show, and afterward get to hang out with people who like my music. I have a whole life in my head, one where I do this music thing for a career. It's what I love to do and it's never failed me.</p>
<p>If I sound corny or anything, I'm not going to apologize! If I do, it's because I truly mean it. It's something I've wanted for such a long time and I really think that if I work at this enough I can get it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493762937/mkbzdxlsgqthjsrupx0x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hey it's me!</p>
<p>I came into college with the idea that I would graduate and become a researcher. Then I realized that I wouldn't enjoy a life sitting at a lab bench without getting to utilize my creativity. And that's when I started really thinking about what I wanted with my life.</p>
<p>And that's when I started the first phase of this campaign.</p>
<p>If I could, I would just buy everything myself. But, financially speaking, I can't do that right now. That's why I need you guys.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>But Wait, There's More!</h3>
<p>There are some pretty sweet rewards that come with helping me out. My personal favorite is the one where I give you some of the lyrics that I've never used. Some of them are years old, so I promise you that some of them are terrible. And you will enjoy them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here's a short segment of one of them:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Rock just like the Casbah, but I know I can't do squats, because that might break my heart, like literally, straight up</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Amazing</p>
<p>I will freestyle rap to you. Over the phone. Over Skype. In person. I don't care. I'm not great at thinking on my feet so that'll probably be comedic.</p>
<p>If you were around for my first phase, then you saw the big prize at the bottom. If you're wondering, yes, of course, my Timbs are still available! I'll sign them if you want me to, but I mean they're Timbs so you might not want that. You in the market for some Timbs?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493763271/zqiudwgiqnuncffmf9yj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Please, somebody buy my Timbs. They don't fit me they're size 12</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Check out some of the other prizes too! They're pretty awesome!</p>
<p>Also, random fun fact, I've been waiting for a while now but a member of the band X Ambassadors should be getting into contact with me sometime soon. If that ever happens I'll post an update about it to let you know what it was all about!</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Indiegogo suggests I make a section about the risks associated with my project. And there is a big one. If you play my album upon its final release, whatever you're playing it off of might catch fire. Especially if it's a Samsung Note. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493763329/ahdzchicvcmvzjj8jdr2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Semi-topical joke</p>
<p>I'm really sorry for that. I promise it was a joke.</p>
<h3>Final Word</h3>
<p>To anybody who made it this far, thank you so much! If you help me out with any amount, big or small, I will appreciate it so much.</p>
<p>Just knowing that there are people out there who are willing to help me out means the world to me. </p>
<p>If you can't help me by giving money, or even if you do pledge, please share this on Facebook and Twitter and Google+ (no one uses it but why not) or any other social networking site. Exposure will help me out a whole lot, so I'd really appreciate that!</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for helping me make my dream come true. You're the best :)</p>
<h3>New Song Tidbits!</h3>
<p>Below are some previews to 3 of the tracks on my album. Enjoy!</p>
<p>The 3 tidbits, and all of my songs right now are unmastered. The tidbits are parts of songs that I need to get mixed and mastered for my album, which you can probably tell by listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>Tidbit 1</strong></p>
<p>This is probably going to be the opener on the track due to its energy. Also, I think the beat is amazing. The first day I heard it I went outside, listened to it on repeat, and ran around the track for a while.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFru__lhlio?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Tidbit 2</strong></div>
<div>This is a song I made to prove that I can rap fast because some people only think talent comes from that ability. I'm basically just trying to prove myself here. Call it petty, but it had to be done. I also think the lyrics are good too; it's not just a throwaway to prove a point.</div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_RG8y8MkQg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tidbit 3</strong></p>
<p>This song is more of just me having fun on a beat. I talk about my aspirations and goals a little bit, my past, etc. I cover a lot of ground on this track, which you probably won't be able to tell from within this preview, but I promise you I do.</p>

<p>These are some of my older songs and videos that I made a while back. Check them out if you'd like!</p>
<p><strong>GONE</strong></p>
<p>This is my freshman album. It's free to download and I have included some of the tracks below. Click on the link below to be taken to my Bandcamp page with my full album on it. Take a listen! It's also on all major streaming platforms if you'd rather listen there. Just search 'Zer0 Gravity' and I'll show up somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Summertime</strong></p>
<p>This was the closer on my first album 'GONE'. It's a song I wrote to commemorate my youth as well as the friends that I had made throughout my childhood. It was so much fun to write.</p>

<p><strong>Scopin' 2 Music Video (Viewer Discretion Is Advised)</strong></p>
<p>This is a music video I made a few years ago for my song ""Scopin' 2"". It's a part of a storyline I concocted about being an assassin. This is just me having fun with rap, and I love making music videos too so I guess here's one of them!</p>

Thanks to you guys, I was able to fund every single beat using donations! Some of the beats were pretty expensive, but I was able to have a surplus of $100!

This one hurt particularly bad...
You're probably wondering, what does a 19-year-old college kid do with $2000 total? That's a great question. I spent the first half on the beats. About $900 to be exact. But that was just the beats.
The mixing/mastering costs $999, which is a lot of money. With the surplus of $100 from the last campaign, I'm asking for another $900 to afford the mixing and mastering of my album.
Why Does My Album Need Mixing and Mastering?
Because I sure can't do it. Trust me, I've tried.
The last album that I made was funded only by myself. I bought skeezy little beat packages that were basically luck of the draw and used the free month trial of Adobe Auditon to mix and master the vocals. And the vocals sounded like trash (my opinion!).
Try as I might, I don't think I'll ever master the Parametric Equalizer
This is because mixing your own vocals is an extremely difficult thing to do, and I don't know how to do it, so I don't want to do it again.
For an album I've worked so hard on, I don't want the vocals to sound too loud or unbalanced because that would ruin the whole project. That would be sad.
I know, I know. $999 for something I could technically do myself? Sounds like a lot. Well, then you probably haven't listened to my first album.

It was like someone cranked up the bass on my voice and I had no idea how to fix it
If you compare the way my voice sounds to a mainstream artist's voice, you will definitely hear why I need to get my album sent off to get professionally mixed and mastered. The proof is in the pudding, I promise you that.

Why Should You Help Me?
If that header sounds snarky I'm sorry. It's hard to convey tone over text.
If you don't know me, you're might be thinking of me as some kid who's just trying to throw an album on Soundcloud to get internet famous for a few days. I promise you that that is not the case.
I want to go on tour, make music videos, connect with people, and really make something out of this.

If I get famous you can come fly with me in my future private jet!
My dream is to be able to go on stage at a show, and afterward get to hang out with people who like my music. I have a whole life in my head, one where I do this music thing for a career. It's what I love to do and it's never failed me.
If I sound corny or anything, I'm not going to apologize! If I do, it's because I truly mean it. It's something I've wanted for such a long time and I really think that if I work at this enough I can get it.
 
Hey it's me!
I came into college with the idea that I would graduate and become a researcher. Then I realized that I wouldn't enjoy a life sitting at a lab bench without getting to utilize my creativity. And that's when I started really thinking about what I wanted with my life.
And that's when I started the first phase of this campaign.
If I could, I would just buy everything myself. But, financially speaking, I can't do that right now. That's why I need you guys.

But Wait, There's More!
There are some pretty sweet rewards that come with helping me out. My personal favorite is the one where I give you some of the lyrics that I've never used. Some of them are years old, so I promise you that some of them are terrible. And you will enjoy them.
Here's a short segment of one of them:
Rock just like the Casbah, but I know I can't do squats, because that might break my heart, like literally, straight up
Amazing
I will freestyle rap to you. Over the phone. Over Skype. In person. I don't care. I'm not great at thinking on my feet so that'll probably be comedic.
If you were around for my first phase, then you saw the big prize at the bottom. If you're wondering, yes, of course, my Timbs are still available! I'll sign them if you want me to, but I mean they're Timbs so you might not want that. You in the market for some Timbs?

Please, somebody buy my Timbs. They don't fit me they're size 12
 
Check out some of the other prizes too! They're pretty awesome!
Also, random fun fact, I've been waiting for a while now but a member of the band X Ambassadors should be getting into contact with me sometime soon. If that ever happens I'll post an update about it to let you know what it was all about!
Risks
Indiegogo suggests I make a section about the risks associated with my project. And there is a big one. If you play my album upon its final release, whatever you're playing it off of might catch fire. Especially if it's a Samsung Note. 

Semi-topical joke
I'm really sorry for that. I promise it was a joke.
Final Word
To anybody who made it this far, thank you so much! If you help me out with any amount, big or small, I will appreciate it so much.
Just knowing that there are people out there who are willing to help me out means the world to me. 
If you can't help me by giving money, or even if you do pledge, please share this on Facebook and Twitter and Google+ (no one uses it but why not) or any other social networking site. Exposure will help me out a whole lot, so I'd really appreciate that!
Thank you all so much for helping me make my dream come true. You're the best :)
New Song Tidbits!
Below are some previews to 3 of the tracks on my album. Enjoy!
The 3 tidbits, and all of my songs right now are unmastered. The tidbits are parts of songs that I need to get mixed and mastered for my album, which you can probably tell by listening to them.
Tidbit 1
This is probably going to be the opener on the track due to its energy. Also, I think the beat is amazing. The first day I heard it I went outside, listened to it on repeat, and ran around the track for a while.

 
Tidbit 2
This is a song I made to prove that I can rap fast because some people only think talent comes from that ability. I'm basically just trying to prove myself here. Call it petty, but it had to be done. I also think the lyrics are good too; it's not just a throwaway to prove a point.


 
Tidbit 3
This song is more of just me having fun on a beat. I talk about my aspirations and goals a little bit, my past, etc. I cover a lot of ground on this track, which you probably won't be able to tell from within this preview, but I promise you I do.

 
Old Music/Videos
These are some of my older songs and videos that I made a while back. Check them out if you'd like!
GONE
This is my freshman album. It's free to download and I have included some of the tracks below. Click on the link below to be taken to my Bandcamp page with my full album on it. Take a listen! It's also on all major streaming platforms if you'd rather listen there. Just search 'Zer0 Gravity' and I'll show up somewhere.
https://zer0gravityrap.bandcamp.com/releases
Summertime
This was the closer on my first album 'GONE'. It's a song I wrote to commemorate my youth as well as the friends that I had made throughout my childhood. It was so much fun to write.

 
Scopin' 2 Music Video (Viewer Discretion Is Advised)
This is a music video I made a few years ago for my song ""Scopin' 2"". It's a part of a storyline I concocted about being an assassin. This is just me having fun with rap, and I love making music videos too so I guess here's one of them!

 
Baseline Performed Live
Here's a video of my friends and I performing our song ""Baseline"" live. I love performing live.

 
 
Thanks Again!
You guys are great and I love you all. Hopefully this gets completed and I can get this album off of the ground!
If you have any questions, feel free to drop a comment or email me at zer0gravityrap@gmail.com
Thank you!

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>So far, we have booked a few local shows in our area, but touring is expensive. There are a lot of associated costs to do it well. We want to be able to bring our fans a comprehensive and powerful performance! The more places we can get to this year, the more we can offer our genuine brand of music to you. </p>
<p>Being able to perform over 30 dates this year is the bands goal. Doing so will mean we have accomplished more than ever before, but we need your help! Our fans and supporters are everything to our success.</p>
<p>Brett, Chris and Warren thank you,</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will keep it simple</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 to support touring costs</li>
<li>This money will used for the following:<ul>
<li>travel costs - this includes fuel, rentals and hospitality</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The result of a successful tour, could lead to massive opportunity potential for the band. Playing in a original band is tough work. It requires a ton of man hours, for often a very limited return. The only way bands can be successful, in any measure, is to expose their music.

<p>Your help will  drive our careers as artists forward. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges when touring. The unexpected costs, like vehicles breaking down, bands not showing up, equipment malfunctioning. These are just a small summary of costs that come up during tour. Being prepared for them, and having the appropriate resources really  assists in mitigating these pitfalls.</p>
<p>We have a smart strategy in place to avoid many of these things from occurring. We have put in the man hours and preparation strategy necessary to make this tour successful. Money is the only inhibitor.</p>

À l’age de 6 ans, j’ai émigré en France avec ma famille et à 30 ans j’ai émigré au Canada où je suis maintenant résident permanent.La guitare a toujours fait partie de ma vie, j’ai commencé à l’âge de 8 ans avec la guitare classique espagnole puis ensuite je me suis intéressé à d'autres styles : jazz, rock, reggae, musique brésilienne, juive… J’ai beaucoup joué en France dans des groupes et projets variés, puis à 26 ans j’ai eu un profond besoin de revenir à mon premier amour : la guitare classique. Pendant 7 ans,  je me suis donc plongé corps et âme dans ce retour aux sources et après une maîtrise en guitare classique à l’Université de Montréal, j’ai décidé d'élaborer ma propre musique en mélangeant toutes mes influences. Entre 2012 et 2015, j’ai auto-produit 3 albums regroupant reprises et compositions, et effectué des concerts et tournées au Canada, aux USA et en Israel, en solo ou avec mon quartet. Ma participation au Festival de Jazz de Montréal en 2016 a été un bel encouragement pour poursuivre dans cette voie.[ voir la vidéo du concert ] UN ALBUM CONCEPT Le désir de créer un album encore plus personnel et intime a alors émergé. Un album concept contenant uniquement des compositions originales pensées autour d’une unité thématique est né : Oriental Blue.J’ai alors imaginé une suite musicale autour de ce thème en sélectionnant parmi mes compositions des pièces à couleurs orientale et méditerranéenne et en en créant de nouvelles dans la même inspiration.Visionnez la première vidéo (haut de page) pour en savoir plus, et... je vous conseille d'attendre la fin ;)En 2017 on m’a proposé de participer à un concert à Paris. Comme il était compliqué de former un quartet sur place, j’ai décidé d’expérimenter le projet en duo. J’ai donc invité un ami de longue date, avec qui j'ai souvent joué à Paris, le saxophoniste Mathias Wallerand, avec l'intuition que cette musique allait parler à ses origines libano-arméniennes.L’alchimie a été immédiate et Mathias est venu à son tour en octobre 2017 peaufiner cette musique avec moi et nous avons effectué une tournée au Québec et en Ontario, dans plusieurs lieux dont le Rex Jazz Club à Toronto. En mars 2018, lors d’un bref séjour à Paris, nous en avons profité pour enregistrer le projet. Il restait ensuite toutes les étapes de post-production à réaliser (mixage, mastering, pochette, promotion…) et une tournée de lancement à organiser pour que ce projet prenne vie! POURQUOI VOTRE SOUTIEN?Nous connaissons tous l'évolution actuelle de l'industrie du disque liée à internet et au streaming.

<h3>Beneath The Night Sky</h3>
<p>This CD began two years ago when a guitar of mine was broken that previously belonged to a deceased friend. I was quite upset about this however a few nights later, I laid down on the grass looking up to the stars. This gave me a sense of peace with everything that had recently happened and it was the catalyst for me to start composing Beneath The Night Sky. I have spent countless nights awake composing and fine tuning each song. I worked very hard throughout 2017 to pay for a Seaboard which was used throughout this CD. </p>
<p>I was very lucky to have my good friend Perrin produce and engineer this CD. He is a classically trained violinist however produces electronic music. He was the perfect producer for the job as he was able to help me find the balance between classical music as well as post rock. </p>
<p>We were scheduled to record this CD from January through to June however he relocated to the UK at the end of February. I was going to have my dear friend Jordan be the assistant producer for this album but he sadly passed away soon before we commenced recording. He did record my harp on one song and he played guitar on that same song. There were many hardships along the way with this project however we managed to record all of it by the end of February. Both Sleepy J and Tim Fischer have been featured as accompanying musicians on this CD.</p>
<p>Perrin has done an amazing job mixing this CD and it is about to get mastered. Soon afterwards I will be getting the CDs pressed and I will hold a launch concert. The funding will go towards the CDs being pressed and the launch concert.</p>

<h2>BREAK MY FEARS</h2>
<p>Do you remember a time when you have been crippled by the weight of fear? I have. For the last 7 or so years I have had the awesome opportunity writing worship songs to the Lord. It’s actually one of the main ways that I spend time with the Lord. I open up the scriptures, read, meditate, and part of my response is through song. I remember moments of tremendous peace in difficult times, joy in heavy times, and gratitude when faced with inconvenient situations. But if I’m being completely honest, my hang up has been being faithful in sharing these songs. I actually have had a similar response to Moses:</p>
<p><strong>But Moses said to the LORD, <i>“Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.” - </i>Exodus 4:10</strong></p>
<p>I’ve made so many excuses over the years. Just ask my wife! Just like in the parable of the talents in<a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A14-30&amp;version=ESV"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Matthew 25:14-30</a>, I am the servant that has buried his one talent and kept it to himself. But just like the Lord has called the servants to be faithful and invest what they have, the Lord has called me to be faithful in sharing my music. I am excited and honestly frightened to announce my very first campaign to release a 5-Song EP in 2019! After much time of prayer we are calling it <i>“BREAK MY FEARS”</i>. Those three words are the very journey I’ve been on and it’s what I have been singing and praying over the last year. As the Lord leads &amp; guides, I believe that the Lord will provide for exactly what He wants. We are praying boldly that the Lord would provide for a total 5-song EP, but we also know that <strong><i>“A man's heart plans his course, but the LORD directs his steps”</i> </strong>(Proverbs 16:9). Ultimately we are open to all that the Lord is going to do! Would you be willing to consider joining me on this next step of the journey?</p>
<h3>PRODUCER</h3>
<p>I am excited to announce that I am partnering with Phil Shawel who is a producer based out of Illinois. Phil has worked with many great artists including <a href=""https://www.verticalofficial.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Vertical Worship</i></a>, <a href=""https://www.willowcreek.org/en/blogs/south-barrington/only-god-ep"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Willow Creek Music</i></a>, <a href=""http://central.live/welcome"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Central Live</i>,</a> <a href=""https://chcc.org/cherry-hills-worship/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Cherry Hills Worship</i></a> &amp; more!</p>

<h3>An Introduction...</h3>
<p>We are <strong>The Autumnatic</strong>, a band from Grand Rapids, MI.</p>
<p>We've been working on our debut album and we are hoping you will consider being part of our team! Since The Autumnatic came together over two years ago, we have grown not only as musicians and songwriters, but we have been able to share our music with thousands of people! In order to take our collection of songs to as many people as possible, we need to produce an album that showcases what we have worked so hard to create. That of course isn’t something that happens for free, and the industry contacts, friends, and shows will only take us so far. That is why we need your help financially. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're aiming for a goal of $10,000 to help us cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering </li>
<li>Mixing</li>
<li>Mastering</li>
<li>Pressing (creation of the physical album)</li>
<li>Digital Distribution</li>
<li>Advertising and Promotion of the album</li>
<li>Merchandise</li>
</ul>
<p>We realize this number might seem like a lot to some, but as you can see, there is a lot more to putting out an album than meets the eye. While we have covered some of what is on this list by playing shows, everything on this list begins to add up quickly! Our proposed goal will cover all costs associated with the creation of this album. If we exceed this goal, this will allow additional promotion of the album, design and printing of merchandise, and necessary instrument maintenance and upgrades.</p>
<h3>What You Can Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early Access to the Album</li>
<li>Private House Concerts</li>
<li>Handwritten lyric sheets</li>
<li>An Invitation to our Private Album Listening Party</li>
<li><i>Check the Rewards section to see a full list!</i></li>
</ul>
<p>As we make progress on this project, you'll also receive updates, videos of us abusing Scott, and sneak peaks of the songs as they come along! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're so excited to share our debut album with you! Over the past year we have written quite a collection of songs, and we've narrowed it down to what we feel are the strongest.</p>
<p>Drawing diverse influence across all genres, we've found ourselves being described as: Pop-Rock Baptized in Blues &amp; R&amp;B. It’s honest, energetic and most of all...FUN! We've been getting a terrific reaction to these songs everywhere we've played them live, and we want to share them in a fresh new way, and reach even more people with them!! </p>
<p>We feel so lucky to have met so many people and made so many awesome fans in our time as a band, and we want to be able to share our hard work with you in the form of lovingly and expertly captured songs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges whenever it comes to a project like this. One of the big ones is promoting the album. In this ""digital age"" we live in, music is accessible on every device imaginable, at any time, in any place. That has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>We want to reach the largest audience possible and the biggest challenges we're facing are what we need your help on the most. Your donation goes towards more than just the creation of the album. It will also help us do things such as...</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Ryan Smith, 29 years old,  founder &amp; owner of i99Radio.com which I started June 1st 2014! I started this radio station, to let the world know about the different types &amp; diverse alternative rock music there! I also wanted to keep it commercial free, and available to the world while playing local Philadelphia music, mixing it in with smaller indie rock bands around the world, and including main stream rock bands as well. </p>
<p>The past 4 years have been the best years of my life. Because of this, I've been able to meet so many incredible bands, make new friends, interview artist I never dreamed I would have been able to, and more so recently, been photographing shows in photo pits by obtaining photo passes. </p>
<p>Right now, I'm ready to take on my next journey, and to launch an i99Radio app that is available worldwide for everyone to use! I hope you can help me with this process by donating to my Indiegogo campaign. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>I've been in talks with two local app developer teams in the Philadelphia area. They have both quoted me approximately $4,500 to get this app perfect &amp; include all the features we want. I set the goal for $5,500, with some stretch goals because I'm sure there will be some extra costs along the way &amp; leaves some breathing room for any potential problems. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Features in the app</h3>
<p>The finished app will have the following included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Total listening: including background listening &amp; listening while exploring on the app!</li>
<li>Daily Contests: we will have different contests daily for free signed band merch, tickets to shows around the world, i99Radio merch &amp; more!</li>
<li>Complete Interaction: Our new app will include a chatbox where you can interact live with other listeners &amp; the DJ’s / admins!</li>
<li>Set Alarm: Have a daily alarm set so you can wake up to i99Radio every morning!</li>
<li>Check the last 10 songs that played on i99Radio</li>
<li>Voice in: Send a recording (upto 30 seconds) to us chatting with the DJ or requesting a song, right from the app! No additional things needed! </li>
<li>Vote Up/ Vote Down: Your opinions are important to us. We’re finally implementing a voting system where you can let us know which song you like or dislike. Furthermore, you will be able to see all the songs you have liked in your user profile, so you can remember that cool song you just discovered later on!</li>
<li>New Music Discovery: Every week there will be a new update on the i99Radio New Music Discovery page - where you will discover a new band, and have access to download their latest song / album or EP for FREE. We're currently working with many artists around the world to include them in this feature. </li>
<li>Switch mode: Go from dark to light mode with one tap (like Twitter, Youtube &amp; Twitch) so you can use what your eyes prefer! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>

</div></div>","About Me
Hey, I'm Ryan Smith, 29 years old,  founder & owner of i99Radio.com which I started June 1st 2014! I started this radio station, to let the world know about the different types & diverse alternative rock music there! I also wanted to keep it commercial free, and available to the world while playing local Philadelphia music, mixing it in with smaller indie rock bands around the world, and including main stream rock bands as well. 
The past 4 years have been the best years of my life. Because of this, I've been able to meet so many incredible bands, make new friends, interview artist I never dreamed I would have been able to, and more so recently, been photographing shows in photo pits by obtaining photo passes. 
Right now, I'm ready to take on my next journey, and to launch an i99Radio app that is available worldwide for everyone to use! I hope you can help me with this process by donating to my Indiegogo campaign. 

The Cost
I've been in talks with two local app developer teams in the Philadelphia area. They have both quoted me approximately $4,500 to get this app perfect & include all the features we want. I set the goal for $5,500, with some stretch goals because I'm sure there will be some extra costs along the way & leaves some breathing room for any potential problems. 

Features in the app
The finished app will have the following included: 

Total listening: including background listening & listening while exploring on the app!
Daily Contests: we will have different contests daily for free signed band merch, tickets to shows around the world, i99Radio merch & more!
Complete Interaction: Our new app will include a chatbox where you can interact live with other listeners & the DJ’s / admins!
Set Alarm: Have a daily alarm set so you can wake up to i99Radio every morning!
Check the last 10 songs that played on i99Radio
Voice in: Send a recording (upto 30 seconds) to us chatting with the DJ or requesting a song, right from the app! No additional things needed! 
Vote Up/ Vote Down: Your opinions are important to us. We’re finally implementing a voting system where you can let us know which song you like or dislike. Furthermore, you will be able to see all the songs you have liked in your user profile, so you can remember that cool song you just discovered later on!
New Music Discovery: Every week there will be a new update on the i99Radio New Music Discovery page - where you will discover a new band, and have access to download their latest song / album or EP for FREE. We're currently working with many artists around the world to include them in this feature. 
Switch mode: Go from dark to light mode with one tap (like Twitter, Youtube & Twitch) so you can use what your eyes prefer! 


Rewards: 
We have many rewards we are giving out, including signed CD Booklets from Imagine Dragons, The 1975, Twenty One Pilots, Wolf Alice, Bishop Briggs, Vance Joy & Much more! 
We also have many signed photos we're giving away, including Paramore, Panic! At the Disco, Imagine Dragons, Twenty One Pilots & more! 
Can't contribute that much? No problem! Donate $3 to have your name on our website, or $5 to get the app ad free for a year! ($29 value when we launch it!)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Dillon Vado, I'm a <a href=""http://www.dillonvado.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">drummer/vibraphonist composer and educator </a>in the San Francisco Bay Area. I started my newest band, Never Weather, in January of this year and we have been playing live shows all over the Bay Area since. </p>
<p>The music I wrote for this band is very special and the way these particular people bring it all to life was nothing short of magical from our very<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUiMqvXZRw4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> first show</a>. After going deeper into the pieces in various live settings, I feel that this group is ready to record an album, and the music deserves the high quality attention that can only be generated from a professional recording studio. </p>
<p>This is why we need your help, recording is expensive and frankly without a little bit of outside help, this type of thing would simply never happen. Releasing a real album will help us to </p>

<p><strong>NORTHEAST</strong></p>
<p><i>""It's hard to tell which is heavier, the concrete sky or this tiny town. You wonder why I say I'm like the weather; as unforgiving as the January ground..."" - Northeast</i></p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed some incredible adventures across a diverse range of musical landscapes in my 20+ years as a career musician. From the grange halls where I grew up learning traditional fiddle tunes to international cultural diplomacy tours and Broadway stages, I’ve been humbled and inspired by it all. Northeast is my 7<sup>th</sup> studio album, and the third with my alt-country band Daisycutter, roots music veterans all. From my farm girl roots to the cities, towns, and wide-open spaces I’ve experienced touring nationally and beyond, this album explores the stories of the Northeast, from rural to Rust Belt. This campaign will make possible not only the recording and production of the album, but enable promotional support upon its release. We are timing the campaign to end on the first day of Winter, ushering in the season of reflection and rebirth here in the Northeast.</p>
<p><strong>THE ALBUM </strong></p>
<p>We are taciturn upstate New Yorkers. Sharing our feelings can be an uphill battle at times for us. We're not all that comfortable in situations that can't be assuaged with a socket wrench or a casserole. We're pretty much adrift in this brave new world that thrives on the constant sharing of bits of ourselves.</p>
<p>We're making a new album.</p>
<p>We expected to be excited about this whole undertaking, and wow, are we ever inspired by the music coming out of it. But it's a little too intense to feel quite so... sparkly... Winter's long shadow is peeking around the corner. It's an honest time of year, an unyielding one, an unforgiving one. These songs are the hardy fruit borne of those creative seeds that survived the frost. We're more proud of, more invested in, and feel these songs represent us more honestly than ever. We want more than anything to release them into the light of spring. It means everything to us to be able to share our music with others who want to listen. Hopefully these songs will mean as much to you as they do to us.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us bring this album to completion, read on! We have various (hopefully interesting!) ways you can choose to be involved. And your support means everything to us. We might be awkward introverts, but we know it takes a village.</p>
<p>Thank you, truly.<br/><br/>-Sara</p>
<p><i>This album is dedicated to our dear departed band mate, friend, and brother-in-music, Andy Goessling. Thank you, Andy, for casting such a long, wonderful shadow these last ten years. We will miss you more than we'll ever be able to say. (Partially because we're taciturn Northerners, and not good with words anyway.)</i></p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>Asking for support for this project is just as challenging as emoting for us quiet, Northern-types. But as full time working musicians, we need your help to get these songs out into the world (and also let the world know they’re out there!)</p>
<p>We are aiming for $15,000. Half of that will cover the cost of recording: the studio time, musicians, mixing/mastering, artwork, and production of physical copies of the album and merchandise. The other half will enable us to hire a publicist to help us get the word out to press and radio. In a digitally-driven, DIY world, that promotional support is essential to helping us cut through the competition and build momentum for our music.</p>
<p>In late September, we went into the studio and laid down the basic tracks for five songs - half the record! We are fortunate: as professional musicians, we have access to home recording equipment and a producer with the skills and experience to make the most of them, enabling us significant savings in studio time. But acoustic instruments are still notoriously challenging to record, and we don’t want to cut corners on getting the best sounds possible, so we are working with the wonderful Justin Guip at Milan Hill Studio in Red Hook, NY to get some amazing sounds down on our basic tracks.</p>
<p>Every bit helps! But if we don’t quite reach our entire goal, the funds we have will go towards the production of the album and fulfillment of the perks, with whatever funds are left earmarked for publicity and promotion of its release. Our priority is fulfilling our promises to our supporters first and foremost!</p>
<p><strong>THE PERKS</strong></p>
<p><strong>- <i>Northeast </i>signed CD</strong></p>
<p><strong>- <i>Northeast </i>digital download</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>- Northeast </i></strong><strong>signed CD, download, plus handwritten recipe cards of some of Sara’s favorite family recipes (no casseroles, oddly enough)</strong></p>
<p><strong>- <i>Daisycutter t-shirts, coffee mugs, </i>plus other cool merch</strong></p>
<p><strong>- <i>Fiddle lessons with Sara (Skype or in-person)</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>- Backyard chicken keeping consultation with Sara (Skype or in-person)</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>- Sara records fiddle on YOUR songs!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>- House Concerts</i></strong><br/><strong><i>+ MORE!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Making an album is a challenging undertaking. We have half the material arranged, with basic tracking already completed. The other half will take time and creative and technical energy! Round 2 of basic tracking, as well as overdubs and adding the musical icing is scheduled for this winter, as we’re planning a spring 2019 release. The biggest challenge is the unknown: life, scheduling snafus, and snowstorms! There’s no predicting what obstacles might pop up, but as professional musicians, we’re also professional problem-solvers, with hundreds of hours of recording experience.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></p>
<p>Help comes in many forms! Apart from contributing to the campaign, you can help us tremendously by sharing this campaign with other like-minded folks who might be interested in what we’re doing! Help us make some noise by using the Indiegogo share tools here!</p>
<p>You can also keep in touch the old-fashioned way by joining our email list (<a href=""http://www.daisycutter.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">daisycutter.net</a>) to see when we’ll be in your neck of the woods – we’d love to connect!</p>

CHALLENGES
Making an album is a challenging undertaking. We have half the material arranged, with basic tracking already completed. The other half will take time and creative and technical energy! Round 2 of basic tracking, as well as overdubs and adding the musical icing is scheduled for this winter, as we’re planning a spring 2019 release. The biggest challenge is the unknown: life, scheduling snafus, and snowstorms! There’s no predicting what obstacles might pop up, but as professional musicians, we’re also professional problem-solvers, with hundreds of hours of recording experience.
