Our Grainbill and Hops Schedule

 
Initially, with Phase I, we will purchase and install our first brewing system into the lower level of The Liberty building.  This includes the purchase of the brewing system itself, building the production room, adding fermentation and refrigeration equipment, plumbing and electrical, venting and exhaust, and all the minor details in between.  We will quickly start producing and distributing to area establishments who are already anxious to put us on tap.
  





In Phase II we will construct our ""troll cave"" taproom for a welcoming community gathering place where we will offer tastings, pints, growler fills, and limited edition bottles.  In Phase III we will grow into our larger system to extend our boundaries of distribution and expand our bottling capabilities.

Fermenting and Lagering
We pitched the yeast with an initial goal of $25,000, but - if we surpass this goal - then we will raise the bar (literally and figuratively) with a stretch goal to quickly initiate Phase II with our Angry Troll Taproom.  Of course, if we blow the roof off this campaign - we will introduce and march onward into Phase III with our larger system.  Join us on our journey!  Plus, you get some pretty cool gear at any contribution level!

It is noted for providing considerably more energy and vigour, natural body detoxification, quality of sleep, circulation and immune system support and promoting health and longevity.</span><p><br/></p><div>

No jitters or caffeine crash due to the infusion of Ganoderma Lucidum which oxygenates the body. </span><p></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The extra value of my business is with the reishi mushroom.

Awesomely, the presence of Ganoderma neutralizes the negative side effects of caffeine so you get the ""boost"" with out the ""crash"" from caffeine. Health is wealth, is what I want to share with the world. </span><div>

Angkor Wat is the largest religious monument and Hindu temple complex in the world situated in the jungle. Being there, one can gets a sense of cosmic consciousness. This is just a brief summary of my background, dances of light and shadow, Lila in Sanskrit means divine plays and my sister's name.This campaign is just one of my many entrepreneurship that can assist me and my family to obtain financial abundance and prosperity through healthy quality coffee and more. The 100% Certified Organic Ganoderma in Organo Gold has over 150 antioxidants and phytonutrients, and is backed up in modern science clinical studies. It is noted for providing considerably more energy and vigour, natural body detoxification, quality of sleep, circulation and immune system support and promoting health and longevity.
Your contributions will help me to spread the many healthy benefits of the Ganoderma Lucidum mushroom through rich tasty delicious beverages, nutraceutically, and hygienically. This species has been used for thousands of years by the Chinese for natural healing, it has been respectfully called the ""Mushroom of Immortality."" Originally reserved for the “Royalty” of Chinese, regarded as one of the highest valued and treasured herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. The mushroom is well-known as a tonic for supporting general wellness and vitality. What regular coffee is known to do to the body is it dehydrates the body, very acidic and toxic, raises blood pressure, raises the stress level due to increased cortisol, coffee jitters and caffeine crash. Organo Gold Coffee balances pH level of the body, natural detoxification, increased the immune system and provides energy. No jitters or caffeine crash due to the infusion of Ganoderma Lucidum which oxygenates the body. 

What We Need & What You Get
I will need $1,500 dollars to invest in the Organo Gold Coffee promotional gold pack: OG Gourmet Black (15 boxes), OG Gourmet Mocha (10 boxes), OG Gourmet Latte (15 boxes), OG Hot Chocolate (6 boxes), OG Organic Green Tea (6 boxes). Includes in this pack will be nutraceutical and hygienic products also. I will be one of their distributors via e-mail and personal delivery, which I have already signed up for.
The perks are listed to the right accordingly base on the amount the donors contribute.
The funds will still go to my business endeavor if I don't reach my entire goal; it will get me one step closer to my goal. With any business there is some risk involve. I have got nothing to loose. This company has been around for five years; it is up to the individual drives on how successful their business will be. You won't know until you try.


The Impact
The extra value of my business is with the reishi mushroom. Help me to help others by spreading the consumption of Ganoderma Lucidum mushroom. This herb is used to boost your immune system and is said to carry anti-aging properties, help with weight loss, and possibly help prevent certain types of cancer. Organo Gold Gourmet brand coffee is caffeinated with 9 grams or less of caffeine, in comparison to other coffee brands that have numbers at 135 to 330 grams of caffeine. Awesomely, the presence of Ganoderma neutralizes the negative side effects of caffeine so you get the ""boost"" with out the ""crash"" from caffeine. Health is wealth, is what I want to share with the world. 
I am a permaculturist who care deeply for my surrounding wherever I go. In the past, my friend and I had a compost delivery service in Long Beach, Ca. Then I left the city to learn and live more sustainably at an Earthship community in Taos, New Mexico and Southern Colorado. While out there, I met Paul Stamets, the mushroom guy, at a tribal festival that I help to coordinate. He was giving a discourse on the many functions of mushroom and its restorative impact on the environment, myco remediation. During his discussions the Ganoderma Lucidum or reishi mushroom was mentioned.

<p><b>Here’s a
Crazy Idea…let’s End World Hunger!</b></p>
<p><b>This is your chance to get involved in something so good and truly
worthwhile, it will make your heart sing…</b></p>
<p><br/>
Our campaign is about 2 things:</p>
<p>1. Feeding Hungry Kids. Getting
nutritious food in their hands (and bellies)</p>
<p>2. Doing R and D to make that food even
better!</p>
<p><b>Best of all, it only takes a couple of minutes</b></p>
<p>You are minutes away from dramatically
improving the lives and health of children that go to school hungry and adding
dignity to the lives of the homeless who spend too much of their day
desperately hoping for their next meal.</p>
<p><b>You can mend someone’s broken heart, make them feel loved and give them
hope for the future, just by doing this one simple thing…</b></p>
<p>Stopping
their hunger. at RTG, we feel passionately that it's NOT good enough to give
the hungry the scraps we don't want to eat ourselves. If anything, the hungry
need MORE nutritious food to get their health and lives back on track. Optimeal
is formulated to give the undernourished the nutritional boost they need. And
it tastes great!</p>
<p><b>Here’s how to do good immediately and get something cool in the process…</b></p>
<p>The
perks you see on the right are different ways you can help the hungry and
satiate your own appetite. Everyone wins! </p>
<p>By
selecting a perk you can do the following:</p>
<p><b>1. You Can Show You Care by Feeding Hungry Kids: </b>You can choose to buy food for others by feeding 1 (""The Nice
Guy""), 5 (""The Saint"") or 10 (""The Benevolent Deity"")
kids for an entire month.</p>
<p><b>2. You Can Grab a Sick T-Shirt: </b>You can
get a T-shirt for yourself (the ""Compassion is King"" perk).</p>
<p><b>3. You can receive while you give: </b>You can feed a kid while feeling the nutritious effects of Optimeal
yourself for a FULL MONTH with the ""RTG"" or ""Superhero
Pack"" perks.</p>
<p><b>4. Team Building: </b>And for
businesses... We offer a team build program that will transform your
organization while feeding hundreds or even thousands of kids. Pretty cool
right! Bring this one to the boss and you'll look like a hero :)</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?! Pick the
perk that you know is right for you.  Let’s end hunger together!</p>

<p>Call us crazy, but we
believe the answer is yes! In fact, our <b>5-year plan</b> is nothing short of <b>ending
hunger in the developed </b>world while simultaneously putting a massive dent
in hunger elsewhere through our other programs. With the deals we are already

<p><span>And, if the history of

<br/><h4><b>The Story of RTG’s Conception</b></h4>
<p>Stephen Clarke has
lived an interesting life. He played <b>professional hockey for 5 years</b>,
but was forced to move on after blowing out his knee. He also experienced
massive success (and his fair share of failures!) in business with <b>a
world-renowned talent in the advertising industry.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><span>One day, Stephen
decided he had <b>made his living.</b> Now, he thought, it was time for him to <b>make
a difference.</b> But, with a world full of problems, it's hard to know where
to start! So, he took the easy way out and asked <b>his mother</b> what to
do. 

</span></p>
<p><span>She explained that she
simply couldn't understand why homelessness remained a problem in the developed
world. She suggested he focus on ending homelessness. A tall order, but
everyone knows <b>you can’t say no to the requests of your mother!</b></span></p>
<b>
</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446070729/a05nvgf4oixcjply625t.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Stephen decided that <b>building a massive homeless shelter</b> would be a good way to appease her. But, the price tag on <b>a 20+ story homeless shelter</b> is NOT a small one. So, it was time for Stephen to start another business. However, this one <b>couldn't be only profit driven, but also had to be a vehicle to do good.</b></p>
<b></b><p>Another, cause Stephen cared about deeply was feeding starving children. So, with his wife Svetlana, he developed an innovative business model that would generate financing from <b>feeding 50,000 starving children a month </b>to build a homeless shelter and sustain it.</p>
<p>However, it didn't take long before Stephen’s <b>creative business strategy</b> roots kicked in and for the business to start scaling much faster than anticipated. Suddenly through innovative corporate team-building programs, deals with a few <b>massive organizations</b>, and the addition of valuable partners, RTG’s original projections suddenly had to be updated. The 5-year plan to feed 50,000 kids a month became a plan to feed<b> 1.2 million kids a month in just 2 years. </b>And, the new 5-year plan is to eliminate hunger all together.</p>

<div><b>FAQ</b></div>
<div><b>I don't live in North-America, why should I donate? </b></div>
<div>First of all, you can definitely get some Optimeal for yourself and help us perfect the taste and formula regardless of where you are. Furthermore, we can certainly ship Optimeal to a charity in your country that accepts food donations. Keep in mind though, we don't have formal partnerships everywhere yet so we can't guarantee we'll be able to personally vet all the charities we send the food to.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>What Ingredients are in Optimeal?</b></div>
<div>Here is an example of the ingredients in our trail-mix Optimeal bars: </div>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Is your price to feed a kid good value?</b></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We consider our price to feed a kid FANTASTIC value. The industry standard for charities that do the same sort of thing we do is up at around 35 USD per month. Not only are we less expensive, we also have a more efficient and transparent model.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><b>How do you decide what causes to focus on next with your profits?</b></div>
<div>We deal with organizations and companies around the world. Often, the causes we focus on are the result of where the biggest of these deals are happening.

We try to leave something life-changing wherever we go!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>How do you feed so many kids?</b></div>
<div>We are able to feed such huge amounts of kids because our business model often takes a top-down approach.

do. 


She explained that she
simply couldn't understand why homelessness remained a problem in the developed
world. She suggested he focus on ending homelessness. A tall order, but
everyone knows you can’t say no to the requests of your mother!



Stephen decided that building a massive homeless shelter would be a good way to appease her. But, the price tag on a 20+ story homeless shelter is NOT a small one. So, it was time for Stephen to start another business. However, this one couldn't be only profit driven, but also had to be a vehicle to do good.
Another, cause Stephen cared about deeply was feeding starving children. So, with his wife Svetlana, he developed an innovative business model that would generate financing from feeding 50,000 starving children a month to build a homeless shelter and sustain it.
However, it didn't take long before Stephen’s creative business strategy roots kicked in and for the business to start scaling much faster than anticipated. Suddenly through innovative corporate team-building programs, deals with a few massive organizations, and the addition of valuable partners, RTG’s original projections suddenly had to be updated. The 5-year plan to feed 50,000 kids a month became a plan to feed 1.2 million kids a month in just 2 years. And, the new 5-year plan is to eliminate hunger all together.




Join RTG in this exciting journey that just keeps expanding in its ambition. With your help our mission to end world hunger may be achieved sooner than we ever thought possible!

FAQ
I don't live in North-America, why should I donate? 
First of all, you can definitely get some Optimeal for yourself and help us perfect the taste and formula regardless of where you are. Furthermore, we can certainly ship Optimeal to a charity in your country that accepts food donations. Keep in mind though, we don't have formal partnerships everywhere yet so we can't guarantee we'll be able to personally vet all the charities we send the food to.

What Ingredients are in Optimeal?
Here is an example of the ingredients in our trail-mix Optimeal bars: 
Whole grain rolled oats, grains (barley, wheat), sesame seeds, quinoa, raisins, sunflower seed, honey, dried blueberries (blueberries, sugar, sunflower oil), brown flax seed, whey protein isolate, high oleic sunflower oil, coconut, maple syrup, almonds.
We hope to continue to to perfect our formulation to make it even healthier and more effective. Order some for yourself and give us a hand!

Is your price to feed a kid good value?

We consider our price to feed a kid FANTASTIC value. The industry standard for charities that do the same sort of thing we do is up at around 35 USD per month. Not only are we less expensive, we also have a more efficient and transparent model.


How do you decide what causes to focus on next with your profits?
We deal with organizations and companies around the world. Often, the causes we focus on are the result of where the biggest of these deals are happening. With thousands and thousands of kids being fed at a time, we can dedicated substantial profits do something meaningful for that region and culture. We try to leave something life-changing wherever we go!

How do you feed so many kids?
We are able to feed such huge amounts of kids because our business model often takes a top-down approach. We approach the decisions makers of companies and organizations and construct win-win partnerships that have us feeding thousands of kids at a time. It's this approach that has us on a pace to feed so many kids within the next 5 years.

<br/>Hi!
<p>I'm mg. You might know me, but if this goes well, odds are that you don't. A bunch of years back I started the 93/94 Magic format; it's a casual approach to the Magic the Gathering card game. For the last couple of years, I've been blogging about it at <a href=""http://oldschool-mtg.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">oldschoolmtg.com</a>. <br/></p>
<p>But this is not about that. This is about people not in the #mtgunderground, but in the real underground. </p>
<p>There are more refugees today than during WW2 and the Holocaust. About one in every 122 humans on the planet are forcefully displaced today. So far the conflict in Syria have killed a quarter of a million, and forced millions to run from their homes. Doctors without borders has reported that suppliers in Syria refuse to sell 
essential medical supplies such as gauze and surgical threads to doctors
 due to government intimidation. This is, to put it mildly, fucked up.</p>
<p>I wont retell the horror stories we've all heard, mostly as I can't really grasp them. I have
 spent 15 months training in the Swedish military, but I never went to a
 war. People fleeing from 
ISIS is far outside my context.</p>
<p>So what then? Play the waiting game, and accept that this is not 
happening to us? Well. Lets do <b>something</b> instead. We're Magic players, so let's give up one of our cards.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>So here's my plan. This is four days salary for a Medicine sans frontiers employee working in Syria:</p>
<p><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iF2Vke-Xvzc/VfsiPBhRpAI/AAAAAAAALS0/a9XtKtpgmmk/s1600/DSC_0064.JPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iF2Vke-Xvzc/VfsiPBhRpAI/AAAAAAAALS0/a9XtKtpgmmk/s320/DSC_0064.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>A fetchland could be food for a week. <br/></p>
<p>This
 is a golden time to act.  We all have a couple of cards we don't really need, staples 
sitting in our binders or cards that could be exchanged. If we do this, 
we might actually save a handful of real people from dying. Using our 
hobby and the community for the people in the real underground. </p>
<p>So
I'll sell that Tundra to get some money to give 
to Doctors without borders. Instead of that Tundra, I'll write 
#MtgForLife on a Hallowed Fountain and play that one in my EDH deck 
instead. It's not like I'll ever be sad drawing that one instead of the 
Tundra. Hell, I'll play it with much more pride. Then I'll sell a 
Volcanic Island to buy stamps. Because this is where you come in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For anyone selling, downgrading or just neglecting to
 buy a $25+ card, and giving the money to the #MtgForLife project, I'll 
send you a random 93/94 legal card. I'll sign them and tag the card with
 the project as a memorabilia. If you don't have any card you want to 
downgrade, just neglect to buy one or donate some money for the cause 
anyway, and I'll send you a card. If we get just 10 people to skip a 
blue dual for a basic land or shockland, we'll reach $1000. If we reach 
$1000, I'll throw in another Tundra in the pot. I'll sell my own cards to pay for any stamps needed, at least up to the 
first $200 in postage. In case it would actually go beyond that I reserve the right to use a very small part 
of the funds to fund postage for the perks.<br/></p>
<p>Anything helps. A Thoughtseize to a Duress. A skipped booster draft.</p>
<p>And
 let's make this interesting. If this project should actually reach 
$10,000, I'll use my geek budget for the 
rest of the year to buy a Mox, find someone skilled to give it an 
awesome alteration, and give randomly to someone who donated $100 or 
more. All we need is 100 people giving up a dual or a Tarmogoyf. 10 
people willing to downgrade a Mox from Beta to Unlimited.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>All the money collected will go to Doctors without Borders (MSF). The impact might be small on a global scale, but there will be an impact. We might save someone. We might influence other subcultures to join in and contribute in their way. At the very least we'll do <b>something</b>. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word.

  What We Need & What You Get 
So here's my plan. This is four days salary for a Medicine sans frontiers employee working in Syria:

A fetchland could be food for a week. 
This
 is a golden time to act.  We all have a couple of cards we don't really need, staples 
sitting in our binders or cards that could be exchanged. If we do this, 
we might actually save a handful of real people from dying. Using our

Anything helps. A Thoughtseize to a Duress. A skipped booster draft.
And
 let's make this interesting. If this project should actually reach 
$10,000, I'll use my geek budget for the 
rest of the year to buy a Mox, find someone skilled to give it an

Vida y Esperanza is an equine therapy program for at
risk youth in Cochabamba, Bolivia. According to a study conducted by
Aldeas Infantiles SOS, more than 19,000 children have already, or are at-risk
of losing parental care and finding themselves in the streets in the city of
Cochabamba.

<p>Inspiration for
Hybrid Audio Technologies sprouted as good friends sat in a coffee shop in
Louisville, Kentucky, USA as we shared our collective disenchantment with
the direction that the current high-end car audio speaker manufacturers
were going with their products. At one point the question was posed
‘why don’t you just build the ultimate car audio speaker line and
start your own company?’ So we did. And here we are today,
producing products that are recognized around the world as the finest
car audio speakers available, at any price.</p>
<p>In our nine year tenure, Hybrid Audio has amassed a long list of accolades from the media,
dealers, and enthusiastic consumers that use and enjoy our products. And
then there are organized sound quality competition results - the ultimate
“litmus test” of a products efficacy against its competitors; cars
equipped with Hybrid Audio Technologies products have won more North
American and World Championships in the past seven years than all other
front-stage speaker manufacturers combined. In fact, the
highest-scoring sound quality competition vehicle of all time, in any
format, in any part of the world is Scott Buwalda's (company founder) own
personal show car which, naturally, utilizes Hybrid Audio Technologies
products.</p>
<p>In short, our
philosophy is to build products that are new and exciting, that have no
equal, and are surpassed only by our commitment to honest-to-goodness
customer service and guaranteed lifetime value.</p>
<p>Now that we have
achieved the success we set out for in the high-end speaker marketplace,
we now direct our attention to the high-end mobile audio
amplifier marketplace.</p>
<p><b>Summary
of Contribution</b></p>
<p>The goal of the
Hybrid Audio Technologies amplifier program is to design and manufacture a new
series of super high-end amplifiers to augment the Legatia LE speaker line
from Hybrid Audio Technologies. At the cornerstone of the program, we will endeavor
to create a product that will be recognized around the world as the
finest mobile audio amplifiers available at any price, and to set the new
benchmark for performance in this category.  This goal will
be accomplished by employing both timeless and modern, cutting-edge
techniques in amplifier design to ensure class-leading signal to noise
ratio, stereo separation, power output, and discrete,
tonally-neutral operation, in an aesthetically-pleasing package.</p>
<p>All design work is
currently underway by a core group of two principal engineers, with a combined
50 years’ experience in 12-volt audio amplification.  Hybrid Audio
Technologies has been actively working on the designs since October 2014.
 The two designers of the project, whose names are synonymous in
this field for creating mobile audio masterpieces, will be included as
namesakes for credential marketing, perhaps even as a “signature” line-up of
amplifiers.  </p>

<p>Obviously, we
have attracted the interest of our future, and would-be competitors
in this market, so we cannot release product details that would undermine
our product launch (product sketches, dimensions, etc.).  That being said,
here's what we can divulge:</p>

<p><strong>You Can Be Among the First War on the Rocks Members</strong></p>
<p>We are taking our next big step and want you to be a part of it! My name is Ryan Evans. I am the founder and editor-in-chief of <i><a href=""http://warontherocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">War on the Rocks</a></i>, a digital outlet on strategy, defense, and foreign affairs. </p>
<p>I launched War on the Rocks three years ago because we needed a dedicated platform for public discussion featuring experienced, authentic, authoritative voices. Since then, <i>War on the Rocks</i> has become the outlet of choice for people who have served in government, served in the military, worked abroad, and studied conflict and international affairs in depth. Our daily, free content is widely read in the natsec community and beyond. We are making an impact.</p>
<p>The challenge I face now is how to keep delivering the content you love for free while also allowing <i><a href=""http://warontherocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">War on the Rocks</a></i> to sustain itself. To do that, we will soon be launching a low-cost, $5 monthly membership plan. Through my interactions with you, I learned that what you want is more opportunities to interact with experts like the folks who write for us, as well as others who — like you — are passionate about national security. So that’s what this new membership is going to do.</p>
<p>So what are the two new services that will form this premium plan for members of the War on the Rocks tribe?</p>
<p>Every week, I will be hosting a War-Cast: a live webcast with <a href=""http://warontherocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">War on the Rocks</a> experts, for members only. The experts will rotate based on what’s going on in the world. If you are listening live, you can submit questions for us to answer. If you’re busy, you can watch or listen to it later. It’s like our podcast series, but better, more regular, and more exclusive.</p>
<p>The second service is a gated social network called the War Hall using a new tool called <a href=""http://ryver.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ryver</a>.  Those of us in the “natsec” community use different tools to interact. We all get too many emails and the tech is limited.  Twitter is noisy and, for some conversations, too public, and there are too many trolls. Facebook is fine but how often do we want to subject our high school friends to our thoughts on the war against the Islamic State?  This gated forum combines all the upsides of Twitter, Facebook, and e-mail and avoids the downsides.  And your favorite natsec experts, including many of our writers, are already in the War Hall waiting for you.</p>
<p>So why am I holding this two-week Indiegogo campaign? I wanted to give an opportunity to you to be the first-in on this membership. Only a limited number of people can access it this year. If you want to get involved, this is your chance. We will open the War Hall and start the War-Casts for members only shortly after this campaign ends. During the remaining presidential debates, the election, the transition season that follows, and as the new administration comes into office, your favorite experts on national security will be there providing real time analysis and interacting with members directly on the issues you care about. Our weekly War-Casts will keep you up to date on what you need to know as a member of the national security community. </p>
<p>If you want the benefits of this membership starting in October, sign up now by donating to this campaign. If instead you are happy to wait until the membership is available to everyone in January, but you want a discounted rate, you can also pre-register for that here. The different perks of this campaign are explained on this page.</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity for those of you who are <a href=""http://warontherocks.com/wotr-founders-club/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">passionate about <i>War on the Rocks</i></a> to show us a little love. Please consider giving above and beyond what just a membership costs. Keeping <i><a href=""http://warontherocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">War on the Rocks</a></i> content free has been hard. It’s also been worth it, but it’s been possible only through <a href=""http://warontherocks.com/wotr-founders-club/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">your generosity</a>. I am hoping we can tap into that generous spirit again.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading <i>War on the Rocks</i> and enjoy what comes next!</p>
<p><strong><i>NOTE: Make sure you select which perk you want.</i></strong></p>

To do that, we will soon be launching a low-cost, $5 monthly membership plan. Through my interactions with you, I learned that what you want is more opportunities to interact with experts like the folks who write for us, as well as others who — like you — are passionate about national security. So that’s what this new membership is going to do.
So what are the two new services that will form this premium plan for members of the War on the Rocks tribe?
Every week, I will be hosting a War-Cast: a live webcast with War on the Rocks experts, for members only. The experts will rotate based on what’s going on in the world. If you are listening live, you can submit questions for us to answer. If you’re busy, you can watch or listen to it later. It’s like our podcast series, but better, more regular, and more exclusive.
The second service is a gated social network called the War Hall using a new tool called Ryver.  Those of us in the “natsec” community use different tools to interact. We all get too many emails and the tech is limited.  Twitter is noisy and, for some conversations, too public, and there are too many trolls. Facebook is fine but how often do we want to subject our high school friends to our thoughts on the war against the Islamic State?  This gated forum combines all the upsides of Twitter, Facebook, and e-mail and avoids the downsides.  And your favorite natsec experts, including many of our writers, are already in the War Hall waiting for you.
So why am I holding this two-week Indiegogo campaign? I wanted to give an opportunity to you to be the first-in on this membership. Only a limited number of people can access it this year. If you want to get involved, this is your chance. We will open the War Hall and start the War-Casts for members only shortly after this campaign ends. During the remaining presidential debates, the election, the transition season that follows, and as the new administration comes into office, your favorite experts on national security will be there providing real time analysis and interacting with members directly on the issues you care about. Our weekly War-Casts will keep you up to date on what you need to know as a member of the national security community. 
If you want the benefits of this membership starting in October, sign up now by donating to this campaign. If instead you are happy to wait until the membership is available to everyone in January, but you want a discounted rate, you can also pre-register for that here. The different perks of this campaign are explained on this page.
This is also an opportunity for those of you who are passionate about War on the Rocks to show us a little love. Please consider giving above and beyond what just a membership costs. Keeping War on the Rocks content free has been hard. It’s also been worth it, but it’s been possible only through your generosity. I am hoping we can tap into that generous spirit again.
Thanks for reading War on the Rocks and enjoy what comes next!
NOTE: Make sure you select which perk you want.

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order tor restore  Chris’ Bakery with your favorite baked items will require plenty of dough. We need a substantial down payment by November 30, 2016.</p>
<p>There are several considerations of why we want to purchase this location for Chris’ Bakery.</p>
<p>1. No lease, means never to have to move the heavy equipment</p>
<p>2. No increase of lease</p>
<p>3. Building has 4 tenants that help pay the mortgage. Each have agreed to a new lease.</p>
<p>4. No parking issue</p>
<p>5. Location, location, location</p>
<p>Financial Considerations.</p>
<p>Currently there are 4 businesses in the building that generate $6300 monthly. Two want to expand into space we do not need. That will provide an additional $2,200 per month. Now that will provide Chris' Bakery a space for no cost. The projected loan for the building on $650000 is approximately $5200. That is after a down payment of over $200000.</p>
<p>Considering the cost of equipment to start a modern bakery is over $125000, we have a long way to go. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> Hans K. Christensen (Chris) started Chris’ Bakery over 50 years ago and it grew to be a special place for the community. Chris and Betty treated their customers like family and we plan to continue that tradition. With the help of our experience of baking and decorating cakes we will be following in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Chris' Bakery operated in Seattle from 1948 to 1968, then in Oak Harbor from 1968 to 1998. Now we want to open in 2017 and be open for many more years with the second and third generation bringing you high quality artisan baked goods. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is actually acquiring the building as an investment property. Nothing better than operating a business without a high lease payment. The more money we have as a down payment, the more favorable the bank will see this as a good risk.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Michael Hagedorn, and I'm writing on behalf of the '<b>Villagers</b>', as we call ourselves, here in Portland Oregon, USA, a city that is known for a lot of grassroots ventures including the <b>Portland Bonsai Village</b>... a hopeful gang of highly trained bonsai artists trying to share their art with the world.</p>
<p>Several of us studied bonsai in Japan as apprentices, and all together we put in something like 16 billion years (actually just 16 years, but that's still a rather large number) over there training under masters. In all there are nearly a dozen of us here in Portland doing various things related to bonsai, and several more are going to be joining us soon.</p>
<p><b>See some bonsai-</b> If you don't know much about bonsai, take a minute to look at some:</p>
<p><a href=""http://crataegus.com/portfolio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://crataegus.com/portfolio/</a></p><p>And definitely see our ridiculous video, above, which clearly proves we're not actors posing as bonsai artists. The outtakes / bloopers are maybe the best part, though, and you can see that in the Gallery...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>How does this help?</h3>
<p>The <b>Villagers</b> would like to share the beautiful art of bonsai with you. Your contribution will help in promoting bonsai outside of Japan. <i>By helping us form the Portland Bonsai Village, you’re essentially making a huge contribution to education, art, a local economy, and the livelihood of nearly a dozen artisans, once our nifty programs are underway.</i></p>
<p>This is a big dream project. I know we are all contributing now to Nepal and other places struck by disaster where money is needed, I did so myself. But we also need other kinds of hope, so please support us, too.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>UPDATE! </b></p><p>We've created a beautiful website with the funds raised by this campaign on Indiegogo, which you can see here:</p><p><a href=""http://www.portlandbonsaivillage.com/#welcome-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.portlandbonsaivillage.com/#welcome-1</a><br/></p>
<p>We're so excited to have such a beautiful online home...our sincerest thanks for all donors! </p><p><b>AND YET ANOTHER UPDATE!</b></p><p>First of all, thank you all for contributing to what is a successful and growing community effort. The campaign has been wildly successful, more than we dreamed possible. And we're now building on that to prove your trust in us.</p><p>Something new:</p><p><strong>The Village Grants.</strong> As our primary and flagship program, the Village Grants assist local bonsai artists to bring their art to the public by funding engaging, educational projects. In January 2016, two of our Villagers, Matt Reel and Bobby Curttright, dreamed up a display show as an educational event, and will be receiving a Village Grant to assist them in their endeavors.</p><p>We are essentially a non-profit, and with very low administrative costs (annual website hosting and accounting) <strong>almost all of your current donations will go to fund educational programs.</strong> Thank you all for making this vision a reality. It is now truly that: A bonsai community. And that's a new reality.</p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What will we do?</b></h3>

<h3>What inspired the Village idea? </h3>
<p><b>The Village</b> was inspired by <b>Omiya Bonsai
Village</b> in Japan. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Omiya’s history is the stuff of legend. Starting in the
early 1920’s about 20 bonsai masters went to Omiya to build their gardens. With
so many bonsai professionals in one place, Japan now had a ‘home’ for bonsai.
Anyone interested in the art knew that they could find a tree or a professional
service in Omiya Bonsai Village. Such a large flow of customers to Omiya brought
in business for everyone, took their work up a notch, and they were able to
develop specialties. Although many of the nurseries are now closed,
some of the most famous ones are still there. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Portland Villagers like Matt
Reel, Ryan Neil, and Michael Hagedorn apprenticed under masters who themselves
studied in Omiya Bonsai Village, and so Portland Villagers are essentially
recreating the situation that nurtured their teachers in forming a new Village
in the United States. We are the 3rd generation from Omiya’s founders, now far
beyond the shores of Japan.</span></p>

Hi, I'm Michael Hagedorn, and I'm writing on behalf of the 'Villagers', as we call ourselves, here in Portland Oregon, USA, a city that is known for a lot of grassroots ventures including the Portland Bonsai Village... a hopeful gang of highly trained bonsai artists trying to share their art with the world.
Several of us studied bonsai in Japan as apprentices, and all together we put in something like 16 billion years (actually just 16 years, but that's still a rather large number) over there training under masters. In all there are nearly a dozen of us here in Portland doing various things related to bonsai, and several more are going to be joining us soon.
See some bonsai- If you don't know much about bonsai, take a minute to look at some:
http://crataegus.com/portfolio/And definitely see our ridiculous video, above, which clearly proves we're not actors posing as bonsai artists. The outtakes / bloopers are maybe the best part, though, and you can see that in the Gallery...

How does this help?
The Villagers would like to share the beautiful art of bonsai with you. Your contribution will help in promoting bonsai outside of Japan. By helping us form the Portland Bonsai Village, you’re essentially making a huge contribution to education, art, a local economy, and the livelihood of nearly a dozen artisans, once our nifty programs are underway.
This is a big dream project. I know we are all contributing now to Nepal and other places struck by disaster where money is needed, I did so myself. But we also need other kinds of hope, so please support us, too.UPDATE! We've created a beautiful website with the funds raised by this campaign on Indiegogo, which you can see here:http://www.portlandbonsaivillage.com/#welcome-1
We're so excited to have such a beautiful online home...our sincerest thanks for all donors! AND YET ANOTHER UPDATE!First of all, thank you all for contributing to what is a successful and growing community effort. The campaign has been wildly successful, more than we dreamed possible. And we're now building on that to prove your trust in us.Something new:The Village Grants. As our primary and flagship program, the Village Grants assist local bonsai artists to bring their art to the public by funding engaging, educational projects. In January 2016, two of our Villagers, Matt Reel and Bobby Curttright, dreamed up a display show as an educational event, and will be receiving a Village Grant to assist them in their endeavors.We are essentially a non-profit, and with very low administrative costs (annual website hosting and accounting) almost all of your current donations will go to fund educational programs. Thank you all for making this vision a reality. It is now truly that: A bonsai community. And that's a new reality.
What will we do?

Along with our flagship program, the Village Grants, which are offered to Villagers who have dreamed up engaging, educational programs, here are things we'd like to offer in the future:



The Village Campus: Our ‘Bonsai Flight’, or sampler, as it were. Our doors open during the Campus in intensive mini-classes. Sample our various teachers and learn the art of bonsai~


The Village Co-Op: Products around the Village will be offered for sale at the Co-Op: Bonsai, pots, stands, tools, and everything else of the art ~


Village Dormitory: Our long-term goal of a dwelling in Portland where students, be they long-term apprentices or short-term students, may stay while they study with Villagers. Maybe that will be you!


Village Elementary: The Village brings bonsai into classrooms like Head Start to nurture the seed of beauty and responsibility in youth ~


Village Tours: Private and semi-private tours are offered to the nurseries and studios of Villagers to see them at work. We've already run a few, and they were a smash hit!



Can we do this?

Although we're quite a friendly mob of people, we're also pretty serious about what we do...check out a few of our websites:

reelbonsai.wordpress.com

I've also been writing about the Village for a while on my blog:

http://crataegus.com/2013/07/31/scenes-from-the-very-first-portland-bonsai-village-tour/
…and here's one of my wonky earlier posts about the Village, if you need a laugh today:
http://crataegus.com/2012/11/06/portland-bonsai-village-gets-on-the-design-board/


What inspired the Village idea? 
The Village was inspired by Omiya Bonsai
Village in Japan. Omiya’s history is the stuff of legend. Starting in the
early 1920’s about 20 bonsai masters went to Omiya to build their gardens. With
so many bonsai professionals in one place, Japan now had a ‘home’ for bonsai.
Anyone interested in the art knew that they could find a tree or a professional
service in Omiya Bonsai Village. Such a large flow of customers to Omiya brought
in business for everyone, took their work up a notch, and they were able to
develop specialties. Although many of the nurseries are now closed,
some of the most famous ones are still there. Portland Villagers like Matt
Reel, Ryan Neil, and Michael Hagedorn apprenticed under masters who themselves
studied in Omiya Bonsai Village, and so Portland Villagers are essentially
recreating the situation that nurtured their teachers in forming a new Village
in the United States. We are the 3rd generation from Omiya’s founders, now far
beyond the shores of Japan.



What do we need?

A short stint in culinary school and a creperie opening in Hollywood later, he moved back to northern California, where he honed his skills as a chef and operator in several restaurants throughout the Bay Area. In 2010, he returned to his Napa Valley roots to open Oenotri, a southern-Italian restaurant with a daily-changing menu. Driven by a passion for handcrafted food and showcasing the freshest local ingredients, Tyler continues to expand his role in the community by managing a four acre culinary garden which grows most of the produce for Oenotri. 
                                                    
Lauren Duncan
Lauren Duncan grew up in the Bay Area, where she found her passion for hospitality early, working childhood
 summers at the register of a family-owned neighborhood yogurt store and
 coffee shop. After attending the 
University of California, Santa Barbara, she returned to the restaurant 
business, working as Director of Public Relations and event coordinator 
for the local Harbor Restaurant group, bringing her into contact with 
every aspect of the guest experience. Upon returning to the San Francisco Bay Area, Lauren helped to open a
 variety of restaurants and bars in San Francisco proper and the East Bay, 
furthering honing her skills in developing outstanding service and great
 guest experiences. In 2010 she contributed her extensive experience to 
the opening of Oenotri where she currently is both General Manager as 
well as co-owner with husband Tyler Rodde.


                                       
Matt Cromwell


Matt Cromwell was born and raised in Napa, and has worked at Silverado Brewing Company and Napa Smith Brewery within the Napa Valley. He graduated from the brewing program at the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and loves experimenting with beers, exploring new interpretations of traditional styles and interesting ways to use the best local products available. Matt's goal has always been to bring the taste of the great beer cultures of Belgium, Germany, and Ireland to downtown and to elevate Napa beer to its rightful place alongside the valley's wine culture.

<h3>Every business needs to sell something... Not everyone knows how to do it.</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p><b>PromoUrbe</b> it's the new ""red line"" to your costumers, giving you the opportunity to connect with them directly, get to know their habits and most important, give you all the tools you need to achieve your sales goals and increase your market day by day. What do we mean with ""<i>directly</i>""? Simple, you need to communicate something to your base costumers (hot promotion, brand new product, a 30 min discount... whatever you need!), then you go to your <b>PromoUrbe</b> Admin Panel, write  down the message and add some art and that's it! In less than 5 minutes all of them will get your promotion right in their pockets! </p>
<p>But wait.... that's not totally new... right? Well, the fact that <b>PromoUrbe</b> <i>NEVER</i> expose or compromises any personal data of the users (like any Fanpage on Facebook or WhatsApp) makes a HUGE difference for them and brings a totally new perspective to this scheme.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With the actual tools and methods, <b>small companies</b> are losing a lot of money and resources while trying to communicate any news to their clients, contact with them or advertise new products or hot promotions. Besides than the fact that promoting on Facebook or by chats doesn't work as fast or massive as you could wish.</p>

<p><b>The Problem</b>: 6.7 million Opportunity Youth equals much more than 6.7 million in unrealized hopes, lost opportunities, and billions in increased costs.

<p>Opportunity Youth  are individuals between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither in school nor working. In the United States, there is estimated to be 6.7 million Opportunity Youth; that’s nearly 20% of all individuals ages 16 to 24. Over 60% of youth crime is attributed to Opportunity Youth, which perpetuates increased spending on incarceration and victim services instead of needed education and job training.  </p>
<p>While re-engaging Opportunity Youth is not without its challenges, there is tremendous opportunity. This population represents the chance to develop talent at a time when America faces a significant skills gap. According to a 2011 study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, 64% of American companies cannot find suitable talent to fill open positions, and we're not just talking about a shortage of computer engineers but welders, nutritionists, and nurse's aids are among the top positions in demand to name a few. In addition to this skills gap and the moral dilemma of significant numbers of the youth population being unable to realize their full potential, there are significant costs associated with failing to address increasing rates of disengagement. In 2011 alone, lost revenues from a lack of productive workers and increased social services cost taxpayers $93 billion. </p>
<p>While some view these youth as lost causes, a recent study conducted by the Civic Enterprises and America’s Promise Alliance confirmed many Opportunity Youth remain optimistic about their futures and have concrete goals. 77% of Opportunity Youth believe their future is their own responsibility and success depends on their own efforts. 75% are confident they will eventually be able to achieve their life goals. In other words, these are not hopeless cases.</p>
<p><b>The Solution</b>: Numerous studies outline macro issues from the growing class divide to shifts in social mobility to the growing income gap, but what do these challenges look like to those that are facing them the most, and how can we address these challenges in real-time for the rising generation of America’s workforce? The answer is through the examples of those successfully on the path to re-engagement.</p>
<p>Through the Millennial Train Project, I will be interviewing and profiling Opportunity Youth on track to reconnect with education, work and civic life.

 but without the familial or community connections and support that most
 generational farmers have, we have had to build that trust and 
community from scratch. We hope to use our farm and our experiences to educate and build community for others who want to farm, and help mentor them as others have mentored us.<br/><br/>We operate the farm profitably each year without compromising the principles
 that led us to Permaculture and regenerative farming.  Along the way we
 have improved our techniques as we learned, adapting our initial plans 
for an apple orchard to a more regenerative model that incorporates perennial crops, animals, and community outreach. In 2014, Chad completed
 Geoff Lawton's online Permaculture Design Course, along with other 
workshops in preparation for our most recent major commitment to the farm and it's future - in October, Chad left the corporate job he'd worked at for 15 years to focus on the farm full time.</span></span></span></span><br/><br/></p>

<br/>When we moved here in 2009, eleven of our forty acres had been in corn and bean rotation for the last several decades.  The rest is taken up by either water or woods.  For most conventional farmers that's considered a poor use of land, and indeed, that's why the land was being sold.  For us, the water and trees were the major selling points.  The beans had just been harvested and the earth was bare.  We let the native grasses and weeds grow, cutting and allowing them to regrow, and have gradually introduced animal grazing onto the land.  That care shows.  Six years later the pastures are 
now extremely diverse and of good quality, and ripe to begin 
planting the trees that are the next phase of the land restoration.<br/><br/>The money raised here will go directly to planting trees and installing the infrastructure necessary to support them.  Tree plantings of apples, plums, peaches, hazels, 
chestnuts, and mulberries will be interspersed with black locust and other trees 
designed to fix nitrogen and nurse the main tree crops into production at small intervals 
designed to be thinned as necessary.  These trees will be planted along swales running on contour across what are now our main pasture areas.  Fencing will protect the trees from the livestock that will be grazed down the aisles created by these tree lines.  If we are successful, we'll be able to put 1000 trees into the ground.  Every $20 we receive will be able to plant one tree and install the necessary fencing and other infrastructure necessary to care for it long into the future.<br/><br/>These trees will be a cornerstone for showing a future generation of farmers how we can feed the world without destroying it.  Our future projects include building a test garden and classroom/community space, holding workshops, and hosting retreats. We hope our farm can also be an incubator for others' farm dreams and small businesses. Teaching others about Permaculture is our lifelong calling and we hope to be doing it for a long time.  We've begun this outreach already by holding the first meeting of the Central Iowa Permaculture Guild.  <br/><br/>

community from scratch. We hope to use our farm and our experiences to educate and build community for others who want to farm, and help mentor them as others have mentored us.We operate the farm profitably each year without compromising the principles
 that led us to Permaculture and regenerative farming.  Along the way we
 have improved our techniques as we learned, adapting our initial plans 
for an apple orchard to a more regenerative model that incorporates perennial crops, animals, and community outreach. In 2014, Chad completed
 Geoff Lawton's online Permaculture Design Course, along with other 
workshops in preparation for our most recent major commitment to the farm and it's future - in October, Chad left the corporate job he'd worked at for 15 years to focus on the farm full time.

What We're Doing: 


When we moved here in 2009, eleven of our forty acres had been in corn and bean rotation for the last several decades.  The rest is taken up by either water or woods.  For most conventional farmers that's considered a poor use of land, and indeed, that's why the land was being sold.  For us, the water and trees were the major selling points.  The beans had just been harvested and the earth was bare.  We let the native grasses and weeds grow, cutting and allowing them to regrow, and have gradually introduced animal grazing onto the land.  That care shows.  Six years later the pastures are 
now extremely diverse and of good quality, and ripe to begin 
planting the trees that are the next phase of the land restoration.The money raised here will go directly to planting trees and installing the infrastructure necessary to support them.  Tree plantings of apples, plums, peaches, hazels, 
chestnuts, and mulberries will be interspersed with black locust and other trees 
designed to fix nitrogen and nurse the main tree crops into production at small intervals 
designed to be thinned as necessary.  These trees will be planted along swales running on contour across what are now our main pasture areas.  Fencing will protect the trees from the livestock that will be grazed down the aisles created by these tree lines.  If we are successful, we'll be able to put 1000 trees into the ground.  Every $20 we receive will be able to plant one tree and install the necessary fencing and other infrastructure necessary to care for it long into the future.These trees will be a cornerstone for showing a future generation of farmers how we can feed the world without destroying it.  Our future projects include building a test garden and classroom/community space, holding workshops, and hosting retreats. We hope our farm can also be an incubator for others' farm dreams and small businesses. Teaching others about Permaculture is our lifelong calling and we hope to be doing it for a long time.  We've begun this outreach already by holding the first meeting of the Central Iowa Permaculture Guild.  
  Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute dollars, your voice and support is critical to our project and to educating about Permaculture and resilient agriculture.  Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Puzzlebox Art Studio is a social enterprise created by Youth Connect,
 a vocational training program for young Burmese migrants in Mae 
Sot, Thailand. The studio began here on the Thai-Burma border in mid-2011 to help design the Picturebook Guesthouse—another Youth Connect social enterprise—with professional Thai, Burmese, and American artists hired to train apprentices. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1097785/files/20141215093506-garden_tables_600x419.jpg?1418664906"" src="""" style=""""/><i>Picturebook Guesthouse</i></p>
<i></i><p>For the full first year, students studied art daily, and worked with the professionals to design curtains, tiles, headboards, and bed runners for the guesthouse. <b>After Picturebook opened in April 2012</b>, Puzzlebox Art 
Studio became a standalone business, producing high-quality, quirky handmade products.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1097795/files/20141215093844-owls.jpg?1418665124"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Puzzlebox not only teaches art skills, but also provides an atmosphere where young people learn life skills, develop critical thinking, and gain self-assurance. When they're ready to move on, we're confident that we've been a factor in their evolution, but of course are sorry to lose them. That leads to lack of continuity between staff artists, so two years ago we raised funds through Indiegogo to keep the teaching artists around longer than originally envisioned. <br/><br/>
<p>The Thai teacher <b>Komol Kongcharoen</b> left in May 2013, and the Burmese teacher <b>Sein Sein Lin</b> left in January 2014. The young artists now learn from each other, with additional art &amp; English training supplied by manager <b>Bobo</b>. Our product design &amp; quailty has reached new heights in the last year. But on the downside, our savings have run <b>dangerously low</b>. We desperately need your help to keep this one-of-a-kind business going.<br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get <br/>
</h3>We do our best to run the business on sales profits, but Mae Sot is a small town without many tourists, and the web business has been slow to build. Puzzlebox had no products to sell until mid-2012. We broke even in both 2013 and 2014, which is considered solid growth. Please help this growth continue as we reach out to more retail outlets and increase production<b> </b>throughout 2015.<b><br/></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1097800/files/20141215094149-novica.jpg?1418665309"" src="""" style=""""/><i>Our products at <a href=""http://www.novica.com/artistdetail/?faid=9157"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NOVICA.com</a></i><br/></p>We currently don't contact potential retailers as much as we should, nor do we promote our webshop as much as we should. This is because at our current level of production, we can't always keep up with orders, but we also can't increase production without more money. We're stuck.<b><br/><br/>Some example costs:<br/></b><ul>
<li>
<b>$25</b> - average monthly expense for batik materials, including dye, wax, and fabrics.</li>
<li>
<b>$50</b> - average monthly expense for ceramics materials, including clay, glaze, underglaze, gas for the kiln.</li>
<li>
<b>$150</b> - typical staff artist salary. This is considered fair for Mae Sot, but we'd love to improve it if possible. Artists work 5 days per week, with 24 days paid leave + 6 days sick leave, AND Thai holidays. We currently have 6 staff artists plus the manager. We'd like to hire more people <b>AND</b> raise salaries.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$170</b> - monthly rent. Unlike many small artisan producers, Puzzlebox is not family-run, nor can our work be done from home. Our staff artists collaborate, bounce ideas off each other, teach each other, all in an open-air studio with a big garden. We have a shop on the premises, and also conduct art workshops.</li>
</ul>
In addition, the ever-changing rules of Thai immigration means we're not sure what the next round of visas/work permits will cost for our staff.<br/><br/><b>PERKS:</b> Let's be honest. We wouldn't be running this campaign if 
we could cover super-fancy incentives! Take a look at the smiles in our video, 
and consider that donating to an organization that provides fair-wage 
work in a relaxed, safe environment to bright young 
Burmese migrants may be reward in and of itself.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How does art improve migrant livelihoods?<br/>
</h3>Our current relationship with Youth Connect is informal. We partner with YC to train interns, give presentations, and short workshops for the ""Stay in School"" program.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1097852/files/20141215095607-sisworkshops.jpg?1418666167"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We hire apprentices from Youth Connect just like many business in Mae Sot do, but we also strive to teach the staff how to better themselves, not to simply be painting machines. Youth Connect has a proven record of developing solid workers and community leaders, and we're proud of our links.<br/><br/>More than 20 apprentices and staff have passed through in the last 3 years. Some have started to run businesses themselves, some are teachers, some are translators. One of the featured artists in the video,<b> John Khai</b>, has worked with us for two years and will be leaving in 2015 to finally attend university. We're so excited for him, while at the same time, it's very difficult to lose someone of his caliber. Once again, we'll need money &amp; time for training replacements.<br/><p></p>

</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Life in Mae Sot can be volatile, and people randomly drift back and forth across the border. We can never be 100% certain that someone that we've poured time &amp; money into training is going to stay on long-term. Having a safety net in our bank account buys us time, with which we can carefully consider our hiring choices. We want youths with the most potential and enthusiasm for building up Puzzlebox.<br/><br/>Two years ago, our campaign asked for a mere $4000. About $1000 was spent on an office computer, a sewing machine, and a serger. The remaining $3000 supplemented our sales for the last two years. We're not a charity, we're a business, and your donation would be considered an investment rather than a handout. Puzzlebox is now completely Burmese-run, and a new infusion of funds will last a long time.<br/><br/>

For the full first year, students studied art daily, and worked with the professionals to design curtains, tiles, headboards, and bed runners for the guesthouse. After Picturebook opened in April 2012, Puzzlebox Art 
Studio became a standalone business, producing high-quality, quirky handmade products.

Puzzlebox not only teaches art skills, but also provides an atmosphere where young people learn life skills, develop critical thinking, and gain self-assurance. When they're ready to move on, we're confident that we've been a factor in their evolution, but of course are sorry to lose them. That leads to lack of continuity between staff artists, so two years ago we raised funds through Indiegogo to keep the teaching artists around longer than originally envisioned. 
The Thai teacher Komol Kongcharoen left in May 2013, and the Burmese teacher Sein Sein Lin left in January 2014. The young artists now learn from each other, with additional art & English training supplied by manager Bobo. Our product design & quailty has reached new heights in the last year. But on the downside, our savings have run dangerously low. We desperately need your help to keep this one-of-a-kind business going.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We do our best to run the business on sales profits, but Mae Sot is a small town without many tourists, and the web business has been slow to build. Puzzlebox had no products to sell until mid-2012. We broke even in both 2013 and 2014, which is considered solid growth. Please help this growth continue as we reach out to more retail outlets and increase production throughout 2015.Our products at NOVICA.comWe currently don't contact potential retailers as much as we should, nor do we promote our webshop as much as we should. This is because at our current level of production, we can't always keep up with orders, but we also can't increase production without more money. We're stuck.Some example costs:

$25 - average monthly expense for batik materials, including dye, wax, and fabrics.

$50 - average monthly expense for ceramics materials, including clay, glaze, underglaze, gas for the kiln.

$150 - typical staff artist salary. This is considered fair for Mae Sot, but we'd love to improve it if possible. Artists work 5 days per week, with 24 days paid leave + 6 days sick leave, AND Thai holidays. We currently have 6 staff artists plus the manager. We'd like to hire more people AND raise salaries.


$170 - monthly rent. Unlike many small artisan producers, Puzzlebox is not family-run, nor can our work be done from home. Our staff artists collaborate, bounce ideas off each other, teach each other, all in an open-air studio with a big garden. We have a shop on the premises, and also conduct art workshops.

In addition, the ever-changing rules of Thai immigration means we're not sure what the next round of visas/work permits will cost for our staff.PERKS: Let's be honest. We wouldn't be running this campaign if 
we could cover super-fancy incentives! Take a look at the smiles in our video, 
and consider that donating to an organization that provides fair-wage 
work in a relaxed, safe environment to bright young 
Burmese migrants may be reward in and of itself.
  
How does art improve migrant livelihoods?
Our current relationship with Youth Connect is informal. We partner with YC to train interns, give presentations, and short workshops for the ""Stay in School"" program.We hire apprentices from Youth Connect just like many business in Mae Sot do, but we also strive to teach the staff how to better themselves, not to simply be painting machines. Youth Connect has a proven record of developing solid workers and community leaders, and we're proud of our links.More than 20 apprentices and staff have passed through in the last 3 years. Some have started to run businesses themselves, some are teachers, some are translators. One of the featured artists in the video, John Khai, has worked with us for two years and will be leaving in 2015 to finally attend university. We're so excited for him, while at the same time, it's very difficult to lose someone of his caliber. Once again, we'll need money & time for training replacements.


Workshop with Singaporean artist LiLi Tan. Some of these artists have moved on.

  Risks & ChallengesLife in Mae Sot can be volatile, and people randomly drift back and forth across the border. We can never be 100% certain that someone that we've poured time & money into training is going to stay on long-term. Having a safety net in our bank account buys us time, with which we can carefully consider our hiring choices. We want youths with the most potential and enthusiasm for building up Puzzlebox.Two years ago, our campaign asked for a mere $4000. About $1000 was spent on an office computer, a sewing machine, and a serger. The remaining $3000 supplemented our sales for the last two years. We're not a charity, we're a business, and your donation would be considered an investment rather than a handout. Puzzlebox is now completely Burmese-run, and a new infusion of funds will last a long time.

Our primary focus has been advocacy for the educational rights of disabled students in public schools, the education of parents and educators on the various aspects of each disability and requirements of educational law. Many years ago we just provided services for children with ADHD, now we do ALL disabilities, disorders and syndromes that affect the learning of the child or the teen. Find out more at our web site http://www.adhdservices.org/ where you can also download forms, checklists and resources that will assist you in your own advocacy efforts. You can also hear our CEO speaking weekly on special education topics on the Rose Moore Show at www.alltalkradio.net (The Rose Moore Show).


The Impact
We are currently focusing on one individual: Hannah Lowry.
Hannah Lowry is a 13 year old girl living in
Las Vegas, Nevada.  She was first diagnosed with severe aplastic
anemia in April 2008 when she was 9 years old.  Aplastic anemia is a
rare disorder in which a person’s bone marrow fails, resulting in critically
low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  After
her initial diagnosis, Hannah was treated with immunosuppressant therapy for
approximately one year and seemed to have overcome the disorder.  After
nearly 2 years of normal blood levels, her condition returned in early
2011.  Her doctors have decided that her best option for treatment is
a bone marrow transplant.
When Hannah was diagnosed in 2008, all
immediate family members were tested to find a bone marrow donor, but none
matched.  The recommended treatment for aplastic anemia when there are no related-donor matches for
transplant is to undergo immunosuppressant therapy.  Hannah responded quickly to the drug therapy
and was able to produce enough blood cells on her own without requiring
transfusions after about one month of treatment.  She continued to improve over the next year,
eventually returning to normal blood levels on her own without the help of
drugs.  
For nearly 2 years after
stopping the immunosuppressant therapy, Hannah was able to enjoy the normal
life of a child.  She was able to attend
school with her peers, participate in all activities and resume her gymnastics and
tumbling classes.  Since her re-diagnosis
in 2011, her life has changed drastically. 
Due to her increased risk for bleeding and her suppressed immune system,
Hannah has had to restrict or stop virtually all activities and remain at home since
April 2011.
Early in 2011, during a
routine blood check, it was discovered that her blood levels were dropping
below normal levels again.  After several
weeks of monitoring her blood levels, a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were
performed to confirm what was already expected: 
the aplastic anemia had returned. 
Since Hannah has already gone through the immunosuppressant therapy and
has had a recurrence of the disorder, it was recommended that a search be
conducted to find an unrelated bone marrow donor.  Since Nevada does not have a facility that performs
the type of transplant she needs, Hannah was referred to the transplant team at
Loma Linda University Medical Center in California.  Once a donor has been identified, Hannah will
undergo chemotherapy and radiation to prepare her for the bone marrow
transplant.  Since her own immune system
will be completely destroyed, it is expected that she will be confined to the
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for at least 2 months following transplant while
her new immune system is given time to develop. 
After being released from the hospital, Hannah will need to remain in
California for at least another 2 months in order to be near the transplant
center for monitoring several times per week. 
Once Hannah has recovered enough to be monitored by her doctor in Nevada,
she will be allowed to return home to finish recovering.  Throughout the entire recovery process, great
measures must be taken to ensure that she is not exposed to anything that could
make her sick.  Her activities and
environment will be heavily restricted and monitored for at least a year while
her new immune system develops and becomes strong enough to protect her.  
As of June 1, 2011,
Hannah is currently waiting for an unrelated donor match to be confirmed.  It is expected that the transplant process
will begin in late June or early July, 2011. 
In the meantime, Hannah is hospitalized to receive red blood cell and
platelet transfusions about once per week when her levels drop too low.  She has been unable to physically attend
school since April; however, she has been able to attend some of her classes
via video conferencing.  Her goal is to
be well enough by the fall of 2012 to begin high school with her peers.

Where The Profits Go

Everyone asks, ""Where does the money go?"". Understandably so, not a lot of people believe that 100% of the profits goes to the targeted reason, as most (not all) don't give you the break down. Well, this Non-profit company is well known in Nevada for never hoarding a penny of any donation given. So, with no regret or hidden agenda, here is the break down of where your money goes.


Donations made directly to this site:


This website states if we make our goal, it takes 10% of the total profits. My guess is to cover CC processing charges, transfer in back account, advertising, etc etc. Once it hits the ADHD CAS bank account, it is not touched until either 1) the deadlines of July 4th / July 30th OR 2) the goals are met. From there, 100% of the funds goes directly to Hannah's parents to pay for her treatments, medication, housing, transportation, sanitation and sterilization of any place she stays, education, etc. 


Donations coming from the TNT fireworks booth:

TNT was kind enough to provide us with a location, booth, and fireworks at a discounted rate. But there are fees that apply. We purchase the fireworks at 50% and sell them for 100% of its value. Whatever we don't sell we may return to TNT at our purchased price. There are a few items we must rent, and this is where donations of items comes in. Ie.  Renting a trailer to store our fireworks (Required by Fire and Safety laws) will cost about $200. The company it's currently on hold w is willing to give a discount, but hasn't given an estimate until upon return. If I can get someone to let us borrow an enclosed trailer based out of Las Vegas, that expense will go to Hannah Lowry rather than the rental cost. After all is said and done, and those expenses are paid out, 100% of the remaining funds will go to her. 

To view the list of items needed for the TNT fireworks booth please visit (we will update the list as items get donated):
http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=188886017830851

If we don't get these items donated, we will have to take some of the profits from the event and pay the cost. Like all of you, we would rather have these items donated so more money goes to Hannah's treatments. 
 
We do want to make it clear that ADHD CAS will not take a cut of the profits from any event of donation directed to a specific client - being Hannah Lowry. If you would like to donate to ADHD CAS directly, please donate through paypal at https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=SsY-Be2rdvuFMu09obPla2gborTLoSKl5zqiG5sSkpHGFSlB0IRmv6CLPfG&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d422be6d275c375afb284863ba74d6cdc

<p><b>THE
BIG STORY</b></p>
<p>Alexzander Greer is a 12 year old
from Detroit who loves adventure! He attends Old Redford Academy Middle School
where is he is a 4.0 student. He says that being a high achieving student is challenging,
but with the help of his mom and grandmother he overcomes the obstacles. While
maintaining his 4.0 GPA, Alexzander is also a member of his schools debate and
academic games teams and also Boys to Men, a mentoring and life coaching
program. Among his favorite actives is working with the peer mediation program
and ensuring that his peers find safe and responsible ways to handle their
problems in school. <br/><br/>
Alexzander has been asked to travel to China with The People to People Student
Ambassador Program in June of 2014. He feels this is an honor and really shows
that hard work is its own reward. <br/><br/>
The total cost of the trip is $7,000. Alexzander's mother and grandmother have
been working very hard doing fundraisers and outreach to ensure that he has the
needed funds to make this trip. They still need to raise $5,000 to reach their
goal. <br/><br/>
When we met Alexzander at a dinner where he was being given a youth leadership
award and heard about this opportunity for him to travel we reached out to his
mother to see what was needed. It was then we decided to create this page, a way
to reach out to our friends and family to help this young man. <br/><br/>
We know that you don't know him personally, but the opportunity to expose such
a gifted and motivated young person to 17 days of international travel can't be
understated. Your gift will help Alexzander discover new lands, new people and
new ways of doing great things. He will bring that knowledge back with him to
Detroit and continue to impact his peers and community and terrific ways. </p>
<p><b>THE
DETAILS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $5K. The program is priced at
     $7K and that will take care of all of Alexzander's travel expenses
     (flight, hotel, transportation, program materials, etc.). Any additional
     money raised will help with the additional expenses of traveling

BIG STORY
Alexzander Greer is a 12 year old
from Detroit who loves adventure! He attends Old Redford Academy Middle School
where is he is a 4.0 student. He says that being a high achieving student is challenging,
but with the help of his mom and grandmother he overcomes the obstacles. While
maintaining his 4.0 GPA, Alexzander is also a member of his schools debate and
academic games teams and also Boys to Men, a mentoring and life coaching
program. Among his favorite actives is working with the peer mediation program
and ensuring that his peers find safe and responsible ways to handle their
problems in school. 
Alexzander has been asked to travel to China with The People to People Student
Ambassador Program in June of 2014. He feels this is an honor and really shows
that hard work is its own reward. 
The total cost of the trip is $7,000. Alexzander's mother and grandmother have
been working very hard doing fundraisers and outreach to ensure that he has the
needed funds to make this trip. They still need to raise $5,000 to reach their
goal. 
When we met Alexzander at a dinner where he was being given a youth leadership
award and heard about this opportunity for him to travel we reached out to his
mother to see what was needed. It was then we decided to create this page, a way
to reach out to our friends and family to help this young man. 
We know that you don't know him personally, but the opportunity to expose such
a gifted and motivated young person to 17 days of international travel can't be
understated. Your gift will help Alexzander discover new lands, new people and
new ways of doing great things. He will bring that knowledge back with him to
Detroit and continue to impact his peers and community and terrific ways. 
THE
DETAILS

We are looking to raise $5K. The program is priced at
     $7K and that will take care of all of Alexzander's travel expenses
     (flight, hotel, transportation, program materials, etc.). Any additional
     money raised will help with the additional expenses of traveling
     (clothing, luggage, spending money etc.)
Once the campaign has wrapped we will send everyone who donated a follow up email with the final outcomes and a special note from Alexzander.

M7L is a web platform that </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">connects these travelers to locals, turning the locals into Experience vendors and any curious and adventurous traveler into a customer. M7L promotes Experiences with a capital ""E""! That means we want travelers to not only experience travel, but to Experience life as a local with a local. Experiences could be surfing safaris on the remote West Australian coasts, a bike tour in the French Alps, trekking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, wine making classes offered by a traditional wine maker in Burgundy, or a tour of the hottest locations during Design Week in Milan.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">Connecting people directly to each other, M7L allows the unlimited potential of a local community and its traditions to grow into a micro shared economy. Under this economic model, M7L helps a local economy to grow, respecting and encouraging the local traditions, and utilizing available resources - it's locals! With M7L, all the economic resources brought by travelers to an area will remain there, unlike with traditional tourist offerings (e.g. big bus tours), which leave local communities with only a small part of the money spent by travelers.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">For both travelers and Experience vendors, it is free to register and become a member on M7L. Only when an Experience is completed is a small transaction fee applied - similar to other web services in the internet travel industry.</span></p><p><br/></p><span style=""font-size: 36px; line-height: 40px;""><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></span><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">M7L is not only for those who are looking for something to learn, but also for those who have something to offer.

The concept of My7Lives was born. After traveling to Silicon Valley and networking with tech startups, Giovanni understood that it was time to create a business model that could provide like-minded travelers with authentic localized travel experiences. </span></p><p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;""><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">In October 2012, while looking for a partner to help him realize his idea, Giovanni met Gaetan Licci. Gaetan was an IT manager and he loved the idea immediately. After three days of grueling planning - with multicolor pens and post-its galore, a massive sketch board, and several plates of Giovanni's pasta - the idea became a project.</span></p><p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;""><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">In February 2013, a beta prototype was created and a month later, My7Lives Ltd (M7L) was founded in London. Thanks to several testers sharing their user experiences and to insight from friends and relatives, the beta version was enhanced and ready to attract partners to further build out the team. In May 2013, Alfredo De Joannon joined the project bringing new financial resources, another investor, Michele Martinuzzi, and a change in the strategy, moving from a national kick-off to an international scale development with a focus on crowd funding. He also helped the company develop a sustainability philosophy that underscored the importance of developing a dedicated channel of services for non-profit organizations.</span></p><p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;""><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">Thousands of lines of code and some servers in the cloud are now the core of My7Lives. M7L is a multilingual website, still not public, that permits beta users to sign up, manage their user profile, and add/buy Experiences. In order to improve the quality, we are using the best technology available to develop best practices and effective customer experiences. What's under the hood? On the website, we are using open source technologies:</span></p><p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;""></p><ul style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 21px;"">

</div>","MY7LIVES IN PRESS THE PROJECTMy7Lives is a fantastic opportunity for travelers who seek authentic Experiences and for locals to show them a slice of their lives! There are countless people around the world who possess skills and local knowledge that are interesting and valuable to travelers. M7L is a web platform that connects these travelers to locals, turning the locals into Experience vendors and any curious and adventurous traveler into a customer. M7L promotes Experiences with a capital ""E""! That means we want travelers to not only experience travel, but to Experience life as a local with a local. Experiences could be surfing safaris on the remote West Australian coasts, a bike tour in the French Alps, trekking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, wine making classes offered by a traditional wine maker in Burgundy, or a tour of the hottest locations during Design Week in Milan.Connecting people directly to each other, M7L allows the unlimited potential of a local community and its traditions to grow into a micro shared economy. Under this economic model, M7L helps a local economy to grow, respecting and encouraging the local traditions, and utilizing available resources - it's locals! With M7L, all the economic resources brought by travelers to an area will remain there, unlike with traditional tourist offerings (e.g. big bus tours), which leave local communities with only a small part of the money spent by travelers.For both travelers and Experience vendors, it is free to register and become a member on M7L. Only when an Experience is completed is a small transaction fee applied - similar to other web services in the internet travel industry.HOW IT WORKSM7L is not only for those who are looking for something to learn, but also for those who have something to offer. If you would like to share your ""lives"" or Experiences with like-minded people, M7L gives you the opportunity to offer these Experiences without third-party mediation.
 STEP 1:  Join the community as a buyer, seller, or both!
STEP 2:  As a buyer, peruse through the many exciting Experiences that are being offered. Start your journey and live your Experience! Buyers collect points with every new Experience lived and as points are earned, there is an opportunity to become a M7L ambassador. As a seller, create a ""New Experience"", complete the form, and your offer goes live in the M7L community.

STEP 3:  Once the Experience ends, sellers will receive the buyer's payment (minus a 4% M7L administration fee). Both the buyers and sellers can rate the experience. 


STEP 4:  Share your Experience with everyone - with the community and on social media.

SUMMARY OPERATIONFeesAre you a seller?You can post your offers FREE OF CHARGE.48 hours following the end of the Experinece, the amount paid by the buyer (less 4% administration fee) will be credited into your PayPal account or bank account.For example: BOAT TRIP price: $25.00

4% administration fee = $1.00


Amount credited to your account = $24.00

Are you a buyer?Purchasing an Experience includes the Experience price plus a 10% administration fee.For example:BOAT TRIP price: $25.00

10% administration fee = $2.50


Total cost = $27.50

Want to sell?It takes just a few clicks.

CLICK on “+ New experience”.


COMPLETE the form using the ""guided insertion"".


WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION. We will notify you when the Experience offer goes live.

Want to buy?It takes just a few clicks.

SEARCH for the Experience you like.


CONTACT the seller to arrange specific details (i.e. time and place).


BOOK the Experience (by booking you confirm the Experience and payment is required).

THE ORIGINGiovanni Dell'Acqua, avid enthusiast of travel and adventure, felt that he was missing something to make his trips around the world incredible! The concept of My7Lives was born. After traveling to Silicon Valley and networking with tech startups, Giovanni understood that it was time to create a business model that could provide like-minded travelers with authentic localized travel experiences. In October 2012, while looking for a partner to help him realize his idea, Giovanni met Gaetan Licci. Gaetan was an IT manager and he loved the idea immediately. After three days of grueling planning - with multicolor pens and post-its galore, a massive sketch board, and several plates of Giovanni's pasta - the idea became a project.In February 2013, a beta prototype was created and a month later, My7Lives Ltd (M7L) was founded in London. Thanks to several testers sharing their user experiences and to insight from friends and relatives, the beta version was enhanced and ready to attract partners to further build out the team. In May 2013, Alfredo De Joannon joined the project bringing new financial resources, another investor, Michele Martinuzzi, and a change in the strategy, moving from a national kick-off to an international scale development with a focus on crowd funding. He also helped the company develop a sustainability philosophy that underscored the importance of developing a dedicated channel of services for non-profit organizations.Thousands of lines of code and some servers in the cloud are now the core of My7Lives. M7L is a multilingual website, still not public, that permits beta users to sign up, manage their user profile, and add/buy Experiences. In order to improve the quality, we are using the best technology available to develop best practices and effective customer experiences. What's under the hood? On the website, we are using open source technologies:
Linux 
Mysql
Solr
Grails framework
Tomcat application server
Apache web-tier
Bootstrap template with jquery
and backbone.js
While we have done a lot of work there are still a lot of features that have to be developed in order to create an optimal user experience.Below is a list of what we have completed as well as our roadmap for what is planned for the future.ROAD MAPPERKS SUMMARYIn exchange, we are offering :

There are many things they love about the beautiful city but if you asked them to name one thing it would be the great variety of delicious foods that LA offers. Like many people in Los Angeles they LOVE to eat out and try dishes from different countries. Their latest ""addiction"" has been exploring the food truck scene in LA. Jessanne and Farhad describe food trucks as an exciting new way of exploring traditional and innovative food with the convenience of fast service.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Last year the couple went to visit Amsterdam, where Farhad grew up and he introduced her to two famous local sweets called Stroop Waffles (pronounced ""Strope"" Waffles, which are caramel Waffles).

Unfortunately, fresh Stroop Waffles and Poffertjes are almost impossible to get in the US so the couple decided to do something about this.</span></p><h3>Sweet Amsterdam Food Trailer</h3><p>The couple want the people of Los Angeles to have access to authentic fresh Dutch Stroop Waffles and Poffertjes and the best way <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to do this is of course </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">with a food trailer.

There are many things they love about the beautiful city but if you asked them to name one thing it would be the great variety of delicious foods that LA offers. Like many people in Los Angeles they LOVE to eat out and try dishes from different countries. Their latest ""addiction"" has been exploring the food truck scene in LA. Jessanne and Farhad describe food trucks as an exciting new way of exploring traditional and innovative food with the convenience of fast service.Last year the couple went to visit Amsterdam, where Farhad grew up and he introduced her to two famous local sweets called Stroop Waffles (pronounced ""Strope"" Waffles, which are caramel Waffles). And Poffertjes (pronounced ""pufferchess""), which are warm fluffy mini pancakes topped with butter and powdered sugar.                      Stroop Waffles                                                    Poffertjes    Jessanne fell in love with these sweets and the couple decided to buy some for their friends and family in the US to try out. Everyone agreed that it tasted unlike anything they have ever had before and wanted to know where to get them. Unfortunately, fresh Stroop Waffles and Poffertjes are almost impossible to get in the US so the couple decided to do something about this.Sweet Amsterdam Food TrailerThe couple want the people of Los Angeles to have access to authentic fresh Dutch Stroop Waffles and Poffertjes and the best way to do this is of course with a food trailer.

Being invited to represent mid Missouri at Slow Food's Terra Madre and Salone 
del Gusto conference in Italy is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We will meet, eat and engage with people from throughout the world who are passionate about and
 committed to sustainable agriculture, cultural preservation and food 
with integrity. All the delegates, from more than 100 countries, will be there to represent the very best of what their countries' food systems have to offer. This is not only an honor for the three of us, but an 
opportunity for others to learn about mid Missouri through the 
connections we make and the lessons we share with fellow delegates. Upon return to Columbia, we'll be happy to pass along newly gained knowledge through community conversations and application of the best practices encountered.Who are we?The

<h3>A Little Introduction.</h3>
<p>First lets give you a little bit of information about us!</p>
<p>Rhys Watkins &amp; Adam Edinborough are the beer loving duo who grew the Cardiff born &amp; bred Crafty Devil Brewery from a humble home-brew shed in their back garden to Untappd's number 1 rated brewery in Wales. And they did this not with big money from huge investors or rich benefactors. They did this by doing things RIGHT. By wearing their love for great beer on their sleeves and putting in some damn hard work.</p>
<p>Chris 'Beardface' Rowlands is a seasoned (and hairy) pub landlord who has worked most of his life trying to change the drinking landscape of Cardiff away from massed produced soulless products chugged down in boring 'cater to the masses' bars to high quality, independent minded pubs that sell great beers that are meant to be enjoyed in a place that puts service and quality first. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So what are we going to do?</h3>
<p>We're going to open BEELZEBUBS! A truly independent pub designed to put great beer, great food and great service on the top of the agenda. It will be Crafty Devil's first City Center Pub but more than that, it will be a beacon of great beer, cider, spirits and wine that we hope will become a haven for the people like us, folks who love pubs and socialising but have become disenfranchised with the depressing state of the modern pub.</p>
<p>This campaign is SO important to us as we've worked, drank and <i>endured </i>countless sub-standard, homogenised bars that are run by people who don't see customers as people to be welcomed, served and appreciated but as walking pound-signs and numbers on a P&amp;L sheets that we just feel VERY strongly that it's time independent businesses retake the high street!</p>
<p>So that's what we plan on doing.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Right now.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How do you come in.</h3>
<p>We've already secured our license, the property and a fantastic team ready to serve you but as we said at the start, we're not the wealthiest folk in town by any means! Although we ARE lucky enough to have a number of independent minded, beer loving folk (like you!) who have kindly invested in us and are helping us make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>What we need now is the last little push to ensure we can decorate and re-furbish the pub to the standards the people of Cardiff deserve! (nobody likes sitting on a cheap, wonky chair!)</p>
<p>Your investment will be used to refurbish our unit on High Street, right opposite Cardiff Castle and help turn it into Cardiff's newest independent public house.</p>
<p>We will be using your investment to source and purchase some epic beers, amazing ciders and some of the best spirits and whiskeys on the planet.</p>
<p>And we will also be using your investment to hire our amazing team that, unlike our competition, will all be paid the true Living Wage, not minimum wage. Why? Because we believe in the living wage foundation and we believe that happy, secure, rewarded staff pour the best beer and give the best service.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are after £15,000 to help finish the final touches to our humble, lovely little pub.</li>
<li>For that we are going to be giving you lovely folks free beer, a discount for life and access to a whole host of other events and occasions we'll be running just for you.</li>
<li>If for any reason we don't get to £15,000 you can rest assured that every penny will still be going towards Beelzebubs! We just might have to wait a month or two to buy the REALLY comfy chairs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact.</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Rest assured, this is not your every day pub or bar. We're Independent, service driven, quality led and HUNGRY! Why? Because we're customers just like you! Cardiff DESERVES more independent businesses and right now High Street is enjoying a huge resurgence of them as the bigger companies stagnate and fail, younger, fresher entrepreneurs and passionate business owners like ourselves snatch the ball and run with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>This project is designed to reward YOU. The socialising, food loving, beer drinking people of Cardiff. You are contributing to your own happiness and helping Cardiff break free of the mass producing doldrums it's found itself in for decades.</li>
<li>This isn't a risk. Crafty Devil has grown year on year and provided Cardiff with some of it's freshest, best beers ever. And Chris Rowlands has set up, ran and grown some of the biggest beer pubs in Cardiff and London successfully year in year out. We know what we're doing. We're just fed up of doing it for millionaires and boards of Directors. We want to do it for YOU.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are the risks and challenges?</h3>
<p>We value Transparency above everything else and we believe if you're going to ask someone to put their money on the line they better know what the risks are.</p>
<p>Like all new businesses, the biggest risk of all is failing in year one and running into bankruptcy. I think we all agree that's a <i>pretty</i> big risk! But we're not afraid of it. We're meeting it head on! Adam &amp; Rhys joined forces with Chris for that very reason. He has a long track record of taking under-performing pubs and turning them into fantastic, successful businesses. From Cardiff to London and back again he's delivered growth and fiscal success wherever he runs.</p>
<p>He knows exactly what he's doing. We all do. We're just fed up of doing it for millionaires and boards of Directors. We want to do it for YOU and the people of Cardiff!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and that's ok! We'd never expect anyone to put themselves into debt on our account. But just because you can't contribute that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about Beelzebubs!</li>
<li>Tell your friends and colleagues who you think will enjoy our new business the most!</li>

major divisions within the St. Louis community.  We mourn the death of Mike Brown and lament the violence, rioting, and mistrust between citizens and law enforcement in the St. Louis Community.  We regret the impact it has had on Ferguson, especially.  Mediated dialogue between citizens and between citizens and law enforcement will be an essential part in rebuilding the trust and relationships necessary for the healing process.  </p><p>If each person that was referred to us in this past year would donate $5, and each person who attended a mediation would donate $10, we would be most of the way toward our goal.  If we were to consider the costs saved, whether they be legal fees, potential investigations, fines, enforcement costs, we would meet our goal many times over.   Mediation saves money, but mediation requires resources.<br/><br/></p><h3>Community Mediation Offers a Peaceable Alternative to Ramped Up Law Enforcement</h3>The goal of community mediation, in all its forms, is to make sure that all parties are heard.  Community Mediation Services of St. Louis has offered mediation between citizens in St. Louis for more than a decade.  We are one of the few community mediation centers to offer both Neighborhood Mediation and Police-Citizen Mediation.  We make it our mission to provide mediation services at no charge to St. Louis residents.  Time and again, we have found that when people feel they have been heard, they are often prepared to set about the work of resolving differences and moving forward.<br/><br/><h2>Community Mediation Services of St. Louis Must Expand to Serve Ferguson, Other Municipalities</h2><p>Although Community Mediation Services is well established in St. Louis, we need more mediators to meet predicted demands.  In order to effectively serve the city of St. Louis, our mediators must look like the population they serve.  We need to expand our volunteer base to include mediators from all over the City of St. Louis and the Metropolitan Area.  <br/><br/>In addition to St. Louis City, we are active in Bellefontaine Neighbors, St. Ann, and Ferguson.  Our goal is to recruit mediators from each of these municipalities.<br/><br/></p><h2>Your Contribution Helps Fund Mediator Training</h2>As part of CMS's efforts to expand services, we are now accepting applications for our next mediation training session, to be held in January and February of 2015.  We place strong emphasis on providing our mediators with the professional training they need to serve as good listeners and conversation facilitators.  Tuition for this next training will be $400 per person.  Because income levels vary throughout the city, we need to help make training affordable to everyone, and to make volunteering possible for more people.  Each $10 contribution will provide 1 hour of training.<br/><br/><h2>Your Contribution Helps People of Lower Income Volunteer</h2><p>We are an entirely volunteer based organization.  Volunteering as a mediator is a privilege dependent on reliable transportation and sufficient resources to offer the time required for mediation.  We recognize that not all good mediator candidates can afford the transportation or time on their own.  It is therefore also our hope to offer stipends to lower income volunteers to help cover transportation and childcare costs.</p><p><br/></p> <p><br/></p></div>","Now is the time for Community Mediation in St. LouisThe events of summer and autumn 2014 have highlighted major divisions within the St. Louis community.

Importance of our Research Project: 
With the right tools,
students can use their college years to prepare for a career that is fulfilling
for them and uses their talents to benefit others. 
We are crowdfunding on
Indiegogo for a $1,000 grant to award to an organization that will implement
all or part of our idea.



At least two of the four organizations we shared our idea
with have expressed a strong interest in looking for ways to implement it
practically. We are middle school students, so we can only pursue this project
for so long, then we have to focus on other things, like Junior High and High
School!
But we feel our idea has real practical value, and your support will help it
happen in our community!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Northeast Oyster Company is an Oyster and Wine bar built from raw space in Mamaroneck,NY 20 miles north east of Manhattan. I am just about ready to open, pending final, sorted inspections. Our focus is serving oysters harvested from all the coastal states from New York to Canada. This campaign will help fund purchasing and operating capital. I have over 25 years experience in the restaurant, oyster/wine bar and retail wine business. Our location and space is small enough to run by myself with one to two servers and big enough to do strong volume, perfect for our business model. It's designed to be a simple, inexpensive start-up. Additionally we installed a great sound system, with a very eclectic music selection, which will set us apart from all our competition. Simply put: great oysters, wine,beer, music and service will clearly make us unique to the area. This is a Social Enterprise prototype and mentoring program where I can help other budding entrepreneurs open their own businesses. Your support will help me help mentor the people who are challenged in getting their ideas off the ground with financing being the biggest roadblock. If I can do this, I can pay it forward to those with big ideas and dreams who have no possibility of getting financed. Your help will, through this medium, allow me to show, mentor and guide those who have thought that this process of raising money is unattainable and unthinkable, is a possibility and achievable. My goals are for this business to spawn another oyster bar first,a wholesale oyster distribution company second, and a wholesale/retail organic produce company using local/regional suppliers third.  Simply put, a small retail space, a walk-in refrigerator and a truck are the major parts needed to get started. These businesses will be created with the intention of developing aspiring entrepreneurs into business owners. I am already working with two potential candidates who want to open their own businesses. </div>

<p>Luis Chirinos and
Kevin McCullough are co-owners of Fitness Urbano and we have collectively lived
in San Francisco for more than three decades. Together we have 20 years of experience operating businesses in the health and fitness industry.  </p>
<p>We know that every
person comes from a different level of fitness with varying skill sets and
conditions and each has unique needs in achieving their specific fitness goals.
Finding a gym that is truly focused on helping and motivating individuals
toward their goals can be challenging. Large chain gyms mostly view their clients
as a monthly membership fee; measuring success by more memberships sold rather
than individual client achievements. And small studios typically need to limit
their focus to a single technique or singular form of workout; not able to
address a client’s overall fitness needs.</p>
<p>At Fitness Urbano’s we
will provide a wide range of services focused on addressing our client’s
specific training needs.  At the core of
our service offerings will be our open layout workout area, designed and
equipped with functional training methods in mind.  This is where independent personal trainers
will develop training programs and provide motivation for our clients, helping
them achieve their fitness goals. At Fitness Urbano we also view our personal
trainers as our clients.  In addition to
providing them with a top notch training facility to host sessions with their
clients, we are dedicated to helping them grow their individual businesses.  We do this by keeping hosting fees low and by
providing no cost referrals and no cost marketing assistance.</p>
<p>Another major
component of Fitness Urbano’s service offerings will include the construction
of a 1500 sq ft group exercise studio. Here our clients will benefit from the
expertise and motivation of our skilled instructors and the support of the
group dynamic. We’ll offer the hottest group exercise classes including Yoga,
Zumba, MMA Conditioning, ViPR and more.</p>
<p>We are a full service
gym also providing monthly gym memberships, massage, complimentary towel
service, brand new locker and shower rooms, complimentary coffee, tea and
organic fruits and above all, a friendly and approachable staff.</p>
<p>A key differentiator
here at Fitness Urbano will be our “No Crowd” policy. We won't oversell our
services so our members won’t be sandwiched into a corner for a class or have
to wait to use fitness equipment.</p>
<p>We are building Fitness

<p>Hej!<br/>
Vi er <i>Vinhanen</i></p>
<p>I
2013 havde vi en drøm om at skabe en vinbar og vinhandel uden fine fornemmelser. Vin til folket! Den drøm gik i opfyldelse, da vi åbnede Vinhanen på
Nørrebro i København.</p>
<p>I
2015 tager vi vores drøm videre til Vesterbro, og vi har brug for din hjælp.</p>
<p></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1408753/files/20150423060742-vinhanenen.jpg?1429794462"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b></b>
<p><b>Vin og kunst til folket</b><br/>Vinhanen
er ikke helt som de andre vinbarer. Vi opbevarer og tapper vores kvalitetsvin
fra store ståltanke i butikken. Vinen, den henter Jacob i Frankrig direkte hos
producenten, før vinbonden tapper den på flasker. På den måde skærer vi et led
af distributionskæden, og prisen på de dejlige dråber kan vi dermed holde helt
i bund. Selve indretningen bærer præg af Julias baggrund i kunstverdenen. På
Vinhanen Nørrebro donerede kunstnerne <b>FOS</b>,
<b>Bjørn Nørgaard</b> og <b>SUPERFLEX</b> de integrerede værker, som
gør stedet helt specielt. Alle møblerne er designet af møbelsnedkeriet <b>Blendwerk</b>. Tilsammen resulterede det i,
at vi modtog Hovedstadens Forskønnelses kunst pris i 2013, hvilket vi er meget
stolte af.
</p><div>

<b>Hjælp os med at åbne Vinhanen Vesterbro<span></span></b><br/>I vores to år på Baggesensgade har vi haft fornøjelsen af at servere vin til en masse dejlige mennesker og lægge hus til et væld af arrangementer. Én ting vi hører igen
og igen, er et ønske om at få en Vinhane i deres del af byen.

</div><p>Nu er vi klar til at tage springet og åbne Vinhanen Vesterbro, sammen med
den nye bestyrer Nicholas Wændelin. Vi er meget taknemmelige for, at vores
dygtige venner, kunstnerne <b>John Kørner</b>,
<b>Lilibeth Cuenca</b> og <b>Bjørn Nørgaard</b>, har tilbudt deres hjælp
og skaber ny integreret kunst til stedet. Resultatet bliver fantastisk, og vi
glæder os til at vise jer det.  </p>
<p>Vinhanen Vesterbro skal ligge på Enghavevej 24. Et dejligt hjørne af
kvarteret, hvor vi også får plads til udeservering. Placeringen er i top, men
meget skal ske, før vi kan slå dørene op og åbne hanerne for gæsterne. Og her
håber vi, at du har lyst til at hjælpe.</p><p></p><p>Pga. lokalernes beskaffenhed 
bliver
vi nødt til at bygge et særligt udviklet anlæg til opbevaring af vinene, hvilket indbefatter et stort kølerum. Det bliver flot og er rigtig godt for 
vinen men koster desværre mange penge. Nærmere bestemt 100.000 kr...</p>
<div>

Vinhanen er en drøm og en mission. Vin er noget vi i fællesskab deler og deles om, i smukke omgivelser og god stemning. Vinen skal ud
til folket. Også på Vesterbro. Og du kan være med til at få det til at
ske! <br/><br/><p><b>Vil du ha’ Vinhanen til Vesterbro? </b><br/>Hver en krone (€) vi kan samle ind i støtte her, skal vi ikke låne til i banken. Så vi håber du har lyst til at bidrage til vores projekt
ved at købe én af vores perks. Vi garanterer, at de kommer mangefold igen. Men det kræver selvfølgelig, at vi når 100% finansiering inden kampagnens udløb. </p>
<b>
</b><p>Uendelig
mange tak for hjælpen!</p>

Julia, Thomas &amp; Nicholas</p>

Hej!
Vi er Vinhanen
I
2013 havde vi en drøm om at skabe en vinbar og vinhandel uden fine fornemmelser. Vin til folket! Den drøm gik i opfyldelse, da vi åbnede Vinhanen på
Nørrebro i København.
I
2015 tager vi vores drøm videre til Vesterbro, og vi har brug for din hjælp.

Vin og kunst til folketVinhanen
er ikke helt som de andre vinbarer. Vi opbevarer og tapper vores kvalitetsvin
fra store ståltanke i butikken. Vinen, den henter Jacob i Frankrig direkte hos
producenten, før vinbonden tapper den på flasker. På den måde skærer vi et led
af distributionskæden, og prisen på de dejlige dråber kan vi dermed holde helt
i bund. Selve indretningen bærer præg af Julias baggrund i kunstverdenen. På
Vinhanen Nørrebro donerede kunstnerne FOS,
Bjørn Nørgaard og SUPERFLEX de integrerede værker, som
gør stedet helt specielt. Alle møblerne er designet af møbelsnedkeriet Blendwerk. Tilsammen resulterede det i,
at vi modtog Hovedstadens Forskønnelses kunst pris i 2013, hvilket vi er meget
stolte af.


Hjælp os med at åbne Vinhanen VesterbroI vores to år på Baggesensgade har vi haft fornøjelsen af at servere vin til en masse dejlige mennesker og lægge hus til et væld af arrangementer. Én ting vi hører igen
og igen, er et ønske om at få en Vinhane i deres del af byen.

Nu er vi klar til at tage springet og åbne Vinhanen Vesterbro, sammen med
den nye bestyrer Nicholas Wændelin. Vi er meget taknemmelige for, at vores
dygtige venner, kunstnerne John Kørner,
Lilibeth Cuenca og Bjørn Nørgaard, har tilbudt deres hjælp
og skaber ny integreret kunst til stedet. Resultatet bliver fantastisk, og vi
glæder os til at vise jer det.  
Vinhanen Vesterbro skal ligge på Enghavevej 24. Et dejligt hjørne af
kvarteret, hvor vi også får plads til udeservering. Placeringen er i top, men
meget skal ske, før vi kan slå dørene op og åbne hanerne for gæsterne. Og her
håber vi, at du har lyst til at hjælpe.Pga. lokalernes beskaffenhed 
bliver
vi nødt til at bygge et særligt udviklet anlæg til opbevaring af vinene, hvilket indbefatter et stort kølerum. Det bliver flot og er rigtig godt for 
vinen men koster desværre mange penge. Nærmere bestemt 100.000 kr...

MEN!
Vinhanen er en drøm og en mission. Vin er noget vi i fællesskab deler og deles om, i smukke omgivelser og god stemning. Vinen skal ud
til folket. Også på Vesterbro. Og du kan være med til at få det til at
ske! Vil du ha’ Vinhanen til Vesterbro? Hver en krone (€) vi kan samle ind i støtte her, skal vi ikke låne til i banken. Så vi håber du har lyst til at bidrage til vores projekt
ved at købe én af vores perks. Vi garanterer, at de kommer mangefold igen. Men det kræver selvfølgelig, at vi når 100% finansiering inden kampagnens udløb. 

Uendelig
mange tak for hjælpen!
Jacob,
Julia, Thomas & Nicholas
P.S.
Kan du li' vores idé? Så vil vi være super taknemmelig, hvis du vil dele dette

They wanted to know what I was up to. 'Is it goin' good? What are you going to do with all these plants?'  I attempted to wipe the sweat from my forehead but only managed to smear dirt across my face as I turned and said, 'this is basil. It is a common herb in cooking cause it is easy to grow and has a great flavor.' I offered them each a leafy stem. The two women appeared to be in their 50's. Grandmothers at least. 'Wow! This stuff is pretty good! What did you say with was?'</p>
<p> 'Basil.' I couldn't believe these women living two blocks away from me, feeding many mouths every night, had never tried fresh basil. I gave them each a bundle of herbs to take home. They beamed and wandered away smiling and talking about starting their own little herb gardens.</p>
<p>That summer, we gave away almost half of what we grew. I discovered the people who lived in the blocks around the garden - an area of town I had been warned to avoid - were curious about the plants and eager to work new items into their families' meals once we presented the greens and a couple recipe ideas. </p>
<p><b>I am creating VegCycle™ to help fill the curiosities and the stomachs of these neighbors with food that will improve their health and their wellbeing. </b></p>

</div>The VegCycle™ campaign will help fund the construction, storage and maintenance of a portable hydroponic growing structure. We want to create a bicycle with a huge tray of plants on the back that are growing in nutrient rich water which is fed by fish that live below the plants. To complete the sustainable growing cycle, the pump that circulates the water between the fish and the plants will be powered by a solar cell.</div><div>

<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">What is exciting about VegCycle™ is that the problem we are tackling is two fold - we are building a space to bring the OTR community together to talk about food, and at the same time we are testing out methodologies for urban farming that we can scale and use to support the growth of this project, and others in the future. Food has always brought people together. I grew up thinking 'food, water, shelter' - that's all you need to live. But now, food - growing it and finding it - is one of the top three challenges facing humans in the 21st century, and health problems like diabetes and obesity are prolific across America. VegCycle™ can bring food into focus. The hilarious looking bike-cart-garden-fishpond contraption will intrigue and attract people on the street in ways a garden or flyer never could. By making the growing pod mobile we are expanding the project's reach beyond Over the Rhine and into other parts of town.

Your contributions will, no matter what, lead to advancements in the conversations around food in our city.</p>
<div><h1>Potential Pitfalls</h1></div>
<div><p>In many ways we are oversimplifying this challenge. We are saying that if we get the right supplies and the funding we need, everything will go perfectly. But of course that isn't true. One of our main goals of the project is to test modern growing tactics out for ourselves, and there is a reason so many researchers and scientists are working to develop new ideas and methods to create food - food is hard to grow!! In many ways, getting the funding to set up the bicycle-pod will be the easiest part because after that we will be challenged to create and moderate the delicate environments in which food-producing plants exist. </p></div>
<p><span>So we are talking to scientists, professors, and farmers. In the months of February and March, Carolyn Jane is taking research on as her full time job. She is traveling around the country talking to the people who specialize in plants. Everyone from community gardeners, dairy farmers, commercial farmers, organic farmers, urban farmers, and professors of agriculture (check out our blog for information about these talks). These people have the insights and the understanding of what it takes to make food, and these are the people whom Carolyn Jane is questioning on her journey. Follow her trip on Instagram at @carolynjanenu and #VegCycleJourney, and please reach out if you know of people who can help answer her questions about how to grow food! </span></p>
<h1>The Team</h1>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">Carolyn Jane, the Chief Growth Officer of VegCycle™ is a Mechanical Engineer who loves simple living and healthy eating. She has been studying entrepreneurship with Venture for America for the past 18months, and is launching her first idea through IndieGoGo. Carolyn Jane is passionate about food. She thinks about how to keep the top soil from eroding, keep fertilizers from leeching into ground water, and keep food food. At the same time she looks around her neighborhood, at the streets littered with chip bags and candy wrappers, and she is concerned for the families growing up within a mile of her who don't know what fresh basil tastes like. Carolyn Jane thinks VegCycle™ might be the first step towards addressing both of these problems in her neighborhood.</p>
<p><span>This project is different for Carolyn Jane, but she is thrilled to begin. In the past she has started gardens, led a team of engineers building a race car, and worked in machine shops. Her work over the past year as a project manager at BTG Labs - a local small business - helped her tune her skills that allow her to bridge the gap between science or engineering and people. Her experience managing (and machining for) Northwestern's Baja SAE team was extremely formative as it showed her for the first time that while she loved engineering, what matters most are the people - and a good company will put people first be those its employees or the surrounding community. Now, she is ready to combine all of those skills to try something bigger. </span></p>

One of our main goals of the project is to test modern growing tactics out for ourselves, and there is a reason so many researchers and scientists are working to develop new ideas and methods to create food - food is hard to grow!! In many ways, getting the funding to set up the bicycle-pod will be the easiest part because after that we will be challenged to create and moderate the delicate environments in which food-producing plants exist. 
So we are talking to scientists, professors, and farmers. In the months of February and March, Carolyn Jane is taking research on as her full time job. She is traveling around the country talking to the people who specialize in plants. Everyone from community gardeners, dairy farmers, commercial farmers, organic farmers, urban farmers, and professors of agriculture (check out our blog for information about these talks). These people have the insights and the understanding of what it takes to make food, and these are the people whom Carolyn Jane is questioning on her journey. Follow her trip on Instagram at @carolynjanenu and #VegCycleJourney, and please reach out if you know of people who can help answer her questions about how to grow food! 
The Team
Carolyn Jane, the Chief Growth Officer of VegCycle™ is a Mechanical Engineer who loves simple living and healthy eating. She has been studying entrepreneurship with Venture for America for the past 18months, and is launching her first idea through IndieGoGo. Carolyn Jane is passionate about food. She thinks about how to keep the top soil from eroding, keep fertilizers from leeching into ground water, and keep food food. At the same time she looks around her neighborhood, at the streets littered with chip bags and candy wrappers, and she is concerned for the families growing up within a mile of her who don't know what fresh basil tastes like. Carolyn Jane thinks VegCycle™ might be the first step towards addressing both of these problems in her neighborhood.
This project is different for Carolyn Jane, but she is thrilled to begin. In the past she has started gardens, led a team of engineers building a race car, and worked in machine shops. Her work over the past year as a project manager at BTG Labs - a local small business - helped her tune her skills that allow her to bridge the gap between science or engineering and people. Her experience managing (and machining for) Northwestern's Baja SAE team was extremely formative as it showed her for the first time that while she loved engineering, what matters most are the people - and a good company will put people first be those its employees or the surrounding community. Now, she is ready to combine all of those skills to try something bigger. 

    Other Ways to Help Thank you for reading this far! Check out garden and food tips on our IndieGoGo page and follow updates from Carolyn Jane's research trip on Instagram @carolynjanenu or #vegcyclejourney. If you have connections within the agriculture or urban farming industry, or even if someone in your family has an excellent recipe for pesto or compost, we would be honored for you to share those with us.
Talk us up! If you can't contribute now but you like our ideas, please share our page. It will bring you good karma and it will let us know that you are thinking of us. Thank you.

Note: you may opt-out of a perk so that the full contribution goes toward funding the business.
$2400 in kitchen equipment to make snacks my clients (& you), and to demonstrate to my clients various methods for preparing foods.
$400 in licensing & insurance, including: small business license, cottage foods license.
$2000 for marketing, networking and outreach.
$200 for securing domain name(s) and building a website, and $800 for maintaining over the remainder of the year. Because I'm not afraid to admit my techie-skills are not my strength!
approx $500 in fees to Indiegogo
STRETCH GOAL: help spread the word even further -- with particular focus in helping educate food-handlers in local schools -- AND, help cover the cost of my health coach tuition/certification.

<li>CLI command `shareAccount` that shares account A with account B and also adds the proper persona, configures Zimbra to store mail in the correct sent folder, and sets the correct FROM (persona) when replying.</li>
<li>CLI command `createPersona` that adds persona's based on the aliases of an account.</li>
<li>CLI command `cleanupAccount` that removes all shares and persona's from an account. Even if they where created outside these scripts. Useful to clean up after migration, upgrades or other issues where the Ajax webclient fails to load due to invalid shares. (This script will generate commands that you can run at discretion to  avoid loosing data.)</li>
<li>A how-to page on how to enable X-Authenticated-User header. Allowing one to track what person was sending mail when using a shared account FROM header.</li>
<li>An extension for the Admin UI for shareAccount and createPersona (deployment of this extension is optional, in case you only want to use the CLI tools, you do not need this extension)</li>
<li>Add a feature so that when a user clicks a shared mailbox, the inbox of that share is shown instead of 'No results found'.</li>

</ul></div>","Our goal is to develop a toolkit that consists of scripts, configuration examples and UI patches to bring back manageable mailbox sharing in Zimbra.We will develop:
CLI command `shareAccount` that shares account A with account B and also adds the proper persona, configures Zimbra to store mail in the correct sent folder, and sets the correct FROM (persona) when replying.
CLI command `createPersona` that adds persona's based on the aliases of an account.
CLI command `cleanupAccount` that removes all shares and persona's from an account. Even if they where created outside these scripts. Useful to clean up after migration, upgrades or other issues where the Ajax webclient fails to load due to invalid shares. (This script will generate commands that you can run at discretion to  avoid loosing data.)
A how-to page on how to enable X-Authenticated-User header. Allowing one to track what person was sending mail when using a shared account FROM header.
An extension for the Admin UI for shareAccount and createPersona (deployment of this extension is optional, in case you only want to use the CLI tools, you do not need this extension)
Add a feature so that when a user clicks a shared mailbox, the inbox of that share is shown instead of 'No results found'.
More goals may be added during the course of this campaign.

<p>Jun,
like many 6 year olds in Minamisanriku-cho, is living in temporary housing
since the 3/11 disaster wiped out 95 % of the town's infrastructure.</p>
<p>He
is part of a family of 5 living in a cramped, two room unit sincetemporary
housing was built in June/July of 2011. ""These conditions give no personal
space"", says Sato san, principle of the local junior high school.
""The children hear every fight, squabble, and tension that the parents
live. Even if they don't want to hear, they hear. Even if they don't want to
see, they see.""</p>
<p>Ongoing
life in post 3/11 Tohoku is full of struggle, and the PTSD among the
children aged Elementary through to Junior High is a major problem. </p>
<p>There
are more memories of the terror and trauma then anything else.  For OGA,
the challenge and urgent question has been: <b>How can we help the families
begin to create new experiences that are grounded in memories of warmth,
positivity, and security?  </b></p>
<p>The <b>OGA
Kids Fund</b> is a program that organises events, educational experiences, and
festivals for the surviving communities of the disaster stricken area.</p>
<p>Minamisanriku
survivors and OGA for Aid volunteers need your help to raise money and presents
— because we are all working together in 2014 to bring Santa to the children of
Tohoku.</p>
<p><b>This
holiday party brings survivor families from 3/11 -- now scattered all over
Japan --- back together again. This event is carried on year after year to
remind survivors that they are not alone and they are not forgotten.</b></p>
<p>Presents
have been donated, but we still need to raise $5,500 USD to fund the logistics,
shuttle buses, food and drink supplies, and fuel the Santa buses that will
carry presents to the far away villages of rural Tohoku.</p>

<p>After 3 and a half years, a lingering sense of helplessness
permeates the world of many survivors of 3/11. Cramped temporary housing living quarters are being extended
from temporary situations to long-term solutions, and even though many residents are cold and weather
beaten, residents have little choice but to remain in these sub standard living
conditions.</p>
<p>Christmas is a time for families to get
together, have joyful moments with children laughing, decorating
trees, opening presents... it is THE time for love and giving.  </p>
<p>This
year, Minamisanriku, Kessenuma, Ishinomaki, and Fukushima communities will
benefit from this project. Santa’s Christmas bus run will include 260 children <span>from over 500 local families.  400 survivors
will be present in Minamisanriku for the celebration on December 13th 2014.

<p>Invisible Partners is a not-for-profit entrepreneurship support group that helps small businesses grow. We are a collection of resources that helps create jobs through great <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/invisiblepartnersincubator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance"">business ideas</a>, careful planning, and the execution of proven strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is CharDale Barnes, and I started this group after being shown the power of service leadership. From 2010-2012, I served as college chapter officer for Phi Theta Kappa honors society (<a href=""http://www.ptk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ptk.org</a>). In 2011, I volunteered at the Open Door Mission (<a href=""http://www.opendoormission.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.opendoormission.org</a>) to help fight against <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/invisiblepartnersincubator?c=home&amp;a=855260"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">homelessness</a>. These activities helped me understand how people are positively affected by great leadership. The service-learning experience had a profound effect on my perspective and really changed my life as a result.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the very start of Invisible Partners, I found that there are an overwhelming number of great businesses waiting to flourish. But, they may not yet be ready to have a conversation with organizations such as the SBA, Omaha Small Business Network, or Chamber Of Commerce. In addition to having a great business concept, they also need <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/invisiblepartnersincubator?c=home&amp;a=855260"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">access</a> to more intimate business counseling sessions, a group of peers to help identify more of their immediate business opportunities, and of course finances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the Incubator Project?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Incubator Project is Invisible Partners’ answer to an unnecessary number of great small businesses falling apart prematurely. It is specifically, a place that  encourages the formation and development of small businesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a firm understanding of the core elements a company needs in the beginning, and without blindly throwing money and resources at random business ventures, Invisible Partners uses a special process to elect strong candidates for the Incubator Project. Once under our influence, we will utilize the best options for their company-type, and use proven business methods to yield the best outcome scenarios. When members come into the Incubator Project, our location will serve as a hub where they can fine-tune their business before stepping out on their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Should You Help?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We want Invisible Partners to be funded by supporters of our mission. As such, the donations we receive will help us acquire space sufficient to house the active members. Your contribution will also help acquire the business counseling, strategy, and marketing materials necessary to produce successful incubator companies. Members will be pleased to utilize this professional hub, as it is initially where clients will visit them to conduct meetings, hold seminars, and other regular business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High unemployment.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Ripple Effect</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We will start in Omaha, NE. We believe that with support, influencing these businesses with the Incubator Project will encourage them to grow. Based on our analysis, a business that is better supported early on in its development process has a much greater potential for success. A company influenced early on stands to flourish, and eventually contributes to its immediate community by promoting job growth.</p>

Our goal is to become a community hub for educating and empowering others towards sustainable living through workshops, speakers series, and programs for all ages. 
We're excited to open our doors in Kensington, Calgary in February, 2019. 
   
How It Works 

 
Our Perks

 The perks we have curated include many of our own favorite products!  They will be available for pick up, in store, when our doors open in February.  If you aren't located in Calgary and would like your items shipped, please contact us (there is an additional shipping cost that will be calculated after the campaign ends). The Gift Cards are simple...the more you contribute the more you get back in return!   
 
Our Ask
While we have secured a space in Kensington and some funding for our startup costs, funds generated through this campaign will help us renovate and equip our shop while minimizing our reliance on interest heavy loans. We are aiming to raise $25,000 through our amazing rewards and while our hope is to exceed this goal, all funds generated will be put to good use.  

 
Risks & Challenges
We have a small, temporary space to launch from in February where we are space sharing, keeping the rent low. In this way, we will be able to grow the business sustainably without a big overhead. We've done our research and know that Calgary is ready for us - early feedback has been nothing short of incredible! In a short time we've built an engaged audience and an amazing team of people that have helped get us here. We have very exciting plans for the future which will be implemented in the second phase of growth when we secure our permanent home.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We are so grateful for every contribution to our campaign.  Even if you are unable to back this project, it would mean the world to us (and the planet) if you would share this campaign with your friends and family on social media via the share buttons up top, email, OR scream it from your rooftop. No matter how big or small the support, it will make a difference. We look forward to welcoming you to our shop!

<p>One goal that Crocus is

a place where mental illness is openly talked about, and members are able to

people about mental health and create a better understanding of those diagnosed
with a mental illness.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The greatest risk and challenge to the Transitional Employment Program
is, conversely, its greatest strength. The flexibility that we provide our
members, allowing them to decide for themselves whether they are well
enough to work, gives them the confidence to become part of the

organization, we are sometimes deficient in the number of ""able bodied""
workers we have. </p>

<p>The solution is to ensure a large enough pool of

<h3>A Family in Harm's Way</h3>
<p>(Video coming soon)</p>
<p>Meet Ramona (the Mom), Keren (the oldest daughter), Joel (the man of the house), and JoiElla (the little princess).</p>
<p>Now, imagine them going home one day and it's completely empty. They haven't been burglarized, but the Dad has just left and taken everything with him. Ramona went to check her bank account but every dime had been withdrawn.</p>
<p><em>For a moment, imagine that happening to you.</em></p>
<p>Ramona experienced it. Her husband had left her and their children with nothing. She struggled to make ends meet, pay bills, and keep the home. Finally, they were evicted and forced to sleep outside in front of a local Hardee's restaurant. Then she found a homeless shelter. </p>
<p>Ramona's family has been at the shelter for over a year and has been told she must leave by February 1st.  Although she works, she doesn't make enough money to save. Not to mention, the eviction consumes her credit report forcing ""no"" after ""no"", apartment after apartment. </p>
<p>Ramona needs a ""yes.""</p>
<p>Her oldest daughter is 18 and in her 1st year of college. Ramona's 8-yr old son is an honor roll student and her 6-yr old daughter is a ball of sunshine. Ramona is rearing incredible children and doing all she can with what she has.</p>
<p><strong>On February 1st</strong>, this family of 4 is at risk for being on the street.</p>
<p><strong>Ramona wants just one thing: a home for her family. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Moving expenses and deposits for a new home add up quickly. This is where your help is critical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security deposit (equal to 1 month's rent)</li>
<li>6 months' rent (2 months are required for most complexes and private owners due to the eviction &amp; the additional 4 months give Ramona a headstart she desperately needs)</li>
<li>Utilities' deposit </li>
<li>Uhaul (their entire life's possessions are in storage)</li>

</div></div>","A Family in Harm's Way
(Video coming soon)
Meet Ramona (the Mom), Keren (the oldest daughter), Joel (the man of the house), and JoiElla (the little princess).
Now, imagine them going home one day and it's completely empty. They haven't been burglarized, but the Dad has just left and taken everything with him. Ramona went to check her bank account but every dime had been withdrawn.
For a moment, imagine that happening to you.
Ramona experienced it. Her husband had left her and their children with nothing. She struggled to make ends meet, pay bills, and keep the home. Finally, they were evicted and forced to sleep outside in front of a local Hardee's restaurant. Then she found a homeless shelter. 
Ramona's family has been at the shelter for over a year and has been told she must leave by February 1st.  Although she works, she doesn't make enough money to save. Not to mention, the eviction consumes her credit report forcing ""no"" after ""no"", apartment after apartment. 
Ramona needs a ""yes.""
Her oldest daughter is 18 and in her 1st year of college. Ramona's 8-yr old son is an honor roll student and her 6-yr old daughter is a ball of sunshine. Ramona is rearing incredible children and doing all she can with what she has.
On February 1st, this family of 4 is at risk for being on the street.
Ramona wants just one thing: a home for her family. 
 


What We Need & What You Get
Moving expenses and deposits for a new home add up quickly. This is where your help is critical.

Security deposit (equal to 1 month's rent)
6 months' rent (2 months are required for most complexes and private owners due to the eviction & the additional 4 months give Ramona a headstart she desperately needs)
Utilities' deposit 
Uhaul (their entire life's possessions are in storage)
Food (for 2 months)

I'm asking a total of $5,000.
Take a look at the Perks to see ""what you get"" for your generosity ---->>>
If we do not reach our goal, Ramona will still receive your donations!!!

<h3>Kind Auto</h3>
<p>My name is Von Ruder, but friends call me ""Aspen"". I have been an A.S.E. Certified Master Mechanic in Gainesville since 1983.</p>
<p>I have a unique ""carmic"" approach to auto repair. After years of working large corporate shops, I became dissolussioned (disgusted) by the ethics in my field. So I now work for myself and my clientele.</p>
<p>Auto repair is my Sadhana, my Path. It is how I give back to this sometimes crazy yet wondrous world of ours.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Almost There</h3>
<p>  We have found the perfect property with a 4 bay garage just blocks from our present location. The bank will not budge off the price and in 5 days, the place is available to investors (the wolves) and will be snapped up. If we give what they are asking (very firm!) we will be broke and not able to do the $5,000 dollars in repairs needed BEFORE move in.</p>
<p>Closing would be July 1st and we would need funds by then.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Ideology</h3>
<p>  I was fortunate to grow up in an era where I could follow the Grateful Dead on tour. At one venue, a girl had a sign that read ""WATER - $1 or KIND"". I had to ask, and her answer changed my life.</p>
<p> The water was a dollar. But if you didn't have a dollar, you could give out 20 hugs, or help someone, feed someone, pick flowers and hand them out. In other words, no one was going to go thirsty. </p>
<p> I try to bring that marraige of old school hippy idealism and reality to evertday practice. If I can help it - you won't have to walk! At K.A.R. we realize there is more than one way to go about a repair, and we work to suit YOUR needs. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help Us Spread the Love</h3>
<p>  If you can't donate cash, there are many ways to help! We will need a small army of volunteers to clean the place. An A/C duct person to replace all attic duct work (before move-in) and someone good at putting up wood privacy fence. And of course then the big move !</p>

<h2> Hello!</h2>
<p><strong>My dream has always been to provide a place where vegans, folks in transition, or the ""veggie curious"" could shop, where they could find something to help them, answer their questions, entertain them, educate them, or just plain make them laugh. Everyne is welcome here.  I provide cruelty-free, hard-to-find products to the South Sound area. I make it my goal to search out specialty vegan products and pantry items not found in my area. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I sell:  Cruelty free bags, shoes, makeup, body care products, jewelry, slogan t-shirts and totes. Gourmet vegan chocolates cookies and treats and  Specialty food items, cheeses, vitamins and mixes,  gift baskets to order, toys and treats for every holiday! Vintage housewares and more! </strong></p>
<p><strong>In our first year, we held our first annual ""Blanket Day for EGYHOP"" helping collect warm items for Olympia's downtown homeless, held a month-long fund raising campaign for Pigs Peace Sanctuary, Held a two-day ""Transition WorkShop Series"" for folks looking for help in beginning a vegan lifestyle, and welcomed vegan cookbook author Joshua Ploeg who not only entertained, but made us some amazing food! </strong></p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h2>
<strong>Heres what we are holding this fund raising campaign for :  Since we are still not taking paychecks, it has been difficult to collect the cash needed to pay off our small opening loan (a credit card) , and order new product for the store at the same time, while making sure we pay rent! </strong><strong>Our desire is to be able to continue through the holidays and into our second year, all the while spending our time searching for new and interesting hard to find vegan specialty items, bringing in products that our customers request, and new items from overseas too! <br/></strong><strong>In this we need your help- and dont forget- putting on special events like the ones listed above cost money too! Help us fund projects that help both our human and animal friends in need! </strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>**There are perks listed for specific amounts, but these amounts are not required to donate! Every amount counts! Even the small amounts! **<br/></strong></p>
<h2>
<strong><br/></strong><strong>The Impact</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>We want to be able to provide a much wider variety in our pantry section- we would like to expand into even more unique food items. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In our second year, a major goal is even more fund raising events for animal welfare organizations and sanctuaries we believe in, continuing to help those in need in our area, and of course to continue our outreach and workshops for those in transition or interested in going vegan but not sure where to start.</strong></p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p><strong>If you can't contribute, please help by inviting your friends who can, sharing our story, posting on Face Book and Twitter! Thank you!!</strong></p>

<p>My name is Kevin, my campaign is to initially raise $1000+ (or more) to fund an idea which I call <a href=""http://www.tullii.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Tullii"">Tiki Taxi iClub</a>. Just to be clear I am not offering to sell shares in a company or any kind of securities here, I am seeking donations from people, who either know me, or know my capabilities and seek to help me reach my initial goal to establish the first steps in getting this started, or perhaps they desire one of the great perks.</p>
<p>My goal is to start a simple online company using these funds. Your funds will build the backbone and get basics completed. The company will own 2 brands which I created. One brand, I invented at age 24, a second at age 37. This business structure is designed to own these brands, and help provide a way to achieve a personal dream that can only succeed by other people helping participating in it by getting the word out.</p>
<p>The dream, I want to fulfill, I need to start now. I need your help.</p>
<p>You see, just like I had this fun model below created and</p>
<p>it was a true model or concept of a tangible idea:</p>
<p><img alt=""Tiki 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7244/7287284128_8177719715_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Model Car""/></p>
<p>Which then became a real entity below: being a fun tiki theme car.</p>
<p>As you view the photo you are realizing that I don't think like everyone else?</p>
<p>I Never have, perhaps never will. It may seem silly but it worked amazingly well.</p>
<p>This project had a huge impact in its day and is a story in and of itself. But that is not why we are here today.</p>
<p><img alt=""Tiki 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7075/7287284858_49c86f6d1e_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""real car""/></p>
<p>Well, I came up with a <strong>new model</strong> below, one I call <strong>'Tiki Taxi iClub' </strong>model:</p>
<p>Perhaps a little more grown up than the other idea, but still kept the fun name.</p>
<p><img alt=""Tiki Model"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7217/7287284314_9e68513633_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Business Model""/></p>
<p>Just as I went from toy car to real car, I have also turned this Software into a real entity. Although it is less visible like the car was to the public due to the way it is constructed, it is perhaps less easy to show a picture of how it even works, but it is a functional online entity just the same.</p>
<p>And <strong>we're just about ready to rip</strong>, or peel out. Just like the fun image below, we just need to hit the gas pedal, shift gears, and we are going have serious traction and create some real smoke.</p>
<p><strong>                        Are you in?</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Peel Out"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8019/7287284592_5a5fa1e520_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ready to rip""/>.</p>
<p>I am in my own race against time, as a few years ago I learned I have a disease attacking a part of my brain which has brought upon its own challenges. I left work and I have taken the past few years of my time to organize what I already knew, get it out of my head, and put it into this company structure. In time, I may no longer be able to get things across the way I can right now,so for me, time is of the essence. </p>
<p>I have chosen to go the route of indiegogo and rely on friends, family, and people who buy into to fresh ideas. My condition is invisible to most but progressing. Although I am mortgage free, debt free and of sound mind (well that is debateable :) I still struggle to put in a regular work day compared to what I used to achieve in a full day.</p>
<p>However that doesn't mean I haven't already input valueable work and information into this concept. Which I am willing to let you be part of. I have had over $100K of flights spent on me flying me around the globe to chase certain resource hotspots which is just for starters, and I have a fairly good grasp on where the future is going in many industries. I also spend a few years at a $300 Billion corporation that helped build the internet, which just means I have a good guess as to where things are headed.</p>
<p>This isn't about me, so I'm not going to get all personal here, this is about sharing valuable ideas and truthful knowledge in order to bring about needed change to where it is needed, seeding other peoples dreams with capital and having fun doing so.</p>
<p>We are on the brink of some huge changes on this planet, and I want my brands to be part of the goodness of what I know is coming down the pipe.</p>
<p>The magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve will be impossible to express in words but can be summed up as this ""I am grateful for all you have done for me."" this is my gift back to friends, family, the planet. </p>
<p>For years I wanted to set up a structure that has potential for perpetual growth and excludes no one from participating, allows all to learn what I have learned the hard way, and which uses some of the data and knowledge I have worked so hard to acquire to propel ideas to a new level. I didn't have the tools before, now I do, and so do you. So take action now.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need fuel, and capital is the fuel. </strong>Why just a <strong>$1000</strong>?, well I hope to exceed this amount by alot X2,X3,X10, but I also want to hit my target so $1K is our first monetary goal to hit by <strong>June 20th</strong>, and should be easily met by the intended date required. Any amount over the goal will be deployed in further setting up the iclub structure or expanding it.</p>
<p>First I need $500 to file an<strong> LLC</strong> or a Limited Liability Company. Next, I will use this entity to obtain a Trademark under its name that will survive me and be owned by the <strong>LLC</strong>. An additional $400 to set-up a 2nd entity and join the 2 by agreements. $100 to file fees and paperwork. Sounds simple enough.</p>
<p>Then what I need is <strong>MEMBERS</strong>, people who want to participate in this idea, I'm good at that part. I'm good at attracting people.</p>
<p>The rest of the necessary funds to build our model will come in via <strong>online memberships</strong> sold to interested parties who want to be a part of this project and its concept and its model. I also have a grant application pending but that is independent of this indiegogo site effort.</p>
<p>The plan is the<strong> LLC</strong> will buy a <strong>50%</strong> <strong>stake</strong> in an existing private numbered canadian corporation. This company already exists, and it has already obtained 100% rights to all my intellectual property via a pre-existing registered security agreement. Its ready to go. This was expensive and timely to set-up, its done. If I were to be hit by a bus tomorrow this structure would be in place to keep things going.</p>
<p>A partnership between the <strong>LLC</strong> and a legitimate formed investment club entity will uses my service mark as its partnership trade name. The partnership will be called <strong>""Tiki Taxi Investment Club</strong>"", it will be part owned by a USA LLC who will initially fund it using any proceeds raised here or from its new members. It will also have a part ownership from a Canada entity who feeds it intel and data that has been in the works for quite some time. It will use TDAmeritrade Platform and myiclub.com accounting software.</p>
<p>The <strong>First 100</strong> Members or so, will visit a website and receive an email inviting them to join by signing simple agreements.</p>
<p>Then via mail or electronic signature via Docusign.net or <strong>Yousendit.com</strong>, a very simple 1 page arrangement. Membership Payments online via paypal or (interac in Canada) or (ACH in USA). It can all be done at home from your computer. Easy. Simple. Legal.</p>
<p>The iclub entity will operate transparently and visibly at <strong>myiclub.com</strong> as a legitimate registered investment club in the <strong>USA, </strong>and for<strong> Canada </strong>a similar deal, utilizing some of the newest technology only just years old. The club will allow users from anywhere in the world to login, and see what we are upto.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of name</strong>: Tiki to me means a spiritual wanderer, and Taxi means mechanism to get from A to B, so Tiki Taxi to me meant a way to get people to join me from getting from one place to another. In this case, the club is just an online method of pooling intel from many locations and resources into viable ventures that I hope will grow enough to help assist others in carrying out their dreams too.  </p>
<p><strong>The iclub</strong> will initially have <strong>2</strong> <strong>membership</strong> categories for sale:</p>
<p>1)<strong>Watch and learn</strong> member which is <strong>$12/year</strong> and which these members can see what is going on, but have no financial stake in the club, they can just watch and learn. If they want to copy us on their own, no problem. If they want to join up they become and active stakeholder member, see below.</p>
<p>2)<strong>Active and Stakeholder member</strong> which do have a stake in club assets and can <strong>vote </strong>on what the raised funds will go into, which can be from min <strong>$100/yr</strong> per person upto a <strong>maximum of 25%</strong> of the <strong>total club assets</strong> at any given time. If the assets were $1000, then the max for any one new member would be $250. If the assets were $50,000, then the max would be $12,500. The minimum to vote or have a stake in club is $100/year.</p>
<p><strong>Each club member</strong> will have the opportunity to just watch and learn, or if they choose to, they can become an active paid member for the price of a movie ticket, whom also can recieve a share of this club assets in proportion to what they choose to  participate which can be as little as <strong>$8.33/month</strong> or one time for <strong>$100/year</strong>.</p>
<p>I have sold all my intellectual property to a numbered company in Canada whom holds everything I own or ever created, of which the <strong>LLC</strong> will own <strong>50%</strong>, and of which the iclub will also benefit from data and intellectual property in certain other ways. (This IP is non-public information as it is pending filing intellectual property documents but will be revealed over time as needed.)</p>
<p>As additional resources are raised over time, a second investment club entity in Canada will be started usind a second Brand already set-up, to do what cannot necessarily be done in the USA pertaining to certain Canadian Securities rules or ones not listed in US, or on, USA exchanges. Each side of the border will have a <strong>50%</strong> stake in the other entity so that all cross-border bases are covered.</p>
<p>The funds will be deployed in things I understand. established Brand Names, and certain Resources. Their is a whole Business Plan developed that manages risk but exploits some of the hottest property on the planet in silver, gold, oil, and rare materials, plus land positions that are set to capitalize on discoveries I am aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes, </strong>the<strong> LLC</strong> and <strong>investment club</strong> do not pre-pay state or individual taxes. USA Members are therefore required to file any capital gains they withdraw themselves where they reside. Canada Members are the same deal. Withdrawals are only allowed 3x per year at or on online meeting dates, as are extra contributions to keep it simple and organized.</p>
<p>Who am I? My work background is rather diverse, I have been in Marketing, Sales, Engineering firms and Oil and Gas industries. I have promoted several Brands, some of which were world class brand names, some were not. I have run a small business, and been a manager with major corporations, and a bunch of other skilled jobs that seem to matter less now facing these other personal issues. I have also been on exploration discovery wells in 4 continents and I know where the best future oil and gas reserves are situated, who owns them, and who has best chance succeeding. I intend to put non-proprietary data into a business model to benefit all the members.</p>
<p>One fact remains is it takes money to solve many problems in this world, more than money it takes mindful people to direct the money appropriately to solve those problems. I promote mindful capitalism, governments try and succeed in certain areas but the heart and minds of regular people seem to be more impactful, more resourceful and faster acting than big entities like the governments. I intend to attract those who share this sentiment.</p>
<p>I have a super pipeline of up and coming ventures already researched to seed this model for 2-5 years to get it going, the rest will be up to the calibre of the members. For me, I have no time to wait, I must act now, so I hope you can believe that I know what I am doing, and come along for the ride.</p>
<p>I intend to proove that last statement as best I can. So part of the plan is to return or re-seed money raised to help other peoples dreams be realized. So <strong>10%</strong> of any money raised here that is over the initial $1000 mark will be used to help fund other peoples goals (<strong>5%</strong> here on indiegogo and <strong>5%</strong> on our Kiva microfinance page).</p>

<p><strong>And that’s all there is to it.</strong></p></div>","Summary:
My name is Kevin, my campaign is to initially raise $1000+ (or more) to fund an idea which I call Tiki Taxi iClub. Just to be clear I am not offering to sell shares in a company or any kind of securities here, I am seeking donations from people, who either know me, or know my capabilities and seek to help me reach my initial goal to establish the first steps in getting this started, or perhaps they desire one of the great perks.
My goal is to start a simple online company using these funds. Your funds will build the backbone and get basics completed. The company will own 2 brands which I created. One brand, I invented at age 24, a second at age 37. This business structure is designed to own these brands, and help provide a way to achieve a personal dream that can only succeed by other people helping participating in it by getting the word out.
The dream, I want to fulfill, I need to start now. I need your help.
You see, just like I had this fun model below created and
it was a true model or concept of a tangible idea:

Which then became a real entity below: being a fun tiki theme car.
As you view the photo you are realizing that I don't think like everyone else?
I Never have, perhaps never will. It may seem silly but it worked amazingly well.
This project had a huge impact in its day and is a story in and of itself. But that is not why we are here today.

Well, I came up with a new model below, one I call 'Tiki Taxi iClub' model:
Perhaps a little more grown up than the other idea, but still kept the fun name.

Just as I went from toy car to real car, I have also turned this Software into a real entity. Although it is less visible like the car was to the public due to the way it is constructed, it is perhaps less easy to show a picture of how it even works, but it is a functional online entity just the same.
And we're just about ready to rip, or peel out. Just like the fun image below, we just need to hit the gas pedal, shift gears, and we are going have serious traction and create some real smoke.
                        Are you in?
.
I am in my own race against time, as a few years ago I learned I have a disease attacking a part of my brain which has brought upon its own challenges. I left work and I have taken the past few years of my time to organize what I already knew, get it out of my head, and put it into this company structure. In time, I may no longer be able to get things across the way I can right now,so for me, time is of the essence. 
I have chosen to go the route of indiegogo and rely on friends, family, and people who buy into to fresh ideas. My condition is invisible to most but progressing. Although I am mortgage free, debt free and of sound mind (well that is debateable :) I still struggle to put in a regular work day compared to what I used to achieve in a full day.
However that doesn't mean I haven't already input valueable work and information into this concept. Which I am willing to let you be part of. I have had over $100K of flights spent on me flying me around the globe to chase certain resource hotspots which is just for starters, and I have a fairly good grasp on where the future is going in many industries. I also spend a few years at a $300 Billion corporation that helped build the internet, which just means I have a good guess as to where things are headed.
This isn't about me, so I'm not going to get all personal here, this is about sharing valuable ideas and truthful knowledge in order to bring about needed change to where it is needed, seeding other peoples dreams with capital and having fun doing so.
We are on the brink of some huge changes on this planet, and I want my brands to be part of the goodness of what I know is coming down the pipe.
The magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve will be impossible to express in words but can be summed up as this ""I am grateful for all you have done for me."" this is my gift back to friends, family, the planet. 
For years I wanted to set up a structure that has potential for perpetual growth and excludes no one from participating, allows all to learn what I have learned the hard way, and which uses some of the data and knowledge I have worked so hard to acquire to propel ideas to a new level. I didn't have the tools before, now I do, and so do you. So take action now.
What We Need & What You Get
We need fuel, and capital is the fuel. Why just a $1000?, well I hope to exceed this amount by alot X2,X3,X10, but I also want to hit my target so $1K is our first monetary goal to hit by June 20th, and should be easily met by the intended date required. Any amount over the goal will be deployed in further setting up the iclub structure or expanding it.
First I need $500 to file an LLC or a Limited Liability Company. Next, I will use this entity to obtain a Trademark under its name that will survive me and be owned by the LLC. An additional $400 to set-up a 2nd entity and join the 2 by agreements. $100 to file fees and paperwork. Sounds simple enough.
Then what I need is MEMBERS, people who want to participate in this idea, I'm good at that part. I'm good at attracting people.
The rest of the necessary funds to build our model will come in via online memberships sold to interested parties who want to be a part of this project and its concept and its model. I also have a grant application pending but that is independent of this indiegogo site effort.
The plan is the LLC will buy a 50% stake in an existing private numbered canadian corporation. This company already exists, and it has already obtained 100% rights to all my intellectual property via a pre-existing registered security agreement. Its ready to go. This was expensive and timely to set-up, its done. If I were to be hit by a bus tomorrow this structure would be in place to keep things going.
A partnership between the LLC and a legitimate formed investment club entity will uses my service mark as its partnership trade name. The partnership will be called ""Tiki Taxi Investment Club"", it will be part owned by a USA LLC who will initially fund it using any proceeds raised here or from its new members. It will also have a part ownership from a Canada entity who feeds it intel and data that has been in the works for quite some time. It will use TDAmeritrade Platform and myiclub.com accounting software.
The First 100 Members or so, will visit a website and receive an email inviting them to join by signing simple agreements.
Then via mail or electronic signature via Docusign.net or Yousendit.com, a very simple 1 page arrangement. Membership Payments online via paypal or (interac in Canada) or (ACH in USA). It can all be done at home from your computer. Easy. Simple. Legal.
The iclub entity will operate transparently and visibly at myiclub.com as a legitimate registered investment club in the USA, and for Canada a similar deal, utilizing some of the newest technology only just years old. The club will allow users from anywhere in the world to login, and see what we are upto.
Meaning of name: Tiki to me means a spiritual wanderer, and Taxi means mechanism to get from A to B, so Tiki Taxi to me meant a way to get people to join me from getting from one place to another. In this case, the club is just an online method of pooling intel from many locations and resources into viable ventures that I hope will grow enough to help assist others in carrying out their dreams too.  
The iclub will initially have 2 membership categories for sale:
1)Watch and learn member which is $12/year and which these members can see what is going on, but have no financial stake in the club, they can just watch and learn. If they want to copy us on their own, no problem. If they want to join up they become and active stakeholder member, see below.
2)Active and Stakeholder member which do have a stake in club assets and can vote on what the raised funds will go into, which can be from min $100/yr per person upto a maximum of 25% of the total club assets at any given time. If the assets were $1000, then the max for any one new member would be $250. If the assets were $50,000, then the max would be $12,500. The minimum to vote or have a stake in club is $100/year.
Each club member will have the opportunity to just watch and learn, or if they choose to, they can become an active paid member for the price of a movie ticket, whom also can recieve a share of this club assets in proportion to what they choose to  participate which can be as little as $8.33/month or one time for $100/year.
I have sold all my intellectual property to a numbered company in Canada whom holds everything I own or ever created, of which the LLC will own 50%, and of which the iclub will also benefit from data and intellectual property in certain other ways. (This IP is non-public information as it is pending filing intellectual property documents but will be revealed over time as needed.)
As additional resources are raised over time, a second investment club entity in Canada will be started usind a second Brand already set-up, to do what cannot necessarily be done in the USA pertaining to certain Canadian Securities rules or ones not listed in US, or on, USA exchanges. Each side of the border will have a 50% stake in the other entity so that all cross-border bases are covered.
The funds will be deployed in things I understand. established Brand Names, and certain Resources. Their is a whole Business Plan developed that manages risk but exploits some of the hottest property on the planet in silver, gold, oil, and rare materials, plus land positions that are set to capitalize on discoveries I am aware of.
Taxes, the LLC and investment club do not pre-pay state or individual taxes. USA Members are therefore required to file any capital gains they withdraw themselves where they reside. Canada Members are the same deal. Withdrawals are only allowed 3x per year at or on online meeting dates, as are extra contributions to keep it simple and organized.
Who am I? My work background is rather diverse, I have been in Marketing, Sales, Engineering firms and Oil and Gas industries. I have promoted several Brands, some of which were world class brand names, some were not. I have run a small business, and been a manager with major corporations, and a bunch of other skilled jobs that seem to matter less now facing these other personal issues. I have also been on exploration discovery wells in 4 continents and I know where the best future oil and gas reserves are situated, who owns them, and who has best chance succeeding. I intend to put non-proprietary data into a business model to benefit all the members.
One fact remains is it takes money to solve many problems in this world, more than money it takes mindful people to direct the money appropriately to solve those problems. I promote mindful capitalism, governments try and succeed in certain areas but the heart and minds of regular people seem to be more impactful, more resourceful and faster acting than big entities like the governments. I intend to attract those who share this sentiment.
I have a super pipeline of up and coming ventures already researched to seed this model for 2-5 years to get it going, the rest will be up to the calibre of the members. For me, I have no time to wait, I must act now, so I hope you can believe that I know what I am doing, and come along for the ride.
I intend to proove that last statement as best I can. So part of the plan is to return or re-seed money raised to help other peoples dreams be realized. So 10% of any money raised here that is over the initial $1000 mark will be used to help fund other peoples goals (5% here on indiegogo and 5% on our Kiva microfinance page).

It also raises awareness of rural women on their equal status and rights. Each course offers a minimum loan to each woman after graduating to initiate their own small businesses using their newly learned skills of value adding the traditional embroidery!
ABOUT THE SUGHAR PRODUCTS!
The beautiful products that you are seeing below are a creation of women in Tribal and Rural areas of Pakistan, who even living under the strict customs of their tribes have the best knowledge in design and quality! 
Having to see these amazing skills of rural women in villages of Pakistan, Sughar in early 2012 launched Pakistan's first ever rural Women Fashion Brand! This was a big step in the fashion industry of Pakistan when Rural and tribal women were defining fashion in their own style!
Right now, when the program reaches to more then 700 women, we are struggling with the sustainability as well as helping these women launch their businesses as the only market being targeted was Pakistan's. What Sughar needs from you now is to take Pakistani Rural Women Embroidery Art to the world out there and let everyone see, feel, and wear with pride the products that these women create!

with limited trees or vegetation. Third, the garden will provide an area for
practitioners to grow medicinal herbs for treatments. Finally, as an alternative

Rooted in the connection to Farmers and Makers of Real FoodSpring Run Market, a farm-direct co-op & market, dreams of opening a neighborhood market showcasing local and organic foods, and where we can educate folks about Real Food and Real Health!
We founded Spring Run over 5 years ago with a vision of creating a community hub centered on the message of fresh foods and holistic living! At Spring Run, we focus on “Real Food”, providing organic freshness, nothing refined, processed or modified.Our Crowdfunder Appeal is calling for help in transforming a space on Charles Blvd. into an organic market filled with fresh produce, meats & more, a fresh juice/smoothie/snack bar, plus a space to hold our workshops. There are currently very few places to buy fresh local AND organic foods in Greenville, so the need for a market dedicated to these foods is great, not only for the community that lives here but also the 20,000+ students and transients that come through Greenville every year!
Our History

Spring Run Market was born in fall of 2008, when we formed a co-op for a local beef Farm, Nooherooka Natural, who had no outlet in Greenville at the time. Organically grown produce was added through Jones Farm, then Brothers Farm, then later Gray's Garden, and we just grew from there :)

In Sept 2009, we had our first major open-air market event in Arlington Village, becoming the very first outlet in Greenville for local organics, with our winter markets indoors at the Tipsy Teapot to keep us year-round. 
                                  ""2009 Fall Pirate Invasion""
We grew from there over the next few years to a 6-8 tent open-air market, with local farms, vendors, non-profits, CSA’s, and an online marketplace. In those early days, it felt like an insurgence, as the resistance to buying foods in this way was not exactly well received. Things like sprouted flours, local & organic produce, and truly natural meats raised on pasture, were pretty foreign to our area. 
But today, SRM feels like a revolution, with hundreds of folks patroning our market, with a core of about 75 families, that connects them directly to over 50 local small-scale farmers, ranchers, various food producers, bakers, body care producers, and more, who all care about healthy people and a healthy environment!     2012 Market at the Tipsy TeapotOver time, we added in a few non-local bulk order items, such as raw organic cheeses and sprouted grain flours & berries, as the quality and availability was hard to source nearby. We’ve become home to local businesses, such as Healthy Vibrant YOU (gluten free snacks and health coaching), and Good Stuff NC (cold-pressed organic juices), and to non-profits, such as ENC Stop Human Trafficking.Local non-foods such as handcrafted soaps and Alpaca products, have been regulars to our markets. We’ve organized many events, like Brothers Farm Potlucks, “Local Dinner & a Movie” nights, and workshops ranging from how to make smoothies, to gluten-free living. It’s been an absolutely amazing journey, and we’ve loved serving our community to a healthier life!!We are poised at the brink of a food renaissance, but we need your helpToday, however, our product selection, availability, and breadth is still limited. Because we don’t have the means or equipment necessary to carry much inventory, orders from some of our suppliers have to be limited to certain times of the month and, to get better pricing, some have high minimum-quantity requirements. These restrictions mean that members need to plan their meals and pickups in advance, which can be tough for busy families.Our supporters, farms & customers alike, have been telling us for a long time, they’d love to see us open a place that’s open more days and hours, rather than just a few hours on Saturdays. We know that the community values our services and the access we provide to farm-direct and bulk foods, and we feel the imperative, the call to action: we must better meet the need for local & organic products!
Click to see ""OUR PASSION"" video :)

Our mandate is clear and our vision inspires us every dayOur vision is to create a sustainable entity that will allow not just our present supporters, but the public at large, to support local and organic farmers, ranchers, bakers, and other producers. Our dream: to open a small, but bountiful storefront market offering a wisely selected inventory of organically raised Real Food, organic bulk items, and truly natural household goods, with a Smoothie/ Juice/ Snack “Cafétte”, PLUS continued offerings of our Real Food & Real Health Workshops in the space, while continuing connection with the community with other events at our farms and network of supporters!The market would share space with several of our vendors, including Healthy Vibrant YOU (gluten-free snacks) and Good Stuff Juices, and have daily hours of operations, setting our members free from the restrictions of a once-a-week 3-hour pickup window. 
Johnny & Brittany, Good Stuff Cold-pressed JuicesDebbie Kettler, Health Coach & Gluten-free SnacksHaving a storefront would give us so much, and would change our impact on the community immeasurably. It would allow us to serve a more diverse population, to provide increased visibility for our valued growers and producers, and to have that high-touch, high-service connection with all our community members we so would like opportunity to give more than once a week! We want to see our vision expand into a dynamic community space where people can come to learn and share in the joy of organic, Real Food. We’re asking you to join us in that quest.Access to fresh seasonal produce, meats, seafood, eggs, and more begins hereFor the past few weeks, we have been working hard on planning, and are now renovating the space on Charles Blvd, next to ASAP Photo & Camera. We have the enthusiastic support of our project by the owners at ASAP (our wonderful landlords), from our patrons of the market, and family and friends, and we have close working relations with dozens of local producers who care about the health of families and the environment. We have conducted a survey (you can have your opinion counted too!) and know what the community wants us to stock. With nearly 200 folks responding so far, the TOP 4 REQUESTS are:Fresh Produce & HerbsChicken & EggsNuts & Seeds Beef Click to take our Short Survey :)Other items we plan to have in the store are: Local and Pastured Pork, Lamb, and other Meats; Organic Bulk items; Organic Sprouted Flours and Berries; Organic Jarred and Canned Goods; Organic Raw Cheeses; Carefully selected Organic Dry (Shelf) Items; Organic Body Care; Other Locally Produced Non-food items; and MORE!! 
Most of our inventory will be locally produced, and nearly all will be organically produced and raised! One thing that will set us apart and will be vital to busy families is our incorporation of recipes and menus based on what is available seasonally and on the items in our store. And if we don't carry recipe ingredients, we'll be constantly adding to our list of of those items and where you can buy them! Our ""Caffete"" will slowly expand to eventually be a full cafe, so providing meals to take home will be our goal for the future!You are the vital ingredient, our needed coalitionYour generous contributions, rewarded with useful items and mouth-watering yummy goodness (see right hand side bar) will help us with our start-up list:• Our biggest purchase by far...coolers and freezers• Commercial Oven/ Stovetop • Commercial Blenders/ Juicers • Glass display cases • Stainless Prep Tables • Seating & tables• TV, Sound System for our workshops • Exterior Sign 

• Misc In-Store (shop carts/ baskets, mats, etc) 
• Lighting 
(These add up to  $19,900, with some items priced as new and some at used pricing)

We've set our ""Stretch Goal"" for another $5000, which would cover:Office Equipment & Supplies (includes our POS)Marketing & Promotions 

Our goal ($20,000)  is about a third of what we need to open, with a fully renovated, equipped and stocked store. However, we
haven't raised the amount we need and be ready to
open the market by June. And that’s why we are here now, asking for your help
to meet our goals for the equipment we need to get started.The majority of the rest of our budget (renovations, consumable expenses, small starting inventory, and working capital) is coming from a small business loan; after that, from a couple of fundraising events in May, investors, and small personal loans from individuals (implemented through Slow Money Organization).

All funds raised, whether investment loans or donations, will be kept separate from the present market operations and dedicated solely to the new market project. Money raised will be used carefully & efficiently, demonstrated in our business plan, with our vision of a functional, energy efficient, sustainable organic market as a blueprint. We also wanted to mention that we will consider any non-cash donations, esp in the form of any equipment mentioned above!Help us feed our community the best food on the planet We are now appealing to our greater community to help Spring Run continue to grow, share and educate in the model of socially responsible and healthy lifestyle choices. We know that your energetic support will help us exceed our goal; after all, our work supports our farmers and growers, too, and we want to see them thrive and be rewarded for all the hard work they do making all this delicious goodness available!Please join us at the forefront of the Food Revolution and help make this dream a reality! Tell your friends and family; support, share, inspire, give -- and get rewarded...your taste buds (and the rest of your body) will thank you! We are so close and with your help we can have the store open in just a few weeks. Thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts, for pledging generously and supporting Local Organic Food!
