<p>Hello!  My name is Bill Cresse.  I'm a Mechanical Engineer, and I live in Boise, Idaho.  I'm on a mission for people who suffer chronic shoulder pain &amp; post-operative shoulder surgery patients.  600,000 Americans have shoulder surgery each and every year.  40% of Americans have chronic shoulder pain.  </p>
<p>My mission is to end nighttime suffering for people with chronic shoulder pain.  I've had a torn rotator cuff in my left shoulder for over 25 years (never had surgery).  I've dealt with the pain, instability &amp; discomfort at night by using various pillows &amp; sleeping positions.  Fast forward to August 2018...  </p>
<p>I started my own small business (Cresse Product Development) focused on consumer &amp; medical product development.  We've been focused on developing a new product.  It's a sleeping pillow (actually it's a family of shoulder pillow products) that allows people with chronic shoulder pain or post-operative shoulder surgery patients to lay down, recline &amp; sleep more comfortably, with less pain, and without unprescribed shoulder movement.  </p>
<p>We are currently in-process on testing prototype pillows with post-operative shoulder surgery patients.  Here's an image of the sling arm configuration of the shoulder pillow, which was developed specifically for post-operative shoulder surgery patients.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562711783/wfev9yhtkaiexabc0yvy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here's where you come in...  In order to continue our mission, we need funding.  We need funding in order to --- </p>
<ul>
<li>Continue fabricating custom prototype pillows for patients willing to test said pillows.  We provide said prototype pillows to said patients at no charge, in exchange for them giving design feedback (good or bad) and critiquing the prototypes.  Our target is 30 user stories for each pillow model.  </li>
<li>Perform a market study to validate market size ($140M yearly for post-op patients), and analyze competitors, customers &amp; products.  </li>
<li>Recruit talent.  In particular, we need expertise in medical product sales, eCommerce sales &amp; marketing, CAD, process automation, and <strong>mass customization</strong>.  </li>
<li>Create production hard tooling for the first three (3) pillow models, i.e. Sling Arm Configuration, Unaffected-Side Side-Sleeper, and Back Sleeper / Standard.  </li>
<li>Continue automating our processes to allow <strong>mass customization</strong> of our products, as this gives us a substantial competitive advantage.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The deliverables resulting from this funding include --- </p>
<ul>
<li>7,000 pillows shipped.  </li>
<li>Team on-boarded.  </li>
<li>Pillows tooled.  </li>
<li>Pillow certification testing (CertiPUR-US).  </li>
<li>Distribution setup.  </li>
<li>Intellectual property secured (utility patent already pending).  </li>
<li>Processes automated.  </li>
<li>Mass customization running smoothly from online ordering (eCommerce) &amp; patient measurement (3D laser scan) through CNC foam cutting &amp; automated adhesive dispensing.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks and challenges include --- </p>
<p>FINDING PATIENTS:  Thus far, we have fabricated prototype pillows for 12 patients.  The current average is one (1) new patient per week.  Waiting 18 more weeks to get to 30 user stories would be undesirable. </p>
<p>SALES EXPERTISE:  We need medical product sales expertise in the Durable Medical Equipment (DME) space. </p>
<p>TALENT ACQUISITION:  Boise is a small market.  Will we be able to attract the right sales, marketing &amp; eCommerce expertise?  Similarly, will we be able to attract the right CAD, process automation &amp; mass customization engineering expertise? </p>
<p>FOAM MOLDERS/FABRICATORS:  Funding will solve the problem of foam fabricators &amp; foam molders not being responsive.  $250K in funding will motivate them to be responsive. </p>
<p>MASS CUSTOMIZATION:  Our target of two (2) minutes from start of patient measurement process to CNC file waiting at CNC foam cutting machine is aggressive.  Our target of four (4) day absolute maximum total lead-time from customer measurement to customer receipt of pillow is aggressive (assumes certain customers pay for expediated shipment of foam components, and final pillow). </p>
<p>SALES GOAL:  Shipping almost 7,000 units by the end of year one is aggressive.  </p>
<p>In conclusion, please contribute to bring great pillow products to many people who really, really need a good night’s sleep, less shoulder pain &amp; less shoulder discomfort.  And, please remember our <strong>mantra</strong>:  Less pain, more comfort &amp; better sleep, for sleeping &amp; recovering shoulders.  Finally, please share the link to this campaign page with your friends, family &amp; coworkers.  Don't forget Indiegogo share tools.  Thank you!  </p>

<h3>
<span style=""color: #ff9900;"">Please Help Ian</span><br/><br/>My nephew Ian. What can I say he is the most amazing child I have ever met with the most amazing sense of humor and always greats you with a smile. He is resilient and strong yet every day he faces pain constant pain.<br/><br/>Ian has what's known as EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa). you may ask ""what is that""? Well it is an inherited connective tissue disease causing blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.<br/><br/>As a result, the skin is extremely fragile. Minor friction or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters. Often referred to as Butterfly Children due to the fact that their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. It's much like a severe burn in Ian's case all over his body. Ian lives in severe pain on constant pain medication to try to help keep him comfortable. <br/><br/> A bump or scratch or even moving the wrong way can case the skin blister and break. It's a constant battle, one area of the skin heals and then blisters again or won't heal at all. Scar tissue develops making it even worse restricting the movement of arms and legs and even opening the mouth. It doesn't stop there, blisters also develop internally in the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. For EB kids the risk of infection is high and can be fatal. Regular bandage changes are required and are nothing short of horrible and extremely painful.<br/><br/>In short it is a horrific disease, extremely painful and debilitating. Ian was born with RDEB which is considered to be a severe strain of this disease. Ian is bandaged from head to toe  with blistering and open wounds over most of his body. Ian is unable to walk and is confined to a wheel <br/> chair. Ian can not sit up on his own or dress himself and requires constant care. When born Ian was not given much chance of survival and wasn't expected<br/>to still be with us today. It is a shear miracle Ian is still with us today and has reached the age of 14.<br/><br/>87% of children born with one of the more sever forms of EB like Ian's do not live more then 12 months. <br/><br/> Ian enjoys arts and crafts, likes painting and drawing and watching the Food Network on TV. He enjoys spending time with his Brothers and Sister and his little kitten. Ian dreams of being a Firefighter when he grows up. He collects firefighting memorabilia and just loves all things do do with firefighting. He has an amazing attitude for a child who is in so much pain. With all the procedures he has to endure Ian still <br/> manages to retain his sense of humor and I don't know how.<br/><br/>Ian had the chance of a life time a few weeks ago to travel to Ohio to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital EB Clinic. The reason for his visit was to tackle the issue of how Ian will be able to eat. <br/><br/> Ian has a feeding tube in his nose which provides him with vital nutrition. However in order to continue to insert a feeding tube every few months Ian has to undergo the procedure of having his esophagus dilated. This is alway a risky procedure as the esophagus is very thin and fragile to start with. Ian has had this procedure so many times it is no longer safe to continue to insert this tube. Without it Ian would be unable to eat and unable to survive. High amounts of nutrition are required to help the body heal the skin and fight infection.<br/><br/>His trip to Cincinnati was to hopefully find another way for Ian to be given food. In the past other methods had been tried and failed due to the deterioration of his skin. <br/><br/> Ian's visit was a huge success in one way as the doctors will in the coming weeks be able to dilate his esophagus and remove the tube from his nose. However he will have to under go a surgical procedure to insert a Mickey Button in his belly. At the same time Ian will have to have a total of 10 teeth removed, children with EB often have huge issues with teeth.<br/><br/>If that is not enough during his visit to Cincinnati it was discovered that his spleen and liver were enlarged and after further investigation they found 2 tumors one on each adrenal gland. Just when you think it can't get any worse for him, he will now have to have a biopsy to find out what they are before he can have his tube removed, his Mickey button inserted and his teeth pulled.<br/><br/>The cost alone of the trips to and from Cincinnati for long periods of time is to much for my sister to endure. Ian being confined to a wheel chair making travel all together difficult. By car it is an 8 hour drive from Pennsylvania to Ohio. <br/><br/> Ian and my sister will have to travel alone to Ohio and stay for long periods of time. Ian has always had trouble in recovering for any procedure and gets very sick after words during this recovery time Ian will not be able to travel home until he is 100%, again making the stays very long. <br/><br/> Ian's brothers and sister have to continue with school and my sisters husband has to continue work to keep the roof over their head and it is going to be impossible for them to manage all this without help. A one income family who is struggling to survive as it is can not possible manage this and that's why we need your help.<br/><br/>Our aim is to raise as much as we can to help cover the costs for Ian's trips to Cincinnati Ohio over the next year.<br/><br/>Any future medical care for Ian will be address in Cincinnati as they have the specialist with the experience needed to treat Ian. The local hospital where Ian has been treated feels that Ian's medical needs have become to specialized for them to continue to handle. So Ian will now be faced with traveling to Cincinnati for just about everything.<br/><br/>We just can't afford to cover the trips to Ohio alone we need to raise as much as we can in a short period of time to help get Ian to Cincinnati. Now that they have discovered the tumors on Ian's adrenal glads he will need to travel soon.<br/><br/>The cost of travel, food, accommodation for extended stays will mount quickly and Ian really need your help.<br/><br/>If you could find in your heart to help Ian it would mean the world to Ian and his family. Any donation no matter how small can help. If you would like to offer any assistance at all in any way please email at helpian@hotmail.com.<br/><br/>We will be posting regular updates on Ian's Facebook Page, Twitter Page &amp; Blog.<br/><br/>Facebook: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ian.swarr.37"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">www.facebook.com/ian.swarr.37</a></span> please follow Ian's Story. <br/><br/> You can visit Ian's web page: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.helpian.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">www.helpian.weebly.com</a></span><br/><br/>Follow Ian on Twitter: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/HelpIan1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">https://twitter.com/HelpIan1</a></span><br/><br/>Please follow Ian's Blog Online</h3>

<h3>Update Oct 6th 2012 : Ian will be admited to Cincinnati Childrens Hospital on Tuesday. Please keep him in your thoughts! More Updates will be posted here if you would like to check back!<br/> <br/>Update Oct 7th 2012: Ian was feeling sleepy today but in good spirits! He wants to be sure to get his Halloween costume before he goes to Cincinnati on Tuesday. He had a chance to see his Facebook page for the first time and wanted to say to everyone ""Hello Hi I am Here and I am on Facebook!!</h3>
<h3><strong>Update October 12th 2012:<span class=""userContent"">Ian was not put under today, he was very happy with that but it meant he had terrible anxiety.We are waiting for his MIBG scan results they will tell us if this may be neroplastoma (cancer) They will be doing a biopsy next week that will be an open surgery not a small needle incision. His liver is hardening and is not full of iron. Mondays MRI was looking at vessel function his blood flow has small changes but over all is normal. next week during the surgery they will also biopsy the tumors on the adrenal gland. the are pretty sure it's the liver causing the fluid build up but they do not know why yet.</span></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><span class=""userContent"">Update Oct 13th 2012:Ian's Grandma arrives today for a weekend visit Ian is very excited. Today Ian will have a full dressing change and a ultra sound of the heart. Delicia is feeling better today she got to have a hot shower.</span></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><span class=""userContent"">UPDATE Oct 13th 2012 Grandma arrived to see Ian and Noah Ian's Brother came along for the trip! Ian had his scan of the heart today and a full dressing change. He said after the dressing change he felt much better. Dr.Lucky allowed Ian to go outside today and get some fresh air. Having Noah to hang out with for Ian was very nice. We have added an update page to Ian's web site. <a href=""http://www.helpian.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.helpian.weebly.com</a>  you can also visit to see the latest pictures. I think it was nice to get out and have a day that was not full of doctors poking at him.</span></strong></h3>
<h3>
<span class=""userContent"">Update 14th Oct 2012::</span><strong><span class=""userContent""> Ian belly and other areas are much larger today. This mean he is retaining more fluid his urine out put is low. They are doing a blader scan now. His day started off well and he had a sleep in but it seems as of now he is retaing the fluid and more then they like. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers. We are very concerned. Grandma and Noah will be staying on over night so Delicia can rest for a bit. They are looking at possiable putting a cathader in now as the swelling is not allowing him to go to the bathroom. Please prayers&gt; I am adding this as Delicia is on the phone with me now. Ian's condition is not improving.</span></strong>
</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""userContent"">Update 15th Oct 2012:</span><strong><span class=""userContent""> they were not able to do Ian's MRI today because his Picc line is not working. They also did not have an EMT team on standby so they will reschedule. Ian was very happy about this. Today Ian received some mail with 2 packages and some cards he was over the moon. I myself was on the phone when they were opened and it was amazing to hear his excitement for sure.</span></strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong><span class=""userContent""><strong>Update 15th Oct 2012:</strong>  Ian's Picc line has been fixed it was not workingdue to this they had to hold off on the MRI today. They also wanted a EMT team on standby and they were not available. The issue with the swelling in the lower belly and groin the doctors believe because Ian was sitting up the fluid had moved down while he was up. That caused pushing on the bladder. This morning that improved and they will not have to put in a cathater at this stage. To much relief of everyone. Ian is passing fluid now. The out put is low but he is doing that on his own. I am trying my best to keep everyone up to date it is very hard as things move so fast one minute its one thing and the next its another. Ian is realy missing his family at home at the moment. His spirits were lifted today when Ian recieved some packages in the mail and some cards. One package included an IPad he was so excited he let out a scream. I was on the phone with him when he recieved it wow he was so Happy!! Easton's dad came over to Ian's room to help Ian set it up. While he was with him they had fixed the Picc line Ian now believes Easton's Dad is his good luck charm!! It was so sweet&gt; Grandma and Noah are staying another night to help out. Ian also recieved a beautiful card today from and little girl and her Mom it was so amazing she sent Ian her hand print a a dollar from her piggy bank to help Ian. Ian and delicia were very touched that is just so wonderful. Thank you all who sent packages and cards and thatnk you all who also helped out with meals. It is a huge help when doctors are coming in and out all the time. Please hang in there I know much like us you are all waiting to find out what is going on with Ian's liver. so to are we this is a long process of getting tests done and back we to very much want answers the doctors are doing all they can for Ian and he is in the best hand. This is very hard on Ian and Delicia, they are missing Emma and Braden Pop Pop and Daddy to and home, the family pets you name it. We do not know how long Ian will be at CCH but by the day the stay is getting longer and longer so we need your support now more then ever.</span></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><span class=""userContent""><strong>Update 16th Oct 1012:</strong> Ian and Delicia are turning in early tonight. Ian is very tired today. He had the chance to go to the play room for a bit but he is iteritated and realy just wants to be left alone at the moment so they decided to go to bed early. The doctors are awaiting test results and scheduling the MRI for maybe the end of the week. They must plan carefully at the moment to ensure the can put Ian under. I am sorry I dont have any more information to share at the moment but we just have not gotten to the bottom of what is going on yet. Ian is on medication to reduce the fluid build up and that is a slow process. When they schedule surgery they hope to take a sample of the fuid to help understand what it is. Again the stay is becoming longer and longer and it is putting lots of presssure on the family financialy as well as emotionaly. Ian is missing his brothers and sister and his Poppop and Daddy to. I know Delicia is very concerned about how they will manage all of this in weeks to come and I know the stress is not helping at the moment please keep them in you thoughts tonight.</span></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><span class=""userContent""><strong>Update 17th Oct 2012</strong>: Ian had his PET scan today. He recieved a package from the Wrightsville Fire &amp; Rescue and was so excited! His school teacher from home called today to line up with the teacher at CCH to help continue with Ian's schooling. He will meet the Cincinnati Childrens Hospital School Teacher tomorrow. Ian is having a lot of pain when having to sit up due to the fluid and it is a real challange for him.They are also helping Ian learn how to deal with anxiety duing bandage changes and tests which is a big help the therpist at CCH is working with him. Ian has gained a pound and a half but at this stage we are unsure if thats good or bad and unsure if thats fluid weight. Hopeing to know more soon as test results come back. Again his stay is getting longer and longer and we need as much help as we can get at the moment if you can donate even a dollar it would be a big help.</span></strong></h3>

<h3>
<span class=""userContent""><span class=""userContent"">I'm still up sitting in the dark eatting a bag of chips and sipping in a juice box. A new medicine they put Ian on has made his belly sick! I hope he rests comfortably. I sit and stare at my baby boy sleeping thinking oh dear lord what is in store for us. How much more can his very frail body take? I keep fighting but really how long can Ian fight? He is so strong but, really all he goes through h</span></span>ow long until he has had enough? Until his body just stops and says no more? How long will we be here weeks months a year? Will Ian ever see home again? It's reality that I'm thinking! I want him healed out of pain smiling! I need thoughts and prayer as these rough times are apon me! I reach for hope keep my faith and just believe that god above will guide me! I have been blessed with a special fighter that has captured hearts of so many. Please continue to share his story and his pain. Educate people on the suffering of these children and their parents. Devistation is in my life and why is it fair that Ian suffers? My heart hurts beyond belief! Butterfly kisses blown over the bed to land softly on his fragile forehead. Rest peaceful my love. Mommy is watching! — with Ian Swarr at Cincinnati Children Hospital.</h3>

<h3><span>Oct 18th 2012 Ian's pain is associated with his tail bone. He has a lot of pain in that area. EB children are prone to fractures in the bones. They will do an x ray some time soon to check it out. Ian has some fractures as it is now in his back again common in EB children. the change in weather also seems to contribute to <br/>his soreness and it has just gotten quite cold in Ohio. His stomach is upset due to medication and he is just feeling bad today. Hope tomorrow is better for him. He recieved a package today from the Noosa Fire Company in Noosa Australia and a <br/>package from a lovley lady named Carol, who sent a portable DVD and some movies for Ian. He was very excited!!

<h3><span><span>Ian had a good time having his family with him. They will be leaving tomorrow afternoon for home. Its been good for Delicia to spend time with her children. Today they went to the zoo. I was upset he could not go but he did not want to get out of bed anyway. His Amonia levels have come down and thats good news. He is stil scheduled for surgery on Thursday so any good news in the lead up  to that it amazing for sure. Grandma and Poppop have been able to give Delicia some time off so thats a good thing.

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"" id=""id_508b35ee64fc32038724249"">
<h3><span class=""userContent""><span class=""userContent"">So today we are up to 5 liters of fluid that have drained from the drainage tube. The fluid keeps coming as the liver is not working well. We still do not have any results yet but we hope to soon at least something. They will look to remove the tube so and put it back in. They can not leave it in because of the risk of infection. and can not move because the drain is just siting in there they can'<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span></span></span></h3>
<h3 class=""text_exposed_show"">t stitch the drain in because of his skin so he is on his back. Being on his back is not a normal position for Ian so he is uncomfortable. We can't do any bandage changes as we can't move so that makes him feel a bit icky. Delicia will change the ones on his legs tonight and that should help a bit. He is not saying much and is not wAnting to eat or drink by mouth because the throat and mouth hurt but that's ok as he is being fed via his feeding tube and is receiving fluids by iv. He is tired to so hoping he rests. He is watching tv. They are working there way thought the packages and cards!! Ian was just over the moon when the mail guy rolled the cart in with the mail. He could not believe it. I will have pictures soon as the day goes on. Delicia is hanging all the cards on wall.She keeps running out of tape there are so many!! They will also be decorating for Halloween tonight as one of the packages received had decorations for him. That will be nice. Delicia told him today after Halloween they can decorate for Christmas and Ian said I won't be here for Christmas and then he said but it feels like Christmas!! So after Halloween they will decorate for Christmas!</h3>

<h3> Oct 27th 2012</h3>
<h3>At this point they have a theory and only a theory. They felt maybe it could be autoimmune there are several types of this. It means the body could be attacking the liver causing damage to the live. This if so is something they can not stop. They have the ability to slow the process however the liver will continue to leak fluid. The live is damaged however the liver enzymes are showing fine. This is confusing for sure. They have many test results that are not back as EB is a very complex thing they will consult on an international level on all results. This is something that CCH has not seen in an EB patient and it could be the case that a doctor somewhere else has.</h3>
<h3>It may be the case this is a first again EB is complex at best. They do not know that this is directly related to EB. It could be contributing but again many unanswered questions. We hope to know more Tuesday about the tumors on the adrenal glands <br/> but the liver will take much long to determine what is really going on. If in fact it is autoimmune the body would continue to destroy the liver and they could only slow the process down in saying that things like liver transplants are not much of an option for Ian and probably would not even be a possibility.</h3>
<h3>I don't even know that there has ever been a transplant on an RDEB patient. That is just getting to far ahead at this stage. What we have to remember is we are only entertaining a theory at this stage we need more results and more answers before anything can really be determined. One thing we do know is the liver continues to leak fluid for some reason and they must look to solve this issue first and in turn they must work out exactly what is going on inside until then we are still no further ahead.</h3>
<h3><strong>Oct 28th 2012</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Ian is feeling good today a bit lazy. Ian's Grandma has now joined us on Facebook woo hoo!! I cant wait to see what comes in the mail for him tomorrow!! We are all just waiting for more results.</strong></h3>
<h3>Update Oct 29th 2012</h3>
<h3><strong><br/>At this point we are still going with liver disease! An auto immune disorder of the liver! There  is inflammation and scarring in the veins that drain the liver. nothing with spleen kidneys skin or liver looks like cancer tests and markers on pathology are not clear. They plan to do an MRI this week, And discuss plan of action! Enzymes are good! Protein was ok today and we are giving vitamin K! So nothing new just wanted to update! We will probably treat with steroids  but again no clue exactly what's going on at this point!<br/><br/>Ian was in a great mood this afternoon he has been on a mental down slide for about an hour he is crying and just wants to be home. With his brothers and sister! Nothing I do or say makes him feel betting! He had visitors that brought him a milk shake and that didn't even help! I'm going to see if he can have something to calm him! It's breaking my heart. I finally went out earlier to get comfy shoes thanks to Amy!</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>Update Oct 30th 2012</strong><br/> Awesome cards art work and gifts today, thank you everyone ! Did a dressing change and overall Ian looks great! The Medihoney has been a blessing now that I have figured out how to go about using it we will always have it on board! He had his 5th albumin infusion today! I can certainly <br/> tell the fluid is building  again but he said he feels good! These nurses sure get a kick out of him! He is a little pistol! Many have commented on the differences over the time we have spent here! With how he looks his color and humor!<br/><br/> We both miss home so much he tells the nurses about daddy and his brothers sister and his animals some of these girls are from the city and think it's hilarious that we have chickens! They even asked if we take them inside when it storms! Lol! We are going to bed I hope to do more laundry tomorrow and find our hospital room there are boxes bags cards dressing supplies and candy everywhere! Gnite</h3>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"" id=""id_5094ce4b622889a67913464"">
<h3><span class=""userContent""><span class=""userContent"">Update: they believe Ian may have Fibrosis of the liver. Tuesday Delicia will have a meeting with the entire team to discuss further. Next week they will look to do an MRI and MRV at this point in time that's all the information we have in. In the coming weeks I am sure they will be discussing treatment and how we will reduce the fluid retention. At this time they are very unsure of what is going <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span></span></span></h3>
<h3 class=""text_exposed_show"">on. it is very frustrating.Ian is now on morphine to manage the pain he is having. His pain has been increasing because he has become very accustomed to the medication on which he has been on so it is proving to be no longer effective for him. he has a very bad wound on his belly that is really irritating him at the moment. This weekend Ian will be very surprised to have 2 of his home nurses visit with him and his Daddy. The only good news I have to share today is that Ian will be given 4 hours to leave the hospital during that time he will be visiting the zoo!! Woo Hoo escape from hospital even if its only for a few hours it will do him a world of good!! I will update as the days go on as we learn more please keep the prayers coming for Ian as his stay becomes longer and longer at CCH.</h3>

</div></div>","Please Help IanMy nephew Ian. What can I say he is the most amazing child I have ever met with the most amazing sense of humor and always greats you with a smile. He is resilient and strong yet every day he faces pain constant pain.Ian has what's known as EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa). you may ask ""what is that""? Well it is an inherited connective tissue disease causing blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.As a result, the skin is extremely fragile. Minor friction or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters. Often referred to as Butterfly Children due to the fact that their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. It's much like a severe burn in Ian's case all over his body. Ian lives in severe pain on constant pain medication to try to help keep him comfortable.  A bump or scratch or even moving the wrong way can case the skin blister and break. It's a constant battle, one area of the skin heals and then blisters again or won't heal at all. Scar tissue develops making it even worse restricting the movement of arms and legs and even opening the mouth. It doesn't stop there, blisters also develop internally in the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. For EB kids the risk of infection is high and can be fatal. Regular bandage changes are required and are nothing short of horrible and extremely painful.In short it is a horrific disease, extremely painful and debilitating. Ian was born with RDEB which is considered to be a severe strain of this disease. Ian is bandaged from head to toe  with blistering and open wounds over most of his body. Ian is unable to walk and is confined to a wheel  chair. Ian can not sit up on his own or dress himself and requires constant care. When born Ian was not given much chance of survival and wasn't expectedto still be with us today. It is a shear miracle Ian is still with us today and has reached the age of 14.87% of children born with one of the more sever forms of EB like Ian's do not live more then 12 months.  Ian enjoys arts and crafts, likes painting and drawing and watching the Food Network on TV. He enjoys spending time with his Brothers and Sister and his little kitten. Ian dreams of being a Firefighter when he grows up. He collects firefighting memorabilia and just loves all things do do with firefighting. He has an amazing attitude for a child who is in so much pain. With all the procedures he has to endure Ian still  manages to retain his sense of humor and I don't know how.Ian had the chance of a life time a few weeks ago to travel to Ohio to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital EB Clinic. The reason for his visit was to tackle the issue of how Ian will be able to eat.  Ian has a feeding tube in his nose which provides him with vital nutrition. However in order to continue to insert a feeding tube every few months Ian has to undergo the procedure of having his esophagus dilated. This is alway a risky procedure as the esophagus is very thin and fragile to start with. Ian has had this procedure so many times it is no longer safe to continue to insert this tube. Without it Ian would be unable to eat and unable to survive. High amounts of nutrition are required to help the body heal the skin and fight infection.His trip to Cincinnati was to hopefully find another way for Ian to be given food. In the past other methods had been tried and failed due to the deterioration of his skin.  Ian's visit was a huge success in one way as the doctors will in the coming weeks be able to dilate his esophagus and remove the tube from his nose. However he will have to under go a surgical procedure to insert a Mickey Button in his belly. At the same time Ian will have to have a total of 10 teeth removed, children with EB often have huge issues with teeth.If that is not enough during his visit to Cincinnati it was discovered that his spleen and liver were enlarged and after further investigation they found 2 tumors one on each adrenal gland. Just when you think it can't get any worse for him, he will now have to have a biopsy to find out what they are before he can have his tube removed, his Mickey button inserted and his teeth pulled.The cost alone of the trips to and from Cincinnati for long periods of time is to much for my sister to endure. Ian being confined to a wheel chair making travel all together difficult. By car it is an 8 hour drive from Pennsylvania to Ohio.  Ian and my sister will have to travel alone to Ohio and stay for long periods of time. Ian has always had trouble in recovering for any procedure and gets very sick after words during this recovery time Ian will not be able to travel home until he is 100%, again making the stays very long.  Ian's brothers and sister have to continue with school and my sisters husband has to continue work to keep the roof over their head and it is going to be impossible for them to manage all this without help. A one income family who is struggling to survive as it is can not possible manage this and that's why we need your help.Our aim is to raise as much as we can to help cover the costs for Ian's trips to Cincinnati Ohio over the next year.Any future medical care for Ian will be address in Cincinnati as they have the specialist with the experience needed to treat Ian. The local hospital where Ian has been treated feels that Ian's medical needs have become to specialized for them to continue to handle. So Ian will now be faced with traveling to Cincinnati for just about everything.We just can't afford to cover the trips to Ohio alone we need to raise as much as we can in a short period of time to help get Ian to Cincinnati. Now that they have discovered the tumors on Ian's adrenal glads he will need to travel soon.The cost of travel, food, accommodation for extended stays will mount quickly and Ian really need your help.If you could find in your heart to help Ian it would mean the world to Ian and his family. Any donation no matter how small can help. If you would like to offer any assistance at all in any way please email at helpian@hotmail.com.We will be posting regular updates on Ian's Facebook Page, Twitter Page & Blog.Facebook: www.facebook.com/ian.swarr.37 please follow Ian's Story.

 Thank You For Taking The Time To Read About IanIan's Aunt Jessica

 
Update Oct 6th 2012 : Ian will be admited to Cincinnati Childrens Hospital on Tuesday. Please keep him in your thoughts! More Updates will be posted here if you would like to check back! Update Oct 7th 2012: Ian was feeling sleepy today but in good spirits! He wants to be sure to get his Halloween costume before he goes to Cincinnati on Tuesday. He had a chance to see his Facebook page for the first time and wanted to say to everyone ""Hello Hi I am Here and I am on Facebook!!
Update October 12th 2012:Ian was not put under today, he was very happy with that but it meant he had terrible anxiety.We are waiting for his MIBG scan results they will tell us if this may be neroplastoma (cancer) They will be doing a biopsy next week that will be an open surgery not a small needle incision. His liver is hardening and is not full of iron. Mondays MRI was looking at vessel function his blood flow has small changes but over all is normal. next week during the surgery they will also biopsy the tumors on the adrenal gland. the are pretty sure it's the liver causing the fluid build up but they do not know why yet.
Update Oct 13th 2012:Ian's Grandma arrives today for a weekend visit Ian is very excited. Today Ian will have a full dressing change and a ultra sound of the heart. Delicia is feeling better today she got to have a hot shower.
UPDATE Oct 13th 2012 Grandma arrived to see Ian and Noah Ian's Brother came along for the trip! Ian had his scan of the heart today and a full dressing change. He said after the dressing change he felt much better. Dr.Lucky allowed Ian to go outside today and get some fresh air. Having Noah to hang out with for Ian was very nice. We have added an update page to Ian's web site. www.helpian.weebly.com  you can also visit to see the latest pictures. I think it was nice to get out and have a day that was not full of doctors poking at him.

Update 14th Oct 2012:: Ian belly and other areas are much larger today. This mean he is retaining more fluid his urine out put is low. They are doing a blader scan now. His day started off well and he had a sleep in but it seems as of now he is retaing the fluid and more then they like. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers. We are very concerned. Grandma and Noah will be staying on over night so Delicia can rest for a bit. They are looking at possiable putting a cathader in now as the swelling is not allowing him to go to the bathroom. Please prayers> I am adding this as Delicia is on the phone with me now. Ian's condition is not improving.


Update 15th Oct 2012: they were not able to do Ian's MRI today because his Picc line is not working. They also did not have an EMT team on standby so they will reschedule. Ian was very happy about this. Today Ian received some mail with 2 packages and some cards he was over the moon. I myself was on the phone when they were opened and it was amazing to hear his excitement for sure.

Update 15th Oct 2012:  Ian's Picc line has been fixed it was not workingdue to this they had to hold off on the MRI today. They also wanted a EMT team on standby and they were not available. The issue with the swelling in the lower belly and groin the doctors believe because Ian was sitting up the fluid had moved down while he was up. That caused pushing on the bladder. This morning that improved and they will not have to put in a cathater at this stage. To much relief of everyone. Ian is passing fluid now. The out put is low but he is doing that on his own. I am trying my best to keep everyone up to date it is very hard as things move so fast one minute its one thing and the next its another. Ian is realy missing his family at home at the moment. His spirits were lifted today when Ian recieved some packages in the mail and some cards. One package included an IPad he was so excited he let out a scream. I was on the phone with him when he recieved it wow he was so Happy!! Easton's dad came over to Ian's room to help Ian set it up. While he was with him they had fixed the Picc line Ian now believes Easton's Dad is his good luck charm!! It was so sweet> Grandma and Noah are staying another night to help out. Ian also recieved a beautiful card today from and little girl and her Mom it was so amazing she sent Ian her hand print a a dollar from her piggy bank to help Ian. Ian and delicia were very touched that is just so wonderful. Thank you all who sent packages and cards and thatnk you all who also helped out with meals. It is a huge help when doctors are coming in and out all the time. Please hang in there I know much like us you are all waiting to find out what is going on with Ian's liver. so to are we this is a long process of getting tests done and back we to very much want answers the doctors are doing all they can for Ian and he is in the best hand. This is very hard on Ian and Delicia, they are missing Emma and Braden Pop Pop and Daddy to and home, the family pets you name it. We do not know how long Ian will be at CCH but by the day the stay is getting longer and longer so we need your support now more then ever.
 
Update 16th Oct 1012: Ian and Delicia are turning in early tonight. Ian is very tired today. He had the chance to go to the play room for a bit but he is iteritated and realy just wants to be left alone at the moment so they decided to go to bed early. The doctors are awaiting test results and scheduling the MRI for maybe the end of the week. They must plan carefully at the moment to ensure the can put Ian under. I am sorry I dont have any more information to share at the moment but we just have not gotten to the bottom of what is going on yet. Ian is on medication to reduce the fluid build up and that is a slow process. When they schedule surgery they hope to take a sample of the fuid to help understand what it is. Again the stay is becoming longer and longer and it is putting lots of presssure on the family financialy as well as emotionaly. Ian is missing his brothers and sister and his Poppop and Daddy to. I know Delicia is very concerned about how they will manage all of this in weeks to come and I know the stress is not helping at the moment please keep them in you thoughts tonight.
Update 17th Oct 2012: Ian had his PET scan today. He recieved a package from the Wrightsville Fire & Rescue and was so excited! His school teacher from home called today to line up with the teacher at CCH to help continue with Ian's schooling. He will meet the Cincinnati Childrens Hospital School Teacher tomorrow. Ian is having a lot of pain when having to sit up due to the fluid and it is a real challange for him.They are also helping Ian learn how to deal with anxiety duing bandage changes and tests which is a big help the therpist at CCH is working with him. Ian has gained a pound and a half but at this stage we are unsure if thats good or bad and unsure if thats fluid weight. Hopeing to know more soon as test results come back. Again his stay is getting longer and longer and we need as much help as we can get at the moment if you can donate even a dollar it would be a big help.
A post from Delica I wanted to share tonight.
 


I'm still up sitting in the dark eatting a bag of chips and sipping in a juice box. A new medicine they put Ian on has made his belly sick! I hope he rests comfortably. I sit and stare at my baby boy sleeping thinking oh dear lord what is in store for us. How much more can his very frail body take? I keep fighting but really how long can Ian fight? He is so strong but, really all he goes through how long until he has had enough? Until his body just stops and says no more? How long will we be here weeks months a year? Will Ian ever see home again? It's reality that I'm thinking! I want him healed out of pain smiling! I need thoughts and prayer as these rough times are apon me! I reach for hope keep my faith and just believe that god above will guide me! I have been blessed with a special fighter that has captured hearts of so many. Please continue to share his story and his pain. Educate people on the suffering of these children and their parents. Devistation is in my life and why is it fair that Ian suffers? My heart hurts beyond belief! Butterfly kisses blown over the bed to land softly on his fragile forehead. Rest peaceful my love. Mommy is watching! — with Ian Swarr at Cincinnati Children Hospital.

Oct 18th 2012 Ian's pain is associated with his tail bone. He has a lot of pain in that area. EB children are prone to fractures in the bones. They will do an x ray some time soon to check it out. Ian has some fractures as it is now in his back again common in EB children. the change in weather also seems to contribute to his soreness and it has just gotten quite cold in Ohio. His stomach is upset due to medication and he is just feeling bad today. Hope tomorrow is better for him. He recieved a package today from the Noosa Fire Company in Noosa Australia and a package from a lovley lady named Carol, who sent a portable DVD and some movies for Ian. He was very excited!! Thank you all for showing support for Ian. Keep the e cards and the mail coming he so enjoys it! If you can donate please do every little bit helps!!
Oct 19th 2012

Ian is not feeling well and depression is starting as he will be away from home so long. Hoping the family visit this weekend will help. They have set a tentative date for surgery for next Thursday and it will be weeks following that maybe even longer that he will be at CCH. Please keep the donations coming they really need the support. He slept most of the day he is still feeling unwell. The GI doctors will visit soon to see what we can do about the medication that is making him unwell.Keep the thoughts and prayers flowing to he needs them.
Update oct 20th 2012: Ian was so happy to see the family today. he is tired and sleeping now Delicia and Troy and the kids will spend the night tonight in a hotel together for some much needed one on one time. Grandma and Popop will stay with Ian tonight. It's been a long day for them all with the drive and I think they all need some rest. I have had over whelming support today from across the world and please know that we are just so touched by every one of you! Ian's power chair is now with him at CCH his grandparents delivered that today as well. He was so happy to have it again as it is his legs!! Lots of love to Easton's Family tonight I thank you guys so much for sharing Ian's story with so many people. Having the family with him this weekend should help so much to lift his spirts for the week ahead it will be a long and hard week with tenative surgery scheduled for Thursday. We still do not know what is happening with his liver and we hope to have more answers at the end of the week again keep the suport coming please Ian's stay is going to be a long one and we need all the support we can get. Big Thank You To Everyone!
Update Oct 21st 2012
Ian had a good time having his family with him. They will be leaving tomorrow afternoon for home. Its been good for Delicia to spend time with her children. Today they went to the zoo. I was upset he could not go but he did not want to get out of bed anyway. His Amonia levels have come down and thats good news. He is stil scheduled for surgery on Thursday so any good news in the lead up  to that it amazing for sure. Grandma and Poppop have been able to give Delicia some time off so thats a good thing. She needs to be with the other kids and her husband Troy they need some time to all catch up. Please keep Ian in your thoughts and prayers this week in the lead up to surgery we are al very concerned as this is going to be hard on him. Its hard for him to recover so send lots of love his way please!
UPDATE OCT 22nd 2012
The family has now left to go back home. Ian was in good spirits today and even ordered himself something to eat. He was sad to see everyone go. They have confirmed they will go ahead with surgery on Thursday and Ian will have the next few days to rest up for the surgery. His ammonia levels are back up again today however they did say it will go up and down.
 
Update 23rd Oct 2012: Ian is having a good day! He is getting ready to get a albumin infusion (protein). He is just going with the flow. His skin looks really good! His ammonia level is better than it has been since we arrived! He gets his biopsy surgery Thursday early morning. As that nears I'm getting anxious just knowing how tight his airway is! We will be in icu at least one night to watch bleeding and vitals closely! His iPad has been keeping him busy! The cord isn't long enough to the outlet and it keeps dying and he doesn't let it charge long enough! I got to meet another eb family today! And have made some friends with other moms that have children here! It's such a depressing place! I talked with a mother who lost her son this morning to cancer! Please just keep all suffering children close to your heart! There is no reason for children to suffer!We have 13 days left on the Indiegogo campaigne and we have not reached our goal yet. Please visit his page and give a donation if you can even if its only a dollar every little bit counts. We will launch another campaign to follow and hope to raise even more for Ian. Please also visit the take them a meals page and sign up days will be added soon!! Thursday is the big day for surgery so please keep the love coming for Ian and pray for a good outcome. Again I want to thank you all so much for the support!!

Ok so 3 really good biopsies of the liver, 2 from adrenal glands one that which bleed slot but they got it stopped. They have already gotten over 3 liters of fluid from him abdomin. The drai age tube will stay in for at least 24 hours! The did 3 punch biopsies! I went in OR to redress him. Lots of new blisters and his mouth to shredded!We are in PICU he is very sleepy I'm going to eat and lay down with him! He says no pain! I had them give him something so he wouldn't  be also zofran as a precaution! Thank you for your prayers by no means are we out of the water we just got in I hope for no bleeding and answers to know what our next step is! Ran back to our other room to get blankets and bumped into baby Liam and his family I will catch up with them hopefully tomorrow if not later tonight 
Update 26th Oct 

So today we are up to 5 liters of fluid that have drained from the drainage tube. The fluid keeps coming as the liver is not working well. We still do not have any results yet but we hope to soon at least something. They will look to remove the tube so and put it back in. They can not leave it in because of the risk of infection. and can not move because the drain is just siting in there they can'...
t stitch the drain in because of his skin so he is on his back. Being on his back is not a normal position for Ian so he is uncomfortable. We can't do any bandage changes as we can't move so that makes him feel a bit icky. Delicia will change the ones on his legs tonight and that should help a bit. He is not saying much and is not wAnting to eat or drink by mouth because the throat and mouth hurt but that's ok as he is being fed via his feeding tube and is receiving fluids by iv. He is tired to so hoping he rests. He is watching tv. They are working there way thought the packages and cards!! Ian was just over the moon when the mail guy rolled the cart in with the mail. He could not believe it. I will have pictures soon as the day goes on. Delicia is hanging all the cards on wall.She keeps running out of tape there are so many!! They will also be decorating for Halloween tonight as one of the packages received had decorations for him. That will be nice. Delicia told him today after Halloween they can decorate for Christmas and Ian said I won't be here for Christmas and then he said but it feels like Christmas!! So after Halloween they will decorate for Christmas!

 Oct 27th 2012
At this point they have a theory and only a theory. They felt maybe it could be autoimmune there are several types of this. It means the body could be attacking the liver causing damage to the live. This if so is something they can not stop. They have the ability to slow the process however the liver will continue to leak fluid. The live is damaged however the liver enzymes are showing fine. This is confusing for sure. They have many test results that are not back as EB is a very complex thing they will consult on an international level on all results. This is something that CCH has not seen in an EB patient and it could be the case that a doctor somewhere else has.
It may be the case this is a first again EB is complex at best. They do not know that this is directly related to EB. It could be contributing but again many unanswered questions. We hope to know more Tuesday about the tumors on the adrenal glands  but the liver will take much long to determine what is really going on. If in fact it is autoimmune the body would continue to destroy the liver and they could only slow the process down in saying that things like liver transplants are not much of an option for Ian and probably would not even be a possibility.
I don't even know that there has ever been a transplant on an RDEB patient. That is just getting to far ahead at this stage. What we have to remember is we are only entertaining a theory at this stage we need more results and more answers before anything can really be determined. One thing we do know is the liver continues to leak fluid for some reason and they must look to solve this issue first and in turn they must work out exactly what is going on inside until then we are still no further ahead.
Oct 28th 2012
Ian is feeling good today a bit lazy. Ian's Grandma has now joined us on Facebook woo hoo!! I cant wait to see what comes in the mail for him tomorrow!! We are all just waiting for more results.
Update Oct 29th 2012
At this point we are still going with liver disease! An auto immune disorder of the liver! There  is inflammation and scarring in the veins that drain the liver. nothing with spleen kidneys skin or liver looks like cancer tests and markers on pathology are not clear. They plan to do an MRI this week, And discuss plan of action! Enzymes are good! Protein was ok today and we are giving vitamin K! So nothing new just wanted to update! We will probably treat with steroids  but again no clue exactly what's going on at this point!Ian was in a great mood this afternoon he has been on a mental down slide for about an hour he is crying and just wants to be home. With his brothers and sister! Nothing I do or say makes him feel betting! He had visitors that brought him a milk shake and that didn't even help! I'm going to see if he can have something to calm him! It's breaking my heart. I finally went out earlier to get comfy shoes thanks to Amy!

Update Oct 30th 2012 Awesome cards art work and gifts today, thank you everyone ! Did a dressing change and overall Ian looks great! The Medihoney has been a blessing now that I have figured out how to go about using it we will always have it on board! He had his 5th albumin infusion today! I can certainly  tell the fluid is building  again but he said he feels good! These nurses sure get a kick out of him! He is a little pistol! Many have commented on the differences over the time we have spent here! With how he looks his color and humor! We both miss home so much he tells the nurses about daddy and his brothers sister and his animals some of these girls are from the city and think it's hilarious that we have chickens! They even asked if we take them inside when it storms! Lol! We are going to bed I hope to do more laundry tomorrow and find our hospital room there are boxes bags cards dressing supplies and candy everywhere! Gnite
 Update Oct 31st 2012 Halloween Update from DeliciaGood morning and Happy Halloween , I tossed and turned all night, he was pretty noisy while sleeping he is still asleep, he will get up soon and get his torso changed. I will get a pic with him and his nurse today! Beth is a vintage nurse today she is terribly cute as always!Ian has realized we won't be hone for his brothers and sisters bdays! He cried its been kinda a rough afternoon I think we might eat watch a movie and veg! I try and stay so strong and bit cry in front if him it has not been easy!We will defiantly need to have Joanne and Jared come up more often (danielle was on Paci duty) Ian is so pleasant now! Thank you! We enjoy your family so much! Joanne you were so right when you said Easton and Ian are tied together for life! Our families will forever be together!Update Aunt JessBoth Ian and Delicia are having a hard time at the moment being away from home and the family is very hard. Each day gets harder and harder. Its also very hard on the family at home to. We hope to make the next few weekends as special as we can with family to visit. Please eep the thoughts and prayers flowing during the hard times.It is a huge financial strain as well and that alone makes it even harder. Your suport is needed during this time please visit Ian's Fundraising page and help out if you can it would mean the world to all of us!
Update November 1st 2012Ian had a good day today for the most part. The Picc line was not working again and they were working hard to fix it. Ian got lots of mail today and a Furbie!! He was thrilled. Still no word on test results at this satge. He could not go to be untill he had some coco pops! Delicia had to go down and see if she could find some she returned moments later with coco crisps, will have to do!
 Update November 2nd 2012


Update: they believe Ian may have Fibrosis of the liver. Tuesday Delicia will have a meeting with the entire team to discuss further. Next week they will look to do an MRI and MRV at this point in time that's all the information we have in. In the coming weeks I am sure they will be discussing treatment and how we will reduce the fluid retention. At this time they are very unsure of what is going ...
on. it is very frustrating.Ian is now on morphine to manage the pain he is having. His pain has been increasing because he has become very accustomed to the medication on which he has been on so it is proving to be no longer effective for him. he has a very bad wound on his belly that is really irritating him at the moment. This weekend Ian will be very surprised to have 2 of his home nurses visit with him and his Daddy. The only good news I have to share today is that Ian will be given 4 hours to leave the hospital during that time he will be visiting the zoo!! Woo Hoo escape from hospital even if its only for a few hours it will do him a world of good!! I will update as the days go on as we learn more please keep the prayers coming for Ian as his stay becomes longer and longer at CCH.",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

project that brings sports like ultimate to public schools in Medellin, 
Colombia, as a vehicle for social change. We were immediately 
fascinated by ultimate because of the fact that it was a non-contact 
sport and there were so many different ways that the disc could be 
thrown. We began to train intensively and often stayed after class to 
throw on our own time. After seeing their passion for the sport, our coach encouraged them to try out for the competitive INDER team, which we did, passing the cuts and eventually making the travelling team, 
where we began to travel to various tournaments around the region.</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453506131/xsgc5bdwntixwtsknrgu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>At the age of 9, we began to train with Revolution Ultimate 
Club, which we remain a part of today. In 2010, at 11 years of age and
 with only three years of experience playing ultimate under their belts, we helped Revolution to a Colombian women's national championship, 
which our team repeated the subsequent year.</p><p>In 2012, the we were selected for the Colombian Women's U19 team
 and gained our  first international experience in Dublin, Ireland, at 
the 2012 World Junior Ultimate Championships. Despite being the youngest
 members of the team, we helped lead our squad
 to a gold medal finish. This trip was the ""greatest 
experience of their lives"". 50% of our travel and tournament costs 
were subsidized by INDER.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453506176/uzf4e0ceesukyuchtoop.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>In 2013, we graduated from the INDER program and began

project that brings sports like ultimate to public schools in Medellin, 
Colombia, as a vehicle for social change. We were immediately 
fascinated by ultimate because of the fact that it was a non-contact 
sport and there were so many different ways that the disc could be 
thrown. We began to train intensively and often stayed after class to 
throw on our own time. After seeing their passion for the sport, our coach encouraged them to try out for the competitive INDER team, which we did, passing the cuts and eventually making the travelling team, 
where we began to travel to various tournaments around the region.At the age of 9, we began to train with Revolution Ultimate 
Club, which we remain a part of today. In 2010, at 11 years of age and
 with only three years of experience playing ultimate under their belts, we helped Revolution to a Colombian women's national championship, 
which our team repeated the subsequent year.In 2012, the we were selected for the Colombian Women's U19 team
 and gained our  first international experience in Dublin, Ireland, at 
the 2012 World Junior Ultimate Championships. Despite being the youngest
 members of the team, we helped lead our squad
 to a gold medal finish. This trip was the ""greatest 
experience of their lives"". 50% of our travel and tournament costs 
were subsidized by INDER.In 2013, we graduated from the INDER program and began 
to dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to Revolution. They traveled with 
the team in July to the U.S. Open, where they gained their first 
experience playing in the United States, coming in fifth place. They 
also led Revolution to another Colombian Women's championship.In 2014, we realized our dream of playing in two worlds - WJUC and WUGC in Lecco, Italy, and won yet another Colombian Women's championship.In 2015, we repeated as national champions with Revolution and travelled to compete in Mexico for the first time, where we won a Pan-American Championship over Madison Heist in a hard-fought final.This year, our dream is to travel to London and Poland to represent our country in the World Ultimate and Guts Championships and World Junior Ultimate Championships.Message Trainer Hi guys my name is Mauricio Moore and I’m the coach of the Women’s elite Ultimate Team for the 2016 WUGC and head coach of Juniors Team for the 2016 WJUC which will take place in London UK, and Worclaw, Poland, in the next summer.

Wake Up, Eat Well, Feel Good
No more messy mixes. Wake Up Waffles are the healthiest, highest protein waffles available. Just pop them in the toaster or microwave and you are ready to go!

Why Wake Up Waffles?
The Problem
Eating healthy on the go is never an easy task. Fast and healthy  are two words that do not go hand-in-hand.
If you want a high protein, low fat meal in the morning preparation needs to start early.

Or you can choose to drink a protein shake or bar. We all know how those feel on an empty stomach...
 
The Solution
Nicole and  I (Keegan) started making our high protein waffles about two years ago when we were first beginning our fitness journeys.
We still wanted to have all the fun of delicious breakfast foods; but most pancake, waffle, or french toast options are packed with sugar. The high protein options are overpriced and tasted a little too ""healthy"" for Nicole and I. That is when Wake Up Waffles were born.

 It took many attempts but we finally figured out a recipe that was

low fat
high protein

not dry (our original goal was to not get hiccups)
didn't taste terrible

and ever since we have been eating our waffles almost every day.
They are great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even as a snack. You can eat them plain or top them off with anything you can think of!

Our main goals are to...

We set our funding goal at $50,000.

He completed his Cardiology Fellowship at Albert Einstein Medical Center before moving to Clearwater, FL in 1995 to enter private practice at Clearwater Cardiovascular Consultants where he has been working for the past 18 years as a Board Certified physician in Cardiovascular Disease and in Internal Medicine.  </p>
<p>Dr. Hepp has served as the President of the Florida Chapter as The Children’s Heart Foundation and as the former Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Morton Plant Mease Hospitals.   He is currently a Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL.

<p>FRESHY™ is a patented, consumer based product that has been
scientifically proven in multiple, independent laboratory studies to increase
the shelf life of nearly ALL foods and to enhance the flavor and taste of
fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products. Additional studies have shown
that FRESHY™ slows the growth of bacteria and potential microbial pathogens in
the general food supply. As such, FRESHY™ is a discovery that holds promise for
dramatically reducing food spoilage worldwide as well as significantly lowering
the incidence of illness and death from food borne diseases.    </p>
<p>FRESHY™ is a clear poly-carbonate plastic egg shaped device
containing liquid treated with patented energy imprinting technology. The
liquid in FRESHY™ is comprised of natural spring water with a proprietary
combination of minerals to create a unique blend of natural elements. The
contents are all natural, non-toxic and environmentally safe. </p>
<p>The results of FRESHY™ are mind blowing:</p>

<h3>What we want to do with this Technology:</h3>
<p>Please help us use this C5 patented technology, which has created FRESHY™, to mass produce the new imprinted glass items of LPG™.  We are creating a C5 energized glass mug and plate to enhance the flavor and freshness of all of your favorite drinks and foods along with supplying the health benefits of the biotechnologies.  We will call these products TASTY™.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We initially used our food preservation device with the technology.  We have now discovered that we could imprint glass products.  LPG™ products that the C5 biotechnologies have been imprinted on, like TASTY™, systematically controls its environment, reduces oxidation, ethylene gas and retains moisture in food which are the leading factors that foster mold, bacteria, nasty odors and rapid food spoilage in both refrigerators and pantries.</p>
<p>Laboratory tests reveal that TASTY™ accelerates the conversion of glycogen into sugars in fruits and vegetables. This advanced conversion resulted in improved taste, flavor and texture, as well as, maintained moisture and natural color.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The new TASTY™ glass mug will be unique in that it will improve the flavor of any liquids placed in it by either increasing the sweetness profile of the liquids (i.e. fruit juice) or taking the bitterness and edge out of other drinks (i.e. store bought beer).

Why Is This Important?

Eating disorders are life-threatening and the incidences of anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder are increasing at a frightening pace, especially among our youth.


 In United States, 95% of those who have eating disorders (estimated at 20 million women and 10 million men) are between the ages of 12 and 25. (Wade, Keski-Rahkonen, & Hudson, 2011)


In United States, for females aged 14-24, the mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is 12 times higher than the death rate associated with all causes of death. (Sullivan, 1995)


In United States, the incidence of bulimia in 10-39 year old women TRIPLED between 1988 and 1993 (Hoek & van Hoeken, 2003).

Why Peer to Peer?
Research indicates that prevention is more effective when information is presented by peers rather than adults. Peer mentoring offers positive role models for those struggling with disordered eating and body image disturbances. As far as we know, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS WEBSITE THAT OFFERS PEER TO PEER PREVENTION EDUCATION.
Beyond Hunger's Peer Education program has been providing services for over 15 years in the San Francisco Bay Area and we have a team of peers trained and able to present eating disorder prevention information in a youth friendly way.

<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our goal is to make this platform as comprehensive as possible, meaning that everything will be covered as it pertains to your health and well-being. However, if we were to create a platform like this from scratch it would take many years and many million of dollars. </p><p>So our goal is to partner with as many existing software tools/providers as possible to incorporate them directly into BEST.<i>everywhere </i>. But there is a chance that some software providers may not allow us to integrate their tools into our platform. This could be for many reasons, including risk of losing branding, negatively affecting their monetization strategy, or maybe they just don't have an API. </p><p>This would be unfortunate for them because we are striving to make as many people successful from this platform as possible, including these software providers.  <b>Our goal is to drive more users to their software, not compete with it.</b> </p><p>In order to overcome this, we will do the following:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>We will assure providers that their brand will be retained. This way people who are using a specific tool in BEST.<i>everywhere </i>will know who provided it. </li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">If the providers have a monetization strategy they think will be negatively affected, we will strive to incorporate this strategy into BEST.<i>everywhere </i>while still keeping the core tools free for our users. Or we will attempt to figure out a new monetization strategy that will work for everyone.</span></li>
<li>If the provider doesn't have an API we will see if there are any other quick and simple ways we can incorporate their tools. e.g. iframes, RSS feeds, etc.</li>
<li>If a provider doesn't want to partner with us or cannot, we will seek a competing provider who will be willing to.</li>
<li>If we cannot find a partner for a specific tool, we will develop the tool ourselves. For example, if we cannot find a partner who will provide the food journaling aspect, we will develop food journaling ourselves. This is only after all other possibilities are exhausted. </li>
</ul><p>Therefore, in a worse case scenario, we will still get the comprehensive feature set into BEST.<i>everywhere </i>but it may take longer to develop the complete package. In this case, we will develop the most important tools first, which are the coaching tools. This way we can begin virtual coaching our clients as soon as possible. </p><p></p><p>It's important to emphasize that this campaign is a joint effort between 2 companies: <b>Jedi Fitness LLC </b>(dba human@ease),<b> </b>which is owned by Dishan Elise, and <b>Cerybrum Corp, </b>the development company owned by Javan Joel. Dishan and Javan are siblings and they are both passionate about and dedicated to this campaign. Therefore, if a tool will need to be developed, we will get it done! </p><p><br/></p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We appreciate you coming this far! All of us knows or have known someone who suffers from severe health problems due to improper care of themselves. And all of us see the negative impact this has on you, your family, your community, and planet. </p><p>This is a program that really works! It has improved lives tremendously and will continue to do so through the Best.<i>everywhere</i> platform. So please get the word out there to your friends, family, and colleagues. Indiegogo has some great sharing tools that allows you to easily do this. </p><p>Any small effort helps immensely towards the big picture of a healthier, happier planet! </p><p>We thank you for all your help, and wish you the BEST!</p><p><br/></p>

We didn't reach anywhere near our goal so perhaps the world is not ready for BEST.everywhere. 
We still are offering the BEST Plan to people in NYC. For anyone who would like to take part in this life-transforming program, check out our website at:http://www.besteverywhere.meThis is a summary of our entire campaign and what the BEST.everywhere platform is all about. 
Our ""BESTies"" talk about how this program positively changed their lives.
Healthy People = Healthy PlanetOur planet is on life support and it's all your fault! Well, not really all your fault. But accepting responsibility empowers you to change. Most of us know that we're all connected in profound ways. This is not just some new age mumbo-jumbo, even science confirms this reality. The physical, mental, and social well-being of individuals everywhere plays a crucial role in the health of our ecosystem.  Source: Barton and Grant ( a ).Click here to learn more about the global impact of poor health... The fact is,  we want to look good and be healthy but we don't know how to properly take care of ourselves. This not only affects our lives but also the world around us! The main philosophy behind our campaign is that in order to create positive change in our world you must first do it in individual lives. That's why we came up with the ""B.E.S.T. Plan"".What is the B.E.S.T. Plan?B.E.S.T. stands for ""Balance, Energy, Strength, and Tranquility"". It's a comprehensive fitness & wellness program that covers all aspects of your body, mind, and spirit. The reason why the BEST Plan is so successful compared to most programs is that you get a personal human coach that is accountable to your success! The techniques they employ are designed to deal with past conditioning and emotional obstacles related to nutrition so that you can have breakthroughs in the area of your health and well-being.In our BEST Plan we use several different resources to help our ""BESTies"" (BEST plan members) including diet apps, workout tracking programs, scheduling apps, and just plain good 'ol fashioned e-mails. It's a bit messy, but it works!Learn more on how our BEST Plan works. Campaign GoalsThe most important things we aim to accomplish in this campaign is to:1) Make it easier and cleaner for our BESTies to use the tools we provide by combining them into 1 platform which is accessible to them from anywhere. 2) Make the BEST Plan available to everyone, regardless of where they are in the world!3) Allow any fitness studio, trainer, and coach to implement their own wellness program so that all fitness & wellness professionals can benefit from a comprehensive program like this.  
What is BEST.everywhere ?
BEST.everywhere is a comprehensive cloud-based software platform that will integrate already existing resources, online directories, fitness apps, and diet apps into one application. But most importantly, it will be a platform where a live human coach will guide you in creating your own personalized wellness routine and educate you in living this routine for life. If you have a software tool, blog, or website related to fitness & wellness, click here to see how we can work together on integrating this directly into BEST.everywhere. Any features that don't exist will be developed into BEST.everywhere by us. Also, this is not only for our coaches. The technology and tools will be available for any fitness studio, personal trainer, or coach to use with their own clients. See our ""Coaching Tools"" and ""Custom Branded Platform"" Perks.Users will have all their fitness resources in one place with a professional coach guiding them.Click here to see a detailed list of features in BEST.everywhere. An online coaching program will last 12 weeks. It will include:
A personal coach
Body assessments
Progress photo uploads
Weekly group coaching sessions via video chat
Workout scheduling and routines
Nutritional Education and planning
Food journaling and analysis
And more (click to learn more)...
You can use all the tools in BEST.everywhere without the personal coaching aspect for free. This is for tech-savvy people who don't mind learning all the tools that will be provided and who feel that they can manage their fitness & wellness schedule themselves.  Why BEST.everywhere ?There are dozens of fitness programs, thousands of facilities, and hundreds of fitness apps available. But BEST.everywhere includes 2 key components missing from these:

It's fully comprehensive! It's not enough to just eat well, or just do yoga, or just strength-train. To get the most positive results in your life you need a balanced routine that covers all aspects of the intricate, marvelous machine you call your body. 

It includes human guidance. You can sign up for a gym membership, purchase all the fitness apps you can fit onto your smartphone, but that doesn't mean you'll get the results you desire. Why? Because who has time to actually learn how to use these programs?! BEST.everywhere will provide you with a personal human coach who will hold your hand and guide you in achieving your goals. Most importantly, they'll educate you and leave you with tools you can use for life!
Click here for more info on the problems BEST.everywhere solves. What BEST.everywhere is not.It's important to emphasize that this is not another fitness & wellness application or website. Instead, we aim to partner with the best fitness and wellness applications already existing and bring their tools directly into the BEST.everywhere platform. For our software partners, this'll mean more users and greater success for their applications. Our development work in BEST.everywhere will be mostly integrating these existing tools via API's (Application Programming Interfaces) and developing any additional missing features needed to ensure it's a complete program. It is also necessary to emphasize that we're not trying to compete with other coaches and fitness facilities. Instead, we want to be able to create a comprehensive application which any coach, fitness facility, trainer, or expert can use to help the success of their clients (see our ""Coaching Tools"" and ""Custom Branded Platform"" Perks). They'll even be able to use the coaching tools with their own specific program and will not have to use the ""BEST Plan methodology"". The comprehensive tool-set available in BEST.everywhere  is meant to help increase the success of their business and clients. Finally, BEST.everywhere will not force users to follow a specific coaching program. Anybody will be able to create a profile in BEST.everywhere and use the tools to create and manage their own fitness and wellness routine for free!Campaign funds and Perks. All funds from the campaign will be used in the creation of the BEST.everywhere platform as well as the administrative and coaching needed to run it. Costs will include programmers and designers to develop the BEST.everywhere software platform and all ""Custom Branded Platforms"" (see ""Custom Branded Platform"" Perk). Funds will also pay for initial hosting fees for running these platforms. We will also need to cover administrative expenses for support to coaches and facilities who will be using this for their clients. This will also cover the development of a training program for BEST Plan coaches and hiring new coaches. Approximately  60% of the funds raised will go towards development costs while the remaining will be for coaches, training, administrative, hosting, and miscellaneous fees related to this campaign. Development of BEST.everywhere  will proceed once funding is received. It will then take approximately 8 - 12 months to release the first phase of BEST.everywhere, which will be enough to begin the coaching programs. However, BEST.everywhere will be a comprehensive platform that will continually evolve over course of 3 years and beyond. If we don't reach our full goal, we will still develop BEST.everywhere, but it will take longer to develop the full feature set we aim to include. Not reaching our goal will also mean less BEST Plan users to coach so we will naturally need less coaches which means lowered expenses. If we exceed our goal, this will mean that we'll need more coaches for the additional users. Also, it will mean we can hire more developers to develop the platform a lot faster and with more bells and whistles. ""Thank You!"" ($10)To all of you. By helping us bring this campaign to life, it'll bring positive change to the lives of many. To show our appreciation, we'll post your name on the ""thank-you"" page in BEST.everywhere .

Hilary Clinton is known for saying it takes a village to raise a child. 
 
That was true for me for many years. Now days, it is more like it takes  a village to care for our aging parents. 
 
The really cool thing is that a lot of the people who we love in our lives who are older are our friend's parents who we have also known for most of our lives. 
 
For the first time ever, I am faced with a challenge with one of my parents. So I am feeling this first hand ever since my Mom fell. 
 
My Mom is a woman who has spent her entire life raising any kid who needs her.
 
When my closest friends in elementary school's Mom died of MS, my Mom took in the kids for the next 15 years, no questions asked. 
 
We always had at least 3-4 extra kids in the house on top of the 4 of us kids. 
 
She is 72 and is still taking care of the neighbors kids daily for free. My Mom has been by my side every step of the way and is my motivation and rock.  
 
She has a potentially life threatening situation in what Dr. Oz calls the ""triangle of death"". http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/facing-triangle-death 
 
When she fell she landed face down breaking the nerves under her front 4 teeth. They got infected and were treated for the infection with antibiotics. 
 
The infection will come back according to the doctors we have spoken to because there is now necrotic tissue there where the healthy nerves used to be. 
 
Dr. Monte Buck who is an extraordinary dentist has agreed to do the surgery required. http://www.drmbuck.com/MeetDrBuck.aspx
 
I want to raise this money this way and further the conversation that it takes a village to care for our aging parents.

<p><i>Comparing it to a back razor I ordered 5-6 years ago of which I read reviews and watched demo videos of men with really haiiry backs using it successfully, your product blows it out of the proverbial waters. One back razor I used, within a few strokes, ripped my skin to bleeding and the blade clogged rendering it useless. It did not live up to the demos that I watched and the reviews that I read. Your product will take some beating, for sure.</i></p>
<p><i>I like the way your razor can be adjusted with a varying degree of angles which makes the hard to reach spots easy to do. It is also great to shave in any direction, confidently, knowing that chunks of skin are not going to come away from my back and have it look like Freddy Kruger has had some nightmare fun on me!!</i></p>
<p><i>Anyhoo, many thanks for inventing this back shaver, I hope and believe it will be a great seller, not only in the US but I am sure over here in the UK also. I am guessing I am the first bloke outside of your country to try? If so then it is an honor to be the first to use outside of your country!</i></p>

<p>#1-Unmatched Speed: Bidirectional shaving strokes shave faster than singular direction shaving strokes, and OmniShaver's low profile design makes control far superior to leveraged elongated handles, so those are two of the three key reasons why Omnishaver shaves so much faster than all other shavers.</p>
<p>#2-OmniShaver self-cleans during use, so as one side cuts hair, the other side is having it's cut hair pulled from its blades. This makes cleaning or rinsing during a shave unnecessary, which is the third key reasons why Omnishaver shaves so much faster than all other shavers.</p>
<p>#3-Self-Straighten and Polish During Use: We can't really answer how long the blade edges stay sharp, although I can confidently say they will outlast all other shaver's blades. If OmniShaver is kept dry and clean between shaves it doesn't really seem to ever get dull enough to warrant replacement. This is because it's blade edges self-straighten and polish (or ""strop"") during use. Example: My OmniShaver has been providing me with daily close shaves for almost 2 years now...that doesn't mean I'm promising that OmniShaver's blades will stay sharp forever, but if maintained, they will certainly stay sharp far longer than any other shaver's blades stay sharp.</p>
<p>#4-Less skin irritation / cuts / nicks: Skin irritation, nicks and/or cuts usually come from successive passes over skin that's been irritated, OmniShaver requires ""fewer passes"" to shave an area clean and therefore irritates the skin much less. Nicks and/or cuts can also come from dull blade edges being pressed harder to shave ""one-last-time"". OmniShaver’s blades self-straighten and polish during use, so maintaining its sharp edges helps to prevent nicks and/or cuts. The most common cause of nicks and/or cuts with traditional shavers are with their blade heads being tilted by a leveraged handle, which creates uneven angles of blade edge attack to the skin. With OmniShaver's low profile design, the blade head always maintains a parallel downward pressure plane relationship to that of its cutting surface, making angles of blade edge attack consistent throughout the shave. This makes nicks and/or cuts from gouging less likely.</p>

Comparing it to a back razor I ordered 5-6 years ago of which I read reviews and watched demo videos of men with really haiiry backs using it successfully, your product blows it out of the proverbial waters. One back razor I used, within a few strokes, ripped my skin to bleeding and the blade clogged rendering it useless. It did not live up to the demos that I watched and the reviews that I read. Your product will take some beating, for sure.
I like the way your razor can be adjusted with a varying degree of angles which makes the hard to reach spots easy to do. It is also great to shave in any direction, confidently, knowing that chunks of skin are not going to come away from my back and have it look like Freddy Kruger has had some nightmare fun on me!!
Anyhoo, many thanks for inventing this back shaver, I hope and believe it will be a great seller, not only in the US but I am sure over here in the UK also. I am guessing I am the first bloke outside of your country to try? If so then it is an honor to be the first to use outside of your country!
Keep up the good work.

But if maintained, they will certainly stay sharp exponentially longer than all other shavers on the market today. Although individual experiences may vary, OmniShaver feels that if properly maintained and used, our shaver will provide at least twice the number of shaves other shavers or razors can provide.​Approximate Shaving Cost Per Year ($) based on Razorpedia.com survey and a top shaver manufacturer's cartridges purchased at $20 per pack and disposed of every 2 weeks. Our Product is Eco-Friendly in Several Ways:#1- There is no need to rinse OmniShaver’s blades while shaving. According to the EPA, a typical shave will waste 10 gallons of water, so a year’s worth of daily shaves will waste 3,650 gallons of water per person.#2- OmniShaver exponentially outlasts traditional shavers. According to the EPA, about 2 billion shavers are thrown away each year. OmniShaver's use will exponentially decrease that number.#3- We incorporate recycled plastics into our production. Omishaver’s Bi-Directional Blades gives a closer shave with fewer passes.OmniShaver is the only shaver that ""Self Cleans"", meaning that you don't need to stop during your shave to rinse or clean out your shaver. Once the shave is complete, rinse with water.OmniShaver is by far the ""Fastest Way To Shave"". Scalp shaving typically takes from 5-15 minutes but only OmniShaver can shave a full scalp in as little as 37 seconds.         With proper care and maintenance, your OmniShaver should easily provide you with many more uses than other shavers on the market can provide. There are 3 things that will help to extend OmniShaver's useful life. Opposing Blade, Bi-Directional Shaver. Protected by 8 Domestic and 16 International Patents.            OmniShaver has blades, why is it better than other shavers?    
 
#1-Unmatched Speed: Bidirectional shaving strokes shave faster than singular direction shaving strokes, and OmniShaver's low profile design makes control far superior to leveraged elongated handles, so those are two of the three key reasons why Omnishaver shaves so much faster than all other shavers.
#2-OmniShaver self-cleans during use, so as one side cuts hair, the other side is having it's cut hair pulled from its blades. This makes cleaning or rinsing during a shave unnecessary, which is the third key reasons why Omnishaver shaves so much faster than all other shavers.
#3-Self-Straighten and Polish During Use: We can't really answer how long the blade edges stay sharp, although I can confidently say they will outlast all other shaver's blades. If OmniShaver is kept dry and clean between shaves it doesn't really seem to ever get dull enough to warrant replacement. This is because it's blade edges self-straighten and polish (or ""strop"") during use. Example: My OmniShaver has been providing me with daily close shaves for almost 2 years now...that doesn't mean I'm promising that OmniShaver's blades will stay sharp forever, but if maintained, they will certainly stay sharp far longer than any other shaver's blades stay sharp.
#4-Less skin irritation / cuts / nicks: Skin irritation, nicks and/or cuts usually come from successive passes over skin that's been irritated, OmniShaver requires ""fewer passes"" to shave an area clean and therefore irritates the skin much less. Nicks and/or cuts can also come from dull blade edges being pressed harder to shave ""one-last-time"". OmniShaver’s blades self-straighten and polish during use, so maintaining its sharp edges helps to prevent nicks and/or cuts. The most common cause of nicks and/or cuts with traditional shavers are with their blade heads being tilted by a leveraged handle, which creates uneven angles of blade edge attack to the skin. With OmniShaver's low profile design, the blade head always maintains a parallel downward pressure plane relationship to that of its cutting surface, making angles of blade edge attack consistent throughout the shave. This makes nicks and/or cuts from gouging less likely.
 

 How Long Do the Blades Last?    Although there is not a clear answer, how long the blade edges stay sharp, we can confidently say they will outlast all other shavers you've ever tried. If OmniShaver is kept dry and clean between shaves it doesn't really seem to ever get dull enough to warrant replacement. This is because it's blade edges straighten and polish (or ""strop"") during use. Example: My OmniShaver has been providing me with daily close shaves for almost 2 years now...that doesn't mean I'm promising that OmniShaver's blades will stay sharp forever, but if maintained, they will certainly stay sharp far longer than any other shaver's blades stay sharp. Can the OmniShaver only be used on the scalp?   This particular model of OmniShaver is specifically designed for the scalp, legs, arms back and torso. It’s shaving head is too large to be used for the face. The new facial OmniShaver is being designed and will be released soon. How Long Do the Blades Last?    Definition of Stropping - (Verb) The act of making a blade sharp or sharper in conjunction with the use of a “strop” (or leather strap). We can't really answer how long the OmniShaver’s blade edges stay sharp. Although we can confidently say they will outlast all other known shaver’s blades’ edges. If OmniShaver is kept dry and clean between shaves, it stays sharp for an extremely long time. This is because its' blade edges self-straighten and polish (or “strop”) during use.Example: One OmniShaver we’ve tested has been providing its user with daily close shaves in excess of 2 years. That doesn't mean we’re promising OmniShaver’s blades will stay sharp forever. But if maintained, they will certainly stay sharp exponentially longer than all other shavers on the market today. Can the OmniShaver only be used on the scalp?This particular model of OmniShaver is specifically designed for the scalp, legs, arms back and torso. Its shaving head is too large to be used for the face. The new facial OmniShaver is being designed and will be released soon. Will OmniShaver Cut Me?    
 
Nicks and/or cuts usually come from successive passes over skin that's been irritated. OmniShaver requires fewer passes and therefor irritates the skin less. Nicks and/or cuts can also come from dull blade edges being pressed harder to shave ""one-last-time"". OmniShaver’s blades’ self-straighten and self-polish during use, so maintaining it's sharp edges helps to prevent nick and/or cut problems. The most common cause of nicks and/or cuts with traditional shavers are with their blade heads being tilted by a leveraged handle, which creates uneven angles of blade edge attack to the skin. With OmniShaver, the blade head always maintains a parallel downward pressure plane relationship to that of it's cutting surface, making angles of blade edge attack consistent throughout the shave. This makes nicks and/or cuts from gouging less likely.
 If I cut myself or my skin becomes irritated with a rash or bump what do I do?    
There are only a few ways that blades typically snag on hair, and that is if they are dull, damaged, if there isn't enough lubrication or if the hair being shaved is a bit too long.
 
#1-Dull: There is a fix to this because the blades self-straighten and polish (or ""strop"") during use, so to tune them up, pick a 6"" or 7"" patch of hairless skin, like maybe on your forearm, lubricate it with hair conditioner and make 30 or so fast back and forth shaving passes over it. This should re-polish the blade edges for future use.
 
#2-Damaged: Look closely at the blade edges and see if you can detect any kinks or bends. Also, look at the bands on the ends of the blades to see if one is broken or if it has a sharp area sticking up. There is no solution if it's damaged.
 
#3-We're sure you are using good lubrication, but maybe instead try using a generous amount of hair conditioner because we've found that's one of the best lubrication.
 
#4-Give shaving a try with only 1 day of hair growth, then if no problems, try 2 days and then 3 days to see if hair length is a contributing factor.#5-Apple Cider Vinegar is a great anti-inflammation remedy...just wipe it on any irritated skin (like razor burn or razor bumps) to help in aiding a speedy recovery.
 Why doesn’t OmniShaver have any lubrication strips?    
The strips are acknowledged by most manufacturers as a gimmick because shaving gels and lotions provide plenty of lubrication during a shave. If OmniShaver needed lubrication strips they would not be incorporated into the product, but the reason they are not used is that they are designed to last about a week, and because OmniShaver lasts for months and months, it wouldn't make sense to incorporate them into OmniShaver's design.
 
#1-Try using a shaving foam/lotion or gel that's designed for ""sensitive"" skin.
 
#2-Buy some Apple Cider Vinegar and after your shave, wipe it over the area you typically get the razor burn or razor bumps.
 
#3-This one is the most important: Omnishaver shaves so well that you only need to go over a specific area with a few backs and forth strokes. Many go over areas WAY too many times, or they will keep coming back to an area over and over, and that just sands your skin away. Shave an area clean and then move on to another, and then another until finished.
 
#4-Shave every day, then you'll get used to the movements, and fewer strokes will be needed to keep your scalp shaved. Fewer strokes = less chance for skin irritation.
 I have Alopecia, is OmniShaver OK to use?    People with Alopecia often report having extremely sensitive skin. Full disclosure, OmniShaver is a bladed razor so it can be abrasive but less abrasive than a regular razor because it requires half as many stroking passes to shave an area clean. Fewer passes equal fewer opportunities for skin irritation. Does OmniShaver come in any other colors?    OmniShaver will be offered in numerous other colors by Fall of 2018.",48.0,10,"1 Campaign

Falls are the second leading cause of accidental injury deaths worldwide. Each year, an estimated 424,000 individuals die from falls globally (World Health Organization). Severe falls that require medical attention number to about 37 million each year. Despite these numbers, however, studies show that majority of serious consequences are not directly caused by falling, but are due to delayed assistance and treatment.


GRVTY Smart Fitness Band detects changes in an individual’s motion and body position, while algorithmically analyzing whether or not the person is accidentally falling. If the individual does fall,  GRVTY prompts a wireless transmitter to issue an alert through smart phones or desktops, tablets for quick response by providing the person’s location. Thus, it is easy to locate and help those who are wearing the smart band in life-threatening emergencies.


Such feature greatly cuts response time and serious complications brought by improper handling of injured individuals.

                       



Road traffic death occurs 1.24 million times per year. And texting while driving has now replaced drunk driving as the leading cause of accidents and deaths among teenage drivers (Transport Research Laboratory).  More alarmingly, over 50 percent of adults admitted that they have texted while driving. Such habit poses dangers as studies show that drivers who text are 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash compared to those who do not.

  

GRVTY knows if the wearer is texting while driving by analyzing motions of arms and hands, speed and smart phone use.  It can also detect driving habits like weaving, frequent swerving, sudden acceleration and stops. These are typically related to distracted driving due to texting. 


GRVTY detects these dangerous motion patterns and nudges the wearer with a vibration. This feature can avert possible accidents by alerting drivers of the dangers posed by their actions.



GRVTY keeps track of driving history and its learning algorithms turn data into actionable insights about driver safety.  It shares the information to the wearer while providing risk assessment of the person’s driving.  The driver can review the data and make personal adjustments to improve his/her driving.


In case of vehicular crash, GRVTY automatically  alerts emergency contacts for immediate response or rescue. The smart band sends out the distress call even if the wearer becomes unconscious or badly wounded.
                       


GRVTY is a fitness band that can monitor one’s exercise regimen, heart rate and sedentary habits.  It can alert the wearer to  encourage movement and motion with a vibration.


Sports enthusiasts will surely benefit from information on pulse rate, estimated calories burned and number of steps taken. The health buff can monitor his/her progress based on recorded hours of activity and inactivity.





                   
GRVTY Smart Fitness Wearable evaluates motion using accelerometers connected to a commercially-available micro controller.  The microprocessor receives input from the accelerometers and transmits the acceleration data to the user’s mobile device app.  GRVTY measures and records the acceleration along the x, y and z-axes when attached to the wearer's arm.
GRVTY reacts depending on the processed data.  A combination of frequency, duration, intensity, and patterns of movement can signal GRVTY to alert the wearer through a vibration or to send out an emergency message to authorities.


                                        

GRVTY makes full use of available technology by partnering the smart wearable with its very own GRVTY APP.


GRVTY App keeps a record of the wearer’s driving habits, then analyzes and correlates them with distracted driving patterns. The GRVTY App, then, provides a risk assessment to inform whether or not the wearer is a safe driver.

<h2>U-GYM PRO Deep Tissue Muscle Massager</h2>
<h3>Enhance Exercise Whenever Wherever</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489336207/qglpuwycrfuwtefkfnfy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>- Relax deeper layer of muscle instantly<br/>- Enhance exercise and recovery efficiency<br/>- Portable solution designed to use on the spot</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>U-GYM Pro Deep Layer Muscle Massager</u></strong> is a smart and portable accessory designed for active exercise enthusiasts to get professional and effective massage on the go. It can help resolve muscle stiffness and soreness for different types of sports to improve exercise performance, speed up muscle recovery and prevent potential sport injury.</p>
<p><u><strong>Before exercise – Body warm up</strong></u><br/>Busy modern people understand the importance of exercise can help them keep figure and reduce stress from work. However, with their hectic working schedule, the warm-up before every exercise is often neglected. To do high intensity aerobic directly without warm-up may cause muscle tear, sprain or overuse. Now with U-GYM Pro, you can do the warm-ups on the way to GYM. It’s small and easy to carry around with you allowing users to relax stiff muscle before doing heavy workout. Making every fractured time counts to avoid any possible sport injury.</p>
<p><u><strong>During exercise – Enhance or assist training</strong></u><br/>When developing or training certain area of muscles, you can use U-GYM Pro to train other areas at the same time for better workout efficiency. For example, you can use U-GYM Pro to train abdomen area while doing speed walking to enhance exercise efficiency. This can not only do abs while walking but also force you to use abdomen muscle to lift legs and reduce possible injuries of thigh and kneel.</p>
<p><u><strong>After exercise – Relax muscle and metalize chemical</strong></u><br/>To speed up muscle recovery and avoid soreness caused by chemical developing in muscle after an intensive and exhausting exercise, you can use U-GYM Pro to massage focusing on certain areas of muscle to help chemical metabolized and reduce discomfort from muscle soreness.</p>
<p><u><strong>No time to exercise?</strong></u><br/>Sometimes life is just way ahead and we can hardly catch up to spare 30 minutes for exercise. However, U-GYM Pro can be a good substitute to passively massage and exercise your muscle to help consume calories, enhance or keep muscle strength. Embedded 3200mA Lithium Polymer battery can use up to 10 hours with one single charge, allowing users to utilize fractured time while walking, commuting or taking break to relax muscle on the spot, keep the good exercise habit going.</p>

<h1><b>Story Behind U-Gym</b></h1>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476621352/b86v2v211mel5p0qf277.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When U-Gym founder and CEO Mark received hospital rehabilitation for a shoulder injury three years ago, he discovered that professional electrotherapy is painless and very effective. However, it’s time consuming for going back and forth and inconvenient for making appointments. For that reason, Mark started to study middle frequency stimulation and possibly design a portable device. </p>
<p>Besides, while developing middle frequency electrotherapy, chief executive of technology CC had to try different stimulation types and therapy modes personally and he unexpectedly lost 12.3 lbs in two months. As a result, we found out electrotherapy can be helpful not only in treating pain or illness but also in managing weight effectively. </p>

<h1><b>The Impact</b></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>We strongly believe U-Gym (Smart Mobile Health Enhancer) campaign can help many people enhance their health with less effort. U-Gym can help people save not only much time but lots of money.As a very practical and convenient health-enhancing device, it will undoubtedly make a very positive impact on modern people’s lives in the hustling and bustling world.</p>
<p>Therefore, your support to this campaign is definitely significant because your contribution will make it possible for U-Gym to become available and affordable for the young and the old alike in the near future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h1>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our team members including CC, Marty, CM and me all have had many years of experience in electronic and semiconductor industries in Taiwan. Since Taiwan is famous for being able to make such superb products as Apple’s iPhone, we believe it is an ideal base for us to undertake the U-Gym project.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>INJECTION MOLDING</i></p>
<p><span>For the purpose of making perfect parts, we have decided to produce our parts by means of injection molding. There is typically a 60-day lead time to fabricate the molds and every fine adjustment after each mold test run will extend additional two weeks. This is where the delays may occur and could possibly spin out of control. That is why we put our own money in molding before the campaign starts to minimize more variation of delays.</span></p>
<p><i>SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS</i><br/>In order to minimize the possible delay of certain key components such as Lithium Polymer battery, we have adjusted our design so as to fit four different sizes of batteries from four different manufacturers.</p>
<p>For some custom made parts like converter, due to long lead time and the need for larger quantity, we have started the ordering process for the estimated quantity by putting in our own money before the campaign commenced. This will minimize the possible delay if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>For other common parts, we have also started the Quality Assurance procedure by making test equipment to examine incoming components and sub-assembled module. Without letting our manufacturer tell us what's good or bad, we have years of experience in developing and producing consumer electronics (eg. laptop, mini servers and communication modules). So we know what we are doing and are confident in dealing with whatever possible risks throughout the manufacturing process.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><b>Certification</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to deliver U-Gym, certain certifications in the respective markets are required. Thus we have started to prepare documents and samples and work closely with the consulting company specializing in international certification procedures for medical appliances.</p>
<p>The manufacturers we employ in Taiwan are GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certified and they have experience in manufacturing medical devices, particularly muscle stimulator. Besides, we will have FCC and CE certificates ready for bluetooth connectivity before the delivery.</p>
<p>Although we are confident and well prepared to handle all the respective processes, we cannot eliminate the risk of possible delays due to compliance issues. If we should encounter any unexpected problems, we will try our best to fulfill your order.</p>

<h1><b>Safety and Precaution</b></h1>
<p>U-Gym is suitable for use by all adults. However, as with all forms of exercise, some care is needed when using them, so please bear in mind the points below and do not use U-Gym if:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>You have an electronic implant (eg. cardiac pacemaker) or suffer from other heart problem.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>You are pregnant.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>You suffer from cancer, epilepsy or are under medical supervision for cognitive dysfunction.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>You are connected to high-frequency surgical equipment.</p>
<p>·<span>  There are a number of illness not suitable to use U-Gym. </span>Please consult with physician if you are not certain about your condition.</p>
<p>·  Remember to seek professional advice if you feel uncertain in any way after using U-Gym. It's always good to let your doctor know your progress at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><b>FAQs</b></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Q1. Your product is categorized as medical device, so do you have any compliance and qualification?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A1. We understand your concern. Basically our product is designed on the basis of a professional electrotherapy device and we will implement all safety measures and protections in case of any mis-operation. In addition, we plan to apply to major countries for FDA compliance and other necessary certifications once we have more prototype on hand. We have consulted with Emergo Group who is specialized in helping companies to get approved. That is why we need to raise a fund on Indiegogo to build more products and cover the expense of multiple applications. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q2. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I’m trying to compare the difference between your U-Gym and other portable TENS or EMS machines. Does the U-Gym stimulate muscle in a way that other similar equipment does not? </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What is the reason is the price much lower in Taiwan?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A2. The most differences between U-GYM and other portable machines are the operating frequency, multiple interferential waveforms and stimulation intensity. Most machines out there still focus on one or two indications but we aim to make U-GYM a multi-purpose device by making it “user programmable”.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">People utilize electrotherapy technology for decades, consequently there are many different types of devices on the market. In addition, Taiwan is home of OEM and ODM manufacturers for many name-brand electro-stimulator companies, such as Antelope Suit, Slendertone, OSIM and Omron. For those reasons, the devices are seemly cheaper in Taiwan and China. However, there are not much improvement in design and functionality albeit many years of evolvement, and most portable stimulation devices still look similar and have limited functions. </span></p>
<p>U-GYM uses the latest technology and advanced components to make it effective, portable and programmable. We even have to customized and design our own components to match our designs. Thus the cost for producing U-GYM is much higher than we expected. We hope you will enjoy the benefits U-GYM brings you and we look forward to more feedbacks.</p>

It can help resolve muscle stiffness and soreness for different types of sports to improve exercise performance, speed up muscle recovery and prevent potential sport injury.
Before exercise – Body warm upBusy modern people understand the importance of exercise can help them keep figure and reduce stress from work. However, with their hectic working schedule, the warm-up before every exercise is often neglected. To do high intensity aerobic directly without warm-up may cause muscle tear, sprain or overuse. Now with U-GYM Pro, you can do the warm-ups on the way to GYM. It’s small and easy to carry around with you allowing users to relax stiff muscle before doing heavy workout.

For example, you can use U-GYM Pro to train abdomen area while doing speed walking to enhance exercise efficiency. This can not only do abs while walking but also force you to use abdomen muscle to lift legs and reduce possible injuries of thigh and kneel.
After exercise – Relax muscle and metalize chemicalTo speed up muscle recovery and avoid soreness caused by chemical developing in muscle after an intensive and exhausting exercise, you can use U-GYM Pro to massage focusing on certain areas of muscle to help chemical metabolized and reduce discomfort from muscle soreness.
No time to exercise?Sometimes life is just way ahead and we can hardly catch up to spare 30 minutes for exercise. However, U-GYM Pro can be a good substitute to passively massage and exercise your muscle to help consume calories, enhance or keep muscle strength. Embedded 3200mA Lithium Polymer battery can use up to 10 hours with one single charge, allowing users to utilize fractured time while walking, commuting or taking break to relax muscle on the spot, keep the good exercise habit going.

More Innovations
With embedded Lithium Polymer rechargeable battery UGYM Pro can continuously operate for up to 8 hours with one charge and can be used as a power bank.

How does U-Gym work?
 

 
Unlike most portable electrotherapy devices operating below 1,000Hz with single waveform, U-Gym can operate in a wide range of frequencies and multiple waveforms concurrently. With advanced hardware design and chip integration, our device can operate multiple interferential waveforms from TENS, FES, EMS and even METS with frequency up to 10,000Hz.
U-Gym uses electric current to stimulate the nerves, causing muscles to contract and induce the effect of passive workout accordingly, which can, in turn, help improve blood circulation and manage weight by consuming calories more efficiently. 

 
Story Behind U-Gym

When U-Gym founder and CEO Mark received hospital rehabilitation for a shoulder injury three years ago, he discovered that professional electrotherapy is painless and very effective. However, it’s time consuming for going back and forth and inconvenient for making appointments. For that reason, Mark started to study middle frequency stimulation and possibly design a portable device. 
Besides, while developing middle frequency electrotherapy, chief executive of technology CC had to try different stimulation types and therapy modes personally and he unexpectedly lost 12.3 lbs in two months. As a result, we found out electrotherapy can be helpful not only in treating pain or illness but also in managing weight effectively. 
 
 
What PERKs can you get?

 
U-GYM uses many latest and advanced IC components and parts, and we need to buy them in volume to bring down the cost. We need your support to make U-Gym available and affordable to help more people get healthier and improve their lives.
The money will go to injection molding, PCB boards, LED components, production equipment and other customized parts. If we can raise adequate funds,we also plan to keep developing better stimulation programs for upgrading the quality of U-Gym as a whole.
Furthermore, we need to allot a portion of the funds to be raised for acquiring certifications from country to country and providing safe and regulated products. In addition, we are working with hospitals, retirement homes and gyms to get direct users feedback to help us perfect our products in the future.
To express our gratitude for your kind support, we will be pleased to provide you with our first generation products of U-Gym as perks. As we are working on the finishing touch for our products and stimulation programs, your constructive comments and suggestions will be deeply appreciated.

The Impact
 
We strongly believe U-Gym (Smart Mobile Health Enhancer) campaign can help many people enhance their health with less effort. U-Gym can help people save not only much time but lots of money.As a very practical and convenient health-enhancing device, it will undoubtedly make a very positive impact on modern people’s lives in the hustling and bustling world.
Therefore, your support to this campaign is definitely significant because your contribution will make it possible for U-Gym to become available and affordable for the young and the old alike in the near future.
 
Risks & Challenges
Our team members including CC, Marty, CM and me all have had many years of experience in electronic and semiconductor industries in Taiwan. Since Taiwan is famous for being able to make such superb products as Apple’s iPhone, we believe it is an ideal base for us to undertake the U-Gym project.
 
INJECTION MOLDING
For the purpose of making perfect parts, we have decided to produce our parts by means of injection molding. There is typically a 60-day lead time to fabricate the molds and every fine adjustment after each mold test run will extend additional two weeks. This is where the delays may occur and could possibly spin out of control. That is why we put our own money in molding before the campaign starts to minimize more variation of delays.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICSIn order to minimize the possible delay of certain key components such as Lithium Polymer battery, we have adjusted our design so as to fit four different sizes of batteries from four different manufacturers.
For some custom made parts like converter, due to long lead time and the need for larger quantity, we have started the ordering process for the estimated quantity by putting in our own money before the campaign commenced. This will minimize the possible delay if anything goes wrong.
For other common parts, we have also started the Quality Assurance procedure by making test equipment to examine incoming components and sub-assembled module. Without letting our manufacturer tell us what's good or bad, we have years of experience in developing and producing consumer electronics (eg. laptop, mini servers and communication modules). So we know what we are doing and are confident in dealing with whatever possible risks throughout the manufacturing process.
 
  
Certification
 
In order to deliver U-Gym, certain certifications in the respective markets are required. Thus we have started to prepare documents and samples and work closely with the consulting company specializing in international certification procedures for medical appliances.
The manufacturers we employ in Taiwan are GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certified and they have experience in manufacturing medical devices, particularly muscle stimulator. Besides, we will have FCC and CE certificates ready for bluetooth connectivity before the delivery.
Although we are confident and well prepared to handle all the respective processes, we cannot eliminate the risk of possible delays due to compliance issues. If we should encounter any unexpected problems, we will try our best to fulfill your order.

Safety and Precaution
U-Gym is suitable for use by all adults. However, as with all forms of exercise, some care is needed when using them, so please bear in mind the points below and do not use U-Gym if:
·  You have an electronic implant (eg. cardiac pacemaker) or suffer from other heart problem.
·  You are pregnant.
·  You suffer from cancer, epilepsy or are under medical supervision for cognitive dysfunction.
·  You are connected to high-frequency surgical equipment.
·  There are a number of illness not suitable to use U-Gym. Please consult with physician if you are not certain about your condition.
·  Remember to seek professional advice if you feel uncertain in any way after using U-Gym. It's always good to let your doctor know your progress at home.
 
FAQs
 
Q1. Your product is categorized as medical device, so do you have any compliance and qualification?
 
A1. We understand your concern. Basically our product is designed on the basis of a professional electrotherapy device and we will implement all safety measures and protections in case of any mis-operation. In addition, we plan to apply to major countries for FDA compliance and other necessary certifications once we have more prototype on hand. We have consulted with Emergo Group who is specialized in helping companies to get approved. That is why we need to raise a fund on Indiegogo to build more products and cover the expense of multiple applications. 
 
Q2. I’m trying to compare the difference between your U-Gym and other portable TENS or EMS machines. Does the U-Gym stimulate muscle in a way that other similar equipment does not? What is the reason is the price much lower in Taiwan?
 
A2. The most differences between U-GYM and other portable machines are the operating frequency, multiple interferential waveforms and stimulation intensity. Most machines out there still focus on one or two indications but we aim to make U-GYM a multi-purpose device by making it “user programmable”.
People utilize electrotherapy technology for decades, consequently there are many different types of devices on the market. In addition, Taiwan is home of OEM and ODM manufacturers for many name-brand electro-stimulator companies, such as Antelope Suit, Slendertone, OSIM and Omron. For those reasons, the devices are seemly cheaper in Taiwan and China. However, there are not much improvement in design and functionality albeit many years of evolvement, and most portable stimulation devices still look similar and have limited functions. 
U-GYM uses the latest technology and advanced components to make it effective, portable and programmable. We even have to customized and design our own components to match our designs. Thus the cost for producing U-GYM is much higher than we expected. We hope you will enjoy the benefits U-GYM brings you and we look forward to more feedbacks.",23.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1285619/files/20150310233118-Risks___Challenges.jpg?1426055478"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We are fortunate to have spent so much time on product development, supplier relationships, and manufacturing relationships prior to launching our Kickstarter campaign. We can’t mitigate all of the risks, but by waiting until this stage of development, we believe that we have minimized most of them. Of course, with any project like this, there are potential risks in final product development, supply procurement, manufacturing and assembly, and fulfillment.<p></p>
</div><p><b>Final product development:</b> It is possible that there will need to be subtle changes to the hardware or adhesives driven by manufacturing requirements. We will continue to iterate on development and pre-production to minimize the impact of these changes. Of course, we believe that any changes will be in an effort to improve the final product, and we will keep our backers posted about any such changes. Considering the development work that has already been completed, we expect these to be minimal.</p><p><b>Supply procurement:</b> As a small start-up, we recognize that our purchase volumes will be small, especially compared to other companies in other industries. To some extent, we will be operating based on constraints provided by these suppliers. However, we have been developing close relationships with our suppliers, all of whom are excited not just to supply us with parts but to partner with us in the creation of this innovative product. We expect that we will continue to be able to leverage these relationships to prevent any supply constraints from impacting the overall timeline, especially as our volumes increase.</p><p><b>Manufacturing and assembly:</b> As with our suppliers, we have developed strong manufacturing and production relationships. These partners are committed to helping us deliver STEMP™ on time. If demand is greater than expected, this could impact the delivery timeline. We will stay in close communication with our manufacturing partners throughout the campaign to apprise them of updated forecasts, and of course we will communicate frequently with our backers, particularly if delays seem imminent.</p><p><b>Fulfillment:</b> Again, if demand is greater than expected, this could impact the delivery timeline. We will strive to ensure that our fulfillment process and resources (both internal and external) are scaled up appropriately, based on response from the campaign.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1285624/files/20150310233250-STEMP_Social.jpg?1426055570"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Dear Flickr, I’m Sick by <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/calamity_photography/4780572510"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Courtney Carmody</a> is licensed under a <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</i></p><p><i>All other images © STEMP Inc. or their respective logo trademark owners.</i></p><p></p><p></p></div>","STEMP Smart Temperature Patch™ is no longer available via InDemand.

The award-winning STEMP Smart Temperature Patch™ is the thermometer reinvented for the 21st century. The STEMP sensor, medical-grade adhesives, and smartphone apps work together seamlessly to provide immediate, accurate, continuous body temperature measurement. Think of it as the thermometer meets the band-aid. If you have kids, if you have parents, if you have ever been sick, or if you want to manage your health better, this product is for you.Using STEMP™ is as easy as 1-2-3:
➊ Insert the rechargable STEMP™ temperature sensor into a disposable STEMP™ adhesive patch. If you’ve ever inserted tab A into slot B before, you will have no problem!
➋ Apply STEMP™ to your body — or to your child or loved one. Everyone knows how an adhesive bandage works!
➌ Get immediate temperature data on your iPhone. STEMP™ monitors body temperature continuously and wirelessly, for as long as you need it.






We’ve designed STEMP™ to solve the problems we as parents see with thermometers currently on the market:


Reliable temperature measurement: Provides accurate readings the first time and every time, so users never need to worry or re-measure

Continuous monitoring: Collect data, see trends, and make smarter decisions, over hours, days, or even weeks (one charge lasts up to 30 days)

“Wear it and forget it”: Never again must one get up in the middle of the night to wake up a child or loved one to take their temperature

Intelligent mobile app: Features smart alerts, data tracking and analysis, battery status, and an elegant, customizable interface (available now for iOS and Android, including Apple Watch and Android smartwatches)

Convenient form factor: Small size and comfortable, medical-grade adhesives make it easy to wear (including in the shower)

Affordable price: Cutting-edge home healthcare shouldn’t be expensive; STEMP is a high-value product competitive with everything on the market

 STEMP™ is designed for everyone in your family. And everyone in your life! STEMP can be used to monitor body temperature for a variety of applications:


The STEMP Smart Temperature Patch™ is the result of proprietary patent-pending technology. Our design conforms to FCC and CE regulations, among others. We have begun the FDA approval process, which will be concluded following completion of the hardware and software. STEMP™ is based on cutting-edge but proven technologies, integrated to create a seamless, easy-to-use experience for everyone:

We scoured the planet to find the most accurate and efficient temperature sensor available at this size, to make sure that each and every measurement is consistent. The STEMP™ temperature sensor is accurate to ±0.2°C and is factory-calibrated for years of continuous temperature readings.

BLE (sometimes called Bluetooth Smart) technology connects quickly and easily to a smartphone, managing wireless transmission throughout a typical home with little drain on the STEMP™ or phone battery.

The small STEMP™ temperature sensor is housed in a custom-designed, ultrasonically-welded plastic case (33mm long x 20mm wide x 6mm thick) that is safe for children and sized for their smaller bodies.


An integrated lithium polymer (LiPo) battery can be charged quickly (in 30 minutes) with the included USB dock, providing up to 30 days of usage on a single charge.





The STEMP™ sensor is factory-sealed to provide a waterproof unit that is safe for the shower.

We use medical-grade adhesive similar to that found in high-quality bandages — safe for children and sensitive skin, even when worn for hours or days (5–7 days is recommended).Additional adhesives will be available via getstemp.com and eventually via online and brick-and-mortar retail.
The STEMP™ app (available as a free download from the App Store) is designed to provide a simple, intuitive interface to the STEMP™ sensor. Our goal was to make the software as easy to use as a traditional thermometer, but with many additional benefits:The app connects to the STEMP™ sensor quickly and easily, providing immediate and continuous temperature data, without having to remember to take additional readings.

Interactive graphs make it easy to see trends and make smarter decisions. Temperature trends can be used to understand when one is getting sick, to manage health conditions, and to track ovulation cycles for women trying to conceive. The possibilities are endless!
Smart alerts can notify one or more phones if a temperature hits a certain threshold (high or low). Parents need never again wake up in the middle of the night to wake up their children just to take their temperatures. Instead, they can catch up on their rest, confident that their phone will alert them of any important changes.
STEMP™ works with iCloud to share temperature data among multiple iOS devices. That allows a parent, sibling, or caregiver to monitor temperature across town or around the world. Data can be exported to share with a healthcare professional or record in a spreadsheet.
One app can manage multiple STEMP™ sensors and multiple users, storing weeks or months of user data. One family can share a single sensor, “linking” it to a person as needed. Or that same family can have three or four sensors, each of them “assigned” to an individual for easy monitoring.


The STEMP™ app is available now for both iOS and Android, with Apple Watch and Android smartwatch connectivity. STEMP™ is already a showcase for newer iOS features, including Health, Today/Notification Center, and Suggested Apps.














STEMP™ is the product of three parents blessed with six children among us, as well as three loving wives who support our entrepreneurial dreams. We came together in 2013 to create a new kind of thermometer:

A father of three, Barnabas Gero has 15 years of experience in corporate finance, including equity fundraising, M&A, and project finance, including stints at Citibank and Deloitte. He has also been active in developing start-up businesses and film projects between his native Hungary and California. Barnabas received an MPhil Management from Columbia University; he also holds an MA Sociology from New School for Social Research and an MA Political Science from Central European University. Barnabas resides in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and three children.
David J. Whelan is a Los Angeles- and New York-based entrepreneur with 20+ years of experience developing and building companies as a strategy consultant, executive recruiter, and marketing and operations executive. He helped launch one of the first consumer-oriented wearables back in 2005, and he has been operating at the intersection of technology, health, and wellness ever since. Dave holds an MBA from UCLA Anderson School and a BS Symbolic Systems from Stanford University. He also attended Carnegie Mellon University and London Business School. He and his wife have a four-year-old son (“four-and-a-half,” as he would say), a nine-month-old daughter, and a crazy puggle, two of whom are featured in the crowdfunding video.
Each of us believes in leveraging simple technology to make our lives easier, and STEMP™ is the product of those efforts. We are well on the way to launching the STEMP Smart Temperature Patch™. Development of the initial hardware and software began in late 2013 and has gone through multiple rounds of testing, improvements, and retesting. Each iteration has reduced the size and complexity of the hardware, while improving its performance. We have been able to identify and integrate cutting-edge technology to create a product that does not compromise on quality, performance, or price.
We are fortunate to have spent so much time on product development, supplier relationships, and manufacturing relationships prior to launching our Kickstarter campaign. We can’t mitigate all of the risks, but by waiting until this stage of development, we believe that we have minimized most of them. Of course, with any project like this, there are potential risks in final product development, supply procurement, manufacturing and assembly, and fulfillment.
Final product development: It is possible that there will need to be subtle changes to the hardware or adhesives driven by manufacturing requirements. We will continue to iterate on development and pre-production to minimize the impact of these changes. Of course, we believe that any changes will be in an effort to improve the final product, and we will keep our backers posted about any such changes. Considering the development work that has already been completed, we expect these to be minimal.Supply procurement: As a small start-up, we recognize that our purchase volumes will be small, especially compared to other companies in other industries. To some extent, we will be operating based on constraints provided by these suppliers. However, we have been developing close relationships with our suppliers, all of whom are excited not just to supply us with parts but to partner with us in the creation of this innovative product. We expect that we will continue to be able to leverage these relationships to prevent any supply constraints from impacting the overall timeline, especially as our volumes increase.Manufacturing and assembly: As with our suppliers, we have developed strong manufacturing and production relationships. These partners are committed to helping us deliver STEMP™ on time. If demand is greater than expected, this could impact the delivery timeline. We will stay in close communication with our manufacturing partners throughout the campaign to apprise them of updated forecasts, and of course we will communicate frequently with our backers, particularly if delays seem imminent.Fulfillment: Again, if demand is greater than expected, this could impact the delivery timeline. We will strive to ensure that our fulfillment process and resources (both internal and external) are scaled up appropriately, based on response from the campaign.Dear Flickr, I’m Sick by Courtney Carmody is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.All other images © STEMP Inc. or their respective logo trademark owners.",49.0,0,"1 Campaign

community.</p>

<p>Our vision is to grow into the Harmony Yoga and Wellness Center.

We want to be able to offer reduced cost or free services to those in need. We want t<span>o partner with more community organizations to provide services and a healing space to support their clients. </span>And we want to overcome isolation by offering a supportive, healing space where people can gather and connect to improve individual and community health.</p><br/><h3>Why We Need to Grow</h3>
<p>We currently rent a second-floor location with stair access, and limited opening hours, space and facilities. At HYC, we know this has been a great barrier to accessing yoga and wellness services for many people dealing with physical, mental and financial challenges. We need to be as accessible as possible to our community! After searching for the prime location, we've found it - alongside the vibrant Cowichan Green Community and Cycle Therapy Bikes. Our new location will open many doors, with its level-entry access and a greater class capacity that allows us to grow our community and reduce our prices.</p>
<p>At HYC, we aspire to help raise each other up, and work towards a future where members of our community are empowered to care for themselves and each other. Together we can create a strong community that works toward common goals. When individuals reach their full potential, and discover their true nature of contentment and happiness, they can share that strength with other members of the community. Our present location is a barrier to that future. Together, we can make our vision a reality.</p>

We currently rent a second-floor location with stair access, and limited opening hours, space and facilities. At HYC, we know this has been a great barrier to accessing yoga and wellness services for many people dealing with physical, mental and financial challenges. We need to be as accessible as possible to our community! After searching for the prime location, we've found it - alongside the vibrant Cowichan Green Community and Cycle Therapy Bikes. Our new location will open many doors, with its level-entry access and a greater class capacity that allows us to grow our community and reduce our prices.
At HYC, we aspire to help raise each other up, and work towards a future where members of our community are empowered to care for themselves and each other. Together we can create a strong community that works toward common goals. When individuals reach their full potential, and discover their true nature of contentment and happiness, they can share that strength with other members of the community. Our present location is a barrier to that future. Together, we can make our vision a reality.
What We Need & What You Get
With your support, we will be able to pay for the extensive renovations required to transform our new location into a modern yoga studio. We will be able to extend our reception hours to ensure we reach more people in the community. We'll have a studio with more floor space, a second break-out studio, change rooms with cubicles, a shower and bathroom stalls, and 5 professional offices to
accommodate our dedicated holistic practitioners and counsellors. We will be
able to offer more community programs including yoga, meditation, wellness,
counselling, nutrition and more.

Generous contributions will enable us to support people who face financial and other barriers to accessing wellness services, and make it possible for us better serve and grow our community.
We have many perks that we hope will excite and motivate you on your healing journey, or help someone in our community to start theirs! Our perks include yoga passes, private yoga classes, HYC clothing, beautiful silk scarves and embroidered bags made in India, and more! You can use claim them for yourself, give them to someone special (we'll provide a gift certificate), or donate them to a community member in need.
Risks & Challenges
The challenges we face are the normal ups and downs of a small business. Expanding a small business means incurring considerable debt. Outgrowing our current space motivated us to find and commit to a new studio space that will suit our needs now and in the future. This expansion means a significant personal financial commitment for our founder, Deborah, and her partner.
With your generous contribution, we can offset part of the overall cost of expansion, allowing us to focus on delivering high-quality yoga and wellness programs to our community in the Cowichan Valley.

Tushi Pal is the only fitness tracker to combine dedicated and intricate designs with innovative and potentially life-saving technology. Tushi Pal is the only wearable in the world to give you this level of technology, innovation and uniqueness in one.    With Tushi Pal, you can turn intentions into actions.Like any good fitness tracker, Tushi Pal has the ability to expertly track your movements throughout the day. From leisurely walking to hardcore workouts, Tushi Pal has your back with accurate data available at your fingertips.                                                       Tushi Pal APP Compatible with When you set Tushi Pal to the Heart Rate Mode and do any type of activity, like, walking, running, workouts, weight lifting, trekking etc… It will let you know in what stage you are in like, warming up, fat burning, doing aerobic, anaerobic and strenuous exercise by activating the “Breathing Light” in different colors, as seen above. When it comes to your heart health, you don’t want to leave anything up to chance. It doesn’t matter if you’re a marathon runner, a mom on the go or have a serious health condition- it is always important to keep track of your heart rate throughout the day to help prevent potentially serious or life-threatening conditions.Tushi Pal checks in on your heart rate automatically every 15 to 60 minutes using Tushi Pal’s 24-hour, real-time heart rate monitor.When you're working out, the heart rate “sweet spot” is known as the ""target zone”, which is about 60 to 80 percent of your maximum heart rate. With Tushi Pal, you can easily get the details of your heart without sacrificing your work by long-pressing the touch button.Every Tushi Pal comes with a one-of-a-kind woven case that is handcrafted by skilled Mayan artisans. Taller Maya works in collaboration with the World Fair Trade Organization to hire these skilled individuals. Each case will be labeled with the artisans signature, which will make them unique. By purchasing a Tushi Pal, not only are you getting a high-quality, accurate tracker, but you’re helping provide jobs to those in need.To learn more about this organization and how they are helping indigenous communities, please take a look at the bottom of our campaign page.The handmade cases come in three different techniques: Jipi Japa, Sisal back strap loom or waist loom and Sisal Corchado. Your tracker’s strap will come with a dedicated, intricate design that will make you stand out in the crowd. To start, Tushi Pal will come in a beautifully designed blue, each with their own traditional designs. We want to introduce more colors as stretch goals so keep an eye out for when we hit various milestones!In today’s day and age, we are always connected to our phones. Whether we need to be alerted on the score of a football game or are waiting for an important call, Tushi Pal has your back.

 
                                               Tushi Pal APP Compatible with  Learn more about our adventures in helping indigenous communities find jobs. Upon a visit to Merida Yucatan, Mexico, Tushi Pal founders and brothers, Arturo and Jorge Arvizu, spent time with Taller Maya. Taller Maya is the commercial branch of Fundación Haciendas del Mundo Maya, a foundation that represents more than 20 traditional Mayan workshops. Since then, the five partners have developed Tushi Pal, a next-generation tracker that incorporates state-of-the-art technology and distinctive, traditional work.

 
Fundación Haciendas del Mundo Maya is a nonprofit organization that works with Mayan communities in the Yucatán Peninsula. Through our Integral Community Development Program we implement projects for economic and social growth. It promotes the diffusion and conservation of Mayan natural and cultural heritage by establishing the basis to create micro-regional development poles and promoting strategies to strengthen the skills and capacities of the communities’ residents.The Fundación’s vision, which leads with the phrase “know and understand in order to transform” is to serve as a link between the present and the past of the Mayan world by generating new opportunities for individual and social development and help find a balance between the cultural wealth and the possibilities of sustainable economic development. Its mission is to generate actions that promote local identity, recognition and recovery of the Mayan cultural expressions, overcoming poverty by furthering education health and sustainable development opportunities while involving the local population as promoters of their own social development. Fundación Haciendas del Mundo Maya is proud to lead with four main values, respect, transparency, responsibility and solidarity.Taller Maya is a project developed by Fundación Haciendas del Mundo Maya, A.C as part of the Social Enterprises component in which they work with community groups to support their initiatives regarding local income generation –promote the creation of social enterprises and integrate them into the formal production sector.Taller Maya was born when groups of rural Mayan artisans came together to preserve traditional techniques and materials, and working alongside designers created high-quality contemporary design products. The artisans enjoy support that builds and strengthens their co-ops and provides follow-up with regard to production and administration processes while quality and design standards are established and assured.Its philosophy is based on promoting commercial equity; the foundation has supported and trained more than 500 woman artisans and currently works with 200 women in 16 communities; they constitute the co-ops that create the products Taller Maya sells. Now even woman artisans that are not part of the project have the tools and skills they need to work independently.Taller Maya has recovered different handicraft techniques from the Yucatán Peninsula: Jipi Japa sisal (treadle loom), corchado (spinning sisal manually on one leg) and back strap loom.  Sisal CosturadoJipi JapaSisal Backstrap LoomBehind the Scenes

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Marie.  Most inconviences are met with a compromise.  Well, as I was graduating from college, there were times that I wanted to use my Iphone to watch a video, make a call using facetime or something as simple as reading a ebook on my phone.  So typically, I would hold a my phone, or lay it flat, either way, I usually became uncomfortable after a short period of time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was a compromise that was due for an upgrade.  So I came up with a design for a portable mobile device stand that can be used with any phone.  I got someone to build a prototype, and presto, I was watching videos, playing games, making calls, everthing without out having to hold the phone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As time has passed, many of my friends (and even strangers) have asked where did I get it and I'd have to tell them that I had it made.  Thier response is always, ""Can you have one made for me too?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At that time, it was obvious that there was a need for my invention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My fellow indiego'ers, please help me reach my funding goals so everyone can enjoy ""The Chip.""  I named it that because someone tried to ask me where I got it but couldn't find the words to say what she wanted, ""Hey where did you get that, uh... uh... chip, thing.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I am asking you help me help you and others enjoy the benefits of having ""The Chip.""</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know how it feels to be wanting to watch a movie, read a magazine, play a game, or talk on the phone, while at the diner or even at work.  It can be inconvienient.  How about your wrist, do they hurt after playing Farmville for a while?  We are hoping to make mobile devices your mobile desktop when combined with ""The Chip.""  Allow you the freedom of using your mobile device without holding it with your hands.  And the best part about it is that it universally fits on almost any phone and fits into a watch pocket or small purse.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 for the completion of the patent, production, and marketing.  If we do not reach our goal, we will take the money recieved and through our own income, chip in as much as we can so that we can complete the patenting process. </p>

<p>I have been on Disability since 2001, due to several medical issues and bring in less than $800/mo. My husband works full time and goes to college. We are barely getting by as it is, never have enough money to save up for emergencies like this, or the car breaking down, etc. Our landlord has been so patient, as we have fallen behind there as well, due to the downed economy issues. This is so hard for me, as I have never been one to beg, but we really can't afford this trip, and I'm sure I will probably have to go back again, maybe several times. </p>
<p>My stomach issues began when I was just 3 mo. old with <strong>Intussusception of the intestines</strong> (<a href=""http://children.webmd.com/tc/intussusception-topic-overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://children.webmd.com/tc/intussusception-topic-overview</a>). Hospitalized for that 3 times, 3 mo. old, 8 yrs. old and 12 yrs. old and had to have two transfusions pre 1981, when <em><strong>they didn’t check for things like Hep-C yet</strong></em>. My Father always tells me ""the Lord won't give me more than I can handle"" but I feel I am at my wits end already, then I am diagnosed with<strong> Gastro paresis</strong> (<a href=""http://diabetes.webmd.com/tc/gastroparesis-topic-overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://diabetes.webmd.com/tc/gastroparesis-topic-overview</a>). I was referred to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fl. And I hear they are the best at figuring these things out but this trip is going to be hard on us financially, esp. since my husband has to take off work to take me because I can't drive anymore. On top of all that, I have only <strong>one tooth</strong> left in my mouth and<strong> no dentures </strong>because we just can’t afford them. This is why getting to this appt. and being able to afford whatever it is they want to do is so important to me. I don't want to be this sick for the rest of my life knowing it’s only going to get worse medically. The Dr.'s can’t cure any of these illnesses, but there is a good chance that Mayo can increase my<strong> quality of life</strong> so I might be able to go back to having a life.

<p> </p></div>","My name is Carolyn; I am 44 yrs. YOUNG !!
I have been on Disability since 2001, due to several medical issues and bring in less than $800/mo. My husband works full time and goes to college. We are barely getting by as it is, never have enough money to save up for emergencies like this, or the car breaking down, etc. Our landlord has been so patient, as we have fallen behind there as well, due to the downed economy issues. This is so hard for me, as I have never been one to beg, but we really can't afford this trip, and I'm sure I will probably have to go back again, maybe several times. 
My stomach issues began when I was just 3 mo. old with Intussusception of the intestines (http://children.webmd.com/tc/intussusception-topic-overview). Hospitalized for that 3 times, 3 mo. old, 8 yrs. old and 12 yrs. old and had to have two transfusions pre 1981, when they didn’t check for things like Hep-C yet. My Father always tells me ""the Lord won't give me more than I can handle"" but I feel I am at my wits end already, then I am diagnosed with Gastro paresis (http://diabetes.webmd.com/tc/gastroparesis-topic-overview). I was referred to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fl. And I hear they are the best at figuring these things out but this trip is going to be hard on us financially, esp. since my husband has to take off work to take me because I can't drive anymore. On top of all that, I have only one tooth left in my mouth and no dentures because we just can’t afford them. This is why getting to this appt. and being able to afford whatever it is they want to do is so important to me. I don't want to be this sick for the rest of my life knowing it’s only going to get worse medically. The Dr.'s can’t cure any of these illnesses, but there is a good chance that Mayo can increase my quality of life so I might be able to go back to having a life. Due to all these medical issues, I rarely leave the house, except for dr.'s appts. I have lost most of my friends due to the fact I cant go out and socialize like I used to. I'm always worried when my bladder or bowels will decide to let go before I can get to the bathroom.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is John Michael and I regularly compete in extreme obstacles courses throughout the year. This year I competed in a Tough Mudder event and I completed the full course. The video link shows what kind of event that I will be running in this year if my fundraising goal is met.</p>
This race will help support the Wounded Warrior Project which provides assistance to injured veterans coming home from war. The fundraising money will help me pay for the race as well as race related expenses.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I need the money to pay for the race fee which is $450 dollars plus a $45 insurance fee. The remainder of the fundraising money will go towards equipment I need to run the race. I need to purchase a tent for the overnight stay as well as new running gear due to the harsh conditions that I will be running through. Any amount helps and is greatly appreciated. <br/><p>For your donations I will provide race photos of myself before, during and after the race concludes.</p>
<p>Even if I don't reach the entire fundraising goal I can still use what funds were raised to go towards the event.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will help support the injured veterans returning home from overseas and support an excellent cause. To date the Tough Mudder company (for which this event is being run) has donated over 3 million dollars to the Wounded Warrior Project.</p>
This race means a lot to me because I never thought I would be capable of running an event like this. I was never that strong mentally or physically and the event that I ran prior in the year helped me gain confidence. This is more than just a race to me. This event shows that anyone can be capable of great things.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Hey! If you can't donate, do not worry. Any help is appreciated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please share the link for the donation on your facebook and with your friends and family. Help me raise the money so I can compete and support the Wounded Warrior Project.</div>

They embraced me like I was their own family. </p>
<p>Recently, Kenner Jackson, his wife, and 23 month old child were riding on a motorcycle and were struck by a drunk driver. Unfortunatly, Kenner did not make it. His wife made it out with a few injuries. The child, Rachel Jackson, is currently in a hospital in Tegucigalpa with 4 fractures in her skull, brain swelling, and has difficulty moving the right side of her body. </p>
<p>Rachel is currently at the Public Hospital, and is not able to recieve the best medical attention that she needs. In Honduras, there is no health insurance or any kind of insurance available to the family. They needs the funds available at hand for any doctors to perform any kind of test or medical procedure before they can proceed with it. </p>
<p>She needs our help.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly what the cost is going to be, but it will be at a minimum of $10 000. All the money donated here will be going towards her medical bills, whether we make more or less than our goal. (The currency is in Canadian Dollars. approx. 1 CAD= .97 USD)</p>

I have also had the opportunity to live in Honduras for 4 months last year volunteering as a teacher in the school. Throughout these years, I was so blessed to meet a wonderful family- The Jacksons. They embraced me like I was their own family. 
Recently, Kenner Jackson, his wife, and 23 month old child were riding on a motorcycle and were struck by a drunk driver. Unfortunatly, Kenner did not make it. His wife made it out with a few injuries. The child, Rachel Jackson, is currently in a hospital in Tegucigalpa with 4 fractures in her skull, brain swelling, and has difficulty moving the right side of her body. 
Rachel is currently at the Public Hospital, and is not able to recieve the best medical attention that she needs. In Honduras, there is no health insurance or any kind of insurance available to the family. They needs the funds available at hand for any doctors to perform any kind of test or medical procedure before they can proceed with it. 
She needs our help.
I do not know exactly what the cost is going to be, but it will be at a minimum of $10 000. All the money donated here will be going towards her medical bills, whether we make more or less than our goal. (The currency is in Canadian Dollars. approx. 1 CAD= .97 USD)
You can be a part of changing a life. 
Think about how much you can give. Are you willing to sacrifice something to make a big difference in someone's world? 
If you aren't in a place where you can contribute financially, please get the word out about this campaign. We need everyone to see this. We need everyone on board to help Rachel.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Meet Molly Gibbons. Please help make her smile.</h3>
<p>Molly is a an eleven-year-old middle school student in Jamesville, NY, who suffers from Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). EB is a rare and devastating genetic skin disease (affecting only 1 out of 50,000 births) for which there is currently no cure. In this condition, there is a defect in the connective tissue of the skin and mucous membranes that causes the skin to be so fragile that the slightest friction, minor injury, heat, rubbing, or scratching causes severe blistering inside (such as the mouth, stomach, esophagus) and outside of the body. These blisters can cause serious and sometimes fatal problems when they become infected. Those with EB live in unthinkable pain. Young EB patients are often called “butterfly children,"" because their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. </p>
<p>When Molly was born and her diagnosis made, her parents were told that she, like countless other EB babies, would likely not live more than 12 months. Eleven years later, she is a beautiful, caring girl known for her smile, positive attitude and desire to help others.</p>
<p>Molly and her family have privately battled her disease without asking for any financial assistance. They only recently agreed to bring attention to Molly's condition by allowing her to participate in media interviews specifically to generate awareness of EB and for baby Easton Friedel who was born in August 2012 in a community close to Molly's home (see link to media coverage). However, Molly's family's situation has changed and she now needs our help. </p>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">Due to a change in her family's health insurance, none of Molly's bandage costs are covered any longer. Previously, 90% of the approximate $4,000 monthly bandage supply cost was covered by insurance. You can imagine how that change has impacted her family.  <br/><br/>Like most all EB children, Molly's bandages need to be changed about every three days. It takes 3 to 4 hours and the process is so painful that Molly dreads having it done. But she knows her bandage changes are critical to prevent infection and to help keep her wounds from bleeding and blisters from oozing. She is much more comfortable with the bandages on, and as her supply runs low, she worries about the smell and discomfort it will mean if she has to go longer between changes. Not having enough bandages is the last thing this kind and loving little middle school student should have to worry about. <br/><br/>An area pharmacy has generously agreed to sell Molly's bandages at cost and has set up an account for her. Every penny received through this donation campaign will be deposited in Molly's pharmacy account and will be spent on bandages and changing supplies. Though the goal is $1,000, we would love to far exceed that amount and raise enough to cover the approximate $4,000 it will cost to supply Molly's bandages for just one month. It would be such a gift to take away Molly's worry--even if just for a while--about having enough bandages so that she can focus on things other eleven-year-old girls do.<br/><br/>A dollar or two or whatever you can spare will be greatly appreciated by this special little girl and her family. Together, we can make Molly smile!<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/central_new_york_community_com.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/central_new_york_community_com.html</a>

""I know I'm full without that awful 'I ate too much' feeling. I also had tons of energy without the [caffeine]shakes and didn't need coffee. I was super focused, got tons accomplished, and didn't get hungry for hours."" -Blair L.""Ya'll killed it! It's all on point. I'm thinking more clearly because my brain has energy!"" -Martin M.""I am not a breakfast person so I have tried many shakes and supplements. This is the first one that tastes like real food!! and it isn't TOO sweet!"" -Amy E.""Enjoyed that it doesn't have a strong protein after taste"" -Lora D.""I enjoyed the flavor and it stayed mixed with the water very well. The “right-size” blender bottle is also pretty neat. I am feeling more alert, focused, and calm than I usually do in the morning. Typically I consume three cups of coffee each morning and get hungry from missing breakfast. Imagine Tweek from South Park. I look forward to making this a part of my morning!"" -Caleb L.Mobius Breakfast was rated 8.5/10 for both flavor and texture.








Ingredients:
We've worked to handpick the best, all-natural ingredients for this product:


Coconut Milk, not maltodextrin, is the central ingredient. These healthy saturated coconut fats give you consistent energy, not an insulin spike.
A specially engineered dual-blend of protein derived from grass-fed cows and eggs supports muscle and joint health and keeps your mind sharp.

Caffeine derived from 100% Arabica Coffee Beans, for the kick you need to start your day.

Electrolytes keep you hydrated.
A full multivitamin means that you don't have to rely on a handful of different vitamins to give you the nutrients you need - including B Vitamins, which support neural and metabolic health.

Nootropics, made of herbs and amino acids, give your mind energy, increasing focus and decreasing stress.
Three MCTs (Medium Chain Triglycerides) give you energy quickly and consistently.

Mobius Breakfast is entirely gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, and natural, without GMOs.  It's also deliciously dark-chocolate flavored.
Packaged in single-serving packets, Mobius goes wherever you need to be, and ensures you always have the right amount for your drink.

What are Nootropics?Nootropics (/noʊ.əˈtrɒpɨks/ noh-ə-TROP-iks)—also called smart drugs, memory enhancers, neuro enhancers, cognitive enhancers, and intelligence enhancers—are drugs, supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional foods that improve one or more aspects of mental function.   -GoogleL-Carnitine - 1,000mgAccording to the National Institutes of Health, L-Carnitine is an amino acid that transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria of the body’s cells. The cells then burn this fat to produce energy. This is extremely useful as the majority of calories in Mobius Breakfast come from coconut fat. All of this will keep your brain energized throughout your morning.Gotu kola - 500mgComes from the Eastern medicine family, and is an herbal stress reliever. Studies published in the Nepal Medical College Journal and the Journal of Ethnopharmacology found that participants who took gotu kola had reduced stress and increased cognition.  Ashwagandha - 200mgAshwaganha is found in India and is an herb used in Ayurvedic Medicine. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies published in the Indian Journal of Phsychiatry(2), Ashwagandha was shown to decrease anxiety.Rhodiola rosea - 300mgAn herb that helps reduce mental fatigue.  Studies were done with students and with physicians and showed that Rhodiola reduces the mental fatigue that the subjects experienced in stressful environments. The studies were both published in Phytomedicine: International Journal of Phytotherapy and Phytopharmacology.

<p> <i>Yogaboots</i> is entering the final steps before we can produce our long awaited home fitness program.  We just need a little help.</p>
<p><i>Yogaboots</i>
 is a customizable fitness DVD/Blu-Ray that takes into consideration 
your current mood and how much free time you have at any given time!  
Too often, quality products never reach the public due to ""red-tape"" 
and/or public funding hurdles. We created <i>Yogaboots</i> for the people; and, it is the people that will bring <i>Yogaboots</i> to life!</p>
<p>The <i>Yogaboots</i>
 ﬁtness DVD will have the unique feature of allowing the user to select 
how they are feeling and the amount of time they have to exercise in the
 DVD menu (5-60min intervals).  The DVD will then automatically select 
and combine each component of the workout based on these factors.  <i>  Yogaboots</i> ﬁtness DVD’s will revolutionize the home ﬁtness world by providing a customized work out every time.</p>
<p>It
 has been a dream to offer the same quality of workout responsible for

We would love to cross the finish line with you!
 Yogaboots is entering the final steps before we can produce our long awaited home fitness program.  We just need a little help.
Yogaboots
 is a customizable fitness DVD/Blu-Ray that takes into consideration 
your current mood and how much free time you have at any given time!  
Too often, quality products never reach the public due to ""red-tape"" 
and/or public funding hurdles. We created Yogaboots for the people; and, it is the people that will bring Yogaboots to life!
The Yogaboots
 ﬁtness DVD will have the unique feature of allowing the user to select 
how they are feeling and the amount of time they have to exercise in the
 DVD menu (5-60min intervals).  The DVD will then automatically select 
and combine each component of the workout based on these factors.    Yogaboots ﬁtness DVD’s will revolutionize the home ﬁtness world by providing a customized work out every time.
It
 has been a dream to offer the same quality of workout responsible for 
creating Olympic level athletes to the general public. The secret was to
 create a workout that was equally challenging as it was inviting.  The 
beauty and love that this program was created with; in conjunction, with
 the science to back it up (under the watchful eye of Dr. Linda Blade,

have a Master of Acupuncture Degree from the Academy for Five Element
Acupuncture in Gainesville, Florida. 
This is a 36-month program based in the ancient energies of the Five
Elements. Which are rooted in traditional Taoist philosophy of the cycles of
nature.  The tradition of Five Element
Acupuncture is based on the understanding of the cyclical flow of vital
energy-also known as Qi.  Each of the
Five Elements – Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water – represents a distinct
quality of the Qi energy that is vital to the continued health and flow of
nature.  In this program I was taught the
skills of traditional diagnosis and treatment planning as well as understanding
the influences lifestyle has on the whole of a person’s health and well being
and how the constitutional factor plays a big role in the health and balance of
a person’s body, mind and spirit. While I was in the Acupuncture program I also
took the Chinese Herbal Studies Certificate course, this is a 27-mounth course
in the use of Chinese Herbs. We learned the Eight Principle/Zang Fu diagnosis
and treatment models that are the foundation of Chinese herbal studies. For
both of these programs there was class work and clinical internships to apply
and understand what was learned in the real world. There were technique courses
on Point Location, Needle Technique, Pulse Diagnosis, and Taking Case Histories
for both Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs. There were also classes in
self-development such as Qigong, Meditation, and developing the sensitivity of

</p><h4>THE PLAN:</h4><p><b>We will install a proprietary electro-purification system in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros to provide clean water for daily use and to help kill water borne-bacteria responsible for the cholera epidemic in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.</b> <b>This is the first of several planned projects throughout the region.</b><br/></p><h4>
<b>THE PROBLEM:</b>
</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has a severe shortage of clean water and is experiencing the largest cholera epidemic in modern times.  It has sickened over 30,000 people
and killed 472 in the Dominican Republic since November 2010. In neighboring Haiti, it has infected more
than 700,000 people and caused 8,721 deaths since October 2010.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1082056/files/20141208175432-168613-MDR49008ea.png?1418090072"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Officials in Haiti and the Dominican Republic are preparing for a long
campaign against cholera, the water-borne disease that has sickened tens of
thousands of people in the two neighboring Caribbean countries.  Acting
together, the two governments are working on a project to wipe out the disease
on Hispaniola by 2022. The plan will include substantial spending on clean
water and sanitation.<b><br/></b><b><br/></b><h4><b>THE SOLUTION AND TECHNOLOGY :</b></h4>To purify water on an urban scale, the Santiago de los Caballeros Water
Project calls for the installation of a Neptune CF Oxygenation System which
will process over 50,000 gallons of water per day. The Neptune CF System will kill all water-borne bacteria, including the
Cholera Bacteria, as well as other water-borne parasites and bacteria.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1083422/files/20141209064303-IG.jpg?1418136183"" src="""" style=""""/><span>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>The Neptune CF is a patent pending technology that uses oxygen ions from generated ozone to
neutralize and remove biological, organic and chemical contaminants. The system can process 50,000 gallons a day of contaminated water.</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>The Neptune CF System requires no consumables or chemicals and has no
moving parts other than the water in treatment.<span> 
</span></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Since it doesn’t require harsh chemicals such as chlorine or chemical
acids, the Neptune CF System will not have a negative impact on the
environment, and will reduce the costs of water treatment.</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>The Neptune CF System requires only 20% of the electrical energy that
the nearest commercially available solution requires per volume of water
treated.</b></p>
</span>The
project will include installation and support for integrating the Neptune CF System
into the metropolitan water system servicing the city and suburbs of Santiago
de los Caballeros, which currently services approximately 60 percent of
households supporting 329,000 inhabitants. The city is currently upgrading its pumping systems and other
infra-structure, so now would be a good time to install a decontamination
system.

<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>In recent
years the continuity of potable water supply services in Santiago has been
affected by strong population growth due to increased immigration from other
areas of the country.</p>
<p>Various
factors affect the water quality in the Dominican Republic, including: poor
condition of purification systems, minimal operational controls, low level of
maintenance of treatment plants, and mostly intermittent systems. <b>38.4% of water systems have no chlorination
system installed.</b> <b>The fact that a
chlorination system exists is not a guarantee that water is actually properly
disinfected, and water contaminated by bacteria is an ongoing problem. </b></p>
<h4>
<b>THE NEED FOR PURE WATER IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</b>
</h4>
<p>Stopping water-borne diseases is one of the most
important global public health issues in the world today. Everyone has the
obligation to do everything possible to provide clean, purified drinking water
to our neighbors in developing countries. Water, sanitation and hygiene are all
intimately connected to the advancement of developing countries.</p>
<p>Diseases related to water include those due to micro-organisms such as
the bacteria which causes cholera. There are also other diseases related to
parasites that have at least part of their life cycle in water. Diseases such
as malaria have water-related vectors. Certain pulmonary diseases are caused by
bacteria in water droplets.</p>

there are 1.6 million diarrheal deaths related to unsafe water, sanitation, and

</div><br/></div>","THE PLAN:We will install a proprietary electro-purification system in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros to provide clean water for daily use and to help kill water borne-bacteria responsible for the cholera epidemic in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. This is the first of several planned projects throughout the region.
THE PROBLEM:
The Dominican Republic has a severe shortage of clean water and is experiencing the largest cholera epidemic in modern times.  It has sickened over 30,000 people
and killed 472 in the Dominican Republic since November 2010. In neighboring Haiti, it has infected more
than 700,000 people and caused 8,721 deaths since October 2010.
Officials in Haiti and the Dominican Republic are preparing for a long
campaign against cholera, the water-borne disease that has sickened tens of
thousands of people in the two neighboring Caribbean countries.  Acting
together, the two governments are working on a project to wipe out the disease
on Hispaniola by 2022. The plan will include substantial spending on clean
water and sanitation.THE SOLUTION AND TECHNOLOGY :To purify water on an urban scale, the Santiago de los Caballeros Water
Project calls for the installation of a Neptune CF Oxygenation System which
will process over 50,000 gallons of water per day. The Neptune CF System will kill all water-borne bacteria, including the
Cholera Bacteria, as well as other water-borne parasites and bacteria.
· 
The Neptune CF is a patent pending technology that uses oxygen ions from generated ozone to
neutralize and remove biological, organic and chemical contaminants. The system can process 50,000 gallons a day of contaminated water.
· 
The Neptune CF System requires no consumables or chemicals and has no
moving parts other than the water in treatment. 

· 
Since it doesn’t require harsh chemicals such as chlorine or chemical
acids, the Neptune CF System will not have a negative impact on the
environment, and will reduce the costs of water treatment.
· 
The Neptune CF System requires only 20% of the electrical energy that
the nearest commercially available solution requires per volume of water
treated.
The
project will include installation and support for integrating the Neptune CF System
into the metropolitan water system servicing the city and suburbs of Santiago
de los Caballeros, which currently services approximately 60 percent of
households supporting 329,000 inhabitants. The city is currently upgrading its pumping systems and other
infra-structure, so now would be a good time to install a decontamination
system.




In recent
years the continuity of potable water supply services in Santiago has been
affected by strong population growth due to increased immigration from other
areas of the country.
Various
factors affect the water quality in the Dominican Republic, including: poor
condition of purification systems, minimal operational controls, low level of
maintenance of treatment plants, and mostly intermittent systems. 38.4% of water systems have no chlorination
system installed. The fact that a
chlorination system exists is not a guarantee that water is actually properly
disinfected, and water contaminated by bacteria is an ongoing problem. 

THE NEED FOR PURE WATER IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Stopping water-borne diseases is one of the most
important global public health issues in the world today. Everyone has the
obligation to do everything possible to provide clean, purified drinking water
to our neighbors in developing countries. Water, sanitation and hygiene are all
intimately connected to the advancement of developing countries.
Diseases related to water include those due to micro-organisms such as
the bacteria which causes cholera. There are also other diseases related to
parasites that have at least part of their life cycle in water. Diseases such
as malaria have water-related vectors. Certain pulmonary diseases are caused by
bacteria in water droplets.


According to the United Nations World Health Organization, every year
there are 1.6 million diarrheal deaths related to unsafe water, sanitation, and
hygiene—the vast majority among children under 5. More than
one billion people lack access to an improved water source.
* 
An estimated 2.4 billion people lack adequate sanitation and 1.1 billion people
are without access to safe water. 
* 
90% of wastewater in developing countries is discharged into rivers and streams
without any treatment. 
* There
are 1.6 million deaths per year attributed to dirty water and poor sanitation. 
* In the
past ten years, diarrhea related to unsanitary water has killed more children
than all the people lost to armed conflict since WWII. 
* At any
one time, it is estimated that half the world's hospital beds are occupied with
patients suffering from water-borne diseases. 
* The
average distance that women in developing countries walk to collect water per
day is four miles and the average weight that women carry on their heads is
approximately 44 pounds.

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) gas forms primarily when carbon fuels
are not burned completely. Mobile sources account for the majority of CO
emissions These sources include both on-road vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks,
motorcycles) and nonroad vehicles and engines (e.g., farm equipment,
construction equipment, aircraft, marine vessels). Consequently, high
concentrations of CO generally occur in areas with heavy traffic congestion. In
cities, as much as 95 percent of all CO emissions may come from automobile
exhaust). Other sources of CO emissions include industrial processes,
non-transportation fuel combustion, and natural sources, such as wildfires.(<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Source : US EPA )</span></p>

</div></div>","Featured On                         ""This week, we came across an Indiegogo project that we wanted to highlight particularly for all Indians, especially those who live in Delhi, which was recently acknowledged as the most polluted city in the world""            ""Using Wepo, you'll be able to regularly see information about air quality, and be more conscious about pollution""            
          ""Wepo is a small, carbon-monoxide-sensing box that’s worn on the belt and notifies users about the quality of the air around them""             
           ""A new device that's good for your health and compatible with your smart watch is in the works, only instead of counting your steps it tells you where to go for cleaner air""                             ""Wepo is meant to be a good companion for your smart watch, to fight air pollution & restore the Right to Air quality in a new way, also for cleaner and greener future""                        ""Wepo is your personal pollution detector""5 decades have gone, we haven't heard the words of Mr. Lyndon B. Johnson, loud and clear. Still we are in a perpetual state of denial on the issues of air pollution. Air pollution is not only an American problem, its a global issue and it is time to move forward and restore Right to Air.






to disrupt how you WATCH air quality
to be a Wearable You'll Actually Wear - Every Day
to empower citizens to know about air quality conveniently on their wrist
to be a good companion for your Smart Watch
to fight Air Pollution & restore the Right to Air quality in a Smart way
for cleaner and greener future 


















Wepo is incorporated with powerful technologies into something very small enough to wear and to create entirely new experience on how we look and feel about at the air quality around us. The first generation of Wepo is packed with Carbon Monoxide sensors. Successive variants of Wepo with Nitrogen Dioxide sensors, Particulate Matter sensors and much more pollutants will be made available soon.
Wepo is packed with one of the most accurate miniature carbon monoxide sensor in such a small footprint .The Electrochemical Carbon Monoxide sensor in Wepo is tested rigorously for its accuracy .





Wepo app is available for iOS, Android ( 4.3 and above ) and Tizen devices (Galaxy Gear S Smartwatch). Android wear smart watch platform is also supported. The mobile app allows you to track air quality, and over time, helps you see trends in the way environment changes, allowing you to make smart decisions.

Get the information on air quality conveniently on your wrist with the help of Wepo





We have been working on Wepo for the past one year and have successfully developed a working prototype and functional app. Wepo has undergone several successful rounds of prototyping, testing and validation. We are now designing and fabricating a larger lot of systems in support of an alpha test program.
We are currently focusing on:


Finalizing engineering design & schematics for production
Fine tuning iOS,Android and Tizen smart watch app to ensure it works flawlessly
Developing sophisticated analytics and data visualization in the app











We are currently on track to deliver Wepo to backers in July 2015, and we're excited to keep all of our backers up to date on progress and developments!

<h2>MAMAKI: WELLNESS IN A CUP</h2>
<p><strong>Mamaki</strong> (<em>Pipturus albidus</em>) is a plant that is indigenous to the Hawaiian Rainforest. It grows no where else in the world. We have been in the tea business since 1995 and have worked with mamaki for 10 years. The way we used to get mamaki was from foragers who would pick it in the wild. The amount we could get was very limited.</p>
<p>Now, this remarkable plant is being grown on a sustainable and pristine farm on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>    My name is Vanessa, and this fundraiser is for my best friend Ariel. Ariel Duell is 22years old, a wife and mother to two amazing children. She was diagnosed with a brain tumor the size of a tennis ball in early June, 2013. The doctors soon discovered that Ariel has had this tumor on her brain since she was born! This tumor had grown so large it was causing extreme pressure on her brain, resulting in seizures. With these seizures the doctors enforced regulations on her life. Ariel is no longer allowed to drive, she must have someone with her at all times, and the worst of all, she was not allowed to hold her children unless seated. Finally, on July 31st, 2013 Ariel underwent brain surgery. The doctors were able to remove a majority of the cancerous tumor; however, Ariel will soon start chemo and radiation to remove the remaining portion. Ariel has been a fighter and this obstacle has shown me even more how strong she truly is!</p>
<p>   This fund is my way of helping Ariel and her family during this stressful time. I am hoping with the support and generosity of others, we can reduce her medical bills and family expenses, allowing her to focus on recovery.</p>
<p></p>

Even if I am unable to reach my goal of $10,000, the donations raised will still be given to Ariel to reduce her bills that are accumulating. </p>
<p>   Ariel has been so strong through this and her family and I want her to be able to concertrate on getting well. Please help Ariel's road to recovery! As my way of beginning to thank you I will be making handmade gifts of thanks.</p>

procedure known as <i>visual inspection with acetic acid</i>.  Using

<strong>To address this serious health problem, CECAP, a cervical cancer

However, Kilombero is a large rural district with few paved roads.

medical services in a distant town. Therefore, CECAP would  like to bring

transportation to and from the screening sites.  The 2013 fundraising
campaign provided funds to screen nearly 300 women over a period of four days!  CECAP was also able to provide the transportation

<p>There are many rural areas that could benefit from these services and any

<br/></span></div></div>","My Inspiration!
I love soccer. But not everyone is able to enjoy this beautiful sport. As a little girl, I was always told that one person can make a huge impact. As a high school student, I wanted to make one of my dreams a reality. So, I founded Gear for Cheer, a movement aimed at spreading the joys of soccer around the globe.



What GFC Needs

With rising shipping costs, it has become increasingly expensive to ship the collected gear around the country to larger organizations. The raised funds will go towards delivering donations. Whatever is not used for shipping will go to Peace Passers, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  100%. 


Your generosity is invaluable. 
I've always had an immense appreciation for various nonprofits who spend their time and energy towards making the world a better place. Now, it's time for me to give back. The feeling of empowerment and excitement when I see people responding to my efforts is indescribable. Whether or not GFC reaches its goal, your contributions are infinitely appreciated.
Cool Perks!A donation of as little as $1 will go a long way in bettering someone else's life. All donors will be featured on Gear for Cheer's ""Cheers"" page for everyone to admire. Donate more, and you can receive shout outs, thank-yous or even a custom T-shirt!

DyAnna Gordon CPM, is a midwife serving families in Southern Utah. She has been dedicated to supporting families in birth for over ten years. When she was 19 she visited Africa for an extended vacation and was shocked at the poverty and illness that she witnesses especially among pregnant women and young children. After completing a Bachelors of Science degree, becoming the mother of four children, and achieving her Certified Professional Midwife credential she is feeling the call to give back and serve in this capacity at MamaBaby Haiti. 
WHAT?
Dy will serve as a midwife for three weeks at MamaBaby Haiti helping to provide prenatal care for up to 600 women every month as well as helping the staff midwives deliver 30-200 births a month.
WHERE?
MamaBaby Haiti is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the health and well being of mothers and babies. Their mission is to lower the maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality rate in Haiti. All services and education are free. They teach mothers and families about prenatal health and nutrition, hygiene, childbirth education, breastfeeding education with the goal of exclusive breastfeeding for a minimum of one year, contraception methods, and sustainable living (including herbal health remedies, gardening and raising chickens).

WHY?

Some shocking statistics about Haiti:
– 74 babies die per 1000 births – the highest in the Western Hemisphere
 
– 12% of all babies die before their 1st birthday 
 
– 1/3 of all children die before their 5th birthday
 
– 1in 71 women will die in pregnancy or childbirth 
 
– 50% population earns less than $60 a year
 
– Less than 45% of the population has clean water 

Education, prenatal, birth and postpartum care by a skilled midwife can make a huge difference in reducing these numbers.

HOW?
Donate, donate,donate! All funds will go directly to cover travel expenses as well as pay for room and board including body guard, chef to insure clean food and water, interpreter, and supplies that will remain in Haiti when Dy returns home.

<p style="""">Richard Boulter is the first born of a family of five from Rockport Massachusetts. His parents are deeply compassionate, community-minded people who constantly think of and help others. Richard, a hard-working landscaper and well-respected business owner for almost 40 years, followed their example, and off-season has mentored people on spiritual quests. He uplifts people towards a significantly more positive life and outlook. He is a giver through and through, like his parents.</p>
<p style="""">Now he needs your help.</p>
<p style="""">A freak swimming accident while on vacation in Nicaragua in 2010 fractured his spine and left him a quadriplegic. All of his personal and business assets were used to pay for his hospitalization there and the Life Flight that brought him back to Massachusetts. His oldest son became his primary caregiver and has coordinated round-the-clock assistance for his father.</p>
<p style="""">The life of a quadriplegic is tenuous. When a patient lies in bed for a prolonged period, normal blood circulation breaks down and bed sores develop. Unfortunately Richard has reached this stage and his bed sores are infected. This has become a systemic condition, meaning his entire blood circulatory system carries an infection. It is severely debilitating.</p>
<p style="""">In order to recover from such a deeply embedded condition, an individual's cells need the proper voltage  to facilitate normal cell repair. Without proper voltage there is no healing.</p>
<p style="""">The intention of this fund raising campaign is to immediately purchase the device which addresses this lowered body voltage specifically. It is the Bio-modulator machine developed by Dr. Jerry Tennant. Dr. Tennant himself contracted meningitis and lost his medical practice. He was unable to receive help from any of his peer physicians. Out of urgent necessity to gain back his life, he researched and uncovered the connection between cell voltage and tissue healing. Now with his health restored, he manufactures a device which introduces voltage into tissues where it is needed. He holds periodic training seminars for health practitioners who will use the Bio-modulator.</p>
<p style="""">This campaign effort will result in the immediate purchase of the Bio-modulator and the personal hands-on training in Texas at Dr. Jerry Tennant's facility.</p>
<p style="""">Richard Boulter very fortunately has had the dogged assistance of a health related therapist local to him ,<a href=""http://massagesanctuary.yolasite.com/our-therapists.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: #1eb9c1; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title=""Julie Amriti Duffy MA LMT""> Julie Amriti Duffy, MA, LMT</a>. This is the individual who will be trained. The integrity, compassion and dedication of this person is on an angelic plane.</p>

</div></div>","Richard Boulter is the first born of a family of five from Rockport Massachusetts. His parents are deeply compassionate, community-minded people who constantly think of and help others. Richard, a hard-working landscaper and well-respected business owner for almost 40 years, followed their example, and off-season has mentored people on spiritual quests. He uplifts people towards a significantly more positive life and outlook. He is a giver through and through, like his parents.
Now he needs your help.
A freak swimming accident while on vacation in Nicaragua in 2010 fractured his spine and left him a quadriplegic. All of his personal and business assets were used to pay for his hospitalization there and the Life Flight that brought him back to Massachusetts. His oldest son became his primary caregiver and has coordinated round-the-clock assistance for his father.
The life of a quadriplegic is tenuous. When a patient lies in bed for a prolonged period, normal blood circulation breaks down and bed sores develop. Unfortunately Richard has reached this stage and his bed sores are infected. This has become a systemic condition, meaning his entire blood circulatory system carries an infection. It is severely debilitating.
In order to recover from such a deeply embedded condition, an individual's cells need the proper voltage  to facilitate normal cell repair. Without proper voltage there is no healing.
The intention of this fund raising campaign is to immediately purchase the device which addresses this lowered body voltage specifically. It is the Bio-modulator machine developed by Dr. Jerry Tennant. Dr. Tennant himself contracted meningitis and lost his medical practice. He was unable to receive help from any of his peer physicians. Out of urgent necessity to gain back his life, he researched and uncovered the connection between cell voltage and tissue healing. Now with his health restored, he manufactures a device which introduces voltage into tissues where it is needed. He holds periodic training seminars for health practitioners who will use the Bio-modulator.
This campaign effort will result in the immediate purchase of the Bio-modulator and the personal hands-on training in Texas at Dr. Jerry Tennant's facility.
Richard Boulter very fortunately has had the dogged assistance of a health related therapist local to him , Julie Amriti Duffy, MA, LMT. This is the individual who will be trained. The integrity, compassion and dedication of this person is on an angelic plane.
In the event that this campaign is successful to a greater degree than the immediate need, a non profit organization will be formed to raise funds for additional health practitioners to be equipped with and trained in the use of the Tennant Bio-modulator.
You can help today. Many persons who are in desperate need do not have access to or knowledge of this revolutionary device. Your contribution will help with an urgent need and could go a long way toward raising awareness and helping many more people.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Cystic Fibrosis Story</h3>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder you're born with, I was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis at 6 months old, but that is hardly the beginning of my journey with CF. When I was 8 years old I was confronted with the decision or whether or not i want to be put on a list for a double lung transplant after spending weeks in and out the hospital. When i was 14 I made the decision that a feeding tube would help me stay healthy and would be a good idea.  These are decisions I made with the help of my parents and my doctors but the ultimate decision was mine. </p>
<p>In my time in and out of the hospital I made friends with other Cystic's but unfortunately due to the nature of our diseae we're not allowed to be within 6 feet of eachother or in the same room without wearing a mask. </p>
<p>In April of 2012 I recieved word that one of my friends with Cystic Fibrosis had become critically ill and a few hours later she was gone. I'd never lost someone like that before, the feeling of hopelessness is overwhelming and crushing.  I began to question what the purpose of everything was, and why I was working so hard in college when life would inevidably end.</p>
<p>In August of 2012 those questions only increased at the loss of a very young friend of mine he was 10 years old. He was one of the best people i knew, he really knew how to live. After he passed away I realized that the only thing I could d for them was to help the rest of the Cystic's out there, and that is what i fully intend to do.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/956934/pictures/full/20130730055244-Tracker_top_view_w_logo.jpg?1375188766"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p></span><p><em>iT</em> is a small – about 25mm across – Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) tracking and motion sensor device. When paired with a free, easy to operate app, called <em>Find</em> <em>iT</em>, you can track and locate any item you want.</p>
<p><em>iT</em> has a range of up to 35m and the app allows you to track up to ten <em>iT</em>s at once, which gives you the power to track and locate multiple items at the same time.</p>
<p>You can use the app to customise every function of <em>iT</em>, such as tethering distance, reporting frequency, motion sensor on/off, name, etc.</p>
<p><em>iT</em> will initially be released for the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5. with a plan to develop support for the new iPad, iPad Mini, new iPod Touch,  Samsung Android 4.0 devices, and Android 4.3 devices in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Find</em> <em>iT</em> app</strong></p>
<p>The app is the driver that allows you to use and customise each and every <em>iT</em>.</p>
<p>The screen on the left is what you will see after pairing a device with the app. You can assign the device a colour and a name, e.g. red - mum's handbag; blue - dad's wallet, You can alter the set up at any time.</p>
<p><img alt=""Find iT"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/956912/pictures/full/20130730063935-7.jpg?1375191577"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The screen on the right allows you to view every <em>iT</em>, an indication of how far away <em>iT</em> is or if the <em>iT</em> is out of range. The various colours on the side allow you to quickly scan the list and select your chosen <em>iT</em>. From this screen you can easily switch the connection on or off.</p>
<p> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Features</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invisible Tether</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine your valued possessions are attached to you with an invisible string (tether). Once you have set the distance of the tether - short, medium or long - the app will notify you if the <em>iT</em> moves outside of the set range. The app will also notify you when it is in range again. For example, while everyone else is fighting for standing room  at the airport carousel you can sit down and wait for notification from <em>Find</em> iT.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion Sensor</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If <em>iT</em> moves you will know about it! <em>iT</em> has a built-in motion sensor so when <em>iT </em>moves you will receive notification. The motion sensor will know if someone opens your locker door, for example, or moves your handbag and will send a notification to your phone.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buzzer/Light</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be how you will find <em>iT</em>. You will be able to activate a buzzer and a light on the <em>iT</em> from the app so you can see/hear where <em>iT</em> is. A video will be uploaded soon showing how this feature works.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distance indicator</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Find iT</em> app lists every <em>iT</em> you have paired with the device and gives an indication of their distance from your current location using a green (short), yellow (intermediate) and red (long) light next to the name. You can switch them on and off as needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Where was <em>iT</em>?</strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/956917/pictures/full/20130730053956-Where_was_iT.png?1375188001"" src="""" style=""width: 378.46px; height: 205px; float: right;""/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you move outside the range of an <em>iT</em> the app will register your location on a map so you know where you were when <em>iT </em>was last in range. You can go back to that location, use the light and buzzer and find your lost item.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Promise</span></strong></p>
<p>We are passionate and committed to the continuing development of the <em>iT </em>line of products. We have engaged an award-winning design house to develop prototypes of <em>iT </em>and our future products....more information coming soon.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Where Are We Now? </strong></span></p>
<p>We currently have a number of working prototypes of the boards so our focus is:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing - trialling and manufacturing a larger batch of pre-production boards to work through any issues that can occur in the early stages of manufacturing</li>
<li>App development - we have a functional app but we have to tweak it to look and work the way we want it to.</li>
<li>Housing -  samples will arrive shortly and we will then start the tooling process to allow us to produce a quality product in volume.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Why We Need YOUR Help</strong></span></p>
<p>We have been in development for eight months and are progressing well but now we need your help to take <em>iT</em> to the next level. Our goal is to raise sufficient funds to bring <em>iT</em> to full production and then take <em>iT</em> to the marketplace.Your support will ensure the success of this exciting project. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Our Next Device</strong> </span></p>
<p>Our next device will allow you to receive notifications for any or all of your <em>iTs</em> without having to be in range. Using a WiFi connection and running off mains power you will have constant access through the app so if any of your <em>iTs</em> move or go out of range you will know. This will allow you to set up a personal net over anything you want.</p>

iT is a small – about 25mm across – Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) tracking and motion sensor device. When paired with a free, easy to operate app, called Find iT, you can track and locate any item you want.
iT has a range of up to 35m and the app allows you to track up to ten iTs at once, which gives you the power to track and locate multiple items at the same time.
You can use the app to customise every function of iT, such as tethering distance, reporting frequency, motion sensor on/off, name, etc.
iT will initially be released for the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5. with a plan to develop support for the new iPad, iPad Mini, new iPod Touch,  Samsung Android 4.0 devices, and Android 4.3 devices in the future.
The Find iT app
The app is the driver that allows you to use and customise each and every iT.
The screen on the left is what you will see after pairing a device with the app. You can assign the device a colour and a name, e.g. red - mum's handbag; blue - dad's wallet, You can alter the set up at any time.

The screen on the right allows you to view every iT, an indication of how far away iT is or if the iT is out of range. The various colours on the side allow you to quickly scan the list and select your chosen iT. From this screen you can easily switch the connection on or off.
 Features

Invisible Tether

Imagine your valued possessions are attached to you with an invisible string (tether). Once you have set the distance of the tether - short, medium or long - the app will notify you if the iT moves outside of the set range. The app will also notify you when it is in range again. For example, while everyone else is fighting for standing room  at the airport carousel you can sit down and wait for notification from Find iT.

Motion Sensor

If iT moves you will know about it! iT has a built-in motion sensor so when iT moves you will receive notification. The motion sensor will know if someone opens your locker door, for example, or moves your handbag and will send a notification to your phone.

Buzzer/Light

This will be how you will find iT. You will be able to activate a buzzer and a light on the iT from the app so you can see/hear where iT is. A video will be uploaded soon showing how this feature works.

Distance indicator

The Find iT app lists every iT you have paired with the device and gives an indication of their distance from your current location using a green (short), yellow (intermediate) and red (long) light next to the name. You can switch them on and off as needed.
 


Where was iT?


If you move outside the range of an iT the app will register your location on a map so you know where you were when iT was last in range. You can go back to that location, use the light and buzzer and find your lost item.
 
Attaching iT

Drop iT

Drop and go! Simply drop iT into your bag, wallet or folder.
  

Stick iT

Use the pre-supplied double sided tape to permanently attach your iT.
 

Key Ring iT

We have designed an easy to operate, robust key ring attachment.
  
 

Hold iT 

The mounting cradle can be attached to anything and everything. The cradle has a simple clip mechanism that allows you to remove and replace iT as required. Choose from  velcro, suction cup or a clip.

 
Device Specs
Diameter: 25mm
Thickness: 4.6mm
Battery Life: Up to 1 year
Battery Type: Coin Cell Battery
Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy)
Device Compatibility: iT will initially be released for the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5. with a plan to develop support for the new iPad, iPad Mini, new iPod Touch,  Samsung Android 4.0 devices, and Android 4.3 devices in the future.
 
Our Promise
We are passionate and committed to the continuing development of the iT line of products. We have engaged an award-winning design house to develop prototypes of iT and our future products....more information coming soon.

Where Are We Now? 
We currently have a number of working prototypes of the boards so our focus is:-

Testing - trialling and manufacturing a larger batch of pre-production boards to work through any issues that can occur in the early stages of manufacturing
App development - we have a functional app but we have to tweak it to look and work the way we want it to.
Housing -  samples will arrive shortly and we will then start the tooling process to allow us to produce a quality product in volume.


Why We Need YOUR Help
We have been in development for eight months and are progressing well but now we need your help to take iT to the next level. Our goal is to raise sufficient funds to bring iT to full production and then take iT to the marketplace.Your support will ensure the success of this exciting project. 

Schedule

September 2013 – Indiegogo campaign launched
October/November 2013 – Alpha testing and Certification
November/December 2013 - Beta testing and first consumer testing
January/February 2014 - Production begins/Shipping to customers to commence
November/December 2013 - The campaign for the next device from the iT Company

Our Next Device 
Our next device will allow you to receive notifications for any or all of your iTs without having to be in range. Using a WiFi connection and running off mains power you will have constant access through the app so if any of your iTs move or go out of range you will know. This will allow you to set up a personal net over anything you want.

The approach is still the same but in a directer smaller scale. Currently</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span>companies rely on generating group awareness through facebook, twitter etc and targeting information to a specific audience.

“word of mouth”

automated web based marketing software
LOOP is a marketing software tool that increases profit and efficiency, with the added benefit of providing detailed information of sales that are a direct cause of its application. The people that have viewed it's potential already find it a product that will change the future of digital marketing. The LOOP technology introduces a completely new approach in marketing.It is currently in the last phase of development and I have programmed it to an almost Alpha state.
 
WHY LOOP WORKS
Let's say you want to sell something new. It could be anything from a car, a laptop or a pair of sunglasses to a certain brand of toothpaste.
Conventional marketing relies on large scale and expensive marketing campaigns to obtain new customers.
Thanks to the internet customers now have access to information about all the products available to them, and these products are talked about on a grand scale, generating a community of trusted “experts” that influence the success of products they talk about online.
Yahoo, Google and Facebook are a good example of platforms abundant with customers that have a question about a certain product and are looking for answers. On the other hand you have another group that in turn supplies them with answers, experts in various areas of expertise and enthusiasts eager to answer all their questions. Now of course web marketing has existed for quite some time, but the way this is done is still with the legacy state of mind. The approach is still the same but in a directer smaller scale. Currently
companies rely on generating group awareness through facebook, twitter etc and targeting information to a specific audience. This is not the true meaning of word of mouth; and only reaches one single person.
This is where LOOP comes in; this software is designed to inventively make use of the “Word of Mouth” principle, connecting Supply and Demand. It searches the internet for questions asked by potential customers and then connects them to satisfied and experienced buyers.
Like most people we are tempted to do some research when planning to purchase a new product we are interested in, and when we do we rely on people that know the product to enthuse us about it - to confirm that the product is actually as good as we hope it will be, rather than relying solely on biased advertising.
As stated before; Google, Yahoo and Facebook already make millions by supplying potential customers with advertising they are possibly interested in, based on their browsing history or the interests of their friends. This amount could be significantly increased using LOOP software.
 
HOW LOOP WORKS
primary functionality:
A Company plans to promote a new product and decides to use LOOP to generate word of mouth marketing.
LOOP searches the web, looking for and recognising positive feedback about the product in question.
This can be feedback a customer has paid for in order to promote it or generate sales, a blog, forums or any other web page it is discussed on. A potential buyer posts a question about the products and LOOP links them to a few adamant supporters of it, improving their idea of the product and thus increasing the chance they will buy it. After the potential buyer has been linked with the supporters, we follow and log the data, which in turn allows us to prove a sale actually taking place. The current methods of gathering information on the effect of marketing and actual sales generated by it are an advertising nightmare. LOOP more accurately reaches customers and will better prove an actual sale. All of this, it can do millions of times per day and only running from 1 server, leaving large potential for our software customers.
 
Secondairy functionality:
Apart from connecting potential buyers with supporters LOOP can also search the internet for any
negative feedback given on a product or company.
LOOP can provide its own feedback with answers designed to debunk any claims that are made. Again
not by spraying propaganda, but with actual opinions generated by real people. By connecting to the
rumour spreaders it tones back public opinion to rational train of thought.
 
How is this then sold as a product?
The inherited functionality of the product will make this an easy sell to both consumers as to marketing companies, LOOP can sell itself by picking a few companies and using it on their products. The results generated can then be presented to the companies themselves or the marketing companies working for them.
We would be able to show them actual results of increased sales. Some research and feel for the market was already done, finding there is a huge potential of marketing companies .
Simply said , right now there is nothing out there remotely resembling the potential of this product. It can do the same as is being done right now, but in its full functionality can do five times more.
Being fully automated, the cost of using its services do not go up for the first 1000 clients other then maintainance.
The claim to fame of a product selling itself becomes an actual reality here!
Return On Investment
You should see a return within one year after completion. Below you can see a short list of current products that are similar but have very limited functionality compared to my product. If we would do a quick calculation you could see that a quick return is very feasable and highly likely.
http://engagor.com/pricing/  
asks 21.000,- annually for creating monthly buzz services.
http://www.buzzcapture.com/brand-monitor/
their services can go up to 20.000,- for a single buzz campaign.
http://www.poolworldwide.com/
Creating buzz with guerilla marketing and viral adds at 5000,- a try, not even including the actual making of such videos.
What does this mean when it comes to possible revenue?
If we keep the above mentioned in mind. This means that for LOOP to return its original funding; it would only need about 2 to 3 annual contracts with a brand they have in their current portfolio.

This in any market is the best selling position to be in. As the costs very marginally go up with the intensity of using our service, LOOP is almost cost neutral from this point.
What is great about LOOP
I am very aware that when it comes to marketing people think about being sold things they don't want; however this software can only sell what other people already love, therefor it puts an end to spamming customers to sell things they do not want, but instead caters to people who in fact are looking for something specific; and assists them!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Amy Hopkins' New Heart Valve</h3>
<p>Amy Hopkins is a remarkable woman whose life is the embodiment of living simply and giving generously. A member of the Musical Instrument Maker's Forum, talented musician, skilled luthier, and accomplished carpenter, she lives an incredibly modest life. Amy cares for her ailing father at his home and lives in a building on the same farm without the modern conveniences many of us take for granted.</p>

<p>When Katrina struck New Orleans Amy not only helped restore numerous instruments that had been damaged, she also made multiple trips to NOLA to help rebuild fellow musician Sunpie and wife's home.</p>

<p>Amy also helped my husband and I rebuild our home after the 2010 Nashville flood. She was the first to arrive and declared a home that had been under 2' of water for over three days, ""not bad. This is nothing. We can save it.""</p>
<p>    <img alt=""My living room during the flood"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1257.photobucket.com/albums/ii511/SpashionistaReport/Amy/SSPX0147.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nashville flood 2010 damage""/>   <img alt=""Clint and Amy put in a floor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1257.photobucket.com/albums/ii511/SpashionistaReport/Amy/amy8.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Amy and Clint Nashville flood 2010""/>    <img alt=""Amy and Dave rebuild the front porch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1257.photobucket.com/albums/ii511/SpashionistaReport/Amy/Amy9.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Amy and Dave Nashville flood 2010""/>  </p>
<p>Now it's up to us to save Amy. Recently, her doctor discovered a congenital defect in her aorta where two of the aortic valvular leaflets had fused during development; a condition called Bicuspid Aortic Valve. People with BAV tire easily and have difficulty maintaining stamina for moderate to intense physical activity. The heart is unduly stressed in order to either pump more blood through a defective valve or attempt to circulate regurgitation blood through a leaking valve. Surgery to replace the defective valve was imperative. Amy's doctor told her without the procedure she would be dead within a year's time.</p>
<p>      <img alt=""Amy post-op"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1257.photobucket.com/albums/ii511/SpashionistaReport/Amy/amy3.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Amy post-op at Johns Hopkins""/>       <img alt=""Amy showing off her scar"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1257.photobucket.com/albums/ii511/SpashionistaReport/Amy/amy1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Amy's impressive scar""/>     </p>
<p>Thankfully Amy had her surgery at Johns Hopkins on June 15th. She did better than expected and is now convalescing at home. With no insurance and barely any posessions Amy has too much to qualify for assistance yet far too little to pay the mounting medical bills herself. Our goal is to raise $35,000 to go in it's entirety (minus indiegogo's fees) towards Amy's surgery and aftercare expenses.</p>
<p> Please help Amy in any way you can. If you can give a few dollars your donation, however small, makes a difference. If you can't give you can spread the word. Share Amy's story by using the sharing tools below or by using good old-fashioned word of mouth. Let's show Amy that a lifetime of caring has earned her a ton of good karma in return!</p>

When Katrina struck New Orleans Amy not only helped restore numerous instruments that had been damaged, she also made multiple trips to NOLA to help rebuild fellow musician Sunpie and wife's home.
            
Amy also helped my husband and I rebuild our home after the 2010 Nashville flood. She was the first to arrive and declared a home that had been under 2' of water for over three days, ""not bad. This is nothing. We can save it.""
             
Now it's up to us to save Amy. Recently, her doctor discovered a congenital defect in her aorta where two of the aortic valvular leaflets had fused during development; a condition called Bicuspid Aortic Valve. People with BAV tire easily and have difficulty maintaining stamina for moderate to intense physical activity. The heart is unduly stressed in order to either pump more blood through a defective valve or attempt to circulate regurgitation blood through a leaking valve. Surgery to replace the defective valve was imperative. Amy's doctor told her without the procedure she would be dead within a year's time.
                  
Thankfully Amy had her surgery at Johns Hopkins on June 15th. She did better than expected and is now convalescing at home. With no insurance and barely any posessions Amy has too much to qualify for assistance yet far too little to pay the mounting medical bills herself. Our goal is to raise $35,000 to go in it's entirety (minus indiegogo's fees) towards Amy's surgery and aftercare expenses.
 Please help Amy in any way you can. If you can give a few dollars your donation, however small, makes a difference. If you can't give you can spread the word. Share Amy's story by using the sharing tools below or by using good old-fashioned word of mouth. Let's show Amy that a lifetime of caring has earned her a ton of good karma in return!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a multidisciplinary group of inventors, software developers, permacultors and other people that wants to start a transition industrial space. <br/></p>
<p>We want to create a space in which to live and work, with space for environment friendly industries (recycling, used-oil transformation, elaborated food products and others) with low rent costs and common infrastructure.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Catalonia has been hit hard by the crisis. There is not much work and the housing situation is practically unsustainable. We want to create a space that supports other projects on the surrounding community by ways of giving low rent for artists or small businesses that mind the ecology, restoring an unused space to bring new work and applied grassroots technology.<br/><br/>We want to create new solutions for the transition towns most common problems, and document and share this solutions with the rest of our extended activist and ecologist network.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are a group of about 40 people that wants to live or work there, and we hope that more people and projects will join as soon and the place is available. By now, we are still in the process of buying the place and we have gathered a part of the amount needed to sign the sale contract. We are working with a credit cooperative from Italy that will give us a credit of the same amount of money that we can gather. The amount of money we gather should be of at least 95.000 Euro, so they give us other 95.000 and we can sign the contract, and after that we will need to pay to the owner 2.100 more Euro per month, plus the credit.</p>
<p>We have already gathered 55.000 Euro, but still need 40.000 more. If we gather this 40.000 we will be able to pay the sign and have some money (30.000) for the initial restoration. From then on, we will have to pay around 3.000 euros per month during 10 years.</p>
<p>We want our friends to support us on the buying of the land, and we would like to have many small supporters in stead of a huge supporter, so we thought of asking for 5.000 euros from you , thought the mor ewe raise the easier it will be to fix the space and reform it. It is likely that we will be able to buy the place without your contribution, but if for any reason this will not happen, we would use the money to recover the 30.000 euros of the reserve that we already payed.<br/></p>
<p>This is a very ambitious project but we think that we need to start thinking other ways of living and we have to be ready for the big crisis that is coming. We want to be a resource center for our near community and abroad, documenting and sharing experiences, giving workshops and creating employment for the local community.<br/></p>
<p>Our space wants to be open to new projects and initiatives, being the stable home of 20 families and several other people for short time (like you!) and giving low price rents for small local businesses that help on this transition.</p>
<p>We want to be a networking space and welcome people that wants to do smaller residences of 2 or 3 months in the place. That's why many of the pledges are to enjoy locally: we want to meet you, or your friends! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need a lot of materials for the construction of the site, seeds for the garden and of course hand to build it up. If you want to work with us, please drop us a line. <br/></p>
<p>You can always organise benefits for our project, or spread the message of this campaign to other people.</p>

<p>This year several of our ""Racin' Rams"" track team participated in the Mid-Atlantic games in early June and earned spots at the National Junior Disability Championships (NJDC).  Our athletes qualified to throw shot put, discus, and javelin, and to race in the 100-, 200-, 400-, and 800-meter wheelchair races.  See more about the team at<a href=""http://www.bridge2sports.org/index.php/programs/trianglearea/track-field"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bridge2sports.org/index.php/programs/trianglearea/track-field</a> .  </p>

Together with 2 partners of mine, Harvey and Raymond, we share the same passion for innovation in healthcare and pharmaceutical products. We work as pharmacists in different hospitals. Over the years, we have managed to come out with some cool and innovative products.W-H-YBased on our working experience, we noticed that the patients in the hospital have been facing discomfort and inconvenience using the conventional intravenous (IV) stand. The inconvenience includes: 1) Patients difficult to Mobilize freely especially when they need to go to Washroom or go up/down Staircase2)Congestion in lift when patients travel by lift3)Limitation of Space between Beds in wards4)Backflow of blood when IV bags carried fall5)Fall injuries due to IV drip line tangled by IV stand rollers.SO..This is not the quality of life of patient that we would like to see. So it comes to a question: IS IT TIME FOR A BETTER IV STAND?W-H-A-TLet me introduce to you guys our prototype, the Multipole. 

It is not just another IV stand, it is a convertible IV stand. It is different as
1)It can be diassembled (Upper part as a portable pole that holds IV bag/blood bag; lower part as walking stick (optional) to assist weaker patient)
2)Light. It weights only about 0.6kg on its own. With IV bag, it is around 1kg.
3)Ergonomically design.
4)Easy to be put on/taken off. Convenient for patients who have urgency to go washroom. 
5)Can be worn on any shoulders.
6)Safer. IV bag will not fall and IV drip line will not be tangled by rollers.
This Is For...
Main target populations are:- 1)Patients encouraged to ambulate2)Post surgical patient3)Patient on painkiller/chemotherapy4)Patients without guardian5)Young patients6)ElderlyHowever, when it is not dissembled, it can still function as a normal IV stand just like a conventional one which can be used by all patients.Basically...To summarize, Multipole is much more convenient, safer and time saving for patients who need IV administration rather than pushing the conventional one-piece IV stand around.Why Fund Us?With this product, we can tackle a lot of problems and issues in the hospital. However, we know there are still rooms of improvement for this product. Currently, for the prototype, we are only using PVC and some recycled household materials due to financial restraint. We know this will not meet the required criterias of medical devices used in hospital setting.Our Plan...In initial phase, we intend to evaluate this product at my current hospital which is Hospital Queen Elizabeth, Kota Kinabalu. In later phase, we are hoping to bring this to next level where more hospitals or daycare centers can use our products. How You Can HelpTo make this happen we need to produce a final batch of products with:1)Refined design2)Suitable material such as polypropylene (PE) and aluminium.3)3D printing technology (optional)Everyone has get used to the conventional IV stand which is there for centuries even though patients are facing so much inconvenience. It is time for a change. And this is where you guys can play a part in. Please lend us a hand and support us.

<h3>What got this all started?</h3>
<p>Well, it was a simple question that I asked to Lorrie Brilla, PhD.: ""Could Structural Integration ever become part of the research she conducts at Western Washington University?""  Her reply was simple, unhesitating, and an enthusiastic, ""yes"". You see, Lorrie has had positive results from Structural Integration, and as a professor of kinesiology, she has a professional interest in seeing the ideas of SI tested. </p>
<p>Within a few months we had a research design, and now, just about a year later we are nearly ready to begin the project.  We only need to cover the costs of the 150 SI sessions, plus the associated costs of running this crowd funding campaign. </p>
<p>This is where you come in.<br/></p>
<p>Your generous contribution to this project insures that it will go forward. This is an all-or-none campaign, which means if we don't meet the goal of raising $23,000 the project will not go forward, and your money won't be spent. This also means that you can give generously without fearing that your donation will be wasted. Most importantly however, you can feel great about contributing to a project that we hope will make a major contribution to validating the effects of Structural Integration and to increasing the public's awareness .<br/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>An Important Opportunity to Help Research Get Done</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Scientific research is needed to support the claims of Structural Integration</li>
<li>With evidence-based research Structural Integration can gain wider acceptance</li>
<li>An easy, exciting, and direct way for individuals to support independent  research</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div><h3>More About this Community-Based Partnership</h3></div>
<div><ul>
<li>This campaign will pay for the cost of doing 150 SI sessions as well as the costs associated with hosting the campaign through indiegogo</li>
<li>WWU will contribute the experimental design, testing equipment and labs, and data analysis needed to complete the project, as well as publishing submissions to journals and conferences</li>
<li>The Rolf Institute of Structural Integration has generously donated $5000</li>
<li>Your financial support can make this research happen<br/>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
<p><b>You can read the full research prospectus <a href=""http://www.rolfingworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Research-Prospectus_Structural-Integration_ver1.2_Feb2014.pdf%20%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $23,000 to cover the SI sessions and costs associated with the indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p>As an expression of our appreciation for your donation we have some cool gifts to give. Check them out over there on the right hand side of the page.</p>
<p>The total breakdown of expenses are as follows:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>SI sessions - $18,000</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees + credit card processing - $1500</li>
<li>Video production - $1500</li>
<li>Gifts - $2000</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact: Validating SI and Getting it on the Map</h3> <p>With this project everyone wins. The Goal is to publish and present the results in journals and conferences.<br/></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>SI practitioners through their contributions have a chance to be a force in gaining acceptance for their work<br/>
</li>
<li>Clients can trust that the claims of Structural Integration rests on solid evidence</li>
<li>Researchers begin building a foundation that can support further inquiry for years to come</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Frankly, I hope the biggest challenge we face -raising the money to go forward- won't be much of a challenge at all. We have 40 days to get it done, and I won't rest until we reach the goal. That is my commitment.</p>
<p>My hope is the community of SI practitioners will see it similarly, realize the potential of this opportunity, and get behind it. We need everyone to help the dollars flow by spreading the word.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help us get this research done. </p>
<p>So, please </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Make some noise about your campaign - tell your colleagues, friends, family members, and clients.</li>

You can read the full research prospectus here

   What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $23,000 to cover the SI sessions and costs associated with the indiegogo campaign. 
As an expression of our appreciation for your donation we have some cool gifts to give. Check them out over there on the right hand side of the page.
The total breakdown of expenses are as follows:

SI sessions - $18,000
Indiegogo fees + credit card processing - $1500
Video production - $1500
Gifts - $2000


  The Impact: Validating SI and Getting it on the Map With this project everyone wins. The Goal is to publish and present the results in journals and conferences.


SI practitioners through their contributions have a chance to be a force in gaining acceptance for their work

Clients can trust that the claims of Structural Integration rests on solid evidence
Researchers begin building a foundation that can support further inquiry for years to come



  Risks & Challenges Frankly, I hope the biggest challenge we face -raising the money to go forward- won't be much of a challenge at all. We have 40 days to get it done, and I won't rest until we reach the goal. That is my commitment.
My hope is the community of SI practitioners will see it similarly, realize the potential of this opportunity, and get behind it. We need everyone to help the dollars flow by spreading the word.


  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help us get this research done. 
So, please 


Make some noise about your campaign - tell your colleagues, friends, family members, and clients.
You can use the indiegogo tools to help spread the word!

Please don't hesitate to be in touch during the campaign! We will be :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>What is Anaplastology?</b>  It is a field that combines science, art, and technology in order to create facial or somatic (body) prostheses for patients who have suffered severe disfigurement due to cancer, traumatic injury, or congenital origin. Prosthetic treatment provides an alternative when surgical reconstruction is unachievable or not desired. Most importantly, it offers the possibility of some functional and psychological rehabilitation that is vital to a patient's well-being.</p>
<p>Many people, myself included, have never heard of anaplastology or don't a have a clear understanding of what this type of treatment involves. Unfortunately, this lack of awareness also exists among a considerable proportion of health care professionals. As a result, many patients are not informed about prosthetic rehabilitation as a potential avenue for treatment, and often those who may benefit from a prosthesis are not referred to an anaplastologist. Can you imagine being a burn victim or losing your eye to cancer, and going years before learning that you could have received care had you only been told about it?</p>
<p><b>You can help!</b> There are less than 200 anaplastologists practicing worldwide--they make up a small group of talented specialists who need your help to educate the world about existing patient resources. Your support will benefit not only anaplastology patients, but also the growth of the field. It is our hope that The Worthwhile Mile will bring attention to this important clinical practice, while also generating support for its advancement through research and education.</p>

The Worthwhile Mile is all about creating opportunities for people to engage in active, service-oriented adventures dedicated to improving awareness and support for worthy causes.This summer, the WM will deliver 3 long-distance cycling trips to generate support for the field of Anaplastology:

Why do we need your help?  How will we use it?Every dollar donated helps us execute these rides.Why is it important that we succeed in executing the Worthwhile Mile 2014? We are at the foundation level of forming a not-for-profit organization focused on:

motivates the adventure,
brings attention to the cause, and
produces new, infomed advocates! 
Over the next five years, we invite the public to share with us about patient populations and areas of health they would like to see represented by Worthwhile Mile adventures. If you have an adventure in mind and would like assistance organizing a campaign for the cause of your choice, contact The Worthwhile Mile. The opportunities are ENDLESS! Examples of heatlh topics and populations for which we aim to increase our advocacy efforts include (but are not limited to) Blood Disorders, Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (such as Sceroderma), Gender Identity & Transition Health, Violence-related physical injury or paralysis, and health needs of the short- and long-term homeless. How does YOUR CONTRIBUTION make an IMPACT this year?

<br/><p></p></div>","WaterStop Carts are mobile units that purify municipal water; our
intent is to replace the need for bottled water. Each mobile cart carries 50
gallons of water or the equivalent of 400-16 oz bottles of water (refilling a
cart’s tank is as easy as using a common hose). Carts use the same filtration
system used in bottled water for purity as well as taste and have a cooling
system. (One note about the video, it mentions using nano silver to line the plumbing...we will not be using this unsustainable substance.)Hello, my name is Nan Harris and I sold my co-op in
Manhattan to
finance WaterStop Carts LLC, a socially responsible, for profit business. Why?
Because our world is facing a clean water
crisis and it makes me angry that the bottled water industry has taken life’s
essential element and made a commodity of it! You can live longer
without food then you can without drinking water. We have designed a new delivery system with
the intent of replacing the unsustainable use of bottled water (we will not be
selling water, only the carts, filters and bottles).                            As consumers we are paying between 300 to 4,000 times the costs of tap water
when we buy bottled water. The average American spends over $250 a year on
bottled water. We also end up paying for the cost to our environment
of carbon released and the oil and water used in manufacturing and transportation.
Why
are we paying this? Because bottled water is just easier to find. Trying
to refill bottles from public sources is almost impossible and almost always
distasteful. We can change this!!!How do our carts solve this
problem?
“Accessibility
through Mobility”is the
foundation of our thinking at WaterStop. Our mobile water carts go where people
go, venues of all kinds. Sometimes we just say it’s “water on wheels”.The cart uses municipal water sources and the same
filtration system used by bottled water companies. It delivers purified, fresh tasting
water, it's like bottled water without the bottle. Refilling the tank, which holds 50 gallons or 400 – 16 oz bottles of

to keep the water just above room temperature. Standard filters are easy to
change and commonly found in hardware stores like Home Depot (WaterStop will
provide specialized filters in case of local water issues due to aging
infrastructure or contamination) As mentioned in the video, digital banners are mounted
on the cart and provide sponsorship opportunities so the cart can pay for
itself. In the second prototype, a video monitor will be added for more
sponsorship, entertainment and educational opportunities.
The Second Generation cart will also have Wifi so the cart becomes not
only a Water Stop but a Hot Spot as well. A solar tower will be
added to extend the battery life. Eventually, when solar can produce enough
energy to run our mobile cart, we will convert to solar completely. Two notes: the completed look of the cart will have a modern, sleek design and our website will not go up until we have completed the beta-test.





Why Are We Crowd Funding?
Our purpose in raising more funds is to start designing the next generation cart. We will use these funds to build five carts for a

a common problem in all 50 states. From this beta-test we will be able to complete the engineering of the next generation cart. Did you know that children in the US have

I'm attempting to bring the lens back into focus on the pure light that is birth, the natural and loving way. </h3>
<p>I want to honor my body and my baby for the immense power that each possess. I have been living the lifestyle of an environmentally friendly and conscious person for some time now. Vegetarian by choice at the enlightened age of five and aware and intune with the non physical realm through meditation and observance of nature in it's pure state at a young age. I'm now 27 years of age healthy and happy. This is my first love child. My vision is to not only birth at home but to also support moms to be and provide education in their upcoming decisions about birth and the way they want to bring their babies into this world. You're not only supporting me and my baby, but paving the way for mothers and children all over the world who wish to normalize the process of pregnancy, birth and childcare. Spread the love, light and knowledge regarding educated choices in childcare from pre-conception and into adulthood. Raise our consciousness and our strength as enlightened and powerful beings    </p>
<p>When we reach our goal: I will be allocating funding for my midwives and doulas along with organic prenatal vitamins, foods and supplements to support a healthy, natural pregnancy. No drugs will be used and the money will be given directly to my care providers for their services rendered. A doula will help me to create my birth-plan and assist me with any lactation issues that may arise after birth and during labor will massage and provide me with constant touch to release the natural oxytocin our bodies produce when stimulated. My midwives will provide me with prenatal and postpartum care and patiently monitor my progress externally in a non-invasive manner as I labor naturally for an undetermined length of time. When the baby has decided it's time to arrive she will supervise the birth of the head and body while my partner catches the baby and reveals to me the sex of our baby. I will then encapsulate my placenta for use to combat baby blues and to aid in my natural recovery from birthing. We will use belly binding and warming techniques to encourage natural contraction and healing of the uterus provided by a separate doula. If we cannot meet our goal: I will use whatever we have raised towards the midwives fees for services. I will not be able to use the assistance of doulas in healing and aiding in the natural process of labor and recovery. I will still be birthing at home.</p>

We have decided that the best approach is a holistic one, and have embarked on a vast journey of research and synthesization in order to find all the pieces of the puzzle.</span></p>
<p><span>What we discovered has been both encouraging and unsettling. In order to really and truly tackle cancer -- in order to really get to the core of the problem and eliminate all possible contributing and detrimental factors -- we need more money than we have! </span></p>
<p><span>We have set the goal of this campaign at a tentative $7,000 -- but the reality is that we need much more help than this! Through our research, and through a cautious and conservative estimate, we have calculated the minimum amount we need to be at about $50,000! Any cent you can contribute will be received with much gratitude and immense love!</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>What We Know For Sure</strong><br/></span></h2>
<p><span>The first and foremost thing we need help funding is the removal of my mom's mercury tooth fillings, to avoid and alleviate mercury poisoning. She has had these for the majority of her life -- for 20 years, at least. The removal and replacement of mercury fillings is essential to any individual, but especially to those battling cancer. This procedure alone will cost about $20,000. The search for the right dentist -- who uses all the right, and safe, methods -- will be a part of this challenge.  </span></p>
<p><span>She also has problematic root canals, which are contributing to inflammation; these need to be fixed and improved -- as well other dental procedures that will arise while the mercury fillings are being replaced. </span></p>
<p><span>The next thing we need to fund are blood tests. The types of tests which are suggested -- in order to really see what one's body needs, on an individual level -- are only done in private clinics and cost about $500 each, or more; We have marked out at least three specific tests which she requires -- as per the recommendation of experts in the field.</span></p>
<p><span>A holistic treatment approach requires a consultation with and treatment by a medical professional. This is not presently covered by insurance (which we have very little of!), so we are budgeting travel expenses to one or two chosen locations (in the U.S. or abroad). With conservative estimates, this can cost us $1,000-$2,000.</span></p>
<p><span>Another large cost we are incurring is the switch to completely organic produce, as well as high-quality supplements. Although we have been eating organic produce regularly for the past year or so, the switch to being 100% committed to this lifestyle, as well as the added weight of purchasing supplements (such as B12, B17, Micro-algae, Chaga and Reishi mushrooms, amongst several others) is contributing to us incurring a high cost.</span></p>
<p><span>Our next challenge is to test her living space for EMFs, and consequently clear these our from her environment. One outlet filter can cost about $150, and she will require more than one -- alongside the actual inspection.</span></p>
<p><span>We will need to install a shower filter for her, in order to completely eliminate chlorine from entering her body.</span></p>
<p><span>We already gather all of our drinking and cooking water at a local spring -- so that is well taken care of!</span></p>
<p><span>My mom will also need to replace all her cookware, getting rid of everything that is non-stick. Although she has already begun this process slowly over the past year, we now need to truly get rid of anything that can contribute any chemicals into her food. We ask you to help us here because we will only be purchasing one or two items in each category of cookware -- but the costs are  higher than we anticipated at this time in our lives!</span></p>
<p><span>We will also need to purchase items that will replace anything chemical in the household in terms of cleaning or personal care products. This includes everything from body lotion to floor cleaner. Although we make our own homemade versions of several things, and are already well on this path, the complete and utter elimination of anything but will be a larger challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>The holistic process also places great emphasis on the spiritual side of one's life. For this reason, we already have, and will travel to renowned spiritual healers wherever and whenever possible, as well as undergo much needed internal work, ourselves.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>What We Will Give Back to You</strong><br/></span></h2>
<p><span>In the past year or so, I (Anna) have been on a journey to teach people in my community about the chemical-free lifestyle. At the time, I had no idea that this journey would become so personal. As a part of this mission with my mom, I have vowed to spend even more time devoted to researching and synthesizing the necessary information for her recovery -- and for others living with, and treating, cancer. As part of this fundraising campaign, I ask you to help me devote my time to this -- I have quit my job -- so that I can bring all this information to the forefront that much quicker.</span></p>
<p><span>In exchange for your love and blessings, you will see me bring all this information to YOU, as well!

<p>This work invites readers on a journey through realms of history and philosophy - as well as salient theories of Ayurveda and Chinese medicine - that are relevant to yoga and its therapeutic gifts. </p>
<p>Moreso, its a book about different worldviews, embedded in health practices and paths of personal development. A gesture pointing to the wisdom underlying many traditional healing systems. </p>
<p>Beyond the limits of knowing is the source of healing - the root of our being. On this journey, self-care remedies and holistic and therapeutic principles will be highlighted. Diet, herbs, massage and yoga  will be discussed as they pertain to various life cycles, seasonal regimens and health concerns - including perinatal care and men's and women's health.</p>
<p>The book will serve as foundation for yoga educators, CAM students/providers, as well as the educated public. It is intended as the first volume in a series exploring the essential points of traditional healing and yoga. The focus of this work is on foundational theory, with successive volumes detailing pathology (patterns of imbalance) and therapeutic interventions. My goal is to create a valuable resource, a guide to accessing some of the available traditional sources and a pithy reference work, peppered with hints and examples of self-care strategies.</p>
<p>I'm driven by the prospect of creating a fun and engaging, yet informative guidebook. I want people to be both allured and educated, and also to have a resource for educators to teach from.</p>
<p>The monetary goal is meant to provide means for writing, research, editing and design.</p>
<p>After a deliberate decision to leave writing (publishing) aside for ten years, I was left open to study and practice traditional healing. Involved in research and curriculum development, I've had more time to reflect upon and engage this dialogue. I'm prepared to devote the time to author a more lengthy work, with an editorial focus of making it accessible and reader-friendly.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge I believe will be neither editorial nor related to design, but rather in allocating time. Several friends and individuals have suggested I initiate this project, but with a busy clinical practice and family life, setting aside time presents as the main obstacle. With the support of the community through this platform, I'll be able to see it through to publishing.</p>

<p>In our world today, there are a lot of challenges that even the strongest of girls faces - threats to her health, her economic security, her family and community, her confidence, and the long-term sustainability of her home, planet earth.  These threats are created by adult-driven institutions and systems, so how is a girl supposed to stake her claim to a just, sustinable, prosperous future? </p>
<p>Full Circles Foundation is one answer.  Full Circles Foundation is a long-term, holistic, entrepreneurial empowerment track in the Southeastern U.S. that grows “strong girls, a fair economy, and a healthy earth.”  We ally with families to offer a community-powered continuum of programs to girls facing structural obstacles to realizing their full potential.  This continuum fosters participants' personal wellness, community efficacy, and understanding of and appreciation for the interdependence of life (ecological literacy).     </p>
<p>In the summer of 2011 a team of six people initiated the first phase of the FCF vision.  They dreamt of an organization - a community, really - dedicated to building integrated, scalable, long-term solutions to gender, economic, and ecological crisis by focusing on one of the most powerful sources of energy the world has:  girls.  The vision began with the pilot Full Circles Foundation program, Strong Camp, in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Strong Camp, a six-week summer program, illuminated the connections between personal, community, and environmental health for 25 girls ages 5 through 17. </p>
<p><span>The pilot was made possible by the enthusiastic investment of fiscal sponsor Grand Aspirations, a social enterprise incubator that supports, connects, and empowers young people who are creating innovative, self-sustaining initiatives at the intersection of climate and energy solutions, economic security, and social justice (</span><a class=""smarterwiki-linkify"" href=""http://www.grandaspirations.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.grandaspirations.org</a><span>).  </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Our Opportunity</strong><br/></span></p>
<p>This year, FCF Raleigh has returned with the second Strong Camp (and we have a new sister program in Lexington, Kentucky!).  We have an amazing team of instrcutor-fellows (whom you can meet <a href=""http://solutionaries.net/2012/06/06/meet-the-2012-full-circles-raleigh-instructor-fellows-10-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) who are working hard to provide another summer full of empowerment for 40 girls, some returning and some new!</p>
<p>Strong Camp is comprised of three two-week units:  Strong Self, Strong Neighbor, and Strong Home.  </p>
<p>Strong Self focuses on the most important relationship of all: the relationship that a girl has with herself.  In this unit, we foster personal wellness in physical, emotional, cognitive and social forms. </p>
<p>Strong Neighbor emphasizes the importance of a girl's healthy relationship to her neighbors, from those who share her home to those who live on the other side of the world.  In this unit, we foster efficacy; that is, the sense of having a stake in one’s community and the confidence and tools to impact it positively. </p>
<p>Strong Home focuses on a girl's relationship with her home, from her backyard or local park to the earth at large, which we all share.  In this unit, we foster an appreciation and understanding of the interdependence of life, both as a physical reality and as a framework for living. </p>
<p>Strong Camp meets a practical, immediate need of low-income Raleigh families by providing enriching, sliding-scale summer programming.  Just as important, FCF builds long-term, transformative relationships with participants and their families around the mission of ""strong girls, a fair economy, and a healthy earth.""  These relationsihps will be the foundation for launching future FCF programs.  </p>

<strong>Provide Six-Weeks of Entrepreneurial Summer Programming for 35 Girls Facing Strutural Obstacles:  </strong>Your investment will also help Full Circles Foundation cover materials expenses - like the up-front materials costs for our microventures!  Each unit of Strong Camp features a ""microventure"" - a project in which participants' learn how to make and sell a product.  FCF participants have made hand screen-printed t-shirts, hula-hoops, all-natural body products, hand-distressed jean shorts, and flower bombs!  By helping FCF cover up-front materials costs, you enable us to generate income for Strong Camp in a way that also advances our mission!      </li>
<li>
<strong>Strengthen Our Innovative Model:  </strong>Full Circles Foundation is only in Phase 1 of our vision.  Later Phases include an apprentice program and student owned and operated cooperatives.  Developing and launching these Phases will be key to FCF's long-term viability.  Your investment will provide capacity for us to continue the research and partnership-building necessary to launch these latter Phases.    </li>

<strong>Replicate</strong>:  In 2012, a second FCF pilot was launched in Lexington, Kentucky.  FCF has been approached this year by even more Southeastern communities excited about the FCF model and interested in replication of Phase 1.  With a vision as ambitious as ours, the process is as important as the goal.  In order to grow responsibly, FCF needs capacity to support new communities replicating our model.  Your investment will help us do this.</li>

<h1><strong>What is MADDIE Alert?</strong></h1>
<p>Its a unique device that locks and alarms doors and windows, it physically stops an intruder from entering, it does not require any tools to fit it and  can be used over and over again. The strap is anti slash proof and extremely strong. You can use it on any door or window in your home or while on holidays in accommodation such as hotels, dorms, caravan and motor homes.</p>
<p>If the door or window has a handle, MADDIE Alert will lock and alarm it.</p>
<h1><strong>How strong is MADDIE Alert</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Please see our Gallery and a demonstartion of MADDIE Alert towing a 3 ton landrover. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dont forget the strap is also antislash proof, we achieved this by incorporating steel wires into the strap. When testing the strap on doors and windows the handles would always break before the strap would seperate.<br/></strong></p>
<br class=""template oembed""/><h1>Why support MADDIE Alert?</h1>
<p>If MADDIE Alert stops one intrusion or one abduction, then this project has been worth while doing, I hope you feel the same. You can help bring MADDIE Alert to the world by being the very first to own one!</p>

<p>In order to make MADDIE Alert affordable to everyone we need to manufacture at least 5,000 devices on our first order.

<p>When researching MADDIE Alert we learned very quickly how cruel certain people can be and are towards children and especially those involved in child abductions. While my children were not harmed I did experience the feeling of terror and it is still very fresh in my mind. I can only imagine what a parent experiences when their child is taken. We came across some great people who are passionate about stopping any harm or exploitation of children such as Parents and Abducted Children Together known as PACT in the UK,  the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the USA and the the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCA).</p>
<p>Our admiration for these groups dedicated  to helping parents and the protection of children has created in us a need to help them. As a result we will donate a royalty towards PACT, NCMEC and the ISPCA from the sale of every MADDIE Alert device.</p>

<h1><strong>Why is MADDIE Alert different from other alarms? </strong></h1>
<p>A hard wired or wireless alarm in most cases is triggered by a power surge, traffic vibration or an animal.</p>
<p>With MADDIE Alert you can be guaranteed one thing, if the alarm is triggered, someone has opened a door or window and what is  more they will not be able to come through that door or window because the device physically stops entry.</p>
<p>What also makes MADDIE Alert so unique is that it is mobile and requires no tools thus providing you and your loved ones with security while on the move.</p>

<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. How long will MADDIE Alert last.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. One side of the Surface Patch has a very high strenght adhesive that sticks to a wall or glass panel, the other side of the Surface Patch consists of engineered locking heads that engages with corresponding locking heads on the strap. The strap and Surface Patch can be engaged and disengaged up to 1,000 times.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Can the Surface Patch be removed from a surface and reused.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No. The Surface Patch adhesive can only be used once. The Surface Patch is a very high strength pressure sensitive adhesive, it cures when it comes in contact with any surface.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. How do you get the Surface Patch off a wall or window panel?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The Surface Patch when applied is permanent. You can get the Surface Patch off with some brute force but it is meant to stay on. I have been asked many times how will a hotel or holiday complex owner react to finding a Surface Patch stuck to their wall, I think I would say, if the premises I am staying in had adequate security measures to protect me, my property and loved ones then I would not have to use MADDIE Alert. I have designed the Surface Patch to be transparent so it is less obtrusive and almost camouflaged with the surface it is applied to. If I am staying in a property and there is a Surface Patch already on a wall adjoining a door or window, I'll be saying ""Happy days"", I will not have to use my own Surface Patch.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. Will an intruder just cut the strap?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. The strap has been designed as an anti slash proof strap. The strap incorporates steel wires running through it which stops a knife cutting it. In most illegal entry scenarios one can be sure that when the MADDIE Alert alarm and flashing strobe light activates, that intruder will be running!</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How loud is the MADDIE Alert siren?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. It is  loud, 130 decibels that is very painful to the ears. Do not  forget in addition to the alarm there is a high intensity flashing red light..</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How strong is MADDIE Alert?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It will take 350 pounds of shear holding power to break the connection on MADDIE Alert.  In actual fact, every time we tested the strap to breaking point it was the window or door handle that would break.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. How do I get more Surface Patches?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. Our online shop <a href=""http://maddiealert.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">maddiealert.com</a> will have plenty of stock and can be purchased using a credit card or pay pal.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Instead of using Surface Patches at home is there  any other way of permanently locking MADDIE Alert?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. Yes, we include in our MADDIE Alert device kit a <strong>FREE</strong> specially designed wall bracket that allows the thumb piece on the strap to lock to the wall bracket. The bracket can be easily screwed to a wall by any DIY person.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Can MADDIE Alert be used on motor homes, caravans etc?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> MADDIE Alert works very well on these. We  came across some scary stories of criminals targeting people who holiday in motor homes. These vehicles are renowned for having little or no alarmed security.</p>

</div></div>","What is MADDIE Alert?
Its a unique device that locks and alarms doors and windows, it physically stops an intruder from entering, it does not require any tools to fit it and  can be used over and over again. The strap is anti slash proof and extremely strong. You can use it on any door or window in your home or while on holidays in accommodation such as hotels, dorms, caravan and motor homes.
If the door or window has a handle, MADDIE Alert will lock and alarm it.
How strong is MADDIE Alert
Please see our Gallery and a demonstartion of MADDIE Alert towing a 3 ton landrover. 
Dont forget the strap is also antislash proof, we achieved this by incorporating steel wires into the strap. When testing the strap on doors and windows the handles would always break before the strap would seperate.
Why support MADDIE Alert?
If MADDIE Alert stops one intrusion or one abduction, then this project has been worth while doing, I hope you feel the same. You can help bring MADDIE Alert to the world by being the very first to own one!

<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-vk0PZ73Y68%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-vk0PZ73Y68&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-vk0PZ73Y68%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Three years ago our son
Landen was born with a severe heart condition.  We were shocked and
devastated when doctors told us that he was not expected to live to his
first birthday. Our little baby boy had a hard fight ahead of him. To symbolize
the courage he would need we put a stuffed lion in his bed and we gave him the
middle name Lion. To us, the lion stood for strength, courage and hope, all of
which we knew our son had, and would need in his fight to survive. </p>
<p>When Landen was two months
old, the doctors found out that his heart condition was caused by a rare
disorder called LEOPARD syndrome, a RASopathy. By this time, our little Lion
was in end-stage heart failure. Doctors gave us a choice: we could either take
him home and enjoy what little time was left, or try for a heart transplant. We
knew our little Lion had more fight in him, so we listed him for a heart
transplant. On Mother’s Day, at 3 months old Landen received his life-saving
gift and also another unexpected gift. Our donor family sent a little stuffed
lamb that matched our son’s Lion perfectly, it had been in their daughter’s bed
while she fought in the hospital. We now say “Our strong lion has the heart of
a little lamb.”</p>
<p>Three amazing years later,
we are still grateful for every day we have with our son, but with this
gratitude comes unending oversight and heartfelt work. For example, our son
takes multiple life-saving medications several times a day and his
prescriptions are adjusted frequently. Landen has 11 doctors and has had
multiple hospital stays and surgeries. He also has a feeding tube and other
medical equipment with which I keep detailed records of his daily calories and
fluid needs, and track his heart rate every day.  One night, exhausted
from organizing, tracking and managing Landen’s medical needs, I thought to
myself, ""There has to be a better way… something easier, more convenient
and more accurate."" The Pocket Physician was created.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/316816/files/20140118215259-lionheart3.jpg?1390110779"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4><br/></h4><h3>Achieving the LionHeart Vision</h3>
<p>There is a better way to
take care of personal and family medical needs, and our goal is to make better
tools accessible to those who need it most. The LionHeart team strongly
believes that the Pocket Physician will improve the quality of life for all
involved. We are absolutely confident in our ability to make a product that is
secure, private, and versatile.  The app
will also be great for those who are just starting to do their own medical care
such as teenagers and young adults.  Ultimately this application will
provide a strong step towards unifying a very underdeveloped segment of the
medical market: personal medical technology.</p>
<p>Knowing first-hand, the
financial struggles those who have or take care of someone who has a medical
condition can have, with co-pays, reoccurring medical bills, the cost of
medications and medical equipment, we want to make this app available at no
cost. In this way we will be able to reach a large audience and thereby be in a
position to standardize these important tools. In order to achieve our vision,
we will need the support of investment such as crowdfunding. This is
a worthy cause and we encourage you to join our team. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Mobile Features and Benefits</h3><div><br/></div><p></p><ul>

put together the mobile app framework as well as the best team to do it. Our
highly qualified development partner, TekVitals, has a strong stake in this
project and has already put together the framework to make a successful
application. TekVitals specialty is in medical software applications. They are very familiar with HIPAA regulations, and they also employ leading compliance
experts who will consult on this project. Much of the risk in creating a mobile
application is mitigated by this strong coalition, and by the preparation that
has already been done.</p><p>TekVitals CEO, Ryan Bakow, is a strong believer in this project The Pocket Physician, he says:</p><p></p><p><i>“When I first heard Tammy’s story and her idea, I was immediately
struck by her passion and her vision for this project. Tammy knows firsthand
the struggles millions go through in caring for loved ones. I pledged to her my
full support, and I stand by my promise. This application has the potential to
make real change and to me is a worthwhile cause to support.”</i></p>

</ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many risks
involved with a project such as this. However, we feel extremely confident that
we can mitigate each one and build a successful product.  The principle
risks are that: 1) the project development will go over budget and hinder the
launch. 2) our user base will not regularly use this app and/or see a need for
it. And 3) the application will not have enough flexibility to cater to all of
our customers. Concerning the first risk, we have partnered our development
with a company called TekVitals Medical out of Utah. They specialize in medical
software applications and have worked out a deal with us that assures we will
get the app finished on time and under budget. TekVitals is a valuable partner
and has a track record of delivering their products and services. Regarding the
second, we have invested our own time and money into considerable market
research. This has helped us to learn that not only is this app viable over
multiple customer types, it would be used on a daily basis. The third concern
is the most difficult, because although we want to be the “all-in-one” app
there are hundreds of conditions. We have worked to include all of the major
areas that need tracking, including things like blood sugar and heart rate. We
have also enabled a system to help us get real time feedback from our clients
so that we can continue to add major tracking elements for their benefit. We
have done our homework and we know we will be able to provide a top notch
experience.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>Hear from others</b></h3>

1 in 3 adults have high blood pressure and only ½ have it under control

Over 500,000 people in the United States rely on feeding tubes for
survival

116 million Americans regularly experience chronic pain, including
the 36 million Americans who suffer from migraines

1 in 100 babies born each year have a congenital heart condition

26 million Americans have diabetes, and 79 million Americans have prediabetes

1 in 300 boys and 1 in 333 girls will be diagnosed with cancer before
their 20th birthday

1 in 26 Americans will suffer from epilepsy sometime during their
lifetime
70%
of the US population takes prescription medication
Imagine if life, even with medical needs, were simpler and more
organized.  It can be.  Lionheart Innovations is proud to introduce
the industry’s first all-in-one mobile, medical application, the Pocket
Physician. Meant for caregivers, parents, and individual use, the Pocket
Physician will allow users to track vital signs and medical events, take notes,
store medical records, reference important literature, schedule appointments,
calculate expenses and more.  The vision
for The Pocket Physician was not to replace doctors and medical providers, but
rather to work with them to give them accurate and complete information.  Caregivers are already required to be specialists,

A Mom, A Son and a Lion's Heart
Three years ago our son
Landen was born with a severe heart condition.  We were shocked and
devastated when doctors told us that he was not expected to live to his
first birthday. Our little baby boy had a hard fight ahead of him. To symbolize
the courage he would need we put a stuffed lion in his bed and we gave him the
middle name Lion. To us, the lion stood for strength, courage and hope, all of
which we knew our son had, and would need in his fight to survive. 
When Landen was two months
old, the doctors found out that his heart condition was caused by a rare
disorder called LEOPARD syndrome, a RASopathy. By this time, our little Lion
was in end-stage heart failure. Doctors gave us a choice: we could either take
him home and enjoy what little time was left, or try for a heart transplant. We
knew our little Lion had more fight in him, so we listed him for a heart
transplant. On Mother’s Day, at 3 months old Landen received his life-saving
gift and also another unexpected gift. Our donor family sent a little stuffed
lamb that matched our son’s Lion perfectly, it had been in their daughter’s bed
while she fought in the hospital. We now say “Our strong lion has the heart of
a little lamb.”
Three amazing years later,
we are still grateful for every day we have with our son, but with this
gratitude comes unending oversight and heartfelt work. For example, our son
takes multiple life-saving medications several times a day and his
prescriptions are adjusted frequently. Landen has 11 doctors and has had
multiple hospital stays and surgeries. He also has a feeding tube and other
medical equipment with which I keep detailed records of his daily calories and
fluid needs, and track his heart rate every day.  One night, exhausted
from organizing, tracking and managing Landen’s medical needs, I thought to
myself, ""There has to be a better way… something easier, more convenient
and more accurate."" The Pocket Physician was created.Achieving the LionHeart Vision
There is a better way to
take care of personal and family medical needs, and our goal is to make better
tools accessible to those who need it most. The LionHeart team strongly
believes that the Pocket Physician will improve the quality of life for all
involved. We are absolutely confident in our ability to make a product that is
secure, private, and versatile.  The app
will also be great for those who are just starting to do their own medical care
such as teenagers and young adults.  Ultimately this application will
provide a strong step towards unifying a very underdeveloped segment of the
medical market: personal medical technology.
Knowing first-hand, the
financial struggles those who have or take care of someone who has a medical
condition can have, with co-pays, reoccurring medical bills, the cost of
medications and medical equipment, we want to make this app available at no
cost. In this way we will be able to reach a large audience and thereby be in a
position to standardize these important tools. In order to achieve our vision,
we will need the support of investment such as crowdfunding. This is
a worthy cause and we encourage you to join our team. Mobile Features and Benefits

In order to learn the needs
of the market, we sent a survey to 250 people, age ranges 18 to 70.  We
asked simple questions about their healthcare, and their need for a tracking
app like this. Even we were surprised by the results:  
Question:  In an
All-in-One Tracking App, what options would be useful?

Question:  Is having
ALL your families medical records and daily medical needs in one convenient
place beneficial?


Question:  How many
specific individuals do you know that could benefit from an all-in-one medical
tracking app?  
       
 Answers ranged from 2-100's, even 1,000sThe InvestmentLionHeart Innovations has already invested significant time and money to
put together the mobile app framework as well as the best team to do it. Our
highly qualified development partner, TekVitals, has a strong stake in this
project and has already put together the framework to make a successful
application. TekVitals specialty is in medical software applications. They are very familiar with HIPAA regulations, and they also employ leading compliance
experts who will consult on this project. Much of the risk in creating a mobile
application is mitigated by this strong coalition, and by the preparation that
has already been done.TekVitals CEO, Ryan Bakow, is a strong believer in this project The Pocket Physician, he says:“When I first heard Tammy’s story and her idea, I was immediately
struck by her passion and her vision for this project. Tammy knows firsthand
the struggles millions go through in caring for loved ones. I pledged to her my
full support, and I stand by my promise. This application has the potential to
make real change and to me is a worthwhile cause to support.”

Risks and Challenges
There are many risks
involved with a project such as this. However, we feel extremely confident that
we can mitigate each one and build a successful product.  The principle
risks are that: 1) the project development will go over budget and hinder the
launch. 2) our user base will not regularly use this app and/or see a need for
it. And 3) the application will not have enough flexibility to cater to all of
our customers. Concerning the first risk, we have partnered our development
with a company called TekVitals Medical out of Utah. They specialize in medical
software applications and have worked out a deal with us that assures we will
get the app finished on time and under budget. TekVitals is a valuable partner
and has a track record of delivering their products and services. Regarding the
second, we have invested our own time and money into considerable market
research. This has helped us to learn that not only is this app viable over
multiple customer types, it would be used on a daily basis. The third concern
is the most difficult, because although we want to be the “all-in-one” app
there are hundreds of conditions. We have worked to include all of the major
areas that need tracking, including things like blood sugar and heart rate. We
have also enabled a system to help us get real time feedback from our clients
so that we can continue to add major tracking elements for their benefit. We
have done our homework and we know we will be able to provide a top notch
experience.Hear from others

“This app would not only help me
and my children, but my family also, if they ever had to take over for me, they
would have everything they need at their fingertips.”

“There is such a strong need for
this app. I have a medically fragile child, this app will help me be able to
focus on her needs rather than worry about all of the paperwork and things I
need to keep track of and appointments, etc. This app will help me keep all
of her information in one place, rather than the multiple places I now have
it.”

<h2 class=""Standard""><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Maryellen Bowman. I am a Registered Nurse and fitness professional with over 25 years of experience in the industry.  I founded Strength Innovations, LLC in 2009 in order to launch Quick Click Weight Training System, a new product and program that transforms traditional barbell systems and takes them to a whole new level.</p>
<p>I conceived the idea for Quick Click while teaching group weight training classes. I watched my clients, especially women, struggle to change weights on the barbell to accommodate different exercises. I’m sure you can relate to their frustration. It’s a difficult process to load and unload the weights using clamps or springs. This changeover process slows and interrupts the flow of the workout, hinders the ability to sequence exercises to maximize effectiveness, and actually intimidates some people from weight training at all.</p>
<p>Inspired by what I had observed in my class, I invented a user-friendly weight training system that would allow for quick, convenient transitions in weight. The result is a product that loads and unloads in an instant and doesn’t require the use of clamps. It can be used by adults of all ages at home or in a fitness facility and in an individual or group setting.</p>
<p>After years of product development, I am proud to have secured a utility patent, manufacturers and distributors.  With your help, I can finally bring Quick Click to market!</p>
