<h2>About this project</h2>
</div>
<p>Owning several devices, or living with other people who own more than one device can pose some problems, especially when it comes to charging them. Here are the most common problems:</p>
<p><b>1) </b>Not enough electrical outlets to charge all your devices; family and friends have to take turns charging.</p>

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>Only 6 months ago, our team – Trendlift - set out to design a product that will be a huge improvement over the USB charging hubs available in the market.

<p>Many processes are involved in getting the Fishbone USB Charging Station made, packaged, and ready for sale at your favorite store. That’s why we need your support.

Video Chat and Remote Control


One-tap video chat feature is developed to minimize operating steps to just one. Face-to-face interaction between parents and kids is then easily achieved. Moving feature built inside breaks through limitation of distance and space. You can remotely control XIBOT with the app on your smartphone, wherever you are, at home or office, domestically or internationally, to enjoy family fun. Simultaneously, interactive fun is enriched with animal stickers and voice changer.

Smart Photography and Auto-Share to Social Media



Hands-free photography enables you to capture smiling faces and special moments. What makes XIBOT amazing is that she can help you auto-share photos to social media, and all your friends can see your status updates instantly.

MEET THE
TEAM



When we are children, we always dream to have a companion, a smart robotic friend. So, when the team starts our company, we set a goal, to be the first brand in smart robotics and serve families worldwide. We miss the dream in our childhood, and we want to make children's dream come true, to have a robotic friend.
Xibot is originally designed and the concept of edutainment is the DNA in product design and development. ""Loving Our Baby"" is proposed as the slogan, because we desire to express love to kids as sweet as parents. Lovingly and wholeheartedly, Xiaoxi Technology holds the entrepreneurial attitude of ""Patience Above Love"". Xiaoxi Technology aims to serve families worldwide: the combination of excellent children education resources and the concept of edutainment makes children grow up in a fun world.
These days, social robot is a hot market direction. But most of the social robots are  either too expensive or unintelligent. After more than 10 years development, we work with Foxconn to bring the best quality and smart robot to the world. At the same time, we make the price as low as possible, to achieve our goal: bring a robotic member to every family!

<h3>Introduction:<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Greetings! My name is Conor Teal, founder of <b>Cargo Cabins</b> (<a href=""http://www.cargocabins.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cargocabins.org</a>) in Eugene, Oregon. In 2013, I acquired my BA degree from the University of Oregon in Planning, Public Policy, and Management. Since graduation, I have been working on designs for emergency and transitional housing for those living without shelter. <br/></p>
<p>Given the deficiency in affordable housing options available to the thousands of unhoused people in Oregon, Cargo Cabins is in the process of establishing itself as a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the goal of constructing studio cabins by re-purposing unused shipping containers.</p>
<p><b>Cargo Cabins believes that everyone deserves a safe place to sleep at night and it is our mission to provide self-sufficient housing for many of our unsheltered community members! </b><br/></p>
<p>One proven solution to the rising cost of housing is the <b>Tiny House Movement!</b> After discovering many success stories from those who have made the transition from a single-family home mortgage to a debt-free tiny house, I quickly recognized the logic in this type of housing for those living without shelter and wish to make this a reality for more people.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843965/files/20140908193858-TinyHouses-Infographic-1000wlogo.jpg?1410230338"" src="""" style=""width: 567.333px; height: 851px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">(Infographic by Ryan Mitchell via thetinylife.com)<br/></p>
<p>There are a wide range of tiny houses already available for sale, from DIY plans to established tiny house construction businesses. I was attracted to the concept of <b>shipping container housing</b> for a number of reasons, but namely for their abundance in shipyards around the world. There are <b>100,000's</b> of these containers lying <b>unused in ports</b> due to oversupply and shipping companies' preference for new units. The vast majority of these vacant containers are still water-tight and only have minor abrasions.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">(Photo by Izabela Reimers via Flickr Creative Commons)</p>
There is an established industry of modifying containers into office spaces, student dorms, restaurants, hotels, and single-family housing. However, there is a supply gap in applying these for emergency and mobile housing, particularly for those who struggle to afford their housing costs and those living without any shelter at all!<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Current Housing Crisis: </h3>
<p style="""">The cost of housing is often the highest expense in a family's household, but we pay these high prices because we all know that shelter is a necessity for well-being. Nevertheless, for 
millions of people around the world this expense has become unbearable 
and they have been forced to seek out help from family, friends, and local social services organizations for 
immediate shelter or they end up sleeping outside wherever space can be found...</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837328/files/20140905160348-AHAR_Cover.jpg?1409958228"" src="""" style=""width: 355.066px; height: 458px;""/></p>
<p>According to the most recent Federal AHA report, on a single night in <b>January 2013</b>, there were <b>610,042 people</b> <b>experiencing
homelessness in the United States</b>, including <b>394,698 people</b> who were homeless in
<i>sheltered</i> locations and <b>215,344 people</b> who were living in <i>unsheltered</i> locations... Even worse, <b>nearly a quarter</b> of the homeless population are <b>aged 18 or under</b>. <br/></p>
<p>Chronic homelessness is a daily tragedy that we are all aware of yet we feel helpless to solve. The truth is this crisis can be solved quite easily and quickly with a coordinated effort by local governments and individuals like you thinking:</p>

<p><b>*NOTE:</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to use locally-sourced recycled materials wherever possible during the fabrication process! We

<h3>Our Campaign Goal: </h3>
<p><b>We are hoping to raise $10,000 to build the move-in ready Cargo Cabins - Mobile1 model for an unhoused individual or couple in Eugene, OR!</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>All collected funds will be used for: purchasing materials, metal 
cutting/welding contractor labor costs, and city government permitting fees.</p></li>
<li><p>We intend to partner with community members, local businesses, and 
other nonprofit organizations to acquire material donations in order to 
expedite construction of additional cabins and lower production costs.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Mobile1 cabin is built under the $10,000 budget, the remaining 
funds will be given to the recipient in the form of requested amenities to help them become self-reliant (For instance, prepaid cell phones and a PO Box address are a common request by unhoused individuals).</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our first model will be given to the local Eugene nonprofit organization, <a href=""http://www.opportunityvillageeugene.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Opportunity Village Eugene</a> (OVE).</b></p>
<p><b>They are also crowdfunding for a new housing site called: <a href=""https://www.crowdrise.com/emeraldvillage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emerald Village</a>.</b></p>
<p><b>Please consider helping them meet their goal!</b></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Obstacles:</h3>
<p>As a new organization, Cargo Cabins is limited in production capacity, name recognition, and a lack of start-up capital. However, we have dedicated connections with many active community members and organizations in Eugene. We will have certified contractors lined up to make sure the houses are built to code. We also know where to acquire the recycled materials we need to build our first model, including a local source of used shipping containers.</p>
<p>The primary obstacle we are up against is capital funding...</p>
<p><b>We believe that crowdfunding is one of the best ways to finance public-benefit projects and so we are starting here with Indiegogo to make this happen!</b><br/></p>
<p>We will apply for government grants, connect with foundations and businesses, and recruit dedicated individuals for sustaining contributions as soon as we finalize our selection of board members and receive IRS 501(c)(3) status as a nonprofit organization. Our website will also eventually accept online donations so that we can achieve our vision of ending homelessness here in Oregon and beyond!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3> <p> </p>
<h4>What are shipping containers made of?</h4>
<p>
        Most shipping containers are made of rust-resistant Corten steel and have a 
hardwood floor. Some units have floors treated with pressurized chemicals and therefore need to be removed and replaced with non-toxic, insulated flooring. Cargo Cabins will use bamboo flooring for its durability and its benefits as a renewable plant product.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>How do you move a shipping container tiny house?<br/>
</h4>Mobile1 will be placed on 24' heavy-duty flatbed trailers to handle the weight of the containers and for mobility. There are a limited amount of trucks that can pull 5000+ lbs of weight, but a house will typically only need to be moved once by a professional transport group or vehicle rental and dropped off onto a site. If someone intends to move often, then a large truck is necessary and Cargo Cabins recommends a truck with a much higher tow capacity than the actual weight of the house and trailer.<br/><br/><h4><b>How are container houses any different than glorified RVs?</b></h4>Yes, the similarities between the two are overwhelming, however container houses are much more customizable, have a greater insulation value, built with mostly recycled materials, and Cargo Cabin's models will cost less per square foot than an equivalent-sized Recreational Vehicle.<br/><br/>Plus, container houses simply look better!<br/><br/><h4>Where can you park a tiny house?<br/>
</h4>
<strong>Private Property</strong>: A tiny house can be placed in a backyard, driveway, some city parking lots with monthly permits,
 or wherever space that local and state laws support RVs.<br/><br/><strong>Mobile Home Parks, RV Parks, and Campgrounds:</strong> The beauty of a tiny house is its mobility on trailers, so parking at RV campgrounds or public parks is often supported.<br/><br/><strong>Off-Grid:</strong> A Cargo Cabins studio may be parked in very 
remote locations, for instance in National Parks, since they are designed as self-sufficient units.  Greenhouses with hydroponic vegetable gardens can be placed on the roof for an even higher level of self-reliance.<br/><br/><h4>How do you securely lock a cabin?</h4>
The Mobile1 cabin will not have modified swing doors thus allowing for standard container locking mechanisms to be used on them. These locks will be purchased locally and provided to all new homeowners. The installed front door will have a bolt lock and the rear glass sliding door will have a common Round Face Mortise lock.<br/><br/><h4>How do I purchase a Mobile1 cabin for myself?</h4>
<p>As a public benefit organization, Cargo Cabins will only build studios for unhoused individuals by donating the units to social services organizations who will maintain them as rentals or delegate ownership. All donations through this fundraiser will be dedicated for this purpose.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested in moving into a container cabin for yourself, then email Cargo Cabins and make a request for a private sale. For now, only requests made in Oregon will be possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>If you have any other questions, please email Cargo Cabins at: admin@cargocabins.org!</b>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Stretch Goals:</h3>
<h4><b>Every $10,000 collected in this fundraiser will provide an unhoused individual or couple with their own home!<br/></b></h4>
<p>Nearly 15,000 people living in Oregon do not have access to stable shelter every night... We do not expect to place everyone in a tiny house, but we would like to provide as many people as we can with a home of their own!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3> Affordable Public Housing (48 units): ~$2 Million<br/>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844136/files/20140908220405-3D_Model_Image1.jpg?1410239045"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>Cargo Cabins intends to help build healthy compact city cores by developing self-sufficient affordable housing complexes on vacant publicly-owned lots.</b><br/><br/>All assets will be given to city authorities for management of these facilities at little expense to the public. Rent can be based on income and offer a new sustainable revenue source for struggling city government budgets. These complexes can be retrofitted and placed on-site in a fraction of 
the time and cost of traditional stick-built apartments while still 
exceeding current building efficiency codes.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/977308/files/20141101100413-3D_Model_Image2.jpg?1414861453"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Self-sufficiency measures for these developments will include: large solar photovoltaic arrays, on-site rainwater harvesting and filtration, personal storage units, geodesic dome greenhouses for communal hydroponic vegetable gardens, social services visitations, public transportation accessibility, and secure bicycle parking facilities.<br/><br/>We will apply regenerative design methods and help bring nature back 
into our cities by planting new trees and community gardens. These units can be extremely 
beneficial in natural disaster areas for emergency housing. Plus, the 
structures can be disassembled and reassembled without wasteful 
demolition practices.<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3> <p>We all know household budgets are tight, so if you can't help financially then please attend your local neighborhood association or city council meeting and encourage community leaders to prioritize on developing respectable low-income housing!<br/></p>
<p>There is no decent reason why we all must struggle to afford to live in our own homes. Consequently, hundreds of thousands of people in the United States have been forced out of stable housing when we all know:<br/></p>
<h2 align=""center""><b>Housing is a Human Right!</b></h2>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Please help spread the word of the Cargo Cabins fundraising campaign and consider moving into your own tiny house as a realistic opportunity to live debt-free!</b></p>

expedite construction of additional cabins and lower production costs.
If the Mobile1 cabin is built under the $10,000 budget, the remaining 
funds will be given to the recipient in the form of requested amenities to help them become self-reliant (For instance, prepaid cell phones and a PO Box address are a common request by unhoused individuals).


Our first model will be given to the local Eugene nonprofit organization, Opportunity Village Eugene (OVE).
They are also crowdfunding for a new housing site called: Emerald Village.
Please consider helping them meet their goal!

OVE has made national headlines for their creative 
planning designs and successful efforts in helping community members get
 off the streets and into their own homes:

Obstacles:
As a new organization, Cargo Cabins is limited in production capacity, name recognition, and a lack of start-up capital. However, we have dedicated connections with many active community members and organizations in Eugene. We will have certified contractors lined up to make sure the houses are built to code. We also know where to acquire the recycled materials we need to build our first model, including a local source of used shipping containers.
The primary obstacle we are up against is capital funding...
We believe that crowdfunding is one of the best ways to finance public-benefit projects and so we are starting here with Indiegogo to make this happen!
We will apply for government grants, connect with foundations and businesses, and recruit dedicated individuals for sustaining contributions as soon as we finalize our selection of board members and receive IRS 501(c)(3) status as a nonprofit organization. Our website will also eventually accept online donations so that we can achieve our vision of ending homelessness here in Oregon and beyond!

Frequently Asked Questions:  
What are shipping containers made of?

        Most shipping containers are made of rust-resistant Corten steel and have a 
hardwood floor. Some units have floors treated with pressurized chemicals and therefore need to be removed and replaced with non-toxic, insulated flooring. Cargo Cabins will use bamboo flooring for its durability and its benefits as a renewable plant product.

How do you move a shipping container tiny house?
Mobile1 will be placed on 24' heavy-duty flatbed trailers to handle the weight of the containers and for mobility. There are a limited amount of trucks that can pull 5000+ lbs of weight, but a house will typically only need to be moved once by a professional transport group or vehicle rental and dropped off onto a site. If someone intends to move often, then a large truck is necessary and Cargo Cabins recommends a truck with a much higher tow capacity than the actual weight of the house and trailer.How are container houses any different than glorified RVs?Yes, the similarities between the two are overwhelming, however container houses are much more customizable, have a greater insulation value, built with mostly recycled materials, and Cargo Cabin's models will cost less per square foot than an equivalent-sized Recreational Vehicle.Plus, container houses simply look better!Where can you park a tiny house?

Private Property: A tiny house can be placed in a backyard, driveway, some city parking lots with monthly permits,
 or wherever space that local and state laws support RVs.Mobile Home Parks, RV Parks, and Campgrounds: The beauty of a tiny house is its mobility on trailers, so parking at RV campgrounds or public parks is often supported.Off-Grid: A Cargo Cabins studio may be parked in very 
remote locations, for instance in National Parks, since they are designed as self-sufficient units.  Greenhouses with hydroponic vegetable gardens can be placed on the roof for an even higher level of self-reliance.How do you securely lock a cabin?
The Mobile1 cabin will not have modified swing doors thus allowing for standard container locking mechanisms to be used on them. These locks will be purchased locally and provided to all new homeowners. The installed front door will have a bolt lock and the rear glass sliding door will have a common Round Face Mortise lock.How do I purchase a Mobile1 cabin for myself?
As a public benefit organization, Cargo Cabins will only build studios for unhoused individuals by donating the units to social services organizations who will maintain them as rentals or delegate ownership. All donations through this fundraiser will be dedicated for this purpose.
However, if you are interested in moving into a container cabin for yourself, then email Cargo Cabins and make a request for a private sale. For now, only requests made in Oregon will be possible.

If you have any other questions, please email Cargo Cabins at: admin@cargocabins.org!



  

Stretch Goals:
Every $10,000 collected in this fundraiser will provide an unhoused individual or couple with their own home!
Nearly 15,000 people living in Oregon do not have access to stable shelter every night... We do not expect to place everyone in a tiny house, but we would like to provide as many people as we can with a home of their own!

 Affordable Public Housing (48 units): ~$2 Million


Cargo Cabins intends to help build healthy compact city cores by developing self-sufficient affordable housing complexes on vacant publicly-owned lots.All assets will be given to city authorities for management of these facilities at little expense to the public. Rent can be based on income and offer a new sustainable revenue source for struggling city government budgets. These complexes can be retrofitted and placed on-site in a fraction of 
the time and cost of traditional stick-built apartments while still 
exceeding current building efficiency codes.
Self-sufficiency measures for these developments will include: large solar photovoltaic arrays, on-site rainwater harvesting and filtration, personal storage units, geodesic dome greenhouses for communal hydroponic vegetable gardens, social services visitations, public transportation accessibility, and secure bicycle parking facilities.We will apply regenerative design methods and help bring nature back 
into our cities by planting new trees and community gardens. These units can be extremely 
beneficial in natural disaster areas for emergency housing. Plus, the 
structures can be disassembled and reassembled without wasteful 
demolition practices.
Other Ways You Can Help: We all know household budgets are tight, so if you can't help financially then please attend your local neighborhood association or city council meeting and encourage community leaders to prioritize on developing respectable low-income housing!
There is no decent reason why we all must struggle to afford to live in our own homes. Consequently, hundreds of thousands of people in the United States have been forced out of stable housing when we all know:
Housing is a Human Right!

Please help spread the word of the Cargo Cabins fundraising campaign and consider moving into your own tiny house as a realistic opportunity to live debt-free!

<p></p>
<div>This is a story about historical preservation, yes, and more, because the story continues.</div>
<div>Living among remnants of an earlier era, one gets used to graceful decay of wooden structures, built sparingly as the times dictated. Here also, are more substantial structures, like the Keeler Train Station, admired for their endurance and rugged beauty.</div>
<div>But, it was the swimming pool that made me realize I was taking it all for granted. I had heard the story of how it was hand dug in the 1920s (33ft × 86ft and 5 feet deep). Slim Hernandez, a long-time Keeler resident, was part of the building crew. I've heard that Hollywood honchos, like Fatty Arbuckle, visited the favored watering hole. (It was the first and only pool in Inyo County for a time.)  An unconfirmed story has Johnny Weismuller, the original Tarzan, practicing for the Olympics here.</div>
<div>This tiny town of about 60 people now, is reported to have once been home to 5,000 at its height in the 1870s. But, people left as the mines played out, the Owens Lake dried up, the somewhat grand Keeler Hotel burned down, the railroad withdrew,  the two-room school house emptied, the pool closed and commerce vanished. </div>
<div>What remains is a beautifully profound quiet in what has been called a living ghost town. People amazingly stop by from all over the world and find something charming here. They photograph the unique scenes, including the abandoned swimming pool, ringed by a weathered fence, two pretty little ragtag buildings and the little bell tower without a bell.</div>
<div>So, the dream is to preserve the historic buildings at the pool and bring back the water in the style of a natural swimming pool. A shallow shelf is created for plants: 50% water garden, 50% swimming area. No chlorine, the plants do the work. There are amazing examples on the internet if you look up ""swimming pond"" or ""natural swimming pool.""</div>
<div> A picture is worth a thousand words. This is how they have done it in Ibiza, Spain at Can Marti.</div>

</div></div>","CNET  |  Engadget | Digital Trends Designed by Architects, Manufactured by Techies Friday infuses cutting-edge design, functionality and security in the world’s most advanced Smart Lock. Designed by the worlds, perhaps most distruptive architects, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG IDEAS), who are behind Two World Trade Center & the new Googleplex, Friday combines design and technology in one package.   Complimenting any decor through unobtrusive design No tools needed to change battery - just use a plastic card (like credit card) We believe a Smart Lock should compliment your home rather than draw attention to a blinking gadget. Long term, we also believe that eco-systems and operating systems will serve as the connection point, negating the need for hubs or dongles, which will make installation significantly better. 
 

 
Forget your keys and grant access to anyone, from anywhere, at anytime. Get complete peace of mind knowing your house is protected by industry-leading security standards.

The Friday Smart Lock is perfect if you are renting out through home rental services  such as Airbnb or Homeaway. Instead of handing out physical keys, you can grant  time definite access via the app, giving you peace of mind of who has access to your home.
 

LIMITED TIME PRICING

<li>What is the retail price of the Stalactite 102? <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The cost in our website will be 2.895€ (plus VAT where applicable). Our Indiegogo supporters are definitely receiving special treatment for believing in what we do!</span>
</li>
<li>When will my Stalactite 102 arrive?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> We are already working hard to plan our supply chain and manufacturing operations to make sure you get your Stalactite 102 as soon as possible. Each pledge has an expected delivery date at which we will start to deliver. Shipping times may vary once the package has left but will be sent by insured courier mail where available. We hope the package will travel for less than a week between pick-up and delivery, along with tracking ID that you will be communicated.</span>
</li>
<li>Why isn´t shipping included?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Shipping prices vary by location and country. It will be easier to handle this step in personalized way. After Indiegogo campaign is over and we are ready to start shipping, we will contact you to require your shipping data and calculate the final shipping costs.</span>
</li>
<li>How much does international shipping cost?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Shipping for European countries will be calculated for each destination. No extra import taxes are required, as all taxes come included in the price. For non-EU destinations, a custom tax may apply on top of the shipping cost. We do not know exactly what the custom taxes may be, so that you will need to inquire and take care about these yourself, in need be. After our Indiegogo project ends, you will be asked to log into our website and pay the appropriate shipping charges.</span>
</li>
<li>How much will the print material (resin) cost?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Starting at 80€ our Standard version, Prototype &amp; Flexible version 90€ and Waxy 125€ (plus VAT where applicable).</span>
</li>
<li>How does the resin system work?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Can you leave the resin in the tray? You will just need to pour the resin in the Stalactite 102 vat, just enough to print your object. 5 or 6 mm of resin in the vat goes a long way. The colored shield will keep light entering the build area and help maintaining the resins fresh. We recommend emptying the vat after a long print and pouring it back into the opaque bottle, for longer shelf life (over 6 months). This will also allow the vat to keep in contact with air, which helps keeping it clean and non-stick.</span>
</li>
<li>Can the resin be burn-out, for lost-wax casting?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Yes! Our Waxy resin is designed to be used this way.</span>
</li>
<li>Does the resin need to be carefully handled? Do you have an MSDS?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> We have MSDS sheet for all our materials. We have formulated them from the get-go with user safety in mind. We will always strive to make them as user friendly and ecologically sound as possible. Our resins do not contain any solvent or VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) and are chosen to be as little irritancy as possible. As for handling them while they are in the liquid form, the stage where they are more reactive, we recommend using gloves so that you do not irritate your skin in case it´s specially sensitive, after curing and post-curing, the materials are rather inert, but do not recommend using them for prolonged food storage and handling.</span>
</li>
<li>Can you design with the print Software? What operating systems will be supported?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> The print software does not allow for a design phase. You will need to design the object in one of the many available softwares, such Sketchup, Z-Brush, FreeCad, TinkerCad... Once the object has been designed, you can export it to .STL format and this will be read into our print software, where it can be manipulated to fit the build area. We will try to have our software available in all major platforms, by the moment Windows versions are the priority.</span>
</li>
<li>How many parts can I print with 1 Kg of resin? <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This depends on what object volume you print. Our software will calculate for each object how much resin you will be using. In our experience, 1Kg of resin will last for many, many prints.</span>

The excellence we intend to convey through uncompromised industrial and product design. We opted to introduce innovative ideas and key improvements to pre-existing concepts that often did not deliver on what had been initially promised. We are now unveiling our desktop 3D Printer, designed from the ground up by our team of engineers and product designers. Be ready to be amazed!SPECS:

Minimum layer thickness down to 25 microns (hardware can support layers as thin as 10 microns).


High DPI (dot per inch) density on the X/Y plane (100 microns NORMAL mode, 50 microns FINE mode).


High quality precision components.


Mechanized aluminum and laser cut steel components.


Innovative decoupled dual peeling system (patent pending)


Proprietary software with fast slicing and automatic supports.


Wide choice of printing materials: currently up to 4 different resins with a variety of properties.


Build Area: 102mm x 76,8mm x 180mm

THE 3D PRINTING TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING FOR HIGHEST DETAIL AND QUALITYAlthough Laser 3d printers are an interesting solution for certain applications, our know-how in the field led us to develop our devices around the DLP technology, mainly for two leading properties:

Resolution: With DLP (Direct Light Processing) we can reach feature details of 50 microns, which is a six-fold improvement compared to Laser 3d printers that are limited by the geometry of the Laser beam (pointer diameter, varying shape, focus and raster speed).


Build Times: The Stalactite 102 builds each layer within a constant exposure time, making the size of the object within the X/Y build area independent of the build time. It doesn't matter how many objects you fit within the build area, print times will always remain the same, depending solely on the number of layers in the Z-axis.

that SensyBEE faces are </span><b>injection mold tooling</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> (for future devices) and </span><b>obtaining certifications</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> for the whole range which is almost in place and allow us to start shipping to all countries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The cost for these two processes are huge. Our minimum goal-amount reflects this cost. In order to guarantee delivery of the first devices in the next three months, and </span><b>to meet all the technical and production challenges, we require a
minimum of  $ 20,000. But our real goal is higher like our ambitions:</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-<span> 
</span>If we reach $ 20,000 we can already guarantee that we
shall release the other BEE-Control (4 different plug units are envisioned) and the Sensy-BEE (notably the RF version which is in finalization)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-<span> 
</span>Should we reach $ 35,000 or more we shall finalize the
additional gates and freeze design of our other sensors (air quality, humidity, movement, and a few surprises to expect!)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-<span> 
</span>Should we we reach $ 50,000 we can offer the complete set
of products, including a GSM gate to be completely independant from internet connections! </span></p>

reality: we wanted to control our home energy spending but we were tired of
cabling and dealing with IP networking requirements. We then discovered
the first RF modules and the ability to mesh in a home network very simply, and
started thinking we could develop </span><b style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">a complete solution which requires no
programming, no networking, no internet: something simple, reliable, with low
emission and low energy requirement.</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Also we are convinced that measuring is not enough, our solutions
PROACTIVELY play a physical role, with an active and autonomous contribution to
vampire energy harvesting: a smartgrid programmer can never take all
parameters into account, every minute, every hour or every day: so we’ve
decided to create a “self-programming energy harvesting” network, composed of
sensors to measure and detect, but also act like our active plugs, with the
<font color=""#E19600""><b>embedded intelligence at LOCAL level.</b></font></span></p>
<p><b><u>We wanted something simple and flexible</u></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In our vision, we wanted to have something which does not require any
remote control (for instance your mobile phone). Looking intensively at all the
solutions on the market, you can be assured a majority are still asking you to
perform actions via smartphone, tablet or PC: we provide a completely HANDS-
and MIND-FREE solution.</span></p>
<p><b><u>We also wanted something completely secured!</u></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have a secured control at all levels of interaction with the plugs,
sensors, and each extra device will automatically have a secure connection to
the network it belongs to.</span></p>

MAKE ENERGY SUPPLY ECONOMIES 
WITH NO EFFORT AND NO PROGRAMMING!  Our exclusive plugs and sensors will generate                                  “Beautiful Energy Economies!”                                                          B-E-E ""These devices have no specific target population, it is useful and needed for everyone around the world to think about energy conservation!""
   SensyBEE is ideal in private and professional use, and we shall welcome distributors willing to represent the company.Look at our specific bundles or contact us directly!    What makes SensyBEE different?Every product on the market is asking you to program - we don't!SensyBEE is  an extremely sophisticated but simple-to-use energy harvesting technology.- Energy savings all year long (nigths, weeks ends, vacation).- Flexibility because you don't need to program, the plug learns by itself !- Fast and low cost installation, with reduced impact on the environment.                 Immediately start to spare money in energy harvesting.
SensyBEE products are not another gadget asking you to think about how to take control of everything.SensyBEE products have the embedded intelligence to monitor energy consumption without any other programming need: just plug in and let work!Get rid of your smartphone, your tablet and PC : let SensyBEE help you to reduce energy waste  in a simple way!      We spare you the hassle of programming, you just unbox and plug! Our plugs and sensors shall automatically inter-connect to each other with no wiring, no programming : our embedded dynamic predictive software analyses automatically the need for energy, the planning, and makes local rules to kill vampire power consumption.                   Knowledge is power - get energy ON NEED ONLY!No monthly fee to pay for a service - just make economies!SensyBEE is more cost effective and easier than using conventional “smart” plugs, because we are not just metering. SensyBEE is proactively planning for you when a device can be totally switched off or not.And our optional sensors are increasing the comfort and directly controlling the activity at each strategic spot, and you can implement more modules upon your own preferences and needs!
SensyBEE means guaranteed ease-of-use with huge impact on your future energy bills!SensyBEE will help you cut standby costs dramatically : let's assume that every appliance you connect will be completely shut off about 12 to 20 hours per day, on working days, nigths, some week-ends and vacation,                         You can easily predict your own economies !SensyBEE will contribute with you to a greener world: you can easily bring your contribution to a safer environment and secure the fossil and natural resources long term,                       BEE pragmatic: stop using energy with no reason!                                                      What can SensyBEE do better for you?SensyBEE products will be a complete range of connected devices with one single interface, flexible and future-proof.   We’ve created a self-programming energy harvesting network, with the embedded intelligence at local level composed of interacting devices:• Different metering and energy harvesting intelligent plugs and more modules are envisioned.• Sensors for environmental parameters are to come: Temperature, CO, COV , Presence, Luminosity, Humidity, Noise Level...most are finished • Sensors for alerts: smokes, fire, intrusion, shocks or movements... prototypes are on the shelves but not finalized (need further design work and moulds)And a Dasboard is offered to supervise how efficiently the economies are made and to allow you to take full control.Easily get started - It's really plug-and-work!SensyBEE makes your life easier with no hassle of looking after details. Our PLUGS work as stand-alone vampire killers without external assistance. And this with unlimited flexibility!SensyBEE is easy to install and maintain:                  
“Out of the box and immediately ACTIVE and EFFICIENT”With SensyBEE you acquire Local Intelligence:• It acquires history automatically during the set up phase• Then it schedules all by itself the best economic scenario                   
""Completely HANDS- and MIND-FREE solution""                                                                            Use Worldwide!We’ve created the products with the International IEC connector, which is perfect for using the plugs in connection with any electrical or electronic device, such as PCs, printers, hifi and video. In addition we shall offer connectors and adaptors to any country standard – please have a look at our website SENSYBEE - Inspired Energy- we’ve sorted out a specific selection of articles to match any plugging situation.                                                        Unique Rotating Plug FeatureWe’ve created a “rotating plug” feature, with the benefit of orienting the plug on any device, for instance if there is a ventilation on the computer, you can easily match any kind of situation and optimize placement!Harvest energy and take control of your environment and comfort

 SENSYBEE detects you, not your smartphone! And matches your life habits
to assure you peace-of-mind!How does SensyBEE work?
SensyBEE
offers the latest LR-WPAN technology to provide trouble free operations. 
We are one of the first companies to adapt this standard within a

DEVELOPERS! 
We are
happy to share our knowledge with early subscribers. As a Backer you may be tempted to contribute to further developments and
we shall welcome and also reward your initiatives!Exclusively during our crowdfunding campaign an open Source Development Kit is available for developers: you can hack and customize, create your own development (Our Gateway and Web Front End are offered), make your own device do what you really want!

A
“developer” kit is available and it comes with:
- 
1 BEE-Control advanced plug -  Either 2 sensors and the crowdfunding series specific gate
- 
One specific IDE (to be downloaded from Synapse
portal)
- 
Full access to our support forum.                                                            Our python-gateway
for windows or linux Our multistandard gateway software allows to seamlessly connect to any cloud services of your
choice, among these:    Our Dashboard:
your energy management partner for a greener world

We recommend to use our
devices the way they have been imagined for:  let them make their own scheduling, adapt to
your lifestyle and, after a period, experienced users can easily set up their
own rules.


Real-time electricity and room parameters monitoring
Our plugs and sensors can be deployed and operated
with minimal costs because they shall automatically inter-connect to each other
with no wiring, no programming. They will report at regular intervals the data
they have acquired, in a local mode:  Real-time electricity monitoring, but not only! Other parameters like humidity, temperature, CO, COV, etc can be monitored upon your own preferences.                                                     Keep 100% control with the dashboardOur Dashboard will allow you to routinely perform checks and fine tune adjustments upon your own preferences and life habits: on-site Real-time DASHBOARD and Cloud monitoring are included.                   Monitor everything from everywhere in your premises
Our solutions are really simple, and you don’t need to
be a programmer to make the best use of it. PC, Smartphone and tablet can be used with our gateway but these are not necessary to start! Our responsive design dashboard will automatically match your device characteristics!
                                         Why do we need
your support?
We think SensyBEE is a
fantastic product range with huge potential,                                 and you can make it happen WITH US !As you understand, our project has already been partly financed by private supporters (including ourselves!), and we are now reaching a line where further investments only can contribute to make SensyBEE a complete range of interconnected devices.  Our goals are simple: the largest costs
that SensyBEE faces are injection mold tooling (for future devices) and obtaining certifications for the whole range which is almost in place and allow us to start shipping to all countries.
The cost for these two processes are huge. Our minimum goal-amount reflects this cost. In order to guarantee delivery of the first devices in the next three months, and to meet all the technical and production challenges, we require a
minimum of  $ 20,000. But our real goal is higher like our ambitions:
- 
If we reach $ 20,000 we can already guarantee that we
shall release the other BEE-Control (4 different plug units are envisioned) and the Sensy-BEE (notably the RF version which is in finalization)
- 
Should we reach $ 35,000 or more we shall finalize the
additional gates and freeze design of our other sensors (air quality, humidity, movement, and a few surprises to expect!)
- 
Should we we reach $ 50,000 we can offer the complete set
of products, including a GSM gate to be completely independant from internet connections! 
Every dollar raised through
Indiegogo will go directly to software improvement and manufacturing of the SensyBEE which shall be ordered.                                                   
What you get in returnWe are releasing the products at discounted prices for
early birds. Retail prices will be higher after the crowdfunding campaign.
Even if we don’t meet our goal we’ll still deliver the
perks. But we chose $80K (about 1000 units) as our goal because we think that’s
the minimum number of SensyBEE modules we need to manufacture in order to
launch the product in a timely manner and prove that our manufacturing quality
is excellent. 
During our Crowdfunding campaign we are also offering an open-source application and the ability to upgrade the
network and plugs to other applications: your imagination will motivate us,
please share with us! We shall welcome your feedback and we shall reward you for
the additional extensions you shall make possible with our devices.

                            We need your Help, thanks
for your support!                                              Challenges / Risks – our RoadMap
Production already began in March, as we are
currently testing dozens of our plugs in a real industrial environment.Should SENSYBEE meet its $80,000 funding goal we have everything in
place to ship by August this year. 
There will be more devices to offer in the near future and we kindly
ask our backers to watch our timeline vs. the anticipated planning.
We are keen to secure our backers the highest possible service in order to
customize the plugs and sensors they will purchase, now and in the future!

About IdeoVitra
Like most innovations the SENSYBEE concept started when facing the
reality: we wanted to control our home energy spending but we were tired of
cabling and dealing with IP networking requirements. We then discovered
the first RF modules and the ability to mesh in a home network very simply, and
started thinking we could develop a complete solution which requires no
programming, no networking, no internet: something simple, reliable, with low
emission and low energy requirement.
Also we are convinced that measuring is not enough, our solutions
PROACTIVELY play a physical role, with an active and autonomous contribution to
vampire energy harvesting: a smartgrid programmer can never take all
parameters into account, every minute, every hour or every day: so we’ve
decided to create a “self-programming energy harvesting” network, composed of
sensors to measure and detect, but also act like our active plugs, with the
embedded intelligence at LOCAL level.
We wanted something simple and flexible
In our vision, we wanted to have something which does not require any
remote control (for instance your mobile phone). Looking intensively at all the
solutions on the market, you can be assured a majority are still asking you to
perform actions via smartphone, tablet or PC: we provide a completely HANDS-
and MIND-FREE solution.
We also wanted something completely secured!
We have a secured control at all levels of interaction with the plugs,
sensors, and each extra device will automatically have a secure connection to
the network it belongs to.

Nous sommes fiers de vous présenter SensyBEE, un concept révolutionnaire pour vous faire économiser de l'énergie sans sacrifier votre confort.Nos prises et nos capteurs se déploient indifféremment à votre domicile ou dans votre environnement professionnel. SensyBEE est la dernière génération de prise connectée autonome dans la coupure des courants de veille.REALISEZ DES ECONOMIES DE FACON SIMPLE, SANS PROGRAMMATION !""BEE"" signifie ""Abeille"" en anglais (Beautiful Energy Economies = de Belles Economies d'Energie), et l'image associée de l'abeille est une façon de vous montrer que nous allons ""butiner"" partout ou l'énergie est consommée de façon anormale ou inutile, pour vous faire réaliser de vraies économies et contribuer à la protection de l'environnement !                                                           En quoi le concept SensyBEE est-il supérieur aux autres solutions ?SensyBEE est une gamme complète sophistiquée dans son principe mais finalement très simple à déployer :- pour réaliser des économies chaque jour de l'année (journée, nuit, vacances) sur les appareils en veille- flexible et sans programmation, la prise apprend toute seule !- Rapide d'installation avec un impact immédiat sur l'environnement (courant de repos inférieur à 1mW, bien meilleur que tout courant de veille classique).Tous les produits présents sur le marché vous demandent des efforts pour programmer.
Avec SensyBEE vous branchez et laissez agir !
SensyBEE n'est donc pas un Gadget de plus dans votre environnement, et il ne vous demande pas de réfléchir à comment en tirer le meilleur usage : il le fait tout seul.SensyBEE embarque une intelligence artificielle qui vous permet de vous affranchir de votre smartphone ou votre tablette, tout est simple !Nos prises et nos capteurs vont se connecter automatiquement entre eux, et le logiciel embarqué en mode local va réaliser un planning-expert pour moduler les allumages et extinctions des appareils qui lui sont raccordés.           Le savoir est embarqué pour les meilleurs résultats en local SensyBEE est un concept réellement intelligent, car il planifie pour vous.
SensyBEE va chercher l'économie optimale sans sacrifier votre confort, et vous le constaterez sur votre facture !SensyBEE coupe automatiquement toute consommation anormale (un radiateur électrique allumé alors que la fenêtre est ouverte) ou inutile (un écran en veille pendant 10 à 15 heures par jour).SensyBEE devient le gardien de votre installation pendant les nuits, les Week-Ends ou les vacances.                                                   SensyBEE en fait plus pour vous !SensyBEE est une gamme complète d'objets connectés qui répondront à un interface unique dans un réseau sécurisé et extensible :- les modules de mesure et réduction de consommation (dont les prises)- les modules qui vont analyser les paramètres de votre environnement (température, CO, COV, présence, luminosité, humidité, qualité de l'air et niveau sonore...)- Les capteurs qui peuvent alerter (fumée, intrusion, chocs ou mouvements, et plus encore à venir...)Le tout est piloté par un Logiciel de supervision qui est fourni avec chaque appareil, pour prendre le contrôle si vous le désirez.LES ""PLUS"" DU CONCEPTDEBALLEZ ET BRANCHEZ !Nos prises fonctionnent sans assistance, et vous rendent la vie facile !PAS DE ""BOX"" NI ABONNEMENT MENSUEL A SOUSCRIRE !Vous vous équipez de l'une de nos passerelles et vous n'avez aucun autre engagement auprès de la société IDEOVITRA. Nous n'allons pas vous vendre un service sur abonnement et revenir chaque mois vous expliquer comment réaliser des économies, notre système fonctionne complètement de manière autonome,  et le logiciel bénéficiera de mises à jour gratuites à télécharger. Ne réglez que les modules, et déployez au gré de vos besoins !UTILISABLE PARTOUT - GRACE AU CONNECTEUR INTERNATIONAL I.E.C.                                                          PRISE ROTATIVE - S'ADAPTE A TOUTE SITUATIONLA TECHNOLOGIE SENSYBEENous sommes l'une des premières entreprises à exploiter le standard LR-WPAN au sein de modules avec des capacités d'auto-apprentissage :- les prises et capteurs ont une intelligence embarquée en mode local et identifient la façon optimale d'allumer ou éteindre des appareils- le logiciel fourni permet d'agréger toutes les remontées d'informations pour les exploiter de façon logique- le réseau se déploie facilement et la maintenance est réduite au minimumet surtout SensyBEE VOUS détecte, et non votre smartphone ni votre tablette pour prendre les meilleures décisions !PRENEZ LE CONTRÔLE DE VOTRE ENVIRONNEMENT !Nos passerelles pilotent les prises et les capteurs et notre logiciel de supervision en ""responsive design"" vous permet de tout contrôler depuis votre smartphone, tablette, PC et même depuis un serveur cloud de votre choix (Clouds sur abonnements que vous pouvez souscrire directement auprès du prestataire).                                                  SENSYBEE AIME LES DEVELOPPEURSNous sommes heureux d'ouvrir nos développements aux utilisateurs avertis.

Nous vous recommandons d'utiliser nos produits tels qu'ils ont été conçus : pour être utilisés simplement, en les laissant créer pour vous le meilleur scénario de gestion électrique de vos appareils. Néanmoins après une période les utilisateurs passionnés seront tentés de créer leur propre algorithme,notre logiciel est là pour eux !Toutes les prises et capteurs remontent en temps réel des informations (température, humidité, luminosité, qualité de l'air, etc...) et vous pouvez en temps réel les analyser, en déduire vos propres règles de paramétrage.
Prenez le contrôle de votre environnement tout en maîtrisant votre confort et vos consommations !                                                      POURQUOI AVONS NOUS BESOIN DE VOTRE SOUTIEN FINANCIER ?Nous pensons que SensyBEE est un produit fantastique et vous allez nous aider à le lancer.Nos objectifs sont simples : nous devons financer les moules d'injection et l'obtention des certifications. Les coûts mentionnés dans nos objectifs sont élevés, et correspondent aux frais à venir pour les outillages et validations - soit minimum 20,000 euros qui nous permettent de garantir la livraison rapide des premiers produits.Comme vous le supposez ce projet est déjà en partie financé mais nous envisageons de finaliser d'autres produits pour que la gamme soit réellement complète. Nos ambitions sont en réalité plus élevées, car nous voulons offrir une gamme complète d'objets alors nous comptons réellement sur nos ""backers"" !VOUS SEREZ RECOMPENSES EN RETOURLes prix de lancement sont très agressifs lors de la campagne de crowdfunding, parce que nous voulons avant tout démontrer la qualité de nos produits et le sérieux de leur conception. Nous avons tout pour assurer la livraison des premières commandes même si nous n'atteignons pas l'objectif, mais nous comptons sur vous pour faire mieux que çà !Rappelez vous, toute contribution même minimale est importante pour nous :
Supportez nous en achetant un T-Shirt, et portez les couleurs de SensyBEE ! Nous cherchons une audience maximale auprès des supporters qui adhèrent à notre projet ! Cela nous motive bien au delà de l'aspect financier.
Démarrez avec le «Starter» kit, et vous nous donnez déjà l'opportunité de produire le dispositif majeur de notre concept : le module «BEE-Control », tout en rejoignant la liste de contributeurs actifs pour un monde plus écologique !
A vous, famille, amis et relations professionnelles avec qui nous partageons passionnément ce projet depuis des mois, vos soutiens et encouragements sont précieux, continuez !Votre contribution en devenant un utilisateur de SensyBEE à l'occasion de ce lancement attestera de votre confiance.

<h3><b>The Cooper Lumen Design Challenge: Creating a Working Prototype for a Solar-Powered Public WiFi Hotspot &amp; Charging Station</b></h3>
<p>The Cooper Lumen Design Challenge is an
innovative, cross-disciplinary design challenge for students at Cooper Union,
aimed at creating a working prototype for a solar-powered public WiFi hotspot.</p>
<p>Unlike other solar powered products, the
“Cooper Lumen”  will uniquely combine the
functions of providing public wireless internet, emergency lighting, and a charging station for computers and mobile devices.</p>
<p>The semester-long design initiative will
commence in January 2014, and will
include students from the Cooper Union schools of Art, Architecture, and
Engineering.</p>
<h3><b>Engaging Innovative Student Design to Enhance Community Resiliency in
Post-Sandy NYC</b></h3>
<p>
The resulting design(s) will become candidates for deployment in the WiFi-NY
People’s Emergency Network, which will place these units along Manhattan’s East
River Waterfront and in common areas in and around the Two Bridges, Lower East
Side, Chinatown, East Village and other New York City neighborhoods.</p>
<p>These neighborhoods -- much of which are
made up of high-rise affordable housing developments -- were particularly
impacted by Superstorm Sandy’s storm surge, leaving thousands of vulnerable
families and elders trapped without power, communications, transportation, or
supplies.  For many buildings, it took
weeks to restore power and communications.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the Cooper Lumen
Design Challenge is to help residential corridors impacted by Superstorm Sandy
come back even stronger by encouraging the development and implementation of
durable and reliable devices that will anchor these neighborhoods for years to
come.</p>
<h3><b>Support the Cooper Lumen Design Challenge</b></h3>
<p>We hope that you will join us in supporting
this momentous endeavor. Please
check out the various ways you can support and give at any level you can.</p>
<p>All proceeds
raised will go towards covering the costs of materials and physical
hardware the students will need in order to conduct their work, including solar
cells, batteries, charge controllers,
LED lights, wireless equipment, and structural elements.</p>

<h1>Why the bFan® works</h1>
<p>The bFan®’s innovative design removes the heat that is generated by your body and gets trapped inside your bed (your sheets, comforter, and mattress). This unique system enables you to sleep much cooler and deeper at night and save you money on air conditioning costs.</p>
<p>By utilizing convection, one of the primary cooling methods of our body, we are able to sleep cooler without having to lower our thermostat to a financially challenging level.</p>

<h1>Health benefits</h1>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.bedfan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bFan</a>® will help you sleep cooler at night and will help people who are hot sleepers regardless of reason, as well as help people with heath related sleep issues like <a href=""http://www.bedfan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">night sweats</a>. But did you know that it can also make you healthier?</p>
<p>Several studies have shown the benefits of sleeping cooler. These studies show that sleeping cooler can help with:</p>
<p>Weight loss, lowering the risk of metabolic diseases, deeper sleep for better body restoration, reduction of insomnia, aids in the promotion of anti-aging hormones and helps combat cancer.</p>
<p>Research conducted by the University of South Australia suggests that sleeping cooler will result in a better night's sleep, and help cure insomnia. This is because the body's core temperature actually needs to drop in order to initiate sleep. So, if you're having trouble falling and staying asleep, the bFan® could be your savior. ( <a href=""http://w3.unisa.edu.au/unisanews/2004/June/insomnia.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://w3.unisa.edu.au/unisanews/2004/June/inso...</a> )</p>
<p>The bFan® can help produce Melatonin by lowering your core body temperature. Releasing needed melatonin not only tells your body it's time to sleep, it's a hormone that also promotes anti-aging. The cooling effect of the bFan® actually helps your body produce melatonin when you allow it to cool you sufficiently.</p>
<p>Melatonin regulates our cycles, mood,reproduction, weight and may help combat Cancer (web <a href=""http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/10/10/melatonin.aspx#_edn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/arch...</a>).</p>
<p>The bFan® can help decrease your risk of metabolic illnesses. Studies have shown that sleeping in a cooler bed helps you burn calories while awake. It also helps increase ""brown"" or good fat in the body, which lowers the risk of metabolic diseases like diabetes.</p>
<p>The bFan® will help you get a better night’s sleep. During the night, if your bed is too hot (or alternately too cold), your body will work to regulate your temperature. Doctors have stated for years that a cooler bed is linked to deeper sleep, whereas a hot bed increases wakefulness and decreases slow wave sleep.These are just a few reasons the bFan® is a healthy product (web <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954193"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954193</a>).</p>

<h1>Moving Forward   </h1>
<p>Over the last 10 years with have talked with many of our customers and listened to their ideas on what they would like to see in the next version of the Bedfan. We took those ideas and have implemented many of them into this <b>new version</b> that we call the <b>bFan®</b>.</p>
<p>These are the things that we have <b>improved</b> on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Increased the stability</b> with a balanced footing and lower center of gravity</li>
<li>Increased the overall <b>air flow</b>
</li>
<li>Increased the fans total <b>static pressure</b>
</li>
<li>Made the fan <b>much quieter</b> and much stronger</li>
</ul>
<p>The following video will show some of the <b>improvements</b> and how we have accomplished them.</p>

<h1>Setting Up Your bFan®   </h1>
<p>The installation of the bFan® is <b>very simple</b>. In this next video we will show you just how simple it is.. For this installation we installed the bFan® at the foot of the bed, which is the preferred location. From the foot of the bed the air will naturally travel along your body and exit at the top of the bed around your shoulders.</p>
<p>The bFan® is intended to deliver the air between the top and bottom sheets of your bed so that it is in direct contact with your body.  </p>
<p>One of the nice improvements to this new unit is that the base is <b>extremely sturdy</b> with a wide and deep footing as well as a lower center of gravity. This allows the user to place the fan anywhere they like and not worry about stability.<b>See the following full video for installation instructions. </b></p>

<h1>Controlling the bFan   </h1>
<p>The bFan® is fully controllable from off to high and all points in between. When you first start using the bFan® you should start with the bFan® on low and gradually work your way up. At the same time you will raise the temperature in your room by a couple degrees each night. The objective is to bring the fan to about half of full power yet still feel cool. After a few nights of doing this you will reach a point of comfort that you have never felt before. This is equilibrium and from this point you can stop changing the thermostat and start sleeping deeper and sounder.</p>
<p>For the first night, set the fan on low and see if it is too cool in bed for you. If your bed is too cool, you need to raise the temperature in your room for the next night. Follow this pattern until you have reached about half power on the fan and you are no longer too cool.</p>
<p>The point of equilibrium is the point at which the bFan® is evacuating your body heat at about the same rate that it is being created. Above equilibrium will be too cool and below equilibrium will be too warm.</p>
<p>By adjusting the thermostat in your house a few degrees at a time, along with adjusting the bFan® speed, you will eventually find that you are significantly reducing the amount of electricity being consumed thus lowering your electric bill at the same time.</p>

 What is the bFan®?
The body will extend from 19” tall to 37” tall. The air duct is 12” wide and ¾” deep. The base is 6.25” tall X 7” deep and 12” wide. The base can be set in any direction, either under the bed or pointing outward from the bed. It can be place anywhere around the bed from the foot to the top and anywhere along the side of the bed.

The bFan® is for people who want to save money on their air conditioning bill and not go broke trying to sleep cooler.
The bFan® is for people who are hot sleepers and really want to sleep cooler or have cooler sheets at night.
The bFan® is for women who suffer from the effects of menopause including night sweats derived from hot flashes.
The bFan® is for people who have a medical condition that causes their body to get hot at night and want to sleep cooler.
For people wanting to take advantage of the huge health benefits obtained from sleeping cooler.


The bottom line is that almost everyone will benefit from the bFan®. Whether you are a hot sleeper just trying to get a good night’s sleep or looking to gain maximum health benefits as well as lowering your electric bill, the bFan® is for you. Many people have been able to lower their electric bill by as much as 50%
The bFan® is available with more information on our web site
www.bfan.world 


Why the bFan® works
The bFan®’s innovative design removes the heat that is generated by your body and gets trapped inside your bed (your sheets, comforter, and mattress). This unique system enables you to sleep much cooler and deeper at night and save you money on air conditioning costs.
By utilizing convection, one of the primary cooling methods of our body, we are able to sleep cooler without having to lower our thermostat to a financially challenging level.

Health benefits
The bFan® will help you sleep cooler at night and will help people who are hot sleepers regardless of reason, as well as help people with heath related sleep issues like night sweats. But did you know that it can also make you healthier?
Several studies have shown the benefits of sleeping cooler. These studies show that sleeping cooler can help with:
Weight loss, lowering the risk of metabolic diseases, deeper sleep for better body restoration, reduction of insomnia, aids in the promotion of anti-aging hormones and helps combat cancer.
Research conducted by the University of South Australia suggests that sleeping cooler will result in a better night's sleep, and help cure insomnia. This is because the body's core temperature actually needs to drop in order to initiate sleep. So, if you're having trouble falling and staying asleep, the bFan® could be your savior.

Sit on the toilet as you normally do. Pull out the FUSION to a comfortable position. Adjust the toe-piece height if and as needed, and then gently load your feet and lean forward a bit. After the use store it back under the toilet bowel. Easy enough? Why get a FUSION FUSION's patent pending design offers unique functionality and experience, for everyone. Listed below are some key points.#1. Squatting is better, FUSION makes it easierIt's no rocket science. Sitting creates a natural kink in the colon, to maintain continence. Squatting posture straightens the colon for a clean release. This is just how we are designed. Really.Sit vs. squat; science behind squatting Thus, sitting on the toilet is no good for constipation, hemorrhoids, pelvic floor dysfunction, urinary infections, and many other colon diseases. A simple switch to squatting can have a big impact, and FUSION makes it easier than ever. Remember the old saying, prevention is better than cure … in this case funner too!  #2. FUSION is height adjustable, with easeNo tools required, no cumbersome mechanisms, no need of having different footstools for different-height family members, and no need to compromise on the squat!Easily-adjustable height; un-compromising squat You can easily adjust the toe-platform height to suit your height, experience, and taste! Thus, whether you are a beginner who never squatted before, or a pro-squatter, FUSION will serve you well.  #3. FUSION = many in oneFUSION is like four different-height footstools + a massager, all combined in one elegant design, for the price and convenience of just one!4 different levels + a massager At the lowest level it works like the original TURBO Stool™, at the highest level it works like a flat-top stool, and then you can adjust the height to everything in between!      #4.

<p>We’ve all experienced Wi-Fi problems whether it’s a slow connection, reboots, constant buffering or you just can’t connect in some rooms of your house. It’s really annoying, especially as our homes become smarter with voice assistants and connected thermostats, and our demand on bandwidth increases with streaming services and online gaming.</p>
<p>Our current Wi-Fi systems aren’t able to keep up with the demands of a connected home and today we're saying ""enough is enough""! The M2 Hive gives you the speed, connectivity, simplicity, and control that your home Wi-Fi needs and deserves. Finally, say goodbye to bad Wi-Fi. Hello to the M2 Hive.</p>

Reaching these goals will allow us to upgrade our incredible system even further! What are the new features? We’ll be able to build a VPN straight into the system, with super advanced encryption and privacy algorithms, leveraging the same solution used by the NSA! Think passwords are a pain? No worries, your guests will be able to log into your network directly if you are Facebook friends - it’s so much easier!

A Wi-Fi system that has your whole house covered

We’ve all experienced Wi-Fi problems whether it’s a slow connection, reboots, constant buffering or you just can’t connect in some rooms of your house. It’s really annoying, especially as our homes become smarter with voice assistants and connected thermostats, and our demand on bandwidth increases with streaming services and online gaming.
Our current Wi-Fi systems aren’t able to keep up with the demands of a connected home and today we're saying ""enough is enough""! The M2 Hive gives you the speed, connectivity, simplicity, and control that your home Wi-Fi needs and deserves. Finally, say goodbye to bad Wi-Fi. Hello to the M2 Hive.

When we say fast Wi-Fi, we mean it. M2 Hive is twice as fast as the industry average. No more waiting for your favorite program to load or dealing with lag in your gaming.    Key featuresStretch goals - upgrades to the system!We’ve decided that with the extra funding we can give everyone even more great features for the M2 - so we’ve set some stretch goals. Reaching these goals will allow us to upgrade our incredible system even further! What are the new features? We’ll be able to build a VPN straight into the system, with super advanced encryption and privacy algorithms, leveraging the same solution used by the NSA! Think passwords are a pain? No worries, your guests will be able to log into your network directly if you are Facebook friends - it’s so much easier! We have many, many upgrades planned and reaching these stretch goals will help us deliver these upgrades to you by September! The power is in your handsNot only does the M2 Hive provide your home with Wi-Fi connectivity like never before, it also grants you greater control on how many people are using the Wi-Fi and how much bandwidth devices are using so your network runs as you want it to. That means when you say Bedtime, you can mean it. Also, limiting speed means that your kids can access Google, but not Netflix; great for when they should be studying. And as for your new neighbors who have been hogging your bandwidth since they moved in, they will no longer be a problem. Press is talking about Mercku""...The M2 Wi-Fi router and M2 Hive Wi-Fi system are aimed at giving those devices the speed, control, and range they need across the whole home..."" - VentureBeat Testimonials Break through walls with our Wi-Fi nodesDon’t worry we’re not inviting the Hulk to smash down your walls, there’s a lot simpler way of getting Wi-Fi in every room in your house. Our Bee nodes are small devices that you can plug into any socket. They give you a range of up to 5,000 square feet and travel through walls which means you’ll have a stable connection wherever you are. Stay connectedWe all know what it’s like when you’re in one room asking Alexa to play your favorite album, but it drops out because one of your family starts streaming a film on Netflix. No more will you have to fight over who is slowing the Wi-Fi down.  You can connect dozens of devices in your house and supports multiple 8K streaming.Awards and RecognitionWe usually hide our Wi-Fi systems away because they are bulky and ugly. We wanted to create a product that would be happy to show in your home. We’re very pleased to say that the industry agrees with us! We’re also proud of our team for winning numerous software and hardware awards over the years. Perks available Referral programWe are running a referral program. Every $250 you refer generates 1 credit, which can be redeemed for free prizes, all with free shipping! Here’s how it works:Use your credits to redeem prizes at the end of the campaign.

M2 Hive is compatible with most socket variations and we will be shipping to most countries. Behind the scenes TimelineHow we got hereIt all started fourteen years ago when Mercku co-founders created the modern cell phone antenna, the very same antennae that will likely be on the phone you’re using today.As world experts in telecommunications, we were always looking for ways to better personal communications and connectivity. Mercku was founded in 2017, because we were frustrated with the bad internet connection and slow Wi-Fi speeds that plagued homes across the world, especially with the number of devices under our roofs multiplying. We believe everyone should be able to enjoy the tech in their homes smoothly and without interruption.Mercku's products are manufactured in a world-class facility in Shenzhen, a facility which also manufactures other Wi-Fi products, with over a decade of experience in the field. We chose this facility because it had experience with high-quality goods, and also has the capacity to produce up to a million units a month - fulfilling our needs. We started with M1 which was our first generation router. We sold 5 million units to one of the largest telecom companies in Asia, acting as their sole Wi-Fi provider.However, we wanted to bring great connectivity to everyone which is why we’re here with M2 Hive. We have been working on M2's core technology for the past two years to bring everyone better Wi-Fi speeds and coverage. Technical Specifications

<p>The Fendrihan Stainless Steel Adjustable Shaving Brush and Razor Stand emerged from a simple request, but one we've received over and over again; <strong>a stand for all brushes</strong>.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>“Quake Escape”</strong> is a Brand new Product designed to provide two very important things, first to Confirm that a significant Earthquake has occurred and to Provide Emergency LED Lighting to help see your way to safety in the event of Darkness. In an earthquake this product could help to save lives and could help to prevent injuries. </p>
<p>This Design is a high tech device that intelligently detects seismic motion and then through sophisticated software called <em>“Intellisense Technology”;</em> it allows us to determine if there is an Earthquake or just a vibration from say a door slam. After Two long years we have completed the design, characterization and CE and FCC Certifications as well as the retail packaging with instructions in four languages (English, Spanish, Italian and Japanese).</p>
<p>“Quake Escape” is battery operated and can provide 24 to 48 hours of continuous light to help see your way to safety. “Quake Escape” is also now Patent Pending. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Today we are looking to “Indiegogo.com” for funding to launch a major Marketing and Advertisement campaign. We need to educate the public and get the word out to people that this product is now available and should be included as part of their disaster preparedness readiness.We have had fantastic and positive responses from businesses, organizations and people world wide.</p>
<p>Here is one quote from a Captain of the Santa Clara Fire Department;</p>
<p><em>5 out of 5 Stars.  ""</em><em>This could saveyour life!"" October 22, 2012, By Brent Rapport</em></p>
<p><em>I purchased four of these, one for each bedroom and the hallway. I want to know that in an earthquake that I can see through the debris to get to my children.

<p>We also have a real testimony of “Quake Escape”actually working in a 6.0 Magnitude Quake in Mexico at 3:23am on Nov. 15, 2012 which was videotaped.</p>
<p>We have been on radio, TV News, Internet shows and the DIY Network. Units have shipped within the USA, Peru, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Japan. We are looking for major retail stores to sell our product and are targeting a MSRP Price of $49.95</p>

$20 Doorbell Camera + Indoor Chime

Ships early July (with Chime)
With Doorbell Camera, you’ll be notified when there’s motion, a ring, or both. No more squinting through the peephole.

How Did We Make a $20 Doorbell Camera?First, we started by obsessing over what are the essential security and notification features that you need (and what's extraneous). We took out full video and added a boomerang-style GIF showing who is at your door. Then we made the notification super fast with an indoor chime that rings in case your phone is off.

We've built a number of other amazing home security products. We've put tons of TLC into them and we hope you'll use them too after you fall in love with our Doorbell Camera.
Porch Protection Plan (PPP)We partnered with an A- rated insurance carrier to bring you package theft protection. It's part of our Porch Protection Plan (PPP) where your packages are covered for up to $300 ($150 per claim). You can easily file a claim right from the app!  Also includes 365 days of cloud storage.
That's It!

<h3>Meet BarkBath™ - the next generation of dog bathing</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488224512/xxv9cdyuvyu1ev5bcyay.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Faster, Easier, Less Messy way to bathe your dog.</strong></p>
<p>For many households, bathing the family dog is one more chore that takes up valuable time, uses several towels and takes plenty of patience. Between the splatter that comes with a good post-bath shake, to the water splashed around the tub, washing Fido can often create an even bigger mess than the dirt that prompted the bath in the first place. To make bath time less of a chore, BISSELL is introducing the BarkBath™, the first portable bath system—the next generation of dog bathing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Key Highlights of the BarkBath System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Portable so you can bathe your dog in any room of the house with virtually no mess</li>
<li>Cleans from the skin up with specially designed nozzles that get beneath the fur</li>
<li>Cleans an 80lb+ dog with up to 50 times less water versus traditional bathing in a tub<ul>
<li>BarkBath uses 48oz of water to wash an 80 lbs dog</li>
<li>Bath tub method can take up to 19 gallons of water to wash an 80 lbs dog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dirty water is captured in a separate tank for a clean you can see</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The BarkBath™ Portable Dog Bath System is the newest Pet Inspired innovation from BISSELL. The BarkBath is the company’s first portable bath system that allows you to bathe your dog with virtually no mess – eliminating the inevitable clean-up that comes along with washing a four-legged family member.</p>
<p>“BISSELL is always on the hunt to create the next product that helps with being a pet parent. If we can make pet clean up easy, more pets will be adopted!” said Chuck Martin, General Manager of Innovation. “Bath time can be a huge pain point for both the pet and the pet parent. BarkBath helps make pet bath time faster, easier, and less messy than ever before.”</p>
<p>More than two years and plenty of paws-on research went into the development of the BarkBath system. Working with real pet parents (including product developers who are pet parents themselves), BISSELL set out to create a product that makes dog bath time easier. Because the product is so new to the marketplace, online resources have been created to guide pet parents through BarkBath best practices.</p>
<p>We're excited to launch on Indiegogo because we want this community of early adopters to be the first to get their hands / paws on BarkBath.  We value your feedback above all else.</p>

The Faster, Easier, Less Messy way to bathe your dog.
For many households, bathing the family dog is one more chore that takes up valuable time, uses several towels and takes plenty of patience. Between the splatter that comes with a good post-bath shake, to the water splashed around the tub, washing Fido can often create an even bigger mess than the dirt that prompted the bath in the first place. To make bath time less of a chore, BISSELL is introducing the BarkBath™, the first portable bath system—the next generation of dog bathing.
 
Key Highlights of the BarkBath System

Portable so you can bathe your dog in any room of the house with virtually no mess
Cleans from the skin up with specially designed nozzles that get beneath the fur
Cleans an 80lb+ dog with up to 50 times less water versus traditional bathing in a tub
BarkBath uses 48oz of water to wash an 80 lbs dog
Bath tub method can take up to 19 gallons of water to wash an 80 lbs dog


Dirty water is captured in a separate tank for a clean you can see
Note – Sound/noise emitted is similar to a vacuum.  For best results, your dog should not be afraid of the sound of a vacuum.

 If you want to cool your room faster and more effectively, you can easily add ice to a dedicated ice compartment.In the winter, add water and set it to low and it becomes an effective humidifier for treating seasonal dry skin and allergies.In Quiet mode, Quilo™ can even operate at a whisper-quiet sound level while lowering the local room area temperature by up to 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit *.So how energy efficient is Quilo™ you ask? Well, how much electricity does it take to power one light bulb? There you go!The Quilo ™ does not have a compressor or refrigerant gas, and does not release any harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. Quilo™ was made to move. Constructed with durable wheels, super-light body (13.2 Lbs) Quilo™ can be rolled from room to room, house to house with ease.Detachable Power Cord/ Universal Voltage Compatibility Quilo™ goes where you go. It was built to be used internationally so you never have to worry about compatibility. A low-energy LED light creates a soothing, comfortable glow during the night, while also making the water level in the tank visible for easy maintenance. A minimalistic yet full-function remote control allows you to operate the Quilo™ from across the room.  The Active Carbon Filter helps filter out dust particles and odour-causing pollutants from the air, helping to improve air quality in your room.Our challenge was to create a cooling device that was as energy-efficient, eco-friendly and quiet as possible without compromising on cooling effectiveness.Inspired by portable battery powered devices such as laptops, our engineers developed their ground-breaking, patent-pending brushless DC motor technology that minimizes energy consumption while maximizing airflow. We worked with an award winning German design agency to design the Quilo™.  We asked the design agency to reflect the essence of the product - its size, low noise levels and performance in a design that enhances your space.The internal construction from the grooves in the walls to the curve of the fan blades, was carefully engineered to maximize airflow travelling throughout the system.Our Project Manager, Nishant, explaining how Quilo™ works  Our team has been working passionately on the Quilo™ for over two and a half years and we are so excited to finally show it to you.Some photos from the first production run Our mission is to design and manufacture holistic and sustainable products for your home.  We are passionate about creating climate friendly products that balance high performance with energy efficiency. The air quality in our homes is fundamental to our family’s health. This drives us to create innovative climate control products to enhance and protect the air in our homes.We need our backers help to start mass production of the Quilo™. The first small batch of Quilo’s are already under production, so early backers can get their Quilo's delivered within 2 to 4 weeks of the campaign end date. It is the second batch that we need help with.  As we head towards mass production, we need your support to place a 2nd bulk order for our breakthrough new product. Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help us by sharing our campaign with all your friends and family. Go ahead and post the campaign URL on Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. We appreciate all the help we can get.We feel so grateful to everyone who has taken the time to read our campaign and for those who contributed what they could to make a difference and are helping us spread the word. We have spent the last few months working hard to bring our vision to life in this campaign and it was worth every minute thanks to all our generous supporters. Please know your efforts, even the smallest, don’t go unnoticed.

<br/>FAQ's</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/><strong>1.   What is the device's range? Same as my router? What if I have a big mansion with devices on three floors?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Fingbox connects directly to your home router, so its range will match that of your router. There is no limit to the number of devices which can be monitored, which means that even if you have a big house and a lot of devices Fingbox will work with all of them.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>2. Is there a subscription for service?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No! The one-off purchase of the box is all you need to use Fingbox.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>3. If someone else comes to my home with their tablet, laptop or phone and connects to my Internet, will Fingbox notify me?</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You will also be able to get alerts when family or guests join your network too.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>4. If a device I don’t recognize joins my network, what will Fingbox do?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Fingbox will alert you when an unrecognized device is trying to access your network and give a wealth of information to help you identify it. Then you can choose to block or allow the device.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>5. Is there a limit to how many devices my Fingbox can work with?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">There is no limit to the number of devices Fingbox can work with on a network. As many as your network can handle!</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>8. How much do you charge for shipping? Why are shipping costs to Europe so high?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Shipping to the US is now free. Shipping to EU is $25, which includes VAT, customs, and duty charges. Shipping to the rest of the world is now $15.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For our customers in Europe, the $25 charge is about $12 for VAT, customs and import duty into the EU and the rest for sending the box from Taiwan, where it is produced, to a facility in Europe to clear customs and then onward to you.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>9. Does Fingbox work with an all-in-one Internet provider box having Modem/Switch/ Router/Wi-Fi built in?</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To make Fingbox the best product it can be, we have identified the challenges we may face with this project:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1)  We need to ensure a smooth integration of the premium Fingbox features with the existing Fing application. This is certainly a challenge, but with the success of the Fing app it is one that we have collective experience to overcome. To ensure a smooth integration, we will ensure that we provide many Fing user’s access the app beforehand to provide feedback.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2) We rely on 3rd party suppliers to build and deliver the Fingbox hardware which is home to our proprietary Fingbox software. The software is ready and the hardware prototype is ready. Though with 3rd party contractors there is always risk of unforeseen obstacles. Given the experience our team has in delivering previous hardware, we are well equipped to handle challenges that we may face. We have both the technical expertise and previous experience to execute on this project.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>20. Does Fingbox have it’s own app?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Fingbox is a hardware extension to Fing. Fingbox functionalities will be part of the Fing app.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>21. Who is this product intended for?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Home users of all ages, households streaming video and audio, Family with children, and anybody with a home network!</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Fingbox is currently only available in the Fing blue, however, the device can also be displayed without the exterior blue piece using only the white inner. Therefore you do have the choice to display Fingbox in your home in either blue or white. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>23. Can I dim down or stop the Fingbox LED lights?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes, you'll be able to choose the brightness of the Fingbox LED lights and you can also disable them if you wish. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>24. Are Fingbox LED lights emotive?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes, Fingbox LED lights will react and communicate what is happening with the box.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>25. Does Fingbox support multiple VLANs and subnets?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No. A Fingbox device is needed for each VLAN or subnet.</p>

<br/>FAQ's</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/><strong>1.¿Cuál es el rango del dispositivo? ¿El mismo que mi router? ¿Qué pasa si tengo una gran mansión con dispositivos en tres plantas? </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Fingbox se conecta directamente al router de tu hogar, así que el rango será el mismo que el de tu router.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>2. ¿Existe alguna suscripción para el servicio? </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">¡No! Lo único que necesitas para usar Fingbox es comprar el dispositivo.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sí, exactamente eso es lo que hará. Fingbox siempre te notificará cuando un nuevo dispositivo esté intentando conectarse a tu red y te dará la posibilidad ya sea de bloquear o aceptar que el dispositivo acceda a tu red.  </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>4. Si un dispositivo que no reconozco se une a mi red, ¿Qué hará Fingbox?</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>5. ¿Hay algún límite del número de dispositivos con el que Fingbox va a poder trabajar?</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>6. ¿ Cuándo es el cierre de campaña de Indiegogo ?</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>7. Sí vivo fuera de los Estados Unidos, ¿Puedo comprar Fingbox y obtener todos sus beneficios? </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">¡Sí! ¡Absolutamente! Fingbox se envía a todo el mundo. Clientes de EU están sujetos a VAT, mismo que ya está incluido en el precio final.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>8. ¿Cuánto cobran por envío? ¿Por qué los gastos de envío a Europa son tan altos? </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El envío a los Estados Unidos es de $10 USD. Envíos a EU son de $25 USD, mismos que incluyen el IVA y los impuestos de importación. Envíos al resto del mundo son de $20 USD. No hay cargos adicionales.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Para nuestros clientes en Europa, el cargo es de $25 USD, de los cuales $12 USD corresponden al IVA y cargos de importación a la Unión Europea; el resto cubre el envío de la caja desde Taiwan donde es producida, llevada a una bodega en Europa para de ahí liberar aduanas y enviártela a ti. Una disculpa si esto no es lo suficientemente claro, pero Indiegogo no permite añadir la opción de añadir el IVA; de hecho muchas compañías tienden a dejar los tramites de importación en manos del consumidor final incluidos los cargos que éstos lleven. Estamos intentando facilitar el proceso para ti.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Para poder hacer que Fingbox sea el mejor producto, hemos identificado los desafíos que podríamos llegar a enfrentar:<br/><br/>1) Tenemos que garantizar una integración fácil de las características premium con la aplicación existente de Fing.

¡Sí! ¡Absolutamente! Fingbox se envía a todo el mundo. Clientes de EU están sujetos a VAT, mismo que ya está incluido en el precio final.

El envío a los Estados Unidos es de $10 USD. Envíos a EU son de $25 USD, mismos que incluyen el IVA y los impuestos de importación. Envíos al resto del mundo son de $20 USD. No hay cargos adicionales.
Para nuestros clientes en Europa, el cargo es de $25 USD, de los cuales $12 USD corresponden al IVA y cargos de importación a la Unión Europea; el resto cubre el envío de la caja desde Taiwan donde es producida, llevada a una bodega en Europa para de ahí liberar aduanas y enviártela a ti.

Der die restlichen $13 kommen von dem versand von Taiwan, wo das Produkt hergestellt wird.

Quels sont les risques et les contraintes de notre projet? Pour que Fingbox soit exploitée à son maximum, on a identifié les contraintes à surmonter dans ce projet. Il faut assurer une intégration parfaite des fonctions de la fingbox avec l’application Fing. Ceci est certainement une contrainte mais avec le succès de l’application Fing, elle est surmontable grâce l’expérience collective de l’équipe. Pour réussir cette intégration, nous testerons le résultat en donnant à beaucoup d’utilisateurs Fing l’accès à Fingbox pour voir quells réactions et suggestion ils nous donnent en retour. Nous comptons sur les fournisseurs tiers pour construire tout le matériel nécéssaire pour la Fingbox mais aussi de délivrez ces Fingbox. Le logiciel est prêt ainsi que le prototype de la boite. Cependant avec ses fournisseurs tiers il y a toujours un risque de problèmes. Cependant avec l’experience de notre équipe nous sommes bien expérimentés pour surmonter les problèmes qu’on pourrait rencontrer. Avec nos experts techniques et notre expérience on peut éxécuter ce projet.

<h1>A System That Can Change the World!</h1></span></span></span></span><p> </p>
<p>The symbiotic relationship that makes this beautifully designed Tabletop Aquaponics System work can change the world - really!<span> I was amazed when I first learned it was possible to mimic nature in a sustainable way with plants and fish. This growing method is powerful and can be expanded from a small system to one large enough to feed a village! </span></p>
<p><span></span>One of the most exciting things I discovered about this growing technique is that it actually has the potential to end world hunger! Even in desolate places, urban areas where space is limited, or just about anywhere. This type of growing is called aquaponics and it uses 90% less water than soil based gardening.  It’s completely organic, uses no chemicals and food grows faster and in less space!
</p>
<p><b>How
We Got Started</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/146488/files/20131021161444-Lettuce-roots.JPG?1382397284"" src="""" style=""padding: 10px; width: 168px; height: 126px; float: right;""/></p>
<p>In 2009 my father and I started experimenting with different techniques and ideas using the aquaponics theory. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012 when I decided to design backyard <a href=""http://shop.endlessfoodsystems.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aquaponics systems</a> that were pleasing to look at, could be mass produced, modular in design and could be shipped via freight. </p>
<p>I thought it would be a piece of cake since I have developed products before, but that was not the case! However, perseverance paid off and today we have an aquaponics kit that is easy to setup and manage!  We began shipping in February of 2013 and are very happy with the design.</p>
<p><b>Build
It &amp; They Will Come...</b> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/147148/files/20131022010712-aquaponics-before-after.jpg?1382429232"" src="""" style=""padding: 10px; width: 276.5px; height: 183px; float: left;""/></p>
<p>We’ve received a lot of praise from people around the world who are already familiar with aquaponics. We also talk to people all the time that have never heard of the concept and are amazed once they learn how it works! That is great news!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While aquaponics is not new, it is generally known or understood by a lot of the general public. Most people around the world have no idea what aquaponics is or what it can do. If more people really understood the power and potential of aquaponics, amazing things could happen. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/146514/files/20131021163005-AA-logo-for-site-header.jpg?1382398205"" src="""" style=""padding: 10px; width: 102px; height: 102px; float: right;""/>Attention is starting to build and gain momentum, especially with the help of organizations such as The Aquaponics Association (which we are a proud member of). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/147158/files/20131022011505-photo-1sm.jpg?1382429705"" src="""" style=""padding: 10px; width: 159.88px; height: 212px; float: left;""/></p>
<p>With your help in funding this campaign and by sharing this with your family, friends and on Social Media such as Facebook, you can help spread the word about aquaponics! Once people experience how easy it is to grow plants with our new tabletop aquaponics system, the <b><i>seed </i></b>will be planted! </p>
<p>This new system is affordable &amp; compact.<span>  It’s an attractive and practical way to show people just how simple an aquaponics system is.  Not only does it grow clean, non-GMO, chemical free food, but it does it in a small space with elegance.  The flowing fountain, soothing sound of water, and interaction with fish also make it a fun addition for the whole family!</span></p>
<p><b>Seeking $20,000...</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/146526/files/20131021164622-Endless-Food-Systems-250x97.jpg?1382399182"" src="""" style=""padding: 10px; width: 180.83px; height: 70px; float: right;""/></p>
<p>We are raising capital for tooling &amp; production costs. While we have already invested a significant amount of money and time into our full size Endless Food System kits and our sales are increasing, we need your help to jump start getting the word out for this compact tabletop system!</p>
<p>By being among the first to own a tabletop aquaponic system, you can join in the aquaponics revolution! Become a part of this incredible movement of food independence and health!<span>  We believe if the knowledge of this growing technique could reach around the world, the majority of health issues would disappear.  It is interesting to note that the largest percentage of our full size kit sales so far have been to Doctors, Chiropractors and cancer survivors. </span></p>
<p><span><br/>It is no secret that eating chemical free, un-adulterated food is a major key to our bodies health.  Use this opportunity to get a great discount on this amazing new system! Be on the ground floor with us for this product launch and spread the word!</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Making a
Difference</b></p>
<p>Be a part of the health solution and spread the word about aquaponics!<span>  Image if you told someone about aquaponics and later learned they had a system large enough to help feed their entire family perpetually with healthy organic non-GMO foods! And that their food bill went down while their food security went up! What if someone you shared this information with started growing aquaponically and their health issues disappeared?  Or if someone went on a mission trip to a poor area and taught a community how to build and manage a large system fed their whole community?</span></p>
<p>By joining us in this movement today, not only will you receive a great product at a<br/>reduced price, but you will also be helping to spread this powerful information! You don’t necessarily have to do great things with this knowledge yourself but what if someone you told or someone they told made a major difference in other people’s lives! Or maybe someone just visits your house and asks a question about that interesting thing with fish and plants sitting on your counter and they do something powerful with it!</p>
<p>While our small tabletop system is great to look at and
grow some herbs, it is the knowledge of aquaponics and sharing that knowledge
with others that can have a profound effect!</p>

A System That Can Change the World! 
The symbiotic relationship that makes this beautifully designed Tabletop Aquaponics System work can change the world - really! I was amazed when I first learned it was possible to mimic nature in a sustainable way with plants and fish. This growing method is powerful and can be expanded from a small system to one large enough to feed a village! 
One of the most exciting things I discovered about this growing technique is that it actually has the potential to end world hunger! Even in desolate places, urban areas where space is limited, or just about anywhere. This type of growing is called aquaponics and it uses 90% less water than soil based gardening.  It’s completely organic, uses no chemicals and food grows faster and in less space!

How
We Got Started

In 2009 my father and I started experimenting with different techniques and ideas using the aquaponics theory. 
Fast forward to 2012 when I decided to design backyard aquaponics systems that were pleasing to look at, could be mass produced, modular in design and could be shipped via freight. 
I thought it would be a piece of cake since I have developed products before, but that was not the case! However, perseverance paid off and today we have an aquaponics kit that is easy to setup and manage!  We began shipping in February of 2013 and are very happy with the design.
Build
It & They Will Come... 

We’ve received a lot of praise from people around the world who are already familiar with aquaponics. We also talk to people all the time that have never heard of the concept and are amazed once they learn how it works! That is great news!


While aquaponics is not new, it is generally known or understood by a lot of the general public. Most people around the world have no idea what aquaponics is or what it can do. If more people really understood the power and potential of aquaponics, amazing things could happen. 
Attention is starting to build and gain momentum, especially with the help of organizations such as The Aquaponics Association (which we are a proud member of). 
 

With your help in funding this campaign and by sharing this with your family, friends and on Social Media such as Facebook, you can help spread the word about aquaponics! Once people experience how easy it is to grow plants with our new tabletop aquaponics system, the seed will be planted! 
This new system is affordable & compact.  It’s an attractive and practical way to show people just how simple an aquaponics system is.  Not only does it grow clean, non-GMO, chemical free food, but it does it in a small space with elegance.  The flowing fountain, soothing sound of water, and interaction with fish also make it a fun addition for the whole family!
Seeking $20,000...

We are raising capital for tooling & production costs. While we have already invested a significant amount of money and time into our full size Endless Food System kits and our sales are increasing, we need your help to jump start getting the word out for this compact tabletop system!
By being among the first to own a tabletop aquaponic system, you can join in the aquaponics revolution! Become a part of this incredible movement of food independence and health!  We believe if the knowledge of this growing technique could reach around the world, the majority of health issues would disappear.  It is interesting to note that the largest percentage of our full size kit sales so far have been to Doctors, Chiropractors and cancer survivors. 
It is no secret that eating chemical free, un-adulterated food is a major key to our bodies health.  Use this opportunity to get a great discount on this amazing new system! Be on the ground floor with us for this product launch and spread the word!


Making a
Difference
Be a part of the health solution and spread the word about aquaponics!  Image if you told someone about aquaponics and later learned they had a system large enough to help feed their entire family perpetually with healthy organic non-GMO foods! And that their food bill went down while their food security went up! What if someone you shared this information with started growing aquaponically and their health issues disappeared?  Or if someone went on a mission trip to a poor area and taught a community how to build and manage a large system fed their whole community?
By joining us in this movement today, not only will you receive a great product at areduced price, but you will also be helping to spread this powerful information! You don’t necessarily have to do great things with this knowledge yourself but what if someone you told or someone they told made a major difference in other people’s lives! Or maybe someone just visits your house and asks a question about that interesting thing with fish and plants sitting on your counter and they do something powerful with it!
While our small tabletop system is great to look at and
grow some herbs, it is the knowledge of aquaponics and sharing that knowledge
with others that can have a profound effect!
You Can Help, Even If You Don’t Realize It!

<p><strong>On June 19th</strong>, I woke up around 5:30 AM to thick black smoke filling my bedroom. I thought something in my apartment was on fire, but as I looked out of my living room window, I could see there was an intense fire 5 flights below. My building was on fire! I grabbed my immediate valuables and ran out of the building.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Everybody had evacuated and thankfully there were no deaths or serious injuries to our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""p1"">However, as I hit the city sidewalk, my first image was my neighbor and his white Samoyed (dog) covered in black soot. Stan looked like a coal miner. As he stood in his sock feet, I asked him what happened. He said ""This is all I could grab. My ID, some cash, and Cody."" He also had his cell phone in hand. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Sitting against the building was his metal apartment door, bent in half and brushed with fire. It looked like it was hit by an RPG.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A fireman approached us. Stan asked him how his apartment looked. The man responded, ""Everything is completely destroyed. Nothing is recognizable."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">Then the realization began to set in. After 17 years of calling this apartment his home, he must start anew. Without a pair of shoes, without a change of clothes. 17 years of valuables, sentimental and otherwise, gone forever.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I gave him my size 13 sneakers for his size 9 feet. </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Stan needs help getting a roof over his head again. He's currently bouncing around from place to place. His dog is boarding at a vet in Queens at $35/day. </strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>As of June 24, he is in Connecticut, staying at his newphew's friend's home, but unfortunately Stan can't stay there.</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>How We Can Help</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Everybody in my neighborhood knows Stan Katz and Cody Bear. They are begging to help him. So, I am starting a collection to give him assistance in any way possible.</p>

<li class=""p1"">Clothing</li>
<li class=""p1"">Hotel room or some sort of living arrangement</li>
<li class=""p1"">Care for his dog (grooming, food, boarding, etc)</li>
</ul><div>ALSO - If you know of anybody who has a room for rent, let me know. Stan is not looking for anything fancy. He told me he just wants a roof over his head and a place for his dog. If anybody has extra basement space, Stan said he will gladly accept it. </div>
<div>
<p class=""p2"">Stan did not have renter's insurance.</p>
<p class=""p2"">ANY donation is appreciated. Stan Katz must start all over.</p>

<h3>How Will Stan Get This Money?</h3>

<li>I have known Stan for 2 and a half years. I have his cell phone number and have been in touch with him every other day since the fire. I am personally responsible for ensuring that every single penny reaches his hands.</li>

<p>The Rockwell Model T is shaving, perfected. All other razors pretend everyone’s face and facial hair is the same, resulting in millions of men suffering from daily shaving irritation and overpaying for razor marketing gimmicks or subscriptions they don’t need. The Rockwell Model T is an intuitive, easy to use razor, with an adjustable dial that allows everyone to easily get a close and comfortable shave. Every Rockwell Model T comes with a pack of 100 Rockwell Stainless Steel Blades - that’s two years of blades included with your pledge!  Additional 100-packs of blades cost  just $10 - that’s only 10 cents a blade. The world needs an alternative to cartridge razors and unnecessary shave clubs - join the revolution! </p>

<p><b>Problem: </b>All multi-blade cartridges have a fundamental design flaw and your skin suffers for it. The problem is multiple blades, which can pull the hairs and cut them below skin level. When hairs are cut beneath the skin, they often curl and bend as they grow back, leading to skin irritation, and painful razor bumps. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrown_hair"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">There's even a Wikipedia article explaining this!</a></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Using a single blade razor like the Model T means no pulling and tugging is possible. Even better, the Model T is adjustable, which ensures that hair is never cut shorter than the surrounding skin. With an adjustable single blade razor you eliminate the causes of ingrown hairs, razor bumps and shaving irritation. </p>

</div></div>","The Rockwell Model T is shaving, perfected. All other razors pretend everyone’s face and facial hair is the same, resulting in millions of men suffering from daily shaving irritation and overpaying for razor marketing gimmicks or subscriptions they don’t need. The Rockwell Model T is an intuitive, easy to use razor, with an adjustable dial that allows everyone to easily get a close and comfortable shave. Every Rockwell Model T comes with a pack of 100 Rockwell Stainless Steel Blades - that’s two years of blades included with your pledge!  Additional 100-packs of blades cost  just $10 - that’s only 10 cents a blade. The world needs an alternative to cartridge razors and unnecessary shave clubs - join the revolution! 











Fully adjustable to your skin type and facial hair length - just twist the dial for your perfect shave.
Eliminates the skin irritation and razor bumps caused by multi-blade cartridge systems.
Easy blade-loading and intuitive shave settings make it easy to transition from cartridge razors with no nicks or cuts.
Includes a pack of 100 Rockwell Razor Blades - that's two years of blades.
No marketing gimmicks or subscriptions - just fantastic shaves.

















Not adjustable - cartridges are designed for some mythical ""average guy"" as if all men have the same skin type and facial hair. 
Cartridges can tug and pull on facial hair, causing many people to suffer from skin irritation, razor bumps, and razor burn.
Typical cartridges cost $3 to $5 each, which adds up fast - that's why they keep the cartridge razors behind the counter or in a locked glass vault. 
Relies on marketing gimmicks and celebrity endorsements to fool you into overpaying.







It's still a cartridge razor except it comes in the mail. So it's not adjustable and can still cause skin irritation and razor bumps. 
$1 to $3 per cartridge is still 10 to 30 times too much for a good razor blade! 
A funny commercial or fancy handle doesn't actually improve the quality of your shave. 
Most of that money is to pay the postal service to deliver your blades. 
You're still locked into a specific cartridge system with no options to change blade suppliers.







No one currently manufactures an easy to use, one piece, twist to open, adjustable razor.
Typically, these razors follow a multi-piece design or are not adjustable, so it can be more intimidating for those interested in switching to a classic razor from cartridge shaving.
















The Rockwell Model T allows you to adjust fluidly between shave settings 1 through 6, so you can customize the shave to your skin type and facial hair length by slightly adjusting the angle at which the blade cuts your hair.





Lower Rockwell Size settings (between 1-3) are for men with sensitive skin and are the perfect place to start a seamless transition from cartridge razor shaving with no nicks, cuts or discomfort.
Higher Rockwell Size settings (between 4-6) are for men with thick, coarse hair and men lining up a serious beard.















Problem: All multi-blade cartridges have a fundamental design flaw and your skin suffers for it. The problem is multiple blades, which can pull the hairs and cut them below skin level. When hairs are cut beneath the skin, they often curl and bend as they grow back, leading to skin irritation, and painful razor bumps. There's even a Wikipedia article explaining this!





Solution: Using a single blade razor like the Model T means no pulling and tugging is possible. Even better, the Model T is adjustable, which ensures that hair is never cut shorter than the surrounding skin. With an adjustable single blade razor you eliminate the causes of ingrown hairs, razor bumps and shaving irritation. 






Rockwell is a 100% Gimmick-Free Razor











The Rockwell Model T uses double-edge razor blades, which we sell for 10 cents each. We're also including 100 free Rockwell blades with the Model T for every backer - that's two years of shaving if you use one blade per week!










If you already have a favorite brand of double-edge blade, no problem.  The Rockwell Model T works with any double-edge blade on the market.  You’re not locked into a specific ""blade system"" or subscription. The choice of blade is always yours.





Gladly! It's very simple: cartridges can cost from $1 to $5 each, but double-edge razor blades are available for 10 cents each - from our site, Amazon, and most drug and grocery stores. We think our blades are the absolute best value on the market, but feel free to try other blades too - we're okay with an open relationship.















Adjustable Dial


The adjustable shave dial allows you to customize the Model T to your skin type and facial hair length. Simply twist the dial to adjust the blade angle to the perfect setting for your skin and facial hair.
Lower Rockwell Size settings (1-3) are great for men with sensitive skin, and are the perfect place to start for a seamless transition from cartridge razor shaving.
Higher Rockwell Size settings (4-6) are great for men with thick, coarse hair, as well as men shaving or lining up a serious beard. 

Twist-To-Open 
Twist the bottom of the handle to open the doors of the razor, allowing you to easily and safely load and replace blades.





Real Razor Blades, at an Unreal Price 

The Model T uses inexpensive universal double-edge razor blades.
As a backer, you'll receive a 100-pack of Rockwell Blades included in your pledge! 
Rockwell also sells the 100-pack of Rockwell Razor Blades for only $10 - that’s just 10 cents a blade! 







Knurled Grip 
The knurled handle ensures a secure, comfortable grip during each shave, while maintaining an elegant aesthetic.





Materials 

Chromed brass externals provide a timelessly appealing look. 
Coated brass internal components ensure extreme durability.





















Thanks for asking! Throwing out cartridges produces outrageous amounts of hazardous garbage every year. 










We'll keep you posted with transparent updates through all the production (and you can hold us to that). Here's how the production timeline looks right now:



This schedule is subject to change if there are unanticipated delays, but this isn't our first rodeo - we're confident we'll ship by March 2017.







We're keeping it simple. Each pledge gets the following:



















     





We've put 18 months into the design and testing of the Rockwell Model T to ensure it's not only an incredible razor and timelessly elegant, but that's it's also manufacturing-ready. Take a closer look!

</ul> </div> </div>","Cloud Farms was created around the idea that everyone should have access to clean, 
fresh, healthy food, and that we should all have the ability to grow 
some of our own. Cloud Farms is more than just this product; we hope to build a company that continues to develop tools for growing that are simple, beautiful, 
and enjoyable. Tools that enable even those without time, growing 
experience or access to outdoor space.


AMPHORA
A soilless, never-water planter for herbs.



The
 Cloud Farms AMPHORA uses hydroponics to grow fresh herbs, flowers, and 
small greens without any of the hassle of trying to grow with soil 
indoors. With a 1.5L water capacity, AMPHORA holds enough water for the 
lifetime of your plant, meaning there is no watering. Plus our seed kits
 come with everything you need to get growing. Fill it with water, add a
 shot of nutrient, plant your seeds, and come back in 5-6 weeks to harvest your fresh 
herbs. All you need is a sunny windowsill.

Goodbye Dirt. Goodbye watering.

AMPHORA
 holds enough water for the lifetime of an herb plant. Roots grow 
directly into the water and continue to descend as the water level 
drops. By the time the water has almost run out, you have a full grown 
plant.



Seed Kits for growing 8 plants

Every AMPHORA perk includes a seed kit. Every kit includes enough material to grow 8 times: 50 seeds, 8 
single-shot plant nutrient capsules, and 8 pieces of soil-less growing medium.
Seed Kit options:
BasilChivesCilantroLemon BalmOreganoParsley

If you claim an AMPHORA perk, we will reach out to you after the campaign to see exactly what kind of seeds you would like.

AMPHORA won't ship until March...

...but if you contribute for an AMPHORA perk we will send you a postcard right away that you can gift for the holidays.

<p>Seven Years ago, my family planned a holiday weekend getaway but had no one to water our Christmas Tree.  I wanted a solution. But there was none.</p>
<p>7 years, 4 prototypes, hundreds of revisions, countless tests, and the Christmas Tree Butler is ready!</p>
</div><div><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610726645/rgaz5ddm0eart58ftlr1.png"" src=""""/></h3></div><div>

<h2><strong>Easy Set Up!</strong></h2>
<p>Setting up your Christmas Tree Butler is easy and only take a few moments:</p>
<p>Fill your tree stand the first time, ensuring there are no leaks and your stand is level.</p>
<p>Fill Christmas Tree Butler's reservoir with water</p>
<p>Place the lid on the reservoir and Insert the Control Tower</p>
<p>Insert the Tree Attachment into your tree stand, making sure the “Fill To” line is below the top of the water</p>
<p>Secure the Tree Attachment to the tree by wrapping the shock cord around the trunk and snapping into the cleat</p>
<p>Plug the power adapter into the Control Tower and the wall outlet.</p>
<h2>Safe &amp; inexpensive to run</h2>
<p>Christmas Tree Butler uses an included 9 Volt power adapter to operate. Not only is it safe to use near water, but it’s also inexpensive to run! The power adapter accepts 100 -240 Volts, so yes you can use it in Europe, as long as you have an adapter.</p>
<h2>Fits any Tree or Tree Stand</h2>
<p>At the heart of the Christmas Tree Butler is The Tree Attachment, which monitors and delivers water to your tree stand. After years of engineering, we have developed a solution that is not only easy to attach to your tree, but also works with nearly any tree stand available on the market! Short, tall, narrow, wide: if it's out there, we made sure Christmas Tree Butler fits!</p>
<h2>Spill-Proof</h2>
<p>As an extra safety precaution, the Tree Attachment houses a tilt sensor that will stop the flow of water if the Tree Attachment is removed from your tree stand. </p>

<h2>A long weekend amount of water:</h2>
<p>Our reservoir holds 2 1/2 gallons of water, enough to supply your tree with several days of water! Handholds on the bottom of the reservoir make for secure transport from the kitchen sink, or you can just refill in place with a watering can or bottle.  </p>

<h2>Serious Electronics</h2>
<p>Using four circuit boards and two microcontrollers, our team of electronic engineers leveraged sophisticated water sensing and monitoring technology to make Christmas Tree Butler a truly hands-off system.</p>
<p>The Control Tower houses our Control Board.  The control board collects readings from the Tree Attachment every six tenths of a second and, using this data, it determines when to turn the pump on and when to turn it off.</p>
<p>As extra security, we’ve added sensors to shut off the pump if the Tree Attachment is pulled out of the stand, or if the pump runs too long. </p>

<h2>Sensor Technology</h2>
<p>In early versions, we tried using float switches, pressure sensors, and even electrical current sensors to determine when to turn the pump on and off. Float switches got stuck open or closed from debris. Pressure sensors weren’t accurate. And varying mineral content caused electrical sensors to become corroded.</p>
<p>Now we use electrically insulated strip electrodes, which are immune from debris and water mineral content. These highly accurate electrodes are non-invasive and won’t corrode, and there are no moving parts to break down or get bound up.</p>

<h2>Double Siphon Break</h2>
<p>One of our biggest breakthroughs was the implementation of double siphon breaks.</p>
<p>For use with a short tree stand, the siphon break in the <strong>reservoir</strong> prevents water from flowing into your tree stand after the pump has stopped.</p>
<p>If you have a tall tree stand, the siphon break in the <strong>Tree Attachment</strong> prevents water from flowing back into the reservoir, emptying your stand. </p>
<p>No matter where you place your tree, Christmas Tree Butler's double siphon break means water will flow only when and where it's needed.</p>

<h2>Low water alert</h2>
<p>When the reservoir gets low on water, a gentle beep alerts you that it’s time to refill the reservoir. Simply pour water through our easy-fill lid, or carry it to and from the kitchen sink with the easy-carry handholds.</p>

<p>Waycap for Dolce Gusto is a stainless steel, eco-friendly, infinitely reusable, compatible capsule for brewing a perfect espresso at home.</p>
<p>Enjoying a good espresso at home can be a true pleasure, a moment to take a break and savour the day. But we believe that it shouldn’t come at the expense of our planet’s health.</p>
<p>Did you know that every year around 15 billion capsules are sold around the world, producing thousand tons of waste that end up in landfills and our oceans?</p>
<p>By changing a small habit, we can make our contribution to the environment. While saving money and without foregoing the great taste of your favourite coffee.</p>
<p>With Waycap for Dolce Gusto you can stop wasting tons of disposable capsules and help protect our planet. You can save up to 1000 euros on coffee per year for a family of four. But, most importantly, you can regain control over your choices: use it with almost any grind and any coffee available on the market, whether it’s from your favourite brand or a local independent roaster.</p>

The pillow is one of the most important accessory to help us sleep better. After all, it keeps us comfortable and it is a direct pathway to a sweet slumber.Pillows are often side-tracked and people forget they are not just an additional accessory to a bed but rather a pillow is the cherry on top of the icing. Why not bring home the comfort we thought we could only get from 5-star hotels to yourself and your family? The right pillow Think about it, you sleep on the same pillow every single night. Whatever you do, you come home and desire a good night’s sleep. However, when it comes to buying the right one, we’re still in a dilemma.Cheap pillows tend to wear down after few sleeps. Even if you are willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right pillow can be a frustrating experience but we can change that for you.Besides, it is unable to accommodate all the different kinds of consumers. The foam could have an unbearable chemical smell or even uncomfortable. These inconveniences are something that we are forced to deal with and this have led us to create the ultimate pillow inspired from international 5 star hotels. It will certainly meet and match your expectations.  Say hello to Waikite PillowThis is where Waikite Pillow comes in. Anti-bacterial, odourless, firm and premium 5-star hotel pillow for your own home. After having studied hundreds of customer feedbacks, fabrics and types of pillows - we have created the ultimate one. We already know that international 5-star hotels’ pillows are still better than all the high tech pillows in the market. So we combined luxury with traditional materials and infused both world into one pillow.Allow great craftsmanship to change your lives. Natural Cotton best for your skin, no chemical smell, breathable, anti-bacterial, direct machine washable, luxurious, firm & self adjustable for your own sleeping preference. Traditional craftsmanship & premium featuresUsing traditional craftsmanship that goes well with 100% natural cotton balls, the craft ensures to protect the fibre from being destroyed while maintaining superior quality. In modern luxurious hotel, the bed sheets are made of organic fabric. This is why we can sleep bare skin and feel so comfortable. We are inspired by the concept of fine experience and so the name ‘Waikite” a Japanese expression which means ""THIS IS LIVING"" is created.Features 
No more invisible danger
Luxury sensation
No more neck pain
Quality lifestyle
No headache
Great for lifestyle 
No more muscle pain 
Suitable for any sleep position 
Safe for your love ones
Inspired by your fine taste in life, from the craftsmanship and design to the quality of sleep yielded.People with allergies no longer need to compromise with comfort as Waikite Pillow has used LENBING ANTIBACTERIAL TECHNOLOGY. This ensures that it is anti-bacterial. Feel secure when you lie on a Waikite Pillow. Composed of 100% natural cotton fibre stitched by traditional 133*100 high density stitching. The classic & 3d stitching style we used is premium weaving unlike rival brands that uses low-grade sewing. The look and feel of a pillow highly depends on the quality of cotton used. Most pillows are made of synthetic or inferior cotton in order to compromise with the cost but also making it uncomfortable to lay on. We only use traditional 100% natural cotton ball and we don’t believe in compromising! Unlike synthetic, it’s better for the skin and even easier to wash! Along with high density stitching, Waikite is better for your skin as it is breathable and hygienic – long lasting even when machine washed multiple times. Waikite pillow is made of allergen free synthetic spiral fibre that has great plush support that pleases all.Specially selected high elastic micro-fibre (spiral fibre) has very good ventilation and elasticity. This prevents heat trapping and provide maximum comfort for you. When you lie on it, it feels really luxurious and yet remains firm enough for the contour of your head. How long can you use it? Very long. The ends of the pillows are stitched with classic finishing, reinforced with 3D seals. This is the standard for high end pillows and Waikite Pillow has it too, making sure you have only the best experience with us. Using natural cotton means longer and more fibrous threads. These factors allow every pillow cover made from it to have high air circulation. It’s breathable that keeps you comfortable and cool throughout the night. Waikite pillow is as natural as it is and it does not have any chemical smell. Together with the breathability, any foul smell automatically gone as well.  Each of us has a different body shape and mass. The universal solution is to allow user to adjust the firmness of the pillow by adding or reducing the micro fiber. User would be able to have the best pillow for themselves.    You can customise Waikite Pillow to your perfect body, allowing a custom fit and optimal alignment to get the most out of your precious sleep whether you are a stomach sleeper, side sleeper or back sleeper.   Waikite Pillow is the best for urban lifestyle. You can use it as a support when you are reading, hugging it when writing and snuggling on the sofa with your loved one while watching movies. When it gets dirty, you can just put Waikite Pillow into the washing machine directly. No fuss at all. Once washed, take it out and dry it. It would be the same premium pillow as you first bought it - great for high humid countries. No special care is needed. After wash, you can just hang it and it dries very fast. Great for people living in the city too! This is not backed by data yet. Among 30% from our beta testers saying that their counter parts have actually reduce snoring when Waikite pillow is used. This feature would be quantified soon.  Waikite is working with a manufacturer that is supplying the pillows to the international 5-star hotels and resorts that have pass stringent tests. Therefore the Waikite pillow that you received soon will be the same when you stayed in 5-star hotels. We only added more features collected from beta testers to make it even more incredible for you! We strive to build an unbreakable trust and we guarantee you'll love the pillow. and If you aren't absolutely satisfied, return it within 30 days for a refund.

<br/>Who's beating the what?! What is Best Disease?<br/>
<p>'Beat the Best!' is a support network for those with Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (Best Disease). I, Ahmed Makkawy, along with my younger brother have the gene associated with this rare form of vision-loss. <br/><br/>To help visualize the effects of Best Disease and the cause for vision loss - here is a diagram of the eye (source: mib.org.uk):<br/><br/></p>

<br/>The macula is the part of the retina associated with color and central vision. Those with BVMD have a 'yolk-like' mass which hinders regular vision as light is projected onto the back of the eye. Below (source: mcw.edu) is an example of this genetic irregularity. The condition can be discovered and diagnosed in an individual at several stages. The most severe of which involve the mass seen below rupturing and ultimately leading to blindness in the individual. Early detection gives patients more time to get the education and support they need regarding Best Disease and the genetic testing needed to become involved in the latest stem cell research.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290481/files/20150312125025-BestsDisease_OCT_fovea.jpg?1426189825"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>In early 2009, I thought I'd harness the power of social media to find others who have BVMD to build a support network where I could find people in similar situations and how they are coping. I also had contacts in the research/medical field that allowed me to become a liaison of sorts with new studies and exciting treatments being made available to the public. <br/><br/>Here's what we've been able to do thus far : <ul> <li>Build a network of 1,000+ individuals on our Facebook page who actively engage in discussion, Q&amp;A, and help support one another with their stories and inspiration.</li> <li>Attended a SCORE (<a href=""http://www.score.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.score.org</a>) seminar and training to learn the ins/outs of successfully starting an international non-profit organization. </li> <li>Built a database of 1,500+ researchers, experts, and ophthalmologists around the globe to help connect members to the care and information they are seeking.  </li>

<p>At RelaksoHome, we’ve decided to turn to natural materials that have been used for centuries: <strong>Bamboo and Linen</strong>. While linen, obtained from the flax plant, has been used for clothing for thousands of years, it is only since the early 2000s that bamboo was made viable for clothing, thanks to research and new technologies. </p>
<p>Combined together, these two plants offer invaluable <strong>advantages on an environmental </strong>perspective. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike cotton, both plants can grow <strong>free of chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides</strong>, which helps improve soil and air quality. </li>
<li>Bamboo and linen use a <strong>1/3 less water than cotton to grow</strong>, which increases water supply for other usage. </li>
<li>Their transformation process uses <strong>less energy</strong> than other fibers, which decreases the emission of greenhouse gasses. </li>
</ul>
<p>By using these two materials, we end up with a product of a high ecological value that contributes in <strong>reducing soil, water and air pollution.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563373087/xndg1nqsqwutpklcejxq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“Lyocell” is actually a term used to describe the process a natural fibre goes through when transformed from a tree into a fabric. </p>
<p>Unlike other processes, Lyocell specifically designates a closed-loop process that <strong>recovers and reuses up</strong> to <strong>99% of the water and the organic compound</strong> needed, so no water is wasted unnecessarily. And YES: you have just read “organic compound”. That’s because no hazardous chemicals are involved in this process. Indeed, Lyocell is actually one of the <strong>MOST sustainable processes that exists</strong>.</p>

<p>Our bamboo and linen bed sheets are not only highly breathable, but also antibacterial and hypoallergenic by nature. This means that people suffering from skin problems will see their skin appearance improve. This is not only because your skin will “breathe better”, but because the soft texture of the bed sheets and pillows are naturally soothing to your skin.  </p>
<p>The bed sheets are also very hygienic as they do not retain odours and stains can easily be washed away. Your bed sheets will smell well and look nice.</p>

<p>Nowadays, more than 85% of the world’s home textile is produced in the Asia-Pacific region, where working conditions and environmental standards can be questioned. </p>
<p>One of the reasons why we turned to <strong>Portugal</strong> to manufacture our product is because we wanted to partner with a country that share similar values in terms of labour and environmental standards. This way, we rest assured that workers choose their employment freely and that child labour is out of question. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563373621/mvonxps5rllxfdiwlt9n.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Another reason why we turned to Portugal to manufacture our product is for their strong <strong>tradition and reputation</strong>. Indeed, Portugal has been known for centuries for offering the highest and finest quality in the home textile industry. </p>
<p>At the beginning of this project, we visited many facilities and met with skilled workers and professionals who transmitted us their passion and knowledge about their work. Our visits allowed us to <strong>bond with people who became passionate about our project</strong> and vision. They also invested a lot of their time and efforts to make our project possible. Feeling supported is crucial to ensure the continuity of our project, and we found it with our partner.</p>
<p>And… last but not the least: Portugal is among the top countries in the world committed to increase its <strong>renewable energy capacities</strong>. In fact, a great portion of the energy used for the manufacturing of our product comes from renewable energy. This is another good eco friendly reason to love our product! </p>

<p>For us, this project is very special and we wanted to spread our joy...</p>
<p>Even if our product is made with the highest sustainable standards, we wanted to do something extra for the planet. For this reason, we've decided to partner with an NGO and plant a tree for each support received. </p>
<p>This way, we help reducing our carbon footprint and contribute to reforest areas of the world that most need it. Because together, we can achieve great things. :-)</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already produced various samples of our bed sheets in different colours and sizes and have tested them out. Everything worked perfectly well! Some of our lucky friends and family are already enjoying the benefits of sleeping in our bed sheets.</p>
<p>Production is ready to go! <br/>Our manufacturing partner in Portugal is only awaiting for us to confirm the number of bed sets to be manufactured according to the colours and sizes. We are confident we will meet our time line, but if certain circumstances beyond our control may occur, we would let you know in advance. We’ll keep open and honest communication with you throughout the whole process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to be delivered to you. Please note that any custom charges outside the European Union will need to be satisfied by the backer.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","At RelaksoHome, we’ve decided to turn to natural materials that have been used for centuries: Bamboo and Linen. While linen, obtained from the flax plant, has been used for clothing for thousands of years, it is only since the early 2000s that bamboo was made viable for clothing, thanks to research and new technologies. 
Combined together, these two plants offer invaluable advantages on an environmental perspective. Here are a few highlights:

Unlike cotton, both plants can grow free of chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides, which helps improve soil and air quality. 
Bamboo and linen use a 1/3 less water than cotton to grow, which increases water supply for other usage. 
Their transformation process uses less energy than other fibers, which decreases the emission of greenhouse gasses. 

By using these two materials, we end up with a product of a high ecological value that contributes in reducing soil, water and air pollution.

“Lyocell” is actually a term used to describe the process a natural fibre goes through when transformed from a tree into a fabric. 
Unlike other processes, Lyocell specifically designates a closed-loop process that recovers and reuses up to 99% of the water and the organic compound needed, so no water is wasted unnecessarily. And YES: you have just read “organic compound”. That’s because no hazardous chemicals are involved in this process. Indeed, Lyocell is actually one of the MOST sustainable processes that exists.

Our bamboo and linen bed sheets are not only highly breathable, but also antibacterial and hypoallergenic by nature. This means that people suffering from skin problems will see their skin appearance improve. This is not only because your skin will “breathe better”, but because the soft texture of the bed sheets and pillows are naturally soothing to your skin.  
The bed sheets are also very hygienic as they do not retain odours and stains can easily be washed away. Your bed sheets will smell well and look nice.

Our Lyocell Bamboo and Linen bed sheets offer a perfect balance:
1. Unlike 100% linen bed sheets, our bed sheets do not wrinkle easily and;
2. unlike 100% bamboo bed sheets, they do not look super shiny. 
With our blend, you obtain a perfect look with a nice and soft touch. You get all the advantages of both fibres, without the inconveniences! 


 Are you ready to upgrade your well being in bed? 

Our RelaksoHome bed sheets are designed for real life needs and to bring you that extra comfort you need to make your bed the best place ever. 
Because your well being is at the top of our priority, our bed sheets offer you: 

Reinforced seams and hems with double stitching to ensure quality and durability.  
An adjustable fitted sheet all over the edge to keep the sheet tight and perfectly adjusted to your mattress when you move. 
An extra long flat sheet that can be placed easily below your mattress so your feet stay in.
Pillow cases with a flap closure to ensure your pillows stay protected and clean. The flap closure also adds an elegant touch to your bed. 
A duvet cover with visible and delicate buttons closure to ensure the duvet stays in place. 
Natural, modern and minimalist look to bring peace and calmness to your bedroom, ensuring your bed sheets stay forever elegant and age well with time. 


Remember: with our bed sheets, you acquire a high quality and long lasting good, which will make you save money over the long term. That’s just another reason to love our bed sheets!

Nowadays, more than 85% of the world’s home textile is produced in the Asia-Pacific region, where working conditions and environmental standards can be questioned. 
One of the reasons why we turned to Portugal to manufacture our product is because we wanted to partner with a country that share similar values in terms of labour and environmental standards. This way, we rest assured that workers choose their employment freely and that child labour is out of question. 

Another reason why we turned to Portugal to manufacture our product is for their strong tradition and reputation. Indeed, Portugal has been known for centuries for offering the highest and finest quality in the home textile industry. 
At the beginning of this project, we visited many facilities and met with skilled workers and professionals who transmitted us their passion and knowledge about their work. Our visits allowed us to bond with people who became passionate about our project and vision. They also invested a lot of their time and efforts to make our project possible. Feeling supported is crucial to ensure the continuity of our project, and we found it with our partner.
And… last but not the least: Portugal is among the top countries in the world committed to increase its renewable energy capacities. In fact, a great portion of the energy used for the manufacturing of our product comes from renewable energy. This is another good eco friendly reason to love our product! 

For us, this project is very special and we wanted to spread our joy...
Even if our product is made with the highest sustainable standards, we wanted to do something extra for the planet. For this reason, we've decided to partner with an NGO and plant a tree for each support received. 
This way, we help reducing our carbon footprint and contribute to reforest areas of the world that most need it. Because together, we can achieve great things. :-)


Because we are concerned about the future of our planet, our bed sheets will be carefully delivered to you in an elegant and eco-friendly packaging, free of plastic. This way, we make sure your experience is consistent with our values.  :-)


We'll email you a survey after the campaign to get your shipping address, colour and size preferences. 
Feel free to ask us if you need help with your size, note that there we will be more sizes available.


Elegant and minimalist, our colours will stay intact wash after wash! Our three launch colours are: WHITE, LIGHT GREY AND AQUA GREEN. 

Please note that it is one colour per set. If you choose to buy two sets, then you'll get to choose two different colours (and can mix them at home after!).
At the end of the campaign, you will be able to choose your preferred colour through the survey that will be sent to you. 
*Please note the colours may differ from one device to another depending on the calibration of your screen.

API

emberlight app is built on a RESTful API with a realtime component for sending commands to devices. OAuth mechanism will become available for developers to create applications on the emberlight platform. Stay tuned for the release.





Shipping

We have cleared certifications for North America and have started our production ramp. Our first batch of products were shipped to early beta backers of our original campaign already. We are now producing units for all of our original campaign backers which will be shipped in February 2016.  If you preorder now, you will get a unit from our second batch in March 2016.

Hi and welcome to Viralio (Viral I/O as in Input/Output)

My name is Angelos and I've been in the market of web development and internet marketing since the .com BOOM. 


A few years ago I've teamed up with a group of another 5 highly specialized programmers and IT professionals and we've been cooking software and websites ever since. Projects like BeepXtra and others gave us the challenges we needed to expand our reach and knowledge.

The problem is, there is too much to handle in the technology field. We know it from experiences we've had with clients, and I am sure you see it too.

Having a website today is almost mandatory. But is that enough?

You don't just need a freebie website to succeed. You need a professionally designed and managed website, that is both functional and responsive in the various internet enabled devices that people use today. PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones... Then there's browsers, then there is compatibility, screen resolutions, speed performance, hosting.... POUF !!!

STOP THERE... That's way too much to handle for a business man, and IT Companies charge thousands to cover all of the above aspects (note: IF they are capable !!! )

Already got a website?
Even if you already have and love your website, you probably need to see what else Viralio is capable of!!! Viralio can integrate with your existing site, and increase your online presence. Read further for more info!!!

Now What? Is That Enough?
Say you made it... got a brilliant website for the world to see... So now what?

You need to promote it, social media pages like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin... and who is going to keep all these updated? You? Or the IT Companies you pay thousands to do it for you?

We, ourselves ALSO need this product
A simple interface to make it happen. A Wizard style, step by step, that would quickly gather the information and create a professional website for your business.

Light, thermostat and sprinkler control to give you an idea, but the possibilities are limitless! Contribute now and start taking control of your home.NEW! NOW WIRELESS!!!EZcontrol.IT is proudly part of the official Arduino™ AtHeart program.EZcontrol.IT is also made in Italy and quality is our main goal.The HardwareEZboard is a low power consumption Arduino™ compatible board, equipped with an onboard WiFi controller, microSD card socket, temperature sensor, and power relay.The board was designed to run for long periods of time powered by batteries, as low as 3.7V (common value for a LiPo pack) and it integrates all the hardware necessary to implement most of the common applications for Home Automation.Light control, Thermostat, Temperature logging, Sprinkler control, are all application that can be implemented without the use of any external components. All with the simplicity of any other Arduino™ compatible board.EZboard comes with the libraries, the code, and even the basic program already installed, so you don't need to do anything else other then open the box, plug it in, and start to control anything you want!The SoftwareWhile hardware has been affordable and accessible for a long time, the software platform is the real hurdle, when implementing an efficient and affordable Connected Home.Lelylan is the solution.This is a very easy to use Home Automation cloud platform, universally compatible with any device capable of being connected to the web, that allows you to connect and control the EZboard, and any other device based on Arduino™, Raspberry PI™, Electric imp™, mBed™, Flyport™, Nanode™ and many more.Lelylan is based on the MQTT protocol (MQ Telemetry Transport), the same used by Facebook to send live updates to the mobile messaging applications, and offers a simple API that can be used to program basically any platform. The front end is totally editable as well, and the API for the user interface is available for Curl, Ruby, Node.js, Angular JS and Python.Because a standard user interface is already available, you don't need to be a developer to use and enjoy Lelylan. Plus, the ready to use interface is based on AngularJS, HTML5 and CSS3, so you can use it on any mobile device without installing any app.The advantage for anyone who is not familiar with software development is that Lelylan comes with a fully implemented universal user interface, so you can connect and control your devices without knowing how to write a single line of code!The MatchEZboard was designed after Lelylan, so it's specifically optimized to interact with the control platform. While the two projects are independent, with the hardware and the software designed by different groups, the advantage of EZcontrol.IT is the integration of the two.You will get both the Hardware and the Software, together working as a perfect Match.This is the real deal! Lelylan can be used with any piece of hardware, including the one you already have, and EZboard is a fully Arduino™ compatible, low power consumption, development platform. Together the two are a plug&play, easy to implement, and extremely affordable platform for the Internet of Things.The perks for this campaign includes both the Hardware and the lifetime long subscription to the Software platform, that can be used with any device, not only ours, for basically half the cost of the two separated!The Basic Match - to start controlling things at only $45 (or less if you act fast)1 EZboard WiFi + Lifetime Lelylan platform for 1 deviceThe Makers Match - with two devices to control and interact at only $79 (or less if you act fast)2 EZboard WiFi + Lifetime Lelylan platform for 2 devicesThe Space Odyssey Match - to give a HAL 9000 power to your place at only $1795 EZboard WiFi + Lifetime Lelylan platform for 5 devicesThe Business Match - takes you to the next level with ten boards and Lelylan Premium (unlimited)10 EZboard WiFi + Lifetime Lelylan premium platform for unlimited devicesYou can choose your Perk right now, on the right side of this page, and start to dream about your very own Connected Home.Or keep reading to get even more information :-)About the HardwareTHIS IS THE ALL NEW WiFi EDITION OF THE EZboard!!!EZboard was designed to be, as much as possible, compatible with Arduino™, but at the same time capable of offering more functions and lower power consumption.The result is a development board that is only 9mm (0.35"") longer than an original Arduino™ UNO, adopting the same footprint but offering additional functions.Compared to an Arduino™ UNO, the EZboard offers: full Internet capability over WiFi (new), microSD card reader, a relay rated 5 Ampere (new), and a TMP36 temperature sensor.Everything on the EZboard has been designed to minimize power consumption. For this reason the microcontroller Atmel ATMEGA328P is configured to work a 3.3V and 8MHz of speed. While this could sound like a limit, we have verified that it is more than enough for Home Automation applications.The EZboard is a wireless device based on WiFi connectivity! This thanks to the adoption of the CC3000 WiFi adapter from Texas Instruments:We have designed the EZboard to be ready for any kind of hack, including advanced programming of the WiFi module. The design of the EZboard allows to update the firmware of the TI CC3000 module without use any additional device!The power source could be the USB adapter supplied with the board, but the EZboard was designed to receive power mostly by batteries, the EZboard has a dedicated input that uses 0.1"" pitch connectors like the common JST or even direct soldering of a battery pack to the board.The whole board is running at 3.3V, but is 5V tolerant and the use of shields designed for Arduino™ will work at 5V without damaging the board (only the SPI is not compatible with 5V).The power circuit is designed to be, as much as possible, efficient while working with batteries and we have dedicated particular efforts in the research of solutions to lower the power consumption.The USB interface is based on the widely used FT232RL converter from FTDI, that offers drivers and compatibility for every computing platform. This device is separated from the board and we provide it in form of USB adapter. This means that when the EZboard is not connected to a computer and is not sending or receiving communications on the USB, the adapter is not necessary and will save energy.The temperature sensor and the onboard relay allows to develop advanced projects, like a connected thermostat, without requiring any additional components, but a battery pack. Why spend so much for a Nest™?!?Also you can see that in order to reduce interference and to protect the low voltage circuits, the area related to the relay, that could be connected to high voltage, is physically isolated trough a cut in the PCB from the rest of the board.The temperature sensor, a very common and well supported TMP36, is located as far as possible from the power regulator and from any device that could heat up during normal working conditions, this is to avoid false readings of the actual temperature, due to the proximity of warm components.Technical specifications:

The Arduino™ AtHeart program is designed for makers and companies wishing to make their products easily recognisable as based on the Arduino™ technology.EZboard is a licensed product. This means that part of your contribute will be received directly by Arduino™ to support the development of the IDE.We are extremely proud to present the first project ever published on Indiegogo officially licensed by Arduino™!About the SoftwareLelylan is a simple and open API to build the Connected Home where makers can focus on the hardware and on the design process, while developers create new apps for the web, the mobile, and much more.Any request sent to the Lelylan API is forwarded to the physical device, which is in charge of applying the desired changes and of sending back a message to Lelylan when those changes are made.Lelylan is based on three resources:DevicesA Device is a resource virtually representing everything you interact with everyday of your life. You interact with lights, appliances, alarms, cooling and heating systems, gas sensors, rolling shutters, windows, irrigation, video surveillance, gates, multimedia (audio and video), and much more. With a Device you can simulate, monitor, and control any of those devices through a unique URl.PhysicalsIf Devices are a virtual representation, Physicals are the real objects you interact with, everyday of your life. To enable the communication between Lelylan and the physical world, the physical device must be able to connect to the Internet and to implement the Physical API.TypesA Type describes the structure of a device. Lelylan has started to define the most used ones, but anyone, can create new ones. In its simplest form, every Type can be defined as the combination of three key elements.

Properties - what vary during time.


Functions - what a device can do.


Statuses - what a device is in a specific time of its life.

It works in 3 easy steps:The dashboardA Dashboard developed with AngularJS to create, control, and monitor all of your devices with realtime notifications when one of your devices changes its status.The dashboard is the solution for you to create and control all of your devices, without writing any software.And the dashboard is available on any device, including smartphones and tablets from any manufacturer. It's not necessary to install any app!Know more about the dashboard: http://manage.lelylan.com/learnYou can also give Lelylan a try, following this link: http://try.lelylan.comYou will receive a lifetime subscription from Lelylan, together with your EZboard. Also the board will come pre-loaded with software that allows you to immediately plug it in and start to control things.The subscription you will receive is the Makers plan from Lelylan, valued at $29US. If you request a perk that includes more than one EZboard, then you will also receive the support for the additional devices, valued at $10US each.Who we areWe are a group of engineers and software developers from the North East of Italy, not far from Venice to give you a point of reference. Lelylan was developed since 2010 by a group of programmers as an open platform for an easier and accessible Connected Home. We met in a maker space and started to share ideas, that became in time what you are seeing now.We have designed and tested the EZboard for several months, messing around in the house and playing with different solutions, starting from the breadboard until we got to the final design that you can enjoy today.What we want to doThe EZboard is well tuned and tested now, while the Lelylan platform has been in final beta for over half a year.It's time to take it to the next level. This means offering users around the world access to the cloud platform, together with the easy to use and affordable hardware.Why IndiegogoTo make it affordable we need to produce a first run of minimum 500 EZboards. This is the only way to reduce the costs.Everything is ready and we have signed already the manufacturing agreement with an Italian company that works for some of the largest brands in our country, like Olivetti and Telecom Italia group: Erregi Elettronica S.r.l.With this campaign on Indiegogo you can have the opportunity to be the first to benefit from this perfect match of Hardware and Software, at an incredible discounted price!The retail price of the EZboard, after the campaign, will not be lower than US$40, while the price for the Lelylan platform is already set at US$29. So in the future this match will cost at least US$69, but during this Indiegogo campaign you can pay much less, saving up to 50% if you act fast and catch an Early Bird offer.FulfillmentHow long it will takeWe decided to set the shipping time a bit far in the future, four months after the end of this campaign. This is because we won't take the risk of disappointing you. The CPU used for the EZboard is the same one used on the Arduino™ UNO SMD, or other compatible devices like the RedBoard™ from Sparkfun™: Atmel's ATMEGA328P. While this CPU is often available, for a few hundreds of thousands of pieces, from the common distributors like Digikey or Mouser, in case of missing stock the usual lead time is 6-12 weeks. This means that if the CPU will be out of stock at the time this campaign ends, when it is time for us to order the parts, then we could wait up to three months.It's unlikely and we believe we will be able to ship in advance, but we must be real and take into account any risk of delay.We don't want to promise a fast turn and then send you a message announcing delays, after the end of the campaign. We believe in a serious approach and so we want to make clear that this is the longest time you could wait.We have already selected the manufacturer. The production will be Made in Italy. We also don't know how many boards we will need to produce, at the end, and we will need to test and program all, one by one, so it's better to choose a safe shipping date, and be sure to be able to keep the promise.We think it will take less time and we could ship in advance, but we can't guarantee it.Shipment is quite expensiveWe will produce and ship from Italy. Postage is expensive here :-(We could choose to produce in Asia and ship from there, at a fraction of the cost. But we wanted to offer something different and have full control of all aspects of the fulfillment.We hope you will understand that a few more dollars of cost are due to the quality and nothing else.Because we can't predict the location where we will need to ship, we haven't included the shipping costs in the value of the perks. Please don't forget to add the amount to cover the shipping costs to the total of your contribution. This is equal to US$10 for shipments to Italy and US$16 for the rest of the world.Thanks for your contribution to our project and welcome to a Better Connected World!Disclaimer: Trademarked names, logos, and images may appear in this page.

<p>Awesome! We're upgrading all Pinoccio boards to the ATmega256RFR2 microcontroller. It’s lower-power when receiving on the mesh network (it uses way less battery), and it has double the flash memory — 256k instead of the original 128k listed on our specs. Double up!</p>
<hr/><h1>About Pinoccio</h1>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Every Pinoccio is wireless</strong> - Every Pinoccio Scout has a rechargeable battery and a built-in radio for mesh networking. Scouts talk to each other wirelessly and have a range similar to your home's wireless router.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>WiFi made easy</strong> - Easily connect projects to the Web over WiFi. Your Scout will be talking to the Web within minutes of unboxing. You only need one Lead Scout — the Scout with a WiFi backpack — to connect dozens of Scouts to the Web. The WiFi shield also has a micro SD card slot for logging data.</p>
<p class=""p1""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/577251/files/20140513112651-pinoccio-lead-scout.jpg?1400005611"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><strong>Arduino-compatible </strong> - Yep! You can use the Arduino IDE to program Pinoccio Scouts. The code for many existing Arduino projects will work with Pinoccio.</p>
<p><strong>Mesh networking</strong> - Connect multiple Pinoccio boards to the Web wirelessly, all via one Pinoccio Lead Scout. If you have a Scout that's out of WiFi range, the others will route its data up to the Web.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/577254/files/20140513112717-pinoccio-field-scout.jpg?1400005637"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><strong>Rechargeable battery included</strong> - Every board has a LiPo battery that charges via micro USB. A single charge lasts days to weeks — even months on a single charge (depends on how you're using the boards).</p>
<p><strong>An API</strong> - A free, real-time, streaming REST API. Use our API, or roll your own, it's up to you. Our API lets you stream data out of each and every Scout. That means you'll be notified instantly when something changes (pin values, LED, temperature, etc). You can also stream your own reports through the API, and effortlessly query historical data.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/577264/files/20140513112929-hq-evironmental.gif?1400005769"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Pinoccio HQ</b> - Push code updates over-the-air using our light-weight scripting language called ScoutScript. No more waiting to compile and upload. Just type <b>led.red</b> and watch your Scout's LED turn red immediately, all wireless. Send commands from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Open source</strong> </strong> - Pinoccio is open-source hardware, which means that you can download the schematics, the board layout, and the bootloaders and do with it what you like. We host all of our files on the <a href=""https://github.com/Pinoccio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Github page</a>.</p>

<h3>We Need $60,000 to Make Pinoccio Happen</h3>
<p><strong>Produce the first run of boards</strong> - We've been prototyping via small — and expensive — batches of boards. We're currently on our 9th revision, the hardware is dialed in, and we're ready for you to start building on Pinoccio. However, the only way to make Pinoccio affordable for everyone is to do a large production run of the boards. $50,000 is the minimum amount we need for assembly and manufacture of the first run of boards.</p>
<p>With our perks, you'll be the first wave of Makers, Artists, Musicians, Hackers, and Educators to build on the Pinoccio platform. <strong>We strongly recommend the Pinoccio Starter Kit at $149.</strong> With the Starter Kit, you'll get 2 Pinoccio Scouts — each with its own rechargeable LiPo battery, 1 WiFi backpack, and 1 micro USB cable for charging. You can start building any number of interesting wireless projects with the Pinoccio Starter Kit.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Shipping outside the U.S.</strong><br/>For International Shipping of rewards $49 and up, you'll need to add an extra $12. How do you add this money? When you select a contribution level, you'll be prompted to enter the total contribution amount just below. Add the $12 to the cost of the reward there.</p>
<p><strong>What if I forgot to add the $12 for international shipping?</strong><br/>After the project is funded and we're ready to ship, we'll contact each contributor to confirm shipping details. If you didn't add shipping when you contributed, you can add it then.</p>

THANK YOU!
We did it! With your help, we reached our funding goal, and beyond.
STRETCH GOALS

If we reach $85,000

WE REACHED $85,000!
Great job everyone! We reached the goal! Every funder at the $49 level and higher received 1 free Proto Shield in their perk shipment. Go build cool stuff!

If we reach $95,000

WE REACHED $95,000!
Awesome! We're upgrading all Pinoccio boards to the ATmega256RFR2 microcontroller. It’s lower-power when receiving on the mesh network (it uses way less battery), and it has double the flash memory — 256k instead of the original 128k listed on our specs. Double up!
About Pinoccio
Every Pinoccio is wireless - Every Pinoccio Scout has a rechargeable battery and a built-in radio for mesh networking. Scouts talk to each other wirelessly and have a range similar to your home's wireless router.
WiFi made easy - Easily connect projects to the Web over WiFi. Your Scout will be talking to the Web within minutes of unboxing. You only need one Lead Scout — the Scout with a WiFi backpack — to connect dozens of Scouts to the Web. The WiFi shield also has a micro SD card slot for logging data.
Arduino-compatible  - Yep! You can use the Arduino IDE to program Pinoccio Scouts. The code for many existing Arduino projects will work with Pinoccio.
Mesh networking - Connect multiple Pinoccio boards to the Web wirelessly, all via one Pinoccio Lead Scout. If you have a Scout that's out of WiFi range, the others will route its data up to the Web.Rechargeable battery included - Every board has a LiPo battery that charges via micro USB. A single charge lasts days to weeks — even months on a single charge (depends on how you're using the boards).
An API - A free, real-time, streaming REST API. Use our API, or roll your own, it's up to you. Our API lets you stream data out of each and every Scout. That means you'll be notified instantly when something changes (pin values, LED, temperature, etc). You can also stream your own reports through the API, and effortlessly query historical data.Pinoccio HQ - Push code updates over-the-air using our light-weight scripting language called ScoutScript. No more waiting to compile and upload. Just type led.red and watch your Scout's LED turn red immediately, all wireless. Send commands from anywhere in the world.
Open source  - Pinoccio is open-source hardware, which means that you can download the schematics, the board layout, and the bootloaders and do with it what you like. We host all of our files on the Github page.
A community - The Pinoccio Community is a place where you can share ideas, projects, code, help each other out, and collaborate on projects.  Want to join the discussion?  The community forums are open!

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Most of you know I've been doing street medic stuff for a long time; I started doing it in 2004 so that's about 8 years or so. I am planning to go to the G8/NATO conference happening this May 19th-22nd to support people with my knowledge of emergency medicine and first aid. I believe very strongly in the need for medical support in states of exception, where the existing societal support networks fail to work. Which is more often than not at convergences like the G8. I'm a little worried about having the money to get there and back considering I haven't been able to get work recently. Or anytime in recent memory, really. So basically I'm sparechanging over the internet.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT Y'ALL: So the G8 has been moved out of Chicago. The NATO conference is still happening, and protests are still happening, so I'm still going. The end. </strong></p>
<p>Also, I've been struggling to fund an art project that involves lighting myself on fire. So I'm combining the two.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are several methods I can use to light myself on fire, some more spectacular than others. The most interesting one is (of course) the most complicated and expensive. I've already put more than $150 into the fire project and it's not something I can continue while I don't have a steady income. I shelved lighting myself on fire for about 3 months because of lack of funds but resurrected it because it seemed like a great way to say thank you. Also, it's really freakin' cool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you are unfamiliar with street medics and what we do, I would recommend this article:</strong> <a href=""http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/133998-anarchistic-and-self-trained-are-street-medics-th/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anarchistic and Self-Trained Are Street Medics the Future of First Aid?</a></p>
<p>""Errico"" (quoted in the article) is a longtime comrade and was part of the disaster relief team I worked with in Haiti. </p>
<p>If you are interested in street medic protocols there is a street medic wiki: <a href=""http://medic.wikia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://medic.wikia.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>If you are unfamiliar with what the G8 is: </strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8</a></p>
<p>TL;DR? The G8 is a meeting where the richest countries in the world congratulate each other on being rich and discuss how to stay rich. It is a closed meeting with no accountability.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Chicago gets another experienced street medic and Wilderness EMT during a very important and in my opinion almost sure to be a dangerous and pivotal convergence. Also, you get to see me light myself on fire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anything I don't use on G8 travel or immolation supplies will be donated to either getting other medics to the G8, directly to the clinic at the G8, or to legal and prisoner support.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Travel and food and first aid supplies will be the bulk of what donations will be spent on, with supplies for a successful and safe self immolation coming second. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you get:</p>
<p>You get to see me light myself on fire. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Actually, this idea came out of wanting to have a gallery opening of my photos of arson. While trying to plan something more interesting than just a gallery opening where everyone gets drunk while pretending they're not bored I thought it might be fun to invite fire performers. Then I was all; ""Why don't I light <em>myself</em> on fire?"" Because that was a completely logical thought, I proceeded to research different ways to do it, and enlisted the help of several amazing and helpful people along the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fire performers are still invited, and there might be surprises as well. Consider that an open call to bring your poi and staffs and whatever else you play with.</p>

<p><strong><u>Simple
Operation</u></strong></p>
<p>Since there are no complicated electronic systems,
the operation is so simple that it can be operated in any bucket (minimum 20
liters, ideally 25/30) in your house, hence plumbing, wiring etc. is not required. 
Simply plug and operate.</p>
<p><strong><u>Powerful
Wash </u></strong></p>
<p>Even in the case of regular washing machines you
will have to use a brush to remove dirt from places like shirt collars,
underarms etc. The vertical rotation method of Mini Washing Machine removes
dirt from different places like shirt collar and gives clothes unmatched
cleaning. Kids clothes can be washed separately and hygienically. Delicate
clothes can also be washed without any damages.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>We now seek your help.</b> Whatever money we
could, we have invested in the engineering and mold development. We now have a
fully tested machine ready to be mass produced. In order to mass produce it and
keep the price low for the poor people of India and other parts of the world to
buy, we need to make them in a certain quantity.</p>
<p><b>Millions of families in
India &amp; elsewhere still can’t afford the regular washing machines. Additionally,
while many can, they do not have sufficient place to keep the bulky machines in
their 1 room homes. Millions do not have running water connection in their
homes to use the traditional washing machines. These people are forced to wash
their clothes manually which is not only physically taxing, but also time
consuming. Manual washing also consumes more water…a fast depleting commodity
worldwide!!!</b></p>
<p><b>For all
these people, the VENUS, is the alternative.</b></p>

</div><div> <p>Women in poor families wash clothes by hand. To do this, they have to squat on the floor and rub the clothes vigorously.

<p>VENUS will help prevent this to a large extent. <b>Your small contribution will help millions of suffering women and prevent this from happening to the future generations of women.</b> Also this will save women time to do extra work and most importantly save enormous amount of precious water since manual cleaning results in more water usage than what is actually required.

<p>Sujata is a maid who lives with her 2 children in a single room shanty
in suburban Mumbai. She earns her livelihood by doing housework in residential
apartments near her home. We gave her one VENUS to use and she has been using
it for over 3 months now. </p>
<p>This is what she has to
say <i>“Earlier washing my
husband’s, my kids’ and my own clothes used to take me almost an hour. Now I do
it in less than 20/25 minutes. This extra time has allowed me to work in an extra
home and increase my income. Also now I do not feel any burden in washing
clothes. I used to be very tired after scrubbing clothes in the past. Before
using this machine, I required almost 5 buckets of water to wash the clothes.
Now I am able to do it in just 3 buckets of water. This is perhaps the biggest
advantage as we do not have water connection in our shanties and I have to
bring water from a distant municipal tap early morning everyday after standing
in a queue. All my neighbors are now asking for this machine &amp; keep borrowing it from me.”</i></p>
<p><b>STORY BEHIND THIS PRODUCT</b></p>
<p>8 years ago my late mother had brain surgery and was
rendered paralyzed and bed ridden. During this time, one of the biggest
challenges we faced was washing her soiled bed sheets and clothes. Washing them
in the regular washing machine was neither advisable nor hygienic and the
bathroom had to be cleaned thoroughly after they were washed in there.</p>
<p>It
is then, when I thought of a portable washing machine that can do the same work
as a regular machine and yet be easy to clean. With the help of an engineer
friend and an old photo from the internet we came up with the idea of a PORTABLE
washing machine that can be mounted on any bucket for easy use. This solved all
our problems. The mess washed in the
bucket was easy to dispose off and the bucket easily cleaned without fear of
contamination.</p>
<p>Needless
to say that what I used during my mom’s time was a very crude prototype. Since
then, I have had several friends and relatives ask me for such a washing
machine. Encouraged by this, we carried out a small survey to ascertain whether
there is a market for such a product. We found out that there is indeed a
demand. Honestly, we were not surprised since such a device has several
advantages and makes sense to use in some very practical yet compelling
situations as described above.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So
we set out to make a proper </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">PORTABLE , MINI &amp; MOBILE WASHING MACHINE</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.
Since I had already used the initial prototype for a considerable period of
time, we had the necessary practical experience to make the necessary changes
and perfect the design. We drew inspiration from a very old design we saw photo of on the internet and used it as the base to develop our product keeping in mind that it should be compact, light weight and easy to use in any condition. </span></p>
<p><b>The result is VENUS, the machine you saw in the video.</b></p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b></p>
<p><b>We don't claim to be the inventor of this design. We have re-modeled a very old design which was inefficient, power consuming big and bulky (it was designed to work with a drum) and developed it into a compact, energy efficient light weight working model that can be mounted on a bucket as small as 15 liters and as big as 25 liters. Also the super insulating feature is absolutely new and all Venus will be shipped with this. Venus is a completely re-engineered, absolutely safe device.</b></p>

Products that have great utility for the general public and especially benefit
the poor.</span><br/></p>
<p>The group that works for Vimbas is highly
driven to contribute back to the society. It is this determination that
inspired us to develop <b>VENUS – THE MINI PORTABLE WASHING MACHINE</b> for the
poor people. My deceased mother used to say, it is better to make money - but it's better to make it by doing something that benefits the underprivileged...This is my first step towards this goal. I seek partners like you.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Guided by this philosophy, we have selected
few other socially relevant projects for the future. However, it will be
premature to talk about them at this stage. Our priority right now is to make
VENUS a success. </span><br/></p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Selection
of motor was the most challenging aspect of this product design. Since we
wanted to mount the device on a plastic bucket, the overall weight of the
device was of prime concern. We had to ensure that we can wash maximum possible
load with a powerful, yet light enough motor so that the device weight does not
become unbearable for the plastic bucket. </p>
<p>Since we are using 110/220 volts of alternating current to power the device, we were aware of the natural fear of electric shock that people have. Extra care has been taken to ensure that under no circumstance can there be a danger of electrical shock. <b>The motor and electrical points have been sprayed with a special chemical imported from Russia. This super insulating coating makes all electrical devices WATERPROOF - even when live current is on.</b></p>

<p>Most importantly, unlike others, we are not seeking funds to develop a product. We already have done all the required R&amp;D and have a tried &amp; tested product on hand. This automatically lowers the risk involved significantly.</p>
<p><b>RAW MATERIALS AVAILABILITY AND SUPPLY</b></p>
<p>While
robust marketing is essential to keep sales going, it is equally important to
maintain an uninterrupted supply of all required components. With over 20 years
of experience in production and sales, our team is fully knowledgeable and
capable to handle any situation and yet ensure that the production lines are
never short of parts. We have developed relations with multiple vendors and
this will be our backup should any one vendor fail. The device body is
injection molded and this work is done by a vendor with whom we have working
relationship for the last 10 years.</p>

</div></div>","Are you okay with using Public machines in Laundromats?
Different people have different hygiene levels...

1) It is not hygienic to wash the dirty cloths used for mopping the floors, toilets and kitchen platforms in the regular washing machine. Use VENUS to wash them separately in a bucket which later can easily be cleaned and disinfected.
2) Children love to play in the mud and cleaning such clothes in the regular washing machines leaves a mess behind inside the tub. Cleaning this mess is an avoidable tiresome chore. Use VENUS for such washes.
3) Wash infant’s messy clothes without fear of contaminating regular laundry.
4) Wash patient’s clothes with VENUS
5) Use VENUS to wash clothes that leak/shed color.
6) People who are often on the road like salesman, can carry this compact machine and wash clothes easily in hotel bathrooms, thus saving money!!!
VENUS easily fits in a small backpack 
 

EACH & EVERY BACKER WILL RECEIVE THEIR REWARD REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THIS CAMPAIGN

ADVANTAGE OF THIS DESIGN OVER OTHER PORTABLE WASHING MACHINES
* Lightest of the lot* Extremely easy to carry around during picnics and camping trips.* Most hygienic since you clean in an open bucket which can easily be washed and disinfected.* Can be used by anyone, even a child* Easy to store in smallest of the place* Ideal for dormitory students.* Ideal for people living in places far from a Laundromat.* Virtually Maintenance free

IMPORTANT PLEASE NOTE

All Venus that will be shipped to backers will come with an AUTO POWER OFF feature. This means that even if you forget that you have left the machine ON, it will switch OFF automatically after running for 4 minutes.


What We Need & What You Get 
We now seek your help. Whatever money we
could, we have invested in the engineering and mold development. We now have a
fully tested machine ready to be mass produced. In order to mass produce it and
keep the price low for the poor people of India and other parts of the world to
buy, we need to make them in a certain quantity.
Millions of families in
India & elsewhere still can’t afford the regular washing machines. Additionally,
while many can, they do not have sufficient place to keep the bulky machines in
their 1 room homes. Millions do not have running water connection in their
homes to use the traditional washing machines. These people are forced to wash
their clothes manually which is not only physically taxing, but also time
consuming. Manual washing also consumes more water…a fast depleting commodity
worldwide!!!
For all
these people, the VENUS, is the alternative.









We
are fortunate to be living in proper homes with proper amenities and
appliances. However, millions across the world are not as fortunate. We plan to
mass produce this machine at a very low cost so that it is affordable to the
poorest of the poor all over the world.
If we can do this, we will consider having done something for the needy brethren. By
contributing to our endeavor, you too can do your bit…
If
this campaign is successful, we will send these machines to the poor families
in other Third World countries also in addition to making them available to
poor families here in India at a very low price.
The Impact
 Women in poor families wash clothes by hand. To do this, they have to squat on the floor and rub the clothes vigorously. This develops into back, shoulder & hip pain over a period of time in most such women. Also prolonged exposure to chemicals in detergents lead to skin rashes and diseases on their hands.


VENUS will help prevent this to a large extent. Your small contribution will help millions of suffering women and prevent this from happening to the future generations of women. Also this will save women time to do extra work and most importantly save enormous amount of precious water since manual cleaning results in more water usage than what is actually required. Please see the testimonial below;



Sujata is a maid who lives with her 2 children in a single room shanty
in suburban Mumbai. She earns her livelihood by doing housework in residential
apartments near her home. We gave her one VENUS to use and she has been using
it for over 3 months now. 
This is what she has to
say “Earlier washing my
husband’s, my kids’ and my own clothes used to take me almost an hour. Now I do
it in less than 20/25 minutes. This extra time has allowed me to work in an extra
home and increase my income. Also now I do not feel any burden in washing
clothes. I used to be very tired after scrubbing clothes in the past. Before
using this machine, I required almost 5 buckets of water to wash the clothes.
Now I am able to do it in just 3 buckets of water. This is perhaps the biggest
advantage as we do not have water connection in our shanties and I have to
bring water from a distant municipal tap early morning everyday after standing
in a queue. All my neighbors are now asking for this machine & keep borrowing it from me.”
STORY BEHIND THIS PRODUCT
8 years ago my late mother had brain surgery and was
rendered paralyzed and bed ridden. During this time, one of the biggest
challenges we faced was washing her soiled bed sheets and clothes. Washing them
in the regular washing machine was neither advisable nor hygienic and the
bathroom had to be cleaned thoroughly after they were washed in there.
It
is then, when I thought of a portable washing machine that can do the same work
as a regular machine and yet be easy to clean. With the help of an engineer
friend and an old photo from the internet we came up with the idea of a PORTABLE
washing machine that can be mounted on any bucket for easy use. This solved all
our problems. The mess washed in the
bucket was easy to dispose off and the bucket easily cleaned without fear of
contamination.
Needless
to say that what I used during my mom’s time was a very crude prototype. Since
then, I have had several friends and relatives ask me for such a washing
machine. Encouraged by this, we carried out a small survey to ascertain whether
there is a market for such a product. We found out that there is indeed a
demand. Honestly, we were not surprised since such a device has several
advantages and makes sense to use in some very practical yet compelling
situations as described above.
So
we set out to make a proper PORTABLE , MINI & MOBILE WASHING MACHINE.
Since I had already used the initial prototype for a considerable period of
time, we had the necessary practical experience to make the necessary changes
and perfect the design. We drew inspiration from a very old design we saw photo of on the internet and used it as the base to develop our product keeping in mind that it should be compact, light weight and easy to use in any condition. 
The result is VENUS, the machine you saw in the video.
IMPORTANT:
We don't claim to be the inventor of this design. We have re-modeled a very old design which was inefficient, power consuming big and bulky (it was designed to work with a drum) and developed it into a compact, energy efficient light weight working model that can be mounted on a bucket as small as 15 liters and as big as 25 liters. Also the super insulating feature is absolutely new and all Venus will be shipped with this. Venus is a completely re-engineered, absolutely safe device.
Vimbas Navrachna has been formed to bring to market socially responsible products.
Products that have great utility for the general public and especially benefit
the poor.
The group that works for Vimbas is highly
driven to contribute back to the society. It is this determination that
inspired us to develop VENUS – THE MINI PORTABLE WASHING MACHINE for the
poor people. My deceased mother used to say, it is better to make money - but it's better to make it by doing something that benefits the underprivileged...This is my first step towards this goal. I seek partners like you.
Guided by this philosophy, we have selected
few other socially relevant projects for the future. However, it will be
premature to talk about them at this stage. Our priority right now is to make
VENUS a success. 



Risks & Challenges
 
Selection
of motor was the most challenging aspect of this product design. Since we
wanted to mount the device on a plastic bucket, the overall weight of the
device was of prime concern. We had to ensure that we can wash maximum possible
load with a powerful, yet light enough motor so that the device weight does not
become unbearable for the plastic bucket. 
Since we are using 110/220 volts of alternating current to power the device, we were aware of the natural fear of electric shock that people have. Extra care has been taken to ensure that under no circumstance can there be a danger of electrical shock. The motor and electrical points have been sprayed with a special chemical imported from Russia. This super insulating coating makes all electrical devices WATERPROOF - even when live current is on.

Most importantly, unlike others, we are not seeking funds to develop a product. We already have done all the required R&D and have a tried & tested product on hand. This automatically lowers the risk involved significantly.
RAW MATERIALS AVAILABILITY AND SUPPLY
While
robust marketing is essential to keep sales going, it is equally important to
maintain an uninterrupted supply of all required components. With over 20 years
of experience in production and sales, our team is fully knowledgeable and
capable to handle any situation and yet ensure that the production lines are
never short of parts. We have developed relations with multiple vendors and
this will be our backup should any one vendor fail. The device body is
injection molded and this work is done by a vendor with whom we have working
relationship for the last 10 years.

Post Funding
VENUS
is tried, tested and is now ready for production. We have identified the
factory with necessary equipment, machines & manpower to make these unique machines. Accordingly, funds will be used to pay the factory and purchase
required raw materials to build inventory. If we fail to reach our goal, we
will try and self fund the remainder amount. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ALL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE THEIR PERKS - REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING OUTCOME. 
Availability
We
plan to commence shipment of VENUS in February 2015, if all goes as per
schedule.

ICUmini sets up super fast and can move from room to room easily.
With our intuitive App keep tabs wherever you go right on your smartphone!  Keep intruders out, a watchful eye on your nanny and kids ... plus so much more!  
Place it anywhere you want
ICUmini is battery-powered and completely wire-free, so our devices are simple to place,  position and move within any environment. Create a system that covers  your entryways and windows, monitors the garage, or keeps a watchful eye  over the kids' rooms. Best of all, the ultra small size of the cameras mean that your nanny, thief or intruder will never know they are being watched!
Instant verification
ICUmini has been designed to make your peace of mind easy and  accessible. As soon a motion is detected, video starts recording and an  alert is sent to your smartphone or tablet, so you can see exactly what  caused the alert and decide how to react. 
Not only will the cameras go undetected, they are connected with the Sync Station, letting you view the feeds live wherever you are, whenever you want.
Ultra-affordable and easy to expand
Our main goal is to help protect your home and your wallet: ICUmini starts  at just $45 and there are no monthly fees, Its unique design makes it easy  to create and expand a system that’s just right for your apartment, home  or business, for a fraction of the cost of other home monitoring  devices. Currently ICUmini allows up to eight cameras connections and we are working hard to build a new sync station with up to 24 connections.
Setting up the ICUMini takes as little as 5 minutes and you can set the cameras and station literally anywhere in your home or office. It could be in the kitchen, children’s rooms, office, garage or even a walk-in closet.As seen on:GadgetifyiPhonenessTrendHunterThe ICUmini Starter PacksICUmini Starter Set 1 - includes a ICUmini Clock, model ""Santa Ana"" or model ""Zapote"" with integrated camera, the ICUmini remote control  and the ICUmini sync station.ICUmini Starter Set 2 - includes a ICUmini Picture Frame (10"") with integrated camera and Image Rotation, the ICUmini remote control and the ICUmini sync station.ICUmini Starter Set 3 - includes a ICUmini Clock, model ""Escazu"" or model ""Sabana"" with

ICUMini Picture Frame
Regular camera systems not only take up space, they look downright bad. With ICUMini, we aim to change that! With an integrated picture slideshow available in each ICUMini Picture Frame, not only do you protect your home using less space, but that space houses a work of art. So, not only do our cameras protect your home, they look great while doing so.Don’t want our pictures? Upload your own family pictures, vacation spots or your favorite work of art – the possibilities are endless! Picture frames are available at 10"", 14"", 17"", 21"", 32”, 42” and 50” and while a picture frame looks great, a monitor looks better! With HDMI connections on the 32”, 42” and 50” frames, you can connect your 
computer, gaming console or receiver with the frame and use it as an HD 
LED display. The best thing is that the camera is so small, nobody will 
ever notice it.Please note that the 32”, 42” and 50” Picture Frames require 110/220V,  they are NOT completely wire-free :-(Tech specsICUmini features

<h3>So, What is a Pillar Boat?</h3>A Pillar Boat is a self propelled wave isolated floating platform.  Instead of having a conventional hull, it is supported on sets of spar buoys attached to swivel footings which support the main platform.  Figure 1. shows the simplest version of a Pillar Boat, the non transitioning 3X3 configuration.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442268428/p3gggcpjk7kfrq9vktll.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Pillar Boats get their support from deep below the waves and have a naturally deep draft.  This makes them fairly slow, but their purpose is not speed, it is to support large masses safely and smoothly above the waves.  Rather than fight the waves as traditional surface ships do, the Pillar Boat allows them to wash harmlessly underneath.  Also traditional surface vessels must face into the approaching waves and are vulnerable to waves from the side.  The Pillar Boat has no bow or stern and can handle waves from any direction.<br/></p>
<p>The deep draft makes it hard to navigate in and out of port, that is why the buoy transitioning system was developed.  For additional buoyancy, and redundancy for increased safety, five floats per cluster were also incorporated into the basic design.</p>
<p>Figure 2. shows a self propelled, 5X3, transitioning Pillar Boat.  This campaign is intended to generate funds for the design and construction of a scale prototype of the model shown below. <br/></p>

    The Impact of Pillar Boats
 Pillar Boats will change the world.  Just like the Space Needle, once debuted, every city in the world (with ocean access) will have to have one.  Pillar Boats will allow land locked countries to expand to the sea, opening new business and leisure destinations. Pillar Boats will open ocean exploration, enable new sea life research, and allow for greater stewardship of the world's oceans. Dare to dream big!  A Pillar Boat can be a place to be free.  Hey Disney Corp! How about building a Tomorrow Land park on one of these in the Gulf of Mexico?

Furthermore the Zwobbx modul can interact with REST-Services and provides support for Wi-Fi Direct, WPS, legacy Wi-Fi Client, SoftAP modes and HTTPS/SSL. As a result you can stuff all gathered data in your own application, home server, our tools or whatever you like to use.</p><p><b>Which of my data gets the Zwobbx company?</b></p><p>We just need the common informations which are necessary to transact a trade. Besides this you have the full control about your data privacy.</p><p>
</p><p>Choose whether you want to:</p>
<p>- isolate all monitored informations in your home network.</p>
<p>- get messages by the Zwobbx server about your home status (only
intrusions or other alarm signals etc. without sending specific home data to
our server).</p><p>

What we want is to combine all useful home observation, automation and security features together and connect all of them with your Wi-Fi  - easy to handle for you with your phone, tablet or PC. Our low power battery driven Wi-Fi module connects directly to your existing network. Furthermore Zwobbx can interact with established systems through our special gateway. Many other solutions work with one or two operations and need a main base station. We were wondering why they do this? For this reason we like to offer with Zwobbx comfortable a bunch of operations just by using your existing Wi-Fi.Future upgrades for the Zwobbx systemThese are only a few situations where Zwobbx can help you to make your day easier. Even if you don't own a house or garden you have the opportunity to keep an eye on everything that is important to you.About the peopleChristopher Brauer:Age: 24Industrial ManagerSpecialist field: Project coordination Christian Hänsch:Age: 46Master of EngineeringSpecialist field: Hard- and Software developmentReferences:Deutsche BörseVodafonSAPMercedes-BenzMicrosoftRobert Frischbier:Age: 34Business EconomistSpecialist field: Security and business development Works in the private security sectorWhat´s next?
Zwobbx will become the home automation all-purpose tool. The next functions to be integrated in the Wi-Fi based system will be:
-  Weather station
-  Fungus prevention for walls (air humidity sensor)
- 
TV-simulation
-  Integrated Neighbourhouse
wake-up
- 
Radar
sensor for motion detection in addition to the infrared sensor
- 
Smart
metering – measure your energie consumption
-  Child watch: e.g.
Did
the children come home after school?-  Air quality and smoke detectionDepending on the progress of the campaign, we will implement additional functions already to the first devices.ShippingThe shipping is free for all countries.
FAQIs this the final case design?It is a possible design and very dependent on the type of sensors which are included. Some sensors need special case requirements.How long is battery lifetime?The Zwobbx module based on an ultra-low power, Wi-Fi chip. Battery lifetime: approx. 6 month, depends on TX-Rate, temperature and so on.Is there a alternative to batteries?We will offer an AC/DC-adapter to power up the Zwobbx module.How open is the system for the end user?We provide an API for customized applications. Furthermore the Zwobbx modul can interact with REST-Services and provides support for Wi-Fi Direct, WPS, legacy Wi-Fi Client, SoftAP modes and HTTPS/SSL. As a result you can stuff all gathered data in your own application, home server, our tools or whatever you like to use.Which of my data gets the Zwobbx company?We just need the common informations which are necessary to transact a trade. Besides this you have the full control about your data privacy.
Choose whether you want to:
- isolate all monitored informations in your home network.
- get messages by the Zwobbx server about your home status (only
intrusions or other alarm signals etc. without sending specific home data to
our server).

- use the full potential of your protective shield and
connect with us and other user to spot criminal movements in your city,
district or even the street.What kind of support service is offered?Until now we prefer a full online support.Which languages will you provide for manuals, App, support service etc.?As things are now we would start with English and German. According to circumstances we will successively add more.Which operating systems support our app?We want to provide our application for Android, iOS and Windows Phone.
Thank you for supporting us

<strong>Simple and Independent </strong><strong>Wireless Control</strong>
</h2>
<p>Every iLumi has advanced Bluetooth technology <strong>built inside the bulb</strong>. You don’t have to worry about connecting to routers, master/slave dependency, or other complications and headaches. Each iLumi has up to a 100 foot range, and multiple iLumis can communicate with one another to pass on commands and work together, creating a reliable Bluetooth mesh network.  Technically speaking, each iLumi uses dual-mode Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth 4.0) wireless technology that is low-power, secure, scalable, and supports almost every mobile device.</p>
<p>This gives you complete control over how and where you use your iLumi bulbs. Control a whole house of iLumis, control a room, or control just one. Take your iLumis to a friend’s house. For professionals, like gaffers, photographers, or event lighting specialists, take your iLumis with you on location to create amazing effects with the touch of a button. Plus it’s great for commercial locations like bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.</p>

<h2>
<strong style=""font-size: 30px;"">Limitless Programming Options</strong><br/>
</h2>
<p>Along with Bluetooth, each iLumi is equipped with computing technology, including a processor, memory, and real-time clock for endless programming possibilities. Here’s an idea of what’s possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Set your lighting to fit your schedule –</strong> Slowly turn on your lights with your alarm in the morning, set your lights to dim or brighten as the sun rises and sets, or have your lights slowly turn off when it’s time for bed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set your lighting to recognize when you’re there</strong> – iLumis can sense your location and proximity, turning off when you leave, turning on when you come back, or even automatically lighting your path as you move around the house.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lighting for information at a glance</strong> – Receive text, social media, and phone call alerts, get an idea for the day’s weather, or keep up to date with stock price movements and news alerts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create and save scenes for perfect personalized lighting</strong> – About to watch a movie? Impress a date? Or just head off to bed?  One tap on saved scenes and your lights create the perfect mood.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create dynamic atmospheres </strong>– Have your lighting synchronize to music, mimic an underwater world of rolling blue waves, or create amazing effects like light strobes, fire, candlelight, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>The sky is the limit</strong><em> – </em>We plan to release a software development kit (SDK) so anyone can come up with innovative new ways to use iLumis.  Receive SDK first in a Light Hacker Kit perk level.</li>

<h2><strong>Set-up Made Simple</strong></h2>
<p>We want you to have an amazing experience from day one, so we’ve simplified the set-up process to these two easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screw in one or multiple iLumis</li>
<li>Download the app</li>
</ol>
<p>After iLumis receive power for the first time, they automatically find and pair with the open iLumi app and create a secured authentication for that mobile device. You can always share access with family and friends who download the iLumi app on their own devices. There are no boxes, routers, master-slave configurations or dependencies -- it just works that simply.</p>
<p>Plus you can always use an old fashioned light switch to turn your iLumis off and on to a personalized default setting.</p>
<p><img alt=""Easy Install"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/545502/pictures/full/20121119103857-Installation_graphic_soft.jpg?1353350340"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h2><strong>Leading Energy Efficiency and Savings</strong></h2>
<p>Home lighting comprises about 25% of your electric usage every month, so it pays to practice energy efficiency. By combining our advanced HyperLux LED technology’s efficiency with programming and automation functionality, iLumi is the most energy efficient light bulb in its class. And every iLumi lasts up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Every iLumi more than pays for itself multiple times over through the course of its life. Considering energy savings and replacement offset, comparing the large 15 watt iLumi to a 100 watt incandescent you can save about $340. Comparing the small 8 watt iLumi to a 60 watt incandescent you can save about $200.</p>
<p><img alt=""Energy Savings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/545580/pictures/full/20121119112941-energy-savings_final.jpg?1353353386"" src="""" style=""""/><em>Savings reflect Large iLumi compared to 100 watt incandescent over 20 years</em></p>
<h2><strong>The iLumi App</strong></h2>
<p>Behind iLumi is the iLumi app, which will be available as a free download in the App Store or Google Play. We’ve designed the iLumi app to be simple, rich, intuitive, and engaging.</p>
<p>The app is compatible with all Android phones and tablets, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 3 (Retina Display), and iPad mini. When you set up your iLumis, it creates a secure authentication between the app and each light (so no practical jokes from the neighbors). The app is easily scalable to accommodate one or up to 100 iLumis, and comes loaded with a multitude of programs and the ability to schedule commands – well beyond simple color control settings.</p>

<h3>Who are we and what are we doing?</h3>
</div>
<div>Full Moon Cheesecakes creates and delivers high-quality cheesecakes within Guadalpe, Comal, Bexar, and Kendall counties (ok... we cheat and go outside of those sometimes) in Texas.  Wherever possible, we source our ingredients from (in order) local, state, American, small business, then corporate.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Additionally, Full Moon Cheesecakes has been a regular at the New Braunfels farmer's market for some time.  We've found the community to be extremely receptive to what we do, and now we'd like to set up shop in New Braunfels or Gruene to become more convenient and responsive to our customers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We wish to set up a cozy family-friendly haven for folks to enjoy our cheesecakes and Hawaiian coffees.  This campaign is to fund the larger equipment items we will need for this shop.  Foodies in New Braunfels value the seemingly polar opposites of rustic and cosmopolitan with a little ""weirdness"" for good measure - that's precisely what  we're aiming to provide!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To our existing customers:  YES we intend to keep delivering to where you need it, and coming to the New Braunfels Farmer's Market!</div>

</div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; Our Perks</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>What we need:</p>
<p>Total goal for this campaign is $15,000 for equipment including the following</p>
<ul>
<li style="""">
<ul>
<li>Commercial Convection Oven</li>
<li>Several Fridges and Refrigerated Display Cases</li>
<li>Several Prep Tables</li>
<li>Coffee Roaster</li>
<li>Two Food Processors and several sets of Blades and Bowls</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We do NOT expect $15k to cover everything we will eventually need for this business; but if we can get these items, they will help generate revenue for the actual building lease and the small stuff - both of which we will sweat.</p>
In addition to our perks:</div>
<div> </div>
<ul>
<li><strong>NO MATTER IF WE MAKE OUR GOAL OR NOT - we will donate 10% of all funds received to the Spirit of Sharing (SOS) Food Bank in New Braunfels.  We contemplated donating cheesecakes, but SOS better knows the food needs of the local community - we'll let them make the call.  After that donation, we will use any collected funds to purchase what we can of the equipment above.</strong></li>
</ul><div> </div>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALL contributors - regardless of amount - will be listed (unless you request otherwise) as a ""founder"" on our website.  We will also list your name on our ""Founder's Wall"" in-shop.</strong></li>
</ul><div>
<h3>You said you'd love to:</h3>
<p>When the equipment's funded and the shop's open, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a friend or two and comfortably enjoy coffee and cheesecake!</li>
<li>Experience no/lower lead time between order and delivery!</li>
<li>Drop by after work and pick up just the right cheesecake for the family!</li>
<li>Drop by DURING work and pick up fresh team treats!</li>
<li>Stop by for a sample just to see which of our flavors is the perfect one for your party or gathering</li>
<li>ORDER FOR DELIVERY TO AUSTIN!!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have been renting a commercial kitchen for the past year - while that's been a fantastic incubator for our business, it keeps our costs and prices high (no volume ingredient buying) and limits the fun and creative things we want to do!</p>
<p>We've also never been able to support our customers who visit from Austin - if we get this shop open, we can!</p>
<p>We've been selling and delivering to retail customers now for a year - and you've told us you love what we do for you!  But we _have_ heard what else you want, and this is our opportunity to make it happen!</p>

<strong>INTRODUCING THE </strong><strong>CAT WALK</strong>
</h3><p>Like all ViviPet products, our newest product is packed full of features, meticulously designed and engineered. This is a minimalist design that is not only stylish, it is also a unique playground for your cats. It's perfect for apartments and compact spaces with unlimited configurations of the Cat Walks. The Cat Walk's unlimited configurations is perfect for apartments and small spaces.</p><p>The idea of the Cat Walk came to us when we visited Peter Cohen's House of Nekko. We came to realize that cats are a part of our life; they aren't only here to comfort us -- they live with us. Why not build a place for them?</p><p>To maximize the living comfort for both human and cats, we need to utilize the space above our heads and on the walls for the cats. With this structure, the cats are able to jump around and enhance their health and agility. Now, they use the spaces that we never use such as the doorway, wall corners, and many more. With the help of Peter Cohen, Founder of ZenByCat, we are able to bring this idea to life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499282864/jmbcd8hrtsptjardjdst.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT MAKES THE CAT WALK SO AMAZING?</h3><p>The high-quality materials used in the Cat Walk is great for both human and cat use. We can proudly say that this is a one of a kind floating wall shelf and nothing on the market comes close.

We cannot wait to get these Cat Walks in your hands.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES This is ViviPet’s first Kickstarter project. We've been in business for several years now and we have not disappointed anyone with our products (hopefully stays this way!) We are a growing company that has an amazing team behind us to care for our products and our customers.In short, we are a pet lover company -- we know what we do best, to intertwine the health benefit, functionality with amazing design that one would mistakenly for a human product.Supply Chain Risk: We have been working with a manufacture since we started the company, and both parties instantly connected and know exactly what each other want. They are very fast in delivering our orders. However, sometimes things happen and it's out of our control. Sometimes shipping containers of the products get stuck in the custom for longer than expected.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I attended Denstone College where i took seven G.C.S.E's and an A'level in art and design. It was from my designing interest that i brought this idea to fruition.</p>
<p>Although my employment back ground does not really contribute to the concept of this table lamp i guess you could assume from it that i work best when left to my own devices. Before this i was a test driver for J.C.B and the bar manager for a popular hotel. Both requiring long hours and a word which has proven to be key in my adult life. Preparation.</p>
<p>This leads me perfectly into the next point, about my lamp. I had to do a lot of preparation in initializing my grand plan. I first had the patents to contend with which took alot of time and effort and then there was the dreaded sourcing of the manufacturer. After several expensive and very poor quality samples i finally settled upon a great company who have agreed to make it and even sell some for me themselves, for a commission of course.</p>
<p>I just feel that this lamp will benefit all of its users as you can simply and effectively angle the light to wherever it is wished and there is the added feature of the colour changing ability by adding or removing the transparent coloured slides that slip easily down grooves on each side of each ""side"". So if you choose to you can mix and match the colours.</p>
<p>The lamp is also LED so it wont't need to be upgraded anytime soon which has to be a positive as the normal (cfl) bulbs as you are probably aware are being phased out.</p>
<p>Your assistence will be of paramount importance as i have done everything i can. I have now hit the proverbial brick wall and can do no more until i pay for manufacture.</p>

<p>1) It will decrease the electricity bills as the need for a main light will be a thing of the past as you just adjust the blinds to wherever you need the light to be.</p>
<p>2) The end user will be able to cater for their mood by inserting the relevant colour for there current state of mind.</p>
<p>3) It will most definately negate the need to arrange the room accordingly to cater for this light source or even trying to find some where to plug it in will be a thing of the past as no matter where it is placed a simple adjustment will ensure you receive the light.</p>

You can also notice the grooves. They hold a piece of transparent coloured plastic that emitts a different coloured light. Possibly one to suit the mood that you have at that time. They are very easy to change simply slide one out and insert another.<p>   The available colours of this lamp will be able to comfortably blend in with any room colour scheme. It will act as the perfect accent light.</p>

Before this i was a test driver for J.C.B and the bar manager for a popular hotel. Both requiring long hours and a word which has proven to be key in my adult life. Preparation.
This leads me perfectly into the next point, about my lamp. I had to do a lot of preparation in initializing my grand plan. I first had the patents to contend with which took alot of time and effort and then there was the dreaded sourcing of the manufacturer. After several expensive and very poor quality samples i finally settled upon a great company who have agreed to make it and even sell some for me themselves, for a commission of course.
I just feel that this lamp will benefit all of its users as you can simply and effectively angle the light to wherever it is wished and there is the added feature of the colour changing ability by adding or removing the transparent coloured slides that slip easily down grooves on each side of each ""side"". So if you choose to you can mix and match the colours.
The lamp is also LED so it wont't need to be upgraded anytime soon which has to be a positive as the normal (cfl) bulbs as you are probably aware are being phased out.
Your assistence will be of paramount importance as i have done everything i can. I have now hit the proverbial brick wall and can do no more until i pay for manufacture.
 

Please, if for whatever reason you just cant contribute, even after reading this then could you please share instead as the more people who see my campaign the greater my chances of success
 
Please donate to my campaign.
 It would be so amazing of you all and would be greatly appreciated.
please look at stylish lamp suppliers
This lamp fundamentaly will be of great benefit to the end user for a number of reasons.
1) It will decrease the electricity bills as the need for a main light will be a thing of the past as you just adjust the blinds to wherever you need the light to be.
2) The end user will be able to cater for their mood by inserting the relevant colour for there current state of mind.
3) It will most definately negate the need to arrange the room accordingly to cater for this light source or even trying to find some where to plug it in will be a thing of the past as no matter where it is placed a simple adjustment will ensure you receive the light.
 

  A discretely placed little ""wheel"" on the inside that turns to operate the shutters. ( As shown above.)   (yellow inserts.)These are located on each of the four sides. You can also notice the grooves. They hold a piece of transparent coloured plastic that emitts a different coloured light. Possibly one to suit the mood that you have at that time. They are very easy to change simply slide one out and insert another.   The available colours of this lamp will be able to comfortably blend in with any room colour scheme. It will act as the perfect accent light.
   This lamp is a very practical light source as it will light your room EVERYWHERE and is much cheaper to use than having a bright impersonal main fixture on.
                                                   They are on sale for a very
                                                        Reasonable price of
                                                                 $74.99

I am disabled all from as slip in the garden which means i can't work so therefore cannot save any money to pay for it myself ! I did take it under strong advice not to mention that but i do now feel that it will somewhat strengthen my campaign.

<h3>Easy2LED project</h3>
<p>The Easy2LED project (<a href=""http://www.easy2led.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.easy2led.com</a>) was launched to help DIY enthusiasts in making custom LED lights. The most difficult part in a DIY LED light is the metal housing, so we so we focused on making housings where you can install your favourite LED, optic and driver.</p>
The first project was designed for 20mm optics and it proved to be a success. Now we are in the process of making a larger housing for 35mm optics.
<p>The new housing will be easier to assemble, waterproof and reusable.</p>
<p>The project is under way but we need funding to pay for manufacturing and assembly on a larger scale in order to lower the unit cost.</p>
<h3>Product</h3>
<p>The new housing will feature improvements over the previous model but unfortunately those improvements are costly, that is why we started this campaign. More information on the product is below.</p>
<h3>Funds</h3>
<p>We have paid the tooling costs and made prepayments for some of the parts.</p>
<p>The collected funds will be used to pay for part of the manufacturing and assembly costs and if the funding goal is reached, we will be able to make a spare rear cover for each kit.</p>
<h3>What you get in return</h3>
<p>Each backer will receive a complete kit for making your own rugged LED light.</p>
<p>The kit contains:</p>
<p>1 aliminium shell, anodized black</p>
<p>1 aluminium pill for the LED board and driver</p>
<p>1 multilayer coated glass with retainer ring</p>
<p>1 rear cover (2 if the funding goal is reached)</p>

<p>I live in historic Keeler, Ca, a profoundly quiet place now, born of mining and wed to the railroad. The current population of about 50 hold on at the edge of storied Owens Drybed Lake, with majestic surroundings of Death Valley to the east and Mt. Whitney westward.</p>
<p>I noticed the old pool site was declining. Keeler has been described as a living ghost town (it is a wisp of its former population of 2-3,000 people), but there are a number of significant historic sites remaining. One is the old pool, built by a hardy community in the 1920s, luring Hollywood stars to cool off in the hot desert after filming,  holding county events, and serving as a playground for generations of families.</p>
<p>Even after it closed, photographers, painters, nature lovers and historians remained intrigued, and its little buildings are much loved in their setting. I didn't realize how much it meant to me until the prospect of its destruction loomed before me. (The substantial ghost town of Aurora was dismantled one brick at a time, until nothing of it remains. ) We don't want that to happen to Keeler. </p>
<p>So, people here got together and formed K.E.E.P.S. Keeler Early Era Preservation Society (to become a non-profit) and entered into negotiations with the private owner, who is inclined toward community restoration.  He is in favor of our  endeavors, which have evolved as we discussed plans.</p>
<p>Maintaining a chlorinated, almost olympic-sized pool for 50 residents seemed like a luxury unbecoming to our era. So we are planning a natural pool (like the example in Ibiza, Spain at the Agroturismo Can Marti <a href=""http://www.greentraveler.uk.co/blogs/hotels-natural-swimming-pools.)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.greentraveler.uk.co/blogs/hotels-natural-swimming-pools.)</a> Half the area is plantable.</p>

The journey from “Lab to Fab” is always the
trickiest period in the product development. We’ve worked very hard on the

<b></b><p><b>“Have you ever asked yourself WHY does light have to
be in a</b><b> shape of an ordinary bulb, neon light or a LED?</b>”<b>
</b><br/></p>
<p>We actually asked ourselves <i>the same question</i> and it finally dawned on us… why does light have
to be contained in such small objects? Why can’t a whole WALL emit beautiful
light? </p>
<p><b>That’s when we had our “AHA!” moment and the birth
of Lightning Wallpaper was born.</b><b><b>
<b>The Power of
Electroluminescent Lighting Revealed…</b>
</b>”</b><br/></p>
</div>
<p>When
we first met <b>Electroluminescent
Technology</b> (a form of printed light), we were simply <i>astonished</i> how FLAT and COOL that light can be. We knew at that
point it was up to us to create a simple flat form of this light in the form of
an <b>easy-to-apply tile system</b> that
could be used to cover <u>entire walls</u>. </p>
We
decided to invest into the first working prototype based on the first <b>FLOWERS &amp; </b><p><b>CIRCLES</b> artwork, which
has the honor to be presented this week on most prestigious design event in
Prague, Czech Republic

<i>Lighting Wallpaper will bring true ambient beauty

<p>And
now the final product of Lightning Wallpaper is something, after a lot of hard
work, design and more, has become something so beautiful that we know it’ll be
the next “must have” lighting system for anyone who has an interest in
“non-traditional” interior design. Lightning
Wallpaper can transform just about any room including: living rooms, working
areas, entertainment rooms, hotel lobbies or reception rooms, night clubs,
bars, spas, dance floors…and the list goes on and on!

<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges
<b>We’re
Now Facing…</b>
<br/>
</h3>
<p>1.)
<b>If we don't reach our goal, the start of
our business will be slower than planned.</b> We will however proceed step by
step according to our original plan, but in a slower, more low-cost way (not so
many designs, etc.). We’ll continue in negotiations with individual investors,
who are interested to support this project directly, to raise the needed
amount.<br/></p>
<p>2.) <b>Technological Issues.</b> The tiles
themselves are based on proven (10 years production and function experience)
and known technology. “New” is only the usage (form of individual tiles
combined into bigger units) and system of connection. This system already
exists in the form of a prototype but the final stage of development will be
financed by this campaign and will be done in cooperation with specialists form
ELON Technologies, who have long-term experience with this technology (outdoor
ELON Posters). We already have an exact idea how to do it!</p>
<p>3.)
<b>Low Interest in the Market.</b> First
reactions of designers and architects to whom we have already introduced the
product to have been nothing short of very intense interest. They expressed only two main risks:
</p>
<p>A.) <b>Too High
of Price.</b> Being a technology product with sophisticated manufacturing process, the price $500 USD is comparable with price of luxury paper or textiles wallpapers. You have a chance to get ordered or pre-ordered this product by 20% less, now. It is also comparable with
current analogical technologies (LED boxes) but with much more comfort for
users (flexibility, weight, size, etc.) There’s already quite an abundant
market for Lightning Wallpaper even at current price, but
when the market EXPLODE the price will go even lower  most likely . </p>B.) <b>Complicated Installation.</b>
Lighting Wallpaper is very easy to install. All you need comes in the box. You
start with planning the order of the tiles, then all you have to do is simply
stick ""CONNECTIONS"" on the surface where you want your Lighting
Wallpaper. When you have your connections on you simply add tiles and connect. <br/><p>

</div></div>","“Get Ready To
Make Your Walls Come Alive With Beautiful Light and Patterns To Simply Transform The Atmosphere of
Any Room!”
 This Ultra-Slim Decorative Element Can Be Quickly
Added To Any Room, Office or Designed Interior and Bring It To Life!Introducing The World’s First Wallpaper Emitting Light!
Let The Walls Come To Life
With Ambient Light & Design!


The journey from “Lab to Fab” is always the
trickiest period in the product development. We’ve worked very hard on the
final solution for Lighting Wallpaper and now we are ready to bring it to the world!
We’re truly excited to launch the first prototype directly to you! 






“Have you ever asked yourself WHY does light have to
be in a shape of an ordinary bulb, neon light or a LED?”

We actually asked ourselves the same question and it finally dawned on us… why does light have
to be contained in such small objects? Why can’t a whole WALL emit beautiful
light? 
That’s when we had our “AHA!” moment and the birth
of Lightning Wallpaper was born.
The Power of
Electroluminescent Lighting Revealed…
”

When
we first met Electroluminescent
Technology (a form of printed light), we were simply astonished how FLAT and COOL that light can be. We knew at that
point it was up to us to create a simple flat form of this light in the form of
an easy-to-apply tile system that
could be used to cover entire walls. 
We
decided to invest into the first working prototype based on the first FLOWERS & CIRCLES artwork, which
has the honor to be presented this week on most prestigious design event in
Prague, Czech Republic 
 - Designblok 2014



Lighting Wallpaper at Prague's Designblok show, 7th October 2014




Lighting Wallpaper will bring true ambient beauty
and atmosphere to any room! 
And
now the final product of Lightning Wallpaper is something, after a lot of hard
work, design and more, has become something so beautiful that we know it’ll be
the next “must have” lighting system for anyone who has an interest in
“non-traditional” interior design. Lightning
Wallpaper can transform just about any room including: living rooms, working
areas, entertainment rooms, hotel lobbies or reception rooms, night clubs,
bars, spas, dance floors…and the list goes on and on!


.We’re Just A Few Steps Away From Our Ultimate Goal… 


In
order for our unique Lightning Wallpaper to get off the ground and into regular
production, we need YOUR help and contribution to make sure it can happen. Now
is your chance to help us launch the “next big thing” in future lighting. 
Why not join
us to help “light up” the future?
Tony & Mark
Lighting
Wallpaper was developed using the experience from ELON Technologies with the
aim to use the electroluminescent technology on commercial applications where
the light is required to be absolutely flat. 
This
printed light method secures the best
lighting performance while printed in relatively smaller sizes, therefore
the designers come up with a tile system: ""How to apply the Lighting Wallpaper on a wall"". 


The basic tile size has been set up on 50 x 50 cm
with a different size of 
lighting area depending on the wallpaper artwork.



What We Need & What You’ll Get…

goal of $56,000
US dollars, has the aim to collect basic funding for further

One that allows you to save up to 1 thousand euros on coffee per year for a family of four. But, most importantly, one that puts you back at the center, allowing you to use mostly any grind and kind of coffee available on the market, whether it’s from your favourite brand or your local coffee shop.        Last year you helped us make WayCap a reality. Today we’re back to introduce the result of all the hard work developed thanks to your precious feedback: WayCap Ez.    Waycap Ez widens the grind range to almost any kind of coffee on the market. Here’s why we’re equipping WayCap Ez with 3 different interchangeable tops, each targeted to a particular kind of coffee grind. The thinner the grind, the bigger amount of slots you should use, and vice versa. By switching them you will easily find the one that best suits your tastes.         With the extra tops you’ll complete your Barista Set. The kit includes 5 extra tops, in addition to the 3 already supplied, to be as precise as you can when you make your espresso. You can choose the Basic Kit Barista (1 WayCap Ez, 1 manual dispenser and 8 tops) or you can add the set to your order through the button at the bottom of the following picture.
 

 Thanks to you, we’ve also changed the way the capsule opens and closes, to make refilling it even easier and faster. You now simply snap the top, and unsnap it. Each WayCap is produced entirely in Italy, in timeless stainless steel, and just a bit of FDA compliant high quality silicon in the new external ring, that makes WayCap Ez even more compatible.      Since WayCap Ez works with mostly any bland on the market, the savings can be up to 85% compared to the disposable capsules. A family of 4 can save up to 1000 Euros per year.  WayCap capsules are made of stainless steel. They're designed to last and to be refillable, so they can be reused as many times as you’d like. They don’t produce any waste except for the coffee grounds and their environmental impact is minimal in every stage of production. Now you can finally kiss goodbye to the millions of disposable pods that accumulate in landfills Every part of the pod, including the seals, is manufactured in the immediate vicinity of the warehouse and makes only one trip before arriving at your home.WayCap can be refilled in 20 seconds, just enough time for the machine to warm up, using the manual dispenser, that leaves no trace. The manual dispenser can store up to two caps that you can bring with you anywhere you go, for example at office.   

Make your WayCap experience complete with the new Ruvidock, the support made by WayCap that holds up to 2 capsules and 1 manual dispenser. Ruvidock includes Scovolino, the stainless steel cleaning stick to easily clean the capsule right after use.

 
You can also enjoy your espresso with the new WayCap glass coffee drinks: a better way to appreciate your espresso.
 WayCap is compatible with the following Nespresso® machines:- Inissia- Essenza- Lattissima- Pixie- Citiz- U- Maestria- Prodigio- Kitchen Aid

<p>Hi. My name is Anthony and i have been Living in Lebanon for the past 10 odd years. I work at a wedding and events company. Over the years here in Lebanon i have made many friends and met many people. My parents, and a few of these friends including (my now 'Mother In Law' to be) and my Fiance have always given clothes to Charities and whenever possible given clothes and food and other items to the poorer families in our community. It is now Low Season for weddings here in Lebanon as it is winter time and the fashion for weddings is outdoors so i have had some time on my hands and been thinking about Christmas and how i can do my part. There are many Orphanages in Lebanon. While most are well kept and provide well for the Children who occupy them. There are a few who are smaller and rely mainly on the communities around them for anything more than the bare minimums. These are the Orphanages i will be focusing on. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I will be making an honest attempt to raise some money in order to buy gifts for as many orphans as i can manage in order to surprise them just in time for Christmas. If i can't raise enough to buy Gifts then i will be using the money to cook as many meals as possible. The Orphans and the Management are not aware of my attempt as i don't want to let anyone down should i fail. I will However use Whatever funding i do obtain (as little or as much as it may be) to Buy Gifts of Provide a Christmas meal for the Children.</p>
<p>My mother in Law to be, as well as my Fiance, will be helping me as they have been doing this charitable work for many years, as well as a few friends to help me distribute the Gifts or Meals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As far as perks go, I am not really sure what i can give you back other than the knowledge that you have provided a gift for someone who wasn't expecting anything. Or a proper Christmas meal as opposed to the regular Daily Rations, and definitely put a smile on a lot of children's faces. However if you leave an email address i hope to get a group photo of the children with their gifts / dinner, and maybe a signed card that i can send out to you all by email.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I would just like to remind you that this is an honest attempt and i am acting on Faith that i may be able to do my part in making a few children's Christmas a Happy One. Therefore i will not be putting a minimum donation in order to receive a perk. Nor will i be giving money to the management of the Orphanages which i will provide this  service to. I will be buying the gifts, and delivering the gifts personally (with a few friends and my Fiance to help). And if it turns out that i make the meals instead then i and my friends will be delivering them. This way i can Guarantee that the gifts / food go to where they are needed most. The Average value of each gift will be 10$ therefore if i reach my goal i'll be able to provide 250 gifts :) This will cover at least 1 Orphanage :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would just like to take a moment here to mention the obvious. Every Cent Helps, and i really want to thank in advance all persons who donate as well as those who just spread the word. Also i would like to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas. :)</p>

</ul><h2> </h2><h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2><p>This is Vie Belles Kickstarter project. We launched over 30 products in the last 5 years and we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for our customers. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.</p><p>In short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our supporters.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Risk: </strong>We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 4 weeks. We pad our schedule for this kind of things, but sometimes not enough.</p><p>Whatever happens, we'll get through it together. We promise.</p><div data-id=""18263411""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142801/mouoqvuijrfswqtwvftk.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1> </h1><h1><b>HELP US TO REACH MORE PEOPLE BY SHARING OUR STORY!</b></h1><div data-id=""18385002""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/VieBellesKnives"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142802/d6uibvq27p6qonpxt9v0.png"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/VieBellesKnives"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></p><div data-id=""18384998""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VieBellesKnives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142802/jbdboxrdyiigndrizhdz.png"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VieBellesKnives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></p><div data-id=""18385007""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://viebellescutlery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142803/xefgirypqsiuxuqzoqvb.png"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p> </p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""https://m.me/viebellesknives"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1399/1803/files/facebook-messenger_medium.png?v=1508371084"" src="""" style=""float: none;""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://viebellescutlery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></p><div data-id=""18263450""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142803/u6ls8kee0kviycfqune8.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""18305443""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://viebellescutlery.com/community/press-kit"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Please click here to access the Vie Belles Press Kit."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142804/qmqa6cjbpktqhwykqlui.jpg"" src=""""/></a><figcaption><a href=""https://viebellescutlery.com/community/press-kit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Please click here to access the Vie Belles Press Kit.</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1>

VIE BELLES LUXURY PRO CHEF'S KNIFE



Vie Belles Luxury Pro 8"" Chef Knife provides a natural hold for left-handed or right-handed chefs. Each knife is handcrafted and takes a total of 100+ hours to make. Featuring an innovative new bolster shape for unrivaled comfort, balance, and safety without compromising the cutting edge.


Handle is made from a solid piece of Cocobolo wood, which is very durable, and also resistant to insect attack, and black pure Micarta, mosaic pin and takes 32 hours to create! 
It comes with finger guard made of the grooved brass bolster. 
The sharp blade is made from VG-10 steel core, Damascus clad, 67 layers folded of SUS 430 Japan stainless steel; full tang with a double bevel razor-sharp 15° blade angle each side, 61-62 Rockwell Hardness, double for a durable edge and takes 38 hours to craft.


Soldering a stainless steel blade to a brass bolster is a difficult & time-consuming process. Only a skilled craftsman can achieve this level of standard. It was very important for us to add a grooved bolster to the knife in order to aid in thumb placement for a confident grip.

 Cocobolo: Most likely the wood most often used on custom knives, and with good reason. Cocobolo is incredibly hard, dense, and most of all, stunningly beautiful. The wood has streaks of black, purple, yellow, red, orange, brown and white. It’s simply an amazing wood. High oil content means the wood is very stable, even in damp or marine applications, as well as excelling in culinary uses. The woods oil content has the effect of killing off a variety of pathogens that end up on the surface, helping keep the handle sanitary.

 BONUS VIE BELLES EVERYDAY CUTTING BOARDInspired by modern art, our double-sided cutting board has been created with three types of wood to give its aesthetic appeal. 
The construction is an end-grain butcher block made with Oregon black walnut, maple, and oak woods then top coated with an oiled, food safe finish. 
A magnetic strip runs down the center of the block to hold knives in place for ease of storage. 
The cutting board can be stowed away sitting on its flat surface, or on its side for space efficiency.
To prevent food from being stuck in the block, we have added an extra slot on the opposite end to help with air circulation and ease of cleaning. So go ahead and store your knives away... and if food gets lodged inside - give it a good knock, the particles will fall out!A combination of professional chefs and master craftsmen have provided their expertise in the construction, design, and reliability of each cutting board.360° View 3D ViewAttention: We do not have any control over natural wood color. Natural wood vary in color over time, due to oxidation or exposure to oxygen. REVIEWWe have tested our knife and cutting board with both professional chefs and home cooks to develop a product that feels intuitive for everyone.

They are gifts - in our case, cutlery products - that are sent to our supporters as a token of appreciation for their support of our business. HOW TO BACKBecome a backer of this project and pick a perk. You will essentially be pre-ordering one of our new cutlery products. You'll get a special backer discount, and receive our products before it is available in stores. Want to buy more than one? Check out All Rewards. How to back
Choose a perk level to back this project! You will receive items stated in details. We have 11 reward levels to pick from. 
Note that you can order multiple items by doubling/tripling/etc the amount you increase your pledge by.
If there is a product you don't see on the menu but wish to add-on, inquire with us and we will work something out after our campaign ends. 

All details like shipping information and other specifics will be collected after this campaign has ended. [After the campaign has ended, all backers will receive a form to complete which entails shipping address, sales tax (if the destination address is in Canada), shipping charges and all other details & quantities to their  pledges amount.]
 RISKS AND CHALLENGESThis is Vie Belles Kickstarter project. We launched over 30 products in the last 5 years and we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for our customers. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.In short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our supporters.Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 4 weeks. We pad our schedule for this kind of things, but sometimes not enough.Whatever happens, we'll get through it together. We promise. HELP US TO REACH MORE PEOPLE BY SHARING OUR STORY!        Please click here to access the Vie Belles Press Kit.

No more fumbling with a broom and a mop during kitchen spills. One WYPE is all it takes.   Even long hairs are no match for WYPE.   

 
 

 

What people think The secret: a unique absorbent roller The reason WYPE is able to absorb and clean at the same time is that we engineered a patented, absorbent roller using advanced, environmentally-friendly materials.The outer layer of the roller is what we call a fast-absorption layer with liquid lock, meaning it quickly absorbs and locks liquids.   The outer layer consists of a semi-permeable polymer membrane, meaning it can both absorb and expel liquids. The second layer absorbs liquids and locks them in to prevent any leaks and finally, there's an elastic composite material that makes the roller squishy so it can pick up larger items.  Inside there’s a secondary brush roller, which moves in the opposite direction, depositing all the guck into the spillproof container.  Underneath is a rubber wiper that makes your floors come out squeaky clean, leaving nothing behind but a fresh bit of water infused with your favorite floor cleaner. 
Self-cleaning stationWYPE doesn’t just clean your floors, it also cleans itself. A mop’s bucket is probably the grossest part of the whole ordeal because you’re constantly double-dipping your mop in the same water. That’s why we invented the self-cleaning station, it’s basically the most advanced bucket ever made that keeps clean and dirty water in separate tanks while also cleaning and charging WYPE at the same time, all with one press of a button. 

 The self-cleaning station can be easily lifted and filled with water plus your favorite floor cleaner. When you put WYPE back after a clean, the station pumps clean water into WYPE, spins the rollers, and flushes out any dirt and debris, leaving WYPE sanitary and clean ready for the next job.   Because we know the reality of a household with running kids and clumsy husbands, we’ve made a trip-proof charging cable. It’s magnetic, just like you might have seen on Macbooks, so if someone trips, the station won’t be knocked over. Dual tank technologyThe biggest issue with a mop is that you always double-dip in a dirty bucket. That's why we've created separate clean and dirty water tanks that ensure you're never pushing dirt around.   Quiet, lightweight and ultra-flexibleOne of the best things about WYPE is that it’s cordless, lightweight, and quiet. Because it’s charging in the station, it’s always ready to go, and you’ll get a good 60 minutes of cleaning on a single charge.  It folds fully flat for those hard-to-reach places underneath furniture.   Allergy-free cleaningIf you suffer from allergies, the tools that are meant to clean your house can become your worst enemy.

And have you ever seen the dust cloud when you empty your vacuum? Yuk!Wype is different because the technology is air-free, the moist roller makes dust stick to it, rather than suck it up. The self-cleaning station flushes it out with water making it completely harmless and keeping it out of the air forever.Rewards   Replacement partsDo you want to stock up on replacement parts? We'll offer an accessory pack after the campaign! When the campaign closes, we'll send out a survey, asking for your address, and in that same email, we'll offer you the chance to add a full accessory pack for just USD$19.99.  Why are we on Indiegogo? We have successfully funded WYPE on Kickstarter, raising over $200,000 in just one month, and because so many people still want to get their hands on WYPE we moved to Indiegogo InDemand. Here you'll get the last chance to snag WYPE at a price that's below retail. If you back us on Indiegogo you'll be the first in the world to get WYPE, and this offer will never return.  Specs
 
 
 Behow is a startup focused on reinventing how we clean. Our mission is to make cleaning easier and better by applying radical engineering to something the entire world agrees on: cleaning sucks. Because we don’t just want to reinvent another iteration of the same flawed product, our slogan is simple: Behow, Next Level Clean.   Timeline   Tax, duties & VAT are covered by us!Back WYPE with peace of mind, knowing that you won't get any unexpected taxes or fees when receiving WYPE. We're covering all VAT, fees, and customs clearance for the countries listed below. Press inquiries?Kindly email pierre.laffite@yg-consultancy.com for more information and review units, or download the full press-kit here.",26.0,3,"1 Campaign

  For our Airy campaign video, we had a unique chance to collaborate with indie rock band  INVOLVERS and have their newest song Haunted on our video. We wish to collaborate with influencers and talents from various fields to combine design with everyday life happenings and phenomena.Thank you INVOLVERS ♥ You can listen to their new song Haunted through this link:  https://open.spotify.com/track/1Kvd10Klle9kCHRd...    Young Finnish Design lets the customers decide which products will be manufactured. We have a manufacturing contract with Innojok Oy, a certified lighting manufacturer in Finland.We are two designers from Finland and through our own experience we noticed that many young designers are struggling with the same issues which are producing and selling their products. It takes a lot of money, time, experience and contacts to develop, manufacture, market and sell a design product and deliver it to customers.♥ Our aim is to solve this issue for as many designers as possible ♥Young designers from Finland, such as we ourselves, display their newest prototypes in design fairs every year in Milan, Stockholm, New York, Finland and UK in the hope of finding a manufacturer and visibility for their prototypes. Simultaneously the most known and established design media publish images and articles of young Finnish designers and their prototypes. In most cases this publicity doesn´t turn into the end result of manufacturing and sales which is what the young designers are looking for.   Airy table lamp comes in white colour. Aluminium is powder painted white.    Airy table lamp creates beautiful, angular shades of light in front of and around the lamp. We need your help to bring prototypes into life through crowdfunding. We bring the coolest new designs and customers around the same table in Indiegogo and we let the customers choose by contributing to our campaigns which products they would like to have at their homes. When we reach the target amount in Indiegogo we can start manufacturing the products. Our aim is to help young designers to find a manufacturer for their prototypes and sell their designs online in Indiegogo. Our products are furniture, lighting and interior design products. Stay tuned also for our upcoming campaigns.  We are working together with professional manufacturers inside EU and we will start manufacturing when the target amount is reached. This is because before the Indiegogo-campaign we need to know that the manufacturer is able to produce the products we are offering here in Indiegogo.   Elisa Luoto CEO & Co-founder, Heidi Huovinen Design Director & Co-founder, Riikka Ylitalo Marketing & Internationalization, Esa Kapila Photographging, Annika Leppäaho Graphic Design.  The Co-founders of Young Finnish Design are both furniture designers & interior architects from Aalto University Finland.    Airy table lamp is made out of aluminium.We work hard for our campaign, because we believe in the product we are offering for you. We invest in marketing, photographing, videographing and editing.

<p>The Villa Granada is our mission headquarters and the hub for all our mission trips as well as an integrated part of the local community, serving the neighborhood in many different ways.

<p>The pool will be a place for trip participants to rest and relax after a day of hard work, and a place for children of the community to come be a part of our activities. Most of the families we serve would not otherwise have access to a swimming pool of any kind.

Like you, we got into 3D printing, for two big reasons. First, because we saw the value it can provide today - it is a barrier breaking tool that can make some amazingly cool and useful things. After getting to know its capabilities and limits, today's 3D printers are able to help people pursue their creative dreams or reach productive goals; and at the very least, be a source of entertainment.</p><p>But more importantly, we all have that unshakable feeling that 3D printers will iteratively improve until they become an everyday convenience and necessity. We know this is a future that may not be realized for 10 years, but one that requires nurturing the technology through many rounds of improvement, which seems to mirror the coming of the computer age.</p><p>We took the first steps towards this future on Kickstarter two years ago. At the time our goal was to simply make this technology more accessible to everyone, which was a lofty ambition. 3D printers were easily in excess of $1000, often had to be assembled, and required the user to learn how to write code to control it. Like many inventors we saw this and thought we could do better. So we set out to build a printer that was more user-friendly, affordable, and suitable for in-house use than any before.</p><p>On the surface, we achieved that goal (thanks to our initial backers!!), and quickly became a volume leader in the field, and many of our features were also quickly adopted by the industry. However, we know 3D printers are still not perfect. They will achieve true consumer-friendliness when the full user experience is improved and the hardware is made so extremely reliable that it cannot fail. After that, the software needs to guide the user through the entire experience and take out all the guess work. Models need to be verified and/or curated carefully so that every print can succeed. Lastly, 3D printing in general needs to be faster, with advanced product features being more affordable.</p><p>With this in mind we took 2 years of direct feedback from our users to heart in order to advance 3D Printing technology. Today’s 3D printers operate on faith that they will run properly for many hours after hitting print. We realized that the 3D printer needs to be totally redeveloped. Every single aspect of the printer must be able to be measured so that it can be corrected in real-time. Our solution for this problem was to add full sensor feedback - on everything we could; temperature, voltage, current, position, speed, bed leveling - and more. Over two-dozen sensors in total. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field and make previously common hardware challenges a thing of the past, allowing the user to focus more fully on their creative process.</p><h2><strong>The Philosophy Behind The Pro</strong></h2><p>Based on the many things we learned from making the Micro, the Pro was completely redesigned with two key principles in mind.  </p><p>A self-aware printer:</p><p>First, that every possible aspect of the printer should be a closed-loop, so that it is self-aware and can correct issues on the fly, eliminating all typical frustrations with 3D printing.</p><div><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gna4GfaZzfo"" width=""560""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
</div></div><div>Precision metal engineering:</div><p>Second, that every aspect of the printer should be precision engineered so that it is extremely rigid and predictably assembled, leading to a more consistent and standardized user experience. You’ll see this concept in the first look pre-production samples below!</p><p>The cost of precision engineering:</p><p>The Pro cost of goods is over 3 times that of the Micro. This is because we've replaced almost all of the plastic with precision metal parts that have ~15 times better tolerances. In fact the only thing the Micro and Pro have in common is the look of the enclosure, injection molded framing, and the style of the lead screws and H-gantries.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlUkF42pUmY"" width=""560""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>Next we will discuss some dramatic differences that set the Pro apart from other 3D Printers.</p><h2><strong>First Dramatic Difference - The Pro Sensor Network  </strong></h2><p>Every other 3D Printer company uses expensive, strong, standard motors, but has to slow them down so they can power through any issues and get mostly successful prints. The end result of this limitation is a practical printing speed limit of 60 mm/s to achieve quality on typical models, and prints can still fail. The Pro on the other hand uses lighter motors that are adequate for the job. However, because we are implementing full sensor feedback on all the motion axes, we do not have to use one cautious speed limit for all prints. Instead of slowing down cautiously, the Pro can push the limits of motor technology and be optimized for maximum speeds per-print and saving costs.</p><p>In addition, we’ve had 3 years to improve motors through firmware, electronic, hardware, and software optimizations, allowing them to move much faster. Non-printing speeds of 150 mm/s (shown below), and print speeds of 80 mm/s have already been achieved (in main video). The end result is a 3D printer that has the potential to be far more reliable, and uses a system with a lower cost basis than all other printers. Although it's a feature we could charge a lot for, we plan to extend these savings to the end user.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nv124XruhOM"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>Technically, the basis of these systems are sensor fusion models and closed-loop feedback control. In general terms, these are the same systems that made cell phones able to provide navigation guidance, brought about quad-copters that are affordable and easy to fly, and compose the functional structure of many other innovative technologies we take for granted today.</p><h2>Second Dramatic Difference - The Highest Efficiency Heated Bed  </h2><p>A heated bed is a feature that is still not standard on most affordable or entry-level models. That’s because it's not necessary to have one for small prints, but also because the power requirements are so huge that it increases the costs dramatically. For example, a typical heated bed would use approximately 5 watts of power per square inch! That means over a typical 7”x7” heated bed, would need 250 watts of power. That’s 6 laptops or 12 CFL light bulbs. So entry-level printers tend to avoid including one or sell it as an expensive add on.</p><p>One of the key innovations of the Pro is the most power efficient heated bed ever made for a 3D printer. Our new heated bed technology is engineered with high temperature polymers and glass, which provides strong thermal insulation and allows for a lower energy heated bed. Our system used only 0.6 watts per square inch - making it 833% more efficient! As a result, we reduced the power requirements and thus lowered the cost. We’re extending these cost savings to you by including this heated bed with the Pro, standard. Further, the bed is removable and replaceable which allows for ease of use and potential future mods or add ons.  Here is FLIR (forward looking infrared) video showing the performance of a heated bed prototype in real time.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEgGlJWQ7Zo"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><div data-id=""13402082""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p>A heated bed is an important add on for a larger 3D printer. What makes ours nice is that it has a glass surface, made of the same type of tempered glass used in cell phone and tablet screens. This provides a beautiful print bottom finish, excellent clarity, and an easily cleaned, heavy-duty surface. This new platform can make flatter, broader prints through better adhesion while reducing warp. The heated bed can also support a wider range of 3D printing materials while easing and improving print removal. Even though this heated bed uses very little power, it can reach fully operational temperatures in under a minute.</p>

<h2>
<br/>Third Dramatic Difference - Comprehensive 2 Year Warranty!</h2>
<p>We know your time and money are valuable, and that backing a project on Indiegogo carries some risk that you may be unsatisfied with the quality of the product. That’s why in exchange for your support, we will not only give you one of the first M3D Pro’s as a reward, but we will also give you an express warranty of 2 years. The best warranty we have ever seen and could support. Your warranty is transferable if you sell your printer. We will cover your printer if you use 3rd party filaments or software. We will replace your printer if there is anything wrong with it OR if you backed an early perk and just want the latest production version. The only things we won’t cover are shipping, consumable parts or parts that were obviously damaged by excessive or unusual force.</p>
<p>We are proud to offer this new and improved warranty and can now offer it for two main reasons. First and foremost, we have had two years to establish and evaluate warranties for our existing product. Over time, we have achieved a return/replacement rate far below that of the industry averages. Most importantly, we want to keep our users satisfied for a long time to come. Your approval has a much greater value than any repair costs. In order to minimize the amount of returns that could be fixed without a complete replacement, we respectfully ask the end user to pay for shipping, which we charge at cost. If you find an offer in the industry that comes close to ours, please let us know!</p>
<h2>Fourth Dramatic Difference - Tutorial Mode</h2>The number one feedback we got from backers of our original product was to have better guidance, instructions, and examples. That’s why we’ve developed a new easy-mode for the software we call tutorial mode. This version of the software allows the user to learn each feature of the system by adding only one feature in at a time. Also, in combination with all of the Pro’s sensors, the system will guide the user through every step of setting up the printer the first time, as it can detect if the printer is plugged in, powered, if the filament is installed, etc. For the first print, users can choose from a small set of curated models, with limited print settings. Over the tutorial course, users will learn features like support material and interactively learn how to print more complex models. These features are in development, according to our schedule below.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475329422/nzz3adangdmt74qcpdoo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Fifth Dramatic Difference - M3D Software Features / Standard Gcode Support</h2>
<p>Our software is always free and our products are always open to using 3rd party programs. The M3D software works on Windows, Linux, and Mac. And it is powered internally using a powerful and fast slicer known as Cura, but because we accept open/standard gcode on the Pro, we guarantee open systems like Simplify3D, Octoprint, and other standard 3rd party slicers will work on our printer with ease, which means adding after-market wireless support will be easy. We’ve added a number of core features too, many of which are proven and are going to be rolled out over the next few weeks. These can be seen on our development schedule and include important features like multi-model support, accurate time estimates, pause printing, multi-printer support (up to 10), zip-model model library support. In addition, we plan to roll out more significant improvements next year, including native-mac support, web feedback &amp; support integration, suggested model orientation, network printer support, and model integrity verification.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475329485/fca93ccfm15oqrffeyl3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Sixth Dramatic Difference - Pro Filament and 3rd Party Filament Support</h2>
<p>For the Pro, we will put forth our flagship material as a Professional (Pro) Filament on a large thin designer spool of 500 feet (152.4 meters) of industry standard 1.75 mm diameter plastic filament. We sell by length so as to give you a more honest and exact depiction of the volume of print you can get out of each roll. This spool is approximately 1 Lb (.5 Kg). The Pro filament material is the same as our current ABS-R line. This is a tough and durable material that is superior to ABS and PLA in almost every way. Everyone who uses it has switched to it because it has low warp, zero odor, is biodegradable, can be drilled &amp; tapped, and has many other benefits. That’s why we’ll include a small sample of ABS-R with your printer. However, because the printer is being sold at such a discount we are not offering a free roll with your rewards - you will need to add one.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0w1RDrK17jQ"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>With the Pro, we are open to using all filaments and we have one of the largest selections of material available. We believe in enabling your freedom to choose. For this reason, we do not chip any of our products, opening the door to third party options as well as our own filaments.The Pro's nozzle diameter is 0.4 mm, so small-chopped fibers and particular-based filaments like carbon, wood, or metal-fill should work. However, keep in mind that we can only guarantee the Pro's performance with our own filament. Lastly, we have one of the largest material selections of any 3D printer company. With over 60 combinations of materials and colors already available in our micro-spool form (250 feet), you can affordably try materials in small quantities right now. The key among these are our exciting Tough and ABS-R filaments, which we invite you to try for yourself.

<h2>Why Back a Printer From M3D?</h2>
<p>There is a divergence of companies, especially in the 3D Printing field. The first kind of company is clearly here to make a quick buck. They sell printers, move production overseas, push for super high volume by lowering prices, and copy or use standard features rather than innovating. On the other hand, there are a few companies who care about their customers, and offer a much more complete product ecosystem. They innovate new products, offer standby service and support, create jobs in their countries, and are curiously the most respected and profitable ones despite not outsourcing jobs and production.</p>
<p>M3D stands for innovation and pride in product development. We are advancing the field, moving into the full user experience. We have a 10 year goal, and have stuck to our promise to keep everything - design, assembly, fulfillment, sales, and support - in our USA headquarters in Fulton, MD.</p>
<p><br/>Most importantly, we have been in business for three years now. We have gone through many of the growing pains of a startup, and learned very hard and important lessons since our first crowd-funded campaign. Among these lessons: the importance of excellent and responsive customer service as well as clear, guiding instructions with detailed examples. The importance of a 3D printer to be able to sense itself, catch issues on the fly, and provide remote diagnosis, all to make the user experience what we wanted it to be all along. We learned the need for a senior software architect with incredible planning skills. The need for a modelling repository where the models and print settings are vetted for success. The importance of using precision metal parts and gearing, and substituting subjective processes like filing/drilling/gluing things with engineering for precision assembly using press fitting and fastener assemblies that are predictable and reliable. Lastly, we have a track record. We have been able to bootstrap our entire operation, which should drastically decrease your risk as a backer and increase your confidence in our ability to deliver.</p>

<h2>Why Support Us Now on Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Here at M3D, our mission is to make cutting-edge technologies easy to use and accessible to consumers. We aim to keep our design, assembly, fulfillment, sales, and support all in-house in our USA headquarters. To meet those ends, we haven’t paid ourselves a single cent of profit. We have reinvested all of our income into our engineering, software development, and customer support teams to expand our creative infrastructure.</p>
<p>The M3D Pro is also already successful and has a proven track record of being in demand.  Thanks to our 1000 initial backers, we have the largest crowdfunded campaign for a dedicated 3D printer in 2016.  Those early backers got the deepest discount and some special perks if they were original backers.  However we that by the time news reaches potential supporters in the coming months, many of them will have missed the narrow window of that campaign, especially internationally. That’s why we’re opening up pre-orders using Indiegogo’s Indemand platform.  The price will be going up, somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 dollars when in stock, so we are offering limited discount tiers for the coming months.</p>
<p>By supporting us, you also understand the value our innovation could provide. You realize that as one of the leaders in the niche of 3D printing, M3D has the power to encourage other printers to improve their technology and price points as it has done in the past. You can take pride in being able to say you got one of the earliest units. You receive the discount on the Pro and special warranty package as reward for your early support. The rewards are the same for each perk: The first generation M3D Pro 3D Printer, with USB cable, power supply, user manual, 2-year warranty, and a small sample of starter ABS-R filament.</p>
<p>Special considerations for backers: </p>
<ul>
<li>Within each perk, Domestic shipments will get priority (about 1-2 weeks ahead of international)  </li>
<li>VAT is NOT included. International backers must recognize that their country will charge VAT, often but not always around ~18% + 3% duties.</li>
<li>Indiegogo is not a store, and we will not offer refunds past indiegogo’s refund time period</li>
<li>Original backers of our successful crowdfund campaign have the highest priority in each month for deliveries.  And likewise, you will receive priority over any pre-orders that happen after we finish the InDemand campaign.</li>
<li>No deals offered outside this campaign are being offered here unless stated explicitly.</li>
<li>You will need to checkout on our web portal to verify your information, and to be able to add accessories. We will email you and even call you to make sure you know your rewards are available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can you afford these professional features at a competitive price?</h2>
<p>We produced the Micro, which was the first affordable, fully assembled, consumer 3D printer. We achieved that cost reduction through major innovations in the physical design as well as cost-cutting measures in the business integration. Over 2.5 years we've gained a great deal more experience, on both the engineering and business operations fronts, as we've had time to study the cost to operate the business from ""cradle to grave,"" We are investing heavily in building better quality products (more expensive tooling, more metal, high precision / toleranced parts, higher accuracy parts), and innovated the Pro sensor network, which pays for itself in greatly reduced assembly overhead, customer support, and shorter sourcing lead times. We are able to offer a lower price initially due to the bulk purchase, overall, and per perk, but the price is going up in the near future. Finally, M3D prices its products for high volume over the long term, and operates on narrower margins than most, rather than maximizing profits today. We are here to improve the industry and nurture it because we know the payoff will come later in the future.</p>
<h2>Current status  </h2>
<p>The current state of our development is shown in our video. We started making prototypes in May 2016, to first prove that we could print at the larger scale and with much faster speed on our new hardware, while using open source electronics and software. We then verified the validity of metal press fits (tolerances over 15 times better than plastic molding) and the validity of our low-power heated bed to reach temperatures of 100 degrees C. Then in July we started doing full prints on our 2nd prototype on the heated bed using a combination of pre-production and prototyped parts. Our 3rd prototype, also completed in July, is currently using completed production electronics, and is already printing as well. This is an important development as we are using our own firmware and electronics with the prototype hardware.  We are now about to finish our 4th prototype which is use about 75% production-level parts.  We expect to ship most of our units in Jan-March (updated to March-May) of 2017 and are on schedule.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475329906/tbzpciukxsl2lxan9eks.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The color on the left is 40 days ago vs the right side which is the status today.</p>
<p>Moving forward, there are only a number of small engineering and production challenges as most of our parts have been sourced or sampled in small batches. In the next 2 months, we will complete the full scale up of part production and deliver test units to a few dozen users. This was made easier by the use of CNC metalworking, which reduces lead times and guarantees tolerances in small batches. The risk for the hardware is low, especially since we’ve done this once before, but there is always the chance one part can slow us down a little. If that happens, you’ll be first to know, and we’ll definitely have some sleepless nights and work tirelessly to keep up.</p>
<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/9UI1s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to see a photo gallery of our production progress</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In parallel, the firmware will continue to be developed over the next 3 months so that we have viable printers for beta testing in November and December. It should be expected that these printers will print well, as any professional printer does today. But it may still have key features under development, such as stand alone mode, or high-accuracy error compensation still in the works. Over the next 3-4 months, the quality, precision, and speed of those systems will be improved. Thus, backers in the Jan &amp; Feb perks should expect to see their rewards as early-adopter rewards, providing a capable printer with some minimal fixes being implemented in future software updates.  </p> <p>Also in parallel, the software development team will continue to develop new modes for the printer. The software can currently communicate with our production electronics and firmware, which is a huge amount of progress this early in a campaign. All essential features of the software will be available by Jan 2017. Thus, all backers after this point should have no concern for software success. A note about Terms and Conditions: Due to the significant discount on the Pro and the need to order overhead as tightly as possible, M3D will not be able to refund an order beyond Indiegogo's refund policy. To obtain a refund from Indiegogo you must request it from them within 10 days of your contribution, please see their policy here: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms</a><br/>We will have many advanced but non-essential features added over the next 6 months.</p> <p>Special Thanks To:</p>

We know this is a future that may not be realized for 10 years, but one that requires nurturing the technology through many rounds of improvement, which seems to mirror the coming of the computer age.We took the first steps towards this future on Kickstarter two years ago. At the time our goal was to simply make this technology more accessible to everyone, which was a lofty ambition. 3D printers were easily in excess of $1000, often had to be assembled, and required the user to learn how to write code to control it. Like many inventors we saw this and thought we could do better. So we set out to build a printer that was more user-friendly, affordable, and suitable for in-house use than any before.On the surface, we achieved that goal (thanks to our initial backers!!), and quickly became a volume leader in the field, and many of our features were also quickly adopted by the industry. However, we know 3D printers are still not perfect. They will achieve true consumer-friendliness when the full user experience is improved and the hardware is made so extremely reliable that it cannot fail. After that, the software needs to guide the user through the entire experience and take out all the guess work. Models need to be verified and/or curated carefully so that every print can succeed. Lastly, 3D printing in general needs to be faster, with advanced product features being more affordable.With this in mind we took 2 years of direct feedback from our users to heart in order to advance 3D Printing technology. Today’s 3D printers operate on faith that they will run properly for many hours after hitting print. We realized that the 3D printer needs to be totally redeveloped. Every single aspect of the printer must be able to be measured so that it can be corrected in real-time. Our solution for this problem was to add full sensor feedback - on everything we could; temperature, voltage, current, position, speed, bed leveling - and more. Over two-dozen sensors in total. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field and make previously common hardware challenges a thing of the past, allowing the user to focus more fully on their creative process.The Philosophy Behind The ProBased on the many things we learned from making the Micro, the Pro was completely redesigned with two key principles in mind.  A self-aware printer:First, that every possible aspect of the printer should be a closed-loop, so that it is self-aware and can correct issues on the fly, eliminating all typical frustrations with 3D printing.

 
Precision metal engineering:Second, that every aspect of the printer should be precision engineered so that it is extremely rigid and predictably assembled, leading to a more consistent and standardized user experience. You’ll see this concept in the first look pre-production samples below!The cost of precision engineering:The Pro cost of goods is over 3 times that of the Micro. This is because we've replaced almost all of the plastic with precision metal parts that have ~15 times better tolerances. In fact the only thing the Micro and Pro have in common is the look of the enclosure, injection molded framing, and the style of the lead screws and H-gantries. Next we will discuss some dramatic differences that set the Pro apart from other 3D Printers.First Dramatic Difference - The Pro Sensor Network  Every other 3D Printer company uses expensive, strong, standard motors, but has to slow them down so they can power through any issues and get mostly successful prints. The end result of this limitation is a practical printing speed limit of 60 mm/s to achieve quality on typical models, and prints can still fail. The Pro on the other hand uses lighter motors that are adequate for the job. However, because we are implementing full sensor feedback on all the motion axes, we do not have to use one cautious speed limit for all prints. Instead of slowing down cautiously, the Pro can push the limits of motor technology and be optimized for maximum speeds per-print and saving costs.In addition, we’ve had 3 years to improve motors through firmware, electronic, hardware, and software optimizations, allowing them to move much faster. Non-printing speeds of 150 mm/s (shown below), and print speeds of 80 mm/s have already been achieved (in main video). The end result is a 3D printer that has the potential to be far more reliable, and uses a system with a lower cost basis than all other printers. Although it's a feature we could charge a lot for, we plan to extend these savings to the end user.Technically, the basis of these systems are sensor fusion models and closed-loop feedback control. In general terms, these are the same systems that made cell phones able to provide navigation guidance, brought about quad-copters that are affordable and easy to fly, and compose the functional structure of many other innovative technologies we take for granted today.Second Dramatic Difference - The Highest Efficiency Heated Bed  A heated bed is a feature that is still not standard on most affordable or entry-level models. That’s because it's not necessary to have one for small prints, but also because the power requirements are so huge that it increases the costs dramatically. For example, a typical heated bed would use approximately 5 watts of power per square inch! That means over a typical 7”x7” heated bed, would need 250 watts of power. That’s 6 laptops or 12 CFL light bulbs. So entry-level printers tend to avoid including one or sell it as an expensive add on.One of the key innovations of the Pro is the most power efficient heated bed ever made for a 3D printer. Our new heated bed technology is engineered with high temperature polymers and glass, which provides strong thermal insulation and allows for a lower energy heated bed. Our system used only 0.6 watts per square inch - making it 833% more efficient! As a result, we reduced the power requirements and thus lowered the cost. We’re extending these cost savings to you by including this heated bed with the Pro, standard. Further, the bed is removable and replaceable which allows for ease of use and potential future mods or add ons.  Here is FLIR (forward looking infrared) video showing the performance of a heated bed prototype in real time.A heated bed is an important add on for a larger 3D printer. What makes ours nice is that it has a glass surface, made of the same type of tempered glass used in cell phone and tablet screens. This provides a beautiful print bottom finish, excellent clarity, and an easily cleaned, heavy-duty surface. This new platform can make flatter, broader prints through better adhesion while reducing warp. The heated bed can also support a wider range of 3D printing materials while easing and improving print removal. Even though this heated bed uses very little power, it can reach fully operational temperatures in under a minute.


Third Dramatic Difference - Comprehensive 2 Year Warranty!
We know your time and money are valuable, and that backing a project on Indiegogo carries some risk that you may be unsatisfied with the quality of the product. That’s why in exchange for your support, we will not only give you one of the first M3D Pro’s as a reward, but we will also give you an express warranty of 2 years. The best warranty we have ever seen and could support. Your warranty is transferable if you sell your printer. We will cover your printer if you use 3rd party filaments or software. We will replace your printer if there is anything wrong with it OR if you backed an early perk and just want the latest production version. The only things we won’t cover are shipping, consumable parts or parts that were obviously damaged by excessive or unusual force.
We are proud to offer this new and improved warranty and can now offer it for two main reasons. First and foremost, we have had two years to establish and evaluate warranties for our existing product. Over time, we have achieved a return/replacement rate far below that of the industry averages. Most importantly, we want to keep our users satisfied for a long time to come. Your approval has a much greater value than any repair costs. In order to minimize the amount of returns that could be fixed without a complete replacement, we respectfully ask the end user to pay for shipping, which we charge at cost. If you find an offer in the industry that comes close to ours, please let us know!
Fourth Dramatic Difference - Tutorial ModeThe number one feedback we got from backers of our original product was to have better guidance, instructions, and examples. That’s why we’ve developed a new easy-mode for the software we call tutorial mode. This version of the software allows the user to learn each feature of the system by adding only one feature in at a time. Also, in combination with all of the Pro’s sensors, the system will guide the user through every step of setting up the printer the first time, as it can detect if the printer is plugged in, powered, if the filament is installed, etc. For the first print, users can choose from a small set of curated models, with limited print settings. Over the tutorial course, users will learn features like support material and interactively learn how to print more complex models. These features are in development, according to our schedule below.
Fifth Dramatic Difference - M3D Software Features / Standard Gcode Support
Our software is always free and our products are always open to using 3rd party programs. The M3D software works on Windows, Linux, and Mac. And it is powered internally using a powerful and fast slicer known as Cura, but because we accept open/standard gcode on the Pro, we guarantee open systems like Simplify3D, Octoprint, and other standard 3rd party slicers will work on our printer with ease, which means adding after-market wireless support will be easy. We’ve added a number of core features too, many of which are proven and are going to be rolled out over the next few weeks. These can be seen on our development schedule and include important features like multi-model support, accurate time estimates, pause printing, multi-printer support (up to 10), zip-model model library support. In addition, we plan to roll out more significant improvements next year, including native-mac support, web feedback & support integration, suggested model orientation, network printer support, and model integrity verification.

Sixth Dramatic Difference - Pro Filament and 3rd Party Filament Support
For the Pro, we will put forth our flagship material as a Professional (Pro) Filament on a large thin designer spool of 500 feet (152.4 meters) of industry standard 1.75 mm diameter plastic filament. We sell by length so as to give you a more honest and exact depiction of the volume of print you can get out of each roll. This spool is approximately 1 Lb (.5 Kg). The Pro filament material is the same as our current ABS-R line. This is a tough and durable material that is superior to ABS and PLA in almost every way. Everyone who uses it has switched to it because it has low warp, zero odor, is biodegradable, can be drilled & tapped, and has many other benefits. That’s why we’ll include a small sample of ABS-R with your printer. However, because the printer is being sold at such a discount we are not offering a free roll with your rewards - you will need to add one.

With the Pro, we are open to using all filaments and we have one of the largest selections of material available. We believe in enabling your freedom to choose. For this reason, we do not chip any of our products, opening the door to third party options as well as our own filaments.The Pro's nozzle diameter is 0.4 mm, so small-chopped fibers and particular-based filaments like carbon, wood, or metal-fill should work. However, keep in mind that we can only guarantee the Pro's performance with our own filament. Lastly, we have one of the largest material selections of any 3D printer company. With over 60 combinations of materials and colors already available in our micro-spool form (250 feet), you can affordably try materials in small quantities right now. The key among these are our exciting Tough and ABS-R filaments, which we invite you to try for yourself. To learn more, check out http://printm3d.com/3d-printer-filaments

Why Back a Printer From M3D?
There is a divergence of companies, especially in the 3D Printing field. The first kind of company is clearly here to make a quick buck. They sell printers, move production overseas, push for super high volume by lowering prices, and copy or use standard features rather than innovating. On the other hand, there are a few companies who care about their customers, and offer a much more complete product ecosystem. They innovate new products, offer standby service and support, create jobs in their countries, and are curiously the most respected and profitable ones despite not outsourcing jobs and production.
M3D stands for innovation and pride in product development. We are advancing the field, moving into the full user experience. We have a 10 year goal, and have stuck to our promise to keep everything - design, assembly, fulfillment, sales, and support - in our USA headquarters in Fulton, MD.
Most importantly, we have been in business for three years now. We have gone through many of the growing pains of a startup, and learned very hard and important lessons since our first crowd-funded campaign. Among these lessons: the importance of excellent and responsive customer service as well as clear, guiding instructions with detailed examples. The importance of a 3D printer to be able to sense itself, catch issues on the fly, and provide remote diagnosis, all to make the user experience what we wanted it to be all along. We learned the need for a senior software architect with incredible planning skills. The need for a modelling repository where the models and print settings are vetted for success. The importance of using precision metal parts and gearing, and substituting subjective processes like filing/drilling/gluing things with engineering for precision assembly using press fitting and fastener assemblies that are predictable and reliable. Lastly, we have a track record. We have been able to bootstrap our entire operation, which should drastically decrease your risk as a backer and increase your confidence in our ability to deliver.

Why Support Us Now on Indiegogo?
Here at M3D, our mission is to make cutting-edge technologies easy to use and accessible to consumers. We aim to keep our design, assembly, fulfillment, sales, and support all in-house in our USA headquarters. To meet those ends, we haven’t paid ourselves a single cent of profit. We have reinvested all of our income into our engineering, software development, and customer support teams to expand our creative infrastructure.
The M3D Pro is also already successful and has a proven track record of being in demand.  Thanks to our 1000 initial backers, we have the largest crowdfunded campaign for a dedicated 3D printer in 2016.  Those early backers got the deepest discount and some special perks if they were original backers.  However we that by the time news reaches potential supporters in the coming months, many of them will have missed the narrow window of that campaign, especially internationally. That’s why we’re opening up pre-orders using Indiegogo’s Indemand platform.  The price will be going up, somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 dollars when in stock, so we are offering limited discount tiers for the coming months.
By supporting us, you also understand the value our innovation could provide. You realize that as one of the leaders in the niche of 3D printing, M3D has the power to encourage other printers to improve their technology and price points as it has done in the past. You can take pride in being able to say you got one of the earliest units. You receive the discount on the Pro and special warranty package as reward for your early support. The rewards are the same for each perk: The first generation M3D Pro 3D Printer, with USB cable, power supply, user manual, 2-year warranty, and a small sample of starter ABS-R filament.
Special considerations for backers: 

Within each perk, Domestic shipments will get priority (about 1-2 weeks ahead of international)  
VAT is NOT included. International backers must recognize that their country will charge VAT, often but not always around ~18% + 3% duties.
Indiegogo is not a store, and we will not offer refunds past indiegogo’s refund time period
Original backers of our successful crowdfund campaign have the highest priority in each month for deliveries.  And likewise, you will receive priority over any pre-orders that happen after we finish the InDemand campaign.
No deals offered outside this campaign are being offered here unless stated explicitly.
You will need to checkout on our web portal to verify your information, and to be able to add accessories. We will email you and even call you to make sure you know your rewards are available.

How can you afford these professional features at a competitive price?
We produced the Micro, which was the first affordable, fully assembled, consumer 3D printer. We achieved that cost reduction through major innovations in the physical design as well as cost-cutting measures in the business integration. Over 2.5 years we've gained a great deal more experience, on both the engineering and business operations fronts, as we've had time to study the cost to operate the business from ""cradle to grave,"" We are investing heavily in building better quality products (more expensive tooling, more metal, high precision / toleranced parts, higher accuracy parts), and innovated the Pro sensor network, which pays for itself in greatly reduced assembly overhead, customer support, and shorter sourcing lead times. We are able to offer a lower price initially due to the bulk purchase, overall, and per perk, but the price is going up in the near future. Finally, M3D prices its products for high volume over the long term, and operates on narrower margins than most, rather than maximizing profits today. We are here to improve the industry and nurture it because we know the payoff will come later in the future.
Current status  
The current state of our development is shown in our video. We started making prototypes in May 2016, to first prove that we could print at the larger scale and with much faster speed on our new hardware, while using open source electronics and software. We then verified the validity of metal press fits (tolerances over 15 times better than plastic molding) and the validity of our low-power heated bed to reach temperatures of 100 degrees C. Then in July we started doing full prints on our 2nd prototype on the heated bed using a combination of pre-production and prototyped parts. Our 3rd prototype, also completed in July, is currently using completed production electronics, and is already printing as well. This is an important development as we are using our own firmware and electronics with the prototype hardware.  We are now about to finish our 4th prototype which is use about 75% production-level parts.  We expect to ship most of our units in Jan-March (updated to March-May) of 2017 and are on schedule.

The color on the left is 40 days ago vs the right side which is the status today.
Moving forward, there are only a number of small engineering and production challenges as most of our parts have been sourced or sampled in small batches. In the next 2 months, we will complete the full scale up of part production and deliver test units to a few dozen users. This was made easier by the use of CNC metalworking, which reduces lead times and guarantees tolerances in small batches. The risk for the hardware is low, especially since we’ve done this once before, but there is always the chance one part can slow us down a little. If that happens, you’ll be first to know, and we’ll definitely have some sleepless nights and work tirelessly to keep up.

In parallel, the firmware will continue to be developed over the next 3 months so that we have viable printers for beta testing in November and December. It should be expected that these printers will print well, as any professional printer does today. But it may still have key features under development, such as stand alone mode, or high-accuracy error compensation still in the works. Over the next 3-4 months, the quality, precision, and speed of those systems will be improved. Thus, backers in the Jan & Feb perks should expect to see their rewards as early-adopter rewards, providing a capable printer with some minimal fixes being implemented in future software updates.   Also in parallel, the software development team will continue to develop new modes for the printer. The software can currently communicate with our production electronics and firmware, which is a huge amount of progress this early in a campaign. All essential features of the software will be available by Jan 2017. Thus, all backers after this point should have no concern for software success. A note about Terms and Conditions: Due to the significant discount on the Pro and the need to order overhead as tightly as possible, M3D will not be able to refund an order beyond Indiegogo's refund policy. To obtain a refund from Indiegogo you must request it from them within 10 days of your contribution, please see their policy here: https://www.indiegogo.com/about/termsWe will have many advanced but non-essential features added over the next 6 months. Special Thanks To:
Bluerock Productions, Mitchell & Best Homes
Geoff Britten, Tom Meeks, Russell Holly,
...and one very hard-working M3D Team.

They were the wrong shape, clunky and always ended up falling apart. We invented Teebee for our children, to encourage their creativity whilst on long journey's and we want to share that with thousands of children across the world. Teebee has become our best friend during the last year and we think you are going to love Teebee as much as we do. So please spread the word, share with fellow parents, or be the coolest Aunt and Uncle around bringing Teebee to someone's hands!</p><p>We are launching Teebee via Indiegogo to cover the costs of initiating production, further improve the Teebee series of toypods, and most importantly, to get to know what YOU think about Teebee. With your help, we can make travelling with kids even more enjoyable. </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497011932/oap2jj1m6fkqnovfacpw.png"" src=""""/></h3><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.indiegogo.com/projects/teebee-the-new-toy-box-for-kids-on-the-go-tablet-toys"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497012002/ea4jv5thqvcdzo5dwh98.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/home?status=Check%20out%20this%20alternative%20to%20tablets%20when%20travelling%20with%20kids.%20%0ASee%20more%20at%3A%20https%3A//igg.me/at/teebeebox%20%0A%23familytravel%20%23parents%20%23kids%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497012013/lrm44kpxrzg8mvpycz6h.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//igg.me/at/teebeebox&amp;title=Crowdfunding%20Campaign%20Teebee&amp;summary=&amp;source="" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497012024/zfxweiugo7bskv2x7hho.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497011944/ykzjbzi3kqcarpybpfzp.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>The team behind Teebee is a group of design and toy enthusiasts with many years experience in product development, marketing and entrepreneurship.

They were the wrong shape, clunky and always ended up falling apart. We invented Teebee for our children, to encourage their creativity whilst on long journey's and we want to share that with thousands of children across the world. Teebee has become our best friend during the last year and we think you are going to love Teebee as much as we do. So please spread the word, share with fellow parents, or be the coolest Aunt and Uncle around bringing Teebee to someone's hands!We are launching Teebee via Indiegogo to cover the costs of initiating production, further improve the Teebee series of toypods, and most importantly, to get to know what YOU think about Teebee. With your help, we can make travelling with kids even more enjoyable.  The team behind Teebee is a group of design and toy enthusiasts with many years experience in product development, marketing and entrepreneurship. Teebee was developed out of Tablebox ApS, a company with 4 years of experience creating innovative and user-friendly solutions in cardboard for the food and beverage industry. We have a broad variety of personal and educational background.

You, the amazing digital community out there, believed in us and our products before anyone knew that we even existed.</p><p>Your overwhelming support and feedback has been crucial for our development and where we are today. <strong>Thank you so much</strong> for your encouragement all the way.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce our newest family member. We offer you, the community that cares the most, the chance to back our vision once again and gain exclusive access to our newest invention – the <strong>zirb.Mini</strong>.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544520745/plvas0c62rtrcfjuuvne.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><h3>What is the Austrian Stone Pine?</h3><p>The Austrian Stone Pine, pinus cembra or ""Zirbelkiefer"" (as we call it here in Austria) is the last tree standing, before the timberline. Consequently, it mostly <strong>grows 1800 meter above sea level</strong>, exclusively in the Alps. For centuries, people from the Alps have been building furniture and rooms from Austrian Stone Pine.</p><p>For everyone still wondering what the Austrian Stone Pine actually smells like, imagine the following scene: You are hiking through a vital green colored middle European high alpine pine forest. The sun is rising and the freshness of the morning is in the air. You stand still to enjoy the beautiful nature and you are fascinated by how alive and relaxed you feel. You take a deep breath in… Now hold right there! It’s the Austrian Stone Pine you are smelling :)</p><p> </p><h3>Why are we developing zirb.Mini?</h3><p>We are more than proud to claim more than 3000 satisfied customers over the last three years. It has been a great privilege to <strong>improve</strong> their <strong>daily lives</strong> and <strong>wellbeing</strong> with our products.</p><p>Standard scent dispensers work with of a lot of synthetic remedy and are mostly made out of plastic. Moreover one usually has to plug them directly into the outlet. Whereas zirb.Mini consists of <strong>natural materials</strong> such as Austrian Stone Pine, fair-faced concrete and ceramic.</p><p>The ""best solution"" and only way in the past for diffusing the essence of the Austrian Stone Pine was trickling some drops into a small wooden bowl. This required you to actively drip some of the valuable essential oil every day. This is not convenient at all. The <strong>zirb.Mini revolutionizes the continuous diffusing functionality of essential oils</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544521610/vipci8qeaub1x2bnejcd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Because Austrian Stone Pine is the slowest growing pine tree in Europe it is not only the most expensive but also one of the <strong>most exclusive</strong>. Although many potential customers love this special scent, the high price for bigger furniture made from Austrian Stone Pine depicted an obstacle. This is the main reason why we invented an awesome like-minded product at a price which appeals also to people who haven't experienced the character and <strong>benefits of the stone pine scent</strong> yet.</p><p>Additionally, we always wanted to create a product which also works as a <strong>perfect present</strong> for everybody. No matter if you want to gift yourself or one of your loved ones. zirb.Mini embodies an investment in well-being and health. It is up to you now, to give yourself or somebody else a treat.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544521661/kkickjoyocgul6tlqw0g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Another reason for developing the zirb.Mini is finding an <strong>efficient scent solution</strong> for smaller rooms (below 20 square meters). On the one hand the <strong>built-in ventilator</strong> in combination with the<strong> patented zirb.Oil</strong> perfectly spreads the natural scent within smaller spaces. On the other hand the compact design of the product makes it easy to position it anywhere.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544521868/z5wdvao96ofnslizppk9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Mobile first! With the need for creating a handy and results-producing ventilation system, we thought of (nearly) every possible application.

You, the amazing digital community out there, believed in us and our products before anyone knew that we even existed.Your overwhelming support and feedback has been crucial for our development and where we are today. Thank you so much for your encouragement all the way.Today, we are proud to announce our newest family member. We offer you, the community that cares the most, the chance to back our vision once again and gain exclusive access to our newest invention – the zirb.Mini.What is the Austrian Stone Pine?The Austrian Stone Pine, pinus cembra or ""Zirbelkiefer"" (as we call it here in Austria) is the last tree standing, before the timberline. Consequently, it mostly grows 1800 meter above sea level, exclusively in the Alps. For centuries, people from the Alps have been building furniture and rooms from Austrian Stone Pine.For everyone still wondering what the Austrian Stone Pine actually smells like, imagine the following scene: You are hiking through a vital green colored middle European high alpine pine forest. The sun is rising and the freshness of the morning is in the air. You stand still to enjoy the beautiful nature and you are fascinated by how alive and relaxed you feel. You take a deep breath in… Now hold right there! It’s the Austrian Stone Pine you are smelling :) Why are we developing zirb.Mini?We are more than proud to claim more than 3000 satisfied customers over the last three years. It has been a great privilege to improve their daily lives and wellbeing with our products.Standard scent dispensers work with of a lot of synthetic remedy and are mostly made out of plastic. Moreover one usually has to plug them directly into the outlet. Whereas zirb.Mini consists of natural materials such as Austrian Stone Pine, fair-faced concrete and ceramic.The ""best solution"" and only way in the past for diffusing the essence of the Austrian Stone Pine was trickling some drops into a small wooden bowl. This required you to actively drip some of the valuable essential oil every day. This is not convenient at all. The zirb.Mini revolutionizes the continuous diffusing functionality of essential oils.Because Austrian Stone Pine is the slowest growing pine tree in Europe it is not only the most expensive but also one of the most exclusive. Although many potential customers love this special scent, the high price for bigger furniture made from Austrian Stone Pine depicted an obstacle. This is the main reason why we invented an awesome like-minded product at a price which appeals also to people who haven't experienced the character and benefits of the stone pine scent yet.Additionally, we always wanted to create a product which also works as a perfect present for everybody. No matter if you want to gift yourself or one of your loved ones. zirb.Mini embodies an investment in well-being and health. It is up to you now, to give yourself or somebody else a treat.Another reason for developing the zirb.Mini is finding an efficient scent solution for smaller rooms (below 20 square meters). On the one hand the built-in ventilator in combination with the patented zirb.Oil perfectly spreads the natural scent within smaller spaces. On the other hand the compact design of the product makes it easy to position it anywhere.Mobile first! With the need for creating a handy and results-producing ventilation system, we thought of (nearly) every possible application. No matter if you want to surprise and impress your working colleagues in the meeting room (trust me...they will love it) or taking your zirb.Mini along on your business trip. Since the zirb.Mini is running on a standard USB cable, the possibilities of where you can take it are almost endless.What does zirb.Mini do for you?Your zirb.Mini works 24/7 for your well-being. After a quick plug'n' play installation you have the option to easily change the zirb.Oil every other month. The exchange of the zirb.Oil will take you only few seconds. Now you can sustain the pleasant high alpine scent throughout the entire year.No Plastic waste – unlike almost all other scent dispensers on the market.No artificial chemicals or any other synthetic stuff that you are breathing. The production of our zirb.Oil is monitored in the most rigorous way possible. All arrangements for inspection of the European Union are met in an exemplary manner. If you could only smell this natural essential scent right now, you would definitely know what we’re talking about.Did you know that the olfactory sense was the first sense that we humans had? This also explains why the sense of smell is directly connected to our brain. Briefly speaking, a stuffy meeting room will automatically make you feel a little slack and maybe even tired, whereas the smell of your grandmother's freshly baked Christmas cookies will immediately make you feel happy.We all are confronted and working with screens (Mobile, Laptop, iPad, etc.) all day. This sometimes lets us forget we don't solely exist digitally, but also have a body which needs rest. zirb.Mini will independently help you noticing that you physically have arrived home (or your room of choice) in order to start the regenerating process of your body. Feeling more relaxed and well-balanced from the special natural scent of the Austrian Stone Pine makes sense if you know the good feeling of returning home after a long hike through nature. Simply put, zirb.Mini makes you feel like you are in the refreshing nature while being in your room.With it's simplistic and modern design the zirb.Mini is delightful to look at. The exclusive natural components constitutes an upgrade to any interior design. Fitting into both –a rather classic interior, as well as an modern designed space – is another strength of zirb.Mini.To sum it up the zirb.Mini is different to the normal synthetic scent diffuser in so many ways:Normal Synthetic Diffuser

<p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/003/245/159/2b9da1d367980988ad826c8192d2dff0_large.JPG?1423256529"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><ul><li>2)
	Acts as the base for clearing food when using the flat discs. When 
inserted in the Rouncer base device’s semi-circular groove and the 
handle is pressed down, the food cuttings clears the blades and collects

<li>Simply cut an onion into half with a knife and chop of the two ends 
with shoot and stem, and then place it in the semi-circular groove of 
the Rouncer base unit, attach the round onion blade on the top blade 
slot of the unit (pick one out of the 14 depending on your requirement).</li>
<li>Use the top base unit handle to hand press the blade through the 
onion in the bottom base unit. This will force the onion through the 
blades.</li>
<li>The onion will not completely go through and collect in the top 
compartment, about 2mm of the onion skin will stay below the blade which
 ensures that the scaly leaf does not get cut and go through the blades.</li>
<li>Remove the scaly leaf before adding the next onion to cut up. </li>
<li>Lift up the top handle of the device, simply peel off the scaly skin on top of the blade.</li>
<li>Put the lid down and turn the device upside down to shake and allow 
any vegetables stuck between blades to fall through. Use the platform 
filler tool which also acts as a dicing/slicing clearing tool to clean 
blades of cuttings which are stuck in between.</li>
<li>To use any of the flat cutting blades, insert the blade, but place 
the semi-circular plastic space filler in the bottom base unit groove to
 cover the onion slot and make the surface flat. You can then use the 
device in the same way as above.</li>
<li>To use the disc blades, insert part to the blade slot and then turn 
the device upside down with the lid open and away from the base, 
rotating to the opposite direction. To use the disc blades, you simply 
slide to mandoline cut, grate, wavy slice and more on the underside of 
the top lid handle cover rather which is now exposed to the top. Please 
refer to images for more guidance.</li>

<p>We came up with sketches of <b>Prototype 1</b> of the Rouncer, and 
started looking at perfecting the design, reducing costs as 
three different blades would require three different housing blade drums
 and moulds. By creating a clever grooved blade housing, we managed to 
build this product with only one tool that allows us to interchange its 
assembly. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the £40 - £60 
price range.</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/003/046/152/39cb0e643477a1f0b1782cb8cd2105b4_large.jpg?1418577042"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure>
<p> Our revisions produced <b>Prototype 2</b> which was cool, sleek and 
trendy. 3D printed using our very own Form Labs 1+ Printer. Once we got

The Clearing Tool:
This tool has three functions:
1)	Help in the cleaning of the Rounded Onion dicing and slicing 
blades after use in order to clear out any onion leaves left behind or 
stuck in between the blades.
 2)
	Acts as the base for clearing food when using the flat discs. When 
inserted in the Rouncer base device’s semi-circular groove and the 
handle is pressed down, the food cuttings clears the blades and collects
 in the small container thanks to the clearing tool and its spikes. 3)
	 Disc blade hand guard. When using the disc blades for its mandolin 
functions in slicing, wavy cutting and even for grating, the hand guard 
allows you to latch on to the top of the vegetable or block of cheese as
 you get closer to the blades in order to avoid any finger cuts.  How to use the Rouncer:Take a look at our video for an easy guide on what our patented Rouncer will do for you!
Simply cut an onion into half with a knife and chop of the two ends 
with shoot and stem, and then place it in the semi-circular groove of 
the Rouncer base unit, attach the round onion blade on the top blade 
slot of the unit (pick one out of the 14 depending on your requirement).
Use the top base unit handle to hand press the blade through the 
onion in the bottom base unit. This will force the onion through the 
blades.
The onion will not completely go through and collect in the top 
compartment, about 2mm of the onion skin will stay below the blade which
 ensures that the scaly leaf does not get cut and go through the blades.
Remove the scaly leaf before adding the next onion to cut up. 
Lift up the top handle of the device, simply peel off the scaly skin on top of the blade.
Put the lid down and turn the device upside down to shake and allow 
any vegetables stuck between blades to fall through. Use the platform 
filler tool which also acts as a dicing/slicing clearing tool to clean 
blades of cuttings which are stuck in between.
To use any of the flat cutting blades, insert the blade, but place 
the semi-circular plastic space filler in the bottom base unit groove to
 cover the onion slot and make the surface flat. You can then use the 
device in the same way as above.
To use the disc blades, insert part to the blade slot and then turn 
the device upside down with the lid open and away from the base, 
rotating to the opposite direction. To use the disc blades, you simply 
slide to mandoline cut, grate, wavy slice and more on the underside of 
the top lid handle cover rather which is now exposed to the top. Please 
refer to images for more guidance.

 How the Kitchen Revolution was BORN!!!!
 We sprayed the prototypes with acrylic resin and took professional 
studio images to show and develop our concept, The final production 
results are shown below.
The Rouncer Family
Rouncer comes carefully designed in 3 Gorgeous Colours! The ""Autumn Lemon"" , ""The Old Grey"" and '' The Flaming Flamenco.''
    The Flaming Flamenco

Rouncer – Form, Function and High Quality
We have designed the Rouncer with quality in mind, a uniquely 
designed product like nothing else available in the market, a real 
problem solver and one we believe that will make the world a better 
place!
It will be constructed of the finest materials and created with precision quality. There will also be a money-back guarantee against defects or cancellation.
Home and kitchen products have become very popular with consumers 
looking for new cool and useful products to add to their kitchen gadget 
list. The Rouncer will become a must have tool for every kitchen just as
 a knife would be, the ability to save you time and stop tears has been 
very well accepted by reviewers. 
Get perfectly sized and square cut diced onions every time! Slices 
are of the same thickness every time you chop onions! No more health and
 safety concerns whilst cutting onions, this is a common knife cut in 
the kitchen that you can do without, and now with the Rouncer, you can 
chop away safely.

 
In the News:

Our initial prototype V1 made the news because of what it 
represented, the idea that could become part of everyone's life through 
their kitchen!
http://www.cateringinsight.com/16150-onion-slicer-maker-looking-for-investors/
What can you do with the Rouncer:
Comes with 14 Multifunctional blades included in the Rouncer including:  The
 Spiral Julienne strips cutter, Apple coring, Peeler, Grater, Mandoline 
slicer, Herb chopper, square cutter, pie cutter, rectangular cutter, 
wavy slicer.
Here are some meals we prepared, with the vegetables and fruits only cut using Rouncer.
  The Journey to Achieving PERFECTION!
We came up with sketches of Prototype 1 of the Rouncer, and 
started looking at perfecting the design, reducing costs as 
three different blades would require three different housing blade drums
 and moulds. By creating a clever grooved blade housing, we managed to 
build this product with only one tool that allows us to interchange its 
assembly. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the £40 - £60 
price range.
 
 Our revisions produced Prototype 2 which was cool, sleek and 
trendy. 3D printed using our very own Form Labs 1+ Printer. Once we got 
this in our hands we collectively agreed that it would need to be sleek 
and stackable.
 
Finally we came up with Prototype 3 as shown on all our images
 which put forward our vision for this product perfectly. We modified 
the blade housing to require a single moulding tool, the product evolved
 to a multi functional blade tool giving customers more value for their 
money! Truly amazing!The Newtonstein Team

Although cold drip uses cold water to brew coffee just like other regular ‘tea bag style’ cold brew, we concluded that the drip method provided the best flavor that you cannot taste with any other brew method.We soon realized that although there are numerous ‘tea bag style’ cold brewers on the market, there were very few true cold drip brewers and they were all too expensive. So we made it our mission to make one for ourselves.We had a pretty successful initial launch last year in a select market. With valuable user feedback and experience, we have made some improvements from our first model and now we are trying to launch our upgraded version on the US market for the first time.We have lined up our suppliers and manufacturers that we have worked with for our initial model all ready to go and we just need your help to bring BeanPlus into the mass production stage!Unlike regular cold brewers that employ the ‘tea bag method’ (immersion of coffee grind in a water container), BeanPlus Cold Drip Brewer utilizes the ‘drip method’ that is also known as the ‘dutch coffee’ or ‘kyoto coffee’ brewing method. Although both methods are cold brew that yields smooth, less acidic, flavorful coffee, the ‘drip method’ has 3 distinct advantages over regular ‘tea bag method’ cold brew:
Cold drip offers richer, more complex, and full bodied flavor that you cannot taste with any other brewing method.
Cold drip requires only 4 hours of minimum brewing time compared to minimum of 12 hours for tea bag method.
Cold drip method requires much less coffee grounds than tea bag method when brewing coffee.
Previously, there have been dutch coffee or kyoto coffee brewers out in the market but the cost was well over a few hundred dollars. BeanPlus Cold Drip Brewer is the only true cold drip brewer that is also affordable.Patented Slow Drip Valve The Cold Drip Brewer creates delicious cold brew coffee through its patented slow drip valve. Create your perfect cup of coffee by adjusting the valve to achieve your desired strength. Unlike other brewers on the market, Beanplus adjusts water drip rate through the water filter rather than adjusting size of the drip hole, ensuring a consistent drip rate to produce ultimate flavor satisfaction.Non Clogging Drip Mechanism + Water Filter Crafted with a unique built-in water filter that enables the system to purify your water while regulating the drip speed to achieve a completely constant drip rate from beginning to end.

Is this for real?</b><br/>We have an amazing team to make Jibo a reality! While not everything in the video will necessarily be there at launch, the JIBO skills described above are part of the core skill set. And, because of the rich platform and ecosystem we're building, everything in the video beyond the core skills will be possible -- and more! With our developer community, we will continue to improve the product and add new and exciting features over time.</p><p><b>I preordered a JIBO, but I didn’t get a confirmation email.

JIBO, Inc. will keep you notified of your JIBO ship date.</p><p><b>Where Does JIBO Ship?</b><br/>We currently ship to the US &amp; Canada, EU (all 28 countries). All JIBO's use US American-accented English. Support of other languages and accents will come in the future. </p><p><b>What can I do with the JIBO Network?</b><br/>Through the devices in your JIBO Network, you can send fun voice messages and texts brought to life with expression packs, share photos and videos, set reminders, interact with others via telepresence, visit the store, or add new skills or content to JIBO -- wherever you are!</p><p><b>Does JIBO walk or have wheels? Where should I place him?</b><br/>No. The best spot to place him is where most of your household activities happen (like in your kitchen or the family room), or where you expect you'll want JIBO's companionship and assistance the most.  He's a member of the family and is at his best when he is with you.</p><p><b>Is JIBO a male or a female?</b><br/>JIBO is gendered male.</p><p><b>Can I name him something other than JIBO?</b><br/>​Not yet. In the current release you have to use the name JIBO to address him. Future updates may allow for the possibility to give your JIBO a new name of your choice.</p><p><b>What languages does JIBO support? When will he speak other languages?</b><br/>JIBO will understand US American-accented English when he comes to your home. Over time, JIBO will be able to communicate in other languages in the future.  We will keep the community posted.</p><p><b>Do I need a WiFi network?</b><br/>Yes. You must have Jibo connected to a WiFi network for JIBO to work.</p><p><b>How do I charge JIBO?</b><br/>JIBO comes with an AC charging supply that works with 110/220V.  Jibo ships with a user-replaceable battery, and you will be able to order additional batteries as accessories. JIBO is designed to run for 30 minutes on battery power.</p><p><b>What kind of batteries does JIBO take?</b><br/>It will be a battery pack available as an accessory.</p><p><b>How tall is JIBO? How heavy?</b><br/>JIBO will be about 11"" tall, with a 6"" base. We estimate JIBO will be about 5 lbs, without the battery accessory.</p><p><b>Does it work with iOS and Android Devices or my computer?</b><br/>Yes. JIBO will have his own mobile app that is compatible with iOS and Android devices. He also has a web interface so you can interact via computer.</p><p><b>When will accessories be available for JIBO?</b><br/>You can purchase a number of accessories on the JIBO Store when it launches. This includes functional accessories as well as fun cosmetic items that allow you to customize the appearance of your JIBO.  We will keep you posted on the store's opening.</p><p><b>Will there be apps available for JIBO?</b><br/>JIBO apps are called Skills. You will be able to purchase these from the JIBO Store, as they become available. JIBO will also come with a number of core skills free of charge. These may include JiboSnap, JiboWatch, JiboMeet, JiboJot, and JiboStory.</p><p><b>When does the JIBO Store open?</b><br/>We will let you know as soon as the store opens. We are excited about its launch. Developers will be able to submit skills or applications for certification in advance. All skills or applications must be certified by JIBO, Inc.</p><p><b>What programming language to I need to know?</b><br/>The JIBO SDK requires knowledge of the JavaScript programming language.</p><p><b>How do I get information and support as a developer?</b><br/>When you pre-order a developer edition JIBO, you will be automatically enrolled in the JIBO Developer Program. There will also be information posted on the JIBO blog. Dedicated members of our team will provide additional support to those enrolled in the JIBO Developer Program. We want to make your JIBO Skills and digital assets come to life and are committed to working with you to make our develper tools and support truly great.</p><p><b>Is the software open source?</b><br/>The software is built on top of Linux (which is, of course, open source), but the JIBO subsystem will remain closed and proprietary for the time being. This is an area that we'll continue to look at and evaluate.</p><p><b>Can I back-up my JIBO?</b><br/>There is no need to ""back-up"" JIBO since JIBO is an always-connected device that automatically stores its data in the JIBO cloud. If your JIBO ever needs to be replaced, once you connect your new JIBO to your account, it'll automatically have all the ""knowledge"" and skills that your old JIBO had.</p><p><b>How is my privacy protected?</b><br/>Guarding our users' privacy is something we take very seriously. We work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access and have designed policies and controls to safeguard the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.</p><p><b>How secure is this?</b><br/>JIBO uses SSL encryption to secure personal data sent to and from the cloud;<br/>JIBO uses 256-bit AES encryption in the cloud; and digital certificates are used to authenticate devices.</p><p><b>How does JIBO respect my privacy?</b><br/>A combination of technology and company policies are used to protect users privacy. JIBO complies with FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection guidelines including the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA).  Company policies ensure that JIBO only collects data it needs, keeps it safe, and retains it only as long as necessary. A company security officer reviews security of all customer data at all phases of use.  JIBO employs industry standard best practices regarding the way data is stored and transferred. Passwords are stored using cryptographic one-way hash functions. This ensures that nobody, even the company security officer, can ever gain access to a users’ password.</p><p><b>How does JIBO respect my privacy?</b><br/>You can tell JIBO to go to sleep, and in that mode the camera is off. JIBO will only wake up when you ask him to.</p><p><b>Can someone watch or listen to me?</b><br/>JIBO robots have cameras and microphones that are used to interact with users and to provide the photography and messaging applications. There is no way for a remote user to enable the camera or microphone. JIBO’s user interface makes it very clear to a user when they are engaged in a video or audio chat with others. JIBO will only connect to other devices (including other JIBO robots) that have a digital certificate explicitly allowing that connection.</p><p><b>Where is my data stored?</b><br/>JIBO automatically uploads your data to the cloud. There’s no explicit backup step required. The data is encrypted while in transit and on the servers. In the event that you break your JIBO you can associate the new JIBO with the account. The data will then be available on the new JIBO.  The above step requires that JIBO’s unique serial number be authorized to access data stored under the previous JIBO’s serial number. This affinity between account and serial number prevents unauthorized access to your information.</p><p><b>What data does JIBO store?</b><br/>JIBO stores certain information about you and backs it up to the cloud. It is encrypted via SSL when being uploaded or downloaded from the cloud. While stored in the cloud it is encrypted via 256-bit AES. The information stored may include your name, information required to connect to your WiFi network, various preferences, and data that is entered or acquired through one of the JIBO applications. Such data includes photos, videos, lists.</p><p><b>What is the warranty?</b><br/>All product specifications, illustrations, drawings, particulars, dimensions and other information on the Site or made available by us are intended to represent no more than a general illustration of the Product and its features and do not constitute a warranty or representation by us that the Product will conform with the same.</p><p><b>Who did the industrial design for JIBO?</b><br/>We worked closely with <a href=""http://www.huge-design.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Huge Design</a> on the industrial design of JIBO, blending our own team's deep expertise in animation and social robotics with Huge Design's stellar talent in sophisticated and cutting-edge industrial design.

This is an area that we'll continue to look at and evaluate.Can I back-up my JIBO?There is no need to ""back-up"" JIBO since JIBO is an always-connected device that automatically stores its data in the JIBO cloud. If your JIBO ever needs to be replaced, once you connect your new JIBO to your account, it'll automatically have all the ""knowledge"" and skills that your old JIBO had.How is my privacy protected?Guarding our users' privacy is something we take very seriously. We work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access and have designed policies and controls to safeguard the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.How secure is this?JIBO uses SSL encryption to secure personal data sent to and from the cloud;JIBO uses 256-bit AES encryption in the cloud; and digital certificates are used to authenticate devices.How does JIBO respect my privacy?A combination of technology and company policies are used to protect users privacy. JIBO complies with FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection guidelines including the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA).  Company policies ensure that JIBO only collects data it needs, keeps it safe, and retains it only as long as necessary. A company security officer reviews security of all customer data at all phases of use.  JIBO employs industry standard best practices regarding the way data is stored and transferred. Passwords are stored using cryptographic one-way hash functions. This ensures that nobody, even the company security officer, can ever gain access to a users’ password.How does JIBO respect my privacy?You can tell JIBO to go to sleep, and in that mode the camera is off. JIBO will only wake up when you ask him to.Can someone watch or listen to me?JIBO robots have cameras and microphones that are used to interact with users and to provide the photography and messaging applications. There is no way for a remote user to enable the camera or microphone. JIBO’s user interface makes it very clear to a user when they are engaged in a video or audio chat with others. JIBO will only connect to other devices (including other JIBO robots) that have a digital certificate explicitly allowing that connection.Where is my data stored?JIBO automatically uploads your data to the cloud. There’s no explicit backup step required. The data is encrypted while in transit and on the servers. In the event that you break your JIBO you can associate the new JIBO with the account. The data will then be available on the new JIBO.  The above step requires that JIBO’s unique serial number be authorized to access data stored under the previous JIBO’s serial number. This affinity between account and serial number prevents unauthorized access to your information.What data does JIBO store?JIBO stores certain information about you and backs it up to the cloud. It is encrypted via SSL when being uploaded or downloaded from the cloud. While stored in the cloud it is encrypted via 256-bit AES. The information stored may include your name, information required to connect to your WiFi network, various preferences, and data that is entered or acquired through one of the JIBO applications. Such data includes photos, videos, lists.What is the warranty?All product specifications, illustrations, drawings, particulars, dimensions and other information on the Site or made available by us are intended to represent no more than a general illustration of the Product and its features and do not constitute a warranty or representation by us that the Product will conform with the same.Who did the industrial design for JIBO?We worked closely with Huge Design on the industrial design of JIBO, blending our own team's deep expertise in animation and social robotics with Huge Design's stellar talent in sophisticated and cutting-edge industrial design. Bill Webb, Chris Harsacky and team are top notch.Who did your movie?Bradley Leong and Kevin Lipnos at Feedback, LLC made our movie, and we recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!

<p><span>Finally, you can see that we have developed the seat with a ""quick connect"" design. This allows for the ease of removal during the first few stages of training for human use of the toilet and for easy cleaning of the toilet bowl.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>**Please note**</strong> that in the video there is only a quick glance demonstrating how the ""quick connect*/dis-connect feature works.

The only part of the system that stays connected semi-permanently (just like the human seat is semi-permanent) is the small strip that connects to the very same bolts that connect your existing human toilet seat. All that needs to be done to conduct your normal cleaning and use of the toilet is ""un-snap"" the CatMan-Doo seat from the strip.</span></p>
<p><strong>So Why Toilet Train your Cat?</strong></p>
<p>Well the first reason should be enough, A CLEANER HOME! But there are so many more! You help keep over 9 million tons of used “Toxic” cat litter from landfills. Help avoid urinary tract infections common with cats. Change the perception that when you get a cat you need to get a litter box and thus do away with the #1 reason cats are returned to shelters or just thrown out to the streets. <strong>YES! The #1 reason cats are homeless is because people become tired of cleaning litter boxes!</strong> As I said there are many more reasons, the least of which is you will SAVE MONEY BY NEVER BUYING CAT LITTER AGAIN! </p>
<p><strong>                                                        </strong><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p> Simply put CatMan-Doo is a litter box that sits on top of your toilet. Through a series of trays that start with a small hole in the center and gradually becomes larger as the cat becomes accustomed to the larger hole. We also designed CatMan-Doo with small drainage holes for when, during the training cycle, the cat urinates you will only need to pour some hot water over the washable litter thereby making it easier to keep kitty’s place clean. The cat also has a comfortable area to rest itself on as opposed to trying to balance its self on a seat made only for human use. Other training aids would try to have your cat balance on a very narrow toilet seat. Since we have allowed for multiple stages in the training process, you can rest assured that your cat will not become stressed out by all of a sudden going from a small opening to a huge one. In addition if kitty does not like going from one stage to the next, we created CatMan-Doo with the ability to go back one stage thereby allowing more time for kitty to become comfortable with the size of the hole. Once your cat has gone through all 4 stages of the system they will always have a place for them to comfortably do their business. It is also very important to note that we have the homeowners comfort in mind as well. CatMan-Doo does NOT interfere with the human toilet seat, you simply install (very easy) CatMan-Doo under the human seat. Now whenever a person needs to use the toilet you just place the seat down over CatMan-Doo. When done raise the seat to allow the cat its toilet seat this is great for all the men out there because there can never be a complaint about closing the toilet! Finally for cleaning purposes, we made CatMan-Doo easy to remove from the toilet bowl with “quick release snaps” </p>
<p><strong>                Wait... can't I just train my cat to use the toilet myself?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Why do I need CatMan-Doo?</strong> As a child my wife had a cat that actually trained himself! With no reinforcement from anyone. Cats are very clean animals. Given the choice between a litter box and toilet the cat will always choose the toilet if properly trained. So, if you want to try to do this on your own more power to you! There have been many success stories out there (just check out YouTube). Unfortunately, many times the hassle just isn’t worth it. We have seen people using duck tape together with cardboard and while its works a few times inevitably kitty falls in the toilet! We know how much cats LOVE water right? Needless to say, that if kitty gets wet even just once you can forget about them even going into the restroom at all and much less to toilet train them.</p>
<p> <strong>There are already products on the market that train a cat to use the toilet.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Why this one?</strong> True. There are a couple of products that can help your cat learn to use the toilet, but none offer a lifelong solution. Also, each of these systems expects your cat to use a toilet seat designed for people! The home built ideas, while novel, just don’t make it easy for a cat to use. We have taken all the problems and issues associated with toilet training and built the CatMan-Doo system. Once you try it you will see that CatMan-Doo <em>is</em> the right product for toilet training your cat!</p></span></span></div>","Let us explain the video...

Seamus Berkeley has painted hundreds of people, from life, while living in Taos, New Mexico where he founded the Taos Society of Portrait Artists. Since moving to the Bay Area, he has continued to create commissioned portraits and other works while also offering art instruction. For this project, Berkeley has put together a team to assist with the portraits, writing and administration of all technical and financial logistics.

Your tax deductible contribution will help launch this two year art project benefitting Family House by covering such items as paint, canvas, gesso, travel expenses and overhead for the first set of portraits.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
