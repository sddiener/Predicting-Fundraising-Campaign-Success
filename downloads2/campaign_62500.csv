Since our doula careers started, we’ve seen the bad birth trends increase, while the rights of women and babies during the childbearing year have been disregarded. Our mission is simple: Circle of Life Network is committed to providing women with the knowledge they need to become empowered and advocate for themselves by creating a safe, reliable, community that offers credible evidence-based information, resources and support from like-minded peers and birth professionals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By creating a nurturing, safe and supportive community, we can begin to reverse the damage that has been done to parents and babies. Cesarean rate is still increasing and the business of being born has become priority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are motivated by simply providing access to the best, most reliable information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The $2500 that we are raising will go towards the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing expenses-in order to get the word out, we must advertise! We’re looking to make our mark on the world through blogs and other websites. We need printed marketing supplies (business cards, flyers,  and mailers). We’ll also need to advertise toward our social media audience as well.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Blog and guest writers-Even bloggers have to eat!</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Possible guest appearances-We’ll be asking for leading experts to visit us for open chats.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative costs-shipping expenses, travel expenses, etc.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Our perks are simple! We figure that we have more time than money, so we’d be happy to use our talents to benefit you! Birth plan writing, customized website services, a personalized childbirth ed class, and Lactation Counseling services are what we can do for you by helping us to help others.</p>

<p>We believe that Peace on Earth begins at Birth. We can make a huge impact, together, by getting the most reliable, evidence based information to the parents that want it.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Cathi Locati and this is NIPPLELODEON!  I am CEO and  Areola Architect of Cathi Locati Co. in Westchester county, NY. The inspiration for this Indiegogo.com crowd funding campaign comes from the growing group of breast cancer survivors I work with daily, who are missing their nipples and areolas and who have no way to get them back without your help! As a professional fine artist and aerola tattoo artist, I want to give them something free of charge that they can not afford on their own and something very few artists in the world can give them: photorealistic areolas and nipples tattooed in 3D.  Together we can give 5 breast cancer survivors their sexy back!</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself, “What the heck is an areola anyway? What does it mean to be an Areola Architect?” Well, areolas are the circle of colored skin that rings the nipple. We all have them and  they  play a vital part in the aesthetic presentation of the breast on women or men. When breast cancer patients undergo breast cancer treatments or surgery, their main priority is to get rid of the cancer. Yet, once that is accomplished, they are left with scarred breasts or no breasts at all, and even after plastic surgery reconstruction, whatever IS left is often lacking nipples and areolas. These breast cancer survivors are grateful to be alive, but many of them don’t feel feminine anymore; that feeling that made them look and feel sexy. This is where I come in, the areola architect. I am highly specialized in tattooing photorealistic areolas and nipples in 3D in the style of Michaelangelo.  The areola and nipple tattoos are permanent and wont fade like 90% of  areola tattoos being done today by surgeons and tattoo artists alike.  </p>
<p>And this is where you come in!  Providing Areolas and nipples for 5 deserving, worthy women can NOT be done without YOUR help. We need to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of 5 areola and nipple procedures.  Every one of your donations acts like a stone thrown into a very still pond,  creating the ripple effect “or should I say  “nipple effect”” quickly growing the outreach to other Breast Cancer Survivors worldwide.  Wont you help me spread the good word and educate more women about their breasts and options for micropigmentation and watch the smiles grow, watch the sensual woman return. Together, we will  bring their sexy back!</p>
<p>But we need your help!</p>
<p>We set our goal at $10,000 to cover all costs but besides accepting monetary donations, we would love your social media help as well  in telling more BCS about their tattooing options.  Feel free to post, tweet, forward and tell everyone  you know, because unfortunately, everyone knows someone affected by breast cancer.  And because I deal with these brave women every day I agree that breast cancer is a whole lot more than a pink ribbon.</p>
<p>A small portion of funds raised are seed capital for Cathi Locati Co.  helping me pioneer this budding industry of areola tattooing or micropigmentation, exponentially increasing the education desperately needed about breasts in general, helping BCS know their rights and inform them about the simple, quick tattooing procedure which provides permanent color verses more surgery which cant provide permanent color, regardless of the technique.</p>
<p>So We’re turning to you, our strongest supporters for contributions to make this happen.</p>
<p>There are aesthetic perks for you too in return for helping these women get their areola tattoos free of charge, you will receive a myriad of fine art works by me, Cathi Locati to hang in your home or office or give as gifts.  These pieces come from my personal artist’s collection ranging from sketchwork, and original paintings to large format Giclee reproductions.  To see the photorealistic imagery offered as perks go to <a href=""http://www.cathilocati.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cathilocati.com</a> click on Early Works.</p>
<p>I have accumulated over 30 years experience as a photorealism portrait and figurative fine art painter where my work is seen all over the world and ranges in retail from $3000 - $125,000.  I’ve exhibited in Monaco in the French Riviera, New York City in Chelsea at Amsterdam Whitney Gallery, The NY Art Expo, all over the west coast, the Cayman Islands and beyond, I turn my fine artist photorealist savant tattooing skills to tattooing in 3D, so real they make you want to touch them, gorgeous, plump areolas and nipples in full living color. </p>
<p>When the breast cancer survivors that you helped look in the mirror, they will wipe away tears of joy, because in their shock and awe, when they see themselves for the very first time with areolas and nipples in full living color, they come back to life.  And they will thank you for it every day of their lives.  When you bring BCS back to the sensual side of being female, feeling like a sexy woman again,  it counts as your own personal pay it forward! </p>
<p>We can do this one nipple at a time when we exceed our Indiegogo goal of $!0,000 – for every additional $1000 raised over and above, another BCS gets her sexy back!  So many of them, so little time….</p>
<p>I also provide facial cosmetic tattoos for chemotherapy patients in the form of eyebrows, eyeliner and lips using the tattoo machine and my portrait abilities.</p>
<p>Check out my areola site at: <a href=""http://www.cathilocatico.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cathilocatico.com</a>.  Thank you for helping us pioneer a brand new industry and making life better one breast cancer survivor at a time – because each one counts.  Let’s welcome them back into the land of living color and hope!!</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","We are the only cow milk dairy on the island of Oahu and will soon be the first cow milk cheese production in the state of Hawaii EVER! We are aiming to create signature cheeses, made from milk from Hawaiian cows, that celebrate the flavors and terrain of our unique and beautiful islands. Some of the cheeses we are right now testing and working on perfecting include a soft young brie-type cheese, several styles of gouda including some made with local herbs and spices, and a kiawe (Hawaiian mesquite) smoked mozzarella type cheese! Soon, with your help, we can have these tasty beauties at the market and on your table!
The Impact
 
Hard Fact #1:  To achieve longed for stability as a family owned and operated agricultural business, Naked Cow Dairy direly needs to start making cheese!  By securing the waiting cheeselover market, this dairy will be able to thrive and grow.
Hard Fact  #2:  100% of cow milk cheese in Hawaii has been imported, some cheeses from more than 10,000 miles away.  Hawaii currently imports at least 80% of the food that we eat.  Let's put a dent in these numbers!

Semi-Soft Fact:  You will be helping Naked Cow Dairy make history by being the first cow milk cheese making operation in Hawaii.  

Soft, Spreadable Delicious Fact:  Imagine these cheeses made fresh, right here on the island with milk from pasture-raised cows: mozzarella, jack, cheddar, gouda, brie, camembert, and more! mmmmm.....

The Naked Cow Story and Vision
 
Naked Cow Dairy is a women-owned, family run cow dairy on the island of Oahu whose mission is to keep the art of caring for dairy cows alive and well in Hawaii and to bring Island-made, signature, local, fresh-churned butter and artisan cheeses to the table. Hand-crafted dairy products ensure the health and happiness of the cows as well as the high quality of the product.

Started by sisters Monique van der Stroom and Sabrina St. Martin, Naked Cow Dairy is a labor of love that fills a void left by the closure of 75 (!) dairies on Oahu in the past  50 years. 
Monique came to the decision to start Naked Cow after working in other dairies on Oahu and watching each of them struggle and fail to compete with the cheaper mainland imports. She realized that in order to be viable it would be necessary to maximize the potential of the milk by creating value added foods like butter, yogurt and cheese. 
Sabrina, after leaving New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina, came to the dairy with a vision to expand the culinary reach of the product to restaurant chefs passionate about locally produced food and farmer's market shoppers eager to support local farms.

 

What We Need & What You Get
 
This campaign’s goal is to raise $15,000 to equip our kitchen with a heating element for our 230 gallon cheese vat & low-temp pasteurizer. This part costs about $7000 to purchase and install. 
In addition we need to build and outfit a cheese aging room that will keep our delicious cheeses at the right temperature and humidity until they go to market. The equipment and buildout of the space we need is estimated to cost about $8000. 
With these parts of the puzzle in place we will be on the way to making Hawaii cheesy!!

As valued members of our food community your donations will be rewarded with awesome perks like your name in print on our cheese aging room “Wall O’ Moohalo” ! 
Or how about a one-of-a-kind cheese board on which to taste our fromage made from reclaimed Hawaiian hardwoods! 
Or bring the family to Hawaii and experience an incredible day on our Wai’anae farm, learning to make cheese, milk cows and enjoy a Wai’anae sunset with cheese in hand! 
Check out our “perks” to choose yours!

<p><strong>Help Susan Beat Cancer</strong><br/><br/>Many have asked how they can help Susan/Susie Hackett, our wonderful relation, friend and teacher.

<p><strong>9/16/12 Update:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Well the big wedding/frame-raising wave finally reached the shore, and rolled gently up onto the beach, rather than crashing hard.  Some friends stayed on here and helped put on the roof boards, and covered the whole structure with a rugged tarp to protect the frame until we get a proper roof on (see photo updates).  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>We only have 6 days left of this campaign, and we likely won't reach our goal, but what we have raised is nevertheless a huge help in getting us closer to a warm home.  Thanks to all who have contributed financially, physically, spiritually, or some combination thereof.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>As fall sets in, and the pressure of organizing the (for us) huge set of events two weeks ago has lifted, I've finally been finding some time for wandering and reflection.  Invariably I am drawn toward our house, and I often find myself just gazing at the frame, not entirely sure how it all came together, but so grateful that it did.  I can't thank you all enough for participating in what will no doubt stand out as a couple of the best days of our lives that we will remember vividly as long as we are around.<br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>We have established this fundraiser in an effort to channel enthusiasm and support for our marriage toward something we truly need.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If everything comes together as we hope it will, on September 2, 2012 we will raise our house frame with our family and friends.  It is such a powerful symbolic event---our loved ones helping to put our house together.   It occurred to us that our family and friends helping us to fund our masonry heater would also be symbolic, helping to bring light and warmth into the very center of our home.  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>For those of unfamiliar with masonry heaters, they are a very different way of heating with wood than we are accustomed to in the U.S.  A very hot fire is made that burns for perhaps an hour and a half.  But instead of all of the heat rushing up the chimney, as with fireplaces and wood stoves, the hot gases move through a series of channels, heating up all the brick in the process (including, in our case, an oven and 2 heated benches).   The masonry soaks up most of the heat, and releases it slowly for many hours.  In the coldest weather, we will probably only need 2 fires per day.  Masonry heaters burn very cleanly, and very efficiently.  There are no moving parts, and only require being cleaned of ash occasionally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We have also included a masonry cookstove in our plans, which will enable us to cook all winter using wood, at the same time heating water for dishes, bathing, and, eventually, our commercial goat cheese creamery, all with wood from our forest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This heater/cookstove unit represents about a third of the total budget of our house.  Though the initial cost is quite high, it is an investment that should give returns through generations of Maine winters.  They are designed to last, and where they have been used for centuries, they have lasted well.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The most expensive aspect of this project is the cast iron and tempered glass elements (fire door, oven door, cooktop, etc.), which are imported from Finland, where masonry stoves are very common.  To have this built for us would cost somewhere around $25,000.  For us to do it ourselves it will be more like $15,000.  We have set our goal lower to be realistic and make it achievable. <br/></strong></p>

Well our hearth may still only be a vision on paper and in chalk lines, but it is so much closer to reality now…
 Thanks to the huge community effort to raise the house frame, we now have a space in which to locate the heart of our home, and thanks to the generous contributions to this campaign, it is all the more financially feasible.
 This is how the house will sit for some weeks, as I reluctantly prepare to depart to Connecticut for work, and Briis for New Jersey, at a time of year that is so clear and pristine it nearly stops your heart…. But what a wonderful stage at which to leave, married to a wonderful woman, a beautiful house standing, and the echoes of that amazing weekend still strong…
 Thanks again for all who contributed in so many ways. We will have pictures of the wedding and frame raising available soon! And as the heater starts to materialize (next spring) we will keep you all posted. By then, if all goes to plan, we will have walls, windows, doors, and the beginnings of a roof. 
 We aim to move in by next winter, so be prepared for a house-warming party, in the fullest sense!
 
Much love, peace, and respect to you all, and...

9/16/12 Update:
Well the big wedding/frame-raising wave finally reached the shore, and rolled gently up onto the beach, rather than crashing hard.  Some friends stayed on here and helped put on the roof boards, and covered the whole structure with a rugged tarp to protect the frame until we get a proper roof on (see photo updates).  
We only have 6 days left of this campaign, and we likely won't reach our goal, but what we have raised is nevertheless a huge help in getting us closer to a warm home.  Thanks to all who have contributed financially, physically, spiritually, or some combination thereof.
As fall sets in, and the pressure of organizing the (for us) huge set of events two weeks ago has lifted, I've finally been finding some time for wandering and reflection.  Invariably I am drawn toward our house, and I often find myself just gazing at the frame, not entirely sure how it all came together, but so grateful that it did.  I can't thank you all enough for participating in what will no doubt stand out as a couple of the best days of our lives that we will remember vividly as long as we are around.

<p><span>Our monastery (home) is
situated in Villanova Mondovi (Cuneo, Italy), while our foreign mission houses
are in Romania (Oradea, Butea and Scheia) and Ecuador (Loja). </span></p>
<p><span>Now we are writing to you from
Butea and Scheia, which represent two different realities, but inseparable
because they both try to face the problems which are affecting this community:
poverty and alcohol.  </span></p>
<p><span>Many families live in terrible
conditions, both regarding dwelling, but also hygiene.  </span></p>
<p><span>The employment opportunities
and, therefore economic ones are non-existing; the people are trying to survive
by raising animals and farming a piece of land.</span></p>
<p><span>Winter is the most difficult
time of the year, because the temperature goes to -20 or – 23 degrees Celsius
and not all the inhabitants can buy fire wood to keep them warm. This affects
mostly old people and children as young people try to improve their living and
they immigrate, abandoning children and parents, often leaving without a trace.
</span></p>
<p><span>We have been staying here for
14 years, working especially for the needy.  </span></p>
<p><span><b>Our activities in Romania:</b></span></p>

<p><span>Has been created in 2004 for helping children with
serious family problems or those abandoned by their parents, forced by great
poverty to immigrate. At first the structure allowed only girls in, but in
order to satisfy the received requirements and not to separate brothers and
sisters, very close to each other and already traumatized by their parents'
separation, little by little we also accepted boys. We are trying to give moral
and also material support to all ""our"" children, in ""an
environment as quiet as possible"".   <span>Our wish is to offer
them affection and education, to ease the pain they carry in their soul,
however we will try to teach them to take care of smaller children and to visit
old people because we believe that it is important for them to grow up taking
care of those around them. </span></span></p>
<p><span>We are trying, to the allowed extent,
to improve the relations with their natural families.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE HOME OF
THE OLD AND THE SICK</b></p>
<p> <span>It is a home that can host
approximately 42 people. Unfortunately we cannot
satisfy all the requirements we receive every day, but the house is always
full.   </span></p>
<p><span>In Italy, the homes for old
people usually host persons over 70-75 years, in Romania the physical decay
comes much earlier, due to the hard work in the field, the difficult hygiene
and sanitary conditions and the alcohol which continues to be a serious problem
for this country.  Our program includes a
physical (physical therapy), psychological, mental and moral recovery. Together
with the children from the House of Mother Carla's Family and with those from
the country side we often organize plays, concerts and dances to offer them a
smile and to make them feel less the burden of sickness and old age. </span></p>
<p><b><span>THE MEDICAL CENTRE</span></b></p>
<p><span>The Medical Centre is offering
the possibility, to those in need and especially to poor families, to benefit
from a medical examination performed by specialists in gynecology, cardiology,
ultrasound, physiotherapy, ophthalmology, neurology, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>With an ambulance (donated by
Italy) we provide transportation to the hospital (which is at a distance of
approximately 70 km).</span></p>
<p><span>Since starting the mission in
Butea we have offered home care to the sick and the old; as most of them are
alone, their children having migrated in search of a job. </span></p><p>Together with the pastoral life of the parish we are educating young people from the country side to be generous and to visit the poor children and the old and sick people from Butea.</p><p>Every day children, old people and entire families come to our monastery to ask for food, clothing, teaching materials and medicines. </p><p><b>NEW PROJECT: Scheia, 8 km away from Butea</b> </p><p>We want to bring to your attention a new project, meant to help the young people who are the slaves of alcohol, a problem which has destroyed many families from this country. </p><p>The severe regime Romania had to endure left many wounds in peoples' hearts.

<p>AJ was working 2nd shift as a facility supervisor when he fell through a poorly constructed mezzanine (over 10ft to a cement floor) and destroyed two discs in his spinal column. He has been out of work since 2010 due to the severity of this injury.</p>
<p>I (and many of you) have been blessed with being one of AJs friends. He is one of the most caring, honest, hard working, multi-talented and dedicated people I know. Since the accident it seems that life does not want to give him a break. Not only has this injury caused physical damage, but it has been an emotional and financial struggle as well.</p>
<p>All the money we raise will go directly to AJ to cover his medical and recovery expenses; we will literally be helping him “get back on his feet again”.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></h2>
<p>The goal of “Aiding-AJ” is to raise $1,000 (or more!) to cover post-op expenses like mobility equipment, medications and first aid supplies, doctor/lawyer fees, even gas money for trips to-and-from physical therapy. AJ will be in recovery for 3 months, maybe more, and even after that there is still only a 60% chance that this surgery will be a long term success.</p>
<p>If you can’t give a monetary donation, just spreading the word will help! Or you can help us by giving “perks” to help raise funds, whether it be your time, talent, or treasure. Please contact me (Chris) for how you can help! Some examples of what you’ll get if you donate:</p>
<p>-Signed thank you card with photo of AJ in his hospital bed, and Lurch in a nurse outfit</p>
<p>-A signed CD of Dark Days Here by AJs band In The Red</p>
<p>-Your name will be included in the album cover of next printing of Dark Days Here</p>
<p>-Significant donations will get you (2) hours of DJ entertainment for a private party hosted by <span>Do It Up Productions DJ &amp; Karaoke Services</span>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>About AJ:</strong></h2>
<p><em>“The accident happened in August 2009 when I fell through the floor of the mezzanine and fell 10ft onto a concert floor and landed on my back. I was out for a month, but it started to show in May 2010. I was at work on my computer and got up and something popped in my lower back. It felt like electricity was shooting down my spine and down my legs, I couldn't move. I went to talk to my doctor and he ordered my original MRI and that's what it came up with [herniated discs]. The result was determined from my original accident. I did physical therapy, spinal injections, pain medications, and nothing helped make it better. So now they want to try this procedure hoping it helps and I won't have to come back anytime soon for a fusion or artificial discs” - AJ</em></p>

<p>A.J. has been singing his entire life; it runs in his family. His father being the lead singer in the church choir and his sister was also blessed with a beautiful voice. A.J. and his sister sang for the youth choir at church every week when he was a teenager, but he was always into heavier music. His influences are Alice in Chains, Staind, Cold, Stone Sour, Slipknot, Disturbed, Korn, Killswitch Engage, and Parkway Drive. A.J. was in a few bands but they never really got where he wanted. So to fulfill his music needs he started going to karaoke nights every week and just kept singing. Constantly getting compliments about his voice and people saying he should go on American Idol, A.J. just kept true to himself and his music.

Music that can help them out with their problems, or even just to get them through the day.</p></div>","About Aiding-AJ:
AJ was working 2nd shift as a facility supervisor when he fell through a poorly constructed mezzanine (over 10ft to a cement floor) and destroyed two discs in his spinal column. He has been out of work since 2010 due to the severity of this injury.
I (and many of you) have been blessed with being one of AJs friends. He is one of the most caring, honest, hard working, multi-talented and dedicated people I know. Since the accident it seems that life does not want to give him a break. Not only has this injury caused physical damage, but it has been an emotional and financial struggle as well.
All the money we raise will go directly to AJ to cover his medical and recovery expenses; we will literally be helping him “get back on his feet again”.
What We Need & What You Get:
The goal of “Aiding-AJ” is to raise $1,000 (or more!) to cover post-op expenses like mobility equipment, medications and first aid supplies, doctor/lawyer fees, even gas money for trips to-and-from physical therapy. AJ will be in recovery for 3 months, maybe more, and even after that there is still only a 60% chance that this surgery will be a long term success.
If you can’t give a monetary donation, just spreading the word will help! Or you can help us by giving “perks” to help raise funds, whether it be your time, talent, or treasure. Please contact me (Chris) for how you can help! Some examples of what you’ll get if you donate:
-Signed thank you card with photo of AJ in his hospital bed, and Lurch in a nurse outfit
-A signed CD of Dark Days Here by AJs band In The Red
-Your name will be included in the album cover of next printing of Dark Days Here
-Significant donations will get you (2) hours of DJ entertainment for a private party hosted by Do It Up Productions DJ & Karaoke Services!
 
About AJ:
“The accident happened in August 2009 when I fell through the floor of the mezzanine and fell 10ft onto a concert floor and landed on my back. I was out for a month, but it started to show in May 2010. I was at work on my computer and got up and something popped in my lower back. It felt like electricity was shooting down my spine and down my legs, I couldn't move. I went to talk to my doctor and he ordered my original MRI and that's what it came up with [herniated discs]. The result was determined from my original accident. I did physical therapy, spinal injections, pain medications, and nothing helped make it better. So now they want to try this procedure hoping it helps and I won't have to come back anytime soon for a fusion or artificial discs” - AJ

A.J. has been singing his entire life; it runs in his family. His father being the lead singer in the church choir and his sister was also blessed with a beautiful voice. A.J. and his sister sang for the youth choir at church every week when he was a teenager, but he was always into heavier music. His influences are Alice in Chains, Staind, Cold, Stone Sour, Slipknot, Disturbed, Korn, Killswitch Engage, and Parkway Drive. A.J. was in a few bands but they never really got where he wanted. So to fulfill his music needs he started going to karaoke nights every week and just kept singing. Constantly getting compliments about his voice and people saying he should go on American Idol, A.J. just kept true to himself and his music. After replying to an add from Pete Rizzo of ""In the Red"" about an audition for the lead singer, A.J. went to the audition and got the position for the band the first night!

<b>Jiggers (Deworming)
     Campaign: </b>Jiggers is a skin
     disease caused by the ‘jigger flea’, which is found in tropical regions
     around the world. The disease itself is relatively easily treated, but
     because it is the by-product of a multitude of other factors (socio-economic
     status, education, etc), it is generally overlooked by major development
     agencies. Locals in Kenya called it a ‘disease of poverty’. Without
     treatment, individuals who are heavily infested suffer from malnutrition,
     and the open sores can lead to gangrene, tetanus, and death. In 2013, SID
     ran a jiggers campaign to treat those in the community suffering from
     jiggers; beyond treatment, SID conducted education and cleaned/fumigated
     houses in the hopes of creating a more lasting impact. This year, SID is
     looking to continue but also expand on the work done last year, and in
     particular look to develop initiates that the community can sustain on its
     own throughout the year. </li>
<li>
<b>Public health
     camps:</b> Access to
     care in Kenya is limited for many due to financial constraints. For many,
     the ability to have basic and primary healthcare is beyond their means.
     Public health camps provide a segway into the health system, giving people
     a point of access to otherwise unaffordable care. Public health camps aim
     to provide those in the community with basic treatment; each year, <b>SID

<p>Hello, My name is Linda Joffe. I am the founder of an all-natural 
vegan-friendly skincare line, which I proudly call Devera Naturals. My 
friends say I'm ambitious, tenacious, and a lover of all things fashion 
and beauty related. My husband says I have a wonderful sense of balance

<h3>The Catalyst for Devera Naturals<br/>
</h3>
<p>My quest for truly natural beauty products began with a diagnosis of breast cancer in June of 2004. While battling cancer and chemotherapy, I coped with a variety of side effects including hair loss, dry patchy skin and considerable weight loss. It was a struggle to feel beautiful especially when the beauty products I used to love contained chemicals and parabens which were harmful to my body. This led me to the creation and launch of Devera Naturals skincare line in 2006. Not only are my products  100% natural, they are made with cutting edge natural ingredients, such as plant stem cells and goji berry extract, with proven results.</p>

By backing this campaign you are helping an established boutique brand to grow. We currently have the capabilities to fulfill all orders coming from this campaign, so the only risk is that we don't get enough attention to bring our products to a store near you.




  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute to our cause, that doesn't mean you can't help! It would be greatly appreciated if you follow and interact with our social media accounts (@DeveraNaturals on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook). You can do this by sharing, commenting, and liking our posts or creating your own posts and tagging us! We want you to help us make some noise about our campaign. You can also utilize the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>These groups of suffering survivors

<p>19 Years ago, when I was just
14 years old, I had a stroke that required brain surgery to stop the bleeding
and save my life.  It took months of
therapy to learn to talk, read, and write again, and eventually to miraculously
walk again.  Then, 10 Years ago, while I
was 8-1/2 months pregnant I suffered another stroke, this one leaving me with
complete numbness and almost no control of the right side of my body, robbing
me of the use of my arm and hand.  I
suffered from crippling pain, cognitive disabilities, and depression over what
I had become and what I could no longer do. 
Finally, after nearly 9 years of suffering, I decided it was time to
fight back. I threw down the cane I had been walking with and stepped outside,
forcing myself through the slowest jog ever. 
The next day I did it again, and over a few months I eventually trained
myself to run.  I have a limp, struggle immensely,
and I’m not very fast, but more importantly I no longer let my disabilities
hold me back.  Now I use my past and what
I’ve overcome as motivation to help others with their struggles, in particular
a sweetheart named Dominic, whom I’ve never even actually met.</p>
<p><b><u>A Special Little Boy</u></b></p>
<p>8 Years ago, Dominic was
born with Cerebral Palsy.  He is unable
to walk, talk, or eat on his own, and has very little control of his body.  With no real form of communication, it can be
nearly impossible to understand what Dominic’s thinking or feeling at any given
time.  Relying on his mother and family
for everything, Dominic’s life is hard to comprehend.  Still though, his spirit is strong and his
smile can be outright infectious, making it clear that despite his many medical
issues this is still a little boy both capable and deserving of love and
everything else other little boys enjoy.</p>
<p><b><u>Dominic’s Wish</u></b></p>
<p>Nearly 1 year ago, Dominic’s
mom signed him up with the IRun4 non-profit organization, matching him with a
runner who would write to him and dedicate all their miles run to him since he
cannot run himself.  That runner is
me.  Having a major medical history of my
own, I was deeply touched by Dominic’s story and felt a connection through his
smile.  My family and Dominic’s have been
in constant contact- I have been chatting, sending mementos of runs and other
gifts, and dedicating hundreds of miles to him, including 5K, 10K, and
half-marathon races.  Recently, Dominic’s
family and I were contacted by My Team Triumph, a non-profit organization that
allows the disabled opportunities to participate in official race events, using
specialized chairs and able-runners pushing them the entire distance.  We have officially been invited to be members
of their team in the Las Vegas Rock N’ Roll Half-Marathon this November.  This is truly an amazing opportunity to
connect face-to-face for a life-changing experience, over 13.1 miles that will
surely be full of smiles, tears, and indescribable joy.  Seeing his face when his mom talks about our
families meeting and about running with “Ms. Krissy” is absolutely amazing- he
truly lights up at the thought.  I have suffered
devastating medical issues, I know what it means to be told what you can’t do,
and I have felt the wonder and joy of accomplishing and experiencing those things…
to be able to give Dominic that kind of experience and those feelings would be a
real blessing.  To do that that though, I
need your help.</p>
<p><b><u>Your help</u></b></p>
<p>Having medical issues and a
family of my own, unfortunately I can’t afford the costs involved in this
amazing opportunity. That’s why I’m asking for your kindness and generosity to
help me get to Dominic and push him through this race.  I have set our target fundraising goal at
$1000, but to make this dream come true in total we actually need to come up
with $2095 ($1795 for travel and lodging, $300 for race entry fees.)  100% of the funds raised will go directly
toward covering these expenses and providing Dominic with priceless memories.  Not only will your support help make this
dream come true, but it will provide Dominic as well as me and my family with
precious memories for the rest of our lives. As a heart-felt thank you and show
of appreciation I will also be sending meaningful, personal perks to you for
your help. </p>
<p>Please help donate whatever
you can- no amount is too small or big when it’s going toward such an amazing
cause.  Also, whether you are able to
donate or not, please share this with your friends and family over Facebook and
other social media, and leave us comments here to help us reach others.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your
time and your help, have a happy, healthy day.</p>
<p>God Bless, <br/>

The surgeon was able to get about 95% of the tumor. The remaining 5% is on the brain stem.

</h3><p>We have health insurance but the only cancer treatment options covered by insurance is surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Nate had surgery already but radiation and chemotherapy are not options for him. So, all of our treatments for Nate since he left the hospital are paid out of pocket. The ongoing maintenance is $3K/month and things are moving in the right direction with these treatments but we could be fighting this cancer a lot more aggressively if we are able to treat Nate at home and get him IV Nutritional Therapy. Here is how we will spend the money raised with this campaign:<br/></p><ul>
<li>First $30,000 - Bio-electrical medical equipment so Nate can get daily treatments for the ependymoma, the encephalitis virus, as well as his damaged cranial nerves.</li>
<li>Next $6,000 - Three IV Nutritional Therapy sessions (each 2-day session costs $2K)<br/>
</li>
<li>Next $48,000 - to be applied towards on-going herbal, enzyme, weekly acupuncture and bi-weekly advanced energy treatments. Nate's treatments are expected to be needed until July 2015 at a rate of $3K/month.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>Cancer is dangerous. The treatment course we've chosen has helped build Nate's immune system to the point where it is able to slowly beat the cancer.

cost, long before anatomical changes occur. Unlike mammograms that screen only
for breast cancer by detecting an anatomical anomaly, this new technology is
designed to detect much smaller anomalies in biological processes through use
of a low-radiation, complete body screening. <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMnHRuWo4o"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></b>

<p>One
person dies every 5 seconds from cancer somewhere in the world.  It is
indiscriminate when choosing its victims. It strikes the powerful and the
famous, the rich and the poor, the young and the old.</p>
<p>We
launch this project to raise funds to make the 3D-CBS breakthrough early cancer
detection technology available with an invention by research scientist Dario
Crosetto, described below.</p>
<p><b>Act now!</b>Support this exceptional project that will revolutionize
the medical field by changing the direction of the current approach to early
cancer detection. By contributing to this project you can be part of
this unique solution that is designed to detect cancer much earlier than
existing technology.</p>
<p><b><u>What is lacking to
solve the cancer problem?</u></b></p>
<p>One
of the most serious problems facing medicine is late detection of cancer.
Experimental data from several official sources agree that the earlier cancer
is detected, the <b>greater the <a href=""http://links.unitedtoendcancer.info/doc2/233.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">survival </a>rate </b>(in
most cases 90% to 98%).<b> What is lacking is a screening method that is
effective for early cancer detection.</b> It needs to be rapid, sensitive,
inexpensive, safe and effective in early detection of all types of cancer in
all organs of the body. An effective screening method should use a device that
is efficient in <b>detecting,</b> at a low cost, reliable <b>signals</b>
showing the <b>beginning of a mutation</b> from normal cells into cancerous
cells.</p>
<p><b><u>A breakthrough
technology for solving the problem of cancer</u></b></p>
<p>Three-Dimensional
Complete Body Screening (3D-CBS) technology makes it possible to build a
medical imaging device that fits the above requirements. The 3D-CBS examination
is designed to be: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>rapid (duration<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[18]</span></span></a>
of the examination will be approximately 4 minutes), </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>sensitive, </p>
<p>·<span>

<p>·<span> 
</span><b><a href=""http://links.unitedtoendcancer.info/doc2/310.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">effective</a></b>
at detecting cancer and other diseases in all organs of the body at an early,
curable stage; </p>

</span>administering a safe dose of radiation, permitting annual usage,</p>

after five hours of public scrutiny (worldwide via internet) from the

<p><b><u>A frequent comment
from the public  </u></b></p>
<p><b>Comment:</b>
“It is clear at this point that a greater survival rate can be obtained by
detecting more accurately, more signals from the tumor markers, but why is it
better than detecting another signal showing a change in odor, temperature,
fluorescence, conductivity, or tissue density using X-ray, CT scan, MRI,
Ultrasound, etc.?”</p>
<p><b>Response:</b> 
“There are thousands of articles reporting that experimental results show that
cancer cells grow faster than normal cells and because they grows faster, they require
more nutrient, up to 70 times more than normal cells. Abnormal metabolism is an
important signal related to the start of the mutation from normal cells into cancerous
cells. Capturing more signals more accurately from tumor markers showing
abnormal consumption of nutrient from body cells could provide advantages in
early cancer detection. There are no similar advantages from other signals.” </p>
<p><b>Follow
up comment:</b> “I understand, and it makes sense! I want to have an exam like
this.  <b>If a low cost screening of the entire body for all types of cancer in
patients without symptoms but, at high risk, can be done effectively </b>(capturing
the majority of signals from any tumor markers combined with a radioisotope) <b>with
the 3D-CBS technology,</b> <b>requiring a low level of radiation dose,

<p><b>The
3D-CBS technology: </b>The 3D-CBS technology relies on the same nuclear
reaction as current PET, however, it is unlike the 5,000 existing PET devices that
do not capture most of the radiation. This is because they scan only a portion
of the body and can only measure the dimensions of already-formed tumors. The
3D-CBS technology is designed for a cost-effective Complete Body Screening exam.
It measures minimum abnormal consumption of nutrient by body cells or by
detecting other anomalies, <b>and is thus designed to achieve an effective
early cancer detection.</b> (<a href=""http://links.unitedtoendcancer.info/doc2/400.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read more...)</a></p>

<p><b>The
inventor, Dario Crosetto: </b>Crosetto worked as a research scientist on
physics experiments at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, for 17 years before joining
the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project in Texas  in 1991 where he
currently resides.  He lectured at CERN School of Computing, and has published
six books and 100+ articles. Crosetto received grants from the Department of
Defense and the Department of Energy for approximately $1 million to pursue
research in pattern recognition that breaks the speed barrier in real-time
applications. In the course of his research, he realized that his technology
could be utilized to detect a different type of matter: <u>cancer cells</u>. He
then developed and patented the 3-D Complete Body screening technology as the
first step toward creating early cancer-detection devices designed to be more
effective than current technology.</p>
<p>He
holds seven patents for the 3-D complete Body Screening technology. His goal is
to make this technology a reality and seek to develop devices to help stop
cancer through early detection. Crosetto has committed to donating the majority
of the income from licensing his patents to provide free screening with an
effective 3D-CBS device to low-income patients. (You can find additional

Crosetto’s effort to increase PET efficiency has been translated in a study
based on his innovative 3D-CBS technology (see <a href=""http://links.unitedtoendcancer.info/doc2/431.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://links.unitedtoendcancer.info/doc2/431.pdf</a>).
He presented a plan (see <a href=""http://www.u2ec.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.u2ec.org</a>) to
build three prototypes to be tested on a sample population aged 50-75 in a
location with a constant death rate over the past 20 years. The advantages of
his innovative 3D-CBS technology, his plan to build three prototypes and test
them on a sample population, providing the benefits of reducing cancer deaths
and cost have been discussed in several public forums. No one has been able to
invalidate with scientific arguments Crosetto’s claim that his invention would
greatly reduce premature cancer deaths and cost. Therefore, funding should be
provided to implement 3D-CBS prototypes instead of funding less efficient
projects that did not go through this public scientific procedure. A difference
or no difference in the mortality rate will quantify the success or failure of
his proposed solution. </p>

<p>

<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[9]</span></span></a> A physician
could receive precious information from instrumentations and make a correct
diagnosis to avoid false positives and false negatives when the technique
behind each instrument is understood and developed to its full potential.
Positron Emission Technique works best when providing information of the
slightest abnormal metabolic activity (consumption of nutrient, growth, and for
showing other abnormal biological processes tagged by a radionuclide) that other
techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), X-ray, etc., cannot provide. <b>This is what a physician should
expect, request and focus</b> <b>on a PET technique: </b>an instrument that
precisely measures the slightest abnormal metabolism. It would be an
inappropriate use of PET to measure dimensions and CT to measure activities of
biological processes at the molecular level, as by analogy it would be
inappropriate to use a water meter to measure dimensions and a ruler to measure
monthly water consumption. The 3D-CBS develops this technique to its potential
in a cost-effective instrument that provides the maximum efficiency in
accurately detecting all possible signals from the tumor markers at the lowest
cost per valid signal captured. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[10]</span></span></span></a> It is improper for physicians, oncologists, hospital
administrators, etc., to ask PET manufacturers: “What is the spatial resolution
of your PET?” instead of asking: “What is the accuracy of your PET in detecting
the slightest abnormality in a specific biological process tagged with a
radionuclide?”  They do not ask what the spatial resolution is of a heart
monitor rate device or of an electric kWh meter, because they relate the
technique used by the instrument to perform the measurement with the
information they expect from the instrument. Therefore, it is inappropriate to
ask PET manufacturers to increase the spatial resolution of a device whose
technique features an inherent error that can be of several mm due to two
natural phenomena that cannot be eliminated.  Actually, the tumor can be at a
distance of several millimeters from where it appears to be from the image, and
could show a significant dimensional error. This is because each positron,
originating in the tumor, travels before encountering an electron and then
annihilates generating two photons that will be detected by the PET. The
distance travelled is called “<u>positron range</u>” and depends on the
radionuclide used (it is 13.8 mm for Rubidium; 82, 4.5 mm for Oxygen-15, etc.).
The second source of error is <u>the “collinearity error”</u>: the photons
generated do not diverge at exactly 180°; the difference in their angle when
projected on the crystal detectors generates an extra error of up to ~ 1.5 mm.
Physicians, oncologists and hospital administrators, instead of insisting with
PET manufacturers to increase spatial resolution, they should ask for an
improvement in the accuracy of measuring the slightest abnormal biological
process activity. This would provide important information that they were not
aware was possible (beyond their imagination) that would contribute to a more
accurate diagnosis. It is important for physicians, oncologists and hospital
administrators to better understand the physics on which the instrument rely.
By doing so they can ask for useful information that the instrument can provide
and not ask for an improvement in the measurement of parameters within the
limitations of the technique used by the instrument that will not be helpful in
making a more precise diagnosis aimed at saving a patient’s life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[11]</span></span></a> The 3D-CBS is
designed to be effective for early cancer detection because it is efficient,
safe and has a low examination cost. These features are achieved because the
3D-CBS is designed to accurately capture all possible signals from the tumor
markers at the lowest cost per valid signal captured. High efficiency allows:
(a) the detection of minimum abnormal metabolism which is a reason to suspect
cancer cells as they consume up to 70 times more nutrient than normal cells (b)
requires a safe, low radiation dose (0.5% mSv, 1/30 of the dose required by
current PET and 50% less than 1 mSv which is the maximum dose for screening
recommended by the International Commission for Radiation Protection –ICRP-)
and (c) a low examination cost because of the higher patient throughput given
the fact that the 3D-CBS can collect more valid data in a shorter time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[12]</span></span></a> Efficiency is
defined as the number of 511 keV pairs of photons detected by the device
divided by the number of 511 keV pairs of photons generated by the annihilation
of a positron with an electron.</p>
<p>  The
efficiency of the 3D-CBS is “Very High” because the Field Of View (FOV) of the
3D-CBS is much longer (140 cm vs. 16-18 cm of current PET),  therefore the
3D-CBS will capture significantly more pairs of photons because their number is
approximately proportional to the square of the increase in length of the
detector. In addition, the efficiency of the 3D-CBS is also increased (a) by
the 3D-Flow parallel-processing system capable of accurately capturing as many
signals as possible from the tumor markers, (b) by the simplified, detector
assembly and (c) by its capability to execute 3 x 3, or 4 x 4 real-time complex
algorithms for a duration longer than the time interval between two consecutive
input data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[13]</span></span></a> Current PET
are not suitable for early cancer detection because of their low efficiency,
high radiation requirement that makes it hazardous for screening, and a high
examination cost. Capturing insufficient signals from the tumor markers does
not allow for early detection. Current PET can see an anomaly in cell
metabolism only when the tumor is large or very active at an advance stage.
Tumors detected at an advanced stage have a much lower probability to be cured
and save patient’s life. Current PET devices require over 10 times the maximum
radiation dose recommended by ICRP, thus not permitted for screening. The
examination cost is high because patients’ throughput is low due to the fact
that a longer time is needed to acquire sufficient data for reliable statistics
that would avoid “false positives” and “false negatives”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[14]</span></span></a> The
efficiency of the existing PET devices (GE, Philips and Siemens) is “Very Low”
because the Field Of View (FOV) is only 16 to 18 cm. This statement is very simple
to be verified in any hospital or clinic that utilizes a PET. You may ask the
PET operator how many valid pairs of 511 keV signals from tumor markers its PET
is able to record per second during a specific examination. The total number of
pairs of 511keV tumor marker signals generated per second depends on the dose
of radionuclide administered to the patient; 10 mCi of radionuclide (the
average amount of radionuclide per examination used for current PET) generates
370 million pairs per second. The EFFICIENCY for any specific PET device can be
calculated by dividing the number of valid 511 keV pairs of signals captured by
the total number of pairs generated by the radionuclide.</p>

Crosetto’s 3D-CBS technology is the first, true “total-body” PET system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[17]</span></span></a> Current PET
although they might be called Whole-Body PET are not TRUE TOTAL BODY because
their detector length is only approximately 16 cm to 18 cm. They are unable to
detect most of the oblique signals generated from the tumor markers. This
limitation does not allow all three advantages that make early cancer detection
effective: (a) high efficiency, (b) a low, safe radiation dose and (c) a low
examination cost.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[18]</span></span></a> The
examination duration must allow for the capture of enough data to form reliable
statistics for different parts of the body showing the slightest abnormal
metabolism. The 3D-CBS can capture hundreds of times more data per second
compared to current PET. This is because the 3D-CBS captures signals from tumor
markers all at once from the entire body lying in a stationary position with a
detector that is 140 cm long. The current PET is missing signals from the tumor
markers arriving at an angle because the detector is only 16 cm in length. This
requires positioning the detector on eleven different parts of the body. The
specifications of GE Discovery PET/CT 710 states that the duration of the
examination should be the “physician’s preference”. His preference should allow
enough data to be acquired and therefore avoid “false positives” and “false
negatives.” In order to obtain comparable statistical data, the duration of the
examination on current PET should be hundreds of times longer than the 3D-CBS
examination, which captures hundreds of times more signals per second. This
would be impractical, not only for the difficulty and discomfort to remain
still for several hours, but also because the radionuclide would cease
activity. It is reasonable to expect the examination time for the current PET
to last at least ten times longer than the 3D-CBS (40 minutes vs. 4 minutes) in
order to provide reliable information to reject at least “false positives” and
“false negatives”. However, unlike the 3D-CBS, the acquired data by the current
PET would still not provide enough information to make early cancer detection
possible. The values in this table do not match those indicated by the
manufacturers, however, it would be appropriate for each physician to adopt the
suggested 40 minute examination time for GE Discovery PET/CT 710 and Siemens
Biograph TruePoint having a detector length of ~ 16 cm, and 35 minutes for
Philips Gemini LXL that has a detector length of 18 cm</p>

WHAT IS
THE 3D-CBS?




WHAT IS
THE 3D-CBS?
The 3D-CBS is a patented technology designed
to a use low level of radiation at a very low cost to drastically improve early
cancer detection. 
It
is based on an invention
designed to accurately capture as many signals as possible from radiation at
the lowest cost per valid signal captured.
It
uses technology designed to accurately detect small anomalies in biological
processes in all organs of the human body, at a projected, low examination
cost, long before anatomical changes occur. Unlike mammograms that screen only
for breast cancer by detecting an anatomical anomaly, this new technology is
designed to detect much smaller anomalies in biological processes through use
of a low-radiation, complete body screening.

ROLLOUT PLAN




One
person dies every 5 seconds from cancer somewhere in the world.  It is
indiscriminate when choosing its victims. It strikes the powerful and the
famous, the rich and the poor, the young and the old.
We
launch this project to raise funds to make the 3D-CBS breakthrough early cancer
detection technology available with an invention by research scientist Dario
Crosetto, described below.
Act now!Support this exceptional project that will revolutionize
the medical field by changing the direction of the current approach to early
cancer detection. By contributing to this project you can be part of
this unique solution that is designed to detect cancer much earlier than
existing technology.
What is lacking to
solve the cancer problem?
One
of the most serious problems facing medicine is late detection of cancer.
Experimental data from several official sources agree that the earlier cancer
is detected, the greater the survival rate (in
most cases 90% to 98%). What is lacking is a screening method that is
effective for early cancer detection. It needs to be rapid, sensitive,
inexpensive, safe and effective in early detection of all types of cancer in
all organs of the body. An effective screening method should use a device that
is efficient in detecting, at a low cost, reliable signals
showing the beginning of a mutation from normal cells into cancerous
cells.
A breakthrough
technology for solving the problem of cancer
Three-Dimensional
Complete Body Screening (3D-CBS) technology makes it possible to build a
medical imaging device that fits the above requirements. The 3D-CBS examination
is designed to be: 
· 
rapid (duration[18]
of the examination will be approximately 4 minutes), 
· 
sensitive, 
· 
inexpensive, 
· 
effective
at detecting cancer and other diseases in all organs of the body at an early,
curable stage; 
· 
administering a safe dose of radiation, permitting annual usage,
· 
an improvement of the image quality, 
· 
cost-effective to patients and their insurance company,
· 
changing the clinical character of Positron Emission Tomography
(PET) into a preventive one, for use in early detection of cancer and other
common diseases.

The inventor
Dario Crosetto invented a technology that
has been recognized
by top scientists and experts from FERMIlab (U.S.), CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,
Universities and industries in a formal, major, public scientific review held
at FERMIlab that makes possible the discovery of new subatomic particles by
thoroughly analyzing over 600 million events per second. This invention when applied to the
field of medicine (when radiation is combined with tumor markers) offers a new
weapon (the 3D-CBS) in the fight against cancer. Crosetto holds seven patents[19] core to the
3D-CBS technology. The key parts of his inventions have been built in
functional modular hardware
that can easily migrate to future technologies.
What the inventor brings
to the table to solve the cancer problem:


His documentation for over 20 years,showing
     that he has been serving the scientific truth for the benefit of mankind. 

His commitment to continue to serve you
     in submitting pertinent and legitimate technical questions to decision
     makers that are in your best interest and work together to fulfill their
     responsibilities of the mandate that they received from you. (Read more...)

The benefits from his inventions previously
     described in this document.

The proof that he put you before any
     personal gain for himself. (Read more...)

Eighty per cent from the income from
     licensing the patents of his invention to benefit humanity will be donated
     to fund programs that will reduce cancer deaths and costs and provide free
     3D-CBS examinations for low-income patients.








BREAKTHROUGH INVENTION. The only one
demonstrating going “Beyond Imagination of Future Science”, in the discovery of new subatomic particles
and also in providing a significant leap forward in reducing premature cancer
deaths and related costs through an effective early detection, accepted by one of the world's largest
scientific IEEE conference








Furthermore, Crosetto
published several articles in scientific journals. 

He published his basic invention in a 45
page article in one of the most prestigious peer-review scientific journal:
Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Sec. A, vol. 436 (1999)
341-385. It is rare for such journal to publish a 45 page article by a single
author. This shows the merit of Crosetto’s work.
A
synthesis of his innovations for medical imaging applications, when combining
his basic invention with others he developed after the year 2000 can be found
in the 2003 IEEE-NSS-MIC article: “The
3-D Complete Body Screening (3D-CBS). Features and Implementation”
Conference record M7-129 
Recognition of the
invention
The
3D-CBS technology won the international Leonardo da Vinci Competition
after five hours of public scrutiny (worldwide via internet) from the
University of Pavia in Italy, comparing the 3D-CBS technology with projects
from leading world research laboratories, cancer centers and individuals. It
was also recognized valuable for early cancer detection by three international
public (also webcasted) scientific reviews in 2003, 2008 and 2010.
A frequent comment
from the public  
Comment:
“It is clear at this point that a greater survival rate can be obtained by
detecting more accurately, more signals from the tumor markers, but why is it
better than detecting another signal showing a change in odor, temperature,
fluorescence, conductivity, or tissue density using X-ray, CT scan, MRI,
Ultrasound, etc.?”
Response: 
“There are thousands of articles reporting that experimental results show that
cancer cells grow faster than normal cells and because they grows faster, they require
more nutrient, up to 70 times more than normal cells. Abnormal metabolism is an
important signal related to the start of the mutation from normal cells into cancerous
cells. Capturing more signals more accurately from tumor markers showing
abnormal consumption of nutrient from body cells could provide advantages in
early cancer detection. There are no similar advantages from other signals.” 
Follow
up comment: “I understand, and it makes sense! I want to have an exam like
this.  If a low cost screening of the entire body for all types of cancer in
patients without symptoms but, at high risk, can be done effectively (capturing
the majority of signals from any tumor markers combined with a radioisotope) with
the 3D-CBS technology, requiring a low level of radiation dose,
comparable to that of a mammogram then…

it would be a dramatic breakthrough in early cancer detection!

II – ADVANTAGES OF 3D-CBS COMPARED TO CURRENT PET




The
3D-CBS technology: The 3D-CBS technology relies on the same nuclear
reaction as current PET, however, it is unlike the 5,000 existing PET devices that
do not capture most of the radiation. This is because they scan only a portion
of the body and can only measure the dimensions of already-formed tumors. The
3D-CBS technology is designed for a cost-effective Complete Body Screening exam.
It measures minimum abnormal consumption of nutrient by body cells or by
detecting other anomalies, and is thus designed to achieve an effective
early cancer detection. (Read more...)

Crosetto’s effort to increase PET efficiency has been translated in a study
based on his innovative 3D-CBS technology (see http://links.unitedtoendcancer.info/doc2/431.pdf).
He presented a plan (see www.u2ec.org) to
build three prototypes to be tested on a sample population aged 50-75 in a
location with a constant death rate over the past 20 years. The advantages of
his innovative 3D-CBS technology, his plan to build three prototypes and test
them on a sample population, providing the benefits of reducing cancer deaths
and cost have been discussed in several public forums. No one has been able to
invalidate with scientific arguments Crosetto’s claim that his invention would
greatly reduce premature cancer deaths and cost. Therefore, funding should be
provided to implement 3D-CBS prototypes instead of funding less efficient
projects that did not go through this public scientific procedure. A difference
or no difference in the mortality rate will quantify the success or failure of
his proposed solution.

[8] The
innovations of the 3D-CBS technology will make it possible to achieve an
effective EARLY CANCER DETECTION, and also improve
the prognosis for the majority of tumors.



[9] A physician
could receive precious information from instrumentations and make a correct
diagnosis to avoid false positives and false negatives when the technique
behind each instrument is understood and developed to its full potential.
Positron Emission Technique works best when providing information of the
slightest abnormal metabolic activity (consumption of nutrient, growth, and for
showing other abnormal biological processes tagged by a radionuclide) that other
techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), X-ray, etc., cannot provide. This is what a physician should
expect, request and focus on a PET technique: an instrument that
precisely measures the slightest abnormal metabolism. It would be an
inappropriate use of PET to measure dimensions and CT to measure activities of
biological processes at the molecular level, as by analogy it would be
inappropriate to use a water meter to measure dimensions and a ruler to measure
monthly water consumption. The 3D-CBS develops this technique to its potential
in a cost-effective instrument that provides the maximum efficiency in
accurately detecting all possible signals from the tumor markers at the lowest
cost per valid signal captured. 



[10] It is improper for physicians, oncologists, hospital
administrators, etc., to ask PET manufacturers: “What is the spatial resolution
of your PET?” instead of asking: “What is the accuracy of your PET in detecting
the slightest abnormality in a specific biological process tagged with a
radionuclide?”  They do not ask what the spatial resolution is of a heart
monitor rate device or of an electric kWh meter, because they relate the
technique used by the instrument to perform the measurement with the
information they expect from the instrument. Therefore, it is inappropriate to
ask PET manufacturers to increase the spatial resolution of a device whose
technique features an inherent error that can be of several mm due to two
natural phenomena that cannot be eliminated.  Actually, the tumor can be at a
distance of several millimeters from where it appears to be from the image, and
could show a significant dimensional error. This is because each positron,
originating in the tumor, travels before encountering an electron and then
annihilates generating two photons that will be detected by the PET. The
distance travelled is called “positron range” and depends on the
radionuclide used (it is 13.8 mm for Rubidium; 82, 4.5 mm for Oxygen-15, etc.).
The second source of error is the “collinearity error”: the photons
generated do not diverge at exactly 180°; the difference in their angle when
projected on the crystal detectors generates an extra error of up to ~ 1.5 mm.
Physicians, oncologists and hospital administrators, instead of insisting with
PET manufacturers to increase spatial resolution, they should ask for an
improvement in the accuracy of measuring the slightest abnormal biological
process activity. This would provide important information that they were not
aware was possible (beyond their imagination) that would contribute to a more
accurate diagnosis. It is important for physicians, oncologists and hospital
administrators to better understand the physics on which the instrument rely.
By doing so they can ask for useful information that the instrument can provide
and not ask for an improvement in the measurement of parameters within the
limitations of the technique used by the instrument that will not be helpful in
making a more precise diagnosis aimed at saving a patient’s life.



[11] The 3D-CBS is
designed to be effective for early cancer detection because it is efficient,
safe and has a low examination cost. These features are achieved because the
3D-CBS is designed to accurately capture all possible signals from the tumor
markers at the lowest cost per valid signal captured. High efficiency allows:
(a) the detection of minimum abnormal metabolism which is a reason to suspect
cancer cells as they consume up to 70 times more nutrient than normal cells (b)
requires a safe, low radiation dose (0.5% mSv, 1/30 of the dose required by
current PET and 50% less than 1 mSv which is the maximum dose for screening
recommended by the International Commission for Radiation Protection –ICRP-)
and (c) a low examination cost because of the higher patient throughput given
the fact that the 3D-CBS can collect more valid data in a shorter time.



[12] Efficiency is
defined as the number of 511 keV pairs of photons detected by the device
divided by the number of 511 keV pairs of photons generated by the annihilation
of a positron with an electron.
  The
efficiency of the 3D-CBS is “Very High” because the Field Of View (FOV) of the
3D-CBS is much longer (140 cm vs. 16-18 cm of current PET),  therefore the
3D-CBS will capture significantly more pairs of photons because their number is
approximately proportional to the square of the increase in length of the
detector. In addition, the efficiency of the 3D-CBS is also increased (a) by
the 3D-Flow parallel-processing system capable of accurately capturing as many
signals as possible from the tumor markers, (b) by the simplified, detector
assembly and (c) by its capability to execute 3 x 3, or 4 x 4 real-time complex
algorithms for a duration longer than the time interval between two consecutive
input data.



[13] Current PET
are not suitable for early cancer detection because of their low efficiency,
high radiation requirement that makes it hazardous for screening, and a high
examination cost. Capturing insufficient signals from the tumor markers does
not allow for early detection. Current PET can see an anomaly in cell
metabolism only when the tumor is large or very active at an advance stage.
Tumors detected at an advanced stage have a much lower probability to be cured
and save patient’s life. Current PET devices require over 10 times the maximum
radiation dose recommended by ICRP, thus not permitted for screening. The
examination cost is high because patients’ throughput is low due to the fact
that a longer time is needed to acquire sufficient data for reliable statistics
that would avoid “false positives” and “false negatives”.



[14] The
efficiency of the existing PET devices (GE, Philips and Siemens) is “Very Low”
because the Field Of View (FOV) is only 16 to 18 cm. This statement is very simple
to be verified in any hospital or clinic that utilizes a PET. You may ask the
PET operator how many valid pairs of 511 keV signals from tumor markers its PET
is able to record per second during a specific examination. The total number of
pairs of 511keV tumor marker signals generated per second depends on the dose
of radionuclide administered to the patient; 10 mCi of radionuclide (the
average amount of radionuclide per examination used for current PET) generates
370 million pairs per second. The EFFICIENCY for any specific PET device can be
calculated by dividing the number of valid 511 keV pairs of signals captured by
the total number of pairs generated by the radionuclide.



[15] The meaning
of TRUE TOTAL-BODY is a device that can perform a single examination for most
organs, capturing tumor markers from the entire body at one time in a
stationary position.



[16] G. Borasi, F. Fioroni, A. Del Guerra and G. Lucignani. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular
Imaging (2010) 37:1629–1632. Article from leaders in the field stating that
Crosetto’s 3D-CBS technology is the first, true “total-body” PET system.



[17] Current PET
although they might be called Whole-Body PET are not TRUE TOTAL BODY because
their detector length is only approximately 16 cm to 18 cm. They are unable to
detect most of the oblique signals generated from the tumor markers. This
limitation does not allow all three advantages that make early cancer detection
effective: (a) high efficiency, (b) a low, safe radiation dose and (c) a low
examination cost.



[18] The
examination duration must allow for the capture of enough data to form reliable
statistics for different parts of the body showing the slightest abnormal
metabolism. The 3D-CBS can capture hundreds of times more data per second
compared to current PET. This is because the 3D-CBS captures signals from tumor
markers all at once from the entire body lying in a stationary position with a
detector that is 140 cm long. The current PET is missing signals from the tumor
markers arriving at an angle because the detector is only 16 cm in length. This
requires positioning the detector on eleven different parts of the body. The
specifications of GE Discovery PET/CT 710 states that the duration of the
examination should be the “physician’s preference”. His preference should allow
enough data to be acquired and therefore avoid “false positives” and “false
negatives.” In order to obtain comparable statistical data, the duration of the
examination on current PET should be hundreds of times longer than the 3D-CBS
examination, which captures hundreds of times more signals per second. This
would be impractical, not only for the difficulty and discomfort to remain
still for several hours, but also because the radionuclide would cease
activity. It is reasonable to expect the examination time for the current PET
to last at least ten times longer than the 3D-CBS (40 minutes vs. 4 minutes) in
order to provide reliable information to reject at least “false positives” and
“false negatives”. However, unlike the 3D-CBS, the acquired data by the current
PET would still not provide enough information to make early cancer detection
possible. The values in this table do not match those indicated by the
manufacturers, however, it would be appropriate for each physician to adopt the
suggested 40 minute examination time for GE Discovery PET/CT 710 and Siemens
Biograph TruePoint having a detector length of ~ 16 cm, and 35 minutes for
Philips Gemini LXL that has a detector length of 18 cm

What small town life usually does not offer is a venue that helps people of any age place themselves more directly within that natural and small community environment, as well as within a larger, universal community.  OM Yoga is a projected yoga studio that targets people of any age, gender, or body type to learn how to meditate, gain flexibility, lose weight, and feel better about themselves.  OM will offer yoga and meditation classes for all levels: yoga for beginning, intermediate, and advanced practices, yoga for kids, prenatal/postnatal yoga, yoga for the ""round"" body, senior citizen yoga, family yoga, and mommy/daddy and me classes in the heart of downtown McMinnville.  All surrounding towns are welcome and are encouraged to attend. Our target opening date is Friday, August 16, 2013. </p>
<p>Through the grapevine, and then finally with deeper research, it is clear that there is a high demand for a studio in this area that targets all ages and sizes.  Yoga is not just for those who are already fit and flexible.  Anyone can learn to be more flexible, more graceful, and more aware of their physical capabilities with guidance.  OM aims to do this at affordable rates for the general public.  Many studios of these kinds charge high amounts; we aim to eliminate such financial barriers so a larger population may be exposed to the benefits of yoga.  We also offer ""community"" prices, 3 times a week, to even further accommodate those who are interested but have limited means.  Furthermore, we plan to hold classes every day in the morning, afternoon, and evening to accommodate anyone's schedule.  The rest relies on our sweat and dedication.</p>
<p>We have found a location where the owner is offering reasonable rent and is willing to predominately renovate the 3550 square-foot building to our needs.  We need to find the means for an initial deposit and rent (first and last month's), other start-up business expenses; we also need to purchase mats, blankets, blocks, and other amenities to personalize the studio to make it a bright, comfortable, and pleasant place to practice. We also need to contribute a certain amount to advertising within the 8 cities/towns (McMinnville, Sparta, Spencer, Smithville, Centertown, Woodbury, Morrison, and Manchester--all are within a 15 to 30 minute drive from the studio) to fully target those who could use our facility.  OM's minimum start-up goal $6000.  If we build it, they <em>will </em>come!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello World!  My name is Nicole Lundy and I am on a <strong>MISSION!!</strong></p>
<p>                             <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.nelanibeauty.com/images/headshots/bio%20pic%203.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nicole Lundy""/></p>
<p>When I started working on my skincare line in 2009, I knew that it had to positively impact and directly help others in need.  Fast forward - 4 years later- and as we prep for launch, we are supporting one of the most amazing organizations by the name of charity: water to provide clean water to developing countries around the world.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has reported that dieseases from unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the mission and transparency of charity: water! Every funded project is documented and certified with a completion report.  (see more details about charity: water below).</p>
<p><strong>So, this campaign serves a dual purpose.</strong> 1) To provide CLEAN water to a community in a developing country AND 2) launch an amazing collection of healthy skincare products that are GREAT for your skin, the environment and your life.</p>

<h3>'Oh, My Goodness' CLEANSER:  </h3>
<p>Our cleanser is formulated with potent anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-irritant ingredients that cleanse your skin without excessive drying or irritation.  </p>
<p>The combination of key proteins, vitamins and minerals in this complex penetrate the skins basal layer to replenish devitalized cells.</p>
<p><strong>Cool [Healthy + Good For You] in this formula include:</strong></p>
<p><em>Aloe Vera Leaf Juice</em> - Aloe vera is very high in polysaccharides which act as a shield over the skin that keeps moisture in and pollutants out.  This makes aloe one of the most effective topical defense ingredient against the damaging effects of our environment.</p>
<p><em>Centipeda Cunninghamii Extract</em> - An herb from the daisy family and potent with anti-inflammatory and anti-bacteraial properties as well as soothing anti-irritant benefits.  A series of clinical tests conducted at the Wellington School of Medicine demonstrated that this extract produced 50% more stimulatory growth in skin cell fibroblasts, which is the foundation of cell renewal.</p>
<p><em>Oat Protein</em> - Oat protein has the ability to absorb excess oil, and help your skin retain moisture.  This natural starch also aids the skin as an anti-inflammatory ingredient.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>'Now That's Amazing' TONER:</h3>
<p>Our amazing toner is designed to improve the moisture levels in your skin as well as smooth and renew your skin.  The powerful extracts help combat the effects of stress, sunlight and other forms of environmental damage.</p>
<p>92.85% of the ingredients in our formula are from organic farming.</p>
<p><strong>Cool [Healthy + Good For You] in this formula include:</strong></p>
<p><em>Pancratium Maritimum Extract</em> -<strong> </strong>The source of this extract is a rare white lily native to the islands off the Brittany Coast of France.  This ingredient influences the dendrites that are responsible for the movement of melanin into skin cells, thereby inhibiting hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure and stress.</p>
<p><em>Sodium Hyaluronate</em> - Derived from fermentation of a vegetable source, this product mimics the exact structure of Hyaluronic Acid, a necessary constituent found in body tissues and fluids.  Its regenerative functions are effective in treating prematurely aged skin, induced by exposure to extreme climates and stress.</p>
<p><em>Rose Flower Water</em> - Its origin is the famous Valley of the Roses in Bulgaria, where the roses are hand-harvested at the perfect time of year.  The water has been used as a soothing aid for centuries to protect and preserve many of the most famous faces in history.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>'What A Delight' MOISTURIZER:</h3>
<p>Now you can protect your skin with this rich and nourishing face creme loaded with antioxidants of Vitamin A, C, and E, combined with plant oils for maximized penetration, moisture retention and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Cool [Healthy + Good For You] in this formula include:</strong></p>
<p><em>Borage Oil </em>- This oil is said to be one of the best sources of gamma linoleic acid (GLA).  GLA is noted for its effects on the skin and its ability to reduce dryness and keep skin healthy, supple, and young-looking by regulating the hydration of the skin.</p>
<p><em>Oat Beta Glucan</em> - A fiber-type complex sugar derived from the cell wall of oats is very effective at activating white blood cells and provides the immune system's first line of defense against foreign invaders.  Oat beta glucan helps to remove cellular debris resulting from oxidative damage and speed up the recovery of damaged tissue.</p>
<p><em>Shea Butter</em> - Shea butter is a remarkable, all-purpose moisturizer and skin protector, particularly useful for smoothing fine lines and wrinkles.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and well-moisturized yet not greasy.  The producers of our shea butter are women farmers belonging to farming groups and cooperatives of northern Uganda and southern Sudan.  Our support of these producers increases the value of the living shea tree engendering conservation of indigenous African woodland for future generations.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>'My Saving Grace' SERUM:</h3>
<p>Now you can balance your skin everyday with this powerful antioxidant hydrator.  Our luxurious serum brings a maximum amount of moisture to the surface while delivering cell-renewing nutrients deeply into the subcutaneous layers of the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Cool [Healthy + Good For You] in this formula include:</strong></p>
<p><em>Phospholipids</em> - Phospholipids are substances, which contain fatty acids, glycerol, a nitrogenous base and phosphoric acid.  A balance of sterols and phospholipids is important to healthy skin.  As skin cells die as a part of the natural process of keratinization, this balance is upset, and if the phospholipid-cholesterol balance is not restored, new cells will not regenerate or will regenerate more slowly.</p>
<p><em>Tocopherol Acetate</em> - A form of Vitamin E, it performs as an internal moisturizer and acts as a free-radical scavenger to help combat lipid peroxidation.  Vitamin E is also well known for its antioxidant properties.</p>
<p><em>Rosemary Leaf Extract</em> - This extract is naturally produced by super-critical carbon dioxide extraction and contributes antioxidant protection for the skin.</p>

<h3> The Impact</h3>
<p>It is a great time to support small businesses! Ne`lani Skincare is doing its own little part to stimulate the economy.  Even a small business like ours can make an impact.  We are currently working with web designers, graphic artists, marketing/branding professionals, professional service vendors and manufacturers.  Our products will then have to be transported by carriers, which continues the cycle and keeps money moving.</p>
<p><strong>[COOL IMPACT ALERT]:</strong> We will be donating 15% from each pledge of $25 or more to charity: water (<a href=""http://www.charitywater.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.charitywater.org</a>).  90% of the $30,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and unhygienic living conditions are children under 5 years old - reported by the World Health Organization.  Our goal is to support an entire water project in a community of a developing country.  Just so you know, a typical water project can serve 150-300 people in a community.  We will be recognized by charity: water as a supporter and we will recieve a completion report when the project that we supported is completed.  The completion report will be posted on nelaniskincare.com</p>
                    <a href=""http://www.charitywater.org/whywater"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.charitywater.org/media/banners/300x250_baby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>
</div>
<div>You may be wondering why we at Ne`lani Skincare chose to support charity: water.  Here's why.  Water is <em>vital </em>for life. It's also very important in helping our bodies flush out deadly toxins and keep itself regulated.  It's very easy to take having clean water for granted.  As a Beauty Expert and a Gorgeous Lifestyle Advocate, I preach all of the time that water is a key ingredient for maintaining your beauty.  From the bottom of my heart, I want every single person in the world have access to CLEAN water.  Everybody deserves it!

<p>Last but not least, we are making really fun and cool products that are GREAT for your skin, environment and your life.</p>

 The Impact
It is a great time to support small businesses! Ne`lani Skincare is doing its own little part to stimulate the economy.  Even a small business like ours can make an impact.  We are currently working with web designers, graphic artists, marketing/branding professionals, professional service vendors and manufacturers.  Our products will then have to be transported by carriers, which continues the cycle and keeps money moving.
[COOL IMPACT ALERT]: We will be donating 15% from each pledge of $25 or more to charity: water (www.charitywater.org).  90% of the $30,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and unhygienic living conditions are children under 5 years old - reported by the World Health Organization.  Our goal is to support an entire water project in a community of a developing country.  Just so you know, a typical water project can serve 150-300 people in a community.  We will be recognized by charity: water as a supporter and we will recieve a completion report when the project that we supported is completed.  The completion report will be posted on nelaniskincare.com
                    

You may be wondering why we at Ne`lani Skincare chose to support charity: water.  Here's why.  Water is vital for life. It's also very important in helping our bodies flush out deadly toxins and keep itself regulated.  It's very easy to take having clean water for granted.  As a Beauty Expert and a Gorgeous Lifestyle Advocate, I preach all of the time that water is a key ingredient for maintaining your beauty.  From the bottom of my heart, I want every single person in the world have access to CLEAN water.  Everybody deserves it!
Make sure check out the [VIDEO] link - WATER CHANGES EVERYTHING 
Last but not least, we are making really fun and cool products that are GREAT for your skin, environment and your life.

<h3> What is Fittr?</h3>
<p>Fittr is an exercise service meant to help everyone reach their fitness goals more effectively and intelligently.  After 8 months of development time we plan to officially launch Fittr's service on our website and an iPhone app on January 1st.  With your help we feel confident we can hit the ground running and help people of all types get in shape.</p>
<h3>How Fittr came to be</h3>
<p>Fittr is the result of a need we found in the fitness industry to help people, at any fitness level, to reach their fitness goals.  We believe people should have more options than only hiring a personal trainer to get personalized workouts, and we believe it should be much less expensive than the hourly rates we have come across.  We have found that many personal trainers cost between $25 and $75 dollars an hour, and this could get you in a group with strangers doing the same workout with people who may have different fitness goals.</p>
<p>So we created a pretty cool workout generator powered by artificial intelligence to help anyone reach their fitness goals more effectively and intelligently.  There are other websites and apps that offer a big list of exercises and some services offer a few pre-made workouts that may or may not apply to everyone.  What Fittr does that’s different from anyone else is that we ask you what your fitness goal is, how many days a week you are willing to work out and what equipment you have available.  All of this creates a very specialized workout program that improves with feedback from each user as they let us know what is working and what is not.</p>

<h3>How the Fittr engine works</h3>
<p><span>The Fittr engine provides it's groundbreaking workouts from a real time neuro cortical simulation that runs on a GPU supercomputing cluster.  The simulation's organization is based roughly on the major human cortical regions and includes the thalamus, basal ganglia, Perirhinal Cortex, Entorhinal Cortex, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Hippocampus, motor cortex, and our own speculation of the pre-frontal cortex which supports long term decision making.</span></p>
<p><span><span>By working just like a brain, Fittr's engine is able to work like no other system available. Through looking at data given by millions of interactions, it is able to make distinctions that are not able to be seen by even human eyes. By bringing together users weight inputs, Fittr correlates results with averages in other similar users and generates a workout plan that will get individuals better results.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The user experience</h3>
<p>In order to understand what is and isn’t working we felt it was necessary to highlight progress for our users.  As you work out you can enter the weight you lift for each exercise on your iPhone and it will automatically track everything you do.  The idea is to enable all our users to better understand the improvements they have made which we hope will encourage everyone to keep working hard.</p>
<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.fittr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Take me to Fittr's homepage ""><img alt=""Your individual workout headquarters "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://e2362a3c81162a5acf9a-a99bd74d3c954a9a134b095682e4d1cb.r7.cf1.rackcdn.com/dashboardss.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""User Dashboard""/></a></p>
<p>As a result of users’ improvements we have established a wide range of trophies that are rewarded for certain accomplishments and achievements.  Since everyone is at a different level of fitness and everyone has very different fitness goals we tried to offer trophies that apply to anyone.  So if you have a goal of losing 75 pounds and it seems like an insurmountable goal, Fittr offers trophies for losing 10 pounds, 20 pounds, and so on.  Our intention is to keep people on track with tangible goals in a series of benchmarks, and encourage people to reach their ultimate goal in a safe and healthy way.  And if trophies don’t get you motivated we have added a fun accountability feature that will share with all your Facebook friends that you missed a workout which we believe will get people going.</p>

<p>What makes Fittr truly unique is our variable process.  There are many exercises that can be applied to different fitness goals.  Take bench press which is a widely used exercise in most people’s programs.  If you were to do 3 sets of 10 reps you will get different results than if you completed 6 sets at 1 rep each.  To take it another step further if you were complete each rep moving the bar 3 seconds up and 3 seconds down you would have an entirely different workout.  Fittr offers millions of combinations like these which help anyone more specifically reach their fitness goals more intelligently. </p>

<div>
<h3>Our plan and what we're asking for</h3>
<p>We have been working on Fittr for 8 months and we are nearing completion of our first operational version with many additional updates on the horizon.  Our website is currently up and with ability to create an account, so <a href=""http://www.fittr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Take me to Fittr's homepage"">check it out</a> and create a completely free account to learn more while we are finishing everything.  </p>
<p>We are asking for your help so that we can prepare for server costs, begin a basic marketing campaign, and essentially keep the lights on until we finish the project.  We foresee our biggest hurdle, initially, will be getting awareness so we have made plans to create a Facebook and Google ad campaign as well as contracting a search engine optimization company to help us reach larger audiences.  </p>
<p><strong>How we plan to grow (Stretch Goals)</strong></p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal we have a long list of ideas we plan to make a reality.  Here are a few we hope to accomplish soon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an Android app (iPhone app scheduled for Jan 1st launch)</li>
<li>Hire a nutritionist as a consultant to provide our users with <span>excellent</span> nutritional support for their fitness goals</li>
<li>Create <span>opportunities</span> for high school coaches and athletes to enable teams to <span>receive</span> instruction from strength coaches and allow coaches to monitor athletes' progress.  (more info to come soon)</li>

Some of you know me from work, some of you know me from tumblr or twitter, some of you know me from steampunk conventions or concerts. Maybe you've heard me interview your favorite musician, author or fashion designer. Maybe you've read one of my books. Maybe you don't know me yet.</p>
<p><br/>I'm about to turn 27 in a couple weeks and have struggled for the last 4 years with various health issues following a stressful period and an accident at work that landed me in the hospital briefly. A large part of the struggle has been faulty sinuses... my doctor has recently taken an MRI of my head and discovered that my sinuses don't drain properly because the tubes are extremely small. Much smaller than they should be! This has made an impact on my health in many ways including:</p>
<p>*headaches that sometimes become migraines</p>
<p>*vision problems</p>
<p>*hearing problems</p>
<p>*tinnitus</p>
<p>*dizziness</p>
<p>*trouble concentrating/sleeping</p>
<p>*pressure in my head</p>
<p>*chronically stuffy nose</p>
<p>*weakened immune system</p>
<p>*low energy</p>
<p>*panic/anxiety issues</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I need to have endoscopic sinus surgery done so that my sinuses will drain. I've gotten progressively sicker over the last 3 years and over this last winter, I had two sinus infections and was sick for about 4-5 months straight. The doctor has already had me on several rounds of heavy antibiotics. Summer usually is better for me, and the doctor has determined that I NEED the surgery done by the end of summer or I could end up back on antibiotics or even in the hospital in winter.</p>
<p>At this point, I have applied for all of the financial help I can, but because I don't have insurance and because this surgery is considered 'elective', I can't get financial help. This is the most discounted price the hospital could offer me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before all of these health issues, I was a hard working go-getter with a huge personality and a lot of energy to spare. People even said they wished they had half the ambition and energy I had! I've lost my energy and a lot of my confidence. While this surgery won't fix some of the other health issues I struggle with, it will certainly help a large handful of them and help me to get back to writing books, building up my friends, sharing energy with others, interviewing people you love, making jewelry and trying to create a more glittery world.</p>

<p>The website only allows me to list a certain amount of pledge prizes but I would also like to mention that if you donate $150, I will write a short story for you, based on a word or phrase you choose.

<p><span>Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a very rare genetic condition in which the skin and internal body linings blister at the slightest knock or rub, causing painful, open wounds.

<p><span>The only treatment for EB is daily wound care and bandaging. The daily routine is a grueling, multi-faceted daily regimen lasting up to 4 hours in more severe patients.

<h3>Genetic testing and dependable transportation:</h3>
</div>

<p>There will be many miles traveled from Eli's Carrollton home to Atlanta and Lithia Springs where Eli's doctors are. Gas costs are high, car maintenance is expensive and there may even be times Randall will not get to work because of things required for Eli's care. He has already missed more than a month since Eli's birth.</p>
<p>Every cent raised for Eli and his family will be needed for all this and so much more that I'm sure we aren't aware of yet.</p>
<p>Genetic testing will need to be done on Eli to find out what sub-type EB Simplex Eli has. Finding out his sub-type is important to know because it will help doctors and his family know more about how to treat his EB. This is a huge expense that is not covered by any insurance.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have worked with Corey at my job now for almost two years. During that time I have learned a lot about him and his determined and hard-working attitude. But merely working with someone just scratches the surface on the window into their life. We all deal with pain and suffering in our lives, each coated in different circumstances. Whatever you can do to help is already immensly appreciated. Though Corey might not realize it, he is loved. There is a community watching out for him, willing and able to help. </p>

<h2><strong>THE ISSUE - </strong></h2>
<p>It's difficult to convey the  human challenges that people on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota are facing.  The <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality_rate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">infant mortality rate </a></strong>(IMR) is the number of deaths of babies under one year old per 1,000 live births.  The IMR on Pine Ridge is <strong>300% higher than the </strong><strong>national average - the highest in the US.</strong>  Moms face racism, poverty and psychological challenges.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>WHY I STOPPED FILMING TO RAISE THIS MONEY:</strong>  After years of research regarding the history and reasons American Indians have the worst health disparities in the US, Kitty Farmer is producing a documentary film, <strong><em><a href=""http://vimeo.com/24242490"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What's in the Heart - Can't be Taken</a></em>.</strong> (trailer) </p>
<p><em><strong>""The statistics on Indian health are heartbreaking - American people have no idea the unimaginable and preventable suffering our American Indian neighbors are enduring.  It's as if we're talking about a third world country."" </strong> </em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>           New York Times/Wall Street Journal Statistics - </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>            Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota <br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>- 97% of of the population on Pine Ridge live below federal poverty line.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>- Unemployment rate vacillates from 85% - 95%.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>- Death due to heart disease: twice the national average.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>- Elderly die each winter from hypothermia.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>- Median income on Pine Ridge is approximately $2,600 to $3,500 per year.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>- 60% of homes are substandard, no water, electricity, adequate insulation,  and sewage systems.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>- Teen suicide is 4 times the national average.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>- Average life expectancy is between 45 years and 48 years for men and 52 years for women, the shortest in the Western hemisphere outside Haiti.<br/></strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Indians are not welfare receipients. </strong> The land and resources that have made the USA the most powerful country in the world were not lost in warfare, but rather exchanged for basic social services - healthcare, housing and education.  The exchange that took place is documented in 494 legally-binding treaties (contracts) and is included in the US constitution.</p>
<p><br/><strong>It's fair to say that after 200 + years, the government may never fulfill its' legal trust responsibility to American Indians. </strong> In the meantime,<strong> our Indian neighbors need our help. </strong> Programs like Healthy Start are critical to supplement the abysmal failure of the government to honor this responsibility. <strong> Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, calls the government's treatment of American Indians, ""<em>a historic failure.</em>""</strong></p>

<h2><strong>FASTEST WAY TO HELP IN THE MEANTIME -</strong></h2>
<p>One of the wisest investments regarding this crisis is in <strong>Maternal/Child Health. To allow Lakota babies a ""healthy start"" from pre to post-natal means a lesser chance of developing all the preventable diseases that cause lives to be lived very sick, short and full of suffering.   </strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>HOPE and the SOLUTION -</strong> </h2>
<p title=""Healthy Start program"">With Pine Ridge serving as a case study for the film, Kitty became familiar with the remarkable <strong><a href=""http://www.nationalhealthystart.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Healthy Start program"">Healthy Start Program</a></strong> (HS). The Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) HS program with barely enough money for pens and copy paper is turning the despair and statistics around - through education, nutrition, traditional Lakota values and emotional support for the at-risk moms and babies.</p>
<p title=""Healthy Start program"">Last year, Roberta Ecoffey, coordinator of the OST HS program was told they had to vacate their offices due to asbestos.  A mold-infested trailer was given as a replacement.  Obviously unaccepetable, they quickly moved into a storage room behind a video store.  <strong>Recently, an engineer from the Indian Health Service inspected the room and declared that it was a health hazard due to high levels of rat feces,  which can cause the Hanta Virus.  Because of this, the heat cannot be turned on!</strong></p>
<p>Roberta and one other co-worker serve over 380 mothers.  Shocked by what the HS program was going through, Kitty stopped production of the film, and became determined to raise the money for a new HS home. </p>
<h2>
<strong>The new Healthy Start Center building will provide not only a space, but hope for a brighter future.</strong>  </h2>
<p>Just down the highway from where the new HS Center will be located is the site of the <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Wounded Knee Massacre"">Wounded Knee Massacre</a> </strong>where 123 years ago,  290 unarmed Lakota women, children, babies and elders were massacred by the US 7th Cavalry.  Despite this unimaginable loss and trauma, <strong>the Lakota have a resilient spirit that is undeniable -</strong> <strong>they need our help in providing a 'healthy start' for the future Lakota Nation.</strong></p>
<p>Many tribes are wealthy because of casinos, but Pine Ridge is not one of them.  Programming for HS comes from the federal government. The idea of a new building seemed hopeless.  So, the quest began – where would HS find a warm, safe office?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>AMAZING TEAM FOR THE SOLUTION -</strong> </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>While on Pine Ridge, Kitty also met with <strong><a href=""http://www.lakotasolarenterprises.com/Henry%20Red%20Cloud%20History/HRCH.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Henry Red Cloud, Oglala Lakota"">Henry Red Cloud, Oglala Lakota,</a></strong> winner of the 2012 <strong><a href=""http://www.energyglobe.info/en/world-awards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Energy Globe Awards</a>, </strong>the world's most prestigious environmental award. Henry, a ""modern-day <strong><em>Lakota solar warrior</em></strong>"" builds sustainable houses and unique solar heating systems.   While speaking with Henry about the state of the HS office,  the idea was born that he could help by creating a sustainable, culturally-relevant building that is easily replicable on other reservations.</p>
<p>After reading about the needs of the program, <strong>Ritch Voss, AIA, LEED-A, Senior Associate/Architect</strong> of the <strong><a href=""http://www.dahlingroup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dahlin Group</a> </strong>asked for his firm to be chosen to draw the plans for the new HS center.  This was a dream come true - one of the nation's leading architectural firms combining their expertise with Henry's ingenuity and vision to provide the Lakota with a better future!  The OST tribal council has granted 5 acres located in the center of Pine Ridge village for the new HS Center - a very convenient location for moms who often have no car. </p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2>
<strong>Your donation will not only prevent unnecessary deaths of Lakota babies, but provide jobs and training for Lakota men and women.</strong>  </h2>
<p>The team will make certain to <strong>provide training and jobs first and foremost to Lakota men and women during construction. </strong></p>
<p> This team has agreed to pursue the funding, design and construction of the new HS Center, which has the support of the OST Tribal Council. The team is uniquely qualified to see this project through. The National Indian Youth Leadership Project, a 501 (c) (3) will fiscally sponsor the project, so <strong>all donations are a tax deduction.</strong></p>
<p>We're beginning <strong>PHASE 1</strong> of a 2-phase project to see this building completed.</p>
<p>In PHASE 1, we'll finalize the design, sustainability features, permits, engineering and ultimately have architectural drawings to further raise money to complete the project. (PHASE 2.) In the event the goal is exceeded, all donations will be placed into a separate account for Phase 2 (construction.)</p>
<h2><strong>How your donation will move this project forward.<br/></strong></h2>
<p>-Full architectural drawings and Engineering</p>
<p>-Coordination of all permits</p>
<p>-Marketing for Phase 2 fundraising, Travel</p>
<p>-Basic expenses for the myriad tasks associated with pulling this project together</p>

FASTEST WAY TO HELP IN THE MEANTIME -
One of the wisest investments regarding this crisis is in Maternal/Child Health. To allow Lakota babies a ""healthy start"" from pre to post-natal means a lesser chance of developing all the preventable diseases that cause lives to be lived very sick, short and full of suffering.   

HOPE and the SOLUTION - 
With Pine Ridge serving as a case study for the film, Kitty became familiar with the remarkable Healthy Start Program (HS). The Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) HS program with barely enough money for pens and copy paper is turning the despair and statistics around - through education, nutrition, traditional Lakota values and emotional support for the at-risk moms and babies.
Last year, Roberta Ecoffey, coordinator of the OST HS program was told they had to vacate their offices due to asbestos.  A mold-infested trailer was given as a replacement.  Obviously unaccepetable, they quickly moved into a storage room behind a video store.  Recently, an engineer from the Indian Health Service inspected the room and declared that it was a health hazard due to high levels of rat feces,  which can cause the Hanta Virus.  Because of this, the heat cannot be turned on!
Roberta and one other co-worker serve over 380 mothers.  Shocked by what the HS program was going through, Kitty stopped production of the film, and became determined to raise the money for a new HS home. 

The new Healthy Start Center building will provide not only a space, but hope for a brighter future.  
Just down the highway from where the new HS Center will be located is the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre where 123 years ago,  290 unarmed Lakota women, children, babies and elders were massacred by the US 7th Cavalry.  Despite this unimaginable loss and trauma, the Lakota have a resilient spirit that is undeniable - they need our help in providing a 'healthy start' for the future Lakota Nation.
Many tribes are wealthy because of casinos, but Pine Ridge is not one of them.  Programming for HS comes from the federal government. The idea of a new building seemed hopeless.  So, the quest began – where would HS find a warm, safe office?
 

AMAZING TEAM FOR THE SOLUTION - 
 
While on Pine Ridge, Kitty also met with Henry Red Cloud, Oglala Lakota, winner of the 2012 World Energy Globe Awards, the world's most prestigious environmental award. Henry, a ""modern-day Lakota solar warrior"" builds sustainable houses and unique solar heating systems.   While speaking with Henry about the state of the HS office,  the idea was born that he could help by creating a sustainable, culturally-relevant building that is easily replicable on other reservations.

<div>My name is Lindsay Jack, which is in fact my first name, and I'm starting this campaign because I need new arch supports. Health problems with my feet began shortly after I was born when my parents noticed that I had inward turned feet, or pigeon toed feet. Some children's feet self correct but mine were not self correcting. As a result, I was required to wear steel reinforced braces on my feet every night to bed for two years between the ages of two and four. One result of having pigeon toed feet is that I also have flat feet. It might not seem that having flat feet is really all that impactful but it's a condition which affects my health every day. Having flat feet means that I experience chronic foot pain in the form of bunions (big toe pain), plantar fascitis (arch pain) and achilis tendinitis (back of the foot pain). Having flat feet also means that my entire skeletal structure is out of alignment and has resulted in both knee and lower back injuries. My custom made arch supports greatly reduce my daily pain and help me to walk comfortably but after four years I have worn them through. I'm asking for help, something I don't do easily, because I work a low paying job as a waitress and I am already thousands of dollars in debt due to related medical treatments such as physiotherapy. As my family are from a working poor background they are unable to contribute to my campaign in any major way. Your help will mean that I can get a new pair of arch supports which will have a noticeable, long lasting impact on my quality of health and my peace of mind. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The links below will take you to my performaces pages as slam poet LtwothaJ and as one of the community organizers of the KW Poetry Slam.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Where's this all going?</h3>
<div>For helping me I want to help you in return so I'm offering some bonuses most of them are skill sharing based and aimed at people who live in or near Kitchener-Waterloo. I am an acclaimed and winning slam poet and am willing to offer slam lessons. I'm also a trained bartender and eager teacher. I'm a certifide reiki practitioner and more than happy to offer distance healing to campaign contributors.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Custom made arch supports cost 400$ plus tax and come out to loosely 450$. I'm asking 500$ also to off set the costs of using the services of this website, about 50$. If I reach my goal I break even and can get my arch supports at no cost to me. If I don't make the full 500$ I'm still planning on getting my arch supports though this will likely cost me in the form of continued medical debt. I'm very eager not to indebt myself further.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
The reality is that I am a person with chronic pain and that I was born on the wrong side of a system that favors those with priviledge. Most likely I will experience some form of pain on a regular basis for the rest of my life. This doesn't mean that getting arch supports is futile though. On the contrary, any improvement to my daily quality of life is a BIG improvement for me. Right now, I'm on my way back to school and hoping to become a naturopath. I want to spend my life helping people who experience chronic pain conditions like mine and educating individuals on self care as well as communities on how to create better circles of care for those in need. By helping me today you are part of that work tomorrow. You're making the future now and helping me be better able to help others.</div>
<div>
<h3>No Money, No Problem</h3>
I get not having money and it's hard when you really want to give money but you don't have it. There are a lot of ways you can contribute to my health and well being without money. If you are a distance healer please send me healing energy (indicate the date and time before doing so). Give me a gentle hug. Offer me your seat on the bus since riding the bus standing is painful for me. If we're comfortable enough I like foot rubs and they help. Most importantly, you can help me by asking me about my health and talking to me about my life so I don't feel so alone in what I'm going through :)</div></div>","Support Arch Supports!

<h3>Eight years ago, Carl Miron opened the gates on Colorados first real Offroad park, this was to provide a place for various types of offroading enthusiasts to come and play, from 4x4s to motocross, and everything in between. However that wasnt the only reason, Carls son, Collin has cystic fibrosis, a deadly lung disease with a high mortality rate. It was one of Collins major desires to be able to race cars, specifically desert racing. With the help of the Make-A-Wish foundation, Collin was able to build a great running racecar, and race competitively for the last few years, but that is going to come to an end, unless the park gets some outside help.  Over the last few years, insurance, fuel, and the overall weak economy has put the park in the hole financially, this year resulting in not being able to come up with the money to cover expenses. Carl, and family, along with a couple of other people, have covered everything out of pocket for a long time to keep the gates open, and provide this great playground for all of us in the offroading community, but the savings are gone, and the pockets have run dry. All of us that enjoy CORE will be without anywhere to play next year, unless we help out now. Please help give back, to someone who has given it all to provide us with this great facility!!!</h3>

</div><p><b>A Smashing Good
Time to Benefit Vagabond Kitchen.</b></p>
<p>Wheeling, West Virginia, United States  Food</p>
<p><b>It's All About
the Experience</b></p>
<p>There are dozens of factors contributing to a
phenomenal dining experience. When we serve folks at Vagabond Kitchen, we
concern ourselves with everything from the way diners are first greeted to
their experience paying their bill. One thing we think would enhance the
experience we offer, is a new set of plates and dishes.</p>
<p>Vagabond Kitchen opened on June 8, 2014, in Downtown
Wheeling’s historic McLure Hotel, after the Kitchen's Head Chef and Co-Owner,
Matt Welsch, completed a year of interstate travel developing his culinary
travel blog, Vagabond Chef.</p>
<p>Welsch visited over sixty different restaurants and
culinary communities interviewing and working in the most diverse and superb
eateries the country has to offer, and when he returned to his hometown of
Wheeling, WV, he was primed to offer the area’s most unique and premier dining
experience.</p>
<p>Welsch and his wife, Katie, opened Vagabond Kitchen
with dreams of pursuing handcrafted food rooted in local community while
participating in the revival of the downtown area nestled on the banks of the
Ohio River. They brought years of experience and passion to the table but
lacked the capital that most restaurant startups are afforded..</p>
<p>Bootstrapping the operation has been challenging, but
the Welsches firmly believe they made the right choice. The response from the
community has been astounding, even thoughit's still a daily uphill battle. A
pile of maxed-out credit cards, along with the continual challenge of operating
a high-end restaurant hidden away in the basement of a hotel in the recovering
downtown area of Wheeling have left some goals unrealized.</p>
<p>One of the biggest of these unrealized goals is the
improvement of the Kitchen's dinnerware. And for that, we're asking for your
help.</p>
<p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Because the Vagabond Way is always a bit unorthodox,
and in trying to give everyone a fun, we're funding our new plates by breaking
old ones. At the end of January, we're going to have a party where we'll break
old and donated plates. We're asking you to donate money for the opportunity to
break the old ones, and the proceeds from that event will be  used 
to the new dinnerware that really fits the quality of experience our
patrons have come to expect.</p>
<p>We've done a lot of research into what plates would be
best. We've considerd price, shape, color, durability, and style. We've learned
that we need at least a grand to get just the basics of what we need. If we can
raise more, we'll have the opportunity to further improve our presentation with
more glassware, different plates for different menu items, etc.</p>
<p>If the campaign goes really well, we'd like to put some
money into redoing the bar area and wait station of the restaurant. This would
include a new bar with seating, shelves for display and merchandise, and a
metal Vagabond Kitchen sign hanging over the space. We would need several
thousand to accomplish this, but hey, we're dreamers, and we’ve seen first hand
how Wheeling can make dreams come true.</p>
<p>The core perks for our campaign are the plates you get
to break. However, at higher donation levels, we have spiced things up a bit by
including t-shirts and catered dinners. We want to offer you value for your
much appreciated help. Let us know how we can. Without you, there would be no
us!</p>
<p><b>The Importance
of Presentation</b></p>
<p>It may seem a simple thing to help a local restaurant
buy some new plates. However, this subtle change in presentation will allow us
to augment our presentation and improve everyone's experience.</p>
<p>By helping us buy these needed accessories, we'll be
afforded the opportunity to divert our limited resources into other areas like
staying current with bills and payroll, dressing up our space, pursuing our
liquor license, or developing new exciting menu items.</p>
<p>We've come a long way in the past seven months, and
that says a lot about the potential for not only us at the Vagabond Kitchen,
but for Wheeling’s ability to really get behind and support a downtown business
it believes in.</p>
<p><b>The Big Picture
&amp; Local Economy</b></p>
<p>The Kitchen is not just a place to eat. We offer a
unique experience and strive to be a valuable part of our community. As
Wheeling reinvents itself and we all seek a viable economy and healthy place to
live, grow, raise our children, and pursue our dreams, there is little more
important than funneling your hard-earned green back into local businesses.
Every dollar that goes outside the Ohio Valley does simply that while dollars
spent within the Valley continue to circulate and build foundations for our
future.</p>
<p>By supporting us, we can afford to support other local
ventures: farmers and producers, charities and organizations, people and
families.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You
Can Help</b></p>
<p>There are innumerable ways to help both the Kitchen and
Wheeling. In a city this size, one person truly can make a difference. Support
the growing positive action in our area. Contribute to something established,
or start your own. Know the path ahead may not be easy, but as challenging as
it may be, it will be even more rewarding.</p>

Ive been part of the fitness industry for over 4 years and helped many people towards their goals of getting into shape. Recently my father had heart surgery that ultimately was lead by the lifestyle he lived which did not consist of eating clean and exercising. Upon doing more research of his medical condition I've also discovered some alarming information. We in fact are dealing with an epidemic of obesity in America. The numbers are ""Astronomical"" and diseases associated with obesity, such as heart disease, cancer, and especially diabetes is surging. 31% of adults are obese and 15% of children and teenagers age 6-19 are overweight. And despite obesity being a problem for all groups and genders, it is particularly severe among certain groups. For instance, 50% of non-Hispanic black women are obese. The numbers are shocking and unless we take control now, its only going to get worse. So I decided to be part of the solution and started LueFit to combat the problem. I currently work with 8 people under LueFit and they've made huge progress losing an average of 10 pounds a month by exercising and eating healthier. I am so happy and thrilled to be part of their achievements, however my goal is to help a lot more, especially the youth in our area.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We're Marianne Murphy (English) and Pepijn van der Knaap (Dutch). We met 5 years ago in the UK where together we ran the kitchen of a busy pub alongside catering for numerous private events and dinners. Six months ago we decided to return to Pepijn's mother country The Netherlands and moved to the capital Amsterdam</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Coming Home</h2>
<p>The feeling of 'coming home' was slightly tainted by noticing the changes that have been taking place over the last decade. The European economy is facing a difficult time and as a result unemployment figures have reached record highs. With a population of 16 million people, a vast one million Dutch now live at or under poverty levels. The National Foodbank hands out 1,200,000 food parcels yearly and is sadly our fastest growing bank.</p>

<p>North Soccer Club (NSC) was established in 1992 to provide a competitive travel soccer program for the youth of North Attleborough, Massachusetts.  NSC competes in BAYS for the Fall and Spring outdoor seasons with our Winter season taking place at a variety of facilities throughout Southeastern Massachusetts and Northern Rhode Island. </p>
<p>The club also runs Fall and Spring Academy programs for grades K-2, introducing these players to the game and developing the skills needed to move into competitive travel Soccer.</p>
<p>Devoted to maintaining this level of competition and success, NSC strives to provide reliable facilities and services to those interested in the game. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Our Situation</b></h3>
<p>Our fields need some work, to say the least. This past spring was the worst they've been in recent memory.  We are now in the process of implementing a <i>series of fundraising campaigns to renew and rebuild our fields.</i></p>
<p>With your help, we hope to improve the conditions of the fields and ultimately, the satisfaction of our players and families. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Plan</span></h3>
<p>For the purpose of renovating our facilities, we need your help and support. The renovations will occur periodically based on the money raised during each phase of the campaign. Our initial goal of $30,000 will help fund the following improvements:</p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">PHASE  1 – FALL 2014</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>·  Renovating the U10 and U12 fields at Amvet </p>
<p>·  Repair irrigation system at Amvet</p>
<p>·  Work with NA Electric to install flood lights on the poles at Amvet to allow for practices when dark</p>
<p>·  Develop and document a yearly maintenance plan and have contractual obligations in place for that work (Amvet and Rose)</p>
<div><br/></div>
<i>In order to fund the next two phases of the renovations, the subsequent campaigns will allow for the following improvements starting in September 2014: </i>

</li></ul>
<p>·  Renovating the U9 field at Amvet</p>
<p>·  Renovate track area at Amvet  (will become the new home of NSC Academy)</p>
<br/><p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">PHASE 3 – FALL 2015</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>·  Install fencing at Amvet</p>
<p>·  Repair fencing at Rose</p>
<p>·  Install sheds at Amvet and Rose</p>
<p>·  Install permanent team benches at Amvet and Rose</p>
<p>·  Install bleacher style seating at Rose</p>
<br/><h3><b>Risk</b></h3>
<p>Our goals and timelines are aggressive.  The initial campaign amount will not cover the entire renovation, which is why we have implemented the separate phases of fundraising. </p>
<p>The amount we plan to raise seems like a considerably large sum of money, however, we believe that with your help it can become a possibility. Our goal will provide us with the minimum amount we need to successfully fund these fields.  </p>
<p>Throughout this campaign, you have the commitment of the NSC board to continue to look for donations of services, time, equipment, etc, not just funding. This is just part of what we are doing and your help is greatly appreciated.  </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Along with your donation, it would be a huge help to us if you ""like"" the Facebook page <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NorthSoccerClub"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Facebook.com/NorthSoccerClub</a> and invite others to like it as well! Communicating our goals and incentives to as many people as possible is important. Spread the word! </p>
<p>We are also looking for supporters who can provide product to NSC such as loam, seed and fertilizer or services such as field repair, fence installation, sign installation, etc.  If you can provide any of these services please email president@northsoccerclub.com</p>
<p>Lastly, any questions regarding this campaign or future plans can be directed to Chris Hinckley, NSC President, at <b>president@northsoccerclub.com</b>.</p>

PHASE 2 – SPRING 2015

·  Renovating the U9 field at Amvet
·  Renovate track area at Amvet  (will become the new home of NSC Academy)


PHASE 3 – FALL 2015

·  Install fencing at Amvet
·  Repair fencing at Rose
·  Install sheds at Amvet and Rose
·  Install permanent team benches at Amvet and Rose
·  Install bleacher style seating at Rose
Risk
Our goals and timelines are aggressive.  The initial campaign amount will not cover the entire renovation, which is why we have implemented the separate phases of fundraising. 
The amount we plan to raise seems like a considerably large sum of money, however, we believe that with your help it can become a possibility. Our goal will provide us with the minimum amount we need to successfully fund these fields.  
Throughout this campaign, you have the commitment of the NSC board to continue to look for donations of services, time, equipment, etc, not just funding. This is just part of what we are doing and your help is greatly appreciated.  

Other Ways You Can Help
Along with your donation, it would be a huge help to us if you ""like"" the Facebook page www.Facebook.com/NorthSoccerClub and invite others to like it as well! Communicating our goals and incentives to as many people as possible is important. Spread the word! 
We are also looking for supporters who can provide product to NSC such as loam, seed and fertilizer or services such as field repair, fence installation, sign installation, etc.  If you can provide any of these services please email president@northsoccerclub.com
Lastly, any questions regarding this campaign or future plans can be directed to Chris Hinckley, NSC President, at president@northsoccerclub.com.

            Asthma Sentinel aggregates data from many sources, then runs this data through machine learning algorithms to find patterns and trends in your locations, behaviors, and activities. Using this data, Asthma Sentinel can determine if an attack is possible given your location and activities.<br/><br/>
            
            Asthma Sentinel is already collecting data across the country. Data has been collected since January 2014. In addition, we have found several sources of archived data, which we have already imported into Asthma Sentinel's database.<br/><img alt=""Asthma Sentinel Data Collection"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://asthmasentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Data-Collection-Circle.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Asthma Sentinel Data Collection""/><br/><strong>Jump To:</strong> <a href=""#mainfeatures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Main Features</a> | <a href=""#why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why We Made It</a> | <a href=""#perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perks</a> | <a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FAQs</a><br/><br/></p>

            In making Asthma Sentinel, we have three rules that we adhere to:
            </p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Make it for sufferers of Asthma and Allergies</strong> - Sometimes it's easy to add so many features and widgets, that the primary reason for the app can get lost. We focus solely on what is necessary for tracking and using data from asthma and allergy sufferers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Make it for busy people</strong> - Let's face it. Everyone is busy. Asthma Sentinel runs in the background tracking your location, weather, and more. You only need to launch the app if you want to record your activities. Asthma Sentinel warns you with alerts on your mobile device when possible triggers have been identified.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sleek design</strong> - You want an app that looks modern, is responsive, and just works.</li>

            With Asthma Sentinel, you can:

<li>Automatically track your location, and time per day of visit (NOTE: This data is <u><strong>never</strong></u> shared with anyone)</li>

<li>In November 2013, Philip's daughter, Hannah, had her first asthma attack. She was 18 months old. She was rushed to the hospital when her breathing became too difficult. At the time, the doctors weren't sure if it was asthma or a more common childhood disease called Bronchiolitis.</li>
<li>In January 2014, Hannah had her second asthma attack. Another trip to the ER, this one requiring stronger medications and several hours to get her breathing back to normal. She was 20 months old.</li>
<li>In early April 2014, Hannah had her third and most serious asthma attack. She stayed in the pediatric ICU for a week, on oxygen and medications 24/7 for the first few days. </li>
</ul>
            After her second attack, we started writing Asthma Sentinel to track her activities and find possible triggers for her asthma attacks. It took four months of work to find the data sources, build the machine learning algorithms, and regression testing, before Asthma Sentinel was ready - for Hannah.<br/><br/>
            When Hannah had her third attack, Asthma Sentinel's machine learning algorithms were able to identify changes in weather conditions as the culprit for her attacks. Her doctors agreed the weather was the most likely trigger for her attacks.<br/><br/>
            Our goal for this campaign is make Asthma Sentinel available for everyone to use. Everyone deserves to know in advance if a possible asthma or allergy trigger could affect them.

            As our developer Mark says, ""When you download Asthma Sentinel, it creates 10 tiny scientists inside of your device. If one of them feels an urge to sneeze, he pulls a wire which causes your on-screen indicator to display a warning. If all of the scientists sneeze at the same time, you get a much bigger warning. Of course, you have to supply tissues to the scientists after an event like this.""<br/><br/>
            How it really works - Asthma Sentinel gathers data for weather, pollen, pollution, AQI, flu and cold trends, and more, for your area and areas you have visited while using Asthma Sentinel, in addition to tracking your activities. When the machine learning A.I. determines that an attack or symptom is likely in your area or for a given event, you receive a warning.<br/><br/><strong>Will it tell me whether I am at risk when I go outside?</strong><br/>
            Yes, Asthma Sentinel will warn you hours before you go outside. It will even warn you when you are outside, if new data has been calculated after you stepped outside.<br/><br/><strong>Are there events or activities Asthma Sentinel might miss?</strong><br/>
            At present, Asthma Sentinel is not omniscient. It only knows about places you've been, activities you've logged, and the associated data for those activities and locations. Asthma Sentinel can warn you about weather and outside conditions, but it may not have enough data about a new place the first time you visit it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Jump To:</strong> <a href=""#technology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technology</a> | <a href=""#mainfeatures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Main Features</a> | <a href=""#why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why We Made It</a> | <a href=""#perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perks</a><br/><br/></p></div>","Asthma Sentinel tracks your location, activities, local weather, pollen, pollution, and more, to give you advanced warnings of situations which might trigger

When the machine learning A.I. determines that an attack or symptom is likely in your area or for a given event, you receive a warning.Will it tell me whether I am at risk when I go outside?
            Yes, Asthma Sentinel will warn you hours before you go outside. It will even warn you when you are outside, if new data has been calculated after you stepped outside.Are there events or activities Asthma Sentinel might miss?
            At present, Asthma Sentinel is not omniscient. It only knows about places you've been, activities you've logged, and the associated data for those activities and locations. Asthma Sentinel can warn you about weather and outside conditions, but it may not have enough data about a new place the first time you visit it.Jump To: Technology | Main Features | Why We Made It | Perks",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

Whoever joins our event and starts talking about their hobbies on Tokata through our Reward
Program will be able to simply get a share of our profit.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h4>How the idea of a profit sharing SNS started.</h4>
<p>In Tokata users can leverage the content they
already have on other social networks.<br/>
The problem that we see nowadays is that the social networks we use aren't
giving back to society a share of their profits. While they seem to grow bigger
year after year we haven’t seen any of them to share that with their users. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1270273/files/20150305024053-sns_service.png?1425552053"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Big social networks like Facebook and Twitter
are getting a lot of profit and rely on their users being active. You, as a
user however, won’t see anything of the profit. But, what if you could take
bite out of that profit?</p>

We
feel that if we created a community than we should show the users our gratitude
which is why we decided to launch the first so-called Reward-SNS. </div><div>Three principles of a Reward SNS</div><div>
<p>1. 
<u>Accessibility</u> : The users shouldn't have to rely on using a website or application.</p>
<p>2. 
<u>Rationality</u> : The user should get a reasonable
reward for its efforts.</p>
<p>3. 
<u>Durability</u> : Revenue for the user has to
increase constantly.</p>
<p>In other words we feel it’s only
reasonable and fair to be able to share the company profits in an easy and
convenient way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The difference of a revenue sharing program</h3>
<p>In the current market there exists things like
CPC (cost per click), CPP (cost per point), CPI (cost per install) and various
affiliate programs but for the general public such earning schemes don’t exist.
For those that have installed Tokata will be able to talk about their hobbies
and make a decent earning, simple and fast.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How to participate in the revenue sharing
program</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1. 
Help us fund this through Indiegogo with any
amount you’d like and manage a fanclub of your choosing.</p>
<p>2. 
After funding please install the ToKaTa

After the funding round has ended we will first

<p>4. 
Within your fanclub interact with your members
and feel free to invite others to join your fanclub <br/>
*Tokata supports Facebook fanpages, so people can log in with Facebook and they will automatically be connected to their corresponding fanclubs on Tokata.</p>
<p>5. 
Profits will be distributed among those that
manage a fanclub and according to the membercount.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">6.  Those
that participated in this program and bring in the highest number of people for
their fanclubs will receive an extra price which is explained in detail in our

Particular fields of interests like;
powerbloggers, forum enthusiasts or just those that want earn an extra income.</p>
<p>2. 
For those that really feel like “It sounds fun

My name is Nathan Fortin,
I am a young 28 year old dad from Montreal.
I work hard every day and trying to make my way with a smile.
As life in this world sometimes cost more than what we gain, when the bills are paid, there are only occasional crumbs.
With these crumbs, often decides to smile those you love around you, being a dad.
I have always found it important and what I want you also to have a goal in life. 

My smile, in my case, I did not get a chance to see him a few years by a full uncomfortable pretending. 
Being dentally handicapped from birth. 
I have neglected nothing awkwardly. 
He has already caught people's childhood.
It cost me more than $ 5,000 to have a smile that matches the one I dream of giving people around me.                                                                    
If you really know that . 
You give a smile.
Thank you.
Nathan

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>After finding out news that Evelyn was facing much more challenges than we first thought.. We held out hope.. But she was not able to overcome everything and passed away January 27th 2013. We believe that she is in the comforting arms of God. Although she was here for 19 days she forever changed the hearts of so many. </p>
<p>This campaign has turned into help for funeral expenses. We Thank you for supporting and praying for sweet Evelyn.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who is Baby Evelyn?</h3>
<p>Baby Evelyn is my cousin, she was born weighing 5lbs., 7 oz., and 17inches on Tuesday, January 8th.  Evelyn was scheduled to have heart surgery on January 14th because she was born with atrioventricular canal defect.  Her surgery had to be postponed, so the doctors can review all her tests and have a better understanding of what can be done to help her.  As of today January 17th the family was informed that she would need an additional surgery on her pulmonary arteries to remove tissue that is blocking it. Evelyn's family is being incredibly strong with the Hope that Evelyn will receive her surgery and be able to come home soon.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I am starting this campaign to help give her family some relief.  Though I feel helpless in this situation, I want to raise enough money to ease some of the financial stress regarding transportation to hospital, unexpected bills, and wages loss from missing work. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have set a goal of $2,000.  I have never been in this situation, but I know the last thing I would want to spend my time thinking about is money when my baby is sick.  We will do our best to keep you updated on her progress and when she has surgery. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help.</p>
<p>If you are not in the position to make a monetary donation, that is okay.  We ask that you pray for baby Evelyn and pass this message on to your friends &amp; family.  Thank you.</p>

<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<p><strong>*Why is my credit card not working?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo uses <em>PayPal</em> as a credit card payment processor, and PayPal does not support Lebanon among 19 other countries. In agreement with Indiegogo, we have developed a separate payment gateway to receive contributions from these countries. All the money will be transfered into the Indiegogo website at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>If your country is not supported by <em>PayPal, </em>you can contribute to the campaign here: <a href=""http://instabeat.me/payment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://instabeat.me/payment/</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>What is <em>Instabeat</em>?</strong></p>
<p><span><em>Instabeat</em> is the first modular, all-in-one training monitor adapted to the intricate biomechanics of swimming.</span></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""How does it work"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/728111/pictures/original/20130328031546-Screen_Shot_2013-03-27_at_7.27.39_PM.png?1364465750"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do I need to monitor my heart-rate during swimming?</strong></p>
<p>Measuring your heart-rate during your exercise is the optimal way of assessing how effective your workout is. It is a direct indication of whether your body is responding to your training and reaching your target, and a tool for you to decide whether you should maintain the same effort, push harder or take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>How does the technology work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Instabeat</em> has developed a (patent-pending) optical sensor that can accurately read the heart rate from the temporal artery.</p>
<p><img alt=""Temporal artery"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/735914/pictures/original/20130402072312-Temporal_Artery.jpg?1364912597"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The mechanical casing is designed to be flat so that:</p>
<p>The sensor is always positioned over the temple area on any head, allowing it to constantly read the heart rate from any head frame.<span style=""color: #ff0000;""><br/></span></p>
<p>The device stays in place despite the constant motion.</p>
<p><em>Instabeat</em> has multiple embedded motion sensors, that in addition to calculating the calories, flip turns and breathing pattern, act as a filter to reduce the noise created by the motion of the head, ensuring the accuracy of the heart rate reading.</p>
<p><strong>What parameters can I monitor with <em>Instabeat</em>?</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to monitor your heart-rate in real-time all throughout your training. Instabeat will turn on automatically as soon as it detects a heart rate and will only turn off once it is off your head.</p>
<p>On the dashboard, you will be able to see any other heart-rate feature such as your average or maximum heart rate, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Laps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flip Turns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathing Pattern</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What about shipping charges?</strong></p>
<p>Shipping costs are included in the price. For customs duty - please check the policy in your country. </p>
<p><strong>How is <em>Instabeat</em> different from what's available in the market?</strong></p>
<p><em>Instabeat</em> is the first heads-up display that is designed to be perfectly adapted to the complicated mechanics of swimming. <em>Instabeat</em>’s differentiation lies in the combination of belt-free, non- intrusive heart rate measurement with real-time visual feedback </p>
<p>Lap and stroke counting devices are essential, however they only refect on your exercise and not on your body's response to that exercise. Real-time feedback of your heart rate will allow you to make better training decisions, understand your body better and optimize your swim.</p>
<p><img alt=""Competition Table"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/735758/pictures/original/20130402050302-Indiegogo_Competition.jpg?1364904185"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Does <em>Instabeat</em> work on any head size and any goggle frame?</strong></p>
<p><em>Instabeat</em> is designed so that it fits all head sizes and goggle frames.</p>
<p><strong>Will <em>Instabeat</em>'s optical light sensor work in the sun? On bright days? In open water?</strong></p>
<p>We have tested our sensor in all of these different conditions and have succedeed in making it work anywhere at anytime.</p>
<p><strong>Will <em>Instabeat</em> work with a swimming cap?</strong></p>
<p>At Instabeat, we like swimming with our cap under our goggles- and that works perfectly fine. But if you like wearing yours above, that works too, just make sure you put it over the clip.</p>
<p><strong>Will <em>Instabeat</em> sync with my Android or iPhone?</strong></p>
<p>For this first version, Instabeat syncs with your dashboard through the USB port; the data is stored and then synced across all your devices. However, if we hit the 100K mark, we will add the bluetooth edtion perk, and you will be able to sync your device directly to your phone! Help us get there faster! </p>
<p><strong>Can I upgrade my Perk at a later stage?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who is the team behind <em>Instabeat</em>? </strong></p>
<p><em>Instabeat</em> is a sports technology startup based in Lebanon, founded in 2011 by Hind Hobeika out of a need for a heart rate monitoring device for her swimming practices. Find out more on <a href=""http://instabeat.me/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://instabeat.me/about</a></p>

Instabeat is a ground breaking heads-up display that monitors your heart rate, calories, laps and turns during your swim. 
'a breakthrough in the swimming world' WSJ   WIRED UK   Huffington Post   TED   Quantified Self

Real-time tracking is crucial to achieve your training and fitness goals, but at the same time it shouldn't disturb your head and arm motion during your swim. Instabeat's sleek design reduces friction in the water.
It fits on any pair of swimming goggles

 Instabeat is designed to fit on your favorite pair of goggles.
It reads your heart rate from the temporal artery, getting rid of the (oh, so annoying) chest belt!

 The sensor automatically turns on when the device is placed on your head.
It projects a color on your lenses in real-time to know how close you are from your target zone

Each color has three levels to indicate whether you are in the beginning, middle or upper limit of the zone.

Instabeat is the must have for every single swimmer:
It also measures your calories, number of laps and flip turns and syncs with your personal dashboard to track your progress over time. 
 
This first version syncs to the dashboard through your USB port.
Features

Hydrodynamic
Minimal Friction
Waterproof
Sleek
Easy to use (no ON/OFF buttons)
Comfortable to wear
Real-time accurate Heart Rate feedback

Specs

Size: 14 mm L x 5.3 mm W x 5.2 mm H
Weight: 30g
Heart Rate Accuracy: 97%
Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery: 8 hours

 
We love swimming and we think it's time to revolutionize the way we swim!
Swimming is one of the only two complete sports, that lenghtens your muscles, tones your body 12 times more and makes you burn 5 times more calories than running for the same effort!
We are done trying to adapt technologies for bikers and runners to the water, it's time we did things OUR way! 
 
Whether you are a professional swimmer or just looking to get fit, Instabeat will help you reach your goal.
 
Awards
We were the first prize winners of the MIT Enterprise Forum Pan Arab Business Plan Competition (2012) and the third prize winner of the Stars of Science competition organized by Qatar Foundation (2010).

We are one of the hottest startups in the Pan Arab region!
Where we are now:
Over the past year and half, we have developed 7 different versions of the prototype, and after extensive testing, we are finally happy with the current design and have a prototype that is ready to be manufactured. 
And now, we need you so we can:

Convert our prototype to production-ready models
Get all the regulatory approvals
Place our first production orders with our manufacturing partners

You will be able to monitor your heart-rate in real-time all throughout your training. Instabeat will turn on automatically as soon as it detects a heart rate and will only turn off once it is off your head.
On the dashboard, you will be able to see any other heart-rate feature such as your average or maximum heart rate, but also:


Laps


Flip Turns


Breathing Pattern


What about shipping charges?
Shipping costs are included in the price. For customs duty - please check the policy in your country. 
How is Instabeat different from what's available in the market?
Instabeat is the first heads-up display that is designed to be perfectly adapted to the complicated mechanics of swimming. Instabeat’s differentiation lies in the combination of belt-free, non- intrusive heart rate measurement with real-time visual feedback 
Lap and stroke counting devices are essential, however they only refect on your exercise and not on your body's response to that exercise. Real-time feedback of your heart rate will allow you to make better training decisions, understand your body better and optimize your swim.

Does Instabeat work on any head size and any goggle frame?
Instabeat is designed so that it fits all head sizes and goggle frames.
Will Instabeat's optical light sensor work in the sun? On bright days? In open water?
We have tested our sensor in all of these different conditions and have succedeed in making it work anywhere at anytime.
Will Instabeat work with a swimming cap?
At Instabeat, we like swimming with our cap under our goggles- and that works perfectly fine. But if you like wearing yours above, that works too, just make sure you put it over the clip.
Will Instabeat sync with my Android or iPhone?
For this first version, Instabeat syncs with your dashboard through the USB port; the data is stored and then synced across all your devices. However, if we hit the 100K mark, we will add the bluetooth edtion perk, and you will be able to sync your device directly to your phone! Help us get there faster! 
Can I upgrade my Perk at a later stage?

Who is the team behind Instabeat? 
Instabeat is a sports technology startup based in Lebanon, founded in 2011 by Hind Hobeika out of a need for a heart rate monitoring device for her swimming practices. Find out more on http://instabeat.me/about

<p><i>""We are deeply disappointed with the judgement of the Court and though it has ruled that it is beyond its judiciary function to help the lgbt community, we are thankful that the justices have taken the time to consider this appeal in detail.

We hope that we and the many other LGBT couples who are increasingly telling their stories will help others, and we hope that Singaporeans will see this as a minor setback for equality and fairness, and that we can as a country recognise the value of LGBT people. <br/><br/>We would like to thank the many people who have supported us on this fight. From the many who have donated funds to the legal case, to those who have contributed their knowledge and expertise.

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h3>
<p>S377A of the Penal Code states that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">""Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.""</p>
<p>Singapore is one of the few Asian countries, and the only advanced economy in the world, which still criminalises homosexuality. We believe this constitutional challenge is a rare opportunity to set things right and take our place among the many Asian and first world nations that do not have such a law.</p>
<p>While the Government of Singapore has said that S377A would not be proactively enforced, the fact is that is has been used, and its existence is a threat to all gay men. As it is, S377A - even if unenforced - also stands in the way of the fight against discrimination of the entire LGBT community in society, at the workplace, as well as the way LGBT people are portrayed in the mass media.</p>

<p>My name is Kristina. In December, I will be joining Power Forward International Inc, (<a href=""http://www.pfii.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pfii.org</a>) on a trip to Haiti. There, I will help run a basketball camp, where 200 children from all over the country will have the opportunity to learn the game and impress some coaches. </p>
<p>Through these camps (there have been 4 to date,) 19 Haitian athletes have been ""discovered"" and brought to the United States schools on full academic scholarships. All these young men are great students (only those with a 3.0 GPA average are invited to attend these camps,) and have amazing athletic abilities; qualities that athletic programs in the US look for.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, a large percentage of these boys don't even have sneakers or basketballs to play and learn the game. But it is so important for them to continue improving their skills since basketball may be their only way to a better future. </p>
<p>Although this will be my first participation, Power Forward International Inc, has already organized 4 basketball camps and found a lot of talented young men (19 as mentioned above,) all of whom have excelled academically and in basketball in their respective institutions. </p>
<p>I would really love to surprise the participants of the camp with as many pairs of new basketball sneakers and basketballs as I can. Especially that its Christmas time, too! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHERE THE MONEY GOES</b></p>
<p>The average price of a good pair of basketball sneakers is $80 and $30 for a basketball. </p>
<p>My MINIMUM goal is to bring:</p>
<p>- 10 basketballs - 10x$30 = $300</p>
<p>- 30 pairs of sneakers - $50/pair (discounted rate) - 30x$50 = $1500</p>
<p>- minus $180 for Indiegogo take away fees</p>
<p>I am working on securing either a wholesale discount or a a quantity discount so that every dollar you donate goes as far as it can. It would be wonderful to be able to bring a new pair of sneakers to every participant and to give everyone a basketball. </p>
<p>Everyone who contributes will receive:</p>
<p>- a break down of the pairs of sneakers and basketballs that were purchased.</p>
<p>- a picture of camp participants with their new sneakers and basketballs.</p>
<p>- a thank you note from the child your money bought sneakers and basketballs for.</p>
<p>- a Power Forward International Inc. rubber support bracelet.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, I simply won't be able to buy as any pairs of sneakers as I would like. </p>
<p><b>MONEY ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO CONTRIBUTE</b></p>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, that's ok. There are so many other ways to help. Tell 10 people you know about my efforts and help spread the word. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools. </p>

Although this will be my first participation, Power Forward International Inc, has already organized 4 basketball camps and found a lot of talented young men (19 as mentioned above,) all of whom have excelled academically and in basketball in their respective institutions. 
I would really love to surprise the participants of the camp with as many pairs of new basketball sneakers and basketballs as I can. Especially that its Christmas time, too! 

WHERE THE MONEY GOES
The average price of a good pair of basketball sneakers is $80 and $30 for a basketball. 
My MINIMUM goal is to bring:
- 10 basketballs - 10x$30 = $300
- 30 pairs of sneakers - $50/pair (discounted rate) - 30x$50 = $1500
- minus $180 for Indiegogo take away fees
I am working on securing either a wholesale discount or a a quantity discount so that every dollar you donate goes as far as it can. It would be wonderful to be able to bring a new pair of sneakers to every participant and to give everyone a basketball. 
Everyone who contributes will receive:
- a break down of the pairs of sneakers and basketballs that were purchased.
- a picture of camp participants with their new sneakers and basketballs.
- a thank you note from the child your money bought sneakers and basketballs for.
- a Power Forward International Inc. rubber support bracelet.
If I don't reach my entire goal, I simply won't be able to buy as any pairs of sneakers as I would like. 
MONEY ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO CONTRIBUTE
If you can't contribute financially, that's ok. There are so many other ways to help. Tell 10 people you know about my efforts and help spread the word. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools.

<h2>
<b>THE SCIENCE OF </b><b>eSiddha<strong>℠</strong>DigiMed<strong><strong>™</strong></strong></b>
</h2>
<p>eSiddha℠ DigiMed™ revolutionary model of wellness services works on the following basis:<br/>1- The principle of subtle-energy,<br/>2- The principle of sound and image patterns,<br/>3- And the eSiddha℠ DigiMed™ principle.</p>
<p><strong>1. The principle of Subtle Energy:</strong><br/>The Ancients have long known and used the principle of subtle energy for the well-being of the body and mind. Subtle energy is termed as Chi in china, Prana in India and Qi in japan. Today, many modern scientists have acknowledged the scientific basis of subtle energy and published their work to support its use. “Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis” written by a renowned scientist, James L. Oschman, provides a scientific explanation of Subtle Energetic Exchanges in all therapies. “Life Force, the Scientific Basis” by Dr. Claude Swanson, physicist at MIT and Princeton University, is an outstanding account of Subtle Energies. “Science and human Transformation” by Dr. Williams A. Tiller, a professor of Material Sciences and Engineering at Stanford University and a proponent in the field of psychoenergetics, addresses subtle energies beyond the four fundamental forces. The International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine’s website, found at (<a href=""http://www.issseem.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.issseem.org</a>), holds a very rich resource on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>2. The principle of Sound and Image Patterns:</strong><br/>The Ancients have provisioned the use of sound and image patterns, known as mantras and yantras as key instruments carrying subtle energy used for the wellness of the mind and body. In modern times, Cymatic (the study of the relationship between sound vibration and geometric shapes), pioneered by Swiss scientist Hans Jenny, has evolved to Cymatherapy. Cymatherapy was initiated by Dr. Peter Guy Manners and it uses sound and images for the mind and body wellbeing. In his book “Messages from Water” Masaru Emoto, a Japanese researcher, published his extensive work on how the mind, thoughts and emotions can change the form of water crystals.</p>
<p><strong>3. The principle of Memory Signature:</strong><br/>Jacques Benveniste’s, a French immunologist who was awarded two “ig” Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, published an article in 1988 that had attracted a huge attention, mainly because it hinted at a potential mechanism that could be used to explain how homeopathy works. Just like the idea that water may somehow retain the <em>memory</em> of a substance that it no longer contains. So far, homeopathy uses <em>manual methods with human intervention</em> for its capture and transmission process.</p>
<p>On the basis of these three principles, eSiddha℠DigiMed™ has revolutionized a proprietary formulation process that consists of capturing the subtle-energy signature of wellness solution, transmitting it, and then activating it into a digital geometrical and audio pattern. This innovation is a new frontier into combining modern science with ancient energy technology. This is the beginning of a revolution in the digital world where wellness solutions can be reproduced digitally.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">OUR STORY</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>
<b></b>
</div>
<p>Sri Pranaji has made a bold attempt to revolutionize the concept of subtle energy by bringing it into the digital world, through the invention of a very sophisticated DigiMed™ proprietary process. This innovation is a frontier between methods of modern science and ancient energy technology. This is the beginning of a new revolution in the digital world, where wellness solutions can be reproduced through digital transmission.</p>
<p>DigiMed™ has been under development for the last 15 years and has undergone many tests until finally, it was optimized and perfected so as to achieve wellness goals. In the early stages, this technology has faced many challenges, especially when it came to creating the digital images and audio tracks responsible for recreating energy from a mobile device. The breakthrough emerged upon successfully implanting subtle-energy into a digital image filled with audio to recreate the similar energy pattern of the intended substance. DigiMed™ wellness solutions are successful and time-tested thanks to their unprecedented effectiveness and at the same time their safeness to the environment.</p>
<p>To ensure optimum delivery of DigiMed™ to clients, the eSiddha℠ breakthrough model of online service delivery, i.e, Click &amp; Cure! has been developed to enable full access to DigiMed™, in the most convenient way possible, to anyone, anytime, anywhere. eSiddha℠ has established a new paradigm in the holistic wellness industry, mainly its incomparable features which are: 24/7 online service availability, great practicality for its clear, simple and easy to use, it’s reliable and provides customers with free trials to try and judge for themselves on the spot. The eSiddha℠ model is cost effective as it provides the best value for your money.</p>
<p>eSiddha℠ enables access to a wide variety of DigiMed™ including DigiMed™ of Night for Sleep, DigiMed™ of Venus for Beauty, DigiMed™ of Vigor for Man, DigiMed™ of Brain for Intelligence, DigiMed™ of Ease for Relief and DigiMed™ of Calm for Peace. This is just the tip of the iceberg as further research is underway and will bring about even more effective wellness solutions in cutting edge Digital Medicine.</p>

THE SCIENCE OF eSiddha℠DigiMed™

eSiddha℠ DigiMed™ revolutionary model of wellness services works on the following basis:1- The principle of subtle-energy,2- The principle of sound and image patterns,3- And the eSiddha℠ DigiMed™ principle.
1. The principle of Subtle Energy:The Ancients have long known and used the principle of subtle energy for the well-being of the body and mind. Subtle energy is termed as Chi in china, Prana in India and Qi in japan. Today, many modern scientists have acknowledged the scientific basis of subtle energy and published their work to support its use. “Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis” written by a renowned scientist, James L. Oschman, provides a scientific explanation of Subtle Energetic Exchanges in all therapies. “Life Force, the Scientific Basis” by Dr. Claude Swanson, physicist at MIT and Princeton University, is an outstanding account of Subtle Energies. “Science and human Transformation” by Dr. Williams A. Tiller, a professor of Material Sciences and Engineering at Stanford University and a proponent in the field of psychoenergetics, addresses subtle energies beyond the four fundamental forces. The International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine’s website, found at (www.issseem.org), holds a very rich resource on the subject.
2. The principle of Sound and Image Patterns:The Ancients have provisioned the use of sound and image patterns, known as mantras and yantras as key instruments carrying subtle energy used for the wellness of the mind and body. In modern times, Cymatic (the study of the relationship between sound vibration and geometric shapes), pioneered by Swiss scientist Hans Jenny, has evolved to Cymatherapy. Cymatherapy was initiated by Dr. Peter Guy Manners and it uses sound and images for the mind and body wellbeing. In his book “Messages from Water” Masaru Emoto, a Japanese researcher, published his extensive work on how the mind, thoughts and emotions can change the form of water crystals.
3. The principle of Memory Signature:Jacques Benveniste’s, a French immunologist who was awarded two “ig” Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, published an article in 1988 that had attracted a huge attention, mainly because it hinted at a potential mechanism that could be used to explain how homeopathy works. Just like the idea that water may somehow retain the memory of a substance that it no longer contains. So far, homeopathy uses manual methods with human intervention for its capture and transmission process.
On the basis of these three principles, eSiddha℠DigiMed™ has revolutionized a proprietary formulation process that consists of capturing the subtle-energy signature of wellness solution, transmitting it, and then activating it into a digital geometrical and audio pattern. This innovation is a new frontier into combining modern science with ancient energy technology. This is the beginning of a revolution in the digital world where wellness solutions can be reproduced digitally.




OUR STORY




Sri Pranaji has made a bold attempt to revolutionize the concept of subtle energy by bringing it into the digital world, through the invention of a very sophisticated DigiMed™ proprietary process. This innovation is a frontier between methods of modern science and ancient energy technology. This is the beginning of a new revolution in the digital world, where wellness solutions can be reproduced through digital transmission.
DigiMed™ has been under development for the last 15 years and has undergone many tests until finally, it was optimized and perfected so as to achieve wellness goals. In the early stages, this technology has faced many challenges, especially when it came to creating the digital images and audio tracks responsible for recreating energy from a mobile device. The breakthrough emerged upon successfully implanting subtle-energy into a digital image filled with audio to recreate the similar energy pattern of the intended substance. DigiMed™ wellness solutions are successful and time-tested thanks to their unprecedented effectiveness and at the same time their safeness to the environment.
To ensure optimum delivery of DigiMed™ to clients, the eSiddha℠ breakthrough model of online service delivery, i.e, Click & Cure! has been developed to enable full access to DigiMed™, in the most convenient way possible, to anyone, anytime, anywhere. eSiddha℠ has established a new paradigm in the holistic wellness industry, mainly its incomparable features which are: 24/7 online service availability, great practicality for its clear, simple and easy to use, it’s reliable and provides customers with free trials to try and judge for themselves on the spot. The eSiddha℠ model is cost effective as it provides the best value for your money.
eSiddha℠ enables access to a wide variety of DigiMed™ including DigiMed™ of Night for Sleep, DigiMed™ of Venus for Beauty, DigiMed™ of Vigor for Man, DigiMed™ of Brain for Intelligence, DigiMed™ of Ease for Relief and DigiMed™ of Calm for Peace. This is just the tip of the iceberg as further research is underway and will bring about even more effective wellness solutions in cutting edge Digital Medicine.

Please support me and follow my journey at <a href=""http://fiftytwofives.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fiftytwofives.com</a>!</p>
<p>GBS affects 1 in 100,000 people. It begins with weakness or tingling sensations in the legs, and can spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase until muscles cannot be used at all and the person is almost totally paralyzed. It can be life threatening.</p>
<p>My experience with GBS was tough. In a few days, I went from athletic to struggling to walk to the mailbox. It took too long to get diagnosed and I didn't know where to get help -- it was mentally very tough. I couldn't look after my family, and I wasn't able to work full-time. It took me over a year to get back to even close to normal, and around two years to run again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.gbs-cidp.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GBS/CIDP Foundation</a> is doing important work. 100% of the funds raised will be donated to the Foundation.

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">All ANTELOPE products are made of  multi-directional stretching compression fabrics, which insure that the integrated electrodes are constantly placed on the skin in the right position. These newest generation electrodes, which do not need any external electrolytes, are connected with special conductive cables on the inner side. The ANTELOPE BOOSTER activates the muscle contraction and is controlled by an app via Bluetooth. The app is the adjustment  and evaluation tool. It contains specially developed programs and settings (frequency, intensity levels, trainings length, speed, intervals, etc). Training data is saved and can easily be accessed. </div></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444335081/hozo0vfq90t2eub6ioay.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The primary feature of the BOOSTER is the number of muscle groups it can activate. To activate one muscle group (e.g. both biceps or both upper leg muscles) a pair of electrodes with positive and negative poles is required so that the current can flow out from one electrode, enter into the body and then leave at other electrode to complete the path. A device that activates only one muscle group is called 1-Channel device. The higher the number of the muscle groups that need to be activated the higher the number of channels the device needs to have. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are offering two different BOOSTERS, which differ in terms of the maximum number of muscles groups they can activate, technological complexity and consequential pricing points. For our supplementary products i.e. CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN'S DREAM and WING we use a 2-channel BOOSTER (“BOOSTER 2c”) as these products maximally activate two muscle groups. For our ANTELOPE SUIT we will use the 8-Channel solution (“BOOSTER 8c”) to stimulate whole body with electrodes placed on the arms, chest, belly, back, bottom, upper legs. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ANTELOPE has  further developed Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). This training technology has been scientifically proven to enhance sports performance. ANTELOPE  respects  the way your body works. It precisely mimics the processes that occur in our body when our brain directs muscles to contract. So its absolutely natural. But in case of EMS the stimulus occurs directly on the muscle and activates a much higher percentage of the fibers. Thats the secret why our ANTELOPE products are so effective.</p>

<h3><b>Risks
and challenges of the ANTELOPE project</b></h3>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Technology and d</b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ay-to-day testing</b></p>
<p>The
ANTELOPE Suit is a truly innovative breakthrough product combining different
areas of expertise such as textiles and electronics engineering, wiring,
software development and sport science. We want to give people, who are as
fascinated about EMS workout as we are, technically the best possible equipment
in terms of quality, design and feeling. We want you to use our products in different environments outside, at home, etc. To ensure that our products work in every applicable environment we are conducting rigorous testing in different conditions. </p>
<p>We have allowed time for the tests in our plans. Nonetheless, we do face risk that the
prototype tests being constantly carried out in-house reveal bugs or
suboptimal workflow of software or hardware resulting in required adjustments
and thus leading to delay in deliveries. Even though we are confident that our
team’s wide-ranging expertise in all relevant fields is extensive to address
all the challenges, we have established partnerships with leading specialist in
all critical areas of product development. Such set-up makes us confident that
we can handle risks associated with software and hardware development.</p>
<p><b>Safety</b></p>
<p>EMS
is a proven and hazard-free technology, which is widely supported by many
studies. It originates from the medical rehabilitation field and was initially
developed in the 60-ies. We will make sure our products comply with the highest
quality and safety standards and are completely safe to use. We will provide
the maximum comfort and reliability to our customers, however unforeseeable
improvements might result in some time delay.</p>
<p><b>Fitting</b></p>
<p>The
fitting of the textiles for every body type can be challenging as for perfect
conduction you need sufficient compression to ensure ultimate interaction of
the electrodes and the skin. We will offer a variety of sizes for both sexes to
secure the perfect fit of your ANTELOPE product. We also recognise the
importance of the comfort you, as our dedicated customer, require during your
workout. We are confident of finding the best possible solution in terms of
sizing and comfort for you.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Certification</b><br/></p>
<p>The delivery of the ANTELOPE series products is subject to certain certifications in the respective markets. We have installed internal quality management system that supports the timely implementation of the appropriate procedures. We are not only familiar with the respective requirements but are also supported by a dedicated consulting company specialising in international certification procedures for medical appliances and a member of the board of a DAX30 company in the field of medical R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The certification process for Europe, US and other relevant markets has started. We have obtained FCC certificate for Bluetooth communication and will complete CE Certification by the end of the year. The delivery of the products in Europe is planned to start February 2016. International shipments will take place after the appropriate clearance from the relevant government bodies has been received, e.g. early backers from the US who support us will only be able to receive an EMS-based perk only after we receive 510(k) clearance from FDA. </p>
<p>Even though we are confident that we are well prepared to handle the respective processes, we cannot eliminate the risk of delays due to compliance issues.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Supply
Chain Risks</b></p>
<p>ANTELOPE products are complex and
involve many parts. While we have dedicated team members covering sourcing and
supply chain, delays may occur if we face longer than expected lead times in
delivery of parts.</p>
<h3><b>FAQs</b></h3>
<p><b>Electrical stimulation sounds dangerous – but does is hurt!</b></p>
<p>ANTELOPE is an evolution of a proven technology called
TENS, which has been used for rehabilitation purposes for decades. Elicitation
of muscle contraction using electrical impulses is absolutely natural as such
elicitation precisely mimics the processes that occur in our body when our
brain directs muscles to contract. Every movement you accomplish in your
day-to-day life is triggered by a small electrical impulse generated by your
brain resulting in activation of the motor units of your muscles. That’s how
movements are generated! ANTELOPE has optimized this natural principle by placing
the electrodes directly on the muscles and thus intensifying every contraction
and your whole workout. Imagine taking a shower and directing the showerhead
with strong water beam from a short distance on your muscle – that’s how it
feels.</p>
<p><b>What are the benefits of the training with ANTELOPE?</b></p>
<p>The ANTELOPE products are generally made for everyone – no
matter how old or physically fit you are. ANTELOPE is the perfect choice for
(i) those who haven’t been physically active for a long time and who are
looking for a joint-friendly restart, (ii) athletes who want to optimize their
conventional training,  (iii) people with weight problems and (iv) elderly
looking to improve their overall condition.</p>
<p><b>What are the advantages of training with ANTELOPE?</b></p>
<p>Thanks to additional stimulation during each muscle contraction
the workout with ANTELOPE activates more than 95% of the muscle potential (vs.
70% during conventional workout). This has two major advantages: (i) for
identical training result less time is required and (ii) heavy weights are no
longer needed – there is no strain on the joints and, thus, the risk of various
injuries is minimized. In addition, the impact of external forces on the body
is reduced. ANTELOPE is the only tool on the market that can be incorporated
into any sports to specifically improve desired coordination patterns (e.g.
cycling, football or basketball) and thus directly enhance performance.</p>
<p><b>How often can I exercise with Antelope per week?</b></p>
<p>The number of training sessions per week depends on several
factors. The most important factors are the state of your health (incl. diet),
previous workout experience with EMS devices, what kind of workout you are
primarily doing and what type of the ANTELOPE product you are using.  </p>
<p>In general:</p>
<p>-  You should use ANTELOPE during your training routine
only in a healthy state due to the workout’s high intensity.</p>
<p>-  Beginners should generally start with lower current
intensities and increase them from session to session.</p>
<p>-  Time required for the body to regenerate is longer after
an exhaustive power training session (high current intensities) than after an
endurance specific training (lower supporting current intensities).</p>
<p>-  The more muscles you stimulate, the longer they need to
recover.</p>
<p>-  ANTELOPE SUIT (8 stimulated muscle groups on the whole
body): After exhaustive strength training sessions with the entire ANTELOPE
SUIT you should rest for at least 4 days within the first weeks of training so
that your body has enough time to recover fully. For advanced ANTELOPE SUIT
users maximum number of 2 - 3 exhaustive strength training sessions per week
can be recommended. Applying ANTELOPE during endurance training sessions
results in regeneration times being only half as long, i.e. twice the number of
sessions per week can be accomplished. In general, the number of sessions is
subject to the overall intensity of the workout.</p>
<p>-  CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN'S DREAM or WING (one or two stimulated muscle groups): Due to
reduced number of electrodes used during the workout more sessions can be
conducted per week accordingly.</p>
<p>Please note that when the body does not get enough time for its
muscle structures to recover the effect of the workout will be insignificant.
Therefore, breaks between workouts are extremely important and should be
adhered to especially at the beginning.</p>
<p><b>What’s the difference between ANTELOPE and the ab belts from TV
commercials?</b></p>
<p>The main difference is: ANTELOPE offers active, mobile and broad
(full body) stimulation vs. static, local and isolated stimulation. You can not
only integrate ANTELOPE into your favorite sports but also exercise with a
higher overall intensity.</p>
<p>Small devices (TENS) with adhesive electrodes and ab stimulating
belts are not suited for active training. Moreover just a limited number of
muscles can be stimulated. The positive and negative poles of these devices are
usually placed on only one muscle resulting in isolated stimulation of a small
amount of muscle fibers.</p>
<p>The placement of the electrodes in ANTELOPE products is
different. Positive and negative electrodes are not located on the same muscle
but on the opposite sides of the body, thus, not only stimulating the area
directly below the electrodes, but also the opponents (antagonists) and
stabilizers (synergists) at the same time. In addition, such approach activates
the underlying nerves, leading to stimulation of additional muscle groups. The
mobility feature of the ANTELOPE products allows to effectively improve
movement patterns of an athlete the sport specific abilities.</p>
<p><b>What are the contraindications of the ANTELOPE training?</b></p>
<p>Unless you are in good physical condition to go through a tough
workout please consult a doctor prior to training with the ANTELOPE products .</p>
<p>If one of the following health conditions is applicable to you,
you are unfortunately not allowed to use ANTELOPE products for safety reasons:</p>
<p>-  pacemaker or other electrical implants,</p>
<p>-  pregnancy,</p>
<p>-  severe neurological or cardiovascular diseases or any
types of cancer</p>
<p>Please note that you should abstain from physical exercising during
acute illness (fever, acute inflammatory processes or/and acute bacterial/viral
infections etc.) and recover completely first.</p>
<p><b>How do I use ANTELOPE and how do I steer it?</b></p>
<p>Our ANTELOPE app is the ultimate steering tool. We’ve been
working on it for a while to provide our users with individual support. The app
helps you to set the optimal training intensities, adapts them individually and
automatically with increasing training experience, increases/decreases the
training intensity based on the latest scientific findings and offers a huge
variety of sport specific use cases. We will be offering guided workouts,
videos, explanations, GPS tracking and a social media interface. To make it
easier for you to track your performance you will be awarded certain points
after every completed exercise. By continuously accumulating points you will be
able to track your workout success and adjust it according to your personal
goals. Your personal profile will include a training calendar, in which every
training session will be saved and can be viewed retroactively. We are
continuously working on new features to provide you more interaction and
variety for your workout.</p>
<p><b>How is it possible to use EMS during conventional sports like
running or biking?</b></p>
<p>To date all full-body EMS devices can be applied only
stationary. Such devices are also extremely expensive with pricing points above
USD 10,000. For this reason EMS is currently mainly used in specialized gyms.
ANTELOPE system is fully mobile, thus, removes the spatial boundaries and
brings EMS outdoors. We have developed special submaximal stimulation programs
for each specific sporting activity with training suggestions to avoid negative
influence on coordination during your exercise e.g. during cycling or running.
Pre-activation of all muscles and the positive effect of the electrical impulse
on the vascular system are the major drivers of the positive results for
endurance sports.</p>
<p><b>What about the correct fit and the sizes of the garment?</b></p>
<p>The textiles are available for each
sex in 4 different sizes (S, M, L, XL for men and XS, S, M, L for women).
The specially developed compressive garment of the ANTELOPE products fits very
tight and ensures a comfortable fit and proper positioning of the electrodes.
It offers multi-directional stretching that allows the textile to conform to
every curve of your body and move with you. The fabric is breathable,
antibacterial and machine washable.</p>

Elastizität des Stoffes an. Die elektrischen Impulse werden von einer
smartphonegroßen Elektronikeinheit – dem ANTELOPE BOOSTER – ausgelöst.
Reguliert wird dieser per App über Smartphone oder Tablet. Die App beinhaltet
verschiedene Trainingsprogramme und Einstellungen  unter anderem für
Frequenz, Intensität und Trainingsdauer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444598146/z79vdklixvbbvwtuevep.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Der ANTELOPE BOOSTER versetzt den Nutzer in die Lage, mehrere
Muskelgruppen zeitgleich zu stimulieren. Um eine Muskelgruppe zu aktivieren,
wird ein Elektrodenpaar, bestehend aus positivem und negativem Pol, benötigt.
Elektrischer Strom fließt zwischen den Polen durch die Muskulatur – ein
Kreislauf entsteht. Geräte zur Aktivierung einer einzigen Muskelgruppe werden
als Ein-Kanal-Geräte bezeichnet. Je höher die Anzahl der zu aktivierenden
Muskelgruppen, desto höher die Anzahl der nötigen Kanäle.</p>
<p>Wir bieten zwei Versionen des BOOSTERs an, die sich in der
Anzahl gleichzeitig aktivierbarer Muskelgruppen und folglich in der technischen
Komplexität sowie im Preis unterscheiden. Unsere Zusatzprodukte, wie CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN’S DREAM und WING, laufen mit dem 2-Kanal-BOOSTER
(„BOOSTER 2c“) und können maximal zwei Muskelgruppen gleichzeitig aktivieren.
Für den ANTELOPE SUIT hingegen bauen wir auf die 8-Kanal-Elektronik („BOOSTER
8c“), um Arme, Brust, Bauch, Rücken, Gesäß und Oberschenkel (Beinbizeps und
Quadrizeps) gleichzeitig zu stimulieren. </p>

<p>Die ANTELOPE Series ist eine Weiterentwicklung der
EMS-Technologie. Bei dieser hocheffektiven und zeitsparenden Trainingsmethode
wird die natürliche Muskelkontraktion durch elektrische Impulse unterstützt.
Sowohl bei ANTELOPE als auch bei EMS wird durch einen externen Reiz eine Kontraktion
ausgelöst. Dabei können die Muskeln keinen Unterschied zwischen einer
willkürlichen Kontraktion (ausgelöst durch das Gehirn) und einer elektrisch
induzierten Kontraktion feststellen: die geleistete Arbeit ist genau die
gleiche – ganz natürlich, nur viel effektiver. </p>

<p>Alle Prototypen der revolutionären ANTELOPE Series wurden von
unserem internen Expertenteam entwickelt. In Kooperation mit einem starken
Netzwerk aus Partnern und Beratern aus den Bereichen Elektrotechnik, Verkabelung und Textilingenieurwesen haben wir die unserer Meinung nach beste
Lösung zur Fertigung der ANTELOPE Series gefunden. Neben der Entwicklung von
Textil und Hardware haben wir auch die ANTELOPE App entworfen, getestet und von
Version zu Version verbessert, um Nutzer so gut und detailliert wie möglich
beim Training zu unterstützen. Die App ermöglicht die Kontrolle der
Trainingsintensität und Einsicht in den eigenen Trainingsverlauf. Zusätzlich
bietet der Kontrollbildschirm die Option, sich über Erfolge und Vitaldaten zu
informieren und diese zu bewerten. Wir arbeiten bereits daran, in einer
zukünftigen Version der ANTELOPE App personalisierte Trainingsprogramme mit
virtuellen Trainern und Trainingsplänen zu integrieren. Wir möchten eine
Community gründen, die die Interaktion mit Personal Trainern und den Wettkampf
der Athleten untereinander fördert. Hier soll man sich über aktuelle
Trainingserfolge, -methoden oder Ernährungspläne austauschen können.</p>

<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>Risiken und Herausforderungen
des Projekts</b></h3>
<p><b>Technologie</b></p>
<p>Als bahnbrechendstes Innovationsprodukt unserer Zeit kombiniert
ANTELOPE die Bereiche Textil- und Elektrotechnik mit Leiterlegung und
Verkabelung, Softwareentwicklung und Sportwissenschaft. Unser Ziel ist es,
sport- und besonders EMS-begeisterten Menschen das Bestmögliche in Sachen
Qualität, Design und Feeling zu bieten. Trotz all unserer Bemühungen besteht
immer die Möglichkeit, dass sich im internen Testprozess unerwartet Fehler
auftun, die mehr Zeit als geplant in Anspruch nehmen und so zu Verspätungen
führen können. Zusätzlich zu unseren erfahrenen Teammitgliedern und Partnern in
allen betroffenen Feldern arbeiten wir in allen kritischen
Entwicklungsbereichen mit führenden Spezialisten zusammen, um sicherzustellen,
dass unser finales Produkt den Ansprüchen von unserer, wie auch von Kundenseite
genügt.</p>
<p><b>Sicherheit</b></p>
<p>Die bereits in den 60ern im Medizin- und Rehabereich eingesetzte
EMS-Technologie ist vielseitig auf Sicherheit getestet und wird von zahlreichen
Studien in ihrer Wirksamkeit bestätigt. Wir versichern, dass unsere Produkte
alle gängigen Qualitäts- und Sicherheitsstandards erfüllen und keinerlei
Gesundheitsrisiko für unsere Kunden darstellen werden. Weiterhin möchten wir
den Trägern der ANTELOPE-Produkte ein Höchstmaß an Komfort und Zuverlässigkeit
bieten, was immer mit der Möglichkeit einhergeht, dass sich der Zeitplan wegen
nicht eingeplanter Produktmodifizierungen verzögert.</p>
<p><b>Passform</b></p>
<p>Um eine optimale Übertragung und Leitung zwischen dem Körper des
Trägers und den Elektroden sicherzustellen, ist es unumgänglich, dass auf
Textilseite ausreichend Kompression gegeben ist. Wir versuchen, eine
bestmögliche Passform für Jedermann (und –frau) zu ermöglichen, indem wir neben
unterschiedlicher Größen auch geschlechterspezifische Schnittmuster für die
ANTELOPE Produkte anbieten. Auf diese Weise stellen wir sicher, dass unsere
Kunden den größten Trainingskomfort genießen können.</p>
<p><b>Alltagstests</b></p>
<p>Einer der bezeichnendsten Vorteile des ANTELOPE SUITS ist seine
maximale Mobilität im Gegensatz zu bisher erhältlichen EMS-Lösungen.
Dementsprechend sollte nachvollziehbar sein, dass wir keinesfalls unsere
Serienproduktion starten, bevor nicht hundertprozentige Sicherheit darüber
besteht, dass unsere Produkte in jedem Umfeld unter verschiedensten Bedingungen
einwandfrei funktionieren. Obwohl wir, was genannte Tests angeht, bereits weit
fortgeschritten und zuversichtlich sind, dass die angestrebten Ergebnisse
erreichbar sind, können Verzögerungen die angestrebte Zeitplanung beeinflussen
und zu Verspätungen im Auslieferungsprozess führen.</p>
<p><b>Zertifizierung</b></p>
<p>Die Auslieferung der ANTELOPE Series unterliegt verschiedenen
Zertifizierungsbedingungen in den unterschiedlichen zu bedienenden Märkten. Wir
haben interne Qualitätsmanagementsysteme eingerichtet, um diesbezüglich die
rechten Maßnahmen zur rechten Zeit umzusetzen. Wir erhalten in diesem Bereich
Unterstützung von Seiten eines Beratungsunternehmens, das sich auf
internationale Zertifizierungsprozesse medizinischer Gerätschaften spezialisiert
hat. Zusätzlich steht uns bei Fragen in diesem Bereich ein
DAX30-Vorstandsmitglied aus dem Bereich der medizinischen Forschung und
Entwicklung zur Seite.</p>
<p>Die Zertifizierungsprozesse für Europa, die USA und weitere
relevante Märkte sind bereits angelaufen. Nachdem wir bereits eine
FCC-Zertifizierung für Bluetoothgeräte erhalten haben, wird uns das
CE-Zertifikat voraussichtlich zum Ende des Jahres erteilt. Die
Auslieferung unserer Produkte für den Europäischen Markt ist für Februar
2016 geplant. Unterstützer unserer Kampagne mit Sitz in den USA müssen
länger auf die Auslieferung der EMS-Produkte warten.</p>
<p>Trotz der Tatsache, dass wir den gesamten Zertifizierungsprozess
sehr positiv sehen, können wir möglicherweise entstehende Verspätungen 
währenddessen nicht ausschließen.</p>
<p><b>Risiken in der
Wertschöpfungskette</b></p>
<p>Da die ANTELOPE Produkte sehr umfangreich in ihrer Herstellung
sind und aus vielen Einzelprodukten bestehen, die alle miteinander kombiniert
werden müssen, kann es vorkommen, dass Verzögerungen im Beschaffungsprozess auch
zu Verzögerungen im Auslieferungsprozess führen.</p>

<b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">FAQs</b><br/>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Wie fühlt sich
die ANTELOPE-Stimulation an – ist das nicht unangenehm?</b></p>
<p>ANTELOPE ist die Weiterentwicklung der bewährten TENS-Technologie, die
seit Jahrzehnten in der medizinischen Rehabilitation eingesetzt wird. Die
Auslösung einer Muskelkontraktion über einen elektrischen Reiz ist ein komplett
natürlicher Vorgang, der jeden Tag endlos oft von Deinem eigenen Körper genutzt
wird. Jede Bewegung die Du machst wird von einem Impuls ausgelöst, der von
Deinem Gehirn ausgeht und zu den motorischen Einheiten Deiner Muskeln läuft. So
entsteht Bewegung! ANTELOPE optimiert genau dieses natürliche Prinzip, um jede
Kontraktion und damit auch Dein Workout zu intensivieren. Praktisch gesehen
fühlt es sich ähnlich an, wie der Strahl aus einer Dusche, der aus kurzer
Entfernung auf Deinen Muskel gerichtet wird.</p>
<p><b>Für wen ist das
Training mit ANTELOPE geeignet?</b></p>
<p>Die
ANTELOPE–Produkte sind generell für jeden geeignet – egal wie alt oder
körperlich fit Du bist. ANTELOPE ist sowohl die perfekte Wahl für Personen, die
schon lange keinen Sport mehr gemacht haben und einen gelenkschonenden (Wieder-)Einstieg
suchen, für Leistungssportler, die ihr herkömmliches Training optimieren
möchten, aber auch für Menschen mit Übergewicht und überraschenderweise können
gerade auch Senioren wahnsinnig viel von ANTELOPE profitieren!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Was ist der
Vorteil am ANTELOPE-Training?</b></p>

Das
Training mit ANTELOPE führt zu einer Nutzung von über 95%  des Potentials Deiner Muskulatur durch die
Stimulation während jeder Kontraktion (anstatt der normalen ca. 70%). Das hat
zwei klare Vorteile: Für das gleiche Trainingsresultat ist deutlich weniger
Zeit notwendig und schwere Zusatzgewichte werden nicht mehr unbedingt gebraucht
- dadurch wird das Risiko verschiedenster Verletzungen minimiert. Außerdem
werden die von außen auf den Körper wirkenden Kräfte deutlich verringert,
wodurch das Training mit ANTELOPE gleichzeitig so gelenkschonend ist. Doch das
Beste kommt jetzt: ANTELOPE macht es als einziger Hersteller auf dem Markt
zusätzlich möglich diese Vorteile auch mit den gewünschten koordinativen
Mustern (z.B. Radfahren, Fußball) umzusetzen und somit die Fortschritte direkt
in sportartspezifische Leistung umzuwandeln. <br/><p>
</p>
<p><b>Wie häufig darf
ich pro Woche trainieren?</b></p>
<p>Wie oft trainiert werden darf hängt von einigen Faktoren ab. Die
wichtigsten sind die Anzahl der eingesetzten Elektroden, die Trainingserfahrung
und der Gesundheitszustand (inkl. Ernährung). </p>
<p>Grundsätzlich gilt:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Ein ANTELOPE-Training sollte aufgrund seiner hohen
Intensität nur in einem gesunden Zustand durchgeführt werden.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Anfänger sollten generell mit geringeren
Stromintensitäten beginnen und diese dann von Training zu Training steigern. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Die Regenerationszeit nach einem ausbelastenden
Krafttraining ist länger, als nach einem Ausdauertraining mit unterstützender
Stimulation.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Je mehr Muskeln stimuliert werden, desto mehr Zeit
braucht der Körper zur Erholung. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>ANTELOPE SUIT (8 Elektrodenpaare am ganzen Körper):
Nach ausbelastenden Krafttrainingseinheiten mit dem gesamten ANTELOPE SUIT
sollte in den ersten Trainingswochen mindestens eine Pause von 5 Tagen eingelegt
werden, damit der Körper genug Zeit hat, um sich komplett wiederherzustellen. Fortgeschrittenen
ANTELOPE-SUIT-Nutzern kann man eine Maximalzahl von 2-3 ausbelastenden Krafttrainingseinheiten
pro Woche empfehlen. Beim ANTELOPE-unterstützten Ausdauertraining sind die
Regenerationszeiten nur halb so lang bzw. können doppelt so viele Einheiten pro
Woche durchgeführt werden.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN’S DREAM oder WING (jeweils zwei Elektrodenpaaren): aufgrund der
verringerten Gesamtelektrodenzahl die während dem Training eingesetzt wird,
können entsprechend mehr Einheiten pro Woche durchgeführt werden. </p>

Wenn
der Körper nach dem Training nicht genügend Zeit bekommt, um seine Strukturen
wiederherzustellen, kommt es auch zu keiner positiven Anpassung an das
Training. Aus diesem Grund sind Pausen extrem wichtig und sollten besonders am
Anfang auch eingehalten werden.<p>
</p>
<p><b>Was ist der
Unterschied zwischen ANTELOPE und den Stimulations-Bauchgürteln aus der Fernsehwerbung?</b></p>

Der
Hauptunterschied ist: statische, lokale und isolierte vs. Aktive, mobile und
breite (Ganzkörper)-Stimulation. Mit der Hilfe der ANTELOPE-Produkte kannst Du
mit einer deutlich höheren Gesamtintensität und in Deiner Sportart trainieren. Sowohl
die kleinen Stimulationsgeräte (TENS) mit Klebeelektroden, als auch Stimulationsgürteln,
ermöglichen lediglich ein passives Training weniger ausgesuchter Muskelpartien.
Der positive und der negative Pol liegen bei diesen Geräten meist auf einem
Muskel, wodurch die wenigen stimulierten Muskeln nur isoliert angesprochen
werden. Ein funktionelles Training ist mit diesen Geräten nicht möglich und ein
Transfer auf sportartspezifische Bewegungen nahezu ausgeschlossen. Bei den
ANTELOPE-Produkten sind die positiven und negativen Elektroden nicht auf einem
Muskel platziert, sondern stimulieren von einer zur anderen Körperhälfte.
Dadurch wird nicht nur die Fläche direkt unterhalb der Elektroden stimuliert,
sondern gleichzeitig auch die entsprechenden Gegenspieler (Antagonisten) und
Stabilisatoren (Synergisten) der angesprochenen Muskulatur. Zusätzlich werden
die darunterliegenden Nerven großflächig stimuliert, wodurch weitere
Muskelgruppen aktiviert werden. Und besonders dank der vollständigen Mobilität
der ANTELOPE-Produkte, können die Effekte bereits direkt innerhalb der
richtigen Bewegungsmuster erreicht werden, wodurch die sportartspezifischen
Fähigkeiten direkt verbessert werden.<br/><p>
</p>
<p><b>Was sind die
Kontraindikationen des ANTELOPE-Trainings?</b></p>
<p>Bevor
das Training mit den ANTELOPE Produkten beginnt, solltest Du einen Arzt
aufsuchen und sicherstellen, dass Du „sportgesund“ und bereit für ein hartes
Training bist. </p>
<p>Wenn
einer der folgenden Punkte auf Dich zutrifft, darfst Du die ANTELOPE-Produkte leider
aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht verwenden:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Herzschrittmacher oder andere elektrische
Implantate</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Schwangerschaft</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>ernsthafte neurologische, kardiovaskuläre oder
Tumor-Erkrankungen</p>

Wie
bei anderen Sportarten auch solltet Ihr zudem mit akuten Krankheiten (Fieber,
akute Entzündungsprozesse oder/und akute bakterielle/virale Infektionen, etc.)
auf sportliche Belastungen verzichten und Euch zuerst vollständig erholen.<br/><p>
</p>
<p><b>Wie kann ich mit ANTELOPE trainieren? Gibt es eine
App?</b></p>
<p>Wir haben sehr lange an unserer App gearbeitet und bieten unseren
Nutzern mit der ANTELOPE APP eine individuelle Betreuung an. Die App hilft bei
der Einstellung der optimalen Trainingsintensitäten, passt diese im Verlauf der
Trainingseinheiten automatisch individuell an, steigert die Trainingsintensität
gemäß neuster wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse und bietet eine Vielzahl an
sportartspezifischen Einsatzmöglichkeiten. Der Nutzer kann sich außerdem auf
Trainingspläne, Erklärungen, Videos, GPS-Aufzeichnungen und eine Social-Media-Schnittstelle
freuen. Als besonderes Feature werden für jede durchgeführte Aktivität Punkte
vergeben, durch die ein individuelles Fertigkeiten-Profil des Nutzers erstellt
wird. Über die Gesamtpunktzahl ist es so möglich in verschiedene Level aufzusteigen
und so seinen Trainingserfolg dokumentieren zu können. Außerdem verfügt die App
über einen Trainingskalender, in dem alle Trainings gespeichert und
nachträglich eingesehen werden können. Wir sind zudem immer dran weitere
Features zu entwickeln und werden unsere App damit immer wieder auf einen
neueren Stand bringen.</p>
<p><b>Wie kann es sein, dass man EMS jetzt
auch während dem Laufen oder Radfahren einsetzen kann?</b></p>

Bis ANTELOPE entwickelt wurde, waren EMS-Geräte teuer und nur stationär
einsetzbar. Deswegen wurde EMS hauptsächlich in darauf spezialisierten Fitnessstudios
eingesetzt. Dadurch, dass das ANTELOPE-System völlig mobil ist und über eine
App gesteuert wird, ist jetzt auch der Einsatz im Freien möglich. Dafür gibt es
spezielle submaximale Stimulationsprogramme und Trainingsempfehlungen, um die
Koordination der Tret- oder Laufbewegung durch die Stimulation nicht negativ zu
beeinflussen. Der Effekt wird dabei hauptsächlich durch die Voraktivierung der
gesamten Muskulatur und die positive Wirkung auf das Gefäßsystem erreicht.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wie sieht es mit der Passform und den Größen der Bekleidung
aus?</b><br/></p>
<p>Die Textilen sind
für Frauen und Männer jeweils in vier verschiedenen Größen verfügbar (Frauen: XS, S, M, L/Männer S, M, L, XL).
Durch das stark ausgeprägte und an den Körper optimierte Kompressionsmaterial
liegen alle ANTELOPE-Produkte sehr eng an und gewährleisten somit ein
angenehmes Tragegefühl und eine korrekte Stimulation.</p>

</p>
<p>Todos los productos ANTELOPE están hechos de una tela de
compresión elástica multidireccional que aseguran que los electrodos estén
constantemente bien situados. Estos electrodos de nueva generación se conectan
en la parte interior del traje mediante unos cables conductores especiales. El
ANTELOPE BOOSTER hace contraer los músculos y los controla a través de una
aplicación via Bluetooth. Esta <i>app</i> sirve para evaluar los datos que
recibe y contiene programas y herramientas especialmente desarrollados para
controlar una serie de ajustes (niveles de frecuencia e intensidad, duración
del entrenamiento, velocidad, intervalos, etc). Una vez recabados los datos,
estos se guardan en la aplicación y se puede acceder a ellos con total
comodidad. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444599739/sxce08fdski9hzwpzire.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>El mayor atractivo del BOOSTER es el gran número de grupos
musculares que se puede activar con él. Para activar un grupo muscular
(ambos bíceps o ambos cuádriceps, por ejemplo), se necesita un par
de electrodos con un polo positivo y otro negativo para que la corriente
parta de un electrodo, penetre  en el cuerpo y salga por otro
electrodo. Un dispositivo que activa solo un grupo muscular se
llama “dispositivo de un solo canal” pero cuantos más grupos musculares se
necesitan activar, más canales serán necesarios.</p>
<p>Nosotros ofrecemos dos BOOSTERS diferentes. La diferencia entre
ellos estriba en el número máximo de grupos musculares que pueden activar,
la complejidad tecnológica y, como consecuencia de estas dos, el precio.
Para nuestros productos suplementarios como los CALF GUARDS, el TANK
TOP, el WOMEN’S DREAM y el WING, usamos un BOOSTER de dos canales, llamado
“BOOSTER 2c”, dado que estos productos activan como mucho dos grupos. Para
nuestro ANTELOPE SUIT, usamos uno de ocho canales, el “BOOSTER 8c”, que
estimula todo el cuerpo con electrodos situados en brazos, pecho, vientre,

Se ha probado científicamente que esta tecnología para el entrenamiento
aumenta el rendimiento deportivo de quien lo usa. Pero ANTELOPE ha llevado un
paso más allá a la electroestimulación muscular (EMS): ANTELOPE respeta la
manera en la que el cuerpo funciona, imita con precisión los procesos que
ocurren en nuestro cuerpo cuando el cerebro dirige la contracción muscular, lo
que hace que el movimiento sea completamente natural. La diferencia radica en
que la EMS estimula directamente el músculo, por lo que activa un porcentaje
mucho más elevado de fibras. Este es el secreto de la efectividad de los
productos ANTELOPE.<br/></p>

</div></div>","ANTELOPE is the result of our tremendous passion for sports combined with German high-tech know-how. Our product range includes different products that help you get the most out of your workout in any situation. All our products consist of special compression fabrics with integrated electrodes and wiring thus it feels just like your usual sports clothing. The electrical impulses are triggered by the electronic unit called ANTELOPE BOOSTER. The system can be comfortably steered with your smartphone or tablet through our ANTELOPE APP. 
The textiles will be available in 4 different sizes for each sex.




A training with ANTELOPE is highly effective. For example, in 4
weeks you can increase: performance up to 30%, jumping
ability up to 20%, muscle volume up to 10%. 














We
created ANTELOPE for everyone – no matter what is your sex, age or physical
condition status. Integrate it into your everyday life the way you like. Whether
outdoors, at the gym or at home there are no spatial boundaries. 
Ambitious
athletes can use it as ultimate performance enhancing tool. Highly busy
professionals, lacking time for their routine workout, and individuals, looking
for a perfect tool to stay in shape in the most time efficient manner, can use
it as an all-in-one mobile gym solution completing the full-body workout
session in just 20 minutes. 
Enhance
strength, endurance, coordination and speed. Combine endurance training and
power training. Increase your strength, explosive strength or maximum speed
directly during the training sessions in your favorite sport disciplines. 





Examples: triathletes can train their core muscles while running or
cycling. Football players can increase their shot power, volleyball and
basketball players their jumping ability. Tennis and baseball players can
improve their striking power, while golf players can improve their swing on the
driving range. Passionate power athletes can apply highly intensive muscle contractions
making workout with weights or classical equipment obsolete or supplementary. ANTELOPE
puts no strain on the joints.










All ANTELOPE products are made of  multi-directional stretching compression fabrics, which insure that the integrated electrodes are constantly placed on the skin in the right position. These newest generation electrodes, which do not need any external electrolytes, are connected with special conductive cables on the inner side. The ANTELOPE BOOSTER activates the muscle contraction and is controlled by an app via Bluetooth. The app is the adjustment  and evaluation tool. It contains specially developed programs and settings (frequency, intensity levels, trainings length, speed, intervals, etc). Training data is saved and can easily be accessed. 

The primary feature of the BOOSTER is the number of muscle groups it can activate. To activate one muscle group (e.g. both biceps or both upper leg muscles) a pair of electrodes with positive and negative poles is required so that the current can flow out from one electrode, enter into the body and then leave at other electrode to complete the path. A device that activates only one muscle group is called 1-Channel device. The higher the number of the muscle groups that need to be activated the higher the number of channels the device needs to have. 
We are offering two different BOOSTERS, which differ in terms of the maximum number of muscles groups they can activate, technological complexity and consequential pricing points. For our supplementary products i.e. CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN'S DREAM and WING we use a 2-channel BOOSTER (“BOOSTER 2c”) as these products maximally activate two muscle groups. For our ANTELOPE SUIT we will use the 8-Channel solution (“BOOSTER 8c”) to stimulate whole body with electrodes placed on the arms, chest, belly, back, bottom, upper legs. 






ANTELOPE has  further developed Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). This training technology has been scientifically proven to enhance sports performance. ANTELOPE  respects  the way your body works. It precisely mimics the processes that occur in our body when our brain directs muscles to contract. So its absolutely natural. But in case of EMS the stimulus occurs directly on the muscle and activates a much higher percentage of the fibers. Thats the secret why our ANTELOPE products are so effective.










Our
ANTELOPE Series won two ISPO Brandnew Awards 2015 (sportswear & public
choice) at the largest and most prominent sports fair worldwide. We have also attained
the PLUS X Award – the world’s largest innovation award for technology, sports
and lifestyle. This October we were voted as the Audience Winner at Camp
Beckenbauer, an independent platform for global decision makers from the world
of sports.

All perks include a webinar introduction into the application of the ANTELOPE products. 








All prototypes of our revolutionary sportswear have been developed by our in-house engineering team. Together with our strong network of cooperation partners, such as experts in electrodes, wiring and textile production, we have found the best solution for the ANTELOPE series. Apart from textiles and hardware we have also developed and continuously improved our ANTELOPE app, to provide you the best assistance for your workout with ANTELOPE. You will have the option to control the intensity of muscle stimulation and evaluate your training history and improvements in results and vital date through the dedicated dashboard. Furthermore, we are working on integration of personal workout sessions with virtual coaches as well as customised workout plan with activity reminder function. We want to create a community, where you can interact with personal trainers and other athletes start competitions, share current/up to date information, the newest workouts or diets.


We were founded in March 2014. We are an interdisciplinary team and cover all the crucial business fields in-house. Our management brings long-term experience in the respective field of responsibility and has broad international background. Furthermore we are supported by a very experienced and dedicated advisory board, which shares our passion for the ANTELOPE Series.








Risks
and challenges of the ANTELOPE project
Technology and day-to-day testing
The
ANTELOPE Suit is a truly innovative breakthrough product combining different
areas of expertise such as textiles and electronics engineering, wiring,
software development and sport science. We want to give people, who are as
fascinated about EMS workout as we are, technically the best possible equipment
in terms of quality, design and feeling. We want you to use our products in different environments outside, at home, etc. To ensure that our products work in every applicable environment we are conducting rigorous testing in different conditions. 
We have allowed time for the tests in our plans. Nonetheless, we do face risk that the
prototype tests being constantly carried out in-house reveal bugs or
suboptimal workflow of software or hardware resulting in required adjustments
and thus leading to delay in deliveries. Even though we are confident that our
team’s wide-ranging expertise in all relevant fields is extensive to address
all the challenges, we have established partnerships with leading specialist in
all critical areas of product development. Such set-up makes us confident that
we can handle risks associated with software and hardware development.
Safety
EMS
is a proven and hazard-free technology, which is widely supported by many
studies. It originates from the medical rehabilitation field and was initially
developed in the 60-ies. We will make sure our products comply with the highest
quality and safety standards and are completely safe to use. We will provide
the maximum comfort and reliability to our customers, however unforeseeable
improvements might result in some time delay.
Fitting
The
fitting of the textiles for every body type can be challenging as for perfect
conduction you need sufficient compression to ensure ultimate interaction of
the electrodes and the skin. We will offer a variety of sizes for both sexes to
secure the perfect fit of your ANTELOPE product. We also recognise the
importance of the comfort you, as our dedicated customer, require during your
workout. We are confident of finding the best possible solution in terms of
sizing and comfort for you.
Certification
The delivery of the ANTELOPE series products is subject to certain certifications in the respective markets. We have installed internal quality management system that supports the timely implementation of the appropriate procedures. We are not only familiar with the respective requirements but are also supported by a dedicated consulting company specialising in international certification procedures for medical appliances and a member of the board of a DAX30 company in the field of medical R&D.
The certification process for Europe, US and other relevant markets has started. We have obtained FCC certificate for Bluetooth communication and will complete CE Certification by the end of the year. The delivery of the products in Europe is planned to start February 2016. International shipments will take place after the appropriate clearance from the relevant government bodies has been received, e.g. early backers from the US who support us will only be able to receive an EMS-based perk only after we receive 510(k) clearance from FDA. 
Even though we are confident that we are well prepared to handle the respective processes, we cannot eliminate the risk of delays due to compliance issues.


Supply
Chain Risks
ANTELOPE products are complex and
involve many parts. While we have dedicated team members covering sourcing and
supply chain, delays may occur if we face longer than expected lead times in
delivery of parts.
FAQs
Electrical stimulation sounds dangerous – but does is hurt!
ANTELOPE is an evolution of a proven technology called
TENS, which has been used for rehabilitation purposes for decades. Elicitation
of muscle contraction using electrical impulses is absolutely natural as such
elicitation precisely mimics the processes that occur in our body when our
brain directs muscles to contract. Every movement you accomplish in your
day-to-day life is triggered by a small electrical impulse generated by your
brain resulting in activation of the motor units of your muscles. That’s how
movements are generated! ANTELOPE has optimized this natural principle by placing
the electrodes directly on the muscles and thus intensifying every contraction
and your whole workout. Imagine taking a shower and directing the showerhead
with strong water beam from a short distance on your muscle – that’s how it
feels.
What are the benefits of the training with ANTELOPE?
The ANTELOPE products are generally made for everyone – no
matter how old or physically fit you are. ANTELOPE is the perfect choice for
(i) those who haven’t been physically active for a long time and who are
looking for a joint-friendly restart, (ii) athletes who want to optimize their
conventional training,  (iii) people with weight problems and (iv) elderly
looking to improve their overall condition.
What are the advantages of training with ANTELOPE?
Thanks to additional stimulation during each muscle contraction
the workout with ANTELOPE activates more than 95% of the muscle potential (vs.
70% during conventional workout). This has two major advantages: (i) for
identical training result less time is required and (ii) heavy weights are no
longer needed – there is no strain on the joints and, thus, the risk of various
injuries is minimized. In addition, the impact of external forces on the body
is reduced. ANTELOPE is the only tool on the market that can be incorporated
into any sports to specifically improve desired coordination patterns (e.g.
cycling, football or basketball) and thus directly enhance performance.
How often can I exercise with Antelope per week?
The number of training sessions per week depends on several
factors. The most important factors are the state of your health (incl. diet),
previous workout experience with EMS devices, what kind of workout you are
primarily doing and what type of the ANTELOPE product you are using.  
In general:
-  You should use ANTELOPE during your training routine
only in a healthy state due to the workout’s high intensity.
-  Beginners should generally start with lower current
intensities and increase them from session to session.
-  Time required for the body to regenerate is longer after
an exhaustive power training session (high current intensities) than after an
endurance specific training (lower supporting current intensities).
-  The more muscles you stimulate, the longer they need to
recover.
-  ANTELOPE SUIT (8 stimulated muscle groups on the whole
body): After exhaustive strength training sessions with the entire ANTELOPE
SUIT you should rest for at least 4 days within the first weeks of training so
that your body has enough time to recover fully. For advanced ANTELOPE SUIT
users maximum number of 2 - 3 exhaustive strength training sessions per week
can be recommended. Applying ANTELOPE during endurance training sessions
results in regeneration times being only half as long, i.e. twice the number of
sessions per week can be accomplished. In general, the number of sessions is
subject to the overall intensity of the workout.
-  CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN'S DREAM or WING (one or two stimulated muscle groups): Due to
reduced number of electrodes used during the workout more sessions can be
conducted per week accordingly.
Please note that when the body does not get enough time for its
muscle structures to recover the effect of the workout will be insignificant.
Therefore, breaks between workouts are extremely important and should be
adhered to especially at the beginning.
What’s the difference between ANTELOPE and the ab belts from TV
commercials?
The main difference is: ANTELOPE offers active, mobile and broad
(full body) stimulation vs. static, local and isolated stimulation. You can not
only integrate ANTELOPE into your favorite sports but also exercise with a
higher overall intensity.
Small devices (TENS) with adhesive electrodes and ab stimulating
belts are not suited for active training. Moreover just a limited number of
muscles can be stimulated. The positive and negative poles of these devices are
usually placed on only one muscle resulting in isolated stimulation of a small
amount of muscle fibers.
The placement of the electrodes in ANTELOPE products is
different. Positive and negative electrodes are not located on the same muscle
but on the opposite sides of the body, thus, not only stimulating the area
directly below the electrodes, but also the opponents (antagonists) and
stabilizers (synergists) at the same time. In addition, such approach activates
the underlying nerves, leading to stimulation of additional muscle groups. The
mobility feature of the ANTELOPE products allows to effectively improve
movement patterns of an athlete the sport specific abilities.
What are the contraindications of the ANTELOPE training?
Unless you are in good physical condition to go through a tough
workout please consult a doctor prior to training with the ANTELOPE products .
If one of the following health conditions is applicable to you,
you are unfortunately not allowed to use ANTELOPE products for safety reasons:
-  pacemaker or other electrical implants,
-  pregnancy,
-  severe neurological or cardiovascular diseases or any
types of cancer
Please note that you should abstain from physical exercising during
acute illness (fever, acute inflammatory processes or/and acute bacterial/viral
infections etc.) and recover completely first.
How do I use ANTELOPE and how do I steer it?
Our ANTELOPE app is the ultimate steering tool. We’ve been
working on it for a while to provide our users with individual support. The app
helps you to set the optimal training intensities, adapts them individually and
automatically with increasing training experience, increases/decreases the
training intensity based on the latest scientific findings and offers a huge
variety of sport specific use cases. We will be offering guided workouts,
videos, explanations, GPS tracking and a social media interface. To make it
easier for you to track your performance you will be awarded certain points
after every completed exercise. By continuously accumulating points you will be
able to track your workout success and adjust it according to your personal
goals. Your personal profile will include a training calendar, in which every
training session will be saved and can be viewed retroactively. We are
continuously working on new features to provide you more interaction and
variety for your workout.
How is it possible to use EMS during conventional sports like
running or biking?
To date all full-body EMS devices can be applied only
stationary. Such devices are also extremely expensive with pricing points above
USD 10,000. For this reason EMS is currently mainly used in specialized gyms.
ANTELOPE system is fully mobile, thus, removes the spatial boundaries and
brings EMS outdoors. We have developed special submaximal stimulation programs
for each specific sporting activity with training suggestions to avoid negative
influence on coordination during your exercise e.g. during cycling or running.
Pre-activation of all muscles and the positive effect of the electrical impulse
on the vascular system are the major drivers of the positive results for
endurance sports.
What about the correct fit and the sizes of the garment?
The textiles are available for each
sex in 4 different sizes (S, M, L, XL for men and XS, S, M, L for women).
The specially developed compressive garment of the ANTELOPE products fits very
tight and ensures a comfortable fit and proper positioning of the electrodes.
It offers multi-directional stretching that allows the textile to conform to
every curve of your body and move with you. The fabric is breathable,
antibacterial and machine washable.









Alle Produkte bestehen aus einem extrem dehnfähigem Kompressionsgewebe, in das modernste Elektroden sowie strapazierfähige
Leiterbahnen integriert sind. ANTELOPE fühlt  sich ganz normal an und
 lässt sich auch bequem unter jeder Sportbekleidung tragen. Zu allen
Textilien gehört der ANTELOPE BOOSTER, über diesen werden die elektrischen
Impulse ausgelöst. Gesteuert wir das System per App über Smartphone oder
Tablet. Die Textilien sind für Frauen und Männer jeweils in vier verschiedenen
Größen erhältlich.
Training mit ANTELOPE ist
höchst effektiv. In vier Wochen ist es möglich, bis zu 30% Leistung zu verbessern sowie 20% Sprungkraft
und 10% Muskelvolumens zu erhöhen. 







ANTELOPE bietet eine Vielzahl an
Trainingsmöglichkeiten. Beispielsweise können mit ANTELOPE Kraft,
Ausdauerfähigkeit, Koordination oder Schnellkraft verbessert
werden. ANTELOPE lässt sich in jede Sportart integrieren und ist mobil
einsetzbar: egal ob Draußen, im Fitnessstudio, auf Reisen oder Zuhause –
der Trainingsort spielt keine Rolle mehr. Alle Produkte der ANTELOPE
Series sind auch ideal einsetzbar zur Regeneration nach Wettkämpfen oder in der
Rehabilitation bei Verletzungen.
ANTELOPE ist nicht nur für leidenschaftliche Sportler entwickelt worden. Auch Anfänger oder gar Sportmuffel können sich mit dieser revolutionären Sportbekleidung in Form bringen – unabhängig von Alter, Geschlecht oder dem individuellen Fitnesszustand. Zudem lässt sich ANTELOPE auch in den Alltag integrieren. Einfach unter der normalen Kleidung getragen, können im Büro oder Zuhause mit der Massage-Einstellung zum Beispiel Verspannungen gelöst oder vorgebeugt werden.










Unsere Textilien bestehen alle aus einem speziellen
Kompressionsgewebe, in das modernste Elektroden integriert sind. Aufgrund der
extremen Dehnfähigkeit des Stoffes passt sich die Textilie dem Körper perfekt
an. Durch den Kompressionseffekt der Kleidung wird sichergestellt, dass die
Elektroden, die ohne externe Elektrolyte auskommen, auf der Haut nicht
verrutschen. Auf der Innenseite eingearbeitete Stromkabel passen sich zudem der
Elastizität des Stoffes an. Die elektrischen Impulse werden von einer
smartphonegroßen Elektronikeinheit – dem ANTELOPE BOOSTER – ausgelöst.
Reguliert wird dieser per App über Smartphone oder Tablet. Die App beinhaltet
verschiedene Trainingsprogramme und Einstellungen  unter anderem für
Frequenz, Intensität und Trainingsdauer.



Der ANTELOPE BOOSTER versetzt den Nutzer in die Lage, mehrere
Muskelgruppen zeitgleich zu stimulieren. Um eine Muskelgruppe zu aktivieren,
wird ein Elektrodenpaar, bestehend aus positivem und negativem Pol, benötigt.
Elektrischer Strom fließt zwischen den Polen durch die Muskulatur – ein
Kreislauf entsteht. Geräte zur Aktivierung einer einzigen Muskelgruppe werden
als Ein-Kanal-Geräte bezeichnet. Je höher die Anzahl der zu aktivierenden
Muskelgruppen, desto höher die Anzahl der nötigen Kanäle.
Wir bieten zwei Versionen des BOOSTERs an, die sich in der
Anzahl gleichzeitig aktivierbarer Muskelgruppen und folglich in der technischen
Komplexität sowie im Preis unterscheiden. Unsere Zusatzprodukte, wie CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN’S DREAM und WING, laufen mit dem 2-Kanal-BOOSTER
(„BOOSTER 2c“) und können maximal zwei Muskelgruppen gleichzeitig aktivieren.
Für den ANTELOPE SUIT hingegen bauen wir auf die 8-Kanal-Elektronik („BOOSTER
8c“), um Arme, Brust, Bauch, Rücken, Gesäß und Oberschenkel (Beinbizeps und
Quadrizeps) gleichzeitig zu stimulieren. 








Die ANTELOPE Series ist eine Weiterentwicklung der
EMS-Technologie. Bei dieser hocheffektiven und zeitsparenden Trainingsmethode
wird die natürliche Muskelkontraktion durch elektrische Impulse unterstützt.
Sowohl bei ANTELOPE als auch bei EMS wird durch einen externen Reiz eine Kontraktion
ausgelöst. Dabei können die Muskeln keinen Unterschied zwischen einer
willkürlichen Kontraktion (ausgelöst durch das Gehirn) und einer elektrisch
induzierten Kontraktion feststellen: die geleistete Arbeit ist genau die
gleiche – ganz natürlich, nur viel effektiver. 





ANTELOPE wurde bereits mehrfach ausgezeichnet: unter anderem sind wir zweifacher ISPO Award Gewinner 2015 in den Kategorien Sportswear und Public Choice sowie Träger des PLUS X Award Gütesiegels. Außerdem wurden wir diesen Oktober von den Teilnehmern des Camp Beckenbauer zum Audience Winner gekürt. Bereits im September siegten wir bei dem Startup-Event Startups@Reeperbahn. 

Alle  Belohnungen beinhalten eine Onlineeinführung der ANTELOPE Series. 









Alle Prototypen der revolutionären ANTELOPE Series wurden von
unserem internen Expertenteam entwickelt. In Kooperation mit einem starken
Netzwerk aus Partnern und Beratern aus den Bereichen Elektrotechnik, Verkabelung und Textilingenieurwesen haben wir die unserer Meinung nach beste
Lösung zur Fertigung der ANTELOPE Series gefunden. Neben der Entwicklung von
Textil und Hardware haben wir auch die ANTELOPE App entworfen, getestet und von
Version zu Version verbessert, um Nutzer so gut und detailliert wie möglich
beim Training zu unterstützen. Die App ermöglicht die Kontrolle der
Trainingsintensität und Einsicht in den eigenen Trainingsverlauf. Zusätzlich
bietet der Kontrollbildschirm die Option, sich über Erfolge und Vitaldaten zu
informieren und diese zu bewerten. Wir arbeiten bereits daran, in einer
zukünftigen Version der ANTELOPE App personalisierte Trainingsprogramme mit
virtuellen Trainern und Trainingsplänen zu integrieren. Wir möchten eine
Community gründen, die die Interaktion mit Personal Trainern und den Wettkampf
der Athleten untereinander fördert. Hier soll man sich über aktuelle
Trainingserfolge, -methoden oder Ernährungspläne austauschen können.




Wir wurden im März 2014 gegründet. Aktuell besteht unser
interdisziplinäres Team aus 14 Mitgliedern, bestehend aus Serial Entrepreneurs,
 EMS-Pionieren, Textil- und Elektroingenieuren, Modedesignern, Software- und IT-Spezialisten,
Sportwissenschaftlern, Vertriebs-, Marketing- und PR-Experten sowie einem
Professor der Neurophysiologie. Viele mit einem internationalen Background.
Unterstützt wird unser Team von einem von einem erfahrenen und namenhaften
Beirat.




 



Risiken und Herausforderungen
des Projekts
Technologie
Als bahnbrechendstes Innovationsprodukt unserer Zeit kombiniert
ANTELOPE die Bereiche Textil- und Elektrotechnik mit Leiterlegung und
Verkabelung, Softwareentwicklung und Sportwissenschaft. Unser Ziel ist es,
sport- und besonders EMS-begeisterten Menschen das Bestmögliche in Sachen
Qualität, Design und Feeling zu bieten. Trotz all unserer Bemühungen besteht
immer die Möglichkeit, dass sich im internen Testprozess unerwartet Fehler
auftun, die mehr Zeit als geplant in Anspruch nehmen und so zu Verspätungen
führen können. Zusätzlich zu unseren erfahrenen Teammitgliedern und Partnern in
allen betroffenen Feldern arbeiten wir in allen kritischen
Entwicklungsbereichen mit führenden Spezialisten zusammen, um sicherzustellen,
dass unser finales Produkt den Ansprüchen von unserer, wie auch von Kundenseite
genügt.
Sicherheit
Die bereits in den 60ern im Medizin- und Rehabereich eingesetzte
EMS-Technologie ist vielseitig auf Sicherheit getestet und wird von zahlreichen
Studien in ihrer Wirksamkeit bestätigt. Wir versichern, dass unsere Produkte
alle gängigen Qualitäts- und Sicherheitsstandards erfüllen und keinerlei
Gesundheitsrisiko für unsere Kunden darstellen werden. Weiterhin möchten wir
den Trägern der ANTELOPE-Produkte ein Höchstmaß an Komfort und Zuverlässigkeit
bieten, was immer mit der Möglichkeit einhergeht, dass sich der Zeitplan wegen
nicht eingeplanter Produktmodifizierungen verzögert.
Passform
Um eine optimale Übertragung und Leitung zwischen dem Körper des
Trägers und den Elektroden sicherzustellen, ist es unumgänglich, dass auf
Textilseite ausreichend Kompression gegeben ist. Wir versuchen, eine
bestmögliche Passform für Jedermann (und –frau) zu ermöglichen, indem wir neben
unterschiedlicher Größen auch geschlechterspezifische Schnittmuster für die
ANTELOPE Produkte anbieten. Auf diese Weise stellen wir sicher, dass unsere
Kunden den größten Trainingskomfort genießen können.
Alltagstests
Einer der bezeichnendsten Vorteile des ANTELOPE SUITS ist seine
maximale Mobilität im Gegensatz zu bisher erhältlichen EMS-Lösungen.
Dementsprechend sollte nachvollziehbar sein, dass wir keinesfalls unsere
Serienproduktion starten, bevor nicht hundertprozentige Sicherheit darüber
besteht, dass unsere Produkte in jedem Umfeld unter verschiedensten Bedingungen
einwandfrei funktionieren. Obwohl wir, was genannte Tests angeht, bereits weit
fortgeschritten und zuversichtlich sind, dass die angestrebten Ergebnisse
erreichbar sind, können Verzögerungen die angestrebte Zeitplanung beeinflussen
und zu Verspätungen im Auslieferungsprozess führen.
Zertifizierung
Die Auslieferung der ANTELOPE Series unterliegt verschiedenen
Zertifizierungsbedingungen in den unterschiedlichen zu bedienenden Märkten. Wir
haben interne Qualitätsmanagementsysteme eingerichtet, um diesbezüglich die
rechten Maßnahmen zur rechten Zeit umzusetzen. Wir erhalten in diesem Bereich
Unterstützung von Seiten eines Beratungsunternehmens, das sich auf
internationale Zertifizierungsprozesse medizinischer Gerätschaften spezialisiert
hat. Zusätzlich steht uns bei Fragen in diesem Bereich ein
DAX30-Vorstandsmitglied aus dem Bereich der medizinischen Forschung und
Entwicklung zur Seite.
Die Zertifizierungsprozesse für Europa, die USA und weitere
relevante Märkte sind bereits angelaufen. Nachdem wir bereits eine
FCC-Zertifizierung für Bluetoothgeräte erhalten haben, wird uns das
CE-Zertifikat voraussichtlich zum Ende des Jahres erteilt. Die
Auslieferung unserer Produkte für den Europäischen Markt ist für Februar
2016 geplant. Unterstützer unserer Kampagne mit Sitz in den USA müssen
länger auf die Auslieferung der EMS-Produkte warten.
Trotz der Tatsache, dass wir den gesamten Zertifizierungsprozess
sehr positiv sehen, können wir möglicherweise entstehende Verspätungen 
währenddessen nicht ausschließen.
Risiken in der
Wertschöpfungskette
Da die ANTELOPE Produkte sehr umfangreich in ihrer Herstellung
sind und aus vielen Einzelprodukten bestehen, die alle miteinander kombiniert
werden müssen, kann es vorkommen, dass Verzögerungen im Beschaffungsprozess auch
zu Verzögerungen im Auslieferungsprozess führen.


FAQs



Wie fühlt sich
die ANTELOPE-Stimulation an – ist das nicht unangenehm?
ANTELOPE ist die Weiterentwicklung der bewährten TENS-Technologie, die
seit Jahrzehnten in der medizinischen Rehabilitation eingesetzt wird. Die
Auslösung einer Muskelkontraktion über einen elektrischen Reiz ist ein komplett
natürlicher Vorgang, der jeden Tag endlos oft von Deinem eigenen Körper genutzt
wird. Jede Bewegung die Du machst wird von einem Impuls ausgelöst, der von
Deinem Gehirn ausgeht und zu den motorischen Einheiten Deiner Muskeln läuft. So
entsteht Bewegung! ANTELOPE optimiert genau dieses natürliche Prinzip, um jede
Kontraktion und damit auch Dein Workout zu intensivieren. Praktisch gesehen
fühlt es sich ähnlich an, wie der Strahl aus einer Dusche, der aus kurzer
Entfernung auf Deinen Muskel gerichtet wird.
Für wen ist das
Training mit ANTELOPE geeignet?
Die
ANTELOPE–Produkte sind generell für jeden geeignet – egal wie alt oder
körperlich fit Du bist. ANTELOPE ist sowohl die perfekte Wahl für Personen, die
schon lange keinen Sport mehr gemacht haben und einen gelenkschonenden (Wieder-)Einstieg
suchen, für Leistungssportler, die ihr herkömmliches Training optimieren
möchten, aber auch für Menschen mit Übergewicht und überraschenderweise können
gerade auch Senioren wahnsinnig viel von ANTELOPE profitieren!


Was ist der
Vorteil am ANTELOPE-Training?

Das
Training mit ANTELOPE führt zu einer Nutzung von über 95%  des Potentials Deiner Muskulatur durch die
Stimulation während jeder Kontraktion (anstatt der normalen ca. 70%). Das hat
zwei klare Vorteile: Für das gleiche Trainingsresultat ist deutlich weniger
Zeit notwendig und schwere Zusatzgewichte werden nicht mehr unbedingt gebraucht
- dadurch wird das Risiko verschiedenster Verletzungen minimiert. Außerdem
werden die von außen auf den Körper wirkenden Kräfte deutlich verringert,
wodurch das Training mit ANTELOPE gleichzeitig so gelenkschonend ist. Doch das
Beste kommt jetzt: ANTELOPE macht es als einziger Hersteller auf dem Markt
zusätzlich möglich diese Vorteile auch mit den gewünschten koordinativen
Mustern (z.B. Radfahren, Fußball) umzusetzen und somit die Fortschritte direkt
in sportartspezifische Leistung umzuwandeln. 

Wie häufig darf
ich pro Woche trainieren?
Wie oft trainiert werden darf hängt von einigen Faktoren ab. Die
wichtigsten sind die Anzahl der eingesetzten Elektroden, die Trainingserfahrung
und der Gesundheitszustand (inkl. Ernährung). 
Grundsätzlich gilt:
- 
Ein ANTELOPE-Training sollte aufgrund seiner hohen
Intensität nur in einem gesunden Zustand durchgeführt werden.
- 
Anfänger sollten generell mit geringeren
Stromintensitäten beginnen und diese dann von Training zu Training steigern. 
- 
Die Regenerationszeit nach einem ausbelastenden
Krafttraining ist länger, als nach einem Ausdauertraining mit unterstützender
Stimulation.
- 
Je mehr Muskeln stimuliert werden, desto mehr Zeit
braucht der Körper zur Erholung. 
- 
ANTELOPE SUIT (8 Elektrodenpaare am ganzen Körper):
Nach ausbelastenden Krafttrainingseinheiten mit dem gesamten ANTELOPE SUIT
sollte in den ersten Trainingswochen mindestens eine Pause von 5 Tagen eingelegt
werden, damit der Körper genug Zeit hat, um sich komplett wiederherzustellen. Fortgeschrittenen
ANTELOPE-SUIT-Nutzern kann man eine Maximalzahl von 2-3 ausbelastenden Krafttrainingseinheiten
pro Woche empfehlen. Beim ANTELOPE-unterstützten Ausdauertraining sind die
Regenerationszeiten nur halb so lang bzw. können doppelt so viele Einheiten pro
Woche durchgeführt werden.
- 
CALF GUARDS, TANK TOP, WOMEN’S DREAM oder WING (jeweils zwei Elektrodenpaaren): aufgrund der
verringerten Gesamtelektrodenzahl die während dem Training eingesetzt wird,
können entsprechend mehr Einheiten pro Woche durchgeführt werden. 

Wenn
der Körper nach dem Training nicht genügend Zeit bekommt, um seine Strukturen
wiederherzustellen, kommt es auch zu keiner positiven Anpassung an das
Training. Aus diesem Grund sind Pausen extrem wichtig und sollten besonders am
Anfang auch eingehalten werden.

Was ist der
Unterschied zwischen ANTELOPE und den Stimulations-Bauchgürteln aus der Fernsehwerbung?

Der
Hauptunterschied ist: statische, lokale und isolierte vs. Aktive, mobile und
breite (Ganzkörper)-Stimulation. Mit der Hilfe der ANTELOPE-Produkte kannst Du
mit einer deutlich höheren Gesamtintensität und in Deiner Sportart trainieren. Sowohl
die kleinen Stimulationsgeräte (TENS) mit Klebeelektroden, als auch Stimulationsgürteln,
ermöglichen lediglich ein passives Training weniger ausgesuchter Muskelpartien.
Der positive und der negative Pol liegen bei diesen Geräten meist auf einem
Muskel, wodurch die wenigen stimulierten Muskeln nur isoliert angesprochen
werden. Ein funktionelles Training ist mit diesen Geräten nicht möglich und ein
Transfer auf sportartspezifische Bewegungen nahezu ausgeschlossen. Bei den
ANTELOPE-Produkten sind die positiven und negativen Elektroden nicht auf einem
Muskel platziert, sondern stimulieren von einer zur anderen Körperhälfte.
Dadurch wird nicht nur die Fläche direkt unterhalb der Elektroden stimuliert,
sondern gleichzeitig auch die entsprechenden Gegenspieler (Antagonisten) und
Stabilisatoren (Synergisten) der angesprochenen Muskulatur. Zusätzlich werden
die darunterliegenden Nerven großflächig stimuliert, wodurch weitere
Muskelgruppen aktiviert werden. Und besonders dank der vollständigen Mobilität
der ANTELOPE-Produkte, können die Effekte bereits direkt innerhalb der
richtigen Bewegungsmuster erreicht werden, wodurch die sportartspezifischen
Fähigkeiten direkt verbessert werden.

Was sind die
Kontraindikationen des ANTELOPE-Trainings?
Bevor
das Training mit den ANTELOPE Produkten beginnt, solltest Du einen Arzt
aufsuchen und sicherstellen, dass Du „sportgesund“ und bereit für ein hartes
Training bist. 
Wenn
einer der folgenden Punkte auf Dich zutrifft, darfst Du die ANTELOPE-Produkte leider
aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht verwenden:
- 
Herzschrittmacher oder andere elektrische
Implantate
- 
Schwangerschaft
- 
ernsthafte neurologische, kardiovaskuläre oder
Tumor-Erkrankungen

Wie
bei anderen Sportarten auch solltet Ihr zudem mit akuten Krankheiten (Fieber,
akute Entzündungsprozesse oder/und akute bakterielle/virale Infektionen, etc.)
auf sportliche Belastungen verzichten und Euch zuerst vollständig erholen.

Wie kann ich mit ANTELOPE trainieren? Gibt es eine
App?
Wir haben sehr lange an unserer App gearbeitet und bieten unseren
Nutzern mit der ANTELOPE APP eine individuelle Betreuung an. Die App hilft bei
der Einstellung der optimalen Trainingsintensitäten, passt diese im Verlauf der
Trainingseinheiten automatisch individuell an, steigert die Trainingsintensität
gemäß neuster wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse und bietet eine Vielzahl an
sportartspezifischen Einsatzmöglichkeiten. Der Nutzer kann sich außerdem auf
Trainingspläne, Erklärungen, Videos, GPS-Aufzeichnungen und eine Social-Media-Schnittstelle
freuen. Als besonderes Feature werden für jede durchgeführte Aktivität Punkte
vergeben, durch die ein individuelles Fertigkeiten-Profil des Nutzers erstellt
wird. Über die Gesamtpunktzahl ist es so möglich in verschiedene Level aufzusteigen
und so seinen Trainingserfolg dokumentieren zu können. Außerdem verfügt die App
über einen Trainingskalender, in dem alle Trainings gespeichert und
nachträglich eingesehen werden können. Wir sind zudem immer dran weitere
Features zu entwickeln und werden unsere App damit immer wieder auf einen
neueren Stand bringen.
Wie kann es sein, dass man EMS jetzt
auch während dem Laufen oder Radfahren einsetzen kann?

Bis ANTELOPE entwickelt wurde, waren EMS-Geräte teuer und nur stationär
einsetzbar. Deswegen wurde EMS hauptsächlich in darauf spezialisierten Fitnessstudios
eingesetzt. Dadurch, dass das ANTELOPE-System völlig mobil ist und über eine
App gesteuert wird, ist jetzt auch der Einsatz im Freien möglich. Dafür gibt es
spezielle submaximale Stimulationsprogramme und Trainingsempfehlungen, um die
Koordination der Tret- oder Laufbewegung durch die Stimulation nicht negativ zu
beeinflussen. Der Effekt wird dabei hauptsächlich durch die Voraktivierung der
gesamten Muskulatur und die positive Wirkung auf das Gefäßsystem erreicht.

Wie sieht es mit der Passform und den Größen der Bekleidung
aus?
Die Textilen sind
für Frauen und Männer jeweils in vier verschiedenen Größen verfügbar (Frauen: XS, S, M, L/Männer S, M, L, XL).
Durch das stark ausgeprägte und an den Körper optimierte Kompressionsmaterial
liegen alle ANTELOPE-Produkte sehr eng an und gewährleisten somit ein
angenehmes Tragegefühl und eine korrekte Stimulation.







Todos nuestros productos tienen unos tejidos especiales de
compresión con electrodos integrados diseñados de tal manera que ni los
notarás, ¡creerás que llevas puesta tu ropa deportiva de toda la vida! Un
dispositivo electrónico llamado ANTELOPE BOOSTER provoca los impulsos
eléctricos y el sistema intercambia datos entre el traje y un Smartphone o
tableta mediante nuestra ANTELOPE APP. Todos los productos estarán disponibles
en cuatro tallas diferentes para cada sexo.


ANTELOPE es muy eficaz. En cuatro semanas de entrenamiento puedes
mejorar hasta 30% de tú rendimiento, 20% de tu capacidad de salto, 10% de tu volumen muscular. 






Mejorar el rendimiento en disciplinas basadas en la resistencia
como correr o ir en bicicleta. Entrenar la fuerza máxima, la fuerza explosiva o
la velocidad máxima en los entrenamientos de tus disciplinas deportivas
favoritas. Recuperar activamente después de un esfuerzo o incluso masajearte
alguna parte específica del cuerpo. Y aun hay más: podrás utilizar nuestros
productos al aire libre, en el gimnasio o en casa.










Todos los productos ANTELOPE están hechos de una tela de
compresión elástica multidireccional que aseguran que los electrodos estén
constantemente bien situados. Estos electrodos de nueva generación se conectan
en la parte interior del traje mediante unos cables conductores especiales. El
ANTELOPE BOOSTER hace contraer los músculos y los controla a través de una
aplicación via Bluetooth. Esta app sirve para evaluar los datos que
recibe y contiene programas y herramientas especialmente desarrollados para
controlar una serie de ajustes (niveles de frecuencia e intensidad, duración
del entrenamiento, velocidad, intervalos, etc). Una vez recabados los datos,
estos se guardan en la aplicación y se puede acceder a ellos con total
comodidad. 



El mayor atractivo del BOOSTER es el gran número de grupos
musculares que se puede activar con él. Para activar un grupo muscular
(ambos bíceps o ambos cuádriceps, por ejemplo), se necesita un par
de electrodos con un polo positivo y otro negativo para que la corriente
parta de un electrodo, penetre  en el cuerpo y salga por otro
electrodo. Un dispositivo que activa solo un grupo muscular se
llama “dispositivo de un solo canal” pero cuantos más grupos musculares se
necesitan activar, más canales serán necesarios.
Nosotros ofrecemos dos BOOSTERS diferentes. La diferencia entre
ellos estriba en el número máximo de grupos musculares que pueden activar,
la complejidad tecnológica y, como consecuencia de estas dos, el precio.
Para nuestros productos suplementarios como los CALF GUARDS, el TANK
TOP, el WOMEN’S DREAM y el WING, usamos un BOOSTER de dos canales, llamado
“BOOSTER 2c”, dado que estos productos activan como mucho dos grupos. Para
nuestro ANTELOPE SUIT, usamos uno de ocho canales, el “BOOSTER 8c”, que
estimula todo el cuerpo con electrodos situados en brazos, pecho, vientre,
espalda, glúteos y muslos.





Se ha probado científicamente que esta tecnología para el entrenamiento
aumenta el rendimiento deportivo de quien lo usa. Pero ANTELOPE ha llevado un
paso más allá a la electroestimulación muscular (EMS): ANTELOPE respeta la
manera en la que el cuerpo funciona, imita con precisión los procesos que
ocurren en nuestro cuerpo cuando el cerebro dirige la contracción muscular, lo
que hace que el movimiento sea completamente natural. La diferencia radica en
que la EMS estimula directamente el músculo, por lo que activa un porcentaje
mucho más elevado de fibras. Este es el secreto de la efectividad de los
productos ANTELOPE.

periods of time. Its variable resistance also makes the Wringo360™ excellent
for people who struggle with weight and health issues that render classical
exercise difficult. Because it works the body’s kinetic chain from head to toe
and everywhere in between, the Wringo360™ also benefits those who exercise
regularly, including athletes, by strengthening coordination and the
independent interaction of muscles, ligaments, tendons, bones and joints. Its patented <b><i>Rotational Friction Resistance</i> (RFR) technology</b> is clinically

Wringo 360 is simple to use, its light weight makes it perfect to pack and go, if I want to take it to the office, or on a trip. I highly recommend this product to anyone, at any fitness level, particularly if you have any difficulty using regular weights and machines at a gym or have injuries.""Sandy J. | Tarzana, CA


""We are currently researching the relationship between Mind/Body---Body/Mind through NeuroFeedback brain mapping, and we are evaluating movement efficacy allowing three-dimensional tailored feedback. When exercise is more fluid and effortless, blood flow efficiency in the brain is improved considerably, contributing to increased exercise effectiveness. This type of research will greatly impact and significantly benefit human beings on multiple levels.""Ron F | San Francisco, CA""The first time I used the Wringo360 I was really surprised by how fluid and smooth it was. I thought there was no way this small, lightweight; single piece of equipment was going to give me a workout or cause me to work up a sweat, let alone increase my heart rate. Boy oh boy was I wrong. The best thing about it is that I could determine exactly what muscle group I wanted to target in a fun way. I could focus on my biceps till I felt the burn, then instantly switch to my triceps, without having to adjust a pin, or move to another machine. All right there, on the spot! It's the perfect training tool for anyone on the go since it's light and compact. I think everyone should have one of these, especially for toning. I can't think of a better way to give your muscles a good stretch and strengthening. Perfect for athletes who don't want to pull anything. You can easily achieve a full body workout in less than 15 minutes with this thing. This is a truly revolutionary fitness product. Not a gimmick. Love my Wringo!""

</h3> <p>We (Randy &amp; Kate Crafton) moved to Siloam Springs almost three years
 ago and began training friends and strangers in our garage. Since then,
 God led us to open a gym in Siloam Springs that encourages wellness and
 overall fitness. Our members have been able to come off medications, 
use their strength to help in crisis situations and live better lives. 
Three weeks ago we had the opportunity to put an offer in on a building 
downtown that will be the future location for Red Beard Fitness, Cross 
Country Cyclery and a small market for local, healthy foods. But now we 
need your help! Our vision for our complex is to have a central meeting 
place where people can experience diverse areas of fitness and encourage
 each other.  If we can come up with $24,000 in 30 days we'll be able to
 help our 
neighborhood, surrounding areas and our own children with learning how 
to live a healthier
 lifestyle. This is an uphill battle when our local obesity rate is 39% 
and our diabetes rate is nearly THREE TIMES the national average! We 
need our community to get involved! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The breakdown of what we want to provide:</h3>
<ul> <ul>
<li>100% of your donations will go toward the down payment and 
renovation of our health complex, making it ADA accessible so we can 
help more people!</li>
<li>If our Indiegogo campaign ($24,000) is fully funded Red Beard 
Fitness will be able to 
sponsor two families, every 6 months, and provide them with nutrition 
counseling and gym access three times a week...giving them the tools 
they need to create a better lifestyle for them and their children in 
the future at no cost! According to Bridges To Wellness, one of the 
biggest problems that we face in the area is people being 
able to afford health centers and gyms. We currently sponsor individuals
 that otherwise couldn't pay for a gym membership and will be able to do
 it on a
 larger scale with a new facility. Do you know of someone who is trying 
to change their life but can't because of finances?  Email us at 
redbeardfit@gmail.com.</li>

</h3>  If you live in Siloam or surrounding areas you know that our poverty and
 obesity rates are extremely high. Arkansas was named the 9th most obese
 state in 2011 and moved up to 4th most obese in 2015. Community Clinic reported 70% of patients have 
chronic illnesses including obesity, hypertension, congestive heart 
failure and diabetes. We want help residents make better food choices 
and get out and get moving in all different ways! This isn't just a gym 
that thinks that their way is the ONLY way to stay fit. We want anyone, 
including non-members, to be able to walk in the door and be connected 
with any type of fitness that they're interested in. Weight lifting, 
walking, running, biking, kayaking, yoga, dance, jiu jitsu and more! We 
can give you the names and information of people in the community that 
are interested in the same sports and activities! <br/>Until 3 years ago 
neither of us had interest in being a healthy example for our children. 
Then we found an area of fitness that we fell in love with and through 
that we discovered how to help others. It takes daily support and 
teaching someone the tools of clean living to truly change habits that 
you've had for life. Our facility also has plans to become a meeting 
place for Bridges to Wellness, to hold healthy lifestyle programs for 
residents.<br/><ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>But it has to happen NOW!<br/>
</h3>We have a VERY short time to raise funds for this beautiful, historic 
building in downtown Siloam Springs. It's all or nothing! Without your 
help we won't be able to buy and renovate the building, which has 
potential to grow and expand to change even more lives! In less than a 
year our membership started with 3 people and has grown to over 70 
members. Those members are encouraging their friends, family, coworkers 
and even strangers to make changes that lead to lower healthcare costs 
and better quality of living. The more people that we reach the better 
we can make this community with that domino effect! Take a minute to 
watch our videos so you can hear some of the stories that have come out 
of just a few months of teaching people to value health and wellness. 
When our facility brings more people to Main Street it will also 
increase revenue for our small businesses in the downtown area!

<div>Recently my son was diagnosed with OCD, Sensory Processing Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder. He didn't have any of these issues when he was small, he had no signs of being on the spectrum. I believe that our children are being affected by our environment, what they eat, and what we put on their bodies. </div>
<div>My commitment to bringing safe and truly chemical free skin and body care to the world is almost an obsession. I think it's a healthy obsession. We need to keep ourselves and our children safe. I look at it this way... If you start with one bottle of cleanser or jar of face cream, you are bound to start thinking about what else you use that has chemicals and if you are going to use one organic product than why not branch out and keep that ball rolling. We all have to start somewhere and what the earth needs is for us to go back to ORGANIC. No more GMO's, pesticides, insecticides, synthetics, or dyes. our children don't need these things in their bodies and our planet doesn't need it in the soil. </div>
<div>My passion is in the earth... dirty hands make me happy. I started Fawn and Willow because I was tired of reading labels on ""Organic"" and ""Natural"" skin care that listed off cancer causing, hormone disrupting, and allergy causing ingredients (just to name a few) and were deemed natural. The FDA does NOT regulate the skin care and body care industry and it's ingredients.  If it's an ""approved"" chemical for market or food, companies can dump whatever they want into your products. By now it's a well published fact that we absorb up to 60% of what we leave on our skin all day. Words like Organic and Natural have been used in one marketing ploy after another, in the end meaning nothing. A product may hold actual organic ingredients but once you add DMDM Hydantoin and urea, propylene glycol, parabens, and phthalates, it doesn't matter if those ingredients are organic because these chemical negate their positive effects.</div>
<div>I started growing my own Organic herbs and making my own tinctures and serums. And you know what? They work. They work 10 times better than anything I have ever spent hundreds of dollars on in a department store. I always had this dream of returning to the old ways, to really trusting flowers and herbs to do what they were created to do. It's beautiful. I have been studying botany, biology, and herbal medicine since I was a teen wandering through the woods in Massachusetts. </div>
<div>When we can we purchase local like beeswax from local PA apiaries and organic honey when we are in Maine. Our packaging even comes from a company here in PA, just an hour away in Lancaster so we can pick it up and reduce our footprint on shipping.</div>
<div>But we can't do this without your help...</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Funding... </h3>
<div>Your contribution will go directly to the build Baby Fawn and Mama Doe line. Sourcing high end organic ingredients with chemical preservatives is expensive and I never wanted to go to investors. I believe that investors can have affect on the original goal and while I'm still building and fulfilling the dream I would rather depend on YOU.</div>

<p>Your Contribution Helps the Planet...</p>

Not only are we passionate about our product and how it's made... we are even more passionate about our Earth and reversing the effects of Global Warming and Climate Change so that our future generations can spend their days outside in the sun. </p>
<p>We also actively plant bee and monarch friendly plants and flowers because there is a severe shortage of these very important pollinating insects. Saving the bees is crucial to all of us, not just farmers but the world in general. 1/3 of our food supply comes from pollinators!

Did you know that the Environmental Working Group did a test on umbilical cords of newborn babies and found an average of 232 chemicals? Some of these chemicals included BPA, a plastic component and synthetic estrogen. They are chemicals found in a wide array of common household products -- a list that is as long as it is familiar -- shampoos and conditioners, cosmetics.

<h3>Why we're doing this<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>Having two little girls of our own made us realize how important it is that all people,  especially kids, have healthy meals during the day, and we strive to make that easier for families in the Chattanooga area.</b> And it goes beyond a good meal — we believe that all of this contributes to a healthier world and better planet too.
<b><br/></b></p>
<p>We don’t have rich parents or inheritances to back us up, and we don’t want to rely on fancy investors that will take half the ownership of our business away from us. <br/></p>
<p>We have always been <b>DIY</b>, and using Indiegogo allows lower income families like ours to start a business — something formerly out of reach for a large segment of Americans. We moved up to the mountains and started Sassafras Farms to provide healthy food for our local community, and to provide a gathering space for people working creatively to make a more just and equitable world. <br/></p>
<p>Through Laughing Sprouts and our network, we aim to provide affordable healthy lunches while also building an alternative
 business community. We believe it’s a pretty radical thing and we’d 
love for you to be a part of this journey with us.<br/></p>
<p>Here's a couple pics of what we had going on this summer:</p>

</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges <br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p> <i>We need startup capital</i>. But that's why we're here on Indiegogo asking you to join our friends and family with helping us get the funds to launch this baby. Kicking off the Indiegogo campaign now (and succeeding!) means that we'll be able to make Laughing Sprouts a reality with the start of 2016.<br/></p>
<p> <i>First
time in this business</i>.  Even
though Sumner has owned his own business and Michelle has
experience in a similar field as Laughing Sprouts, neither has
directly participated in the school lunch delivery business. But we've spent hundreds of hours on research and development of our business plan, outreach strategy, and we're prepared to hit the ground running once we launch.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<i>Building traction. </i>Every startup has to think about getting enough customers quickly  enough to be immediately profitable. We're planning on starting small, and building slowly if necessary. Our combined years of experience starting and running previous businesses gives us the insights and the know-how to leverage local business/personal relationships. Also, our business model is based on numerous successful companies all across America. <b>We are very fortunate to be the first company doing this in Chattanooga's market and that will give us a tremendous leg up.
</b><ul> </ul> </div><div>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
<i>How will we get access to so much locally-grown food? </i><br/>Sumner has been ordering from local farmers for over three years for the <a href=""https://chattanoogamobilemarket.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chattanooga Mobile Market</a>
 — a not-for-profit bringing healthy foods to food deserts which lack 
grocery stores and fresh produce. There is more than enough food grown 
locally to support Laughing Sprouts as we grow. <br/></p>
<p>
<i>How can such high-quality lunches be this cheap? </i><br/>Easy. The larger quantity of food you order the cheaper it becomes — and one of our long term goals is to use organic food that we grow right at Sassafras Farms.  And our network of local 
farmers have fair, comparable pricing that will help keep our lunches 
affordable for working class families. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Will there be a good variety of dishes? </i><br/>Yep,
 we already figured this out, testing recipes over the last 3 years. We 
have dozens upon dozens of healthy alternatives to traditional foods. See the sample menu items above, and feel free to write us with any questions. <br/></p>

We make healthy lunches and deliver them. $5 a pop.
Our mission: To provide a high quality, healthy, affordable, 
socially responsible lunches to daycare children and staff, 
schoolchildren, teachers and administrators in the greater Chattanooga 
area.

We're going to be the first lunch delivery service in town. We’ll also be sourcing organic and locally-grown sustainable ingredients from farms and community-supported agriculture. Good for the planet, good for the body.

Sample menu items

We've tested a mountain of recipes and figured out how to make them as 
healthy as possible with veggies and fiber added in ways that you'd never suspect. But we don't need to tell the kids that.  ;)




Mac & Cheese MuffinsMacaroni and cheese is one of the easiest foods to add healthy ingredients to without sacrificing taste. Our muffins have egg, sweet potato and carrots tucked inside.
Enlightened Enchiladas
We use low-fat cheese, low-fat 
turkey/beef, and veggies like zucchini, spinach and cauliflower cut so 
small you'll never notice that they're snuck in.
Spaghetti & Meatballs 100% grass fed and organic beef with tiny undetectable spinach, broccoli, green peas and wheat germ.

Grass-fed Burger100% grass-fed and organic beef, prepared low-fat with locally grown veggies on top. 


We even have a healthy Brownie recipe that has half the sugar and fat of box brownies, and is tricked out with pureed spinach, blueberries, oat bran and wheat germ hidden in it — it tastes amazing and the kids are none the wiser!
We have tons of recipes and will include other lunchtime classics like butternut squash soup, turkey wraps, veggie sushi, chicken tenders, healthy pizza, caesar salad, quesadillas, taco salad, mozzarella pesto sandwich, and lots of healthy sides like fruit kebabs, veggies, berries, banana bread, applesauce, etc.

 and the Small Business Association who went over our business plan with
 us. We received high praises for our work, and most importantly they 
believe this will be a successful business in Chattanooga!  

Here's our budget breakdown:






 

Who we are


We’re a small working-class family with big hearts, big dreams, and a lot of experience in the food industry and community-based service programs. 



Celebrated 10 wonderful years of marriage this October :)

Michelle has 10+ years of experience in the food service industry. 

• Managed Bagelicious Cafe & Bagel Shop in St. Augustine FL
• Created farm-to-table menus at Nolichucky Bluffs Bed & Breakfast, TN
• Worked as a server at numerous fine dining establishments

Sumner has successfully started, run, and managed businesses and community programs before:
• Earned a B.A. in Business at Flagler College
• Managed a fitness center in Ames, IA
• Co-founder and manager of Loose Screws gift shop, rare video, and music venue in St. Augustine FL from 2003-2007. Held numerous film screenings, speaking engagements, workshops, and 
provided free meeting space to various community groups in St. Johns County. (5 
years)
As a part of Loose Screws' commitment to the community, Sumner also spearheaded the following projects:• Co-founder of Loose Sprockets. This group collected used, old or trashed bicycles, fixed them up and gave them to migrant farm worker families. In the first year, over 100 bikes were given out for free. All bikes, parts and labor was donated. (2 years)• Helped with local Food Not Bombs chapter, providing a free meal 7 nights a week, serving primarily the homeless population of St. Augustine FL. Received donations from local restaurants and had a waiting list of church groups and volunteers who wanted a night to serve. (7 years)• Gathered clothes, blankets, bug spray and toiletries for homeless residents four times per year. (5 years)• Co-founder of the local awareness group “People United to Stop Homelessness” (PUSH). Raised awareness on homelessness in county and eased tension between police, business community, residents and homeless population. Presented at Florida Coastal School of Law on homeless issues.• Bicycle Advocacy: Convinced all county commissioners to commit that any time a county road was redone or built, bike lanes would be included in the plans.• Co-founder and operator of the local independent newspaper “The Collective Press”. It was the only not-for-profit, citizen-run newspaper in St. Augustine FL. (4 years)• Big Brother of St. Johns County mentorship volunteer (2 years)• Helped construct a community garden on a neglected property in a low income community in St. Augustine FL.• Sumner currently works with the Chattanooga Mobile Market, bringing fresh and healthy food to the city's food deserts and low-income neighborhoods where fresh fruits and veggies are hard to come by. 




Why we're doing this

Having two little girls of our own made us realize how important it is that all people,  especially kids, have healthy meals during the day, and we strive to make that easier for families in the Chattanooga area. And it goes beyond a good meal — we believe that all of this contributes to a healthier world and better planet too.

We don’t have rich parents or inheritances to back us up, and we don’t want to rely on fancy investors that will take half the ownership of our business away from us. 
We have always been DIY, and using Indiegogo allows lower income families like ours to start a business — something formerly out of reach for a large segment of Americans. We moved up to the mountains and started Sassafras Farms to provide healthy food for our local community, and to provide a gathering space for people working creatively to make a more just and equitable world. 
Through Laughing Sprouts and our network, we aim to provide affordable healthy lunches while also building an alternative
 business community. We believe it’s a pretty radical thing and we’d 
love for you to be a part of this journey with us.
Here's a couple pics of what we had going on this summer:





    Risks & Challenges 


 We need startup capital. But that's why we're here on Indiegogo asking you to join our friends and family with helping us get the funds to launch this baby. Kicking off the Indiegogo campaign now (and succeeding!) means that we'll be able to make Laughing Sprouts a reality with the start of 2016.
 First
time in this business.  Even
though Sumner has owned his own business and Michelle has
experience in a similar field as Laughing Sprouts, neither has
directly participated in the school lunch delivery business. But we've spent hundreds of hours on research and development of our business plan, outreach strategy, and we're prepared to hit the ground running once we launch.

Building traction. Every startup has to think about getting enough customers quickly  enough to be immediately profitable. We're planning on starting small, and building slowly if necessary. Our combined years of experience starting and running previous businesses gives us the insights and the know-how to leverage local business/personal relationships. Also, our business model is based on numerous successful companies all across America. We are very fortunate to be the first company doing this in Chattanooga's market and that will give us a tremendous leg up.
  


FAQs


How will we get access to so much locally-grown food? Sumner has been ordering from local farmers for over three years for the Chattanooga Mobile Market
 — a not-for-profit bringing healthy foods to food deserts which lack 
grocery stores and fresh produce. There is more than enough food grown 
locally to support Laughing Sprouts as we grow. 

How can such high-quality lunches be this cheap? Easy. The larger quantity of food you order the cheaper it becomes — and one of our long term goals is to use organic food that we grow right at Sassafras Farms.  And our network of local 
farmers have fair, comparable pricing that will help keep our lunches 
affordable for working class families. 


Will there be a good variety of dishes? Yep,
 we already figured this out, testing recipes over the last 3 years. We 
have dozens upon dozens of healthy alternatives to traditional foods. See the sample menu items above, and feel free to write us with any questions. 
...and since you made it this far, so here's a laugh to get things going :)Video Outtakes

Let QTemp Help YouWhether you're monitoring the UV index for medical reasons, or spend a lot of time outdoors, QTemp sends alerts to help you keep on top of your skin health. It helps you protect your loved ones, too.Don’t be fooled - the UV index doesn’t depend on temperature. QTemp helps you protect yourself in both hot and cold locations. It also makes a great travel companion or gift!  Why You Need QTemp 
Stay aware of harmful UV rays
1 in 5 Americans, 1 in 7 Canadians and 2 in 3 Australians are developing skin cancer in their lives, mostly because of overexposure to the sun. Overexposure to the sun is the leading cause of skin cancer. It’s time to stop risking our health, and start protecting ourselves and our loved ones. Allow QTemp to help you live a healthier and more comfortable lifestyle.

 

UVA radiation accelerates aging while UVB radiation causes sunburns. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, car windows let in over 60% of UVA radiation. 50% of UVA radiation can pass through windows. 80% of UV radiation can penetrate thin clouds, so you can still experience overexposure on overcast days.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>At Happy Ears, the parent company of Happy Jr, we love sounds and we want kids to be exposed to sounds. Sounds are critical for a child’s learning, discovery and development. The sound of a bee in the garden, screams from a rollercoaster or that first concert with mom or dad; sounds are wonderful. Sound though is not necessarily noise. There is a difference between sounds and noise and even noise pollution. A child may scream or cry if a siren goes off in their vicinity, but not even notice “noise”. Noise and noise pollution though is a growing problem in modern society and more needs to be done to protect kids from its harm. It is now well documented that repeated exposure to even moderate noise levels are harmful to a child’s health. Once an adult, hearing loss leads to increased risk of heart disease. Often underappreciated are the long-term effects on mental health. </p>
<p>Strangely, consumers spend to purchase organic foods to protect their children from chemicals and pesticides and they spend to protect their children’s skin and eyes from the sun yet nothing to protect their ears? Happy Ears discovered when you create a discreet, comfortable, reusable earplug that can be used during sleep, travel or to attend a concert, adults do choose to protect their ears.</p>
<p>Happy Ears created Happy Jr. to offer kids the same ability to protect their hearing and health. Another high quality product from Happy Ears that was designed in Sweden and will be “Made in Sweden”; Happy Jr. is the hearing protection device parents will want their kids to wear. It will turn down the volume in your child’s life and dare we say it’s even stylish.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Happy JR will be produced at the same ISO Certified factory in Stockholm, Sweden where we have successfully produced Happy Ears since 2012. For over two years we’ve worked on the development and theory behind our new innovation and recently we filed our patent. Thus in theory we’re all set with the world’s best hearing protection for kids and teenagers. In detail that means: <br/>1) Even attenuation = so your kids can hear their class mates, teachers and enjoy events (music, sports) just like we as parents do with high quality ear plugs in noisy environments.  <br/>2) Light and comfortable to use. <br/>3) Look smashing.</p>
<p>Although we’re done in theory the risk and challenges of a new production line is always present as the first batch is going to be rolled out. We have both internal as well as external risks. </p>
<p><strong>Internal risks</strong> <br/>We’ve learned a lot from our previous project launches over the last decade, and (this time), engaged top Swedish engineers, patent lawyers, product developing experts etc already from the start in order to minimize all potential obstacles. We’re a solid team. <br/>Nonetheless, there are risks and challenges to get any physical item right in production and in regards to Happy JR the ones that still exists at this point are the following ones; </p>
<p>#1: we don't know how exactly how even the attenuation is going to be. With Happy Ears we managed to get the best attenuation in the market. For Happy JR we have a pretty good hunch that it will be good, but if we hit the bulls eye again is up to the gods.</p>
<p>#2: We know for a fact that it is going to be light. Very light. About four times lighter compared to what’s out in the market for kids today and thereby much more comfortable to wear. </p>
<p>What we don't know though is exactly how comfortable they will feel when finally produced. We have 3D SLA models and various clay and rubber castings which has been tested on all our kids, our kids friends and their friends friends to get the perfect fit. (But these 3D SLA models are not that comfortable. Obviously.) </p>
<p>#3: Hey, here we evaluate the risk to approximately 50% that we are going to design an ugly and corny hearing protection like all others have been doing for the 30 years. We are not really that worried about this part, although you never know in product development what surprises will pop up (production, material, or a combination of these).</p>
<p><strong>External risks </strong><br/>We have created a solid production plan for all you backers and done our very best to forecast demand for this campaign. Nonetheless, sometimes our forecasts aren’t always right on the spot but if we would miss our projections this time we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Risk </strong><br/>As already mentioned the manufacturing will take place at the factory in Stockholm which has over 30 years experience and with whom we’ve build a steady relation to over the past 5 years. However, unexpected shortages can occur and component delays may occur so we must take that into account. If it happens, we’ll keep you updated along the progress and do everything in our power to solve the problem as quickly as possible.</p>

We are not really that worried about this part, although you never know in product development what surprises will pop up (production, material, or a combination of these).
External risks We have created a solid production plan for all you backers and done our very best to forecast demand for this campaign. Nonetheless, sometimes our forecasts aren’t always right on the spot but if we would miss our projections this time we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible. 
Supply Chain Risk As already mentioned the manufacturing will take place at the factory in Stockholm which has over 30 years experience and with whom we’ve build a steady relation to over the past 5 years. However, unexpected shortages can occur and component delays may occur so we must take that into account. If it happens, we’ll keep you updated along the progress and do everything in our power to solve the problem as quickly as possible.

Allbaro’s innovative air cell technology provides personalized spinal support to align, strengthen, and correct your posture.    Allbaro Air is the world’s first and only posture corrector that uses a patented ergonomically-designed air pressure cell to fit your unique body. The air cell technology allows you to adjust the air pressure and create the most comfortable back support while effectively realigning your balance.  While the air cells offer comfort and effortlessly realign and balance your posture, they provides  incredibly firm spinal support with a powerful resistance strength of up to 300 pounds.  Allbaro’s innovative air cells are super easy to use. Simply twist the included hand air pump to the air valve and start pumping. To release the air, simply press the button on the air valve.   Allbaro Air exhibited at CES 2020 and received amazing responses! Thank you so much for visiting us. As promised, we offer Allbaro Air at 50% OFF retail price here on Kickstarter as our Launch Day Special.    Most posture correctors in the market simply focus on reminding you how slouching you are or holding only your shoulders backward, which often creates distractions with non-stop alerts and pain without much help to correct the posture.   However, proper posture is a habit. It requires practice and consistency. Allbaro Air is designed to fit your body, NOT to fight your body, so that you can wear it comfortably anywhere any time.  Simply adjust the length of the band that goes over your shoulder and to the waist to create the best fit for your body.  By pumping the air into the air cell, you can also adjust the air pressure to get the best support for your back.  The success of posture correction products depends on consistent use. Consistency depends on comfort. Allbaro Air is designed to provide a real and lasting solution for your health and comfort.  Dr. Kim says, ‘an increasing number of people regularly complain about back pain across all age groups. Our waists bear heavy weight with constant movement, increasing the chances of back injuries. The back is a sensitive, complex system of bones, discs, nerves, muscles, and ligaments forming and surrounding the spine.’He also adds, ‘Our posture determines whether we experience back pain or develop spinal cord diseases. It is critical to correct bad posture as soon as possible. Correct posture alone can guarantee a healthy back.’    Allbaro Air is the only posture corrector that provides personalized spinal support with its patented air cell technology.  The air cells are developed based on the medical device standard of 300 KPa with the maximum internal air pressure resistance.   Inflating and deflating the patented air cells takes minimal effort. The specially-designed hand pump fits easily onto the air valve. You can easily release the air with a simple press of the button on the valve.  The ergonomically-designed air cells softly wrap around the back and waist to gently correct bad posture.  The breathable mesh fabric prevents overheating and sweating through the day. The mesh is durable and protected fabric, and does not inconveniently attach to Velcro straps.   Allbaro Air offers wide shoulder bands in order to prevent pain under armpits while wearing it. It is also made of high-quality neoprene fabric for durability.   Excellent durability by double fabric sewing provides long-lasting comfort and fit even with extended use.   Allbaro Air is tested safe from toxic substances such as arylamine, pH and formaldehyde.       Posture is not only about how you look. Posture determines how you feel and how others feel about you. Wear Allbaro Air and hold yourself high. Meet the attractive and powerful you.  Proper posture is a habit. A continuing choice. It requires practice and consistency. Allbaro Air, as comfortable as air, lightweight and breathable, is the posture corrector that you can wear every day. Start today!               PLEASE NOTE: 1. You can choose your sizes for Double, Family, and Business Rewards after the campaign. We will be sending out surveys to collect your shipping information along with your selection of sizes after the campaign successfully ends. 2. Duties and taxes may apply in some countries. We will make sure to safely deliver Allbaro Air at your door, and we'd like to kindly ask our backers to take care of duties and taxes if applied. If you have any questions, please contact us at hello@allbaroair.com.              We are thrilled to introduce our new product, Allbaro Air, through Kickstarter and cannot wait to meet with Kickstarter backers.

<p> I started my yoga journey a couple years ago after a back injury left me unable to work for several months. I had always been a fan of fitness, but after my injury I needed to find a gentle, restorative workout that would help me rebuild my strength as well as provide therapy for my injury. I began entering yoga challenges and pushing myself to give at least an hour a day to my practice. It became so much more than just poses and pictures, it became a way of life. I woke every day excited to warm up on the mat, excited to find another challenge and post a photo. I found a community full of fun loving, beautiful souls who shared the same passion I do. I also realized there was a demand for it in my area but there weren't many options for classes or teachers. I had friends ask me to teach them and I love to yoga with anyone, but I feel having my license and learning how to properly align them is very important. If you help me achieve my goal of obtaining my RYT you'll be bringing yoga to a community that really needs it. Even one hour of yoga every few days could help relieve so much pain and stress.</p>
<p>Any money from this fundraiser will go toward the books I need for the course, my RYT and my tent space at the school I will be learning from. This also includes any props or gear I may need for the course.</p>
<p>If the fundraiser does not meet its goal I will still be saving every penny and adding to it with every extra dime I have until the goal is reached. I have until June to raise this money and save my space at the school. I appreciate all of your help. Even a few shares goes a long way if you can't donate please please  share. Thank you so much for your valued time!</p>

<p>Yellow Birds' Fort Robinson Outbreak Spiritual Run was founded by Phillip Whiteman Jr. originally, to pay homage to those Northern Cheyenne
ancestors that broke out of Fort Robinson on January 9, 1879. Most of them were
killed at this time, but a few survived and made it to their homeland, the
Powder River country in Southeastern Montana. Because of the sacrifice of Chief Dull Knifes band, and the determination of Chief Little Wolfs people, they
now have the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Today the 19th Annual Fort Robinson Run has grown to be much more: It is about <strong>healing</strong>, <strong>wellness,</strong> and <strong>empowerment</strong>.</p>
<p>The runners include over 100 Northern Cheyenne youth from the
reservation who range in age from 10 to young adults. We bring  youth from all backgrounds together . Many of the participants
are considered “at risk” youth and come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and some come from strong families, they come together to mentor one another. The
runners make a commitment to undertake a five day journey across 400 miles that
commemorates their ancestry by replicating their epic journey from Nebraska to
their homeland in Montana. They run day and night enduring January temperatures
and physical hardships, much like their ancestors of 136 years ago. They learn
valuable lessons of unity, responsibility to self and others, and how to
overcome adversities. They encourage one another through winter weather, running through the
sand-hills of Nebraska, the sacred Black Hills of South Dakota, and the plains
and mountains of Montana. They gain a strong connection to the sacrifice of
their ancestors, and a greater appreciation for life. The run instills in them a sense of pride, higher
self-esteem, a deeper respect for their identity and sincere respect for
their homeland, and connection to mother earth.</p>
<p>Your donation will help these youth complete this journey. Contributions will help pay for food, transportation, lodging, warm clothing, and empowerment programming for the youth.   </p>

<p>The UnaBASHed Smiles Foundation was conceived by three friends, Allison Colson, Kalynn Amundson, and Scotty Zollars, who through the difficulties of a good friend became aware of the dental trauma suffered by many victims of LGBT bullying. He had endured several years of bullying and gay-bashing and was faced with the progressive demise of his upper teeth. Following several serious dental emergencies and a series of consultations and second opinions, he received a two-phase treatment plan with a total cost $25,000. Being self-employed as a professional singer, he clearly couldn’t afford this treatment on his own. To support him and others like him, in August of this past year the three friends created a crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo called UnaBASHed Smiles. The campaign raised 62% of the $10,000.00 goal (the amount needed for the first phase of treatment) and after the Indiegogo crowdfunding fees were deducted, the campaign earned a total of $5,472.72. Although this first campaign did not succeed in reaching the initial $10,000 goal, the campaign committee unanimously agreed to search out alternative means to fund the dental treatment plan for their friend and first campaign recipient.</p>
<p>Failure to reach the fund-raising goal, was not going to be allowed to result in failure to reach the campaign's initial objective, dental restoration for their friend and campaign recipient. </p>
<p>The campaign organizers needed a victory for their friend; they needed to show its generous donors the amazing achievement their financial support provided; and, most importantly, the campaign needed a success story with which to move forward and to become a vital non-profit organization in order to help the countless others who have suffered dental trauma from LGBT assaults.</p>
<p>As the committee explored ideas for funding the needed dental treatment, a campaign donor suggested seeking treatment outside the United States, specifically in Mexico where medical expenses are considerably less expensive. The committee, immediately and with caution, began to explore this option. After examining multiple clinics, the team was delighted to find one that considerately addressed all its concerns and would be able to complete the work with the limited campaign donations that had been received.</p>
<p>This clinic, the ConfiDent Smile Studio in Los Algodones, Baja California, Mexico, operates under the leadership of Dr. Danilo Gaspar who specializes in dental implantology. Working with Dr. Gaspar, the committee moved forward with the campaign and organized a treatment plan for their recipient. </p>
<p>The results were better than could have been imagined. The campaign recipient received impeccable dental care and amazing customer service; furthermore, the campaign saved over $17,000 by having the treatment completed in Los Algodones.</p>
<p>The success of this campaign is completely due to the kindness and generosity of its donors, and for that the committee is truly humble and thankful. The donors' commitment and support brought the campaign one step closer to helping LGBT people who have suffered dental trauma from assault.</p>
<p>It is clear that UnaBASHed Smiles can be successful, that it is a desperately needed organization, and that it must move forward and become a non-profit, charitable organization. The committee met on May 15, 2015, and worked on the following agenda: </p>
<p>1. Begin the process of establishing a non-profit foundation.</p>
<p>2. Establish a clear statement of purpose for the UnaBASHed Smiles Foundation.</p>
<p>3. Create articles of incorporation and by-laws.</p>
<p>4. Elect and establish a board of directors.</p>
<p>5. Determine terms of offices for the board of directors.</p>
<p>6. Establish the governing rules for the board of directors.</p>
<p>7. Explore and begin the process of officially applying for Section 501(c) (3) status. </p>
<p>8. Determine the foundation start-up expenses and begin researching methods for launching the foundation start-up funds campaign.</p>
<p>9. To publish a press release providing a status update on the foundation.</p>
<p>Once the foundation has voted on moving forward with its chosen start-up funding campaign, another update will be released and the start-up funding campaign will begin.</p>
<p>Again, this campaign could not have achieved its first success without all of its donors. Their generosity gives the committee great hope that many more LGTB youth and adults will soon have reason to smile.</p>

<h3></h3><p><b>Send Quidditch
Darmstadt to EQC'16 in Gallipoli</b></p>

<b>[English below]</b><br/>
</div>
<h3>Wer sind wir?</h3><div>
<p>Jetzt fragst du dich sicher: Quidditch? Was ist das?  </p>
<p>Quidditch basiert auf dem gleichnamigen Sport aus den Harry Potter Romanen.</p>
<p>Wir spielen auf Besen in gemischt-geschlechtlichen Teams. Chaser machen mit dem Quaffel Punkte, Beater verhindern das durch die Klatscher und natürlich beendet der Seeker durch den Schnatz- Fang das Spiel. Quidditch ist ein Vollkontakt- Sport und nichts für schwache Nerven oder Knochen!</p>
<p>Klingt verrückt, ist auch so!  Wir sind die Darmstädter Quidditch- Mannschaft und wir wollen uns jetzt endlich auch international beweisen!</p>
<p>So sah unser Team vor einem Jahr aus. Seitdem haben wir viel gelernt, viel trainiert und viele neue Spieler gewonnen, die alle unbedingt in Italien spielen wollen:</p> <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458161013/evpl24urwreyp73gxuji.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Was wollen wir?</h3>
<div>Wir haben es geschafft! Bei der 1. deutschen Quidditch- Meisterschaft hat sich Darmstadt für den European Quidditch Cup (EQC) in Italien, dem größten europäischen Turnier, qualifiziert! Nach einem genialen Turnier und hartem Training sind wir bereit für diese Herausforderung. Doch für das ""Brooms Up"" brauchen wir jetzt eure Hilfe! <p></p>
<p>Unterstütze uns auf unserem Weg. Durch die Geldspenden von euch wird es unserem Team ermöglicht nach Gallipoli in Italien zu reisen. Die Reise und die Teilnahme am Turnier sind nicht ganz günstig. So muss das Team die Flüge, die Unterkunft und die Teilnehmergebühren für das Team und jeden Spieler bezahlen. Mit ein bisschen finanzieller Unterstützung kann aber der Traum vom EQC wahr werden!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<h3>Wer gewinnt hier?</h3>
<p>mit eurer Hilfe natürlich wir </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>und was habt ihr davon?</h3>
<p>Natürlich geht ihr bei der Unterstützung nicht leer aus! Für jede Spende legt sich die Mannschaft so richtig ins Zeug. Als Gegenleistung erhaltet ihr verschiedene kreative und nützliche Geschenke aus Darmstadt! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Vielleicht wollt ihr eins unserer Trikots- komplett für euch alleine. So sehen sie aus: </p>

<h4>was will man noch alles wissen? FAQ:</h4>
<p></p>
<ul><li>""Wie funktioniert der Schnatz?""</li></ul>
<div>Der Schnatz wird von einem Schiedsrichter gespielt. Dieser hat einen Tennisball in einer Socke (=der Schnatz) hinten an seiner Hose befestigt. Die Sucher versuchen ihm diese abzunehmen und beenden dadurch das Spiel. Doch ganz so einfach ist das nicht - schließlich kann sich der Schnatz ja verteidigen <p></p>
<p></p>

[English below]

Wer sind wir?
Jetzt fragst du dich sicher: Quidditch? Was ist das?  
Quidditch basiert auf dem gleichnamigen Sport aus den Harry Potter Romanen.
Wir spielen auf Besen in gemischt-geschlechtlichen Teams. Chaser machen mit dem Quaffel Punkte, Beater verhindern das durch die Klatscher und natürlich beendet der Seeker durch den Schnatz- Fang das Spiel. Quidditch ist ein Vollkontakt- Sport und nichts für schwache Nerven oder Knochen!
Klingt verrückt, ist auch so!  Wir sind die Darmstädter Quidditch- Mannschaft und wir wollen uns jetzt endlich auch international beweisen!
So sah unser Team vor einem Jahr aus. Seitdem haben wir viel gelernt, viel trainiert und viele neue Spieler gewonnen, die alle unbedingt in Italien spielen wollen: 


Was wollen wir?
Wir haben es geschafft! Bei der 1. deutschen Quidditch- Meisterschaft hat sich Darmstadt für den European Quidditch Cup (EQC) in Italien, dem größten europäischen Turnier, qualifiziert! Nach einem genialen Turnier und hartem Training sind wir bereit für diese Herausforderung. Doch für das ""Brooms Up"" brauchen wir jetzt eure Hilfe! 
Unterstütze uns auf unserem Weg. Durch die Geldspenden von euch wird es unserem Team ermöglicht nach Gallipoli in Italien zu reisen. Die Reise und die Teilnahme am Turnier sind nicht ganz günstig. So muss das Team die Flüge, die Unterkunft und die Teilnehmergebühren für das Team und jeden Spieler bezahlen. Mit ein bisschen finanzieller Unterstützung kann aber der Traum vom EQC wahr werden!


Wer gewinnt hier?
mit eurer Hilfe natürlich wir 


und was habt ihr davon?
Natürlich geht ihr bei der Unterstützung nicht leer aus! Für jede Spende legt sich die Mannschaft so richtig ins Zeug. Als Gegenleistung erhaltet ihr verschiedene kreative und nützliche Geschenke aus Darmstadt! 

Vielleicht wollt ihr eins unserer Trikots- komplett für euch alleine. So sehen sie aus: 




oder eventuell gefällt euch ja auch eins unsere selbst- designten T-Shirts:



Falls du ein T- Shirt haben möchtest, buche den Perk ""T-Shirt"". Danach kontaktieren wir dich und gehen sicher, dass du dein Lieblings- Design bekommst!
[English: if you want to get one of our t- shirts, book the perk ""t- shirt"". Afterwards we will contact you and make sure you will get you favorite design]  

außerdem haben wir viele, viele schöne weitere Perks. Und ihr bekommt viele schöne Kleinigkeiten von uns, zum Beispiel unsere Buttons oder Sticker:





was will man noch alles wissen? FAQ:

""Wie funktioniert der Schnatz?""
Der Schnatz wird von einem Schiedsrichter gespielt. Dieser hat einen Tennisball in einer Socke (=der Schnatz) hinten an seiner Hose befestigt. Die Sucher versuchen ihm diese abzunehmen und beenden dadurch das Spiel. Doch ganz so einfach ist das nicht - schließlich kann sich der Schnatz ja verteidigen 

""Wie fliegt ihr eigentlich?""
Leider fliegen wir gar nicht. Quidditch wird auf dem Boden laufend gespielt. Bei fliegenden Besen macht die Technik leider noch nicht mit 
""Echt? Ihr lauft mit Besen zwischen den Beinen?""
Oh ja! Bei jeder Sportart gibt es ein Handicap. Bei manchen ist es Eine Schritte- Regel und bei uns ist es halt der Besen! Er muss ständig zwischen den Beinen getragen werden.

</p><p><b>Dementia in Ghana</b></p><p></p>
<p>The world population is getting older and along with
aging the prevalence of dementia is on the rise, as the syndrome is most common
among elderly. This phenomenon is especially taking place in low-to
middle-income countries. With regard to the African region, Ghana is one of the
countries affected most with an expected population growth of 147% by the time
of 2030. With the expected increase of older people in Ghana, the prevalence of
dementia will also rise for which it is becoming a major problem. When affected
with dementia the need for care increases resulting in dependency. However, the
awareness about dementia in Ghana is low and formal care for mental health is
lacking. As a result, the persons affected with dementia become reliant on the
informal care provided by their family members, which impact their lives
drastically.  </p>
<p><b>Burden on families</b></p>
<p>People affected with dementia eventually need 24 hour
care which the family has to provide due to lack of support and limited health
care facilities. As a result, it is seen that family members have to give up
their jobs and social lives, as there is no other solution for them. Giving up
their jobs and high hospital costs creates high financial burden on the
families. The care that is needed cannot be provided and the lives of family
members are affected considerably on physical and emotional levels. It is
therefore to bad that the government of Ghana acknowledges and supports mental
health only limited and dementia is not supported at all. The awareness about dementia
in Ghana is very low. Many people have never even heard of dementia and
perceive it as something that is belonging to old age, which is not the case. </p>
<p><b>What is
dementia?</b></p>
<p>Dementia is used as an umbrella term for a range of
diseases, which cause a progressive deterioration in the brains structure and
cognitive function. Some examples are diseases like Alzheimer’s, Pick’s
Disease, Vascular Dementia and Lewy Bodies Dementia. The symptoms of dementia
can vary. The most common symptoms are confusion, memory loss, slurred speech,
repeatedly asking the same questions, depression, changes in mood and
personality.  </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
<p>My name is Jente Bosma, a student
at the VU University in Holland. I study International Public Health and am
currently performing my internship at Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders
Association of Ghana (ARDAG) to finish my master programme. In Holland I have
been working in an elderly home for more than 5 years and my own grandmother is
suffering from dementia, which triggered my interest for elderly care and in
particular dementia. When reading the latest report of Alzheimer’s Disease
International it became clear to me that the prevalence of dementia is mostly
present in low- and middle income countries and is growing fastest in these
regions. That is why I decided to do my research in Ghana. </p>
<p>When coming to Ghana, I was
surprised. The awareness about the existence of dementia is low. Many people
have never even heard of it and perceive it as something belonging to old age.
As dementia is not acknowledged as a disease, the government is not doing
anything for people suffering with dementia laying a heavy burden on family
members who are doomed to take care of their relative with dementia. My
research is about the impact of living with someone with dementia on family
members and caregivers. In order to retrieve data I visit the families and see
how they are suffering both financially and emotionally. With no support from
the government, someone has to stand up for them. </p>
<p><b>Alzheimer’s and Related Disorder Association of Ghana</b></p>
<p>ARDAG is the only association in
Ghana that addresses the needs of people with dementia and their families and
who tries to create a society where people with dementia can live with honour
and dignity. ARDAG is an NGO, which is a non-governmental, non-religious and
non-profit making organization, established in 2012, with charity number: CG015022012.
The reason for the establishment was an incident in 2010 in Tema, Ghana, where
a 72-year-old woman was burned to death, in the belief that she was a witch. In
fact, the women showed signs of dementia. The organisation is aimed at raising
awareness of all forms of dementia throughout Ghana. The aim is to eliminate
the stigma attached to the disease through available media, and also to create
a society, which is dementia friendly, dementia literate and where a person
with dementia can live with dignity and honour.</p>
<p><b>What does ARDAG do?</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>In order to achieve our aims, ARDAG performs multiple
activities. The main activities of ARDAG include:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Awareness creation</span></li></ul>
<p>Awareness is the major key to break the silence and stigma
surrounding Dementia. In view of these, ARDAG has started intensive awareness
campaign programmes with the general public as a target including the
government and policy makers.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>We organize training programmes and workshops for
volunteers, professionals, and educational institutions. We also offer
information and advice on a wide range of dementia related subjects.</p>
<p><b>Purpose of the campaign</b></p>
<p>The reason we started this campaign
is to increase the health care for people with dementia in Ghana and to
decrease the burden on their families. Many people in Ghana live in poverty and
the high financial burden on families, who are living with someone affected
with dementia, makes it important to intervene on this issue.  Providing home care for every person affected
with dementia is costly and difficult to arrange. With the establishment of a
day care centre the family is released of caregiver stress and less caregivers
are needed to take care of multiple persons with dementia making this approach
more cost-effective and sustainable. </p>
<p>Recently, ARDAG was generously
offered a land in order to establish the first health care centre for dementia
in Ghana. However, this has not yet been realised since the NGO receives no
financial support from the government and funding from companies and other
institutions is small and hard to retrieve as many people don’t know what
dementia is. As the land in Ghana is in fact very costly, it is of great
importance to collect enough funding and start building the place before it
will be taken away for other purposes. </p>
<p>The establishment will function as
a ‘day care centre’ in order to give families of people with dementia the
opportunity to bring their relative for a period of time during the day. In
this way people affected with dementia will get proper care and the family
members are able to go to work, to do groceries or other important daily
activities. At the day care centre, dementia trained staf will provide care
consisting out of a psychologist, a neurologist, social workers and nurses. The
day care centre will offer shelter, food, medicines and other essential needs
for meeting the health needs of people with dementia.  </p>

So many in Haiti have nothing to hope for. There is very little to be encouraged by.  There seemed to be little national pride which leads people to be about self not community. At the same time there was a clear love of futball/soccer.
Upon returning home I began to dream, with my then 9 year old son, of running a futball/soccer camp and giving out Haiti shirts to those attending to help bring happiness, even if for only a few days, and hopefully begin the seeds of national pride in even just a few. 
There are no quick remedies to broken societal structures, but if we each do what we can, we become a part of healing.  Some heal with medicine, some with money, but we are attempting to heal with a Vision and a Ball.     What We Need & What You Get In this first year we are running a camp for 60 boys and girls.  Each child will receive a custom Haiti shirt as well as food and drinks while at camp.  There will be awards including medals for skills competitions, top player awards, and new balls given to the winning team of our concluding tournament.  All of these items add up quickly for one person but here is how you can help.
For $35 you can pay for one child to receive a week of camp and take away a lifetime of memories.  
For $25 you can pay for a ball to be used at camp.  All balls are being left in the community to be used when we are gone.
For $12 you can pay for a Haiti shirt for a child at camp OR for food and water for that child for the week.
Both lead coaches are licensed and trained while my son (who will be coaching the younger players) has 9 years of playing experience. He looks forward to the day when he runs this camp in Haiti and beyond.    Risks & Challenges Though I am hopeful and excited there are some great difficulties ahead.  It is often challenging getting items of value through customs.  Occasionally money is needed to speed the process or you may never find your bags when you disembark your plane. But even if these barriers get in our way we are determined to not only run camp this Summer, but for many yet to come.     Be sure to follow this journey on:

<h3>After numerous setbacks over the past couple of years, including my loss of two jobs (after holding the earlier job for over 19 years!), deaths in the family, serious accidents and illnesses, having to replace a car, to name only a few things, my wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer.  Although she has health insurance - thank god! - the deductibles/co-payments and loss of her income will be a major set-back for our family (we have four kids) as I continue to struggle to find another job.</h3>

<p>A common scenario for women emerging
from breast cancer treatment is that they are faced with a multitude of issues
affecting their physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Their vital
functions like digestion, respiration and heart rate are impaired. And more:
They often avoid touching others or being touched. They feel the need for
physical and emotional revitalization. </p>
<p>The medical profession does not
attend to these ensuing issues once treatment is completed. In many ways these
women are similar to returning war veterans with PTSD symptoms.  Like the
many horse programs around the country helping returning veterans with PTSD,
Riding Beyond is designed to help women recovering from breast cancer treatment
to find physical and emotional revitalization .</p>
<p>You are probably familiar with the
growing popularity of therapy animals like dogs and cats for easing people’s
lives in many situations. For me, though, it’s about horses.  I believe in
the power of the horse/human connection to bring new life to people and even to
our world. This belief has been confirmed over and over again the past 25 years
during my career in therapeutic riding — as a certified therapeutic riding
instructor and certified equine specialist in mental health and learning, as
well as executive director of two premier accredited therapeutic riding
programs. I have personally witnessed countless examples. A child began
speaking for the first time at age 6 because of a horse. A man with head injuries
got out of a wheelchair and walked unaided because of riding a horse. Through a
program I developed, at risk teens from a residential treatment center
discovered new directions when horses introduced them to their larger lives.
 This program was later the foundation for my book <i>Riding Into Your Mythic
Life: Transformational Adventures with the Horse.</i> (New World Library,
2007) </p>
<p>Last summer Riding Beyond conducted a
pilot program where the horse Mystic helped women claim new vitality and a
fresh sense of direction for their lives following the rigors of breast cancer
treatment. </p>
<p>This program is important to me
personally because I have accompanied two friends closely through their
journeys with Stage 4 breast cancer and as a result I have a lot of respect and
compassion for the suffering and courage required to take this journey.  </p>
<p>Riding Beyond is based on a program
developed by a woman who was dying of the effects of her radiation treatment
seven years ago and through an inspired encounter with her horse, discovered
the road to recovery. Since then she has offered her program to women in
southern California. Exercises that she developed help to improve blood
circulation and oxygenation, respiration and blood pressure, as well as to
improve balance, strength and endurance in four sessions  or an all day
session. I have adapted her program to include activities that expand
possibilities for the future of women’s lives. Activities like story telling
and riding to music explore emotionally and spiritually an expanded
understanding of the participant’s larger life. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572972/files/20140511232918-RIDINGBEYONDLOGOtiny.jpg?1399876158"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p>
<p>We got started with two participants
last September with the help of over 60 volunteers who worked throughout the
summer to make the pilot program a reality. Now we need your help to expand the
program to serve 36 women. If we exceed our goal, your contributions will fund
the creation of training materials for establishing the program in other parts
of the world. And we’ll add a second horse to the program for further expansion
and to share the work when Mystic needs a break.</p>
<p>This year we anticipate 4 sessions of
Riding Beyond June through September and two all day sessions serving a total
of 36 women for this year. Our budget for this program for the year is nearly
$29,000, covering horse and equipment expenses, training of volunteers, program
promotion, insurance, facility rental, administration and professional fees.
 Your tax deductible gift, whether it’s $5 or more, can help make Riding Beyond a
reality.  Regardless of your ability to give money, your best gift to
Riding Beyond is for you to share our campaign far and wide: to breast cancer
survivors, their friends and families and to people who are horse
enthusiasts. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/573164/files/20140512022919-Screen_Shot_2014-05-12_at_2.27.23_AM.png?1399886959"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Everyone who gives to the campaign
will receive a high resolution, electronic poster called Advice from Mystic
with a beautiful image by professional photographer Cornelius Matteo who has contributed his extraordinary work to Riding Beyond as seen throughout our campaign, as well
as periodic updates in the form of stories and photos throughout the four
months that we are in session. If you give $1000 or more, I will take you or a
friend on a half day trail ride on the Pacific Crest Trail, among the best
trail riding available anywhere in the world. We’ll be posting more perks over
the coming weeks, so check back with us. The greatest perk, though, is your
satisfaction in helping to establish a program that attends to the needs of so
many women. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572974/files/20140511232944-RIDINGBEYONDLOGOtiny.jpg?1399876184"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<p>Most of the women who have gone
through radiation and chemotherapy treatment have ongoing issues to deal with,

<p><b>Here is how Riding Beyond helps.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572991/files/20140511234417-JanTouch.jpg?1399877057"" src="""" style=""width: 321.0566666666667px; height: 403px;""/></b></p><b>TOUCH</b><p></p>
<p>The act of touching a beautiful,
calm, and sensitive large animal like a horse who responds with sighs and other
signs of enjoyment opens participants to the wonder and power of touch in a
non-threatening and potent environment. This experience is an important first step in
Riding Beyond. </p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572992/files/20140511234528-LyingOnBack.jpg?1399877128"" src="""" style=""width: 423.42028985507244px; height: 332px;""/></b></p><b>LYING ON THE HORSE</b><p></p>
<p>Lying on the back of a horse for 60
seconds or longer, face-down on the horse’s rump, activates the part of the
vagus nerve which runs along the front of the body.  Several
things occur with this exercise.  There is a gentle compression of the
diaphragm and lungs.  There is an energetic connection between the horse’s
body and the woman’s body so that respiration and heart rate entrain with the
slower rates of the horse.  This effect has been measured in scientific
research:</p>
<p><i>Recent studies conducted by the
Institute of HeartMath provide a clue to explain the bidirectional
""healing"" that happens when we are near horses. According to
researchers, the heart has a larger electromagnetic field and higher level of
intelligence than the brain: A magnetometer can measure the heart's energy
field radiating up to 8 to 10 feet around the human body. While this is
certainly significant it is perhaps more impressive that the electromagnetic
field projected by the horse's heart is five times larger than the human one
(imagine a sphere-shaped field that completely surrounds you). The horse's
electromagnetic field is also stronger than ours and can actually directly
influence our own heart rhythm.</i></p>
<p><i>Horses are also likely to have what
science has identified as a ""coherent"" heart rhythm (heart rate
pattern) which explains why we may ""feel better"" when we are around
them. . . .studies have found that a coherent heart pattern or HRV is a robust
measure of well-being and consistent with emotional states of calm and
joy--that is, we exhibit such patterns when we feel positive emotions.</i></p>
<p><i>A coherent heart pattern is
indicative of a system that can recover and adjust to stressful situations very
efficiently. Often times, we only need to be in a horse’s presence to feel a
sense of wellness and peace. In fact, research shows that people experience
many physiological benefits while interacting with horses, including lowered
blood pressure and heart rate, increased levels of beta-endorphins
(neurotransmitters that serve as pain suppressors), decreased stress levels,
reduced feelings of anger, hostility, tension and anxiety, improved social
functioning; and increased feelings of empowerment, trust, patience and
self-efficacy.</i></p>
<p>Often upon rising up from the prone
position, a woman is able to take a deep, abdominal breath for the first time
in months. Measurements of heart rate before and after this exercise show
measurable improvements in both heart rate and oxygen levels in the
blood. </p>
<p>Since the vagus nerve controls the
autonomic nervous system, improvements in digestion and other functions are benefitted,
as well. </p>
<p>Participants practice lying on a
horse’s back at the beginning of each session by mounting a specially
constructed barrel horse. </p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572996/files/20140511234656-MusicWalk.jpg?1399877216"" src="""" style=""width: 547.8546511627907px; height: 391px;""/></b></p><b>SYNCHRONIZED MOVEMENT TO MUSIC</b><p></p>
<p>Initially, participants walk side by
side with the horse and then later on the back of the horse, in synchrony with
inspiring music.  This promotes a deep level of relaxation and
reconnection with the horse and the others walking along.  There is often
an experience of ecstasy that goes beyond words. </p>

<p>Exercises develop the use of the
imagination and, more, the imaginal body or the muscular imagination, to
vividly focus and to align themselves with their higher purpose.  These
exercises take advantage of neural plasticity and make available to the participant
parts of their brains previously untapped. </p>

<p>A fundamental purpose of Riding
Beyond is to explore the threads of the larger patterns of our lives,
reconfiguring one’s challenges in the context of a larger destiny.  This
is accomplished through fictional and true life story telling, creative word
play and reading of poetry and other relevant inspirational passages. </p>

<p>Riding a horse at a walk and
responding to the complex movement, which is side to side, back and forth and
rotational, stimulates nerves and muscles to increase strength and improve
balance and proprioception. </p>

<p>One of the most powerful experiences

of the heart.”  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572976/files/20140511233051-RIDINGBEYONDLOGOtiny.jpg?1399876251"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>HOW RIDING BEYOND CAME TO BE</b></p>
<p>After a career of teaching riding and
training horses, I turned over 25 years ago to therapeutic riding because I
felt that there were so many larger benefits to the horse human relationship
that went beyond competition and I wanted to offer these benefits to a larger
audience. </p>
<p>I established the Saddle Light Center
in San Antonio Texas and later reopened the HOPE Equestrian Center in the Rogue
Valley.  I worked with at-risk teens in a summer program which showed them
how the trials and tribulations of their lives were in actuality the
whisperings of their destiny calling them on their own hero’s journey.  I
wrote a book about it: Riding Into Your Mythic Life: Transformational
Adventures with the Horse. </p>
<p>For the past ten years I have taught
Journey Horse, here and in Australia, which are modern day vision quests with
horses, as well as other seminars for professionals in equine assisted
activities and therapies. About a year ago I began to yearn to offer something
of my work to my home community here in the Rogue Valley.</p>
<p>Last spring I was presenting my work
at Prescott Best Practices conference and I heard about a remarkable program in
southern California established 7 years ago.  There was a bit of magic
about it, because I met Catherine Hand briefly when we sat next to one another
at the opening address. She invited me to her presentation, which I probably
would have missed otherwise. At the presentation she told how seven years ago
she was in hospice, dying of damage to her heart and lungs from her radiation
treatment for breast cancer. She had given away her dogs and all but one of her
horses.  One day, she said, she read a book Riding Into Your Mythic Life
and was inspired. It occurred to her that perhaps the story handed her by the
medical profession did not need to be her own story.  (She commented that
the author of that book was somewhere at the conference and to everyone’s
delight I let her know right then that we had already met.)  That day
seven years ago, with the help of a friend she felt inspired to climb onto the
back of her one remaining horse and lay down on the horse’s rump.  Two
days later a hospice nurse asked her what she was doing to be getting better.
 Her rapid heart rate had improved and her oxygenation levels had
increased.  It took her a while to remember that the only thing she’d done
different was to climb on that horse’s back.  After that, she partnered
with a medical professional and pursued her insight, and over the next weeks
she left hospice care, and within the next year she got well and proceeded to
establish the program that she offers in southern California. </p>
<p>I came home from Arizona inspired to
offer Riding Beyond to my own community. Over 60 people pitched in, helping in
so many different ways.   People and a horse got trained, we gathered or
constructed the equipment we needed, and then we conducted the pilot program in
September. </p>
<p><b>PARTICIPANTS IN THE PILOT PROGRAM
SAID</b></p>
<p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572985/files/20140511233927-Jan3.jpg?1399876767"" src="""" style=""width: 302.23348017621146px; height: 378px;""/></i></p><i>""I came to Riding Beyond with only
the expectation that I would get to know a tiny bit about horses and maybe find
some small happiness for the moment. </i><p></p>
<p><i>I’d gone through a very difficult
year – a diagnosis of cancer and the loss of my beloved youngest daughter. Joy
was hard to come by. Grief was an every day companion. . . </i></p>
<p><i>I went to the first day of the
program with pretty much no idea whether I’d get bucked off a frisky horse or
have a spontaneous healing like ones I’d heard about. Trish had explained the
program, but with my extremely limited exposure to horses I don’t think
anything really gelled. Well, I was in for one of the most treasured and
healing experiences I’ve had in this rocky road of life. This would be a
healing of the heart.</i></p>
<p><i>Mystic’s calm, quiet presence quickly
infused me, and I found myself really falling in love with something in her
that was tangibly intangible. </i></p>
<p><i>I found in the following weeks of the
program that I was constantly bringing up her image in my mind when I felt
stressed or sad or even happy. Just the thought of her would calm my mind and
bring a feeling of contentment, peace, wellbeing. On one occasion I was feeling
some deep angst and restlessness and couldn’t really put my finger on the
cause. I then thought of Mystic, almost automatically, like some people reach
for a sedative. Immediately a huge, huge wave of grief enveloped me. The
release was like the wave of a tsunami and the minutes after were like floating
in an endless quiet sea.</i></p>
<p><i>Another time I was praying and
meditating but thoughts kept racing in and out, and grief and sadness and
confusion kept tormenting me. Again my mind automatically went to Mystic and
very surprisingly, in an instant, I became profoundly calm, very quiet, at
peace. Well, I didn’t know what to think of that but hey, I’d take it. And so
went the love affair with the horse, Mystic. I am so grateful.”</i></p>
<p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572984/files/20140511233726-Leslie.jpg?1399876646"" src="""" style=""width: 352.0887096774194px; height: 297px;""/></i></p><i>“I really appreciate the opportunity
that I had to participate in the pilot program for Riding Beyond.  Each
time I left the ranch after these sessions, I had such a feeling of peace and
well-being (it reminded me that I could feel that way!).  The sessions
included time to share experiences and poems.  The whole team participated
in these discussions which resulted in some interesting conversations and ideas
that I had not thought of previously.</i><p></p>
<p><i>In addition to the health/mind
benefits, this experience helped me to overcome my fear of horses.  Trish
and the volunteers shared their knowledge of horses and were there the entire
time – so I felt safe.  And, of course, the star of the show, Mystic, is
an amazing horse.  She is calm, sweet, and patient.  I enjoyed the
time I spent with Mystic and am now looking forward to taking horseback riding
lessons!</i></p>
<p><i>It was an extremely positive
experience that I would highly recommend to others.”</i></p>
<p><b>SEVEN MONTHS LATER</b></p>
<p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572983/files/20140511233554-00005_1__00002.jpeg?1399876554"" src="""" style=""width: 497.77777777777777px; height: 280px;""/></i></p><i>“The program
ended but Mystic is a permanent fixture in my life, coming to me in moments of
stress and of joy. I had no idea a horse could do that, no idea. It has
supported me through my ongoing treatment: Mystic is a huge piece of my
well-being. So much had been wiped away by my diagnosis and the death of my
daughter, so many of my assumptions of what life was supposed to be were gone.
Maybe because of that I was able to take what she had to give. I always thought
of horses as big and scary, and I found when I was with her, who she was came
out, a giant presence of love and sweetness. It came into me as someone who
walks beside you when you walk through these kinds of times. It's a pure
relationship without all the baggage with people. She really fills me up.”</i><p></p>
<p><b>VOLUNTEERS SAID</b></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572981/files/20140511233438-Jen.jpg?1399876478"" src="""" style=""width: 357.98319327731093px; height: 284px;""/></p>“The individual details of our
stories, we did not share. We did not need to know. By sensing together we
created a place to cultivate reverence, awe, grace, dignity and respect. The
courage to walk with horses, not knowing and being vulnerable, allowed us to
weave together our own story, one of deep connection and belonging. Whether you
are a volunteer or participant, the wisdom and magic of horses exists for you.
Allow it and it will change your life. I am Jenny, a Riding Beyond volunteer
and because I dared to be a part of Riding Beyond, I have grown. Thank you,
Riding Beyond volunteers, participants, and of course the horses. Your courage

spirits of the other volunteers, all from different backgrounds  and
experiences yet I felt at home right away. My gifts were acknowledged,
appreciated and cared for. Each person was  assigned a place to be of help
within their comfort level,  no matter their experience with horses or
cancer for that matter. People and animals were held with gentleness, grace and
appreciation. Laughter rang out, a few tears ran down cheeks, warmth exploded
out of our space, (in spite of one very icy Ashland day), chickens cheered us
on and I even got hugged by a horse. What a way to spend a morning. Then we had
the blessing of meeting the participants , brave woman finishing a tough course
of treatment and trusting us to help them take a new step on their journey of
healing. An intuitive horse partner, a trained facilitator and amazing
volunteers. We got to watch the magic unfold. It really doesn’t get any
better. Join us and be inspired.<p></p>
<p>I can also add: since I am a breast
cancer survivor, I inadvertently received a healing blessing from Mystic, who
took time to get to know me and nuzzled her nose on the exact area I first
found my lump….how’s that for intuitive? She then proceeded to give me a horse
hug , gently wrapping her beautiful neck around my leg and holding me. Guess
she knew we all need love.” —Mary Piper</p>
<p><b>LARGER MATTERS</b></p>
<p>Although I have not personally
experienced breast cancer, I have accompanied several friends through their own
treatment, and I have witnessed first-hand the suffering and courage that is
required by women who take this journey.  It is life-changing, challenging
their most intimate sense of self and personal identity. My friends were huge
inspirations to me. </p>
<p>I believe that women who face breast
cancer are ambassadors of the rise of the feminine in the evolutionary process
that we are all participating in, not the rise of feminism, but the rise of the
unique qualities of the feminine soul for nurturing life and finding
life-giving solutions to problems instead of resorting to warfare and violence.
They have the potential to be those who can pioneer a new way, having gone
through a fire that hones their purpose to laser clarity. </p>
<p>To have breast cancer is
intrinsically involved in what it takes to overcome enormous challenges, and to
gather resources to separate one's identity as a person from the disease at an
intimate level, to find who they are as strong and creative beings. Breast cancer
can strike at their most intimate sense of self and personal identity. Riding
Beyond offers an experience of their core selves as creative and strong,
keeping them in touch with creativity and strength so that they can claim their
personal possibilities for this larger destiny. They are a keystone species
critical to the unfolding of something new and life-sustaining for our world’s
long-term future. </p>
<p><b>DEDICATION</b></p>
<p>This work is dedicated to those
friends of mine who have met the cancer challenge and other women like them around the world.  </p>
<p>It is also dedicated to the
remarkable horses who have demonstrated their willingness,
wisdom and enthusiasm for engaging with humans for such elegant and effective
healing purposes. </p>

work, I will be attending a Sundance at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South
Dakota for the summer solstice. Although I have been invited to this sundance
for many years, this is the first time that I feel compelled to attend. It is
held at a wild horse sanctuary, and I intend that four days of dancing and
fasting and praying will anchor and launch the future of Riding Beyond, as well
as benefit our wider stewardship of the earth. <p></p>
<p>I believe in the power of the horse
human connection because it’s this kind of bridging between species, partnering
with horses in this case, that is a critical practice for the survival of our
world, a world  where so many bridges between peoples and between us and
our planet desperately need to be forged. </p>
<p>With our horses, it means making
performance goals secondary to relationship goals, so that winning a blue
ribbon is not nearly so important as being able to listen deeply to the
language of a horse, learning their language and involving  them in our
deep and ongoing life journeys as a teacher and companion.  With our
fellow human beings, it leads us to new ways of living and being, bringing
balance to our lives for healing, finding new ways of leadership that are
essentially collaborative, and implementing what we know about our all being
connected as one world on planet Earth. </p>

Horses
are associated in our imaginations with grand tales of heroism and adventure,
large movement and beauty. This is their mythic aspect. And by engaging with
horses from that perspective, they introduce us to our own mythic lives and

<p></p></div>","Opening Doors to the Future
A common scenario for women emerging
from breast cancer treatment is that they are faced with a multitude of issues
affecting their physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Their vital
functions like digestion, respiration and heart rate are impaired. And more:
They often avoid touching others or being touched. They feel the need for
physical and emotional revitalization. 
The medical profession does not
attend to these ensuing issues once treatment is completed. In many ways these
women are similar to returning war veterans with PTSD symptoms.  Like the
many horse programs around the country helping returning veterans with PTSD,
Riding Beyond is designed to help women recovering from breast cancer treatment
to find physical and emotional revitalization .
You are probably familiar with the
growing popularity of therapy animals like dogs and cats for easing people’s
lives in many situations. For me, though, it’s about horses.  I believe in
the power of the horse/human connection to bring new life to people and even to
our world. This belief has been confirmed over and over again the past 25 years
during my career in therapeutic riding — as a certified therapeutic riding
instructor and certified equine specialist in mental health and learning, as
well as executive director of two premier accredited therapeutic riding
programs. I have personally witnessed countless examples. A child began
speaking for the first time at age 6 because of a horse. A man with head injuries
got out of a wheelchair and walked unaided because of riding a horse. Through a
program I developed, at risk teens from a residential treatment center
discovered new directions when horses introduced them to their larger lives.
 This program was later the foundation for my book Riding Into Your Mythic
Life: Transformational Adventures with the Horse. (New World Library,
2007) 
Last summer Riding Beyond conducted a
pilot program where the horse Mystic helped women claim new vitality and a
fresh sense of direction for their lives following the rigors of breast cancer
treatment. 
This program is important to me
personally because I have accompanied two friends closely through their
journeys with Stage 4 breast cancer and as a result I have a lot of respect and
compassion for the suffering and courage required to take this journey.  
Riding Beyond is based on a program
developed by a woman who was dying of the effects of her radiation treatment
seven years ago and through an inspired encounter with her horse, discovered
the road to recovery. Since then she has offered her program to women in
southern California. Exercises that she developed help to improve blood
circulation and oxygenation, respiration and blood pressure, as well as to
improve balance, strength and endurance in four sessions  or an all day
session. I have adapted her program to include activities that expand
possibilities for the future of women’s lives. Activities like story telling
and riding to music explore emotionally and spiritually an expanded
understanding of the participant’s larger life. 
What We Need & What You Get
We got started with two participants
last September with the help of over 60 volunteers who worked throughout the
summer to make the pilot program a reality. Now we need your help to expand the
program to serve 36 women. If we exceed our goal, your contributions will fund
the creation of training materials for establishing the program in other parts
of the world. And we’ll add a second horse to the program for further expansion
and to share the work when Mystic needs a break.
This year we anticipate 4 sessions of
Riding Beyond June through September and two all day sessions serving a total
of 36 women for this year. Our budget for this program for the year is nearly
$29,000, covering horse and equipment expenses, training of volunteers, program
promotion, insurance, facility rental, administration and professional fees.
 Your tax deductible gift, whether it’s $5 or more, can help make Riding Beyond a
reality.  Regardless of your ability to give money, your best gift to
Riding Beyond is for you to share our campaign far and wide: to breast cancer
survivors, their friends and families and to people who are horse
enthusiasts. 
Everyone who gives to the campaign
will receive a high resolution, electronic poster called Advice from Mystic
with a beautiful image by professional photographer Cornelius Matteo who has contributed his extraordinary work to Riding Beyond as seen throughout our campaign, as well
as periodic updates in the form of stories and photos throughout the four
months that we are in session. If you give $1000 or more, I will take you or a
friend on a half day trail ride on the Pacific Crest Trail, among the best
trail riding available anywhere in the world. We’ll be posting more perks over
the coming weeks, so check back with us. The greatest perk, though, is your
satisfaction in helping to establish a program that attends to the needs of so
many women. The Impact
Most of the women who have gone
through radiation and chemotherapy treatment have ongoing issues to deal with,
like these:


They need physical and emotional revitalization. 


Vital functions have been impaired,
like digestion, respiration (shallow breathing) and rapid heart rate.


Self image is impacted by surgery and
chemotherapy and radiation treatment. 


Tactile defensiveness: not enjoying
touch or being touched. 


A need to reconnect to her body and
to others. 


Physical weakness. 


Here is how Riding Beyond helps.
TOUCH
The act of touching a beautiful,
calm, and sensitive large animal like a horse who responds with sighs and other
signs of enjoyment opens participants to the wonder and power of touch in a
non-threatening and potent environment. This experience is an important first step in
Riding Beyond. 
LYING ON THE HORSE
Lying on the back of a horse for 60
seconds or longer, face-down on the horse’s rump, activates the part of the
vagus nerve which runs along the front of the body.  Several
things occur with this exercise.  There is a gentle compression of the
diaphragm and lungs.  There is an energetic connection between the horse’s
body and the woman’s body so that respiration and heart rate entrain with the
slower rates of the horse.  This effect has been measured in scientific
research:
Recent studies conducted by the
Institute of HeartMath provide a clue to explain the bidirectional
""healing"" that happens when we are near horses. According to
researchers, the heart has a larger electromagnetic field and higher level of
intelligence than the brain: A magnetometer can measure the heart's energy
field radiating up to 8 to 10 feet around the human body. While this is
certainly significant it is perhaps more impressive that the electromagnetic
field projected by the horse's heart is five times larger than the human one
(imagine a sphere-shaped field that completely surrounds you). The horse's
electromagnetic field is also stronger than ours and can actually directly
influence our own heart rhythm.
Horses are also likely to have what
science has identified as a ""coherent"" heart rhythm (heart rate
pattern) which explains why we may ""feel better"" when we are around
them. . . .studies have found that a coherent heart pattern or HRV is a robust
measure of well-being and consistent with emotional states of calm and
joy--that is, we exhibit such patterns when we feel positive emotions.
A coherent heart pattern is
indicative of a system that can recover and adjust to stressful situations very
efficiently. Often times, we only need to be in a horse’s presence to feel a
sense of wellness and peace. In fact, research shows that people experience
many physiological benefits while interacting with horses, including lowered
blood pressure and heart rate, increased levels of beta-endorphins
(neurotransmitters that serve as pain suppressors), decreased stress levels,
reduced feelings of anger, hostility, tension and anxiety, improved social
functioning; and increased feelings of empowerment, trust, patience and
self-efficacy.
Often upon rising up from the prone
position, a woman is able to take a deep, abdominal breath for the first time
in months. Measurements of heart rate before and after this exercise show
measurable improvements in both heart rate and oxygen levels in the
blood. 
Since the vagus nerve controls the
autonomic nervous system, improvements in digestion and other functions are benefitted,
as well. 
Participants practice lying on a
horse’s back at the beginning of each session by mounting a specially
constructed barrel horse. 
SYNCHRONIZED MOVEMENT TO MUSIC
Initially, participants walk side by
side with the horse and then later on the back of the horse, in synchrony with
inspiring music.  This promotes a deep level of relaxation and
reconnection with the horse and the others walking along.  There is often
an experience of ecstasy that goes beyond words. 
MIND/BRAIN EXERCISES
Exercises develop the use of the
imagination and, more, the imaginal body or the muscular imagination, to
vividly focus and to align themselves with their higher purpose.  These
exercises take advantage of neural plasticity and make available to the participant
parts of their brains previously untapped. 
EXPLORING THE LARGER LIFE 
A fundamental purpose of Riding
Beyond is to explore the threads of the larger patterns of our lives,
reconfiguring one’s challenges in the context of a larger destiny.  This
is accomplished through fictional and true life story telling, creative word
play and reading of poetry and other relevant inspirational passages. 
STRENGTH AND BALANCE
Riding a horse at a walk and
responding to the complex movement, which is side to side, back and forth and
rotational, stimulates nerves and muscles to increase strength and improve
balance and proprioception. 
BONDING
One of the most powerful experiences
for all involved is the bonding between the horse and the people, participants
and volunteers alike. Riding Beyond is full of heart-opening moments. As one
participant remarked with wonder; “I discovered I was in for a profound healing
of the heart.”  
HOW RIDING BEYOND CAME TO BE
After a career of teaching riding and
training horses, I turned over 25 years ago to therapeutic riding because I
felt that there were so many larger benefits to the horse human relationship
that went beyond competition and I wanted to offer these benefits to a larger
audience. 
I established the Saddle Light Center
in San Antonio Texas and later reopened the HOPE Equestrian Center in the Rogue
Valley.  I worked with at-risk teens in a summer program which showed them
how the trials and tribulations of their lives were in actuality the
whisperings of their destiny calling them on their own hero’s journey.  I
wrote a book about it: Riding Into Your Mythic Life: Transformational
Adventures with the Horse. 
For the past ten years I have taught
Journey Horse, here and in Australia, which are modern day vision quests with
horses, as well as other seminars for professionals in equine assisted
activities and therapies. About a year ago I began to yearn to offer something
of my work to my home community here in the Rogue Valley.
Last spring I was presenting my work
at Prescott Best Practices conference and I heard about a remarkable program in
southern California established 7 years ago.  There was a bit of magic
about it, because I met Catherine Hand briefly when we sat next to one another
at the opening address. She invited me to her presentation, which I probably
would have missed otherwise. At the presentation she told how seven years ago
she was in hospice, dying of damage to her heart and lungs from her radiation
treatment for breast cancer. She had given away her dogs and all but one of her
horses.  One day, she said, she read a book Riding Into Your Mythic Life
and was inspired. It occurred to her that perhaps the story handed her by the
medical profession did not need to be her own story.  (She commented that
the author of that book was somewhere at the conference and to everyone’s
delight I let her know right then that we had already met.)  That day
seven years ago, with the help of a friend she felt inspired to climb onto the
back of her one remaining horse and lay down on the horse’s rump.  Two
days later a hospice nurse asked her what she was doing to be getting better.
 Her rapid heart rate had improved and her oxygenation levels had
increased.  It took her a while to remember that the only thing she’d done
different was to climb on that horse’s back.  After that, she partnered
with a medical professional and pursued her insight, and over the next weeks
she left hospice care, and within the next year she got well and proceeded to
establish the program that she offers in southern California. 
I came home from Arizona inspired to
offer Riding Beyond to my own community. Over 60 people pitched in, helping in
so many different ways.   People and a horse got trained, we gathered or
constructed the equipment we needed, and then we conducted the pilot program in
September. 
PARTICIPANTS IN THE PILOT PROGRAM
SAID
""I came to Riding Beyond with only
the expectation that I would get to know a tiny bit about horses and maybe find
some small happiness for the moment. 
I’d gone through a very difficult
year – a diagnosis of cancer and the loss of my beloved youngest daughter. Joy
was hard to come by. Grief was an every day companion. . . 
I went to the first day of the
program with pretty much no idea whether I’d get bucked off a frisky horse or
have a spontaneous healing like ones I’d heard about. Trish had explained the
program, but with my extremely limited exposure to horses I don’t think
anything really gelled. Well, I was in for one of the most treasured and
healing experiences I’ve had in this rocky road of life. This would be a
healing of the heart.
Mystic’s calm, quiet presence quickly
infused me, and I found myself really falling in love with something in her
that was tangibly intangible. 
I found in the following weeks of the
program that I was constantly bringing up her image in my mind when I felt
stressed or sad or even happy. Just the thought of her would calm my mind and
bring a feeling of contentment, peace, wellbeing. On one occasion I was feeling
some deep angst and restlessness and couldn’t really put my finger on the
cause. I then thought of Mystic, almost automatically, like some people reach
for a sedative. Immediately a huge, huge wave of grief enveloped me. The
release was like the wave of a tsunami and the minutes after were like floating
in an endless quiet sea.
Another time I was praying and
meditating but thoughts kept racing in and out, and grief and sadness and
confusion kept tormenting me. Again my mind automatically went to Mystic and
very surprisingly, in an instant, I became profoundly calm, very quiet, at
peace. Well, I didn’t know what to think of that but hey, I’d take it. And so
went the love affair with the horse, Mystic. I am so grateful.”
“I really appreciate the opportunity
that I had to participate in the pilot program for Riding Beyond.  Each
time I left the ranch after these sessions, I had such a feeling of peace and
well-being (it reminded me that I could feel that way!).  The sessions
included time to share experiences and poems.  The whole team participated
in these discussions which resulted in some interesting conversations and ideas
that I had not thought of previously.
In addition to the health/mind
benefits, this experience helped me to overcome my fear of horses.  Trish
and the volunteers shared their knowledge of horses and were there the entire
time – so I felt safe.  And, of course, the star of the show, Mystic, is
an amazing horse.  She is calm, sweet, and patient.  I enjoyed the
time I spent with Mystic and am now looking forward to taking horseback riding
lessons!
It was an extremely positive
experience that I would highly recommend to others.”
SEVEN MONTHS LATER
“The program
ended but Mystic is a permanent fixture in my life, coming to me in moments of
stress and of joy. I had no idea a horse could do that, no idea. It has
supported me through my ongoing treatment: Mystic is a huge piece of my
well-being. So much had been wiped away by my diagnosis and the death of my
daughter, so many of my assumptions of what life was supposed to be were gone.
Maybe because of that I was able to take what she had to give. I always thought
of horses as big and scary, and I found when I was with her, who she was came
out, a giant presence of love and sweetness. It came into me as someone who
walks beside you when you walk through these kinds of times. It's a pure
relationship without all the baggage with people. She really fills me up.”
VOLUNTEERS SAID
“The individual details of our
stories, we did not share. We did not need to know. By sensing together we
created a place to cultivate reverence, awe, grace, dignity and respect. The
courage to walk with horses, not knowing and being vulnerable, allowed us to
weave together our own story, one of deep connection and belonging. Whether you
are a volunteer or participant, the wisdom and magic of horses exists for you.
Allow it and it will change your life. I am Jenny, a Riding Beyond volunteer
and because I dared to be a part of Riding Beyond, I have grown. Thank you,
Riding Beyond volunteers, participants, and of course the horses. Your courage
has given me great joy.” — Jen Lieber
“Immediately I was awed by the
spirits of the other volunteers, all from different backgrounds  and
experiences yet I felt at home right away. My gifts were acknowledged,
appreciated and cared for. Each person was  assigned a place to be of help
within their comfort level,  no matter their experience with horses or
cancer for that matter. People and animals were held with gentleness, grace and
appreciation. Laughter rang out, a few tears ran down cheeks, warmth exploded
out of our space, (in spite of one very icy Ashland day), chickens cheered us
on and I even got hugged by a horse. What a way to spend a morning. Then we had
the blessing of meeting the participants , brave woman finishing a tough course
of treatment and trusting us to help them take a new step on their journey of
healing. An intuitive horse partner, a trained facilitator and amazing
volunteers. We got to watch the magic unfold. It really doesn’t get any
better. Join us and be inspired.
I can also add: since I am a breast
cancer survivor, I inadvertently received a healing blessing from Mystic, who
took time to get to know me and nuzzled her nose on the exact area I first
found my lump….how’s that for intuitive? She then proceeded to give me a horse
hug , gently wrapping her beautiful neck around my leg and holding me. Guess
she knew we all need love.” —Mary Piper
LARGER MATTERS
Although I have not personally
experienced breast cancer, I have accompanied several friends through their own
treatment, and I have witnessed first-hand the suffering and courage that is
required by women who take this journey.  It is life-changing, challenging
their most intimate sense of self and personal identity. My friends were huge
inspirations to me. 
I believe that women who face breast
cancer are ambassadors of the rise of the feminine in the evolutionary process
that we are all participating in, not the rise of feminism, but the rise of the
unique qualities of the feminine soul for nurturing life and finding
life-giving solutions to problems instead of resorting to warfare and violence.
They have the potential to be those who can pioneer a new way, having gone
through a fire that hones their purpose to laser clarity. 
To have breast cancer is
intrinsically involved in what it takes to overcome enormous challenges, and to
gather resources to separate one's identity as a person from the disease at an
intimate level, to find who they are as strong and creative beings. Breast cancer
can strike at their most intimate sense of self and personal identity. Riding
Beyond offers an experience of their core selves as creative and strong,
keeping them in touch with creativity and strength so that they can claim their
personal possibilities for this larger destiny. They are a keystone species
critical to the unfolding of something new and life-sustaining for our world’s
long-term future. 
DEDICATION
This work is dedicated to those
friends of mine who have met the cancer challenge and other women like them around the world.  
It is also dedicated to the
remarkable horses who have demonstrated their willingness,
wisdom and enthusiasm for engaging with humans for such elegant and effective
healing purposes. 
Along the lines of dedicating this
work, I will be attending a Sundance at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South
Dakota for the summer solstice. Although I have been invited to this sundance
for many years, this is the first time that I feel compelled to attend. It is
held at a wild horse sanctuary, and I intend that four days of dancing and
fasting and praying will anchor and launch the future of Riding Beyond, as well
as benefit our wider stewardship of the earth. 
I believe in the power of the horse
human connection because it’s this kind of bridging between species, partnering
with horses in this case, that is a critical practice for the survival of our
world, a world  where so many bridges between peoples and between us and
our planet desperately need to be forged. 
With our horses, it means making
performance goals secondary to relationship goals, so that winning a blue
ribbon is not nearly so important as being able to listen deeply to the
language of a horse, learning their language and involving  them in our
deep and ongoing life journeys as a teacher and companion.  With our
fellow human beings, it leads us to new ways of living and being, bringing
balance to our lives for healing, finding new ways of leadership that are
essentially collaborative, and implementing what we know about our all being
connected as one world on planet Earth. 

Horses
are associated in our imaginations with grand tales of heroism and adventure,
large movement and beauty. This is their mythic aspect. And by engaging with
horses from that perspective, they introduce us to our own mythic lives and
keep us connected to it, that larger life that we so easily can loose sight of,
the life that’s possible for us.  By pursuing that relationship with a
horse, we can go forth, you might say ride forth into that larger life.  Other Ways You Can Help
