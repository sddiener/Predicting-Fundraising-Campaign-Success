<p>How it all got started: The story of the first poolbot. Our Founder, Heinrich, tells this story.</p>
<p><i>“Born out of sheer frustration and annoyance, the first Poolbot was assembled in late 2016… My brother and I, both electronic engineers had had enough of endless pool testing kits, tons of money spent on chemicals, pool gadgets and swampy water. So we put our minds together to dream up a device that would forever change the way we maintain our pools.</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546612993/tr72mi6olw8ngdfywkmj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>We wanted an easy, affordable, no-nonsense device that would take the guess work out of having a clear, healthy pool and it also had to have an easy-to-use app so that we could maintain it from anywhere in the world. Primitive market research among friends, family and the local pool shop proved we weren’t the only ones feeling the frustration and soon we had more requests for devices than we could keep up with.</i></p>

<p><i>And so the first Poolbot was tossed into a murky, green pool in early 2017 and with lots of late nights, tweaking and calibrating the first pool turned from green to clean! What we started with was a bunch of electronics and some kitty litter in a floating lunch box, but it worked and that got us noticed by Sqwidnet – and airport security a few times!”</i></p>

<p>The Innovation Hub shared our excitement when we were announced as one of the winners of the prestigious GAP ICT Awards in late 2017. We partnered with Sqwidnet (who provides the IoT network we use) and then we started to really gain some momentum.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Since then we successfully raised further grant and private funding and have been refining our prototypes to work out any remaining snags. We have had tremendous success with keeping numerous pools in pristine condition and we look forward to the next stage in our journey with you as our partners in our fight against swampy pools and frustrating test kits.</p>

<p><i>Above: Then vs. Now. Our prototype electronics (above) fully industrialized onto a single, small board (below) ready for full scale production.</i></p>

Do you shave?2. Do you like to save money?3. Have you ever experienced razor burn, irritation or an uncomfortable shave?If you answered YES to any, or all, of them than you need to see this!Leaf combines amazing, time-tested blades with modern shaving ergonomics so that you can stop renting your shave and OWN your shave.This is the razor that changes shaving forever. 
 We designed Leaf because we were tired of paying the Big Shave companies. And paying Shave Clubs for the same disposable razors wasn't much better.So we took it upon ourselves to innovate the product and break the blade-and-razor strategy. And we're incredibly excited to announce the Leaf Razor, the product of more than a year of design, iteration, testing and refinement!This is really simple, there's a better way to get a great shave for a fraction of the cost of disposable razors. But you don't have to give up on the modern conveniences of a comfortable pivoting head and multiple blades. The Leaf Razor is the best shave we've ever had, hands down. The Leaf Razor is an all-metal, beautifully designed razor handle that integrates double-edge razor blades into a modern form factor. With a pivoting head and multiple-blades. We've created a razor that can compete head-to-head with the most advanced razors in the world, while allowing our customers to replace their blades for CENTS not dollars.The Leaf Razor has unique technology to adjust aggressiveness that can't be found in any other cartridge shaving system! The Leaf Razor can hold 1, 2 or 3 blades where each blade position has a different level of aggressiveness engineered via blade exposure. This means that you can adjust the aggressiveness of the shave whenever you want.It might sound like a paradox to suggest that our solution is both cheaper to use, and introduces new features to give you a better shave...But it's true. Experience the convenience of LeafWhat do we mean by convenience? Well, 200 blades for Leaf fit in the same footprint as 4 traditional cartridges. That's incredible!It also means that replacement blades are always there when you need them.You don't need to keep using old, worn-out, cartridges just because you forgot a trip to the store, or because the UPS guy hasn't shown up yet.The Leaf Razor is not a shave club - because we believe that you need to OWN your shave, not RENT your shave. Watch how to load the Leaf Razor!HOW ARE THE BLADES SO CHEAP? Leaf uses 1/2 of any standard Double-Edge (DE) blade. There are dozens of options easily available at pharmacies or online (e.g. Amazon), including the Leaf preferred blade which will be supplied on our website after campaign close, and with each of our pledge levels. This is a DE bladeThis is how you snap a DE blade into two halves within it's existing packaging. Easy!Each of these blade edges costs as little as 5 cents per piece. So count it out with us... Tapered Exposure SystemTapered Exposure is what we call our proprietary tapering of the blade aggressiveness. Check out the diagram below - it shows examples of what you can achieve when you have the flexibility to place each blade individually! One might use the most aggressive position to remove hair with the grain, but disengage the first blade (check out the third configuration from the left) and shave against the grain with a less aggressive, comfortable, shave. 
 

      First, we designed for function...Shaving razors involve putting a blade to your skin and dragging it along, balancing comfort, cutting ability, blade longevity, aggressiveness and speed among many factors. Our early prototyping focused on getting the razor head portion right, including adjusting blade exposure and position, gap, angle-of-attack, and mounting. Throughout these early iterations we not only learned how to control these factors, but how to manage other important features like fluid flow through the design. We kept our eyes on how each design iteration affected rinse-ability, especially as we started stacking in first two, then three blades through our proprietary technology. Because we are both engineers, our ability to quickly iterate and hone in on the right design while balancing the myriad of features that are important for a shaving razor allowed us to create the Leaf Razor. Then, we designed for form.We knew that we could make a quality razor that delivered the experience we envisioned at the start of this project.Leaf is designed to be shown.

Overtime, we will build a beautiful deck around the new pool. The current pool deck will be restored creating more outdoor space to be used for workshops, yoga, dining, and more. Moving the pool away from the main lodge also means that fun pool time can happen all day without disturbing workshops taking place in the Great Room. This improvement will have a huge impact on what Easton has to offer, and we'll get to enjoy it all summer long, and beyond!",0.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<h1><strong>Customize Your Pillow for a perfect night’s sleep. It's as easy as turning three dials.</strong></h1>
<p>The P3 will change the way people think about pillows. Our user testing has shown that people on the P3 have reduced neck pain, increased sleep duration and quality and improved day time arousal. The P3 treats you whilst you sleep.</p>
We strove to create an ideal solution in a simple, comfortable pillow which will suit nearly all users (99.5%) whilst conforming to current linen sizes so that it seamlessly blends into your current sleeping environment. It is a unique, custom fitted pillow system that supports and facilitates an optimal sleep.
<div> </div>

<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/286/275/cf59fb2f8dd213084ef5dc156ef8fd5d_large.jpg?1354274140"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>
<h1>Adjust It.</h1>
<p>With an inner adjustable orthotic device and a quality external foam pillow shell, the P3 pillow is both practical and comfortable. The orthotic has three adjustable sections. Two with 2.75""  (70mm) adjustment and one with 2""(50mm). It uses three BOA dials for micro adjustability. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/286/267/539ff239ad7cc1f91f6afefe84860df1_large.jpg?1354273694"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The P3 pillow can be adjusted by a health professional or by the user to ensure the correct height/posture for both side lying and supine sleeping. </p>
<p>Every P3 pillow comes with a quick installation guide and a measuring tool so that your P3 can be set to your optimal sleeping position(s).</p>
<p>The P3’s unique design also facilitates rolling from supine to side lying via a winged angle (30°). This reduces the “shoulder lift and roll” required for posture transition seen by most sleepers.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/286/233/ad0eef420a1e99f9dffb76787fe2a50c_large.gif?1354271639"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>With the average height required for back sleeping 3.1"" (80 mm), and the average height required for side-sleeping 4.3"" (110mm), (plus height variations) it was essential to develop a pillow that could support the neck in three main sleep positions. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/254/973/1fa4ed4325affb0bc9d8b2225d8f8bad_large.png?1352586416"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p><em>Figure above shows an end a cross sectional view of how the pillow increases height.</em> </p>
<p>Unlike single-height pillows currently in the marketplace, the adjustable P3 pillow becomes integrated with each individual, to ensure a restful and pain-reduced sleep. The P3 has been supported through x-ray testing and user trials. It stands out as a leader in the ability to provide a tailored therapeutic sleep solution. The developers of the P3 pillow have partnered with leading manufacturers and design engineers to bring you a pillow revolution.  </p>
<h1>Tested… so you don’t need to</h1>
<p>We have been developing and testing the P3 since 2009. The idea came from the founders, experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapists/physical therapists. Every day health practitioners like us treat spinal conditions and we are asked for pillow and bed recommendation. It was frustrating that the pillow market did not offer a suitable pillow which we could confidently recommend.  </p>
<p>Our market research supports this-</p>
<ul>
<li>86.6% of people would prefer recommendation and pillow fitting by a health professional</li>
<li>79.2% people surveyed do not feel that they get adequate support by their pillow.</li>
<li>78.8% of people experience some form of neck discomfort at least once per month and 16.9% will have daily/nightly pain whilst in bed. <a href=""http://file///Y:/BD/BD%20ideas/BD%20ideas/pillow/kickstarter/written%20info.docx#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">[1]</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>User trials and radiological measurements have shown the P3 pillow can be prescribed to significantly assist people with neck pain or sleep issues. Our trial showed a 28.5% reduction in sleep issues on a modified Pittsburgh sleep questionnaire along with improved daytime alertness and increased sleep quality and a statistically significant decrease in neck pain after using the P3 for seven days. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/286/274/de036eba4afae1622287702b82a2a281_large.jpg?1354274097"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The shell and foam structure was designed using a 5000-person dataset to ensure most body shapes and sizes were catered for. Our pillow suits 99.5% of body shapes.</p>
<p>By combining the accuracy of a health professional's understanding of their clients’ needs with the technology of the P3’s inner orthotic and foam properties, we can now offer an ideal sleep solution. Recent research has shown that normal therapeutic contour pillows do not significantly improve neck/spinal position in side lying (Gordon et al, Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2011:4 321–327). The P3 pillow adjusts height rather than contour, which is shown on x-ray analysis to deliver posture changes. All it takes is three measurements, and three turns of the dials, and approximately three minutes to tailor each P3 pillow to its user’s requirements. </p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>The inner shell of the P3 Pillow incorporates a state-of-the-art dial system supplied by BOA Technologies. This innovation provides continually variable tensioning control, which ensures all adjustments can be made quickly and easily. </p>
<p>The dial system is integrated with a measurement tool which is supplied with the pillow to ensure an accurate prescription. The adjustment height has a range of 3.14"" (70 mm) in three separate zones: base, and each wing section. Each of the straps can sustain 176lbs (80kg) of pressure (head weight is 11lbs). To adjust the height one simply tensions the dial to the corresponding numbers on the prescription tool provided. The P3 has in built stabilising bars to stop any under-surface rocking.</p>

<p><em> “I </em><em>wanted to give you some feedback on your pillow that I have been sleeping on now for several months. Before I started using your pillow I was suffering from a severe lack of sleep, waking several times throughout the night and having extreme trouble getting back to sleep, usually averaging about three to four hours of sleep throughout the night. I also suffered from neck pain and headaches. This is something I have been enduring for more years than I would like to count. Over the years I have tried numerous types of pillows with varying degrees of help. I am now happy to say that my sleep pattern has improved considerably and I now average six to eight hours sleep a night, and when I do wake throughout the night I generally have no trouble getting back to sleep. My neck pain and headaches have greatly reduced and I do not remember the last time I woke up with neck pain. I would not hesitate to recommend this pillow to anyone, and in fact have told many friends and associates about it.""  Megan</em></p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Q. How do I know how high to make the pillow in each position?    A.</strong>  We supply you with a 6 step guide to setting the pillow. It will take less than 3 minutes. It is best to have someone else there just to take your measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How long does will the pillow last?    A. </strong>The orthotic inner shell will last in excess of 10 years. The foam can show some compression with time and, as with all foam pillows, we suggest you change them every few years. We have developed replacement foam which can be purchased.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What dials are you using?    A. </strong>We are using BOA dials which are seen in all the high end outdoor wear such as snowboarding boots, cycling shoes. BOA has refined dial technology and we worked in conjunction with their product engineers. The dials will have a lifetime guarantee and can be easily replaced in the event of one malfunctioning.</p>
<p><strong>Q. I sleep on my stomach, is the P3 suitable?    A. </strong>Sleeping on your stomach is not a recommended position. Usually if someone sleeps the entire night on their stomach only it is recommended that they use either a very low pillow or no pillow at all. The P3 can be set for super low</p>
<p><strong>Q. What if I change mattresses or move between beds?    A. </strong>Yes, great question. If you change your sleeping surface it will sometimes alter the depth your shoulder drops down- because you don’t need to take the shell out of the pillow and the dials are easy to access we recommend fine tuning the dials to get maximal comfort. Our recommendation with the measuring tool is the starting position for a medium firmness bed- it may take one or two little tweaks of the dial to get your ideal position if you have a very hard or soft mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Q. I see a Chiropractor, Osteopath or Physical Therapist for my neck can they help?    A. </strong>We have an online training accreditation system for health professionals to guide them through the advanced configuration of the P3. Direct your health professional to our website and they can undertake the eLearning module. After completing this they are accredited in the fitting and supply of the P3. We will link them to our website as “preferred fitters”</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I replace the outer foam?</strong> <strong>A.</strong> Yes, it is recommended to change the foam every 2- 3 years to keep the P3 as supportive and as comfortable. The foam can be purchased online or through health accredited health care providers.</p>

<p><b>Our story and desire to light Africa</b></p>
<p>When LightSeed Energy co-founder Michael Pietrzak was working in a refugee camp in Malawi five years ago, he was invited into a man's home to talk about a problem that he was having. Something from that meeting stayed with him: Michael was sitting five feet from his host and could not see his face, even though it was the middle of the day. Michael could only imagine how dark it would get at night, and how difficult his own life would be without light.</p>
<p><b>After doing some research, Michael found that 85% of Africans have no access to electricity, creating major health, economic and environmental problems.</b></p>
<p>The results? Read it for yourself:</p>
<p>1) 400,000 Africans die prematurely each year due to indoor air pollution caused by traditional fuels like kerosene and charcoal.</p>
<p>2) Those without electricity spend up to 30% of their income on traditional fuels like kerosene and charcoal.</p>
<p>3) Traditional fuels contribute to climate change and deforestation, affecting all of us on our fragile planet.</p>
<p>Michael decided to do something and that is when LightSeed Energy was born. LightSeed Energy provides solar systems to families in Africa without access to the electrical grid.</p>
<p><b>Supplying families with solar energy in Africa has proven benefits.</b></p>
<p>1) The use of solar lamps reduces indoor and environmental pollution significantly.</p>
<p>2) Solar energy is cheaper to obtain and maintain, helping families own affordable solar lighting and increase their household income by as much as 50%.</p>
<p>3) Solar light allows children to study safely, helping them improve grades and giving them more opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Be part of the change.</b></p>
<p>Your donation will provide students the opportunity to study at night with a healthier and more sustainable solar lamp.</p>
<p><b>The cost to purchase and distribute each solar lamp is $10, so your $30 contribution can light up a family’s home.</b></p>
<p>But it does not stop here. This first project is only the beginning of a global energy revolution. Our goal is to eradicate energy poverty in Africa by 2030, by placing solar energy in the hands of every African without access to electricity.</p>
<p><b>The details</b></p>
<p>Minus the $3,000 that was required to film our crowfunding video and Indiegogo's fees, all of the money raised from this campaign will go towards purchasing and distribution of solar lamps to students in Zambia. LightSeed Energy co-founders plan to fly to Zambia in April 2014 to distribute all solar lamps to the students in need (paying for their own flights, expenses and accommodations).</p>
<p>The solar lamp in question is the d.light S2 – a solar powered lamp that will last for five years on average. (<a href=""http://www.dlightdesign.com/productline/s2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>http://www.dlightdesign.com/productline/s2/</b></a>)</p>
<p>At LightSeed Energy, we want you to be a part of the global movement to eradicate energy poverty. Check out our perks list on the right that will engage you and help you interact with the Zambian communities that we are helping.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are a two man very complementary team(more information about us <a href=""http://www.wemih.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wemih.com</a>), with business, startups and software backgrounds and a mesmerizing energy. We speak German, French, English and Italian. We believe in what we do, and we know that will be something big. Be part of the history and let's together give a run to innovation. The product is supposed to be rolled out worldwide, every where we have corporates with a wide-spread impact and parallel entry points. We want to launch first in Europe, then in the USA. Our prototype will be our proof-of-concept. We know that our future customers would be willing to move due to the huge financial benefit and our better approaches. We look forward to create jobs in developing countries for people with an university degree and without position. We are proud to say that our solution is eco-friendly. That was an important point for us, due to its upcoming worldwide expansion. Our solution uses simple, common means to solve nowadays complex problems. We also focused on the reusability by implementing our solution. Have a look on our demonstrator on <a href=""http://www.getaco.itascha.org/reporter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.itascha.org/reporter</a> to experience the functionalities of our product and just contact us if you have questions. We'll explain that functionalities in upcoming threads. Please be aware that the application will be sometimes not available, for a short time, due to new deployments. We need 2.000€ for a minimal prototype, on the most common cash register types. The bigger the sum we raise, the more complex and more general is our prototype. Our prototype will simulate the communication between cash registers and smart phones.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding goal</h3>
<p>With the 2.000€ we would like to raise, we aim to buy common cash registers within the food trade area in Europe and simulate our smart phone application with them. According to our business strategy we'll start focusing on a single business area and roll out over the other areas step by step. We'll start with the food area because our solution here would be easier to implement and also because of the very big number of potential customers. That prototype should also test the main cash registers on supermarkets. That common registers has a Linux operating system (e.g. Genivi) which doesn't requires a big RAM and without devices manager, an Oracle data base or an embedded Sqlite data base, no SSD, no SATA, cheap hardware components. It may be also that we have to buy specific accessories for specific smart phones or specific cash registers. Per default we plan to use the ones delivered by the smart phone or the registers manufacturer.</p>
<p>Please be aware on the amazing perks!.</p>
<p>If we can't raise the 2.000€, then we'll first iterate and check what's going wrong in our concept. After that we'll use the money we raised to get involved (travel costs, etc).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We are interested on feedbacks and interesting threads</h3>
<p>By means that blog, we are not only interested on raising money to start to implement our prototype. We also have a huge focus on the big Indiegogo community and the firsts feedback we'll become from it. Our project is a general concept and it's fine tuned for specific use cases, which are mostly market specific. The worldwide Indiegogo community could help us checking if we didn't forgot specific use cases, for specific markets. Furthermore discussing about common use cases and our related approachs would also help us may be to better iterate and the world to become the best possible product </p>

<h3><span>Meet Roccbox - the easy to use, 930°F (500°C) oven that cooks restaurant quality pizza in just 90 seconds and so much more.</span></h3>

<p> </p>
<p>Roccbox is a portable, lightweight, wood and gas fired stone floor oven. It cooks beautiful Neapolitan pizza in under 90 seconds as well as an unlimited number of your favourite meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Until now, wood fired ovens have only been accessible to those with a big budget and permanent, outdoor space. Roccbox solves these problems and brings authentic wood and gas fired cooking to everybody. Take Roccbox with you camping, to the forest, on the beach or use it in your back garden. You’ll be able to achieve unbeatable cooking results anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Wood fired cooking is all about excitement, theatre and amazing flavour.  There is a reason why artisan 'stone bake' restaurants are on the rise! It is a creative and addictive way to share social time with friends and family and we believe that once you taste the results, it’ll change the way you cook and socialise forever.</p>

<h3>Smaller &amp; more affordable than <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">a full-size oven, without any compromise on speed or power.</span>
</h3>
<div><p> </p></div>
<p>Traditional stone floor ovens are large, heavy and take a long time to heat up. They are also pretty expensive which means that most people don’t get to enjoy the incredible food they create.</p>
<p>Roccbox is powerful enough to reach up to 930<b>°</b>F (500<b>°</b>C) in as little as 15 minutes. It is small enough to transport and comes with both a wood and gas burner so you can choose which style of authentic high-heat cooking suits you.</p> <p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>A word from Roccbox’s founder...</b></h3>
<div>""I wanted to take the hard work out of wood fired cooking. Making it possible for anyone to own a stone bake oven with even the smallest outdoor space <i>and</i> a limited budget has been a dream of mine since I started The Stone Bake Oven Company 6 years ago.</div>
<p>My commercial wood and gas fired oven business, Gozney Ovens is the UK’s market leader. Seeing the unbeatable results produced from my commercial ovens when using the highest quality, commercial-grade materials meant that nothing was compromised during the design and manufacturing of Roccbox.  The cooking results rival that of my commercial ovens without a doubt!""</p>

</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>Once you have mastered the art of 90 second Neapolitan pizza, you’ll probably want to explore Roccbox’s versatility. Whether roasting vegetables, caramelising meat or crisping up fish and fluffy breads, Roccbox will leave you with a completely unforgettable taste experience.</p>
<p>The real magic is in the finishing. In Roccbox, you have the ability to cook at temperatures much higher than a conventional oven and this is the key to the unique textures and flavours you'll now be able to create at home. We think that these unbeatable results are the reason that anyone who tries the food produced falls in love with Roccbox instantly.</p>

<p>A temperature of 930°F  (500°C) is required in order to achieve the optimum pizza cooking environment. Roccbox’s porous stone floor crisps up the pizza from the base up whilst the rolling flame cooks the pizza top down resulting in an exceptionally quick and evenly cooked pizza.</p>
<p>The mark of a true Neapolitan pizza is the speed it is cooked. In Roccbox, it takes about 90 seconds to achieve. All you need to do is rotate your pizza a couple of times throughout to ensure a thoroughly even cook.</p>

<p>Fish and seafood dishes cook beautifully and effortlessly in Roccbox. The intensely dry heat will cook your fish dishes through in no time whilst locking in moisture, keeping the fish succulent. But it is the perfectly crisp skin that really steals the show - achieved in a way that no conventional oven ever could! Dishes such as garlic king prawns and hot smoked salmon can be produced within minutes, the rolling flame licking the food leaving behind a mouth-watering, unique flavour.</p>

<p>Crispy crackling, tender, juicy steaks and deliciously caramelised roasting joints can all be achieved simply and easily in Roccbox. Cook perfect steaks every time on a cast iron griddle pan. The high heat will brown and caramelise the exterior of the steak whilst it cooks through to your preference. You can also reduce the heat a little lower to roast your meat over a longer period of time for dishes such as aromatic, herb-infused spatchcock chicken. Just don’t forget to whack up the heat for the last few minutes to crisp up that beautifully herby, oily skin – you’ll never want to roast in your conventional oven ever again!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Roccbox’s porous stone floor lends itself perfectly to baking breads, ensuring a perfectly crisp crust every time. Ideal for creating flatbreads out of your leftover pizza dough or favourite artisan recipe, the high heat cooking environment means your dough will rise to beautifully fluffy loaves within seconds, not forgetting the delicious charring and spotting that is only achievable by authentic stone baking. Use Roccbox at a lower temperature to bake your flatbreads, remove from the oven and stuff with your favourite cheeses and cured meats. Place back in the oven to toast and melt down for a mouth-watering, stone baked, deli style sandwich - you’ll never want to buy a shop bought snack ever again!</p>

<p>The intense cooking environment of Roccbox is ideal for crafting impossibly tasty vegetable dishes. Soft and sticky sweet potato wedges, crisp and caramelised Mediterranean vegetables and deliciously seared asparagus are all incredibly quick and simple to execute. The high heat environment will rapidly cook the food through whilst the rolling flame will catch the edges of your vegetables leaving behind the crispy charring that make roasted vegetable dishes irresistible.  </p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.roccbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Heat-Flow-1.gif"" src=""""/><div>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether using wood or gas, the burner attaches to the underside of Roccbox's body. Once it is lit, all of the thermal elements (dome insulation, stone floor and under floor insulation deck) begin to store and radiate heat, saturating it evenly throughout the oven. This creates a unique, consistent cooking environment closely mirroring that of a traditional stone bake oven. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>This all sounds great, but is it safe?</b></h3>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p> The Roccbox team have an extensive background in commercial oven design and engineering and we take safety extremely seriously. Cooking in Roccbox is a unique style of cooking but is very safe and you’ll have it mastered in no time. Our comprehensive user manual will cover the dos and don’ts and absolutely everything in between from safely firing up the oven, to handling the oven after use. We have worked exceptionally hard and have taken considerable care to ensure that Roccbox is as safe to use as any BBQ you’ll find on the market! We will of course meet all the relevant safety standards and certifications in each country that we ship to<b>. </b></p>

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>Portability is key issue with traditional stone ovens. Yet the reason they work so well is down to their thermal mass (which equates to weight). We knew therefore that Roccbox had to be balanced carefully in order to achieve its mission. Dense enough to work effectively but light enough for one person to carry. After almost 100 material and composition variations, we've got it just right. The handy carry strap we have designed means that lifting Roccbox out of its box is a breeze and at just 20kg, Roccbox can be carried short distances single handedly ready to pop up wherever you chose!</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Roccbox is portable, lightweight and compact resulting in ultimate convenience. However, all of these features would be wasted if it took too long for the oven to get up to cooking temperature. Unlike a conventional BBQ where you may have to wait in excess of an hour, Roccbox will reach the optimum pizza cooking temperature of 930°F (500°c) in as little as 15 minutes. Whether you are cooking with uber convenient gas or going for a totally traditional wood fired cook, with as little as 15 minutes to wait you’ll have more time to concentrate on socialising with family and friends and eating great food, which is what Roccbox is all about!</span></p>

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Includes 2 burners: wood &amp; gas.</b></span></h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Originally, both burners were going to be sold as separate products. However, during the testing stages of Roccbox, we soon realised that both wood and gas offer a unique cooking experience that everyone should be able to experience right out of the box. All customers will receive both a wood and a gas burner, with hose.</span></p>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Gas Burner</span></h4> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.roccbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gas.jpg"" src=""""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Roccbox’s gas burner was a challenging component to get right. Although skilfully designed, it is the more simplistic of the two burners in terms of operational use and maintenance. You simply can't beat the consistency or convenience of a constant, regulated flame when optimising an environment for cooking Simply turn the gas burner on and adjust the temperature to suit your cooking style.</span></p>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wood Burner</span></h4> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.roccbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wood.jpg"" src=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Roccbox’s wood burner is an engineering masterpiece and was the most challenging part of creating Roccbox. The wood burner is constructed of three layers of stainless steel, the outer most layer being perforated to prevent intense heat build up. The entire burner has been designed to draw air through its body, creating an intense flame with a secondary combustion that has all the power of a mini jet flame without the need of a power sourceIt really is a pretty cool piece of engineering!</span></p>
<p>Using the wood burner is a much more traditional process, but a uniquely rewarding one. Roccbox wouldn't be true to its roots without a sustainable fuel option and we think the authentic flavour that wood fired cooking brings to all dishes is more than worth the effort. Kiln dried, hardwood kindling is our recommended fuel of choice and you can even experiment with different wood types to achieve variations in flavour.</p>

<h4> </h4> <h4>Commercial Grade Pizza Peel</h4>

<div>
<p>The Roccbox pizza peel was designed to be ergonomic, lightweight, beautiful and functional. It is made from pressed aluminium and has tapered edges to ensure smooth transitions as your pizza is moved from its preparation surface to peel, from peel into the oven. The perforations in the peel allow for any excess flour to escape before placing the pizza into the oven because burnt flour on the underside of your pizza tastes bad and looks even worse! </p>

<h4> </h4> <h4>Stone Cooking Floor</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.roccbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stone-floor.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div>Getting the stone floor right was crucial to the success of Roccbox. We went through countless variations to get the right balance of density and porosity to ensure the stone performed excellently and created delicious pizza.  Once saturated with heat, Roccbox's cordierite stone absorbs moisture whilst cooking from the bottom up, creating the signature leopard spotted bases associated with an authentic Neapolitan style pizza.</div>

</div></div>","Meet Roccbox - the easy to use, 930°F (500°C) oven that cooks restaurant quality pizza in just 90 seconds and so much more.


 
Roccbox is a portable, lightweight, wood and gas fired stone floor oven. It cooks beautiful Neapolitan pizza in under 90 seconds as well as an unlimited number of your favourite meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Until now, wood fired ovens have only been accessible to those with a big budget and permanent, outdoor space. Roccbox solves these problems and brings authentic wood and gas fired cooking to everybody. Take Roccbox with you camping, to the forest, on the beach or use it in your back garden. You’ll be able to achieve unbeatable cooking results anytime, anywhere.
Wood fired cooking is all about excitement, theatre and amazing flavour.  There is a reason why artisan 'stone bake' restaurants are on the rise! It is a creative and addictive way to share social time with friends and family and we believe that once you taste the results, it’ll change the way you cook and socialise forever.
 

Smaller & more affordable than a full-size oven, without any compromise on speed or power.

 
Traditional stone floor ovens are large, heavy and take a long time to heat up. They are also pretty expensive which means that most people don’t get to enjoy the incredible food they create.
Roccbox is powerful enough to reach up to 930°F (500°C) in as little as 15 minutes. It is small enough to transport and comes with both a wood and gas burner so you can choose which style of authentic high-heat cooking suits you.  
 
A word from Roccbox’s founder...
""I wanted to take the hard work out of wood fired cooking. Making it possible for anyone to own a stone bake oven with even the smallest outdoor space and a limited budget has been a dream of mine since I started The Stone Bake Oven Company 6 years ago.
My commercial wood and gas fired oven business, Gozney Ovens is the UK’s market leader. Seeing the unbeatable results produced from my commercial ovens when using the highest quality, commercial-grade materials meant that nothing was compromised during the design and manufacturing of Roccbox.  The cooking results rival that of my commercial ovens without a doubt!""
Tom Gozney – Founder and CEO

 
Roccbox can cook almost anything.


Once you have mastered the art of 90 second Neapolitan pizza, you’ll probably want to explore Roccbox’s versatility. Whether roasting vegetables, caramelising meat or crisping up fish and fluffy breads, Roccbox will leave you with a completely unforgettable taste experience.
The real magic is in the finishing. In Roccbox, you have the ability to cook at temperatures much higher than a conventional oven and this is the key to the unique textures and flavours you'll now be able to create at home. We think that these unbeatable results are the reason that anyone who tries the food produced falls in love with Roccbox instantly.
 
 
 
 
Create authentic, stone baked Neapolitan pizza.
 
 
Originating from Naples in Italy, Neapolitan pizza is regarded the best in the world. It has a super light, fluffy rise with crispy, charred spots and ideally made with a good sourdough.
A temperature of 930°F  (500°C) is required in order to achieve the optimum pizza cooking environment. Roccbox’s porous stone floor crisps up the pizza from the base up whilst the rolling flame cooks the pizza top down resulting in an exceptionally quick and evenly cooked pizza.
The mark of a true Neapolitan pizza is the speed it is cooked. In Roccbox, it takes about 90 seconds to achieve. All you need to do is rotate your pizza a couple of times throughout to ensure a thoroughly even cook.
Don't believe it? Watch Roccbox's founder, Tom cook a 90 second Neapolitan pizza in this one-take video!

Still don't believe it? 
Checkout the 'un-chopped' footage from each camera on Youtube.
 
Blitz fish skin to crisp, crunchy perfection.
 
 


 
Fish and seafood dishes cook beautifully and effortlessly in Roccbox. The intensely dry heat will cook your fish dishes through in no time whilst locking in moisture, keeping the fish succulent. But it is the perfectly crisp skin that really steals the show - achieved in a way that no conventional oven ever could! Dishes such as garlic king prawns and hot smoked salmon can be produced within minutes, the rolling flame licking the food leaving behind a mouth-watering, unique flavour.
 
Beautifully roasted meat dishes.


Crispy crackling, tender, juicy steaks and deliciously caramelised roasting joints can all be achieved simply and easily in Roccbox. Cook perfect steaks every time on a cast iron griddle pan. The high heat will brown and caramelise the exterior of the steak whilst it cooks through to your preference. You can also reduce the heat a little lower to roast your meat over a longer period of time for dishes such as aromatic, herb-infused spatchcock chicken. Just don’t forget to whack up the heat for the last few minutes to crisp up that beautifully herby, oily skin – you’ll never want to roast in your conventional oven ever again!


 
 
Bake impossibly good flatbreads.
 



 
Roccbox’s porous stone floor lends itself perfectly to baking breads, ensuring a perfectly crisp crust every time. Ideal for creating flatbreads out of your leftover pizza dough or favourite artisan recipe, the high heat cooking environment means your dough will rise to beautifully fluffy loaves within seconds, not forgetting the delicious charring and spotting that is only achievable by authentic stone baking. Use Roccbox at a lower temperature to bake your flatbreads, remove from the oven and stuff with your favourite cheeses and cured meats. Place back in the oven to toast and melt down for a mouth-watering, stone baked, deli style sandwich - you’ll never want to buy a shop bought snack ever again!
 
 
Veggies in a flash.
 


 
The intense cooking environment of Roccbox is ideal for crafting impossibly tasty vegetable dishes. Soft and sticky sweet potato wedges, crisp and caramelised Mediterranean vegetables and deliciously seared asparagus are all incredibly quick and simple to execute. The high heat environment will rapidly cook the food through whilst the rolling flame will catch the edges of your vegetables leaving behind the crispy charring that make roasted vegetable dishes irresistible.  
 
 
 
 


How it works?
 

 
Whether using wood or gas, the burner attaches to the underside of Roccbox's body. Once it is lit, all of the thermal elements (dome insulation, stone floor and under floor insulation deck) begin to store and radiate heat, saturating it evenly throughout the oven. This creates a unique, consistent cooking environment closely mirroring that of a traditional stone bake oven. 
 

 
This all sounds great, but is it safe?

 The Roccbox team have an extensive background in commercial oven design and engineering and we take safety extremely seriously. Cooking in Roccbox is a unique style of cooking but is very safe and you’ll have it mastered in no time. Our comprehensive user manual will cover the dos and don’ts and absolutely everything in between from safely firing up the oven, to handling the oven after use. We have worked exceptionally hard and have taken considerable care to ensure that Roccbox is as safe to use as any BBQ you’ll find on the market! We will of course meet all the relevant safety standards and certifications in each country that we ship to. 
 
 
Light enough for one person to carry.

 


Portability is key issue with traditional stone ovens. Yet the reason they work so well is down to their thermal mass (which equates to weight). We knew therefore that Roccbox had to be balanced carefully in order to achieve its mission. Dense enough to work effectively but light enough for one person to carry. After almost 100 material and composition variations, we've got it just right. The handy carry strap we have designed means that lifting Roccbox out of its box is a breeze and at just 20kg, Roccbox can be carried short distances single handedly ready to pop up wherever you chose!
 
 
Heats up to 930°F in as little as 15 minutes. 
 



 
Roccbox is portable, lightweight and compact resulting in ultimate convenience. However, all of these features would be wasted if it took too long for the oven to get up to cooking temperature. Unlike a conventional BBQ where you may have to wait in excess of an hour, Roccbox will reach the optimum pizza cooking temperature of 930°F (500°c) in as little as 15 minutes. Whether you are cooking with uber convenient gas or going for a totally traditional wood fired cook, with as little as 15 minutes to wait you’ll have more time to concentrate on socialising with family and friends and eating great food, which is what Roccbox is all about!



 
 
 
Choose from two stylish colours.
 
Do you like to make a statement and stand out from the crowd? We have no doubt our striking Grass Green Roccbox is the one you’ll choose. It has become our iconic statement colour over the past few years and we know you are going to go crazy for it! If you tend to opt for the slightly understated look and prefer your gadgets a little more sleek and stealth-like, don’t worry we’ve got you covered! Our Stone Grey is simple, dramatic and effortlessly cool.

 
Everything you need to get started is in the box.
 
 

We want everyone who receives a Roccbox to be able to get outside and get cooking as soon as they receive it meaning we have filled the box with absolutely everything you are going to need to get started.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watch Roccbox's founder, Tom explain what's in the box...
 

 
 
Includes 2 burners: wood & gas.
Originally, both burners were going to be sold as separate products. However, during the testing stages of Roccbox, we soon realised that both wood and gas offer a unique cooking experience that everyone should be able to experience right out of the box. All customers will receive both a wood and a gas burner, with hose.
Gas Burner 
Roccbox’s gas burner was a challenging component to get right. Although skilfully designed, it is the more simplistic of the two burners in terms of operational use and maintenance. You simply can't beat the consistency or convenience of a constant, regulated flame when optimising an environment for cooking Simply turn the gas burner on and adjust the temperature to suit your cooking style.
Wood Burner 
 
 
Roccbox’s wood burner is an engineering masterpiece and was the most challenging part of creating Roccbox. The wood burner is constructed of three layers of stainless steel, the outer most layer being perforated to prevent intense heat build up. The entire burner has been designed to draw air through its body, creating an intense flame with a secondary combustion that has all the power of a mini jet flame without the need of a power sourceIt really is a pretty cool piece of engineering!
Using the wood burner is a much more traditional process, but a uniquely rewarding one. Roccbox wouldn't be true to its roots without a sustainable fuel option and we think the authentic flavour that wood fired cooking brings to all dishes is more than worth the effort. Kiln dried, hardwood kindling is our recommended fuel of choice and you can even experiment with different wood types to achieve variations in flavour.
Check out some of our prototype burners here
  Commercial Grade Pizza Peel


The Roccbox pizza peel was designed to be ergonomic, lightweight, beautiful and functional. It is made from pressed aluminium and has tapered edges to ensure smooth transitions as your pizza is moved from its preparation surface to peel, from peel into the oven. The perforations in the peel allow for any excess flour to escape before placing the pizza into the oven because burnt flour on the underside of your pizza tastes bad and looks even worse! 
 
  Stone Cooking Floor

Getting the stone floor right was crucial to the success of Roccbox. We went through countless variations to get the right balance of density and porosity to ensure the stone performed excellently and created delicious pizza.  Once saturated with heat, Roccbox's cordierite stone absorbs moisture whilst cooking from the bottom up, creating the signature leopard spotted bases associated with an authentic Neapolitan style pizza.

 

 

Product Warranty. 
We are confident you will be able to enjoy Roccbox with your family and friends without a hitch. However, to cover our valued customers from any unlikely and unforeseen manufacturing defects or faults, every Roccbox comes with a 1 year warranty.

A team you can rely on

Here is a rare snapshot of just a handful of the Roccbox team. These guys are responsible for putting together our Indiegogo campagin. They form part of a much larger Roccbox family, some of whom you can read more about below. 
 

Tom - Founder & CEO
 
Roccbox is the brainchild of Tom, created back in 2012. When Tom isn’t embarking upon his next entrepreneurial endeavour or managing his multiple successful businesses, he loves to cook for his friends and family – he is a total foodie and all-round caveman. Tom’s vision was as clear as day every step of the way throughout the Roccbox design process and he has refused to compromise on any element. Now that the launch is in sight, he can’t wait to share Roccbox with the world.
 

Marcus - Production Manager
 
Joining the Roccbox team as a Project Coordinator last year, Marcus really has become our jack of all trades (and master of all of them!) Firstly brought on to coordinate the production process before branching out into all areas of Roccbox’s development, Marcus has been involved in absolutely every element of Roccbox behind the scenes, driving everything forward whilst also being Roccbox’s first point of contact. Chances are, if you’ve reached out to the team before, you know who Marcus is!
 

 
 
Georgia - Tom's Executive Assistant
Known informally as ‘G’ throughout the team and part of Roccbox from the very early days, Georgia provides full support to Tom and his staff. From chairing team meetings, to jumping in when times get hectic, project coordinating and cracking the whip where necessary, she has kept everyone on track ensuring we are all working to Tom’s ultimate goal of bringing Roccbox to market! 
 

Rich - Creative Director
 
We know each and every one of you has been ooh-ing and ah-ing over our incredible visuals and super slick website. Well, Rich is the man to thank for that! Part of the Roccbox team from the very beginning, with an extensive background in design and illustration and founder of his own digital design agency, Rich has been an invaluable asset in conveying our vision to the masses and communicating our mission digitally.
 
 

Laura - Project Co-ordinator
 
Part of the team from day one, Laura has been an integral cog in the Roccbox machine since the early days. From the early concept drawings, right the way through to factory visits, Laura brings to the team the unique balance of creativity and brains that have helped get Roccbox through every development hurdle it has faced!  
 

Mike, Patrick & Paul - Product Design and Engineering
 
The technical team; without them Roccbox simply wouldn’t exist! Patrick's wealth of experience in engineering and design, combined with Mike’s patience of a saint, profound skill as a product designer and draftsman means that each and every element of Roccbox has been considered by them, right down to the last rivet. What Paul brings to the mix is the ability to visualise Roccbox whilst everyone else is caught up in the nuts and bolts of it. He’s a CGI artist and really brought Roccbox to life when it was just drawings on scraps of paper!
 

Geoff - Head of R&D and Media Production
 
All round intellectual and food enthusiast, Geoff has been driving the research and development of Roccbox forward at full speed as well as managing the production of our video and photographic content for this campaign.  What else is there to say about Geoff? His culinary habits are famous in the office (let’s just say: serious lunch envy!) so good in fact that they’ve even made it into our Roccbox recipes!
 

Bronson - Office Dog
 
The office dog - there’s nothing he likes more than lounging about on the sofas all day, contributing nothing but adorable stress relief for the whole team. Always keeping a watchful eye on the comings and goings in the Roccbox office and we always know when guests arrive long before we hear a knock on the door! Sometimes a distraction but always a welcome one, he’s a vital member of the team.

</div></div>","Board Dash Hello, and Welcome to our company's Board Sports Display project - BoardDash. 

A Dashboard Style Display for Boards which also sends data to an App in your Phone and shows you real time statistics as you ride such as Air, Speed, Rotations and our world first data point ""Shudder"". It records your activity, spins, speed and location all for playback at a later time.
The display is made from the Brightest OLED we can source with 50,000 hours brightness.  You can view the Dash once the snow melts and you are on the Chair lift and compare your results of the previous run with your Mates. It is all about FUN!
We are including Bluetooth LE active up to 70m to send the statistics not just to your phone but to the displays of other parties such as Judges, T.V. Feeds and friends. 



We want to add the Real time Stats to such Televised events such as the X-Games and one day maybe even the Olympics!



Passion
My name is Chris and I am the founder of our company. I have a passion about all things to do with Board Sports, as do my partners. I have been skating since I was 8 on a ""skinny"", then started sandboarding when I was 12, making my own boards and selling them in sports shops in Australia all the way through College and have been snowboarding for over 20 years now.Here's me on my own design at 14, no bindings! Just skate grip and converse.
 
And here is me last month on the Front page of this newspaper introducing this city to their boarding potential. That's nearly 30 Years! I have been in many publications and T.V shows in between and this competition we have been running for ten years now below. 


As you can see I am one who fully believes the success of things is through perseverance, patience and not giving up and I think I have proven that in all I try to achieve. VisionFast forward to Board Dash. Born from Extreme Sports Passion.


We are always taking Jumps, speed, spins and new tree lines as part of the Adventure of riding. We were asking ourselves how much Air did we actually all get on the way down and with no way to compare, the idea of Board Dash was born. We saw other products on the market but they are all attached to the Body and hard to view inside a Goggle taking your eye and your concentration off the task. Or they are on your head that moves around. We want to ""record your board"". The reality of board sports is how you move the board with your skill.


The progression of design in the early days of boarding was immense but now boards have evolved to near perfect designs. I believe it is time to take Technology, snowboarding, and all board sports, and merge them for the New Generations.Our PCB Contains.

<p>Thanks for checking out our project! This project has been amazingly fun. Here at ColorRight, we've been making awesome white balance tools and flash diffusers for over 5 years. We've even won awards for our ColorRight PRO line of color balance tools.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9726/files/20130813102418-handheld.jpg?1376414658"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>But, now we need your help to get our newest creation, the Lumenator, off the ground. We have made a working prototype of a revolutionary type of LED lighting for both Photo and Video. The Lumenator dual purpose light is softer (LEDNatural technology), thinner (.5"") , lighter (13 ounces) and more flexible (dual purpose) than any conventional LED photo or video light. You can use the Lumenator as a revolutionary continuous cool light source, a photo flash diffuser, as a handheld light source, or as a small and powerful portable studio light.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9733/files/20130813102623-thin.jpg?1376414783"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Most pro LED photo and video lights are harsh and specular, unless diffused to within an inch of their life. Lumenator uses Patent Pending LEDNatural technology to produce the smoothest, most natural LED lighting you have ever seen. The Lumenator side-mounted LED lights are diffused multiple times before they light your subject. You won't get the typical squints, fake grins and hot spots that you get with conventional rear-mounted LED panels. In the case of the Lumenator, soft luscious light does not equal low power. Lumenator uses only high-grade Samsung daylight balanced LED chips rated at over 50 lumens per LED. In fact, Lumenator delivers almost as much power as a 300 watt incandescent bulb. These LED chips also have a high CRI (&gt;=80) providing natural and vivid color rendition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9737/files/20130813102807-Cross_Section_LEDNatural_Technology_4.jpg?1376414887"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>This is where you come in...</h3>
<p>The Lumenator is amazing, but we need your help to raise enough capital to get them made. We are still a small family run company. We believe the Lumenator will be our best product, by far. However, that also means the resources to get this product made are greater than any of our prior products.</p>

<h3>Your Impact &amp; Our Future Plans</h3>
<p>We think Lumenator is the future of photo &amp; video lighting. By contributing you are making a difference in the lives of photographers and videographers everywhere. The Lumenator project has the potential to totally up-end all our pre-conceived notions about what LED lighting can do, and where it can go. With the success of Lumenator we plan to introduce additional products utilizing our LEDNatural technology.</p>
<p>We believe the Lumenator represents the first product in a true 2nd wave of LED lighting technology. We can't wait to see where you take the Lumenator or what you do with it once you get there.</p>
<p>We can't get there without you. Please help us get the word out, by telling your family and friends and through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. This site has convenient links for most social sites right here on this page.</p>

<p>We are using top of the line Samsung LED chips with accurate color and great color fidelity. </p>
<p>These conventional LED panels also cannot double as a flash diffuser, they're much larger and heavier.</p>

Thanks for checking out our project! This project has been amazingly fun. Here at ColorRight, we've been making awesome white balance tools and flash diffusers for over 5 years. We've even won awards for our ColorRight PRO line of color balance tools.


But, now we need your help to get our newest creation, the Lumenator, off the ground. We have made a working prototype of a revolutionary type of LED lighting for both Photo and Video. The Lumenator dual purpose light is softer (LEDNatural technology), thinner (.5"") , lighter (13 ounces) and more flexible (dual purpose) than any conventional LED photo or video light. You can use the Lumenator as a revolutionary continuous cool light source, a photo flash diffuser, as a handheld light source, or as a small and powerful portable studio light.


Most pro LED photo and video lights are harsh and specular, unless diffused to within an inch of their life. Lumenator uses Patent Pending LEDNatural technology to produce the smoothest, most natural LED lighting you have ever seen. The Lumenator side-mounted LED lights are diffused multiple times before they light your subject. You won't get the typical squints, fake grins and hot spots that you get with conventional rear-mounted LED panels. In the case of the Lumenator, soft luscious light does not equal low power. Lumenator uses only high-grade Samsung daylight balanced LED chips rated at over 50 lumens per LED. In fact, Lumenator delivers almost as much power as a 300 watt incandescent bulb. These LED chips also have a high CRI (>=80) providing natural and vivid color rendition.

This is where you come in...
The Lumenator is amazing, but we need your help to raise enough capital to get them made. We are still a small family run company. We believe the Lumenator will be our best product, by far. However, that also means the resources to get this product made are greater than any of our prior products.
We need your help to fund the following:

Two Injection Molds for Production Parts
1-2 80W Laser Machines
3D CAD Designs & Revisions
3D Prints
Customized Side Mount Compatible Samsung LED Strips
Custom Laser-Cut Acrylic Diffusion Materials
Die for additional diffusion materials
LED Connectors & Wiring
Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries
Tungsten Gels
Custom Made Battery Cases
Tripod Mounts & Hot-Shoe Mounts
plus more...

Your Impact & Our Future Plans
We think Lumenator is the future of photo & video lighting. By contributing you are making a difference in the lives of photographers and videographers everywhere. The Lumenator project has the potential to totally up-end all our pre-conceived notions about what LED lighting can do, and where it can go.

We believe the Lumenator represents the first product in a true 2nd wave of LED lighting technology. We can't wait to see where you take the Lumenator or what you do with it once you get there.

<p><b>Passionately
fighting for freedom in cyberspace! Have you been blocked from your desirable websites,

friends on social sites? Yes, it can happen to you or anyone, depending on the

that there is  restriction on internet
use, we began our journey in pursuit of protecting  you and providing you with the ability to
view content freely, no matter where you are. By using technologically advanced
tools, we have created PlutoBoXX – a VPN wi-fi device, first device of its
kind, now available on the market. PlutoBoXX is a proprietary and intelligent
routing algorithm which allow users to have full internet access.</b></p>
<p><b>PlutoBoXX is programmed for <u>12
months</u> of uninterrupted VPN service, powered by PlutoVPN. PlutoBoXX is
the ultimate internet security solution that secures your web surfing and

<p><b>PlutoBoXX has been beta tested for six months and it works flawlessly,
even in China where the Great Fire Wall is known to cutoff VPN services.</b></p>

real IP with one from the US, you will appear as in US , thus making it
possible to access social media and entertainment streaming websites such as

Mi smo ekipa Uradi-zaradi i već tri godine pomažemo našim sugrađanima sa poslovima u kući. Sa više od 3,000 klijenata, 900 sati telefonskih razgovora i 10,000 razmenjenih mailova sa njima shvatili smo šta je potrebno jednoj porodici da bi se osećala potpuno komforno u svom domu.</p><p>Naravno da je potrebna pomoć… ali ne bilo kakva.</p><p>Ta pomoć treba da bude pouzdana i dostupna kada je potrebna, vesela, kvalitetna. I još po nešto.</p><p>Reče jednom jedna klijentkinja:</p><p>''Eeee, nije to moja kućna pomoćnica, to je moja Dara! Samo moja Dara može sve to i sve tako. Ustane rano, pa ode na pijacu, pa u 8 ujutru kad se ja spremam za posao ona zazvoni na vrata. Nisam se ni osvestila, već je prozujala po stanu i sa krpom u ruci se zavlači u špajz i kreće da gunđa. Pomislim, begaj na posao, ubiće te Dara! :) A onda kad krenem, isprati me sa osmehom, a po povratku me od nje čeka poruka na stolu. ‘Sve ti je popeglano, i za tebe i za muža i za decu, pa uzdravlje! Vidimo se u ponedeljak opet, Darita’’</p><p>Slušamo to i razmišljamo kako da napravimo još Dara. Dara je bre zmaj. Takvih više nema.</p><p>A onda rešimo da sve stavimo na papir. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Šta Dara zna?</strong></p><p>Dara čisti, pegla i slaže garderobu besprekorno. Miriše na čistoću. Poznaje pijacu, razume se u voće i povrće i zna da kupi kvalitetno. Zna koje vino voliš i to će te čekati u kućnom baru. Zna gde šta stoji u kući i uvek sve vrati na svoje mesto. </p><p><strong>Kakva je Dara?</strong></p><p>Dara je deo porodice. Brzo misli, snalazi se u teškim situacijama. Ima stav, a vedra je i nasmejana. Ne možeš da je ne voliš. Možeš joj reći kako želiš da bude i ona će se uvek potruditi da ispoštuje tvoja pravila.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Dara, Dara, Dara. Kako da uklopimo sve ovo? Pa to jedno je ceo sistem?! Dara je bre menadžer! Dara je menadžer, ali kuće. Dara je Home Manager!</strong></p><p><strong>Tako se rodila ideja kreiranja Home Managera. </strong>Naša ideja je da okupimo sve žene poput Dare, da ih obučimo kako da ti na najbolji način pomažu sa kućnim obavezama. Da ti kupe vreme.</p><p>Dara ne želi da te kad dođeš kući zatekne prazan frižider, niti da se nerviraš oko toga što već neko vreme nisi odnela suknju na hemijsko čišćenje i baš nikako nemaš vremena da zakazuješ majstora za sklapanje ormara, a potreban ti je taj ormar.</p><p><strong>Podrži projekat koji smo kreirali sa ciljem da do kraja godine zaposlimo 20 Home Managera.</strong></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Zašto te podrška ovog projekta čini društveno-odgovornim?</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Ovaj projekat vidimo kao šansu da mladim majkama, a naročito samohranim, pružimo priliku za zaposlenje na puno ili pola radnog vremena, obuku i put karijernog napretka.<br/><br/>Žene koje se bave čišćenjem u Srbiji često se suočavaju sa problemom nalaženja posla na kome imaju redovnu platu i mogućnost bilo kakvog napredovanja. Većina žena koje sarađuju sa Uradi-zaradi platformom su samohrane majke u potrazi za fer uslovima rada i boljom zaradom. Najveći izazov za njih je pronalazak stalnog i legalnog posla sa fleksibilnim radnim vremenom, zaštitom na radu kao i evidencijom na državnom zdravstvenom i penzionom fondu.</p><p><strong>Šta je to što mi nudimo a ti pomažeš?</strong></p><p>Kada smo prvi put u februaru 2019. sproveli anketu da li naše saradnice žele zaposlenje, impresionirao nas je broj pozitivnih odgovora. Razmatrali smo koje mogućnosti imamo i došli smo do zaključka da bi zapošljavanje doprinelo stabilnosti klijenata, kao i naših saradnica, a samim tim bismo imali mogućnost da uslugu čišćenja nadogradimo i ponudimo nešto zaista vredno svakoj porodici. A to je kreiranje Home Manager-a, kao jedne sveobuhvatne usluge asistencije u kućnim obavezama. </p><p><strong>Ono što nudimo Home Managerima jeste:</strong></p><p>- Posao sa fleksibilnim radnim vremenom kao i stalno zaposlenje na puno ili nepuno radno vreme</p><p>- Posao ćemo najpre ponuditi našim trenutno najvrednijim saradnicama kojima bi doneo bolje uslove života, kao i mogućnost napredovanja</p><p>- Planiramo da otpočnemo pregovore sa Sigurnom kućom (<a href=""http://www.sigurnakuca.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sigurnakuca.net/</a>) u cilju pružanja mogućnosti ženama iz Sigurne kuće da dobiju posao koji će im dati nezavisnost i sigurnost</p><p>- Početnu fiksnu neto platu Home managera u iznosu od 40,000 rsd za 6 sati rada, 5 dana u nedelji po ugovoru o radu na neodređeno</p><p> </p><h3>Kako možeš doprineti ovom projektu?</h3><h3><strong>#1 Kupovinom perka: 3 meseca usluge Home Managera </strong></h3><p>Kupovinom ovog perka rezervišeš svog Home Managera unapred i u novembru ove godine možeš da počneš sa ovom uslugom. Ovom rezervacijom postižeš i specijalan popust na godišnji paket koji ti omogućava uštedu od čak $320.</p><p><strong>Kako usluga Home Managera tačno funkcioniše:</strong></p><p>Kada bukiraš Home Managera imaš mogućnost da na nedeljnom nivou sarađuješ sa (uvek istom) osobom koja će se brinuti o tvojim kućnim poslovima. Najpre je potrebno da se dogovorite oko dana i sata u nedelji kada će se ova usluga izvšavati (npr. sreda u 9:00). Imaš 6 sati na raspologanju za svoje prioritete te nedelje. Ideja je da imaš 4 fiksna sata u tvom stanu na poslovima čišćenja, peglanja, slaganja odeće u ormar,... <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565795368/hs2h8ox7kfbv42actbnj.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Osim toga, preostala 2 sata Home Manager može provesti na poslovima kupovine u prodavnici, na pijaci ili apoteci, kao i doneti tvoju odeću sa hemijskog čišćenja, poslati paket poštom, kupiti sveže cveće i još mnogo toga. Potrebno je samo da na svoju ček-listu dodaš stavke koje su te nedelje prioritet.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565795380/t4ftbluhkc1ghhili1hu.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Za usluge Home Managera plaćaš mesečnu fiksnu naknadu i ona iznosi $160.

Mi smo ekipa Uradi-zaradi i već tri godine pomažemo našim sugrađanima sa poslovima u kući. Sa više od 3,000 klijenata, 900 sati telefonskih razgovora i 10,000 razmenjenih mailova sa njima shvatili smo šta je potrebno jednoj porodici da bi se osećala potpuno komforno u svom domu.Naravno da je potrebna pomoć… ali ne bilo kakva.Ta pomoć treba da bude pouzdana i dostupna kada je potrebna, vesela, kvalitetna. I još po nešto.Reče jednom jedna klijentkinja:''Eeee, nije to moja kućna pomoćnica, to je moja Dara! Samo moja Dara može sve to i sve tako. Ustane rano, pa ode na pijacu, pa u 8 ujutru kad se ja spremam za posao ona zazvoni na vrata. Nisam se ni osvestila, već je prozujala po stanu i sa krpom u ruci se zavlači u špajz i kreće da gunđa. Pomislim, begaj na posao, ubiće te Dara! :) A onda kad krenem, isprati me sa osmehom, a po povratku me od nje čeka poruka na stolu. ‘Sve ti je popeglano, i za tebe i za muža i za decu, pa uzdravlje! Vidimo se u ponedeljak opet, Darita’’Slušamo to i razmišljamo kako da napravimo još Dara. Dara je bre zmaj. Takvih više nema.A onda rešimo da sve stavimo na papir.  Šta Dara zna?Dara čisti, pegla i slaže garderobu besprekorno. Miriše na čistoću. Poznaje pijacu, razume se u voće i povrće i zna da kupi kvalitetno. Zna koje vino voliš i to će te čekati u kućnom baru. Zna gde šta stoji u kući i uvek sve vrati na svoje mesto. Kakva je Dara?Dara je deo porodice. Brzo misli, snalazi se u teškim situacijama. Ima stav, a vedra je i nasmejana. Ne možeš da je ne voliš. Možeš joj reći kako želiš da bude i ona će se uvek potruditi da ispoštuje tvoja pravila. Dara, Dara, Dara. Kako da uklopimo sve ovo? Pa to jedno je ceo sistem?! Dara je bre menadžer! Dara je menadžer, ali kuće. Dara je Home Manager!Tako se rodila ideja kreiranja Home Managera. Naša ideja je da okupimo sve žene poput Dare, da ih obučimo kako da ti na najbolji način pomažu sa kućnim obavezama. Da ti kupe vreme.Dara ne želi da te kad dođeš kući zatekne prazan frižider, niti da se nerviraš oko toga što već neko vreme nisi odnela suknju na hemijsko čišćenje i baš nikako nemaš vremena da zakazuješ majstora za sklapanje ormara, a potreban ti je taj ormar.Podrži projekat koji smo kreirali sa ciljem da do kraja godine zaposlimo 20 Home Managera. Zašto te podrška ovog projekta čini društveno-odgovornim? Ovaj projekat vidimo kao šansu da mladim majkama, a naročito samohranim, pružimo priliku za zaposlenje na puno ili pola radnog vremena, obuku i put karijernog napretka.Žene koje se bave čišćenjem u Srbiji često se suočavaju sa problemom nalaženja posla na kome imaju redovnu platu i mogućnost bilo kakvog napredovanja. Većina žena koje sarađuju sa Uradi-zaradi platformom su samohrane majke u potrazi za fer uslovima rada i boljom zaradom. Najveći izazov za njih je pronalazak stalnog i legalnog posla sa fleksibilnim radnim vremenom, zaštitom na radu kao i evidencijom na državnom zdravstvenom i penzionom fondu.Šta je to što mi nudimo a ti pomažeš?Kada smo prvi put u februaru 2019. sproveli anketu da li naše saradnice žele zaposlenje, impresionirao nas je broj pozitivnih odgovora. Razmatrali smo koje mogućnosti imamo i došli smo do zaključka da bi zapošljavanje doprinelo stabilnosti klijenata, kao i naših saradnica, a samim tim bismo imali mogućnost da uslugu čišćenja nadogradimo i ponudimo nešto zaista vredno svakoj porodici. A to je kreiranje Home Manager-a, kao jedne sveobuhvatne usluge asistencije u kućnim obavezama. Ono što nudimo Home Managerima jeste:- Posao sa fleksibilnim radnim vremenom kao i stalno zaposlenje na puno ili nepuno radno vreme- Posao ćemo najpre ponuditi našim trenutno najvrednijim saradnicama kojima bi doneo bolje uslove života, kao i mogućnost napredovanja- Planiramo da otpočnemo pregovore sa Sigurnom kućom (http://www.sigurnakuca.net/) u cilju pružanja mogućnosti ženama iz Sigurne kuće da dobiju posao koji će im dati nezavisnost i sigurnost- Početnu fiksnu neto platu Home managera u iznosu od 40,000 rsd za 6 sati rada, 5 dana u nedelji po ugovoru o radu na neodređeno Kako možeš doprineti ovom projektu?#1 Kupovinom perka: 3 meseca usluge Home Managera Kupovinom ovog perka rezervišeš svog Home Managera unapred i u novembru ove godine možeš da počneš sa ovom uslugom. Ovom rezervacijom postižeš i specijalan popust na godišnji paket koji ti omogućava uštedu od čak $320.Kako usluga Home Managera tačno funkcioniše:Kada bukiraš Home Managera imaš mogućnost da na nedeljnom nivou sarađuješ sa (uvek istom) osobom koja će se brinuti o tvojim kućnim poslovima. Najpre je potrebno da se dogovorite oko dana i sata u nedelji kada će se ova usluga izvšavati (npr. sreda u 9:00). Imaš 6 sati na raspologanju za svoje prioritete te nedelje. Ideja je da imaš 4 fiksna sata u tvom stanu na poslovima čišćenja, peglanja, slaganja odeće u ormar,... Osim toga, preostala 2 sata Home Manager može provesti na poslovima kupovine u prodavnici, na pijaci ili apoteci, kao i doneti tvoju odeću sa hemijskog čišćenja, poslati paket poštom, kupiti sveže cveće i još mnogo toga. Potrebno je samo da na svoju ček-listu dodaš stavke koje su te nedelje prioritet.Za usluge Home Managera plaćaš mesečnu fiksnu naknadu i ona iznosi $160. Nakon bukiranja ovog osnovnog paketa možeš smanjiti broj sati koje Home Manager provede kod tebe na određenim poslovima. U skladu sa tim i cena će biti drugačija. Takođe, cena ove usluge je $40 po dolasku, pa uslugu Home Managera možeš korigovati da bude 2x nedeljno ili jedanput u dve nedelje.Ukoliko si ti neko ko jako ceni slobodno vreme, Home Manager može biti rešenje na koje čekaš. Zamisli JEDNU OSOBU koja se brine da sve funkcioniše.Zvuči super, zar ne? #2 Možeš finansijski podržati zapošljavanje Home Managera Ukoliko ti se sviđa projekat, ali trenutno nemaš potrebu da koristiš uslugu Home Managera, možeš da podržiš projekat novčano i tako pomogneš da ova ideja postane stvarnost: Investicijom od:$ 10-49 - dobijaš online zahvalnicu na emailu ili našim društvenim mrežama$ 50-249 - dobijaš šolju sa unikatnom zahvalnicom od Home Managera, kao i zahvalnicu na email$ 250-499 - dobijaš zahvalnicu u obliku videa koji će nakon zapošljavanja Home Manager snimiti kako bi ti objasnio koliko mu ovaj posao znači, kao i promociju tebe ili tvoje kompanije na našem blogu, društvenim mrežama i u medijima $ 500 i više - ti si za nas neko ko ovu kampanju podržava na jednom posebnom nivou, pa ćemo tvoje ime ili logo firme objaviti na našem glavnom sajtu kao sponzora kampanje, a takođe smo spremni da sa tobom razgovaramo o predlozima za potencijalnu saradnju na projektu Ovo je tvoja prilika da učiniš dobro delo, a pritom i sebi zaradiš slobodno vreme. Iskoristi je! Jer dobrih prilika je malo! Hvala najlepše, ljubi te Dara! Support us to employ 20 young single moms as a Home Managers in our start-up company.

We are happy to use this Indiegogo project to announce our revolutionary EnerGenie LED bulb based upon (patent pending) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pipe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">heat pipe</a> design. Heat pipes are quite common solution for cooling computer CPUs but so far have never been used in LED bulbs. The biggest problem of traditional LED bulbs is heat. The heat not only decreases overall performance of the bulb but also causes long-term degradation of the LEDs and even the bulb to totally fail. Our engineering team used their expert knowledge in the CPU cooling field to construct the most efficient LED bulb in the world!</p>
<p align=""center""><font color=""green"" size=""5""><strong>EnerGenie LED bulb - the world's best!</strong></font></p>
<p align=""left"">EnerGenie LED bulb produces awesome 135 lumens per watt. It is around 40% better than the traditional LED bulbs!</p>

<p align=""center""><font color=""green"" size=""5""><strong>EnerGenie LED bulb - best quality light!</strong></font></p>
<p>We placed LEDs in three dimensions in our EnerGenie LED bulb as opposed to the traditional 2D placement of the LEDs. The outcome is a far greater lit area - 330 degrees, while traditional LED bulbs barely provide 140-160 degrees. </p>
<p>The EnerGenie LED bulb is dimmable and is available in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">color temperatures</a> of 2700K (warm light) and 4000K (white neutral light).</p>
<p>The EnerGenie LED bulb has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Color Rendering Index </a>of 85 and is available in High CRI version (CRI 92). The colors would look natural with our EnerGenie LED bulb!</p>

<p><span>The driver is well separated from the heat source - failure of EnerGenie LED bulb is virtually impossible. </span></p>

<p>The major reason we published this project at Indiegogo is to get the feedback from the market. With your contribution you will actually be voting for the EnerGenie LED bulb to be available in your country. </p>
<p>We are grateful for your support! With the retail prices expected to be Euro 39.95 in Europe and USD 49.95 in USA, with our pre-order options you could save up to 60% of the cost!</p>
<p>All the options available for contribution are for the most popular 2700K (warm light) color temperature (let us know by e-mail if you prefer a 4000K version instead). With the options Donor 1/Donor 2/Donor 3 you would get a basic 8W model. Use 1350 lumens or 1600 lumens options to pre-order 10 and 12W models respectively. </p>

<p><b>Some FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):</b></p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Internet is full of stories about failures of LED lamps. How would EnerGenie LED bulb rate in this respect?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The major reason of a LED lamp failure is the heat penetrating to the driver. Let us have a look at the traditional LED lamp design:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/140260/files/20131018045629-T-LED.jpg?1382097389"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As you can see with this design the driver is placed right next to the source of heat - LEDs. The excessive heat might dry up the electrolytic capacitors inside the driver, the outcome of which is the lamp failure!</p>
<p>Now let us check what happens inside the EnerGenie lamp:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/140263/files/20131018045922-EG-LED.jpg?1382097562"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The driver is placed far away from the LEDs. So the failure of EnerGenie LED bulb is next to impossible!</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can this bulb be used in a closed fixture with no opening, like a globe or sphere? Or, must this bulb have air circulation for good, long life? </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The big advantage of the EnerGenie LED bulb is that the driver is well separated from the source of heat. See the picture below:</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/158783/files/20131028054945-EG_lamp_disassembled_small.jpg?1382964585"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>So unlike the traditional LED lamps the driver will not suffer from the overheating at all. We have been testing the EnerGenie LED lamp in a closed fixture shown below for more than a year, without any issues for the driver:</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/158794/files/20131028055241-EG_lamp_photo_3_small.JPG?1382964761"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Would you be able to prove this statement with the measurements? What is the temperature inside the driver cavity after 30 minutes of operation?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Below you will find the table with the temperature measurements (in degrees Celsius) inside the driver compartment. All the measurements are taken for the lamps inside the closed fixture shown above.</p>
<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""3"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody>

<p>Have a look at the chart with these measurements:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/158799/files/20131028055519-table-2.jpg?1382964919"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The advantage of the EnerGenie LED bulb over the traditional LED bulbs is quite clear! And of course, lower temperature of the driver guarantees much longer lifetime of the bulb.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How about LED degradation? I heard that the LED lamps produce less light over the time.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Correct. This issue is also related to the heat. The LEDs produce much less light when they are exposed to high temperatures. But there are also long term degradation issues. See the chart below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/140316/files/20131018052934-LED_degradation.png?1382099374"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You will see that the LEDs exposed to 100 degrees Celsius (which is normal for traditional LEDs) would lose around 30% of their light intensity after 10000 hours of use. Compare it with 40000 hours by 60 degrees Celsius (LED temperature inside the EnerGenie LED bulb). This is why we claim much longer lifetime for our design!</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>You claim that EnerGenie LED lamp is able to combat the heat much better than the traditional LED lamps. What is the reason for that?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Indeed EnerGenie design is all about efficient heat dissipation. </p>
<p>Traditional LED lamp has a low-efficiency radiator. In fact only the edges of the radiator are conducting the heat efficiently while the middle is quite useless. The LEDs of the traditional LED lamps are placed on ALPCB, which is glued to the radiator. Consequently the LEDs placed in the middle of the lamp are most suffering from the heat issues. Further to save the cost the radiator is hardly able to dissipate the heat produced by the LEDs even under the ideal conditions of air convection. In the real world the LED bulbs are placed into tight lamp shades with the conditions far from ideal.</p>
<p>EnerGenie LED lamp has a unique heat-pipe design where the heat dissipation is close to perfection. The radiator is designed in such a redundant way that he is able to dissipate 21W of energy while only 8W is required. So even if the EnerGenie LED lamp is used in a very tight lamp shade there would be no issues with the overheating!</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>How can you explain the EnerGenie LED lamp being able to work more efficiently in comparison to the traditional LED lamps? And produce 330 degrees of lit area at the same time? Where is the trick?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We do use the industry's best LEDs but this is not the major reason of the EnerGenie lamp efficiency. Let us have a look at the structure of a traditional LED lamp again:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/143421/files/20131020035133-T-LED-small.jpg?1382266293"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As you can see the LEDs are placed on a single flat surface. The light they produce is quite similar to what you would get from a uni-directional torch. To increase the lit area through the light reflection the glass is covered with a special coating. The result is indeed a somewhat greater lit area (never more than 140-160 degrees). The biggest trouble of this solution is that some light (up to 40%) gets trapped inside the bulb leading to extra heat and poor efficiency of the lamp in general.</p>
<p>The EnerGenie design is totally different:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/143424/files/20131020040407-EG-LED-small.jpg?1382267047"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The trick is that LEDs are producing the light in all directions! In fact no coating of the glass is required with this solution at all (if the glass is slighty tinted then it is to produce a warmer light, for no other purpose)! No reflective coating means no loss of energy - 0% loss in the EnerGenie lamp. This special LED placement also provides the lit area of 330 degrees. So in all respects the EnerGenie LED lamp produces the light quality comparable with the old incadescent lamps using only fraction of the energy!</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">color temperature</a> of your EnerGenie lamp?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>At this moment we plan two modifications of the EnerGenie lamp - 2700K (warm light) and 4000K (white neutral light). Please, do specify with your contribution which lamps you would want to receive.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How about the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">color rendering index</a> of your EnerGenie lamp?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The color rendering index (CRI) is a very important parameter of the light quality. With CRI = 100 (the day light) we perceive all the colors in a natural way. Low CRI contributes to color distortions. For the lamps the CRI should be higher than 80 for the good quality light. Our EnerGenie lamp uses the industry's best LEDs which allows it to have CRI of around 85. Traditional budget LED lamps normally have CRI of around 75.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Can you achieve 90 CRI in the future?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We can produce 90+ CRI EnerGenie LED bulb right now. However the trouble with the high-CRI version is that we should use different LEDs and the lamp would become much less efficient. For CRI 90+ (we expect around 92-93 to be more exact) the lamp would consume around 11W of energy and produce around 840 lm of light.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the power factor of EnerGenie LED bulb?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">power factor</a> of an AC electrical device is the ratio between the energy used by the device and the energy which bounces back to the energy provider. An efficient device should have the power factor greater than 0.9. EnerGenie LED bulb has the power factor of 0.95.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What’s your sales pitch to someone who can get a pack of 8-10 compact fluorescent lightbulbs (13W actual, 60 W equivalent) for the low price of $6.00. I did the math comparing the difference in energy consumption between my current lights &amp; your LED lights; it would take me 20 years to break even, assuming a cost of $0.085 per KWH, 6 hour run time, 365 days a year. Why would someone want to make the switch? I’m content with the light quality in my house. I see no economic rationale to do this.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Lifetime of EnerGenie LED lamp will be <strong>7-8 times longer</strong> than CFLs. So you would have to buy 7-8 CFLs during the lilfetime of one EnerGenie LED bulb. Addtionally every switching CFLs on and off decreases their lifetime - there is no such issue with the EnerGenie LED bulbs. </p>
<p>Lumen per watt is also much lower. Energy cost might be low in your country now (since it is heavily subsidised), but would keep growing. </p>
<p>It is important to notice that CFLs contain mercury which is <strong>dangerous for the health</strong>. </p>
<p>CFLs are also quite troublesome to use - they take time to warm up, might also produce flickering and/or humming noises, harsh light with low CRI. You would really enjoy the EnerGenie LED bulb in comparison with your CFLs!</p>

We, Gembird Europe BV, are a European manufacturer of computer-related products. We are happy to use this Indiegogo project to announce our revolutionary EnerGenie LED bulb based upon (patent pending) heat pipe design. Heat pipes are quite common solution for cooling computer CPUs but so far have never been used in LED bulbs. The biggest problem of traditional LED bulbs is heat. The heat not only decreases overall performance of the bulb but also causes long-term degradation of the LEDs and even the bulb to totally fail. Our engineering team used their expert knowledge in the CPU cooling field to construct the most efficient LED bulb in the world!
EnerGenie LED bulb - the world's best!
EnerGenie LED bulb produces awesome 135 lumens per watt. It is around 40% better than the traditional LED bulbs!

 
EnerGenie LED bulb - best quality light!
We placed LEDs in three dimensions in our EnerGenie LED bulb as opposed to the traditional 2D placement of the LEDs. The outcome is a far greater lit area - 330 degrees, while traditional LED bulbs barely provide 140-160 degrees. 
The EnerGenie LED bulb is dimmable and is available in color temperatures of 2700K (warm light) and 4000K (white neutral light).
The EnerGenie LED bulb has a Color Rendering Index of 85 and is available in High CRI version (CRI 92). The colors would look natural with our EnerGenie LED bulb!
 
EnerGenie LED bulb - guaranteed longer lifetime!
Efficient cooling of the LEDs means there will be no decrease in light output over years of use, while traditional LED bulbs lose around 30% of their intensity after just 10000 hours.
The driver is well separated from the heat source - failure of EnerGenie LED bulb is virtually impossible. 
An EnerGenie LED bulb will work perfectly even in a closed light fixture - where the most LED bulbs would fail to work at all! 
EnerGenie LED bulb will save you money!
During the lifetime of one EnerGenie LED bulb you would have to buy several traditional bulbs. This on top of the electricity cost savings!

 
EnerGenie LED bulb - true replacement to 100W incandescent!
There are 3 modifications of EnerGenie LED bulb available:


8 W version producing 1080 lumens which is equivalent to 70 W incandescent
10 W version producing 1350 lumens which is equivalent to 85 W incandescent
12 W version producing 1600 lumens which is equivalent to 100 W incandescent

 
EnerGenie LED bulb @ Indiegogo
We have already invested money in production of EnerGenie LED lamp. The mass production is scheduled to be launched in January 2014 and the first shipments can be made in March 2014. With its own factories, Gembird will take care of all technical and production aspects.
The major reason we published this project at Indiegogo is to get the feedback from the market. With your contribution you will actually be voting for the EnerGenie LED bulb to be available in your country. 
We are grateful for your support! With the retail prices expected to be Euro 39.95 in Europe and USD 49.95 in USA, with our pre-order options you could save up to 60% of the cost!
All the options available for contribution are for the most popular 2700K (warm light) color temperature (let us know by e-mail if you prefer a 4000K version instead). With the options Donor 1/Donor 2/Donor 3 you would get a basic 8W model. Use 1350 lumens or 1600 lumens options to pre-order 10 and 12W models respectively. 
EnerGenie LED bulb - reliable and thoroughly tested!
The prototype bulbs have been extensively tested in table lamps and ceiling light (upside down) for more than one year. More than one thousand EnerGenie LED bulbs have already been produced as a test batch. The EnerGenie LED bulb is a mature product and we are ready for the mass production which would take place in January 2014.
By March 2014 the EnerGenie LED bulb will be certified by UL/ETL/CE. It will be tested against the following standards:

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div></span></div>","Keeping it Simple:
I'm breaking the Guinness World Record for ""Longest Unicycle Trip,"" and I'm several hundred miles into it already!  The current record is just over 9,000 miles, and I hope to more than double it.
I'm also raising money for three charities: Greenpeace, International Child Art Foundation, and Sy's Fund.
I'm passionate about protectingwaterways and greenspaces, promoting kid's art education in school, and giving young adults with cancer more to live for.  This is what they do, and this is why I'm diverting some of the attention inevitably cast upon my one-wheeling self towards good.


Spread the Love!
Just like the endless spinning of my one wheel, everything comes full circle. So pay it forward!
You money will be divided exactly in half. 
One half will go directly and evenly to all three charities.
The Other Half will go to my support costs.  This includes ongoing gear and food costs during the trip, and also a little towards thank-you postcards!  Remember, the half that goes to me enables me to continue the trip and raise money throughout - so let's get that momentum going!

<h3>InboxPro.com</h3>
<p><img alt=""Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://inboxpro.com/images/logo.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 8px;""/>InboxPro is an effort to 'fix' your inbox. Right now you might receive hundreds of emails per week. Some are short, some are long, some are 'For Your Infomation' only. Unfortunately the subject line hardly ever gives you insight into how much time will be involved in answering the message.</p>
<p>Likewise, the sender is left in the dark too. Why aren't you replying quickly? Is your inbox empty or overflowing? How long does it generally takes before I can expect a reply?</p>
<p>Inbox Pro solves both problems by making it easier for the receiving person to manage email and by giving the sender more insight in the 'Average Response Time' and the current queue in the receivers inbox. The system is currently in closed beta and fairly limited in its functionality but people who use it already report being significantly more efficient in handling their email. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would love to raise some money to be able to expand the team and get this to market as quickly as possible. The only thing this money will be used for is people. The founders won't take money out or receive a management fee, we will pay for the servers ourselves and we will handle all other costs ourselves too. We just want to hire two extra developers and hope that by doing some pre-sales here we will be able to delay having to raise funding, and maybe even prevent ever having to raise funding at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we raise €50.000 we will use that to pay two developers €2300 a month.</li>
<li>The remaining money will be used to hire free-lance designers, interaction designers, and iOS/Android developers. </li>
<li>If we won't raise the full amount of funding that will just mean we have to work harder.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Team</h3>

Boris is a serial entrepreneur and has (co-)founded TwitterCounter.com, V3.com, TheNextWeb.com and a range of other companies that have done well. Jeffrey is a college student who took on this (so far) unpaid job because he wanted to learn how develop awesome stuff. </p>

<td>1. Two-way audio/one-way video: When someone rings the doorbell, it will send a notification to your phone. Then, using the Xchime app, you'll be able to converse with (and see) whoever is at your door.<br/>2. Motion detection: An intelligent motion sensor is built into the doorbell. The doorbell can detect people, even if the doorbell is not rung. Cloud recording begins immediately when this happens.<br/>3. Live-view: If you want to monitor the front door in real-time, simply open the app to access Xchime's continuous live stream.<br/>4. Add-on smart light bulb: You can automatically link a smart light bulb to your Xchime. In the evening, the smart light bulb will automatically turn on if the doorbell is rung. This makes the home appear occupied and can dissuade potential thieves from attempting to break in.<br/>5. Weather resistance: Thanks to its patent pending technology, Xchime can be used at a wide temperature range of -40˚F to 150˚F, enabling it to be used effectively in rain, snow or intense humidity.<br/>6. Cloud recording: Video is continously recorded into the cloud, providing helpful evidence should a robbery or other incident occur.<br/>7. No latency: When the doorbell rings, a video connection to your smartphone is established immediately, without a delay. Additionally, when Xchime's motion-sensing technology detects action, video recording begins instantaneously.<br/>8. Garage-door backup: Think you forgot to close your garage door? Seeing is believing. With the add-on garage accessory, simply open the Xchime app (no matter how far away you are from home). If the garage door is still open, you'll receive an option to tap your phone and close it.<br/>9. Indoor video camera: Xchime doubles as a regular indoor video camera to view or record any suspicious activity.</td>

 Your go-to kitchen knife Your chef knife is central to creating nearly every dish. Whether you’re mincing chives, or cutting apart a whole chicken, the chef knife can do it all.However, your choices at the store are confusing. Cheap knives are clunky to use and dull quickly. Even if you're willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right blade can be a frustrating experience, but we don’t think that needs to be the case.An incredible knife for a fair price The world of chef knives is out of date. The big knife brands are operating on outdated sales margins that inflate the price of knives sold at a retail store. By avoiding the traditional retail sales model and bringing our product to you directly online, we have created a great knife for a fraction of the price.Don’t waste your money on a knife block filled with knives you’ll never use. Get the one knife you’ll reach for again and again.Comparison of the costs that go into bringing you a knife One great bladeA good knife stays sharp and is comfortable to use. A great knife is the one you reach for.We’ve put a ton of attention into how people hold and use their knives, and we think we’ve designed the ultimate hybrid. A knife that takes the best elements of western and eastern knifemaking, and combines them into one blade.After experimenting with dozens of blade profiles, grip shapes and types of steel, we’ve created an incredibly sharp blade that feels right at home in your hand. A long deep belly helps with effortless chopping, while the lowered tip makes slicing and finer work more approachable.  Grip & Bolster  The grip and bolster are designed with intention.

<h2>Introducing Whisper the Hush Buddy</h2>
<p>A night-light so smart it teaches toddlers to go to sleep quickly and quietly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521993196/epiqdu09zucqp8h3iyjl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>How is it Possible?</p>
<p>Whisper the Hush Buddy is a night-light that <u>listens</u> to the room. If the toddler is noisy, Whisper dims until the child is quiet again. </p>
<p>A special bedtime story accompanies Whisper. In one reading, the child meets Whisper, and learns Hush Buddies need quiet to glow their brightest. Their new friend gives them gentle but effective motivation to stay quiet at bedtime.</p>
<p>Hush Buddy was invented by a father of twins who was trying to sleep when the 2 year old in the next room began to cry out. That was the Eureka moment.</p>
<p>Sleep experts were consulted. The behavioral science behind the idea checked out.</p>
<p>A prototype was built. The bedtime story written and illustrated. Test families recruited. All reported Hush Buddy ""very effective"" in no more than two night's use.</p>
<p>Best of all, we learned toddlers who get more sleep have better cognitive development that benefits them the rest of their lives. And we could be a part of that!</p>
<p>By this point, we're excited, our test families are excited, and we hope you are too. It's time to get this life changing system out to eager families.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>What ages are well suited for Hush Buddy?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend Hush Buddy for children ages 2 to 4. </p>
<p><strong>Won't my child cry MORE if the room's dark?</strong></p>
<p>First, Hush Buddy doesn't go completely dark. It just dims. Second, thanks to the bedtime story, the child learns to expect that behavior from Whisper. Our test families reported their children wanted to be quiet to help their new friend.</p>
<p><strong>How big is Hush Buddy?</strong></p>
<p>Hush Buddy stands about 6 inches tall, and 5 inches wide and deep. The size makes it easy to put Whisper in a suitcase for travel.</p>
<p><strong>I've ordered the perk with my child's name listed in the book, but there was nowhere to enter the name. How will you know what name to add to the list?</strong></p>
<p>We will contact you via email for the child's name.</p>
<p><strong>How will my child's name be listed in the book?</strong></p>
<p>The bedtime story has both an English and Spanish version. In between will be a list of approximately 400 names receiving a special Thank You from the Hush Buddies.</p>
<p><strong>Does the character move or do anything? Maybe play music?</strong></p>
<p>No. That's by design. We don't want Whisper to be stimulative, or associated with playtime. Our instructions and storybook set up Whisper to be associated with quiet and bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>What's in the Parent's Guide?</strong></p>
<p>So much that will help you have better bedtimes! First, you'll learn to view bedtime through your child's eyes. It's surprising! You'll learn good routines to put in place leading up to bedtime, and night-by-night strategies to employ when using Hush Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>What if my child has sleep apnea or some other medical issue?</strong></p>
<p>Hush Buddy isn't a medical device, and isn't intended to treat medical conditions like sleep apnea.</p>
<p><strong>Will it stop my child from coming into my room in the middle of the night?</strong></p>
<p>We consulted sleep doctors about this very issue. They tell us, as a child learns to go to sleep independently at the beginning of the night, they have a better chance of simply falling back to sleep by themselves when they wake in the middle of the night. Often, child seek out their parents because they think they <u>need</u> that parent to be able to fall asleep. With Hush Buddy, the child can learn how to go to sleep independently.</p>
<p><strong>Does Hush Buddy stay on all night?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It's important for the child to have a consistent environment all night long. If they wake and the room is different somehow, there's a chance that will disturb the child enough that they won't fall back to sleep.</p>

So much that will help you have better bedtimes! First, you'll learn to view bedtime through your child's eyes. It's surprising! You'll learn good routines to put in place leading up to bedtime, and night-by-night strategies to employ when using Hush Buddy.
What if my child has sleep apnea or some other medical issue?
Hush Buddy isn't a medical device, and isn't intended to treat medical conditions like sleep apnea.
Will it stop my child from coming into my room in the middle of the night?
We consulted sleep doctors about this very issue. They tell us, as a child learns to go to sleep independently at the beginning of the night, they have a better chance of simply falling back to sleep by themselves when they wake in the middle of the night. Often, child seek out their parents because they think they need that parent to be able to fall asleep. With Hush Buddy, the child can learn how to go to sleep independently.
Does Hush Buddy stay on all night?
Yes. It's important for the child to have a consistent environment all night long. If they wake and the room is different somehow, there's a chance that will disturb the child enough that they won't fall back to sleep.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The founder of our company, Marvin Philip, hurt his back while working.  This not only caused Marvin to miss work, but it also made it difficult to do things at home such as bending over to empty his laundry hamper.</p>
<p>His injury lead him to search for a hamper that would not cause additional strain on his back.  Marvin searched everywhere in hopes of finding a product that would fulfill his needs.  He even solicited help from family members to find a hamper that would work for him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was not a product found on the market to help Marvin.  Last year, Marvin decided that he would create a product to help fill the need that he saw existing in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past 15 months, Marvin has dedicated all of his time and financial resources into creating the Lifter Hamper™.  The product has gone through multiple designs and toolings.  It has been put through rigorus tests so that it can be a quality product.  Patents have been filed and engineers have fine tuned the Lifter Hamper™ so that the hamper will be unique and do exactly what Marvin has envisioned it would do.</p>
You may know someone who is elderly, suffers from back pain, is pregnant, or struggles to bend over for whatever reason.  They probably dread the task of doing laundry.  The Lifter Hamper™ is a product that has been designed to simply help these people! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Lifter Hamper™ doesn't have to be just for those who have problems bending over. It can benefit anyone and everyone who does their laundy.  Why should anyone put a strain on your back when you don't have to??? </div>

It may have seemed unbelievable at first. You may have thought sleep could never be so wonderful. Try and try as you might, you could never quite capture that same magic.You try everything, even buying an ""orthopedic pillow"" in the hope that it would make a difference. Unfortunately, it is NOT the same. You wake up feeling less-than-completely rested, and there is even a kink in your neck.We know your frustration. Constantly searching for a deep and restful sleep that seemed intent on evading us, we took action, creating the SOFY® Pillow for softer and more comfortable sleep than may have ever thought possible.Pre-order the SOFY® Pillow and revolutionize your sleep once and for all!        The next generation of contouring pillows is here. It's the inner technology that counts!Featuring the patent-pending multi-regional contouring technology, the SOFY Pillow conforms to the shade of your body perfectly, optimizing the support and alignment you can expect while you are asleep. Going beyond the mere responsiveness and soft texture of memory foam, the SOFY Pillow is the type of sleep innovation that only comes along just once in a generation.The major difference between the SOFY Pillow and all other high-quality pillows is that its impact reaches deep below the surface, its inner mechanisms working more effectively than traditional memory foam can. You are giving your body complete, reliable support because of the inner contour piston technology we have built into the SOFY pillow, so whatever position you sleep in, you can fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep more deeply. You never need to worry about turning over in your sleep, either: the pillow adjusts as you do for constant, perfect repositioning. SOFY® Pillow helps to restore your natural neck c-curve for proper alignment and distribute the weight off your head, neck and shoulders for optimal pressure relief on your nerves and muscles. Sofy promotes better spine health. Compare the difference!  Over-heating will be a thing of the past!SOFY® Pillow has ventilation holes so that the heat coming from the body will dissipate and not build up on the pillow.   Furthermore, we've constructed a double-sided pillow cover to maximize breathability even more!
The bamboo side consists of bamboo, which is a natural ingredient that prevents heat build-up.
The mesh side is for maximum breathability. The micro vents in the mesh material promotes even more efficient ventilation so that you won’t have to worry about the heat bothering your sleep anymore.
     Built for comfort & built to last!SOFY® Pillow will not go flat on you, soothing you to sleep night after night. We made sure to use high-quality materials for long-lasting durability.       SOFY® Pillow is germ-resistant and hypoallergenic. It fights back against the particles that cause discomfort, illness, and disease, including bacteria, mold, viruses, mildew, dust mites, and allergens. Simultaneously, the SOFY Pillow prevents odor-causing germs from taking root so that you can always count on a fresh scent and pleasant texture.     Super-functional dual-sided cover with an all-around zipper for easy cover removal  The pillow cover, which includes a 180-degree zipper system, is easy to remove for simple cleaning too, and it is washer-safe and dryer-safe.",44.0,3,"1 Campaign

Then at night, Sophie will automatically record your nightly sleep cycle including when you lift your head off of the pillow and any sounds you make. In the morning, Sophie will use all of the information provided to help you fine-tune your habits for your best possible night’s rest.        The unique height-adjustable system allows you to tailor your pillow to yourexact customized support, depending on your size and preference.Unlike other adjustable pillows, you can simply squeeze to change the heightof the SleepSmart Pillow while laying down on it to find the best support height that you need. The Cloud Support System is topped with a Comfort Layer, which is surrounded by aninnovative 3D weave fabric that’s removable and washable. The 3D weave is not onlyincredibly soft, but also breathable, so you feel like your head is resting on a cloudand, unlike memory foam, you’ll always be on the cool side of the pillow. The SleepSmart Pillow has a built-in vibration alarm that will wake you upduring the lightest phase of your sleep cycle. Use the SleepSmart app toset the time you want to be woken up as well the intensity of the vibration.The vibration gradually increases in intensity to wake you up,but will not generate noise to disturb your partner. Don't just take our word for it!Here's why people love the SleepSmart Pillow:

<p>The idea for improving the ordering processes for us was actually hatched some 10 years ago at the office water cooler (yes really, before OpenGadget) with some colleagues who were working on their BMW.  It wasn't until working on a particularly difficult generator about 5 years ago that the idea actually stuck and I thought, ""Hey, this is possible.""  It took tossing out or replacing perfectly good digital cameras because the battery door would not stay closed and no one knew where to get replacements.

<h3><strong>The Ultimate Field Service Tool</strong></h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><h3></h3>
<p>We think this is the ultimate field service tool so we are also working on mobile versions for tablets and smartphones.  When we have the application ready and you install the app on your device, you can download and take the instructions with you. Take them into the field or garage.  Need to order the part from your supplier while in the field? We can set up accounts to order in-house instead.  Your mobile device becomes the ultimate tool for field service work.</p>

<h3>A Better Way to Shop - Especially for Hard to Find Things</h3>
<p>Repairs can sometimes be difficult, but the most difficult aspect should not be in identifying the part you need.  Even then it can be a hassle to describe when it comes time to order.  Who remembers all those part numbers anyway?  Even the very best parts managers get tripped up. In a flat 2D world this problem happens every day. We have even been asked to help sort out ordering systems for auto dealerships because the order taking process is so difficult even for them. Either way, <em>3D Click-to-Buy(TM)</em> will have you covered.</p>
<p><em><strong>Matching Game Not Fun Anymore!</strong></em></p>
<p>Remember the matching game?  It was kind of fun as a kid, but it isn't so fun when the repairs are costing you money.</p>
<span><p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/53894/files/20130904222207-PartsDiagram_calloutsBAD.png?1378358527"" src="""" style=""width: 553.41px; height: 267px;""/></em></p>
<p>You or your repairman plays this matching game every time with parts diagrams like the one above.  The diagram callout shows a little line pointing to the part you *think* its is pointing to, and then you must spend time trying to find the matching number or symbol on a separate list. Sometimes it takes an eternity to work the matching process the other way by finding the number in the list and then finding the right callout in the diagram.  It seems they never put them in the picture in any sort of correct order.  </p>
<p><strong>Mind Teasers</strong></p>
<p>Shopping should not be a mind teaser, but playing the matching game can sure feel like it.  These two questions below are typical of the kinds of problems to tackle when identifying a part.  No these are not trick questions, promise! Use the 2D picture above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is component that 2B523 callout is referring to pointing at the entire tube or just the connector in that tube?  </li>
<li>Does 2078 include the connection located where HM1 is supposed to go or is it only the lower portion?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions like these are asked of the employees at the parts counter all the time and it is frustrating for everyone waiting line.  We don't know the answers to these questions and neither did the parts person we asked.  His suggestion was that we order the parts with our credit card and then we would both know.  We said, ""No thank you!"" (By the way, did you notice there are two 2078  and two HM1 part numbers?)</p>
<p>That is not the way we want to do business and we highly suspect you don't either.  Good customer service would have just ordered them both for you but waiting and seeing is not very efficient either, for you or for the company you are ordering from.  And if it isn't the right one, everyone gets to start the process all over again.</p>
<p><strong>Part Numbers Not Required</strong></p>
<p>With our patented <em>3D Click-to-Buy(TM)</em> you simply click on the part you want and add it to your shopping cart. No more part numbers to jot down. No guesswork.  No more matching games.  Just a simple interface to locate the part you need.  If you need a part number for some reason, it will still be there, just in case.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are specifically looking for funds to work on a very focused portion of software development so that we can start taking on testers in our open alpha and beta programs.  So much work has already been completed, but there are a few hurdles remaining to tie all of the pieces together.  That is where you come in!  All of the work so far has been part time and self funded.  Working late at night (ok through to early in the morning) and it starts to get in the way of day jobs. We think it is time to make the switch to full time, but we need your help.<br/><br/>Many of the perk levels will be granted access to the alpha and beta programs prior to public launch.  This will give us some valuable feedback on where we can make improvements but more importantly it gives you the opportunity to shape the product.  We know there will be some bugs to squash during this time and so we will reward our customers with priority specials and discounts just for being there through the testing periods.  We probably will have a few t-shirts and other cool gadgets to give away too, but it all depends on you.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal then we will only be able to provide a smaller number of items and it will take much longer before they are available to everyone.  But if we exceed our goal then we will be able to offer a much wider range of items and be able to work on some of the other exciting applications that we have in store and do it much sooner.  We would really like to step this up even more.  If you already like what you see we think we have even more cool features to add, but we need your help to get the first part completed.</p>

Thank you!  Including the over $10,000 in purchases that needed to be done directly through our website, we have far exceeded our goal!!  Thank you!
Moving forward, we will also be donating an additional device for every $2500 raised either through device orders or donations. 
The Campaign

What if every scientist had access to the latest technology?  What could be accomplished?  We want to find out.
Through the non-profit Seeding Labs, ten Scientists with limited resources and from all over the world have requested our 
portable, DNA amplification platform called the Smart-DART Platform.  The Smart-DART Platform will expand the tools and methods available to these Scientists and will
 improve their research on topics such as food security or disease detection.


If we
meet our fundraising goal, we will be able to provide a Smart-DART Platform (Device, App, and Tablet) to TEN resource-limited scientists and jump start production for our newest devices.  
For every FOUR Smart-DART Devices purchased beyond our fundraising goal we will donate an additional Smart-DART Platform to a scientist identified by Seeding Labs.

The Smart-DART Platform is one of the only portable, real-time, DNA amplification technologies on the market.  The Platform is currently being used by researchers in numerous Federal agencies, universities, and private industry. 





It supports any isothermal amplification method and has been used successfully with the following amplification methods: LAMP (Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification), RPA (Recombinase Polyermase Amplification), and NEAR (Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction).  

Through this campaign we are offering for the first time our 3rd generation, Smart-DART

</p><p>We live on an
island where close to 100% of everything we eat, build with, wear and use is
imported. Molokai, like many islands, has had to contend with poor agricultural
choices, which have created erosion and denuded the soil, causing harm to reefs
and endangering traditional fishing areas. As we looked to address these
environmental concerns, we realized we could alleviate two unsustainable
problems with one giant bamboo! We are proposing to plant 17 acres of bamboo in
a watershed restoration area that will work as a carbon sink for greenhouse gas
emissions, hold soil, and bring down precipitation. By using structural bamboo,
we can address the issue of affordable housing on Molokai. Hawaii has the
highest cost of living in the United States, and Molokai has the highest cost
in the state.</p>
<p>We found a partner,
Rich Van Wellsheim, from Whispering Winds Bamboo on Maui. Whispering Winds has
been growing and processing bamboo for ten years, and Rich was working with a
young and innovative architect named Yuliya Bentcheva. Yuliya had designed a simple
strapping system that holds bamboo in place—a lovely, innovative, modular
design we are calling the Molokai Ohana House. It is small enough to be
affordable for tropical outdoor living, is a safe space against inclement
weather, has simple lines, is made of renewable material, and can all be grown
locally on Molokai.</p>
<p>Bamboo takes seven
years to grow before the first harvest, so to get us started we are hoping,
with your help, to purchase raw bamboo materials from Whispering Winds to build
our first prototype. Although much of the world already builds with bamboo, for
our island community it is a new concept. We want to initiate and introduce
bamboo to the island with a structure people can stand in, touch and see. Once
the structure is up, and people are able to interact with it, we are confident
the community will embrace this building material.</p>
<p>This is where you
the investor, and bamboo believer, can come in! We need the raw materials to
build this prototype, and for that we need your help. Our goal is to raise
$5,000 to purchase the raw materials and to cover any labor costs. </p>
<p>You will be on the
forefront of creating a sustainable model for rural economies around the world,
make possible the first affordable bamboo structure on the island, and
help us to further fine tune the design and cost. This design and “grow your
own house” concept could change the lives of thousands of families, providing
sustainable, affordable housing to the people who need it most.</p>
<p>We need at least
$7,000 for the first structure. We now have $2,000 from a grant, but as this is
the proto-type, we will not really understand the true cost of everything until
we build it. We will also be training local youth in the bamboo building
aspect; so some of the funds will be directed towards securing building tools.</p>
<p>Growing bamboo and
using it as a construction material will help to lower the carbon footprint of
those on the island. It will also help us create safe and secure housing for
keiki (children) and kupuna (elders) alike. </p>

<h3 class=""western"">Hi! We are Amy Yahna and Brian Musician of Alambria Springs Farm!</h3>
<p>10 years ago we moved to this beautiful land to build our off the grid timber-framed straw-bale home and establish an organic vegetable farm. For our farm operation to be successful it required building additional infrastructure, establishing markets, expanding our growing plots to meet those markets, and the knowledge to accomplish all of the above.  Now, we grow over 200 varieties of organic vegetables, herbs, and fruit using bio-dynamic and organic practices on 12 acres of land. Presently, we grow for our local community supported market share members, restaurants, colleges, and farmers markets. Recently, we have made a connection with a wholesale distributors in NYC. We are passionate about building our local economy an passionate about what we do!</p>
<p>Our passion to feed our surrounding communities healthy and nutritious foods led us to discover the benefits of fermented foods, most particularly sourdough breads. We then built a small earthen oven because the nutritional value of the sourdough breads are enhanced by the traditional baking environment of an earthen/masonry oven design. The response has been so great that we have outgrown our little earthen oven and we need to replace it with a larger masonry oven and support building to continue to meet the ever growing demand for our nutritious artisan sourdough breads. The many benefits of our bread baking are enjoyed by people living in over 5 counties in our surrounding area. By building our oven we will be helping to support the local farmers, millers, masons, carpenters, as well as provide nutritious food for our local communities. How supporting our project also has a larger impact is by helping to build grain production in the NE as an alternative to the mid-western grain belt. This also improves soil health when small grains are grown on farm land in a sustainable manner that would otherwise be used for corn, soybeans, etc. This encourages the local small sustainable farmer to choose small grains as an alternative. This stimulates the building of local mills that have the capacity to freshly mill small grains and alternative grains upon demand which leads to a greater variety of healthy flours available for local consumption. As this demonstrates our project multiples your contributions on many levels! This is community building, food security, and health all in one!</p>
<p>Initially, we thought we would grow the grains and mill them on the farm but recently discovered a local initiative already underway that has created a team of artisan crafters who are growing and milling the grains in the NE. Two members of this team include Elizabeth Dyke of Organic Growers Research and Information Sharing Network <a href=""http://www.ogrin.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ogrin.org</a> and Greg Mohl from Farmer Ground Flour <a href=""http://www.farmergroundflour.squarespace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.farmergroundflour.squarespace.com</a> and his supporting farmers.</p>
<p>Additionally, other members of our project team include John Sullivan and Sons Inc, the masons who will construct our masonry oven, Ron Jones of Ron Jones carpentry who will build the support building that will house the oven and additional work space.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""western"">Funding</h3>
<p>Our funding goal is $30,000 to complete our project. Your contributions will be used to construct a larger masonry ""white"" oven, a building to protect the oven and provide work space around the oven, additional butcher blocks, counter space, coolers, a large elliptical mixer, and other necessary baking supplies.</p>
<p>We have some exciting perks to offer our contributors! Our exciting perks include some of the following: recipes for your own sourdough loaves, donations to the local food bank, bags of freshly milled Farmer Ground Flour, your very own ""Bread Share"", personal invitation to our Farm to Table dinner, and a ""Bread of the Month"" club and more!</p>
<p>If for some reason that we do not reach our funding goal the money that we raise will be applied to the construction of a new ""black"" masonry oven. The traditional black oven is an oven where the burning chamber and baking chamber are one in the same and is less expensive to build. This is in contrast to the ""white"" oven where the burning chamber is separate from the baking chamber which allows for a continuous fire and uninterrupted baking session. We prefer the ""white"" oven design as it is a more efficient use of our resources(wood, time, and energy)!</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""western"">Additional Impacts</h3>
<p>Today the small family farm is in decline with more often than not one partner working off farm to help support the farm operation.</p>
<p>Our oven project will further diversify our income stream thus allowing both of us to continue to remain on the farm. And in turn will help keep Alambria Springs Farm viable into the future and help support and save a host of other small businesses in our area. This is rebuilding of America from the ""grain"" roots up, empowering people to take back their communities and their lives and to create abundance for all! This is true community building!</p>
<h3 class=""western"">Multiple Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to your financial contribution, we would ask you to please share our project with all of your contacts. You can use the ""share tools"" located on the Indiegogo site to help you do this.</p>
<p>If you are unable to make a financial contribution we like to ask you to pass this along to all of your contacts who may be able to do so at this time. In addition, you may wish to volunteer your time at Alambria Spring Farm this season. We are always excited to share our adventures with others who come with willing hearts and hands!</p>

<p>That’s our present situation at Greensations. We have one of the greatest products to hit the personal energy market since Red Bull. It’s Turbo Snort, the worlds’ first caffeine nasal spray. Turbo Snort uses naturally derived herbal extracts, caffeine and essential amino acids to provide instant lasting energy without the side effects of pills, shots or drinks.</p>
<p>Caffeine is the best proven drug for mental focus, but when you take too much – it actually works against you. You feel awake, but you’re unproductive because you can’t completely focus on anything. Turbo Snort delivers tiny doses of caffeine directly into the nervous system so you get all the good benefits of caffeine without the side effects.</p>
<p>Best of all it works for anyone at every level of caffeine sensitivity. If you’re not a big caffeine user, two squirts of Turbo Snort provides up to 5 hours of useable energy like a small cup of coffee. If you’re a big caffeine user, just snort more for a bigger boost. It’s basically a new way for everyone to get the right amount of energy for their personal needs.</p>
<p>Since we launched Turbo Snort earlier this year, it’s been growing fast, but we just can’t afford to advertise the way big companies do. Our goal is to run a direct response campaign to introduce Turbo Snort to the world, but we just can’t afford the kind of campaign it would take to make a real impact.</p>
<p>The plan is to start our big ad campaign on the Howard Stern Show on Sirus. Howard Stern gives the best bang for the buck when it comes to reaching a national audience these days. His radio show has a bigger audience than most well known national tv shows and his listeners are the perfect target group for Turbo Snort. Best of all, we can create some commercials that are really outside the box. It’s all about marketing where you’ll have the biggest impact and we know what to do. We just don’t have enough money to do it.</p>
<p>So we’re turning to you to help us achieve this dream. To show our gratitude for your donations we’re adding some cool perks. Along with our extreme thanks, we’re giving out free bottles of Turbo Snort and exclusive coupon codes to save up to 50% Off Turbo Snort at our website.</p>
<p>Check out our company, Greensations on the web and you’ll see that we’re for real. Our unique products are sold by hundreds of small retailers. We have grown from nothing to having four employees in just 24 months, but we just cannot break through to the next level. Several of our products have been featured on Dr. Oz, The Doctors and in the New York Times. We’re doing our part to help bring the economy back, and all we need is a little capital to start advertising.</p>
<p>We think Turbo Snort will become the next big thing, and you’ll be helping us create jobs to strengthen the American Dream that seems to have disappeared many of us. It’s time for people to back each other and help new entrepreneurs get their products to market. After all, it’s the entrepreneurs who will bring the world economy back into gear – not the giant corporations.</p>
<p>And as we like to say…don’t drink your energy – snort it with Turbo Snort.</p>

<div>Traditional vacuum cleaners with cords are heavy and not very user-friendly. But upgraded, cordless vacuum cleaners often aren't as powerful as their bigger counterparts.. After extensive work, Roidmi came up with its latest F8 Storm vacuum cleaner, a combination of powerful suction and lightweight construction.</div>

<p>Powered by an 100,000 rpm brushless DC motor,the Roidmi F8 Storm generates strong suction power. It's engineered to capture ingrained dirt and mess from carpets, crevices in the floor, and even mattresses. The digital motor generates up to 18,5KPa centrifugal air pressure, effectively removes the dust on the ground. </p>

What the media says about Roidmi F8 Storm








 

Traditional vacuum cleaners with cords are heavy and not very user-friendly. But upgraded, cordless vacuum cleaners often aren't as powerful as their bigger counterparts.. After extensive work, Roidmi came up with its latest F8 Storm vacuum cleaner, a combination of powerful suction and lightweight construction.
 
Installation Video for Roidmi F8 Storm


 
Powerful Suction


Powered by an 100,000 rpm brushless DC motor,the Roidmi F8 Storm generates strong suction power. It's engineered to capture ingrained dirt and mess from carpets, crevices in the floor, and even mattresses. The digital motor generates up to 18,5KPa centrifugal air pressure, effectively removes the dust on the ground. 
 
Award-winning Yet Simple Design


We use simplicity as a design concept to achieve an all-white attractive exterior while allowing the cleaner to remain lightweight and user-friendly. The 270-degree curved, large handle designed for easy gripping works with various cleaning heads for different tasks.
 
Long-lasting Battery 


A high-performance Samsung lithium battery provides up to 55 minutes of powerful suction while in standard mode, covering an estimated area of 350 square meters (3800 square feet). The battery can last up to 10 minutes while the vacuum is in max mode, giving enough operating power to deep-clean your home.  In addition, an intelligent power management system ensures the battery is used to its full capacity each time. 
 
Four-layer Filtration System


 
With its four-layer filtration system, the Roidmi F8 Storm intercepts hair, dust, allergens and dirt, resulting in cleaner air. The filtration system absorbs participles as small as PM0.3,  purifying up to 99% of your air.
 
Deals with Different Cleaning Tasks


With its variety of swappable cleaning heads and tools, the vacuum cleaner allows for easy adaptation to any kind of cleaning chore. Its unique self-driven cleaning function also makes cleaning effortless. The Roidmi F8 Storm has a built-in DC motor in the brush head, which transfers torque more efficiently, making for more powerful and deeper cleaning.

</h3></div>","WUUK is the most affordable and easiest to install smart video doorbell that lets you monitor your doorstep, see who’s there, and communicate with visitors. It’s a perfect mix of form and function elegantly designed around an advanced smart camera of 1536x1536 resolution, with AI facial recognition and IR night vision.WUUK gives your home or business 24 hour professional-level wireless security, reliability and convenience without hidden storage fees or expensive monthly subscriptions.  WUUK can be setup fast without the need for professional installation. Any homeowner can install WUUK easily, using mounting screws or double-sided tape. The doorbell can be wired in for power or simply run off the internal battery for up to 8 months. Because it works over Wi-Fi, no other wires are necessary.STEP 1STEP 2 WUUK detects motion when someone is at your door and sends you notification immediately with a 0.35s quick wake-up speed. You can open the camera to say hello, send a pre-recorded response or simply monitor the situation. With WUUK, you will know everything that is happening at your home’s door, instantly. When someone presses the doorbell you can receive a 1080p HD two-way video call via your smartphone. You will never miss a visitor again! Enjoy instant real-time communication with your visitor from anywhere. Or, if you are busy or it is an unsolicited visit, you may send a pre-recorded voice message of your choice.  WUUK helps you to see more with a 162 degree HDR camera of 1536x1536 resolution. This enables a wider view so more of your doorstep and property is visible, packages can be watched and you can see every visitor from head to toe. WUUK captures the image data of every person that stops by your door. You can browse all the faces that show up in your data history and label frequent visitors so that WUUK can recognize them the next time they visit using an advanced AI facial recognition algorithm.     Although it’s super easy to install WUUK it is difficult to tamper with. If anyone attempts to remove, disable, or sabotage the device, it will sound a loud siren alert to scare away the criminal. WUUK features an ultra-sensitive IR night vision capability with a 16 foot range. This advanced long-range infrared system lets you look deep into the night to monitor your property in low light or nighttime conditions.  Unlike other front door monitors, WUUK doesn’t have hidden fees for data storage or expensive monthly subscription charges. The system uses two methods of collecting video footage. The data can be stored locally using SD card storage or it can capture, record and store 48 hours’ worth of footage securely in cloud storage （2-day rolling footages）so valuable evidence is available in the event of an incident.*We also offer optional  Cloud Storage service for $3/month per camera for 7 days rolling footages. WiFi router too far from the doorbell? No problem! WUUK Doorbell has a built-in WiFi amplifier in the chime to extend your WiFi coverage. Enjoy the premium quality of images and two-way video & audio calls sent from the doorbell without worrying WiFi dropping.Plug-in standard outlets in any room of yours, you can hear security alerts even when you’re not near your smartphone.    SketchesWUUK PrototypeTooling Completed1st Round Trial ProductionWUUK Labs is founded by 4 cohorts who all spent years working in Silicon Valley’s tech companies.

We’re excited to introduce our latest innovation, Kepley K9™ Strategic Scent Stimulant, to the Indiegogo community and offer an exclusive chance to support shelter dogs in the process.</p><p>Most dog owners have experienced endless delays from dawdling and sniffing dogs despite pleading from the opposite end of the leash. Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant is designed to stimulate dog defecation by providing the organics and botanicals dogs search for when sniffing and searching during walks. Our groundwork shows that Kepley K9 helps dogs find these specific scents, which are disappearing in modern environments, allowing them to focus and complete the purpose of daily walks more quickly. Ultimately, this saves time for you, the dog owner, and reduces distractions and anxiety for the dogs as they perform this scent search. We call it the solution for the dawdling dog!</p><p>The Kepley team believes this patent-pending product can also play a vital role in orienting adopted dogs to their new human families. That is, the solution provides a plume of distinctly ""outdoor"" scents when allowing access to an appropriate location for the dog to confidently distinguish going outside from ""indoor"" space. Being able to clearly communicate expectations to a new canine family member could increase the rate of successful adoptions with fewer ""accidents"" that too often result in dogs being relinquished back to shelters.</p><p>But we can’t do it without your help. For this Indiegogo product launch, for every bottle of Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant purchased, we will donate a bottle to a shelter to accompany adopted dogs to help them adjust to their new homes even faster. You get to be one of the first to experience how Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant can save time and reduce anxiety with your own best friend, while helping adopted dogs adjust to their new homes even faster.</p><p>Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant can ensure more quality bonding time with your dog as your walks become less frustrating for the both of you. Together, we can help provide a better opportunity for shelter dogs to join their new forever homes with every bottle. It’s a win/win, like a karmic belly-rub!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559159933/pk9nspfbh25uf7qy1mnh.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557783600/jcc79bpcafdhabagwaui.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557783652/w36flohpfhicttmlarih.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We are preparing to launch Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant this summer, but we saw an opportunity to open initial sales on Indiegogo to allow backers to help us make product shelter donations with each bottle purchased for their own dog.</p><p>Every year, more than 3 million dogs find their way to shelters, where conditions often deprive them of the “outdoor” and natural scents dogs have characteristically “sniffed” throughout their evolution. It would follow that the absence of these scents – often replaced with strong disinfectants and kennel cleaning chemicals - could combine to diminish a dog’s ability to differentiate between indoor and outside spaces. For dogs that do find a home, one of the leading causes of relinquishment back to shelters is house soiling.</p><p>We believe our product can help humans orient their newly adopted rescues to clearly distinguish being indoors from being outside through our olfactory science. Simply placing a drop on the dog’s paw before going outside provides a specific plume of organics and botanicals that stimulate a dog’s olfactory and gastric systems. In short, it’s a backyard in a bottle that can reassure even an anxious rescue when given access to a safe, appropriate space for relief – lessening the risk of an indoor accident with every application.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557784951/ytxdstzjsho7o61u2tzl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>With every purchase, we will donate this product to shelters to help adopting owners orient their rescues to their new home.

The situation can be understandably exasperating, especially with busy work or school schedules, imminent bad weather, other things to do, or even if you just want to keep walking and enjoy your dog while getting some exercise for both of you. We’ve all been there, and it can be incredibly frustrating.</p><p>As trying as that is from the human viewpoint, imagine how the situation must be for your dog. They have a limited amount of time to find the perfect spot to go or risk remaining indoors all day until you can return. For a newly adopted rescue, one too many “accidents” could eventually risk heartbreaking choices and conflict among human family members along the way. But why do they deliberate so long before going? The answer lies in olfactory science.</p><p>In natural environments in every corner of the globe, there are the same organic and botanical molecules that settle on the ground and break down over time. These scents are instinctively recognized and sought by dogs as they sniff, and exposure to these scents help to stimulate their gastrointestinal chemistry needed to relax and relieve themselves. Unfortunately for dogs, in today’s modern society, these molecules are becoming less abundant with increasingly pristine community environments - and are virtually absent in indoor spaces. These dynamics can make the hunt for these scents longer and more arduous.</p><p>Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Solution offers an answer to the problem. We have identified these organic molecules and formulated them in a safe, easy-to-use solution that provides your dog with a plume of scents to satisfy their search. These ubiquitous yet specific molecules immediately focus and reassure the dog of being “outside” when given access to an appropriate location, typically “inspiring” the dog to rapidly relieve themselves after a normal period of indoor confinement after feeding and digestion.</p><p>The product is easily applied by placing a drop on the paw and allowing the dog access to the relief area or going on a walk.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557785238/cvrh1ma5b2pm7r5wud8l.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558993899/hmx9ejhfpkwesigdxwz9.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Want to know more?

We’re excited to introduce our latest innovation, Kepley K9™ Strategic Scent Stimulant, to the Indiegogo community and offer an exclusive chance to support shelter dogs in the process.Most dog owners have experienced endless delays from dawdling and sniffing dogs despite pleading from the opposite end of the leash. Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant is designed to stimulate dog defecation by providing the organics and botanicals dogs search for when sniffing and searching during walks. Our groundwork shows that Kepley K9 helps dogs find these specific scents, which are disappearing in modern environments, allowing them to focus and complete the purpose of daily walks more quickly. Ultimately, this saves time for you, the dog owner, and reduces distractions and anxiety for the dogs as they perform this scent search. We call it the solution for the dawdling dog!The Kepley team believes this patent-pending product can also play a vital role in orienting adopted dogs to their new human families. That is, the solution provides a plume of distinctly ""outdoor"" scents when allowing access to an appropriate location for the dog to confidently distinguish going outside from ""indoor"" space. Being able to clearly communicate expectations to a new canine family member could increase the rate of successful adoptions with fewer ""accidents"" that too often result in dogs being relinquished back to shelters.But we can’t do it without your help. For this Indiegogo product launch, for every bottle of Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant purchased, we will donate a bottle to a shelter to accompany adopted dogs to help them adjust to their new homes even faster. You get to be one of the first to experience how Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant can save time and reduce anxiety with your own best friend, while helping adopted dogs adjust to their new homes even faster.Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant can ensure more quality bonding time with your dog as your walks become less frustrating for the both of you. Together, we can help provide a better opportunity for shelter dogs to join their new forever homes with every bottle. It’s a win/win, like a karmic belly-rub!We are preparing to launch Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant this summer, but we saw an opportunity to open initial sales on Indiegogo to allow backers to help us make product shelter donations with each bottle purchased for their own dog.Every year, more than 3 million dogs find their way to shelters, where conditions often deprive them of the “outdoor” and natural scents dogs have characteristically “sniffed” throughout their evolution. It would follow that the absence of these scents – often replaced with strong disinfectants and kennel cleaning chemicals - could combine to diminish a dog’s ability to differentiate between indoor and outside spaces. For dogs that do find a home, one of the leading causes of relinquishment back to shelters is house soiling.We believe our product can help humans orient their newly adopted rescues to clearly distinguish being indoors from being outside through our olfactory science. Simply placing a drop on the dog’s paw before going outside provides a specific plume of organics and botanicals that stimulate a dog’s olfactory and gastric systems. In short, it’s a backyard in a bottle that can reassure even an anxious rescue when given access to a safe, appropriate space for relief – lessening the risk of an indoor accident with every application.With every purchase, we will donate this product to shelters to help adopting owners orient their rescues to their new home. Don’t have a dog but want to help out? That’s fine too, for every bottle you buy, we would send it along with the matching donation to support a second shelter adoption with each purchase.The Kepley BioSystems team has spent years researching olfactory cues in animals and their resulting behaviors through academically-driven field evaluations. We applied this same rigorous testing ethic to the development Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Stimulant, validating the product in a multitude of breeds and sizes of dogs, as well as environmental conditions.The results and findings of our testing has been published in the open-access Journal of Animal Health and Behavioural Sciences in the article, ""Olfactory Mediation of Canine Gastrointestinal Neurobiology"" (see more information below).As a dog owner, you’ve likely walked with your dog as they sniff, search, and meander until they finally find inspiration to relieve themselves. The situation can be understandably exasperating, especially with busy work or school schedules, imminent bad weather, other things to do, or even if you just want to keep walking and enjoy your dog while getting some exercise for both of you. We’ve all been there, and it can be incredibly frustrating.As trying as that is from the human viewpoint, imagine how the situation must be for your dog. They have a limited amount of time to find the perfect spot to go or risk remaining indoors all day until you can return. For a newly adopted rescue, one too many “accidents” could eventually risk heartbreaking choices and conflict among human family members along the way. But why do they deliberate so long before going? The answer lies in olfactory science.In natural environments in every corner of the globe, there are the same organic and botanical molecules that settle on the ground and break down over time. These scents are instinctively recognized and sought by dogs as they sniff, and exposure to these scents help to stimulate their gastrointestinal chemistry needed to relax and relieve themselves. Unfortunately for dogs, in today’s modern society, these molecules are becoming less abundant with increasingly pristine community environments - and are virtually absent in indoor spaces. These dynamics can make the hunt for these scents longer and more arduous.Kepley K9 Strategic Scent Solution offers an answer to the problem. We have identified these organic molecules and formulated them in a safe, easy-to-use solution that provides your dog with a plume of scents to satisfy their search. These ubiquitous yet specific molecules immediately focus and reassure the dog of being “outside” when given access to an appropriate location, typically “inspiring” the dog to rapidly relieve themselves after a normal period of indoor confinement after feeding and digestion.The product is easily applied by placing a drop on the paw and allowing the dog access to the relief area or going on a walk.Want to know more? The Kepley team has recently had their findings published in the Journal of Animal Health and Behavioural Science, an open-access peer-reviewed publication.

<p>Hi everyone, this is
Ghazanfer Hussain inventor of EZ-Roll holder. It is a one of a kind, versatile,
and easy-to-use paper towel holder. A
traditional paper towel roll sits only on a flat surface and is usually too
bulky to carry around for outdoor use. Other wall
mount holders are difficult to mount and move.
EZ-Roll holder is not only compact and light-weight, but also does not requires any tools for installation, making it easy to attach and move from one place to another. </p>

some fun stuff!! Love to grill and cook outdoors? EZ-Roll can be a great accessory. Think about it for a second, would you want to drill a paper towel
holder on your porch? I wouldn't! With EZ-Roll holder just attach it. And
then once you are done, remove and store it with the paper towel roll. ;-)</p>

</div></div>","Hi everyone, this is
Ghazanfer Hussain inventor of EZ-Roll holder. It is a one of a kind, versatile,
and easy-to-use paper towel holder. A
traditional paper towel roll sits only on a flat surface and is usually too
bulky to carry around for outdoor use. Other wall
mount holders are difficult to mount and move.
EZ-Roll holder is not only compact and light-weight, but also does not requires any tools for installation, making it easy to attach and move from one place to another. 




      


If you love the outdoors
and like camping, going to the beach, hunting, RVing, etc., then EZ-Roll Holder is a must
have for you.


                                   





                                         
If you have kids, then
the picture below will speak for itself...... as
you can see the driver as well as the passenger next to the driver
can access the paper towels when needed, no need to worry about
the roll falling down and getting dirty. 


                           



Taking kids to the park, yay !!! Parents always take snacks, drinks, and fruits for them to enjoy. But kids are kids, experts at making a mess and embarrassing parents with their clever ways. This is one way for them to come out clean from that situation, literally :o)
                                              


We were invited to a cup-cake/splash party at our kids friend's house. Things were wet, icing was
everywhere. But as you can see, the paper towel roll is clean and conveniently attached to the chair where kids can access it without
wasting paper towel sheets.


                             



Now let's talk about
some fun stuff!! Love to grill and cook outdoors? EZ-Roll can be a great accessory. Think about it for a second, would you want to drill a paper towel
holder on your porch? I wouldn't! With EZ-Roll holder just attach it. And
then once you are done, remove and store it with the paper towel roll. ;-)


                             
                             




If you are DIY kind of
person, here is a tool for your belt or cart. 

                  


The use cases for this product are endless. These are just few scenarios that I have demonstrated here. 



Currently we are making this product in my home, and my father is helping us with the manufacturing. We package them in a tube box, which is quite economical and customers seem to like it too. But now retailers want packaging which makes the product visible to their customers.
                                      

Therefore I designed plastic packaging as shown below:
             
This is what the final product will look like, packaged ready for store shelves. 
                   

                     







Here is where we need your help! The biggest challenge we are facing at this point is getting cash flow to invest in this project, after spending pretty much all our savings on developing the prototype, and paying for patent lawyer. Contribute to our campaign and you not only get this amazing product, but also help us pay for the mold and production cost for the first batch.

<h2>The HydroICE Solar Project</h2>
<p>As the price of energy continues to rise and we continue to experience changes in our climate, the problem has never been so obvious: The world is in dire need of a cheap, clean way to acquire energy. Day after day we’ve all heard that we need to be more responsible with the world which is our home, and day after day our shrinking wallets push us more quickly to action.</p>
<p>But we don’t need to waste your time telling you what you already know, so let’s skip to the important issue: What is the best way to solve this problem? To cut straight to the point, solar energy is the answer IF a truly affordable method of harnessing the sun’s energy can be produced, here’s why.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""It's gonna be a bright sun shiny day!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/229/426/3546a2a61e331cf26a5b2ad19b5d0691_large.png?1351280706"" src="""" style=""""/>It's gonna be a bright sun shiny day!</div>
<p><strong>The most consistent, reliable source of energy that our planet has is the sun.</strong> And lucky for us, it doesn’t turn off if we’re late paying the bills. It’s always there and it’s always<strong> free</strong>. But that doesn’t mean anything if you can’t make those warm rays turn the lights on at night, keep your food fresh, or warm your home when it’s cold outside.</p>
<p>The world has taken steps in the right direction; the photovoltaic panels that are on the market are nice, but the extreme cost has kept them from becoming widely implemented.  Even with the recent government incentives the cost has still been out of reach for the average private consumer or business. Large-scale thermal solar plants do a fine job but they are generally built far away from where we live, making maintenance of these plants a challenge.</p>
<p>There’s just something wrong with the fact that it’s so difficult to utilize what is otherwise free and abundant. To be frank, we hate that. We wanted to change the way solar energy is approached. And change it we have!</p>
<h3>HOW WE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM</h3>
<p>Our project started out small with just 2 “slightly eccentric” inventors: Matt Bellue, an Aerospace CNC Machinist/Programmer with a passion for exploring new inventions and making them real, and Ben Cooper, an engineer and dedicated inventor with extensive background in the sciences. With our experience, passion for inventing, dedication to an affordable clean energy solution, and a healthy dose of outside the box thinking, we knew we could solve this problem. And so we founded our company, Missouri Sustainable Energy.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Matt and Ben, dreaming up great things in the shop"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/229/433/d8116e6ade6e3ac36985a077adf0462f_large.png?1351280799"" src="""" style=""""/>Matt and Ben, dreaming up great things in the shop</div>
<p>We spent months just researching what other people had already done. What worked and what hadn’t. What showed promise and what flopped. We hemmed and we hawed, we even played “Pin-The-Solution-On-The-Solar-Donkey” (hmmm, hopefully we get a a few courtesy laughs for that one)  And after all that, we finally came up with something that nobody had ever thought of or tried.  Are you ready to hear about how we’re going to change the world?</p>
<p><strong>It all starts with a standard gasoline engine.</strong>  Yes, that’s right; we’re going to make a gasoline engine generate electricity by running it on solar power. Sound outrageous? Well, it might, but keep reading!</p>
<p>The principle in a gas/diesel engine is fairly simple:  Inject fuel into the engine, a spark is fired, an explosion occurs and as a result the piston moves, turning a generator, pushing a car, or driving whatever the engine is connected to.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/229/986/7223c9819f72fc82608e7f5525cff5e1_large.gif?1351298973"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Now here’s where we turn the world upside down. Take that same engine and modify the variables slightly; instead of injecting gas/diesel, inject hot oil (using mirrored parabolic solar collectors, temperatures of 800 degrees farenheit can be reached!) into the cylinder. Instead of a spark, add a few microdroplets of water. When the water contacts the hot oil, the oil’s thermal energy is transferred to the water and it instantly flashes to steam.</p>
<p><strong>When water changes from a liquid to a gas, it has the potential to increase it’s original volume by 3,000 times. </strong>It’s this powerful expansion that drives the engine.  Just connect a generator to the system and there you have it: An engine that only requires the warmth of the sun to produce electricity.</p>
<p>For just a quick second, let's consider something that is often overlooked: Safety.</p>
<p>Safety is A MAJOR problem associated with steam turbines and engines. Each of these devices require high-pressure steam that must be created outside of the system in a boiler before being injected into the device. Steam can be extremely deadly at these pressures and the slightest problem or leak could result in fatalities. This is an acceptable hazard when utilized at the utility level by trained professionals, but NOT among homes, business, and communities.</p>
<p><strong>Using the HydroICE method, the required steam is generated inside the engine where the work is being done. This eliminates the extreme hazard and makes it safe for use anywhere.</strong></p>
<p>So to summarize: A mirrored parabolic solar collector heats the oil, the hot oil is injected into the engine, and then a small burst of water is injected into the engine. When the water contacts the hot oil, it flashes to steam and expands which causes the engine to turn. The engine drives a generator which creates electricity, here's a diagram of the complete closed-loop system.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s155/potatoblaster/SYSTEM.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve had a few people ask to see an example of the oil/water reaction in action.  Check out the video gallery at the top of this page for an eye-popping example of what we’re talking about.</p>
<p>In all of our countless hours of research, we haven’t found anybody who has mentioned, let alone come close to trying this idea.  Why?  Who knows, but we finally did and that’s what matters most. </p>
<h3>USING THIS METHOD, IT’S FEASIBLE THAT WE COULD SEE THE COST OF SOLAR ENERGY DROP BY OVER 75%!</h3>
<p>Here's a cost comparison between the average cost to have a PV panel system installed versus a conservative projected installed cost of our new system.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s155/potatoblaster/comps.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For all of you extra-curious types, we also want to mention that the system will include an oil/steam separator because, as we all know, water and oil don’t mix. This technology has been around for a long time and will allow our system to run on a closed-loop, using the oil and water over and over again. That’s it. Not so outrageous after all!</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""HydroICE converted 31cc gas engine"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/229/580/ef481148048ab25f180e39b92b059a40_large.png?1351285099"" src="""" style=""""/>HydroICE converted 31cc gas engine</div>
<p>For our prototype system we engineered the conversion of a small, 31cc, 2-stroke engine that you would typically find in a weed-eater or other similar equipment.  Once we finished the design, Matt machined all of the parts necessary to make the modification.  Matt has asked that we don’t brag too much about him but he’s pretty darn good at what he does and in no time at all we had a finished prototype engine that was ready to be tested.  Below you will find a diagram from our patent on this new approach.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<p>The next step is pretty obvious: Let’s test this thing!  We started searching for a place to conduct the tests and presented the project to Dr. Steve Watkins, professor of Electrical Engineering and associate chair of the department at Missouri University of Science and Technology. We told him the story of our research, explained the concept and design we had come up with, and let him inspect the modified engine. Needless to say, he was extremely enthusiastic about the work we had done and with his help, we presented the task of conducting these tests to a number of students for their senior design projects.  The idea is moving forward and becoming a bigger reality each day!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/226/421/5da16e09c43ff77d47b26bc4c6eea018_large.png?1351124206"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>As it looks now, there will be 4 different senior design project teams working together to test the closed-cycle solar system. </p>
<ul>
<li>Team 1, from Mechanical Engineering at MS&amp;T, will design and create the infrastructure around the engine. This infrastructure will include pumps, piping, heat exchangers and the like. Once this is in place, we will be able to conduct all of our tests.</li>
<li>Team 2, from Electrical Engineering at MS&amp;T, will create the control and feedback system to operate and monitor the engine during the testing phase.</li>
<li>Team 3, from Electrical Engineering at MS&amp;T, will assemble the equipment that will actually measure the electrical output of our new system, telling us the efficiency of our setup and allowing us to calculate exact costs.</li>
<li>Team 4, from Electrical Engineering at Missouri State University, is designing and creating the modular mirrored solar collectors that will heat the oil to power the engine.</li>
</ul><p>With this level of expertise working on the project, we shall soon know how well this idea can help the world!</p>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOU</h3>
<p>This is where we need you, our fellow clean/solar energy enthusiasts, to play your part.  We’ve done the research, we’ve prototyped the engine, and we’ve secured the  manpower needed to make this a reality. We've reached our current point by funding the project out of our own pockets but unfortunately our pockets aren't quite deep enough to pay for all of the testing that is now necessary. We need your funding support to reach the next step.</p>
<p>Folks, we’re almost there! We’re asking for $70,000 which will allow us to get a FULL WORKING SOLAR SYSTEM into place and test it thoroughly. Of course, the more money we raise the better! Once we’ve shown the world a full working system, the work will continue toward making it available to people like you at an affordable cost worldwide.  Kits will be developed, plans will be offered, and complete systems will be available to you.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<p>Unfortunately, at this point in the project, we are not able to offer awesome perks like complete solar systems. We need to test everything before we are able to do that.  Rather, we are relying mostly on the eagerness of our fellow solar and clean energy enthusiasts to finally see a product like this become available on the market.</p>
<p>That is our biggest goal; making clean, affordable energy available to EVERYBODY!  And once those details are all ironed out, we’ll be back here on Indiegogo to make it available to you!</p>
<p>We’re hoping that by now everything has clicked and you’re realizing that this has the potential to be a true changing force in the sustainable energy market and that we’re the team to get it done. This is what our world needs, and we need your help to get there.  Please support this special project however you can financially and by spreading the word to family and friends.</p>
<p>Every dollar that you back us with and every person you tell our story to helps the world inch that much closer to finally having a clean energy answer. Don’t forget, if we don’t reach our $70,000 goal, we don’t receive any of your pledges.  PLEASE help us make sure we get there! Keep in mind, you can donate any amount you wish, you are not confined to the amounts set on the right side for the perks.  If you just wish to contribute and not receive any perks, you have that option at the bottom of the contribution page.</p>
<p>We can do this!  Help us make AFFORDABLE solar energy available to everybody as soon as possible by backing The HydroICE Solar Project today!</p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Challenges that we'll face and FAQ</span></h3>
<p>Because our solar system is mainly constructed from off-the-shelf components, there really aren't too many risks or challenges that we'll be facing. Thermodynamically speaking, the method that we will be using to create work is well founded.  With that said, there are two challenges that we'll be dealing with as we continue on:</p>
<p>The first is that we'll need to test a number of different oils to find one that has a reasonable life expectancy as used in our system.  This should not be too difficult, but if it does turn out to be an extensive challenge we'll be consulting with a chemist to explore our options. </p>
<p>The second is in regards to insulation of the engine.  It will be extremely important to make sure that as much thermal energy is contained within the engine to assure that it runs as efficiently as possible.  There are many different ways to accomplish this, we'll just have to find out which works best! </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Frequently Asked Questions</span></p>
<p><em><strong>1) How does your engine compare to Stirling engines and steam turbines?</strong></em> This is the question we get asked most often so we’ll answer it first! While all 3 methods have the ability to generate electricity from solar power, they each go about it in a slightly different way. As a result, each have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Efficiency: </em></span> Both steam turbines and Stirling engines are known to be quite efficient, typically falling around the 40% efficiency range. We won’t know exactly where our HydroICE technology will fall until testing is complete, but we’ll be able to reach at least 15% efficiency with projections falling closer to 30%.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Manufacturing and cost:</em></span> Both steam turbines and stirling engines are extremely precise machines and as a result, we see that reflected in the high price that it costs to manufacture and purchase one. This makes them economically feasible only for large industrial scale applications.</p>
<p><strong>In the end, it all boils down to the cost-per-watt of electricity generated. Even if you had an engine that was 90% efficient, it would not be a wise investment if the installed system cost you $1,000/Watt. Of course that is an absurd scenario, but it makes the issue very clear. Cost is what has prevented solar from becoming widely implemented and this is where HydroICE triumphs. Because we can take a very cheap engine and operate it for a low cost, we are able to make up for our lower efficiencies and provide a cost-effective way to generate electricity from solar power.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Safety:</em></span> People often overlook this factor, but safety is A MAJOR problem associated with steam turbines and engines. Each of these devices require high-pressure steam that must be created outside of the system in a boiler before being injected into the device. Steam can be extremely deadly at these pressures and the slightest problem or leak could result in fatalities. This is an acceptable hazard when utilized at the utility level by trained professionals, but NOT among homes, business, and communities. Using the HydroICE method, the required steam is generated inside the engine where the work is being done. This eliminates the extreme hazard and makes it safe for use anywhere.</p>
<p><strong><em>2) How is this any different from a standard piston steam engine?</em></strong> Modern steam engines face the same safety issue that we mentioned in the previous question: They require externally produced steam and this greatly increases the potential for failure or a problem.</p>
<p><strong><em>3) Why bother using the oil? Why not just heat the engine and make steam that way?</em></strong> People have actually done that in the past, but problems with contamination and engine durability arise. Steam is the gas form of water, and water accelerates oxidation (rust). With the introduction of oil as the heat carrier, not only is this problem solved, but so is the problem of keeping the engine well oiled and operational!</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Can you further explain the oil/steam separation process?</strong></em> Believe it or not, the ability to separate steam from oil or water from oil has been around for a very long time. The oil industry has to deal with this problem on a daily basis. Granted, our specific application is different, but the principles remain the same.</p>
<p>Something very important that must be clarified: We will not be separating WATER and oil, we will be separating STEAM and oil. Yes, it does make a difference. Because steam is a gas and oil is a liquid, separating the two is made much easier by the fact that they are in different phases. This makes it an issue of<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> distillation</a>, one that has been solved already.</p>
<p>This is achieved through a baffle system. As the steam/oil mixture passes through the baffles, the oil will have the tendency to adhere to the surface of the baffle and drop to the bottom of the separator column while the steam, being a gas, will merely pass through the baffles and up to the top of the column, leaving the oil behind.</p>
<p>Not only does the oil industry have this problem solved, but the early Stanely Steamer cars also used an<a href=""http://www.stanleymotorcarriage.com/735restoration/SteamOilSeparator/SeparatorDesign.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> oil/steam separator</a> to keep the oil from contaminating the steam supply. That's a technology that has been available to us for over 100 years!</p>
<p><strong><em>5) If your passion is making this technology available to everybody, why the patent?</em></strong> It’s no secret that progressive technologies have been stuck on a shelf and hidden because they have the disruptive power to change the path of the market. We realize that, and we want to avoid having that happen. We didn’t patent this to protect our greed and collect every penny possible from our innovation, we patented this to protect the technology. With the patent we have ultimate control in making sure that it DOES reach the marketplace and ultimately your hands.</p>
<p><strong><em>6) What happens at night when the sun goes down?</em></strong> This is a common question of all solar products and we’re no exception. Possibilities include: battery storage, thermal storage (storing excess hot oil to continue running at night, probably not very cost-effective for home applications), or a secondary heating capacity (heat the oil using a natural gas, wood, or other similar burner). We’ll continue this exploration as we further develop the system.</p>
<p><strong><em>7) Can you run a car or motorcycle with this technology?</em></strong> This is a bit further down the road but it’s definitely possible!</p>
<p><em><strong>8) Would you mind explaining what steam turbines and Stirling engines are?</strong></em> For those of you who are unfamiliar with the working principle behind each device, scroll down to the bottom of this page for quick explanation on each one.</p>
<p><em>a) Standard steam engine</em> This machine works by creating steam in a boiler and then injecting high-pressure steam into the engine cylinder, moving the piston. A special valve is then moved, allowing for the high-pressure steam to push on the back side of the cylinder, returning it to it’s original position and exhausting the used steam out into the air. This is why old steam engines needed to fill up with water at the station! <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine</a></p>
<p><em>b) Stirling engines</em> Created by Robert Stirling, this is a closed-cycle air engine that is currently being used in some industrial solar applications. It operates by heating a gas inside of cylinder and as it expands, the piston is moved. There is no combustion that takes place. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine</a></p>
<p><em>c) Steam turbines</em> 88% of The United States’ electricity is generated using modern steam turbines, they can be found in both coal and nuclear power plants. Very simply put, these work with a “waterwheel” principle. Steam is injected into the blades of the turbine which causes it to turn, much like you would see happening with a water wheel down on the stream. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_turbine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_turbine</a></p>

The HydroICE Solar Project
As the price of energy continues to rise and we continue to experience changes in our climate, the problem has never been so obvious: The world is in dire need of a cheap, clean way to acquire energy. Day after day we’ve all heard that we need to be more responsible with the world which is our home, and day after day our shrinking wallets push us more quickly to action.
But we don’t need to waste your time telling you what you already know, so let’s skip to the important issue: What is the best way to solve this problem? To cut straight to the point, solar energy is the answer IF a truly affordable method of harnessing the sun’s energy can be produced, here’s why.

It's gonna be a bright sun shiny day!
The most consistent, reliable source of energy that our planet has is the sun. And lucky for us, it doesn’t turn off if we’re late paying the bills. It’s always there and it’s always free. But that doesn’t mean anything if you can’t make those warm rays turn the lights on at night, keep your food fresh, or warm your home when it’s cold outside.
The world has taken steps in the right direction; the photovoltaic panels that are on the market are nice, but the extreme cost has kept them from becoming widely implemented.  Even with the recent government incentives the cost has still been out of reach for the average private consumer or business. Large-scale thermal solar plants do a fine job but they are generally built far away from where we live, making maintenance of these plants a challenge.
There’s just something wrong with the fact that it’s so difficult to utilize what is otherwise free and abundant. To be frank, we hate that. We wanted to change the way solar energy is approached. And change it we have!
HOW WE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM
Our project started out small with just 2 “slightly eccentric” inventors: Matt Bellue, an Aerospace CNC Machinist/Programmer with a passion for exploring new inventions and making them real, and Ben Cooper, an engineer and dedicated inventor with extensive background in the sciences. With our experience, passion for inventing, dedication to an affordable clean energy solution, and a healthy dose of outside the box thinking, we knew we could solve this problem. And so we founded our company, Missouri Sustainable Energy.

Matt and Ben, dreaming up great things in the shop
We spent months just researching what other people had already done. What worked and what hadn’t. What showed promise and what flopped. We hemmed and we hawed, we even played “Pin-The-Solution-On-The-Solar-Donkey” (hmmm, hopefully we get a a few courtesy laughs for that one)  And after all that, we finally came up with something that nobody had ever thought of or tried.  Are you ready to hear about how we’re going to change the world?
It all starts with a standard gasoline engine.  Yes, that’s right; we’re going to make a gasoline engine generate electricity by running it on solar power. Sound outrageous? Well, it might, but keep reading!
The principle in a gas/diesel engine is fairly simple:  Inject fuel into the engine, a spark is fired, an explosion occurs and as a result the piston moves, turning a generator, pushing a car, or driving whatever the engine is connected to.

Now here’s where we turn the world upside down. Take that same engine and modify the variables slightly; instead of injecting gas/diesel, inject hot oil (using mirrored parabolic solar collectors, temperatures of 800 degrees farenheit can be reached!) into the cylinder. Instead of a spark, add a few microdroplets of water. When the water contacts the hot oil, the oil’s thermal energy is transferred to the water and it instantly flashes to steam.
When water changes from a liquid to a gas, it has the potential to increase it’s original volume by 3,000 times. It’s this powerful expansion that drives the engine.  Just connect a generator to the system and there you have it: An engine that only requires the warmth of the sun to produce electricity.
For just a quick second, let's consider something that is often overlooked: Safety.
Safety is A MAJOR problem associated with steam turbines and engines. Each of these devices require high-pressure steam that must be created outside of the system in a boiler before being injected into the device. Steam can be extremely deadly at these pressures and the slightest problem or leak could result in fatalities. This is an acceptable hazard when utilized at the utility level by trained professionals, but NOT among homes, business, and communities.
Using the HydroICE method, the required steam is generated inside the engine where the work is being done. This eliminates the extreme hazard and makes it safe for use anywhere.
So to summarize: A mirrored parabolic solar collector heats the oil, the hot oil is injected into the engine, and then a small burst of water is injected into the engine. When the water contacts the hot oil, it flashes to steam and expands which causes the engine to turn. The engine drives a generator which creates electricity, here's a diagram of the complete closed-loop system.

 
We’ve had a few people ask to see an example of the oil/water reaction in action.  Check out the video gallery at the top of this page for an eye-popping example of what we’re talking about.
In all of our countless hours of research, we haven’t found anybody who has mentioned, let alone come close to trying this idea.  Why?  Who knows, but we finally did and that’s what matters most. 
USING THIS METHOD, IT’S FEASIBLE THAT WE COULD SEE THE COST OF SOLAR ENERGY DROP BY OVER 75%!
Here's a cost comparison between the average cost to have a PV panel system installed versus a conservative projected installed cost of our new system.

 
For all of you extra-curious types, we also want to mention that the system will include an oil/steam separator because, as we all know, water and oil don’t mix. This technology has been around for a long time and will allow our system to run on a closed-loop, using the oil and water over and over again. That’s it. Not so outrageous after all!

HydroICE converted 31cc gas engine
For our prototype system we engineered the conversion of a small, 31cc, 2-stroke engine that you would typically find in a weed-eater or other similar equipment.  Once we finished the design, Matt machined all of the parts necessary to make the modification.  Matt has asked that we don’t brag too much about him but he’s pretty darn good at what he does and in no time at all we had a finished prototype engine that was ready to be tested.  Below you will find a diagram from our patent on this new approach.

Patent Diagram
The next step is pretty obvious: Let’s test this thing!  We started searching for a place to conduct the tests and presented the project to Dr. Steve Watkins, professor of Electrical Engineering and associate chair of the department at Missouri University of Science and Technology. We told him the story of our research, explained the concept and design we had come up with, and let him inspect the modified engine. Needless to say, he was extremely enthusiastic about the work we had done and with his help, we presented the task of conducting these tests to a number of students for their senior design projects.  The idea is moving forward and becoming a bigger reality each day!

As it looks now, there will be 4 different senior design project teams working together to test the closed-cycle solar system. 

Team 1, from Mechanical Engineering at MS&T, will design and create the infrastructure around the engine. This infrastructure will include pumps, piping, heat exchangers and the like. Once this is in place, we will be able to conduct all of our tests.
Team 2, from Electrical Engineering at MS&T, will create the control and feedback system to operate and monitor the engine during the testing phase.
Team 3, from Electrical Engineering at MS&T, will assemble the equipment that will actually measure the electrical output of our new system, telling us the efficiency of our setup and allowing us to calculate exact costs.
Team 4, from Electrical Engineering at Missouri State University, is designing and creating the modular mirrored solar collectors that will heat the oil to power the engine.
With this level of expertise working on the project, we shall soon know how well this idea can help the world!
WHY WE NEED YOU
This is where we need you, our fellow clean/solar energy enthusiasts, to play your part.  We’ve done the research, we’ve prototyped the engine, and we’ve secured the  manpower needed to make this a reality. We've reached our current point by funding the project out of our own pockets but unfortunately our pockets aren't quite deep enough to pay for all of the testing that is now necessary. We need your funding support to reach the next step.
Folks, we’re almost there! We’re asking for $70,000 which will allow us to get a FULL WORKING SOLAR SYSTEM into place and test it thoroughly. Of course, the more money we raise the better! Once we’ve shown the world a full working system, the work will continue toward making it available to people like you at an affordable cost worldwide.  Kits will be developed, plans will be offered, and complete systems will be available to you.

Ben trying to lasso the sun... Or something like that
Unfortunately, at this point in the project, we are not able to offer awesome perks like complete solar systems. We need to test everything before we are able to do that.  Rather, we are relying mostly on the eagerness of our fellow solar and clean energy enthusiasts to finally see a product like this become available on the market.
That is our biggest goal; making clean, affordable energy available to EVERYBODY!  And once those details are all ironed out, we’ll be back here on Indiegogo to make it available to you!
We’re hoping that by now everything has clicked and you’re realizing that this has the potential to be a true changing force in the sustainable energy market and that we’re the team to get it done. This is what our world needs, and we need your help to get there.  Please support this special project however you can financially and by spreading the word to family and friends.
Every dollar that you back us with and every person you tell our story to helps the world inch that much closer to finally having a clean energy answer. Don’t forget, if we don’t reach our $70,000 goal, we don’t receive any of your pledges.  PLEASE help us make sure we get there! Keep in mind, you can donate any amount you wish, you are not confined to the amounts set on the right side for the perks.  If you just wish to contribute and not receive any perks, you have that option at the bottom of the contribution page.
We can do this!  Help us make AFFORDABLE solar energy available to everybody as soon as possible by backing The HydroICE Solar Project today!

Challenges that we'll face and FAQ
Because our solar system is mainly constructed from off-the-shelf components, there really aren't too many risks or challenges that we'll be facing. Thermodynamically speaking, the method that we will be using to create work is well founded.  With that said, there are two challenges that we'll be dealing with as we continue on:
The first is that we'll need to test a number of different oils to find one that has a reasonable life expectancy as used in our system.  This should not be too difficult, but if it does turn out to be an extensive challenge we'll be consulting with a chemist to explore our options. 
The second is in regards to insulation of the engine.  It will be extremely important to make sure that as much thermal energy is contained within the engine to assure that it runs as efficiently as possible.  There are many different ways to accomplish this, we'll just have to find out which works best!

Geodesic Earthworks is a start-up company that is pioneering a unique, custom-shell design innovation called the Geodesic Earthworks Kit: a novel, Earth-sheltered Dome Construction Technology that People NEED and the Planet can live with.
This is a novel means of enclosing space that is meant to SAVE, SAVE, SAVE!
This technology has just four major components.  These components are at various stages of completion.  We are looking to cover the remainder of the one-time manufacturing costs that will allow us to offer the public a Kit that can:

build for 50-70 cents on a dollar over conventional construction!

make heating and cooling bills disappear. These homes will be hugely energy-efficient and will NOT necessitate a significant future energy commitment!
 
re-establish the dream of enjoyable, attainable home ownership by offering this sensible and economical construction technology that will take both People and the Planet comfortably into the foreseeable future.
 
finish-off these rapidly assembling Kits into beautiful homes that are very GREEN, bright, airy, secure, and virtually maintenance-free.
 
take the best shot yet at ending the loss of life, limb and property caused by tornadoes and hurricanes. These structures will make ideal community shelters.
 
over time, creating thousands of jobs as people get to work implementing the new ""sustainable"" construction paradigm!
We simply add-in an age-old asset that got lost somewhere along the way… Good old Mother Earth…and the possibilities and implications become amazing!
The Geodesic Earthworks Kit (GEK) is a custom “shell” specifically designed to be earth-sheltered that rapidly constructs to give an interior dome shell surface that is finished upon assembly. This is a HUGE money-saver! The shell then has structural duties in that it is the concrete ""form"" that receives the exterior application of concrete that, when set-up and cured, easily supports the three-foot earth-cover that bestows so many benefits! The GEK is thought to be the only building system which has finished surfaces that go on to perform structural functions! 
Please visit www.domeanddirt.com for more information.

While there, take the Geodesic Earthworks Kit Home Virtual Tour on the Home Page. (And NO....the outside of the finished home will NOT look like that! We’re working on it).
 
Should this Campaign generate sufficient funds above and beyond those needed to complete this Kit, we will do two other things:
1) Begin construction of the model home for the world to visit and see first-hand what this novel construction technology is capable of producing, and
2) We will donate a Kit to a tornado ravaged area willing to help finish it into a community shelter for the people in that locale. This shelter can also serve as a model for other such communities that are in tornado and/or hurricane-prone areas.
Our Perks to you are: 
1)      Our Universal Hub Poster (11” x 17” --  See video) 
2)      Our Universal Hub (See video)
3)      3:1 Certificate Program.  Save on a Geodesic Earthworks Kit:
These Numbered Certificates will not expire and you can transfer them to family and friends!
           Now, down to the business of “Owning a Home the Planet can live with.""
4) Obtaining a Geodesic Earthworks Kit--be one of the first!!
Here you'll find two ways of purchasing a Geodesic Earthworks Kit at discounted prices.
1) Purchase an entire Geodesic Earthworks Kit during this Campaign at a 20% discount off the retail price of $25,000 for a price of $20,000.00. Complete building plans included and when it comes time to talk to you about the specifics of your Kit, you'll have to decide between one of three models.
or
2) Incrementally obtain a Geodesic Earthworks Kit at your own pace, as your personal situation dictates, package by package! Purchase one or more of these packages during this Campaign and receive a 10% discount toward your next Package! Total value of these discounts are about $2,300 and these prices will be frozen for you as you see them here. You'll see these packages listed as separate Perks. Complete building plans are included upon the purchase of your remaining Package.
If for any reason you decide you cannot receive either your Kit or a Package you have purchased, you will receive a full refund.
Shipping costs for Packages and the Geodesic Earthworks Kit (GEK)are the Purchaser's.
Remember, the GEK is a custom-shell product of struts, hubs, and panels that features a finished interior dome surface upon Kit assembly; but requires finishing-off. You will therefore have to add the spray covering of concrete, drainage, water-proofing and backfill; windows and doors, entryways, cupola if desired, etc. All said and done, we state that the cost of this building technology will come in at 50%-70% the cost of a “conventionally-built” home of similar size and appointment!
The Geodesic Earthworks Kit and all component “packages” come painted/ powder-coated and color-coded!
DISCLAIMER: In the video you'll see an open-ended earth-sheltered design that is just beautiful. This was not designed by us but is from one of two Colorado companies...I don't know which. It was included to show how fantastically attractive earth-sheltered dwellings can be...and this is one of the best I've seen! We will have an ""open-ended"" model as well. In placing that pic in the video we make no claim on its design or authorship whatsoever, and given where we found it, assume there is no copyright assoicated with it. That said, if the company that built it or the home's owner disapproves of it being there, it will be immediately removed.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what's going on.  Anything you can contribute, $1, $10, $50 will go directly to buying gifts for these keiki.  We will coordinate with the people at Ka Hale a Ke Ola to find out what type of gifts are needed, for what ages and genders, and deliver them to the children at their Gift exchange on the 22nd.  I know this is short notice, and even if we only can buy a couple gifts, it will really go a long way in helping these kids feel loved.</p>

<p>We have been working for more than a year developing Curvilux and getting it ready for production. We know that before mass production begins, we may encounter some problems. We have plans to mitigate all the risks and have enlisted great advisors even back up partners that will also help.</p>
<p><b>Manufacturing:</b></p>
<p>We need to create the tooling to manufacture different parts of the product, even special tools for the mounting line. This process is not very complex since our product was design to keep it simple, but requires time to get it just right. Complications could potentially emerge but to tackle this risk, we've selected experienced partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><b>Software:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The software and app are functional, but we still have work to do building all the features that we want to include in the Curvilux app. We have a lot of experience in this area but if necessary we will look for additional help to solve any problems that could emerge. </span></p>Our team is strong and counts with the capabilities to solve problems and overcome challenges, as we’ve done so far. Our goal is to make a high quality product for you and deliver it right on time.<p> </p>

Not only will you wake up fully recharged, your devices will as well.  We created a simple and elegant way to remove the clutter and cables and charge up to 3 devices at once through the wireless and USB chargers incorporated.  

 

Set the mood with your favorite music in every setting whether you’re relaxing, working or enjoying time with friends and family.  Have all of your devices fully charged no matter where you are. Curvilux makes any environment or situation more personalized, comfortable and sophisticated.
 

 


 
>>IMPROVED!
Now it's much simpler to assemble Curvilux, just put the legs together, then place the top over the magnets and it'll automatically hold it on place. 


 




Track your sleeping activity and make soft adjustments to your sunrise alarm in order to obtain a better rest, control your drawer lock and set time/distance automatic locking, manage not only the Curvilux lights but those in the rest of the room as well (feature coming soon).  Soon you’ll be able to integrate with additional smart home devices such as thermostats, personal assistant and more.
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 


We have been working on Curvilux for over a year now, and after several prototyping iterations and user feedback we now have our first fully-functional units. This gives us great confidence about the manufacturing process to come.
 
 
 
 
 
We believe that making life more natural and stylish is key to achieving the comfortable and modern home of the 21st century; that's why we’re proud to show our product to the amazing IndieGoGo community and invite you to be a part of this revolution. With your input and support we will be able to bring Curvilux to the world much more quickly. All design and components are on final test stages, and we will shortly be ready to commence production upon receiving your pre-orders. We will all make this happen together!

We have been working for more than a year developing Curvilux and getting it ready for production. We know that before mass production begins, we may encounter some problems. We have plans to mitigate all the risks and have enlisted great advisors even back up partners that will also help.
Manufacturing:
We need to create the tooling to manufacture different parts of the product, even special tools for the mounting line. This process is not very complex since our product was design to keep it simple, but requires time to get it just right. Complications could potentially emerge but to tackle this risk, we've selected experienced partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.
 
Software:
The software and app are functional, but we still have work to do building all the features that we want to include in the Curvilux app. We have a lot of experience in this area but if necessary we will look for additional help to solve any problems that could emerge. Our team is strong and counts with the capabilities to solve problems and overcome challenges, as we’ve done so far. Our goal is to make a high quality product for you and deliver it right on time.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Jeffrey is originally from Cape Town, South Africa. Bonnie is a New Yorker that grew up in Houston. We met in Los Angeles (on match.com!) in 2007. Here’s how we came to design this kit.</span></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/76295196"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Our first self-wedding
experience together happened soon after Bonnie’s mom passed away from cancer. Bonnie’s
birthday came a few months later and needless to say she didn’t feel much like
celebrating. A friend told us about her own self-wedding experience and it
seemed like just the right way to honor Bonnie’s mom by looking within. We also
wanted to bring healing into our community, many of whom were also going
through their own significant hardships—relationships on the rocks, the
economic downturn and illness. So we had a small self-wedding ceremony for all
of the party guests to ignite good, positive energy. It was such a loving,
powerful experience and it lifted everyone a little higher and made the path a
little easier. The impact has stayed with us to this day.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Fast forward and about 2 ½
years ago we had a backyard wedding BUT with a twist. The day, the occasion was
about celebration and love and we wanted our friends to feel what we were
feeling. So we wrote special vows for our friends and made 120 sterling silver
rings and after our ceremony was over, we married our guests to
themselves. The laughter, the love, the genuine surprise in some at it being
about them only, no one else was extraordinary. People who were there keep telling us even
now, ""I haven't taken my ring off since your wedding."" ""It holds
so much meaning for me!"", ""It reminds me every day that I'm
special.""</span></p>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">We've done 3 or 4 large and small ceremonies since then and it remains so very powerful and fulfilling that we decided
we wanted to keep spreading that feeling. Our dilemma was how to continue the
movement so we could impact the most people. It’s taken us a while
to figure out a sustainable model and here we are today. We think this is the
perfect way and we look forward to growing this idea to bigger celebrations in
as many places as possible.<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p></span><p></p>

<h3>WHY A SELF-WEDDING?</h3>
<ol>
<p></p>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">This is a live-like-you-mean-it moment that can be celebrated alone or with others who recognize the need for the love of self. We are, after all, fabulous!</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Because love is contagious.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Inner peace makes for more balanced citizens and more compassionate communities. Save the planet!</span></li>
<p></p>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">This is not about waiting for the “right one” to complete you. A self-wedding is about completing yourself. Loving yourself. Realizing YOU are the “right” one. The more you love yourself, the better able you are to love others. Divorce rates are high in marriage but we are sure you will be sleeping with the person you self-marry today for the rest of your life. ☺ </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">A self-wedding is a genuinely inspirational practice that reminds you, every day after, as you wear your ring, of the simplest thing you can do to make for a happier, more content life: LOVE YOURSELF. Come on, join us!!</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">A self-wedding is a refreshingly modern way

JOIN US IN THE SELF-WEDDING MOVEMENT!


OUR STORY


Jeffrey is originally from Cape Town, South Africa. Bonnie is a New Yorker that grew up in Houston. We met in Los Angeles (on match.com!) in 2007. Here’s how we came to design this kit.

Our first self-wedding
experience together happened soon after Bonnie’s mom passed away from cancer. Bonnie’s
birthday came a few months later and needless to say she didn’t feel much like
celebrating. A friend told us about her own self-wedding experience and it
seemed like just the right way to honor Bonnie’s mom by looking within. We also
wanted to bring healing into our community, many of whom were also going
through their own significant hardships—relationships on the rocks, the
economic downturn and illness. So we had a small self-wedding ceremony for all
of the party guests to ignite good, positive energy. It was such a loving,
powerful experience and it lifted everyone a little higher and made the path a
little easier. The impact has stayed with us to this day.



Fast forward and about 2 ½
years ago we had a backyard wedding BUT with a twist. The day, the occasion was
about celebration and love and we wanted our friends to feel what we were
feeling. So we wrote special vows for our friends and made 120 sterling silver
rings and after our ceremony was over, we married our guests to
themselves. The laughter, the love, the genuine surprise in some at it being
about them only, no one else was extraordinary. People who were there keep telling us even
now, ""I haven't taken my ring off since your wedding."" ""It holds
so much meaning for me!"", ""It reminds me every day that I'm
special.""
We've done 3 or 4 large and small ceremonies since then and it remains so very powerful and fulfilling that we decided
we wanted to keep spreading that feeling. Our dilemma was how to continue the
movement so we could impact the most people. It’s taken us a while
to figure out a sustainable model and here we are today. We think this is the
perfect way and we look forward to growing this idea to bigger celebrations in
as many places as possible.
                





WHY A SELF-WEDDING?



This is a live-like-you-mean-it moment that can be celebrated alone or with others who recognize the need for the love of self. We are, after all, fabulous!


Because love is contagious.

Inner peace makes for more balanced citizens and more compassionate communities. Save the planet!



THE IMPACT
This is not about waiting for the “right one” to complete you. A self-wedding is about completing yourself. Loving yourself. Realizing YOU are the “right” one. The more you love yourself, the better able you are to love others. Divorce rates are high in marriage but we are sure you will be sleeping with the person you self-marry today for the rest of your life. ☺ 
A self-wedding is a genuinely inspirational practice that reminds you, every day after, as you wear your ring, of the simplest thing you can do to make for a happier, more content life: LOVE YOURSELF. Come on, join us!!
SELF-WEDDING IN-A-BOX

We've created the I Married Me Self-Wedding In-A-Box™ so that we can spread love beyond our own community. To yours.
Our kit gives you the tools you need to celebrate your most
fabulous self. You can be single or in a relationship, you can have a
self-wedding for one, for you and your besty, for a group of friends, to
celebrate a birthday or special occasion, or officiate a self-wedding at your
own wedding to give the gift of self-love to all of your guests.
A self-wedding is a refreshingly modern way
to remind yourself of your own true gifts. Isn't it time to proclaim your
awesomeness?






Our delightful
package (all components will be made in Los Angeles, CA) comes complete with a hallmarked perfectly simple handcrafted super skinny sterling silver or 14K solid gold handcrafted ring designed by Jeffrey Levin. 
The kit also includes:
 


Ceremony Instructions
3 ""Promises To Me"" Vows
7 Affirmation Cards (one bold reminder of your awesomeness for every day of the week).


Jeffrey has been a
jewelry designer for over 30 years and he understands the potency of symbolism. It's how it makes you feel about yourself. Wear the ring to give yourself daily reminders that you are fabulous! 




WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET

Our plan is to manufacture 1,000s of I
Married Me Self-Wedding In-A-Box™ kits so that as the movement grows,
we'll all benefit.
In order to produce the various components, we need to order a minimum quantity for printing to keep the pricing low and make the kit affordable. We need to raise $10,000 for the first run! We know it's not thousands of kits but it's a first step and we'll get there or we'll stretch there with your help!
Buy in to the idea at the minimum perk and help us toward our goal, buy a kit, buy 100 kits. Join us in spreading self-love across the planet!
Please get the word out, make some noise and use the tools provided at the bottom of this page to push the message. You are awesome! We thank you. 
♥ Jeff & Bonnie

TEE SHIRT DESIGNS
Wear your affirmation! Two great designs to choose from.

<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cristiano654"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cristiano Lagares</a> and I am 26 years old. I came from Brazil in 1998 and grew up in Massachusetts. I'm a full time student, a full time worker and a full time husband. I do feel a bit of shame asking for help, however, I also believe that this cause and my wife's smile if this works will be worth anything in the world.</p>
<p>My goals in life are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life a righteous life</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make my wife happy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have 2 kids</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have a job I can make a career out of</strong></li>
<li><strong>Give my wife a wedding ceremony.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A Little About My Wife</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>My wife is <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rachel.deschaine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Lagares</a>. She comes from a humble family and lived in the same house for 27 years. She has 5 sisters, yes, <strong>5 sisters! </strong>Rachel loves photography, books and music. All her life, Rachel always <strong>dreamed of finding the right guy, having a beautiful proposal and having a beautiful wedding</strong>. </p>
<p>Rachel accomplished some of her chidlhood dreams. She found the right guy (statement taken from her, this is not self claimed :P), she had a meaningful and beautiful proposal, however, I wasn't able to provider her with the wedding she deserves. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>My Goal and Where this is going:</h2>
<p>Rachel and I got married on May, 2nd 2012 and we haven't had a ceremony or a honeymoon yet because I <em>simply can't afford to provide</em> for those.</p>
<p>Rachel, being the most understanding girl I'm yet to meet, put aside her ambitions and desires and married me even though I couldnt afford her a ceremony and our deserved time off together. </p>
<p>I'm hoping that this campaign will turn our life around even if only a little bit. My goal is to give Rachel at least the ceremony she deserves! ( I won't get into honeymoon, that's way over my budget)</p>
<h3><strong>What I have and what I need:</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Assuming I reach my goal ($2000) I will try my best to spread the funding into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the church premises for the wedding.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hire a photographer and a videographer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Order the cake.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rent space for the reception.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If I reach above my goal, the funds will be used to further my Wife's wedding experience by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arranging a ceremory.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arranging a honeymoon plan.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arranging a transportation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anything else that can be afforded.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have <strong>no plans</strong> on using the funds for anything else <em><strong>not related</strong></em> to this ceremony.</p>
<h3><strong>Money is not everything!</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>After experiencing terrible side effects from mainstream energy drinks, the founder of I'm-possible energy decided to do his own research. The result of this research was this: some of the most common ingredients in popular energy drinks are added to ""give natural energy"" but are actually ineffective in the amounts added. These ingredients were also the ingredients giving John nausea, a cloudy mind, jitters and grogginess. </p>
<p>While searching many stores for alternative energy drinks that didn't contain these ingredients, John could only find coffee and teas. Not being an avid coffee or tea drinker, John decided to take on the challenge of creating his own energy drink. With a plan to fulfill the needs of other energy lacking individuals by creating a no-nonsense beverage to meet their needs!</p>
<p> We are dedicated to providing consumers a great tasting energy drink without any of the side effects caused by some of the common ingredients added to energy drink companies. These companies want you to buy into their “magic potion” but we at I'm possible energy know you are smarter than that, we know you will value our product for its honesty. And we respect your opinion, that's why we are giving you exactly what you are looking for... a no-nonsense, pure energy drink! <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>About the drink:</strong></p>
<p>I'm-possible energy drink, is a functional beverage giving the consumer hours of energy, without the side effects of many mainstream energy drinks, by avoiding all of the added untested, possibly harmful supplements included to make a drink sell, NOT to make a drink more effective.</p>
<p>I'm-Possible Energy has done the research to find out exactly what works and what doesn't. That is why we are able to give consumers a drink that truly works and is healthy for them.  This is done by keeping the ingredients natural and maximizing the taste without adding tons of sugar and artificial flavorings!!! </p>
<p><strong>About the company: (Why I'm-Possible?)</strong></p>
<p>I'm-possible energy was named by our founder John Mawson, who was on a mission to prove to the world that he could start his business from a very early age (18) while only having a shoe-string budget. From hard work and an attitude that refused to fail, John was able to found I'm-Possible Energy drink. While still raising capital to have our drink mass-produced, I'm-Possible Energy is rapidly growing and attracting a great amount of attention!</p>
<p><strong>About our values and goals: </strong></p>
<p>Once John had proved to people that it was indeed possible for him to create his business with only a high school diploma, a low level income job and no initial start-up capital, John decided that it was time to start influencing other people to reach their full potential. John believed that this potential could be reached through hard work, a positive outlook and a dedication to find a solution to each challenge that happens on the way and of course with a willingness to keep going and never give up. Through years of studying psychology and struggling with anxiety and depression himself, John has researched into many organizations, and treatment methods, which lead to his curing in late 2012. This is why John is determined to work with only the best organizations that help people overcome anxiety and depression. Through doing this, John has contacted non-profit movements and is in the process of trying to establish partnerships, while still dedicated to donating a percentage of all profits towards them, even if gone unnoticed. We will also be working closely with psychologists and therapists to be able to give one on one therapy to those who need it, along with many successful life coaches to help those who need guidance in their lives to go out and fulfill their goals, dreams and ambitions. </p>

I'm-possible energy was named by our founder John Mawson, who was on a mission to prove to the world that he could start his business from a very early age (18) while only having a shoe-string budget. From hard work and an attitude that refused to fail, John was able to found I'm-Possible Energy drink. While still raising capital to have our drink mass-produced, I'm-Possible Energy is rapidly growing and attracting a great amount of attention!
About our values and goals: 
Once John had proved to people that it was indeed possible for him to create his business with only a high school diploma, a low level income job and no initial start-up capital, John decided that it was time to start influencing other people to reach their full potential. John believed that this potential could be reached through hard work, a positive outlook and a dedication to find a solution to each challenge that happens on the way and of course with a willingness to keep going and never give up. Through years of studying psychology and struggling with anxiety and depression himself, John has researched into many organizations, and treatment methods, which lead to his curing in late 2012. This is why John is determined to work with only the best organizations that help people overcome anxiety and depression. Through doing this, John has contacted non-profit movements and is in the process of trying to establish partnerships, while still dedicated to donating a percentage of all profits towards them, even if gone unnoticed. We will also be working closely with psychologists and therapists to be able to give one on one therapy to those who need it, along with many successful life coaches to help those who need guidance in their lives to go out and fulfill their goals, dreams and ambitions.

<p>We spent months studying the most popular sleep trainers on the market. Some clocks didn't have nearly enough features to justify their price. Others had feature overload with buttons and programs parents can't keep track of. Some had nonsensical design choices (i.e. blue light as the only night light color option - read <a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/how-blue-light-affects-kids-sleep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a> why blue light is detrimental to sleep health).  </p>
<p>And across the board? <strong>None of them focused on beautiful design.  </strong></p>
<p>So, we designed a beautiful kid's clock that strikes a <strong>perfect balance</strong> between features and usability.  </p>
<p>With MELLA, you get:  </p>
<p>1) features you'll actually use,  <br/>2) an easy-to-use interface (""set it and forget it""), <br/>3) at a reasonable price, <br/>4) in a beautiful package.</p>

<p>Two years ago, we had a thought: why aren't kid's electronics designed <strong>with the parent in mind</strong>? After all, parents are the ones buying the product!

<p>Our mission is to create beautiful, modern children's products <strong>even adults would want for themselves</strong>.

</div></div>","MELLA is the all-in-one children's clock and sleep trainer designed to keep your kid in bed longer. * Shown in Arctic Blue. See below for more colors!""This is a great gift for any parent with young children who constantly looks tired, AKA all of them."" - Mashable With MELLA, there's no need for multiple sleep aids anymore - MELLA has everything you need! Oh, and it's pretty darn cute too.Studies show that children do not fully understand the concept of time until around 8 years old. MELLA uses colors and facial expressions to teach your kid when it's time for bed and when it's okay to wake up. With MELLA, your kid can learn to stay in bed longer, giving you more sleep! Pretty awesome.When your kid sleeps, so does MELLA.Set the desired sleep time and every night, MELLA will go to sleep with your kid. MELLA sleeps through the night so your kid knows to stay in bed. MELLA introduces delayed gratification with the Play Period.Good things come to those who wait! Half an hour before the wake time, MELLA will display a playful expression and glow a yellow light. Teach your kid to play quietly and wait patiently until the light turns green!  
  
When MELLA turns green, it's time to wake up!
Set the desired wake time and MELLA will greet your kid with a smile and glow green. It's time to start the day!

 

We spent months studying the most popular sleep trainers on the market. Some clocks didn't have nearly enough features to justify their price. Others had feature overload with buttons and programs parents can't keep track of. Some had nonsensical design choices (i.e. blue light as the only night light color option - read HERE why blue light is detrimental to sleep health).  
And across the board? None of them focused on beautiful design.  
So, we designed a beautiful kid's clock that strikes a perfect balance between features and usability.  
With MELLA, you get:  
1) features you'll actually use,  2) an easy-to-use interface (""set it and forget it""), 3) at a reasonable price, 4) in a beautiful package.



5 Night Light Colors
Choose from five soft night light colors to keep the bedtime monsters at bay! 
 
3 Sleep Sound Options
Choose from three relaxing sleep sound options to help your kid fall asleep quickly: rain, white noise and ocean.  
Nap Timer
What about those midday naps, time outs and other play activities? MELLA's got you covered. MELLA has multiple duration options for all your countdown needs.  
Alarm Clock
If your kid needs help waking up, choose from three alarm sounds (with child-friendly, non-scary options!) to jump start the day.  




We're kicking off our campaign with three color options. MELLA is available in Arctic Blue, Blush Pink, Bright Purple, and our limited edition color, Kickstarter Green!  
Once we sell through our initial minimum order quantity of Kickstarter Green, we will NEVER offer this fun shade again so grab yours today!


Let's get down to it!




KELVIN was unlocked during our Kickstarter campaign as an add-on and now we're making it available at a discount on Indiegogo InDemand!

KELVIN is a color changing night light, room thermometer and room hygrometer.
KELVIN changes color depending on the temperature in the room - blue means that it is too cold, amber means it is just right, and red means it is too hot. KELVIN's default program is based around safer infant sleep guidelines.  
Additionally, to provide greater flexibility, you can customize KELVIN's temperature range setting based on your own preferences or your physician recommendations.

CLASSIC COOL & CRISP SHEET SET 
These sheets are 400TC 100% Cotton Percale woven for that cool, crisp 5-star hotel sleep every night. Percale is plain in weave and characterized by a matte finish and crisp hand. Just like your favorite crisp white shirt, percale sheets are a bedroom must-have, especially during the hot summer months. Our high-end cotton percale linens are light and invigorating yet incredibly soft. Percale fabric is lighter in weight and more breathable making it perfect for summertime or warmer climates.

Each sheet set includes one (1) fitted sheet, one (1) flat sheet and two (2) pillowcases. [Pre-Order IndieGoGo Special: One (1) four-piece sheet set ONLY $127]

LUXE SOFT & SMOOTH SHEET SET 
Made with the silky fibers of the eucalyptus tree, these 600TC MicroTencel sheets are futuristically luxurious and environmentally savvy. Tencel lyocell fibers are also gentle to the skin, with a silk like feel. The microscopic sufaces of the fibers are smoother than even Modal, Cotton and Wool. Soft, smooth, and extremely breathable, so there’s no need to sweat these sheets. Tencel moves moisture across the sheeting to where it will evaporate more quickly and not pool and cool interrupting R.E.M. sleeping patters, guaranteeing the BEST sleep of your life!

</div></div>","Create virtual remote controls of your favorite smart home products wherever you want for whatever you need. Want to make your coffee table a play button for Sonos? Or place an on/off button for your HUE lights right above your bed? Hayo can do that - it's like using the force for your home.
Smart Home Platforms We Support:

How Hayo Works

1. Scan Your Room
Place Hayo in a room where you would like to set up a virtual remote control. Hayo will then create a 3D image map of the room. 

2. Create Virtual Remote Controls
Using Hayo’s augmented reality app, create virtual remote controls on top of objects or right in thin air. Then connect them to your favorite connected home platforms and products. Our app will be available for IOS and Android. 

3. Start Using Hayo
Since Hayo is always sensing your movements and gestures, you can start using the remote controls right away. 
Create as many controls as you want.It's your house, you decide!

Hayo works best where you and your family spend the most time at home, usually the kitchen or living room.

You only need 1 Hayo per room,not one for each surface.

Our Technologyand Software Design
 
Hayo's performance is made possible by our suite of patented technology, software, and algorithms. Hayo sees and interprets space within its field of view thanks to advanced computer vision, which is used to reduce false positives and react only when a person interacts with the virtual remote controls or barriers. Any other motion outside this type of zone does not alter Hayo's behavior.
Most 3D spatial technologies scan a person's gestures and motion. Hayo takes the opposite approach: it scans your physical space and objects, taking action when a person comes in contact with that space or object in unique ways.   

Device Specifications


For Developers
We are looking forward to collaborating with developers to inspire new ways of unlocking and fostering creativity for all users across contexts.
We have built a complete open API kit that will be available to technologists and tinkerers shortly after launch. Please get in touch with us here: developers@hayo.io.

Timeline

 

Who We Are

In 2010, we found ourselves having a discussion with the lead designer of Minority Report’s interactive scenes and sequences. A few days later, we quit our jobs and started Space-Connect, the company behind Hayo.We are Hayo. We empower people to create amazing shared experiences that improve our lives, only limited by our imaginations. 

Risks and Challenges
We are a very passionate team who has devoted nearly six years of research and development solely into crafting an amazing product. During all these years, we have done our best to refine Hayo, and minimize the risks before this campaign, in all possible ways.
As we go through the logistics of manufacturing in large scale, there is always a possibility of unforeseen events that could impact on our production time-frame. If an issue arises, we will continue to be transparent to our supporter, and honor the quality and expectations set for Hayo.  

How You Can Help
We fundamentally believe that technology can improve our lives and make them more fun. Through the growth of spatial imaging, augmented reality, and connected home platforms, we believe there is an opportunity to activate this belief with our product.
Hayo is fully functional and ready for market. We are asking for your contribution to manufacture the device in large scale, and get them into your hands: our early adopters and developers.
From there we can make Hayo even better, and reach the people around the word.

For 2-1/2 years we have been designing and manufacturing lightweight towable campers, food carts, retail carts and novelty furniture reminiscent of the vintage travel trailer and the VW camper van of the late 60s.  
We have 5 product designs -- campers, food carts, mercantile carts, a dinky dub (a smaller version of the above), and Dub Dekor retro-styled furniture. The Dub Box design process starts with a new fiberglass mold.  We are not converting old VW’s.  Each Dub Box has the look of the great iconic van and the nostalgic feeling ones gets when something old is shiny and new again.  WHY IS DUB BOX USA ON INDIEGOGO?
We’ve overcome some big hurdles as most small start-ups do.  Dub Box USA needs additional funding to increase productivity and monthly output to meet our strong back log of orders.  


WHERE DOES YOUR CONTRIBUTION GO?
We are seeking your support to help us take the next step into making our shop more efficient and refine our design and building process so we can pass this on to our customers.   
Your support in these areas will really secure our sustainability for years to come.  
Funding would be targeted in the following areas:

Shop Equipment to increase our lean manufacturing process
Solid works Software and CAD design software 
Additional labor
Mold improvements to significantly reduce labor and production time
Showroom upgrades and samples
Website Development
Small inventory of “design ready” bodies for quick delivery





                               WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT DUB BOX USA?


We hope you can support our company so we can continue to design innovative trailers.  Supporting Dub Box USA has many tangible and significant benefits:
Dub Box USA currently employs 10 people. That means 10 people keep their job and another 10 unemployed people can get a job.  That’s 20 people, maybe more, that will be so grateful to be employed (their families too).    
When Dub Box USA production grows our vendors also benefit.  When we grow our vendors will have an up-tick in business. 
Dub Box USA encourages people to start mobile businesses and encourages existing businesses to expand.  This boosts local economies and has a positive affect on employment.    
Dub Box USA gets people and families outdoors, reducing stress, increasing physical activity and encouraging quality time together.

<p>Vivez vos rêves d’enfant en venant dormir dans  une cabane perchée, un tonneau, une maison de lutin ou encore dans la future cabane de Tarzan à la belle étoile … tout en participant au développement du Domaine de Poiseuil :  un site touristique déjà reconnu et bien implanté depuis 10 ans en Bourgogne du sud, à proximité des vignobles de Viré Clessé.</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe Robinet (précurseur de l’hébergement insolite en France)  et son équipe, souhaitent aller encore plus loin, en créant dans cette magnifique propriété centenaire, un véritable parc familial ludique et insolite.</p>
<blockquote>""Plus que jamais la clientèle est exigeante et recherche de la nouveauté et des activités sur place. Nous devons apporter le maximum de services et sans cesse innover : créer des activités ludiques, une restauration familiale adaptée à tous et orienter l'ensemble au plus près de la nature avec un confort adapté au tourisme d'aujourd'hui tout en anticipant les besoins futurs. Je ne manque pas d'idées et l'avenir est prometteur avec une croissance élevée et constante si l'on sait se remettre en question et être réactif.""</blockquote>

<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">DORMIR</h4>
<p>A cette nouvelle étape de son évolution, le Domaine de Poiseuil proposera de nouveaux hébergements insolites (tonneaux, roulottes artisanales, cabanes perchées ...), tous de conception originale en éco-construction, pour faire de ce lieu de détente un univers féerique. N'hésitez pas à faire un tour dans la Galerie photos !</p>
<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">BIEN ETRE</h4>
<p>Un véritable espace ""Spa, Bien être"" comprenant sauna, jacuzzi, hammam et douches fera son apparition dans une dépendance. De plus, pour aller toujours au plus près de l'insolite, nous installerons un Bain Nordique de 4 personnes chauffé au bois. </p>
<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">DETENTE</h4>
<p>Afin de séduire et fidéliser ses hôtes ainsi qu’une nouvelle
clientèle, le projet prévoit également un programme complet de nouvelles
activités, tant à l'intérieur du Domaine ( badminton, volley-ball, football, tir-à-l'arc, équitation, fléchettes,  promenade en VTT et à cheval, chasse au trésor, ...) qu'à l'extérieur (tour en montgolfière ou en hélicoptère, balade en calèche, parcours oenologique) grâce à des partenariats locaux. Nous prévoyons aussi de mettre en place une gamme de vélo à assistance électrique pour profiter des paysages sans effort !</p>
<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">NOS ENFANTS</h4>
<p>Le Domaine de Poiseuil, c'est aussi un lieu d'accueil et de divertissement pour les enfants. Poney, Mini ferme, Potager Bio et activités ludiques seront au rendez-vous. Ainsi, petits et grands pourront partager, ensemble, de merveilleux moments. Une envie soudaine de partir à l'aventure ? Une nouvelle chasse au trésor fera son apparition et vous permettra de vous rapprocher de vos enfants tout en vous amusant ! Et pour couronner le tout, un véritable espace jeux avec toboggans sera installé.</p>
<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">CONFORT</h4>
<p>Votre confort est notre priorité.
Nous avons donc décidé de créer des allées éclairées ainsi qu'un nouveau bloc sanitaire extérieur accessible pour les hébergements nature.
De plus, des voiturettes électriques seront à votre disposition et vous permettront de déplacer vos bagages entre le parking et votre logement.</p>
<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">NATURE</h4>
<p>Aujourd'hui plus que jamais, nous recherchons
à créer un véritable parc en harmonie avec la nature. C'est pour cela que nous
voulons agrandir les structures équestres déjà en place, et ainsi, permettre
l'accueil de nouveaux chevaux et poneys. Un potager bio sera aménagé et la mini
ferme, quant à elle, fera son grand retour. Nous avons aussi prévu de redonner vie à la mare.</p>

<h3>Le Domaine de Poiseuil</h3>
<p>Le Domaine de Poiseuil est un parc résidentiel et d'activités de 7 hectares possédant une capacité d'accueil de 67 personnes. Il comprend 6 cabanes perchées, 5 cabanes insolites, 4 gîtes et 5 chambres d'hôtes. Nous proposons de nombreuses activités classiques (VTT, ping-pong, babyfoot, piscine, jacuzzi, massages, etc...) et ludiques (équitation ou randonnées à cheval, ballades en calèche, initiation à la dégustation des vins) ainsi qu'un restaurant : ""La Rôtisserie"". De plus, un barbecue est à votre disposition. C'est aussi un lieu idéal de détente, de repos, mais également de découvertes culturelles. </p>
<p>Cette initiative s'inscrit dans une région à fort
potentiel touristique, historique, culturel et gastronomique, sans oublier une
importante fréquentation internationale générée par l'œnotourisme en Bourgogne
et Beaujolais.</p>

Jean-Christophe Robinet (a French unusual accommodation precursor) and his team wish to go one step beyond, bringing a real playful and exclusive family park in his centenary old magnificent property
"" More than ever, holiday customers look for novelties and every possible on the spot activity. We're now involved in a permanent innovative circle, and services development : leisure activities, well adapted facilities in harmony with nature. We must deal with our customers expectations, while anticipating their future needs.      "" I'm still full of ideas and very confident in our future, provided we keep on challenging ourselves and being reactive. ""J-C Robinet
Do you wish to discover more about our amazing projects ? Follow us into the very heart of our next plans …
Domaine de Poiseuil :welcome, here's your home
Together, let's build our dreams :
Let's join this unique place today, to help it reach its full potential !

SLEEPING
To meet our new expectations, we'll propose unveiled curious accommodations (barrels, horsedrawn trailers, unknown tree houses), all of original conception, making of Domaine de Poiseuil, more than ever, a magical refreshing universe. Please give a look to our photo gallery !
RELAXING
A complete well being space, including sauna, jacuzzi, hammam, massages, swimming pool and showers will take place in the park centre. Furthermore, to stick on unusual facilities, a wood heated 4 people Scandinavian Bath will become available.
ACTIVITIES
To seduce our faithfull customers, as well as our future ones, we also plan a new activities program. Taking place inside and outside the domain, you'll find :
- badminton- volleyball, soccer, archery, riding, darts, mountain bike and horse riding, treasure hunt- hot-air balloon or helicopter flight, carriage stroll, wine tasting sessions, thanks to local partnerships.
 Beside our regular bikes, you'll also find electric assisted ones, to discover our countryside landscapes effortlessly !
CHILDREN
Le Domaine de Poiseuil is naturally also a children reception and entertainment place. Ponies, a mini-farm, a bio kitchen garden and more playful activities will take place. This way, children and adults can share wonderful moments together. Do you feel a new desire for adventure ? A new treasure hunt will make its appearance and allow you to share more fun with your children. Last, but not least, a new playground will be settled.
COMFORT
Your comfort is our priority. All our paths will be lighted at night, and better toilet blocks will appear in the park.
Furthermore, electric small cars will be at your disposal to move your luggage, for example.
NATURE
Today, more than ever, we aim to create a special harmony with nature. Thus we'll enlarge our present horse riding structures, allowing more horses and ponies in. The bio kitchen garden and the mini-farm will complete this relation to our natural surroundings. The pond will also be set up, for our guests pleasure.

The Domaine de Poiseuil
The Domaine de Poiseuil is a 17 acres residential and leisure park,  offering a 67 residents capacity. Its present facilities include 6 tree houses, 5 unusual huts, 4 shelters and 5 guest houses, and many leisure equipments (mountain bikes, ping-pong, babyfoot, swimming pool, spa, massages, …). More activities will help you discover the Domaine’s unique surroundings (horse or poney riding, horse carriage tours, wine tasting initiations, …). In the park, facing the main guest house, you’ll even find a dedicated restaurant : La Rôtisserie. If you prefer cooking by yourself, a huge barbecue is at our guests free disposal.
Poiseuil is a perfect place to releave and take positive energy. It’s also the starting point of many cultural experiences. Southern Burgundy has a worldwide reputation for wines, gastronomy, charming and varying landscapes,as well as a rich historical background and european influence, specially through the nearby Cluny’s abbey and Ducs de Bourgogne. The now fast developing wine tourism trend also makes for our growing success, in a very distinctive and exclusive environment.

VERSION FRANCAISE
Un homme, des arbres, un rêve...
Vivez vos rêves d’enfant en venant dormir dans  une cabane perchée, un tonneau, une maison de lutin ou encore dans la future cabane de Tarzan à la belle étoile … tout en participant au développement du Domaine de Poiseuil :  un site touristique déjà reconnu et bien implanté depuis 10 ans en Bourgogne du sud, à proximité des vignobles de Viré Clessé.
Jean-Christophe Robinet (précurseur de l’hébergement insolite en France)  et son équipe, souhaitent aller encore plus loin, en créant dans cette magnifique propriété centenaire, un véritable parc familial ludique et insolite.
""Plus que jamais la clientèle est exigeante et recherche de la nouveauté et des activités sur place. Nous devons apporter le maximum de services et sans cesse innover : créer des activités ludiques, une restauration familiale adaptée à tous et orienter l'ensemble au plus près de la nature avec un confort adapté au tourisme d'aujourd'hui tout en anticipant les besoins futurs. Je ne manque pas d'idées et l'avenir est prometteur avec une croissance élevée et constante si l'on sait se remettre en question et être réactif.""
J-C Robinet
Vous voulez en savoir plus ? Alors je vous invite à lire la suite de notre aventure !
Bienvenue vous êtes chez vous
Ensemble construisons nos rêves !
Ensemble, aidons ce site somptueux à garder sa dynamique et à évoluer pour qu'il soit encore meilleur !

DORMIR
A cette nouvelle étape de son évolution, le Domaine de Poiseuil proposera de nouveaux hébergements insolites (tonneaux, roulottes artisanales, cabanes perchées ...), tous de conception originale en éco-construction, pour faire de ce lieu de détente un univers féerique. N'hésitez pas à faire un tour dans la Galerie photos !
BIEN ETRE
Un véritable espace ""Spa, Bien être"" comprenant sauna, jacuzzi, hammam et douches fera son apparition dans une dépendance. De plus, pour aller toujours au plus près de l'insolite, nous installerons un Bain Nordique de 4 personnes chauffé au bois. 
DETENTE
Afin de séduire et fidéliser ses hôtes ainsi qu’une nouvelle
clientèle, le projet prévoit également un programme complet de nouvelles
activités, tant à l'intérieur du Domaine ( badminton, volley-ball, football, tir-à-l'arc, équitation, fléchettes,  promenade en VTT et à cheval, chasse au trésor, ...) qu'à l'extérieur (tour en montgolfière ou en hélicoptère, balade en calèche, parcours oenologique) grâce à des partenariats locaux. Nous prévoyons aussi de mettre en place une gamme de vélo à assistance électrique pour profiter des paysages sans effort !
NOS ENFANTS
Le Domaine de Poiseuil, c'est aussi un lieu d'accueil et de divertissement pour les enfants. Poney, Mini ferme, Potager Bio et activités ludiques seront au rendez-vous. Ainsi, petits et grands pourront partager, ensemble, de merveilleux moments. Une envie soudaine de partir à l'aventure ? Une nouvelle chasse au trésor fera son apparition et vous permettra de vous rapprocher de vos enfants tout en vous amusant ! Et pour couronner le tout, un véritable espace jeux avec toboggans sera installé.
CONFORT
Votre confort est notre priorité.
Nous avons donc décidé de créer des allées éclairées ainsi qu'un nouveau bloc sanitaire extérieur accessible pour les hébergements nature.
De plus, des voiturettes électriques seront à votre disposition et vous permettront de déplacer vos bagages entre le parking et votre logement.
NATURE
Aujourd'hui plus que jamais, nous recherchons
à créer un véritable parc en harmonie avec la nature. C'est pour cela que nous
voulons agrandir les structures équestres déjà en place, et ainsi, permettre
l'accueil de nouveaux chevaux et poneys. Un potager bio sera aménagé et la mini
ferme, quant à elle, fera son grand retour. Nous avons aussi prévu de redonner vie à la mare.


Le Domaine de Poiseuil
Le Domaine de Poiseuil est un parc résidentiel et d'activités de 7 hectares possédant une capacité d'accueil de 67 personnes. Il comprend 6 cabanes perchées, 5 cabanes insolites, 4 gîtes et 5 chambres d'hôtes. Nous proposons de nombreuses activités classiques (VTT, ping-pong, babyfoot, piscine, jacuzzi, massages, etc...) et ludiques (équitation ou randonnées à cheval, ballades en calèche, initiation à la dégustation des vins) ainsi qu'un restaurant : ""La Rôtisserie"". De plus, un barbecue est à votre disposition. C'est aussi un lieu idéal de détente, de repos, mais également de découvertes culturelles. 
Cette initiative s'inscrit dans une région à fort
potentiel touristique, historique, culturel et gastronomique, sans oublier une
importante fréquentation internationale générée par l'œnotourisme en Bourgogne
et Beaujolais.
A quoi vont servir mes contributions ?
""Contribuez aujourd'hui pour rêver demain""
Compte tenu des évolutions touristiques et de la demande, une nouvelle orientation s'impose :

Plus de services personnalisés
Plus de confort



Le budget de réalisation d'un tel projet est important. Aujourd'hui, notre besoin de financement complémentaire est certe significatif, mais atteignable. Les fonds que nous récolterons par le biais d'Indiegogo, vos dons, seront tout simplement alloués à l'amélioration et au développement du Domaine de Poiseuil.
Dans le cadre du projet, les travaux ont un coût de 412.000 € (545.000 $). Cette somme tient compte du coût total des nouvelles cabanes (construction + mise en place) ainsi que des rénovations et autres aménagements nécessaires. Nous pouvons d'ores et déjà vous annoncer que le conseil général de Saône et Loire et la Région Bourgogne soutiennent notre projet, et nous ont accordé une subvention totale de 105.000 € (139.000 $).
En fixant un palier initial à 150.000 € (200.000$), nous vous proposons tout simplement de contribuer au développement d'un véritable village familial de loisirs et de détente. Ce village, au plus près de la nature, sera le votre ! 

Vous l'aurez compris, en participant au financement participatif du projet du Domaine de Poiseuil, vous ferez de ce site un endroit qui vous ressemble. Vivez de l'intérieur ce projet unique !

Vous pouvez également privatiser le domaine pour quelques jours par an afin d'organiser vos manifestations et vos événements. Veuillez nous contacter pour plus d'informations.
Et si on dépasse ?
Atteindre 150.000 € serait formidable. Cela nous permettrait de voir le grand intérêt que vous portez à notre projet et ne pourrait que nous réchauffer le coeur.
Obtenir un financement accru - jusqu'à 300.000 € - reviendrait à couvrir totalement les dépenses engagées pour les améliorations 2015. Nous pouvons vous l'assurer, il y a tant de choses à créer et d'idées à réaliser, qu'aucun don ne sera gaspillé inutilement ! Nous pourrions, par exemple, construire et installer la Cabane de Max (voir photos galerie).

<b>---- Technology ----</b></span></div>","Short Summary
Priza Technologies Inc is working on harnessing the Z Point Energy , which is going to revolutionize the world. We have been working on it for 18 years privately. My earlier job was as a computer scientist at Adobe System Inc but I left that to pursue it full time.
I need your support to take it to the market from the lab. If I am not bound by the VCs to extract biggest profit from it, I can bring it to the market very fast and at a very low cost.
---- Company ----
 Priza Technologies Inc is a Delaware ""C"" corporation and we have been doing projects to fund it. Check our website http://www.prizatech.com for the details. Our company is in good standing since its inception.
---- Technology ----
Z Point Energy  is
 a breakthrough technology from Priza Technologies in energy domain by 
which energy can be created by extracting usable energy from the zero 
point vacuum.
 Z Point Energy technology
 is poised to have a momentous impact on the energy scenario of
the world because it enables the generation of sustainable, infinite and
 anywhere of electrical energy in an most environment friendly way. It enables
 fuel free automobiles, very low space travel, self-charging mobile 
phones and many more  things limited only by the imagination of the 
people using it.
---- Team ----

Shalender Singh is the President and the CEO of the company and has been working on the technology for last 18 years. Other than this he has also done research in various other 
domains, one notable of them being on design of nano-self generating 
robots: http://www.nrc.org/Nanotech2003/showabstract.html?absno=105. Shalender along with Vishnupriya Singh are the inventors of the Z Point Energy technology. 
We have invested all of our money and career opportunities to it (Shalender & Vishnupriya are both software and computer vision specialist). We have extremely encouraging results from our lab experiments but our technology needs a lot of money to be production ready. 
Z Point Energy success will have an bigger an impact on mankind than the industrial revolution. imagine being able to have space travel at very cost or being able to send signals into the past? We need as much fund as possible and kindly invest into your future by contributing to this project.




Use of funds

For hiring and paying staff for experiments and R&D: $4 Million for next 24 months.
For buying test equipment and doing in-house semiconductor: $2 Million.
For making production ready power plant prototype: $4 Million.


What You Get


The contributors are given membership levels as per the contribution and put into our roll of honor.
Members will get exclusive passes to seminars whenever they are conducted. For example once the sending past technology is ready, they will get exclusive passes to the live demo event!

The technology will take a few years to stand up and roll so there in no instant gratification but when the technology is commercially ready, members will get unique offers, limited edition equipments, power plants, cars or space travel as and when available.
These funds are contribution to technology and our better future.




The Impact

Z Point Energy technology
 removes the notion of constrains and finiteness of available energy 
thus enabling mankind to use as much energy as required for the comfort 
and betterment of life. This technology will help reversing the global warming thus saving world from looming and impending danger of rising sea levels. This technology gives better control of life to human being without constraining them.
Z Point Energy is also very important for the people and 
areas of the world which do not have access to adequate electric energy 
or cannot pay for it thus living in a sub-standard living conditions.
Z Point Energy will enables
 fuel free automobiles, very low space travel, self-charging mobile 
phones and many more things limited only by the imagination of the 
people using it.
A by-product of the  technology
 is the cooling energy, which can be transported over long distances 
through electric wires. Thus a new business case of “cooling 
transmission lines” using existing power distribution infrastructure 
will be developed along those lines. It can enable energy efficient very
 low cost space travel.


Other Ways You Can Help

This year, in 2015, we want to make all this awesomeness happen again, but we need your help!</p>
<h2><b>£500 minimum, £800 ideal.</b></h2>
<p>We need a minimum of £500 to make the pool happen. A bit extra will ensure that we can stay open all week.</p>
<p>Mostly we need money for the most basic thing: water. Getting water to the desert is no trivial task and we need 10 tonnes of the stuff for one fill of our huge pool! Our target of £500 is the absolute minimum to give us one fill. Although we improve our filters every year, we know from experience that keeping our poolwater free of dust is a monumentally challenging task, even for our £1500 cleaning system! We've made improvements again this year but £800 would enable us to change our water halfway through the festival and guarantee we can stay open for the full duration! </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What should I buy?</h2>
<p>Do you want a small home server that can do USB 3.0, has a gigabit connection to your LAN and is well supported in Linux? Buy <strong>MOX: Start</strong>!</p>
<p>Do you have an Ethernet cable with internet connection and you need just Wi-Fi in your flat? You can start by buying <strong>MOX: Start + Wi-Fi Upgrade</strong>! Gets the job done and when you need both bands, upgrade it with <i>MOX B</i> <strong>+ Wi-Fi mPCIe Upgrade</strong>. This way, you'll basically end up with the dualband solution we have for discounted price in our perks already - <strong>MOX: Power Wi-Fi</strong> set.</p>
<p>Is your infrastructure already set up and all you want is extra protection provided by dynamic firewall, automatic updates and Pakon network monitoring? Buy <strong>MOX: Start</strong> together with either <i>MOX D</i> if you have fiber to your home or <i>MOX C</i> if you have just plain old RJ-45.</p>
<p>Do you want something like Omnia, but you don't need all it's power and have too many devices on the wire? Buy the <strong>MOX: Classic</strong> and add <i>MOX E</i> and maybe later, when you get more devices, you can add another one.</p>
<p>If you already have Omnia and large place to cover, <strong>MOX: Power WiFi</strong> is here to help!  You can simply connect and pair it to your Omnia. It will automatically extend your Wi-Fi, getting updates and all the configuration from your Omnia. Totally automatic, disk-less and you would need to manage just your Omnia. Not sure whether you need both bands right now? Start with <i>MOX: Start + Wi-Fi Upgrade</i> and extend it later!</p>
<p>That is the power of modularity! You can buy whatever suits your current needs and extend it later! You can start with small router but extend it up to 24 Ethernet ports (3× <i>MOX E</i>) and two Wi-Fis based on your real needs!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can I mix and match the modules?</strong><br/>You must have MOX A (Basic) module in any set. You can have only one module of each kind in the set, with exception of MOX E (Super Extension) module. Most of the modules terminate some bus which is the limitation. MOX C (Ethernet) and MOX D (SFP) terminate SGMII interface, so it means you cannot have MOX C and MOX D together. Similarly MOX B (Extension) and MOX F (USB) terminate PCIe so those can't be together either. Exception is MOX E which it is able to pass-through SGMII signal - that means you can use it with MOX D module, MOX C module or even with another MOX E module. But there is also a limit - you can't have more than three switches in total so either 2 x E + 1 x C (20 Ethernet ports) or 3 x E (24 Ethernet ports) is a maximum. The last exception is newest MOX G (Super Extension) module which it is able to pass-through PCIe signal - that means you can use it either with MOX B (Extension) module or with MOX F (USB). To validate a particular set considered, try our <a href=""http://mox-configurator.turris.cz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MOX configurator</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We are a company  of developers and designers specialised to develop and produce outstanding products made from Titanium. We do work mostly only with this material, so we have achieved major innovations over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>The 'Nature Series' cookware is the result of ten years of research and is made of microcrystalline titanium. This kind of nontoxic metallic material is used by the developers as it promises more health and safety. The kitchen tools are easy to clean thanks to the specific characteristics of their surface. Furthermore, adhesion of food molecules is effectively and sustainably reduced because of the anti-adhesive qualities of the titanium.  </p>

<p>As the key technology of the product, the Microcrystalline titanium has unique hardening characteristics, providing a non scratch surface which is easy to clean.  Furthermore, the adhesion of food molecules can be reduced effectively because it features a fine and rolling texture.  So it serves several advantages compared to non-stick coating pans on the market.</p>

We are a company  of developers and designers specialised to develop and produce outstanding products made from Titanium. We do work mostly only with this material, so we have achieved major innovations over the past 15 years.
The 'Nature Series' cookware is the result of ten years of research and is made of microcrystalline titanium. This kind of nontoxic metallic material is used by the developers as it promises more health and safety. The kitchen tools are easy to clean thanks to the specific characteristics of their surface. Furthermore, adhesion of food molecules is effectively and sustainably reduced because of the anti-adhesive qualities of the titanium.  








 
Titanium is known for its unique characteristics to be harmless to the human body! Therefore it is even often used in the medical field.
 

It keeps the taste and characteristics of food original and does not influence its authentic taste. 

As the key technology of the product, the Microcrystalline titanium has unique hardening characteristics, providing a non scratch surface which is easy to clean.  Furthermore, the adhesion of food molecules can be reduced effectively because it features a fine and rolling texture.  So it serves several advantages compared to non-stick coating pans on the market.

The result is a huge improvement in your overall viewing and gaming experience.The Lightpack 2 now works with any TV screen and only requires just a power source and an HDMI connection. Lightpack 2 also can be used as an intelligent lighting system, even when your TV is off. You can set up the mood light with Lightpack App.Pixels are extending your screen to the entire room, so you are in the very center of your media entertainment.

And only when the battery is off you'll need to put Pixels to the charging station.Lightpack 2 analyzes the input video that feeds to your TV - whether it’s a movie or the game - and lights up the entire room with corresponding colors.The signal is captured and processed by Lightpack 2 in real time, then fed to the TV in its original form. Our unique processing algorithms capture pixel areas along the image border to determine the median color of each of these areas. These colors are then transmitted to the respective LED modules on the back of the TV screen. The LED strips illuminate the wall behind the TV, making the colors pop out beyond the border of the screen and smoothing out the gradient between the luminance of the image and darkness of the room. This gradient makes the overall experience easier on the eyes while giving the illusion of a larger picture.Frequently Asked Questions It takes 10 minutes or so to set up everything and connect your HDMI devices (HD-player, XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo WiiU, Roku, Chromecast, Apple TV, PC, Mac, etc.) to Lightpack.We want you to get the most from your screen, whatever one you have, yet we don’t want you to struggle with complicated settings and stuff.So we made SmartCorners. these little thingies is what helps Lightpack 2 to know what size is your screen is.Take the LED ribbon which comes with Lightpack 2, cut and stick it on each side of your TV from the back, mount the SmartCorners and you are all set.To allow you to manage your environment and control the inputs, we’ve developed a mobile app. It’s available for iOS and Android, and with it you can switch HDMI inputs, select a dream for the Moodlight mode, and more.Remember how as kids, we were told not to sit up close to the TV at night because watching it in the darkness was harmful for the eyes? It was such a great way to completely immerse in what was going on on the screen!When the screen is the only source of light in a dark room, rapidly changing between dimly and brightly lit scenes makes your pupils constantly change size, ranging between often between 1 and 8 mm. It takes them about 5 seconds to contract, and up to 5 minutes to expand once it gets darker. That makes your extraocular muscles work extra hard, possibly leading to vision problems.Ambient backlight levels out the intensity of light in your room by reducing or completely eliminating the difference in overall brightness of the environment between dark and bright scenes - as shown by Dr. S.H.A. Begemann of the Technical University of Eindhoven.Lightpack 2 takes advantage of another feature of human vision: only a very small part of the retina (which is called the macula” can actually distinguish all the smallest details of a picture, with the rest of the picture being fuzzy for the rest of the retina).In fact, the very smallest part of the macula (called the fovea) and the farthest part of it from the pupil can recognize the depth of field of a picture. This means that while watching TV you can only see in focus a very small part of the picture on the screen (its size depends on the distance between your eye and the screen).Your brain then works efficiently to combine this small, focused part and the rest of the scene into a coherent picture. Using the soft illumination of Lightpack II, which extends the actual picture on the screen, you see your 40-inch TV as if it were a 50-inch home theater. Lightpack 2 uses an FPGA controlled by a generic microcontroller. Our technology breaks down image resolutions from 320x240 to 4K into a number of smaller areas, then calculates the median color values for all of them. The resolution of a given picture is detected the moment it’s changed by the HDMI source, and all the captured areas are scaled to fit the new resolution. The area width equals the picture width divided by the horizontal module number – while the height equals picture height divided by the vertical module number). All together we've requested for a 3 patents for this project.For all the hackers and tinkerers out there we will be open an API that will enable access to the full scope of Lightpack 2 functionality. Using the Lightbridge box, you’ll be able to take further control over various BLE devices and sensors. We look forward to see all the great, weird and unpredictable hacks from you!Our API will be constantly growing and improving, so be sure to check back for updates. We can't wait to see what awesome hacks you come up with.Lightbridge is WiFi-Bluetooth Smart router, which connects the Pixels with your home router via WiFi. Lightbridge is a part of Lightpack 2 which connects Lightpack 2 to your home network and Internet. With Lightbridge, you can control the entire lighting system remotely, connect it to external services like IFTTT, and extend its functionality with third party software.We are a team of people who believe in what we do. In order to carry out our project and deliver one of the best devices meant to boost experiences, we need our support from people like you.Lately, accountability and transparency have become the central problems of crowdfunding platforms. Nothing keeps project backers up at night quite like the idea of founders taking their perks dollars to Italian car manufacturers instead of Chinese factories and Belorussian programmers. But what if the information from the bank account in question was open for third party scrutiny to any backer, 24/7? Exactly that thinking led us to cooperating with Frank, a public-facing open ledger available now to any crowdfunding project. We have a dedicated project bank account which is linked to Frank, and now we’re completely open with our backers. Let our data speak for us!And here's the link where you can follow our Frank data:When we made and delivered the first Lightpack, we got tons of experience points and leveled up. We put a few points to ""FPGA Programming"" and ""HDMI Engineering"" and then picked the ""Out-Of-The-Box"" perk.We immediately started developing of a new device that wouldn’t need a permanent connection to a PC to function.All in all, the development process went pretty well, but there were some challenges to overcome. First, we had to develop a completely new hardware to run all the image processing on - the first Lightpack used a PC for that, and while the basic concept was a pass-through device between a signal source and a display screen, we needed all the magic to be made on the device side.Since standard MCUs were not fast and reliable enough to process 1080p@60 fps video, we had to choose an FPGA and discover for ourselves the very new sphere of the FPGA programming. Then, after the first prototype was built and tested, we had to make it work with an addressable LED ribbon. Remember that the first Lightpack used to have 10 LED modules which were directly plugged in, and that was not exactly the perfect decision for users with big TV screens. So we decided to let the user to choose how many LEDs he wants and made our new module extendable - you just cut the provided LED strip to the desired length.Then came an idea to make all of the room environment interactive and light it up synchronously with the picture on your screen - that’s how the Pixels were born.These little glowing boxes are made autonomous and controllable over Bluetooth Low Energy - so you can place them anywhere in your room and they will turn it to an interactive light environment.So after we had a few prototypes of Pixels working and shining (it was quite a challenge making it glow with a flat smooth light with no shadows on the edges, like a screen pixels will do), we all agreed that the light was awesome, so we made Pixels the part of Lightpack 2 set.We found that accelerometer-enabled Pixels are very fun to play with and could be connected to many stuff we had at hand like radio-controlled robot platforms. Then someone said: ""Hey, let's connect it to a PC and use it as a game controller!"" So we made a 15-minute game prototype in GameMaker Studio and used Pixel to control the in-game car. Because why the hell not?So now we have working prototypes of the central device and Pixels, the FPGA firmware to process the image and MCU firmware for high-level control of the whole set, it’s time to raise money for making the first batch of Lightpack 2 and provide this awesome experience in your living room!Woodenshark is a small team of experienced hardware and software engineers, working on designing consumer electronics from 6 different locations around the world.We believe that distance is not an obstacle for team work.

As mentioned earlier, the batch-production optimized version of the device, as well as the self-assembled devices, have been successfully tested by us. We don't expect any critical issues related to electronics. However, we will still test the pre-mass production sample device, which will be almost the same as the pilot batch device. If there are any mechanical issues (we've put a lot of work and testing into this, so we don't expect any), we will still have a chance to detect and fix those. Software related risksAs for software and firmware issues, if any, they will be covered & fixed in new releases of software\firmware. We will maintain a bug-tracker open for our users where they will be able to submit any issues. These issues will be treated with the highest priority. Production and Shipping risksProduction and shipping in time is another challenge. We are collaborating with an reputable company located in China, which takes care of the production plan and building the whole supply chain. We also design Lightpack 2 hardware and build BOM (bill of materials) according to the capabilities of well-known suppliers.Nevertheless, if we are going out of date we will let you know with project updates containing all issues, their reasons, and how we will fight them. Once the production is over, we will send the devices by batch to the warehouses in the US and Europe for further delivery to our customers. The rest of the batch will be stored in our international warehouse in China for shipments to our non-US/EU customers. International shipping, custom duties and taxesWe're are shipping Lightpack worldwide.

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">We believe that everyone — not just homeowners or the wealthy — should have the ability to secure the people, pets, and things they care about the most. We approached the product and user experience design of Canary with the following principles in mind:</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4;""><strong><img alt=""Simplicity above all else"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/canary.is/indiegogo/simplicity.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Security shouldn’t be intimidating or hard. This is why we designed Canary to be quick to set up and use right out of the box. We also designed the ongoing experience to be intuitive and easy to manage. If you can use a smartphone, you can use Canary.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4;""><strong><img alt=""Intelligence in a smart way"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/canary.is/indiegogo/intelligence.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Traditional home security systems have a 99% false alarm rate and this statistic isn't improving (see 'Disrupting a broken system' below for more info). Besides being annoying, the downside of false alarms is that it causes most households to stop using their systems over time. <span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">We believe that there is a better way. By designing a smart system that learns your home’s activity and rhythm, over time you will have fewer false alarms. And fewer false alarms means more consistent use, which, ultimately, means more reliable security.</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Security means different things to different people. So we didn’t design a rigid one-solution-fits-everyone product. Instead, we fitted our device with the core features you want and put the power in your hands to decide when and how you use Canary. Control and respond from your smartphone. That is what home security should be.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">False burglar alarm activations nation-wide are estimated at 99%. To illustrate this point, in 2002 Seattle police responded to 24,505 alarms, of which only 325 were valid caused by a valid incident.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">People are so unhappy with their current systems, that 41% of residences with alarm systems are turned off during burglaries, and 2/3 of people with security systems don't regularly turn them on.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Rental-occupied homes are much more likely to get burglarized, according to the US Department of Justice. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">60% of burglaries occur in the daytime when the residents are away.</p>

<p id=""1a"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>1a: How many Canary devices do I need in my home?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Depends on your type of home. Here is a basic guide: 1/2/3 Bedroom(s) Apt/House with 1 main entrance: 1 device 3/4 Bedroom(s) Apt/House with 2 main entrances: 2–3 devices Mansion/Estate: 3–4 devices</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Note: You can have up to 4 Canary devices in one location that connect through the free app on your phone.</p>
<p id=""1b"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>1b: Can I buy one for my office or my second home? Or use it to look after my child, elderly parent or even dog?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Sure! You can place them anywhere. And you can access both your primary locations, like your home or office, and your secondary/backup locations, from the same app. And multiple people can access a Canary from their apps, if you grant them access.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary gives you the option to check in on your home and loved ones and stay connected throughout the day. The smart intelligence recognizes disturbances, letting you know if something out of the ordinary is taking place. So peek in at your dog or your child at home with the nanny, or look after your parents in a simple way. Canary is there to connect you.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary can also be placed in your nursery where you can receive any alerts if anything seems out of the ordinary. Canary also has the ability to stream live video so you can check in on your child.</p>
<p id=""1c"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>1c: Does this replace my existing security system?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Totally up to you. It's a stand-alone system so works by itself, but if you want to keep what you have, then Canary is an awesome addition. With Canary, you have security at the touch of your phone, without complicated systems and third party notifiers/middlemen, who waste a lot of time and money and lead to many false alarms. Now YOU will be the one in control of your home security, in a more efficient and affordable way than ever before.</p>
<p id=""1d"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>1d: Can I choose what color I want for my Canary?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Yes, if you choose one of the ‘Other Canary Styles’ options you have the choice of matte black or silver. Otherwise, all Canary devices come in classic white.</p>
<p id=""1e"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>1e: Can anyone set up Canary?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Absolutely! Canary was designed with the purpose of making installation a thing of the past. Canary is one single device, designed for everyone to be able to use. Simply, take it out of the box and plug it in. It’s that easy.</p>
<p id=""2"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><img alt=""Buying &amp; Shipping"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/canary.is/indiegogo/buying-and-shipping.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p id=""2a"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>2a: What are the shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">All shipping in the US is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there is no guarantee that this will work in your country (e.g. unknown power &amp; connectivity issues) – there are many hurdles we need to go over until we have a complete picture on the international market. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.</p>
<p id=""2b"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>2b: When is the soonest I can get a Canary connected in my home?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Estimated shipping dates for the device begin in May 2014. Our goal is to have the shipment out to you earlier but we have seen some of the challenges of others, and we wanted to make sure not to overpromise. Matte black and silver devices may ship a bit later than classic white. This we promise: we are working around the clock to bring this to market, and as soon as it’s ready, it will be sent out to you!</p>
<p id=""3"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><img alt=""Technical"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/canary.is/indiegogo/technical.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p id=""3a"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3a: Can I use multiple phones with my Canary?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Yes. The app is free and a single Canary can be connected to multiple phones. For instance, if there are two people in a home, they both can be primary users on their device/s, and one could also connect to his office while the other connects to her office (if they have Canary devices there too!)</p>
<p id=""3b"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3b: How does the geofence work and can it support multiple smart phones in one home?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">When setting up Canary on your smart phone, our application will create a geofence around your home. When you enter the geofence, Canary will detect this and ‘disarm’ itself, which means it won’t notify you of movement or activity when you are home. When you leave the geofence, Canary will detect this as well and arm itself again. Canary also supports multiple users to interact with the device through our mobile app. The geofence can be overridden by manual settings (you can manually arm and disarm Canary via your phone or the web).</p>
<p id=""3c"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3c: I have a [dog, cat, etc], will this be a problem with Canary (eg false alerts)?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary was designed with pets in mind. We are building the software to identify and recognize patterns in your home (such as pets). Your interactions with Canary (through the app) will help teach the system what movements/activities are normal in your home (e.g. your dog walking across the room) so that is gets smarter and more customized to your space over time.</p>
<p id=""3d"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3d: How is Canary powered? What happens if the power or WiFi goes out?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary is plugged in, which is needed for the high volume and quality of video and sensors that we are processing. We have not included a battery within; however our system would detect a lost connection to either power or WiFi. In that case you will receive a mobile alert telling you that Canary lost its connection. You can go into the app and look at footage/data from before that power occurred, as well as be prompted with possible courses of action so that you can respond appropriately.</p>
<p id=""3e"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3e: What voltage does Canary Support?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary comes with an AC power adapter to plug your device into the wall. Canary will ship with an international switching power supply capable of 100v - 240v 50/60Hz cable.</p>
<p id=""3f"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3f: Does Canary Move (Pan / Tilt)?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary does not pan or tilt. However, it does feature a wide angle lens that should cover a large area. Canary should be placed in a location that allows it to cover the most area with its wide angle lens. Panning and tilting the camera would add the risk that Canary could miss an important event if pointed in the wrong direction.</p>
<p id=""3g"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>3g: Will there be an SDK or API?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Canary doesn’t yet have plans for an SDK. We do, however, have the implementation of an API on our roadmap and hope to make it available when we ship our product.</p>
<p id=""4"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><img alt=""Privacy and Security"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/canary.is/indiegogo/privacy-and-security.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p id=""4a"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>4a: Can I turn it off (privacy mode)?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Yes! Privacy and Security go hand in hand. With your Canary, you have full control of both. While there is an ‘automated’ mode that arms and disarms the sensors automatically, you can manually turn specific sensors (like the camera) on and off. Canary is always private and accessible only by you.</p>
<p id=""4b"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>4b: How secure is it?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">We use bank-level security. All communication between your Canary, the Canary Cloud and your smart phone is encrypted over SSL (HTTPS). Video and audio are stored and encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. You, as the user, decide if you want to store the data over time.</p>
<p id=""5"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong><img alt=""Will it work with"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/canary.is/indiegogo/will-it-work-with.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p id=""5a"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>5a: Will Canary work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">We are designing Canary so that it will work with any web enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience in our native app. Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS and Android. Canary will also be accessible through a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app which can be accessed on any web-enabled device.</p>
<p id=""5b"" style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><strong>5b: Does it work with… (my thermostat, connected lock, camera, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Good question. The answer for now is…maybe and we hope so. While we admire and respect other products and companies like Smart Things and August, for now our focus is making Canary the best and simplest security product experience in the marketplace, unencumbered by the complication of other devices and solutions.

Canary is a single device that contains an HD video camera and multiple sensors that track everything from motion, temperature and air quality to vibration, sound, and activity to help keep you, your family and your home safe. 

Controlled entirely from your iPhone or Android device, Canary alerts you when it senses anything out of the ordinary — from sudden temperature changes that can indicate a fire, to the sound and movement that could mean an intrusion. Instantly receive, view and act on the alerts wherever you are. Over time, Canary learns your home’s rhythms to send you smarter alerts. Canary is the smartest way to stay secure.






""A new startup called Canary is about to launch what could revolutionize the home security business"" – Technabob
""Canary is easy on the eyes and the smartphone interface looks equally appealing."" – The Next Web
""Canary helps the internet of things take on home security"" – GigaOM
""Similar to the Nest learning thermostat, Canary will feature algorithms that learn about and adapt to activities inside your home."" – TechHive
""Canary's a renter-friendly, dead-simple system that can keep you safe — or at least just provide some peace of mind."" – The Verge
""Home security is entering a version 2.0 status with more relevant and accurate monitoring which may prove vital soon for home owners, renters, those living alone, and the elderly alike."" – Apartment Therapy





You define your experience with Canary. From controlling when Canary is armed to which sensors are in use, Canary is designed to give you a wide feature set that you turn on and off to fit your needs.

Being away from home doesn’t mean you can’t respond to emergencies. Canary alerts you immediately when it senses something is off.

Once you receive an alert, you decide how to respond. Do you want to text your neighbor to check in? Call the police? You have the ability to decide.

Canary’s secure mobile app enables you to check in on your home from virtually anywhere — whether you are down the street or around the world.

Within the Canary app you can easily monitor and track data from many sources within your home, including temperature, air quality, humidity, activity (video, audio & movement) and other trends in your home environment.




We believe that everyone — not just homeowners or the wealthy — should have the ability to secure the people, pets, and things they care about the most. We approached the product and user experience design of Canary with the following principles in mind:

Security shouldn’t be intimidating or hard. This is why we designed Canary to be quick to set up and use right out of the box. We also designed the ongoing experience to be intuitive and easy to manage. If you can use a smartphone, you can use Canary.

Traditional home security systems have a 99% false alarm rate and this statistic isn't improving (see 'Disrupting a broken system' below for more info). Besides being annoying, the downside of false alarms is that it causes most households to stop using their systems over time. We believe that there is a better way. By designing a smart system that learns your home’s activity and rhythm, over time you will have fewer false alarms. And fewer false alarms means more consistent use, which, ultimately, means more reliable security.

Security means different things to different people. So we didn’t design a rigid one-solution-fits-everyone product. Instead, we fitted our device with the core features you want and put the power in your hands to decide when and how you use Canary. Control and respond from your smartphone. That is what home security should be.











With Canary, the app and primary service are free, and accessable via as many phones as you’d like. That means you can download the free app, receive alerts, add your friends or family as your backup, and see live streaming of video, audio and other sensor data.
After the products ship, there will be additional (optional) service plans that include more data options (such as storing events over a longer period of time) and a call-center backup. These premium plans will have a surcharge but are optional and contract-free. Contributing to the campaign here in no way signs you up for a paid service plan. Updates to the app are free for users as well.




We set out to disrupt the home security industry by designing a solution that addresses the major consumer pain points of existing products.

The old way of security is measured in numbers of sensors spread across your home. That approach leads to high costs, tons of complication, and lots of false alarms. All of which is out of your control.

In 2000, the cost of responding to false burglar alarms was estimated at $1.8 billion. This is a problem that affects more than just the home owners.These are our tax dollars at work.
False burglar alarm activations nation-wide are estimated at 99%. To illustrate this point, in 2002 Seattle police responded to 24,505 alarms, of which only 325 were valid caused by a valid incident.
People are so unhappy with their current systems, that 41% of residences with alarm systems are turned off during burglaries, and 2/3 of people with security systems don't regularly turn them on.
Rental-occupied homes are much more likely to get burglarized, according to the US Department of Justice. 
60% of burglaries occur in the daytime when the residents are away.








Here's a breakdown of the perks you can choose from when you support this campaign (select your perk from the sidebar at the top of this page). All perks include at least one brand new Canary and the free Canary mobile app (for any number of users & phones).

OTHER QUESTIONS


1a: How many Canary devices do I need in my home?
Depends on your type of home. Here is a basic guide: 1/2/3 Bedroom(s) Apt/House with 1 main entrance: 1 device 3/4 Bedroom(s) Apt/House with 2 main entrances: 2–3 devices Mansion/Estate: 3–4 devices
Note: You can have up to 4 Canary devices in one location that connect through the free app on your phone.
1b: Can I buy one for my office or my second home? Or use it to look after my child, elderly parent or even dog?
Sure! You can place them anywhere. And you can access both your primary locations, like your home or office, and your secondary/backup locations, from the same app. And multiple people can access a Canary from their apps, if you grant them access.
Canary gives you the option to check in on your home and loved ones and stay connected throughout the day. The smart intelligence recognizes disturbances, letting you know if something out of the ordinary is taking place. So peek in at your dog or your child at home with the nanny, or look after your parents in a simple way. Canary is there to connect you.
Canary can also be placed in your nursery where you can receive any alerts if anything seems out of the ordinary. Canary also has the ability to stream live video so you can check in on your child.
1c: Does this replace my existing security system?
Totally up to you. It's a stand-alone system so works by itself, but if you want to keep what you have, then Canary is an awesome addition. With Canary, you have security at the touch of your phone, without complicated systems and third party notifiers/middlemen, who waste a lot of time and money and lead to many false alarms. Now YOU will be the one in control of your home security, in a more efficient and affordable way than ever before.
1d: Can I choose what color I want for my Canary?
Yes, if you choose one of the ‘Other Canary Styles’ options you have the choice of matte black or silver. Otherwise, all Canary devices come in classic white.
1e: Can anyone set up Canary?
Absolutely! Canary was designed with the purpose of making installation a thing of the past. Canary is one single device, designed for everyone to be able to use. Simply, take it out of the box and plug it in. It’s that easy.

2a: What are the shipping costs?
All shipping in the US is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there is no guarantee that this will work in your country (e.g. unknown power & connectivity issues) – there are many hurdles we need to go over until we have a complete picture on the international market. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.
2b: When is the soonest I can get a Canary connected in my home?
Estimated shipping dates for the device begin in May 2014. Our goal is to have the shipment out to you earlier but we have seen some of the challenges of others, and we wanted to make sure not to overpromise. Matte black and silver devices may ship a bit later than classic white. This we promise: we are working around the clock to bring this to market, and as soon as it’s ready, it will be sent out to you!

3a: Can I use multiple phones with my Canary?
Yes. The app is free and a single Canary can be connected to multiple phones. For instance, if there are two people in a home, they both can be primary users on their device/s, and one could also connect to his office while the other connects to her office (if they have Canary devices there too!)
3b: How does the geofence work and can it support multiple smart phones in one home?
When setting up Canary on your smart phone, our application will create a geofence around your home. When you enter the geofence, Canary will detect this and ‘disarm’ itself, which means it won’t notify you of movement or activity when you are home. When you leave the geofence, Canary will detect this as well and arm itself again. Canary also supports multiple users to interact with the device through our mobile app. The geofence can be overridden by manual settings (you can manually arm and disarm Canary via your phone or the web).
3c: I have a [dog, cat, etc], will this be a problem with Canary (eg false alerts)?
Canary was designed with pets in mind. We are building the software to identify and recognize patterns in your home (such as pets). Your interactions with Canary (through the app) will help teach the system what movements/activities are normal in your home (e.g. your dog walking across the room) so that is gets smarter and more customized to your space over time.
3d: How is Canary powered? What happens if the power or WiFi goes out?
Canary is plugged in, which is needed for the high volume and quality of video and sensors that we are processing. We have not included a battery within; however our system would detect a lost connection to either power or WiFi. In that case you will receive a mobile alert telling you that Canary lost its connection. You can go into the app and look at footage/data from before that power occurred, as well as be prompted with possible courses of action so that you can respond appropriately.
3e: What voltage does Canary Support?
Canary comes with an AC power adapter to plug your device into the wall. Canary will ship with an international switching power supply capable of 100v - 240v 50/60Hz cable.
3f: Does Canary Move (Pan / Tilt)?
Canary does not pan or tilt. However, it does feature a wide angle lens that should cover a large area. Canary should be placed in a location that allows it to cover the most area with its wide angle lens. Panning and tilting the camera would add the risk that Canary could miss an important event if pointed in the wrong direction.
3g: Will there be an SDK or API?
Canary doesn’t yet have plans for an SDK. We do, however, have the implementation of an API on our roadmap and hope to make it available when we ship our product.

4a: Can I turn it off (privacy mode)?
Yes! Privacy and Security go hand in hand. With your Canary, you have full control of both. While there is an ‘automated’ mode that arms and disarms the sensors automatically, you can manually turn specific sensors (like the camera) on and off. Canary is always private and accessible only by you.
4b: How secure is it?
We use bank-level security. All communication between your Canary, the Canary Cloud and your smart phone is encrypted over SSL (HTTPS). Video and audio are stored and encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. You, as the user, decide if you want to store the data over time.

5a: Will Canary work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported?
We are designing Canary so that it will work with any web enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience in our native app. Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS and Android. Canary will also be accessible through a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app which can be accessed on any web-enabled device.
5b: Does it work with… (my thermostat, connected lock, camera, etc.)?
Good question. The answer for now is…maybe and we hope so. While we admire and respect other products and companies like Smart Things and August, for now our focus is making Canary the best and simplest security product experience in the marketplace, unencumbered by the complication of other devices and solutions. Stay tuned for developments in this space.

6a: Can I mount Canary on a wall or ceiling?
Canary was designed to be placed on flat surfaces. Suggested locations include but are not limited to; countertops, tables, bookshelves (free-standing or wall-mounted shelves), end-tables, credenzas, etc
6b: What if someone steals or smashes my Canary?
Canary packs an accelerometer in the event that if your Canary is moved you can be immediately notified. If the device breaks and cannot connect with our servers, our system will send an alert to your mobile phone to notify you of the break in connection. You will be able to then see footage leading up to that incident.
6c: Do I need to use the Canary Cloud? Can I run my own storage server/FTP server/backend?
Canary Cloud is needed in order to take advantage of our learning system and advanced algorithms, the devices’ data needs to be analyzed on our cloud system. Canary does not have any user accessible local storage. Canary does have a small amount of local memory that will be used as a buffer while the device uploads data to Canary Cloud. A separate FTP/Backend is not supported by the device, as the data needs to be anaylized in our Canary Cloud system for the learning capabilities to work.

7a: What are the challenges?
We are doing something that has never been done before: a completely revolutionary security device like nothing else in the market. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process. Soon, Canary devices will be securing homes and connecting people to their homes and their families like never before.

Copper has over twice the density of aluminumQuality:Each cube and the stand is made from high purity billet, machined on a CNC mill with extreme precision. After machining, the cubes are then polished prior to being laser engraved. How large are the cubes?Each Cube is approximately 1"" x 1"" x 1"". Calipers Measuring the Cubes How pure are the cubes?All the cubes are greater than or approximately equal to 90% purity. 
""Fe"" is low-carbon steel (~96% pure Iron). 
""Al"" is 6061 aerospace grade aluminum (96-98% pure aluminum). 
""Ti"" is aerospace grade Ti-6-4 titanium (~90% titanium).
 ""Cu"" is C110 (~99% copper).
""W"" is C2 Tungsten (~95% Tungsten)
  Don't iron and copper oxidize/patina/rust?All metals oxidize under certain conditions, but you can easily prevent this from taking place. That said, the copper and iron will form a beautiful patina over time if you allow it to take place. The iron cube is technically low-carbon steel (~96% Iron) so if you would like to keep a patina from happening, be sure to regularly apply a very thin layer of oil to the ""Fe"" cube. Because the copper cube is so reactive, we put the copper cubes through a passivation process that inhibits the oxidation of the metal. Will you deliver on time and as promised?We take our reputation very seriously and we always aim to deliver a high quality product in a timely manner.

<p>Weighitz are smart, portable, modular and high precision. They can be used individually or combined to weigh just about anything.</p>
<p>Use Weighitz as a single scale or as a set. Alone, they are ideal for home kitchen use. When combined, a set of Weighitz can weigh heavier or more oddly shaped objects.</p>
<p>A set of Weighitz can replace all your home weighing scales. Weighitz have no platform, so you’re no longer constrained by size or shape. Calibrate any container to weigh whatever you like. Need to weigh your Labrador? Turn their dog bed into a smart scale. </p>

</div>","Weighitz are smart, portable, modular and high precision. They can be used individually or combined to weigh just about anything.
Use Weighitz as a single scale or as a set. Alone, they are ideal for home kitchen use. When combined, a set of Weighitz can weigh heavier or more oddly shaped objects.
A set of Weighitz can replace all your home weighing scales. Weighitz have no platform, so you’re no longer constrained by size or shape. Calibrate any container to weigh whatever you like. Need to weigh your Labrador? Turn their dog bed into a smart scale. 





Weighitz are designed to be easy to use. Just squeeze on, place them under whatever you need to weigh, open the app and begin weighing.
Weighitz output to the Weighitz smartphone app. The app makes weighing smart and simple.





 





When using more than one Weighitz, the app will combine the readings from all the scales into a single reading.





We have been amazed at the number of suggestions for Weighitz applications. We encourage backers to tell us how Weighitz might solve one of their weighing problems. Here are the top apps we have created so far: All of the below are part of the main Weighitz app.



App Examples


 





Sensitive enough to weigh herbs and spices. They also have a wide range, so you can weigh heavy things like flour and rice. Planning a party for twenty guests? Combine Weighitz to weigh just about anything. Weighitz can do a lot of other cool things, like convert metric to imperial units. Even convert non-standard units like cups to grams.



Kitchen Scale


 





The Weigh-Anything app allows the user free range over Weighitz. Users can see the combined reading. The readings from each Weighitz or even the raw uncalibrated units. The Weigh anything app is ideal for those with unique weighing needs, below are a few of our favorite uses.

Pet, baby & infant Scale - Turn the bed into a scale




Weigh pets and babies with ease



Sample Scale (compare sample weights in real time)




Compare Samples


 Weigh Packages (0-270lb)



Weigh Packages


 





The app connects to a large database that contains the nutritional content of a wide range of foods. This data displays when weighing and records the nutrients in each meal.



Portion Control



 Portion control is vital for those on strict diets, like athletes and diabetics. 
The portion control app will integrate with a larger health application - including - calorie and diet recommendations.
This will also be integrated into the automatic baking and smoothie making apps - with healthy recipe alternative and suggestions (update 1).






Combine Weighitz, to create a portable smart body scale.



Weigh yourself or family members


The body weight app will allow tracking of your weight, BMI and will eventually be part of the healthy living app - this app will combine with the kitchen and automatic baking app to suggest healthy ways to achieve weight loss, gains or more specific goals - like muscle building. 





Our luggage app turns your whole suitcase into a smart weighing scale.



Weigh Luggage


See the weight adjust in real-time as you pack your luggage. Receive a warning when approaching baggage limits.





We are building apps based on the needs of our backers. In addition to the above-mentioned apps, we are producing two cool new apps our backers will love:  
Automatic Baking:
Baking based on weight is a simple yet precise method of baking. We are creating an app that will contain a variety of recipes based on the automatic baking concept. 
Smoothie Maker/Cocktail Maker:  
Like automatic baking. Follow simple weight-based recipes for delicious and healthy cocktails and smoothies.
What's your favourite?
We love to hear from our backers. We are going to take a poll after the campaign to determine our backers favorite apps. Then make them a reality.





When an object is placed on the surface, the top layer deforms. Weighing sensors under the cover detect slight deformations in the material.The force experienced by each Weighitz is measured and sent to the smartphone.
Depending on the app module you choose, the individual weights, combined weight or just raw readings can be viewed.



Single Scale        ____________________        Set of Weighitz


We designed Weighitz to be attractive in any kitchen whilst being sturdy enough to be thrown in a gym bag.





We have optimized the dimensions to be sleek enough to fit into your pocket. A wide enough surface to hold the average kitchen plate/bowl & high enough to hold up a fabric suitcase
0.90""/2.3cm high - Required to keep larger pots/bowls and fabric suitcases from touching the ground when weighing.  
3.19""/8.1 cm Wide - Designed to be wide enough for a single unit to hold an average sized plate, bowl, large glass.





Designed for use in the kitchen and on the go. Weighitz are water resistant to IP4 level. This means you can wash them with a wet sponge but not submerge them in water.





The miniature design and magnetic base make for easy storage. Place them on the fridge for easy access.





Low power consumption and high capacity batteries combine so you rarely have to recharge. When required, plug in the micro USB cable and attach to your computer or wall socket. An indicator will light up when charged.





Micro-indents in the top and bottom surfaces make Weighitz non-slip. This makes it easy to place larger dishes on Weighitz with confidence.





BLE allows communication between the Weighitz and your smart device. BLE uses little energy which gives Weighitz a long battery life. BLE has a large range (approx 100m) which allows for remote weighing.





 





 
 
Each Weighitz scale can weigh a wide range of weights with high accuracy and resolution. Each Weighitz can weigh up to 90lb with a resolution of 0.0002lb.

I have been working as a 3D artist for nearly 20 years, and design is part of my life. I am happy to spend my free time doing this, too. I have designed a lot of furniture and many useful objects for my friends and for myself, and I feel very satisfied when I am successful in carrying out an idea.</p><p>I've been trying for years to grow strawberries on our terrace, and from these experiments was born a container with which it is possible to make a vertical garden of any size or shape. I've got a lot of positive feedback and interest from the people around me, and so I thought I should try to make this available to other people, too.</p><p> </p><p>Szerencsés vagyok mert abból élek, amit szeretek, 3D grafikusként dolgozom már lassan 20 éve, a tervezés része az életemnek. A szabadidőmet is szívesen töltöm ezzel, sok bútort, használati tárgyat terveztem már a barátaimnak és magamnak is, örömmel tölt el, ha sikerül megvalósítani egy ötletemet.</p><p>Évek óta próbálkozom földieper termesztéssel a teraszunkon, az ebből szerzett tapasztalatokból született ez az edény, amiből bármilyen méretű és alakú függőleges kert építhető. Sok pozitív visszajelzést és érdeklődést kaptam a környezetemből, ezért gondoltam arra, hogy megpróbálom elérhetővé tenni ezt mások számára is.</p><p> </p><h2>Why I need your help / Miért kérem a segítséged</h2><p> </p><p>To manufacture this container in an inexpensive way, a unique injection moulding tool is necessary, which itself is rather expensive. With support, we could finance this tool and, of course, everybody's own containers! </p><p>We came to an agreement with a manufacturing company who can both make the tool and do the moulding. Adding the cost of transport and packaging, it turns out that for a successful campaign we need 23,000 USD, which would be budgeted in the following way:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528402186/npxgtfjf2gk0w4b6gr4z.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The tool could be produced in 3 month (including testing), after which the actual manufacturing could start, plus cutting the bars to the proper sizes, packaging, and, finally, transport. </p><p>This campaign has a fixed goal; unfortunately, if we don't succeed, then we can't start manufacturing. Of course, in that case everyone would get their money back.</p><p> </p><p>Az edény gazdaságos legyártásához egy egyedi fröccsöntő szerszámra van szükség, ami nagyon drága.

That would be very complicated due to international regulations on commerce in plants. At least everyone can choose the sort of plant they would like to grow from among the broad selection of available types.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nem, nem jár. A nemzetközi növénykereskedelmi szabályok miatt ez nagyon bonyolult lenne, és így legalább mindenki eldöntheti, hogy a rengeteg fajta közül melyiket szeretné termelni.</p><p>How often should I water the plants? / Milyen gyakran kell öntözni a növényeket?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It mainly depends on the weather, on how warm it is, and on how much the sun shines on your garden. But during the hottest days it may be necessary to water daily. By the way, it would be easy to expand the system by adding automatic watering devices. And if this campaign is successful, that will be the next step!</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ez nagyban függ az időjárástól, hogy mennyire van meleg, és mennyire van napos helyen a kertünk, de a legnagyobb hőségben akár naponta szükséges lehet a locsolás. Egyébként nagyon könnyen bővíthető a rendszer automatikus öntözővel, ha sikeres lesz ez a kampány, az lesz a következő!</p><p>Is it possible to build a wall from a tower? / Falból is lehet tornyot építeni?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Of course, but it won't be that large, as it comes with only three brace bars.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Természetesen igen, de mivel abban a csomagban csak 3 tartórúd van, nem lesz olyan széles.</p><p>What are the brace bars made of? / Miből készülnek a tartórudak?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The standard bar is a stainless steel tube 8 mm in diameter, but any other kind of tube may be used as long as it’s not too wide. So if you would like to create a form for which there are not enough bars, you could easily find some more at a nearby store.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A tartórudak 8 mm átmérőjű rozsdamentes acél csövek, de bármilyen más cső is is jó, ami ennél nem szélesebb. Így ha olyan formát találnál ki, amihez nincs elég rudad, könnyen pótolhatod egy helyi boltból.</p><p>Into what should we insert the bars? / Mibe kell szúrni a tartórudat?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Into anything—as long as it can hold the bars stable. It could be a pot filled with soil or gravel. It just has to be heavy enough so that the garden doesn’t fall over.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Bármibe lehet, ami stabilan tudja tartani. Egy földel töltött cserép is elég, arra kell csak figyelni, hogy elég nehéz legyen ahhoz, hogy a kert ne tudjon felborulni.<br/> </p></div>","How it works / Hogyan működik    Design / DizájnEach little garden is made out of containers that are 7 cm high and 12 cm long with a triangular base.

Ezeket a rudakat leszúrhatjuk egy virágcserépbe, virágládába vagy bármilyen földbe, ez tartja majd stabilan a szerkezetet.Water-saving / VíztakarékosYou can build any kind of structure, and the containers will be offset from one another so that the plants always get enough room and light to grow; furthermore, it is enough to water the top-level containers, and the water will run down to all the other levels.The drainage holes at the bottom of the containers are raised; therefore, the water that remains will continue to provide the plants with optimal conditions. Bármilyen rendszert is építesz, a szinteken az edények egymáshoz képest eltolva lesznek, így a növényeknek mindig lesz elég hely, és fény, hogy nőjenek, és elég csak a legfelső szintet locsolnod, onnan az összes többire lefolyik a víz.Az edény alján a vízelvezető lyukak magasítottak, így az ott maradó víz még tovább tudja biztosítani a növénynek az optimális körülményeket. Versatile / SokoldalúAlthough the initial idea was for strawberries, you can also plant flowers. You can build it in any form you want: a classical tower, a wall, a partition.... You can put your garden by a wall, in a corner, on a table. It will look great anywhere! (Just don't forget to water it!)Habár az eredeti ötletadó a földieper volt, ültethetünk az edényekbe virágot is. Bármilyen formát építhetünk, klasszikus tornyot, falat, térelválasztót, rakhatjuk a kertünket egy fal mellé, sarokba, asztalra, mindenhol remekül fog mutatni, csak ne felejtsük el locsolni! Background / Háttér I am lucky because I make a living doing what I like. I have been working as a 3D artist for nearly 20 years, and design is part of my life. I am happy to spend my free time doing this, too. I have designed a lot of furniture and many useful objects for my friends and for myself, and I feel very satisfied when I am successful in carrying out an idea.I've been trying for years to grow strawberries on our terrace, and from these experiments was born a container with which it is possible to make a vertical garden of any size or shape. I've got a lot of positive feedback and interest from the people around me, and so I thought I should try to make this available to other people, too. Szerencsés vagyok mert abból élek, amit szeretek, 3D grafikusként dolgozom már lassan 20 éve, a tervezés része az életemnek. A szabadidőmet is szívesen töltöm ezzel, sok bútort, használati tárgyat terveztem már a barátaimnak és magamnak is, örömmel tölt el, ha sikerül megvalósítani egy ötletemet.Évek óta próbálkozom földieper termesztéssel a teraszunkon, az ebből szerzett tapasztalatokból született ez az edény, amiből bármilyen méretű és alakú függőleges kert építhető. Sok pozitív visszajelzést és érdeklődést kaptam a környezetemből, ezért gondoltam arra, hogy megpróbálom elérhetővé tenni ezt mások számára is. Why I need your help / Miért kérem a segítséged To manufacture this container in an inexpensive way, a unique injection moulding tool is necessary, which itself is rather expensive. With support, we could finance this tool and, of course, everybody's own containers! We came to an agreement with a manufacturing company who can both make the tool and do the moulding. Adding the cost of transport and packaging, it turns out that for a successful campaign we need 23,000 USD, which would be budgeted in the following way:The tool could be produced in 3 month (including testing), after which the actual manufacturing could start, plus cutting the bars to the proper sizes, packaging, and, finally, transport. This campaign has a fixed goal; unfortunately, if we don't succeed, then we can't start manufacturing. Of course, in that case everyone would get their money back. Az edény gazdaságos legyártásához egy egyedi fröccsöntő szerszámra van szükség, ami nagyon drága. A támogatásokból ezt a szerszámot tudnánk finanszírozni és persze mindenkinek a saját edényeit! Sikerült megállapodni egy gyártó céggel, akik a szerszám gyártását és a fröccsöntést is el tudnák végezni, ehhez adva a szállítási és csomagolási költségeket jött ki az, hogy a sikeres kampányhoz  23000 USD-ra lenne szükségünk, amit a következőképpen használnánk fel:A szerszám legyártása 3 hónapot vesz igénybe a próbanyomással együtt, ezután indulhat a tényleges gyártás, a tartórudak méretre vágása, a csomagolás, végül a szállítás. A kampány fix célú, sajnos ha a kitűzött célunkat nem sikerül elérni, nem tudjuk elkezdeni a gyártást. Ebben az esetben az elküldött támogatást természetesen mindenki visszakapja! Perks - E-book with strawberry recipes / Elektronikus Epres RecepteskönyvFor this campaign we will produce a little strawberry recipe book for those who like to cook. For this I have chosen 16 strawberries recipes collected from here and there, right up to great-grandma's secret cake recipe—and illustrated with gorgeous photographs!A kampányhoz készül egy kis epres receptes könyv is azok számára, akik szeretnek főzőcskézni. Ebben az innen-onnan gyűjtött ételektől kezdve a dédi titkos családi sütijéig válogattam össze 16 epres receptet, csodálatos fotókkal illusztrálva!- Small tower / Kis toronySix (6) containers with connecting bars. With this kit it's possible to build a small tower: a perfect table decoration in which you can grow strawberries, flowers, or spices!6 db edény, és a hozzá szükséges tartó rudak. Ebből egy kis tornyot építhetünk, ami tökéletes dísze lehet egy asztalnak is, akár epret, virágot vagy fűszereket ültetünk bele!- Medium tower / Közepes tornyTwelve (12) containers with connecting bars, for those who want to get more familiar with gardening.12 db edény, és a hozzá szükséges tartó rudak, a kertészkedéssel barátkozók számára.- Large tower / Nagy torony Eighteen (18) containers with connecting bars: This little garden is a perfect decoration for any terrace.18 db edény, és a hozzá szükséges tartó rudak, ez a kis kert ideális dísze lehet bármilyen kis terasznak!- One-sided wall / Egy oldalú falTwenty-one (21) containers with connecting bars: This is perfect next to a wall because the plants all look in the same direction.21 db edény, és a hozzá szükséges tartó rudak. Ez az építési mód ideális falak mellé állítva, mert a növények itt mind egy irányba néznek.- Partition (double wall) / Dupla falForty-two (42) containers with connecting bars: With this you can plant on both sides of the wall; therefore, it will look wonderful from any direction, whether strawberries or flowers are planted in it!42 db edény, és a hozzá szükséges tartó rudak. Itt a fal mind a két oldalára ültetünk, így bárhonnan is nézzünk a falunkat csodásan fog mutatni, akár epret, akár virágot ültetünk bele!- Experimentation package / Kísérletező csomagOne hundred two (102) containers with 20 pieces 100-cm bars, so you can build a garden just the way you want it to be!102 db edény, és 20 db 100 cm hosszú rúd, hogy olyan kertet építhessünk, amilyet csak akarunk! Other Ways You Can Help / Hogyan tudsz segíteni You can help a lot just by sharing this campaign with your friends and acquaintances. They also may be interested!Már azzal is sokat segíthetsz, ha a barátaiddal, ismerőseiddel megosztod ezt a kampányt, hátha őket is érdekli! Frequently Asked Questions / Gyakran Ismételt Kérdések Do strawberries come with the containers? / Az edényekhez jár eper is?No, they do not. That would be very complicated due to international regulations on commerce in plants. At least everyone can choose the sort of plant they would like to grow from among the broad selection of available types.Nem, nem jár. A nemzetközi növénykereskedelmi szabályok miatt ez nagyon bonyolult lenne, és így legalább mindenki eldöntheti, hogy a rengeteg fajta közül melyiket szeretné termelni.How often should I water the plants? / Milyen gyakran kell öntözni a növényeket?It mainly depends on the weather, on how warm it is, and on how much the sun shines on your garden. But during the hottest days it may be necessary to water daily. By the way, it would be easy to expand the system by adding automatic watering devices. And if this campaign is successful, that will be the next step!Ez nagyban függ az időjárástól, hogy mennyire van meleg, és mennyire van napos helyen a kertünk, de a legnagyobb hőségben akár naponta szükséges lehet a locsolás. Egyébként nagyon könnyen bővíthető a rendszer automatikus öntözővel, ha sikeres lesz ez a kampány, az lesz a következő!Is it possible to build a wall from a tower? / Falból is lehet tornyot építeni?Of course, but it won't be that large, as it comes with only three brace bars.Természetesen igen, de mivel abban a csomagban csak 3 tartórúd van, nem lesz olyan széles.What are the brace bars made of? / Miből készülnek a tartórudak?The standard bar is a stainless steel tube 8 mm in diameter, but any other kind of tube may be used as long as it’s not too wide. So if you would like to create a form for which there are not enough bars, you could easily find some more at a nearby store.A tartórudak 8 mm átmérőjű rozsdamentes acél csövek, de bármilyen más cső is is jó, ami ennél nem szélesebb. Így ha olyan formát találnál ki, amihez nincs elég rudad, könnyen pótolhatod egy helyi boltból.Into what should we insert the bars? / Mibe kell szúrni a tartórudat?Into anything—as long as it can hold the bars stable. It could be a pot filled with soil or gravel. It just has to be heavy enough so that the garden doesn’t fall over.Bármibe lehet, ami stabilan tudja tartani. Egy földel töltött cserép is elég, arra kell csak figyelni, hogy elég nehéz legyen ahhoz, hogy a kert ne tudjon felborulni.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I
am Rycke Brown, Natural Gardener and now Litter Cleaner.  I’m also known
as the Weed Lady, the Cookie Lady, and the Lady on the Corner with a
Sign.  That’s what happens when one protests the War on Drugs, 2 hours a
week for 10 years.</p>
<p>I’ve
moved on from protesting the Drug War to demonstrating litter cleaning, a
subtle protest against non-enforcement of our litter nuisance code.  I’d
like to clean litter 40 hours per week, but I need help to make the transition
from private gardening to full-time public litter cleaning.</p>
<p>I
ended my No More Drug War protest exactly 10 years after it started, on
Mother’s Day 2013, after the politicians started to jump on the bandwagon for
marijuana.</p>
<p>I
was charged in 2009 with Criminal Trespass 2 for petitioning and passing leaflets
in our Public Market; got convicted of 4 counts in 2010, and spent 20 days on
Work Crew. </p>
<p><b>A Better Cause</b></p>
<p>While
I was protesting the Drug War, people would occasionally tell me that I should
""find a better cause.""  I found it on Work Crew.  </p>
<p>I
had already been cleaning up litter as I walked my dog, because I hated seeing
the same pieces lying in the gutter day after day, week after week.  One
doesn’t clean up litter because one likes to do so, but because one is driven
to do so.  It relieves the pain of seeing it.  It is a protest of
property neglect.</p>
<p>Litter
is tagging, marking the territory of the disorderly.  Disorderly vagrant
campers throw litter around to see if it gets cleaned up and to repel orderly
people.  If it doesn’t get cleaned up, they know that they can safely
camp.  Disorderly residents likewise claim other people’s property by
putting their trash on it, making their mark on their world.  Or they just
let it lie on their property, and let others control its use.</p>
<p>Cleaning
up litter is not serving the people who don’t “bother” to put it where it
belongs.  It is taking control and ownership of property, claiming it for
orderly and respectable folks.  Some people do it on the streets, for the
same reason I started, because they can’t stand trash.  But they draw
little notice, just as I did before I wore the tunic and made a sign.</p>
<p><b>Starting in the Snow</b></p>
<p>I
started working in the tunic after the late fall snowstorm and deep freeze last
December, when I couldn’t do any gardening.  Within a couple months, I had
added an A-frame sign for setting on the top of my truck or by the road, so
people would know I am working in the area when I am out of sight.  I’ve
bought bright yellow “ODOT” litter cleaning bags;<b>the
City gave me the first 10 bags and it sponsors disposal</b>by allowing me to leave my litter bags
next to trash cans in its parks. <b>Logan
Design </b>donated green oval “Let’s Clean Up Grants Pass” stickers for

asking for a year’s income, $25,000, to pursue public litter cleaning at least
40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year.  If I don’t get the full amount, you

<p><b>This Demonstration is Affecting Behavior</b></p>
<p>This
fundraising campaign is your only chance to ensure that this demonstration
continues and goes full-time.  It has been having an effect on behavior,
even at two days a week.</p>
<p>Before
I used the tunic and sign, I cleaned my neighborhood every day for a years,
walking my dog and picking up litter, and it never decreased.  I started
avoiding places that were too littered.  People didn’t notice my litter
cleaning, except for Carl Wilson seeing me picking up litter in the park one
day, and mentioning it on KAJO a few times. </p>
<p>After
using both the tunic and the sign a just a few times while cleaning my
neighborhood, most of my neighborhood has been staying remarkably clean. 
After cleaning at the intersection of Redwood Avenue and Redwood Highway for
several weeks this spring, yards along Redwood Avenue started being cleaned
up.  A business that was oblivious to my cleaning for months has suddenly
become much cleaner.  People have been telling me that they are picking up
litter, too. </p>
<p>Increasing
my cleaning to 5 days a week, 8 hours per day should more than double the
effects of my cleaning.  If I am funded, I will be able to clean up less

Baker and Tussing Parks.</p>

<h3>The light.</h3>
<p>Light is an integral part of our life and of the entire planet – of animals, plants and humans. Light plays a huge role in human’s life. Thanks to it, we can orientate in space using our sense of vision. Light gives us the opportunity to cognize the world around us, to control and coordinate our movements. The lack of light leads to deterioration of the body, to the apathy and loss of strength.​</p>
<p>Each of you has lighting sources, but for many years they were remaining unchanged and were having only one function, until today. We present to your attention Glowwood.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496216091/nrmpbcvjf17fz5f6fak4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We elaborately selected materials and paid attention to all the details of the design in order to meet all kind of demands. With your help, we can together make each house more comfortable and cozy.</p>

<h3>Letter of motivation</h3>
<p>Glowwood is the first project of the young energetic team “Alex Capital Venture”.</p>
<p>Our team members have diverse backgrounds in city planning, marketing and economics, social innovations and IT.  We decided to combine our expertise and start developing new products that we love. Today we are honored introduce you a Smart Lamp Glowwood.</p>

Light is an integral part of our life and of the entire planet – of animals, plants and humans. Light plays a huge role in human’s life. Thanks to it, we can orientate in space using our sense of vision. Light gives us the opportunity to cognize the world around us, to control and coordinate our movements. The lack of light leads to deterioration of the body, to the apathy and loss of strength.​
Each of you has lighting sources, but for many years they were remaining unchanged and were having only one function, until today. We present to your attention Glowwood.

We elaborately selected materials and paid attention to all the details of the design in order to meet all kind of demands. With your help, we can together make each house more comfortable and cozy.

Glowwood has the functions of additional lighting as well as decoration that can change with your interior design, mood and situation. Everything will be changed with the application.
​​Using the application in dimmer mode, you can not only select any of 16 million colors, but also control the brightness and turn on the lighting partly.


Thanks to the remote controller, which are included, Glowwood turns into your coach and will always tell you exactly how many movements and approaches you have made, and when it's time to take a break or return to training.

Notifications mode
​Each of us can miss an important call when you don’t hear the phone or it is in silent mode, but now this will not happen. Glowwood will attract your attention to an incoming or missed call, and will tell you about received notifications.

Alarm mode
​The alarm mode will allow you to wake up comfortably with the sunrise. Glowwood will smoothly change the tone and brightness of lighting from the warm halftones to sharply white light, this mode favorably affects the nervous system and allows you to feel perfectly from the awakening. 


Relax mode
​We have used a lot of researches about the influence of the light and color immunity by human and created the regime that allows you to do away with the stress and achieve harmony.





Letter of motivation
Glowwood is the first project of the young energetic team “Alex Capital Venture”.
Our team members have diverse backgrounds in city planning, marketing and economics, social innovations and IT.  We decided to combine our expertise and start developing new products that we love. Today we are honored introduce you a Smart Lamp Glowwood.
We came up with this invention when realized that each of us has a desk lamp, alarm clock, decorative lighting and other things that have not changed for many years and we decided to combine them into one innovative product that can be controlled through the application.
We love to think out of the box, reinvent existing things, and do our best to make a difference. Today, our passion is light, because nothing moves in the whole universe faster than light. We believe that light has a great impact on humans and can improve our life experience.
Please support our startup and we will not let you down! We eager to develop new things that make life joyful, and bring easiness and beauty to everyday life.
How we do it
​Our team spent half a year exploring the question of the impact of light on human, and it allowed us to develop and present to you an ecologically friendly product of the highest quality that will give you an incredible comfort and coziness, and also will become your trusted companion.

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>REDHED may look simple but there are actually many complex parts to it.  The helpful funding we receive will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plastic injection molds and setup</li>
<li>Electronic component manufacturing</li>
<li>General design and assembly</li>
<li>Getting the product finalized and in your hands</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>The Outcome</h3>
<p><b><i>Finishing Touches:</i></b><br/>We have already started (and almost finished) the revisions on the shell design for the <i>FINAL</i> REDHED.  The first design was great for a prototype/working proof of concept however the final REDHED look will feature a much smoother sleeker body with just a few high output efficient LEDs instead of entire outdated LED banks.  The magnets will be over-molded into the body for a clean appearance and minimal effort to retrieve your metal goodie bits.  It's going to be sweet.</p>
<p><b><i>Delivery:</i></b><br/>We have noticed on several crowd funded campaigns the product often has a delivery date promise that does not get met.  We really want to avoid that.  Once funded we will be working hard for a delivery date in late 2014.  Ideally delivering in time for the Christmas season.  While some may think this is a long time, we see it as a way to make sure we are getting you a solid professional product that will last you a long time without any hiccups.</p>

The Brighter way to clean. BriteSweep is a line of illuminated cleaning tools. Attached LED lighting allows users to see in poorly lit spaces so cleaning is more thorough, effective and efficient.Dirt, dust and debris can hide in plain sight; polluting our homes, encouraging growth of mold and irritating allergens. BriteSweep is here to shine some light and provide a smarter, brighter clean to help you live a brighter life.     Too often we sweep or clean an area just to come back to missed spots. Typically the lighting in our homes is designed to light the room or create ambiance but not to brighten the floors or surfaces we are trying to clean. We are literally shooting in the dark trying to get the areas clean and you would be amazed at just how much dirt and debris is left behind.This has been plaguing the cleaning industry for far too long. Quite often, cleaners work hard in poorly lit environments just to have the sun rise and reveal all the areas that were missed. Going back to retrace steps creates double work costing businesses time, energy and money.
 

 Illuminated cleaning tools bring light directly to surface areas you are cleaning.  Our first product is the BriteSweep broom. The broom has built-in LED lighting that provides sight in those dark or poorly lit areas that we didn’t have before. It is complete with two power buttons for ease of use. It has a detachable base for cleaning small messes and a blade set between the bristles to make cleaning wet debris much easier.The BriteSweep broom has a sleek low profile design, helping it to maneuver in tight spaces, and it looks good while you are using it ;) Features:LED lighting and a sleek, modern, low-profile design: Features:  Powered by only 2 AA Batteries: Detachable base for hand held use when cleaning small messes: Detach Action: “Precision Blade” for effortless cleaning, especially when cleaning wet debris:       The idea was born when Owner/CEO Mike Jackson was cleaning for one of many clients.  It was a restaurant with dim lighting.  Struggling to see in corners and under booths, frustration inspired him to create a better lighting situation.  Mike attached a flashlight to his broom and lights to his dustpan to help “shine some light” on the situation so he could see what he was cleaning.  His employees, company and friends loved the idea and immediately thought of the many ways a tool like this could make cleaning at home and in offices more effective. This initial idea was nice but didn’t directly get the light to the source without having to maneuver the light with one hand while trying to sweep with the other.  After some thought and consideration a design was created to make this job easier.OG prototype used by CEO to help clean that night :) Initial concept:Goal was to condense the lighting into the broom and turn it into a more powerful precision cleaning tool.Initial Concept Drawing: Redesign:Sleeker modern design that gives more clearance when sweeping under chairs, tables, corners, under cabinets, etc.Prototyping Process:We’re determined to provide quality products and went through rounds of design revisions to provide the best solution possible:Initial LED Tests:  Handmade prototype for testing: Handmade prototype: Exploring lighter, sleeker, more compact base designs: Test 3D prints and parts: 3D printed redesigned prototype 1.0:   BriteSweep is a branch of Mike Jackson LLC. Mike Jackson is the CEO of a large commercial cleaning business.  He started with virtually nothing and has worked diligently, sacrificing tremendously to help his business grow. Mike Jackson is a Retired Navy Senior Chief with 22 years of military service.He has diverse history that prepared him to be a business owner/innovator.

The ionic dryer gives your hair incredible shine, and when docked, it's the most effective way to dry your hands. Our designers have thought of every detail, from touch-free sensors to activate it without touching it (hello convenience), to integrated USB ports to charge your electric toothbrush & gadgets.  Did you know that a hand towel is a breeding ground for all kinds of yucky stuff? Ditch the towel and dry your hands with Breeze for clean hands that are well, truly clean. Breeze is is the most sanitary and environmentally friendly way to dry your hands. The built-in infrared sensor activates a constant stream of hot air when you place your hands underneath, making sure no dirty wet fingers ever touch it to turn it on. It's family-friendly, so even the kids can use it.  The extremely powerful but quiet motor produces an instant blast of hot air, drying your hands with incredible speed. Because the motor also powers the ionic hair dryer when you take it out, the hand dryer is also negative ion enabled, a unique benefit of having one motor that powers both.  Using paper towels every time you visit the bathroom ensures you'll have restock on new paper towels whenever you go to the supermarket. There's a smarter way to go about your business and that's Breeze. Using Breeze will reduce the number of towels your family goes through, which is better for the planet and your wallet.  You'd almost forget that Breeze isn't just an awesome hand dryer, but it's also a salon-worthy ionic hairdryer for the entire family. Enriched with negative ions, Breeze has settings for every hair type. From hot and powerful to ambient and gentle for the kids, the whole family will look their best every morning.  When used as a dryer, you can choose from six settings to give you perfectly shiny hair, just the way you like it. And comes with all the accessories you can expect from a salon-worthy product.Breeze is an ionic hair dryer, blasting more than a million negative ions into the air (and your hair) when you use it. Sounds fancy, but what exactly does it do? Negative ions help water evaporate faster, so you can use a lower heat, which is much better for your hair. Breeze leaves your hair looking shiny and healthy, and above all, dry in no time!Breeze incorporated six different fan settings to accommodate different types of hair. No matter your hair texture, Breeze will do the job.  Negative ions aren't just great for your hair, it actually cleans up the air in your bathroom too. It's no surprise that most hospitals have negative-ion air purifiers installed to rid the air of viruses and germs. When you dry your hands or hair with Breeze, more than a million negative ions are cleaning the air every minute you're using it.  You read that right, installing Breeze is a breeze! No screws or glue required, just stick the adhesive backing on any tile or glass surface for a mess-free installation in seconds. Screws are an option too if you want something a bit more permanent. You'll get everything you need in the box.   Breeze uses a Type I plug that is commonly used in Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, and Argentina. An adapter would be required for countries that use a different type of outlet. It doesn’t matter in what part of the world you live, Breeze will definitely work. Breeze was designed to make your bathroom look and feel like a 5-star hotel room. From the generous size, high-quality materials to the distinct color accents, nothing has been left to chance when designing Breeze. Breeze comes with convenient extra luxuries like USB chargers for your gadgets, an optional shelve for your toiletries, and invisible magnetic storage space for the hairdryer attachments. We have taken a bold approach to the engineering of what we think is the best possible product for your bathroom. It took some sleepless nights from our most senior engineers, but we built a product that we are extremely proud of, and we are confident you will love it too. The first batch has already come out of the factory and passed the strictest quality control test, both in our lab and at home.   We have four reward-tiers for you, be quick because quantities are limited.   We've already started pre-production of Breeze, and a previous model is currently being sold exclusively in some Asian countries, so we know how to make this product at scale. Here's what our timeline is looking like:If we manage to raise over $500,000 we will unlock an exclusive new color as a stretch goal.

Download them from here: DARU, TRIM Bluetooth, TRIM desktop.


Can I mess-up the assembly of the electronic parts?
Don’t worry, if you happen not to have electronic design skills. The modules cannot be assembled wrong since only the matching parts can be connected. Their form is just like a puzzle.

Do I need a driver to use my products?
No, just plug them in and start using them!

How can I choose the graphic design for my products?
After the end of the campaign we send you a form in which you can choose the graphics you like.

What happens if it contacts  water?

If you spill some water on them, don't worry, just wipe it off. These products are made of very high quality cardboard if they contact water for a short time, it does not make any harm. Of course if they contact water for a  longer time they can discolor or in extreme cases wrinkle
What tools do I need to assemble the products?
All assembly is tool-less, we pack you everithing you need to assemble your products.
What chargers can I use to power my gadgets?
You can use any microUSB mobile charger (5V1A DC) and you can plug them into any USB 2.0 or 3.0 slots in any computer.
I bought an add-on but I did not buy a product?
Unfortunately you can not get back your money from indiegogo, but you can still buy a product to utilize your already bought add-on.
How can I get my unique graphics printed on my products
You just need to send it to us. If it wont fit, we will try to fix it or you can choose an other one.

Can I mess-up the assembly of the product?
We send you a very detailed and comprehensive manual, and it is very easy anyway. Although if you make real effort to make it wrong, you can. But it can be fixed easily (see your manual)
I think I just messed-up the sticking, what do I do?
Don’t worry, you can tear it apart very carefully. To do this you can use a cuttter to help (see your manual)

Risks & Challenges

 We have already developed our products, so it is safe to say that we have no serious risks regarding functionality and technological feasibility. However it is always hard to get on the market with new products, especially with new electronics.
Our main challenge is to scale the production of the electronic modules. The more pledges we collect the easier for us to manufacture for a reasonable price.
Otherwise it is  pretty straight-forward at the beginning, we just need to get the ball rolling.

LumiSmart Design SketchesLumiSmart PrototypeCompare to the first prototype desk lamps; we relocated the temperature and humidity sensors behind the light in order to stop the error caused by the light. We also chose Beaglebone Black(link) as Open-source hardware(wiki). Considering the quality and the performance of the product, we used Samsung ARM S5PV210 SoC(System on Chip) for final production.Development BoardMain Board PCB ArtworkLumiSmart Block DiagramLumiSmart HomepageMilestoneTechnical Specification
Toaster : PaaS(Platform as a Service) over IoT(Internet of Things)
LumiSmart is one of good example that uses and applies Toaster platform.Toaster platform manages and controls Internet of Things devices, and LumiSmart is one of many IoT devices that’s manageable using Toaster platform. Also the platform is capable of collecting data from LumiSmart and other IoT devices, as well as providing environments, such as app store, and app authoring tool where any users and developers could make and distribute applications to invent new features on IoT devices.  Using Toaster platform will benefit users to manage and control their IoT devices effectively, while developers can expand and invent new features continuously using Toaster’s open APIs. Also, a business partner venture the new business opportunity using big data in Toaster platform.Toaster platform provides the following features

App Store


Visual app authoring tool


Device management


Data collection & Analytics


Providing RESTful API


Device Control

Toaster Cloud Platform has a vital role to connect among users and IoT devices, as well as to provide User Interface which user could manage IoT devices and their derived data efficiently. Also, Toaster provides an authoring tool to create app, and an app store to share created apps. On developer’s perspective, Toaster Cloud Platform provides RESTful APIs to enable multiple variations of application, and LumiSmart app uses these RESTful APIs to control LumiSmart.Toaster Device Platform is for various IoT Device like LumiSmart. It delegates all functions to other devices which make possible to collaborate with Toaster Cloud Platform. Connection Manager that’s responsible for maintaining connection with devices also provides real-time and duplex communicative network environments. Sensor Manager that’s responsible for sensor detection provides features to manage and collect IoT device’s sensor data. Toaster Device Platform extends its capacity and functionality by downloading and executing app from Toaster Cloud PlatformToaster Platform was created to be applied to as various IoT devices as possible. LumiSmart is just first IoT device and prototype which Toaster platform was applied.MagicEco aims to connect as many IoT devices as possible, while providing connectivity and diversity by connecting such devices.About UsLike any trends behaves, IT technology has evolved over time and it’s pretty hard to find any device around us not using software.  And as software evolves, people has realized that most important thing in developing software is to make better usability so that user experience is intuitive.  Even if any scenarios available are too complicated, one must feel any difficulty using the product.Based on such thoughts on how product and service should be applied, our second most important thing is to connect everything beautifully and intuitively. MagicEco was founded on these purposes. We aim these purposes by developing great platform and software that is capable of connecting things together, and that is scalable at the same time.To build and enhance performances of our MagicEco IoT platform, we put a lot of time and endeavor to invest in people.  MagicEco consists of skilled software/hardware engineers and creative talents from Samsung.

</ul>
<p>The collector size
sets the amount of snow at one pass you can clean, so we tried to make
the collector very big. The 5.5HP engine provides the necessary power to
the system. By putting front and back lights we increased the visibility. The flashing lights are to take even more attention. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chute has the
capacity to turn 360 degrees. The chute lights help you to see where
you are blowing when it is dark. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The auger is
designed to cut snow and the front bar works as a bumper. The 4 by 4
drive system provides the power to mobilize the robot and allows easy
turns and driving. The salt box controlled by the remote allows you
to throw salt while you clean the snow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the auger
design is completely innovative, we built a 3D prototype to see the
effectiveness of it. When testing the blades, washing soap was
used because the density and grain structure are similar to those of snow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gasoline
engine powers an alternator to generate the necessary electrical power
on the robot. The electrical energy runs the drive system, lights and electronics and it charges the batteries. The robot has a battery pack
to start the gasoline engine and to allow the user to drive the robot
for a short period of time so that the robot can be parked without
running the engine.</p>
<p>For safety, the
robot has an emergency button and the gasoline engine also can be
stopped from the remote control instantly.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is to get everything done on time. We scheduled
 for the app to be finished in about two months but we hope to be done 
sooner. There are some challenges that can barely be planned and they 
are the tricky ones. Testing the app balance, for example, can take much
 longer than predicted. We are all experienced in our field – but still:
 you never know what happens. We will hardly be fortunate enough not to 
encounter any obstacles but we promise to do our best to overcome them.</p>
<p>We are confident that we will master each and every challenge by the 
time we have to face it. We will also stay in contact with you and keep 
you updated throughout the whole process until the app is fully 
developed.</p>

dislike button on every webpage (Fb-App for Chrome and Firefox)Bored of reading things on Facebook like how everybody loves the book 
""Charlotte's Web"" or that their favorite hobbies are cooking and sports?
 Don't you think you could learn more about someone knowing what he does
 NOT want to do or watch or listen? With the Dizzlike Profile, you can 
share your least favorite movie, say which companies you boycott, or 
share the news you ""dizz""like.
This is what our dislike button looks like on Facebook.


This is what our dislike button looks like outside Facebook.The idea about Dizzlike came up on a Start-up weekend in Nuremberg, 
Germany. The idea then developed into Dizzlike Profile. People have been
 longing for a dislike button on Facebook and we want to give it to 
them. We did not, however, simply want to settle for a button - instead,
 we decided it would be neat to create an entire dislike-profile!We have now completed the Alpha version of the app 
where you can dizzlike, for example, cleaning, cancer, McDonald's or Justin 
Bieber. Try it out here: https://apps.facebook.com/dizzlikeprofilealpha/ Our alpha app doesn't need any permissions from you (only fb basics). Enjoy!Also visit our fb page and stay updated: Dizzlike ProfileDizzlike Profile is not the only idea we have in our minds. We have big 
plans for the Dizzlike concept and we plan to program a 
complex game in the future. Dizzlike Profile will be part of 'Dizzlike:the game', 
where your goal is to have as few friends as possible. But more on that 
in the future ;)Every now and then people joined our team when we told them about 
our concept. Now we are a funny bunch of all kinds of people.One day at a
 team meeting we decided to do a mini documentary to introduce us to 
the internet world. The video is quite old and it introduces the team of Dizzlike:the game. For the current project ""Dizzlike Profile"" the team has changed a little bit and for example, Maija (the voice in the video) is missing. But we hope you still enjoy our little video.For more info on our team and what we're doing, go to http://www.dizzlike.com/?p=13

<h3>Flexible and Powerful for Multiple Applications </h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>DLP stereolithography offers many advantages over the more common FFF/FDM 3D printing technology:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Resolution and Accuracy</b> - With the addition of an HD projector, Solus is able to print down to 25 micron XY resolution with features below 100 microns.</li>
<li>
<b>Surface Finish</b>  - With its smooth linear motion, stable construction, and low-energy peeling, Solus produces prints with a surface finish quality usually only found on much more expensive printers.</li>
<li>
<b>Print Speed</b> - The projector cures a complete layer at a single time so complexity is truly free.</li>
</ul>
<div>With these key features Solus works well for a wide variety of industries and applications: </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><ul>
<li><b>Research</b></li>
<li><b>Engineering</b></li>
<li><b>Jewelry</b></li>
<li><b>Design</b></li>
<li><b>Medical/Dental</b></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1010547/files/20141112230158-Print.jpg?1415862118"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Our Biggest Breakthrough</h3>
<div>Most other consumer SLA printers use either a PDMS silicon layer or an adhesive-backed Teflon film for their non-stick peeling surface. PDMS has great non-stick properties, but it can get cloudy or even break after just a few prints causing much frustration. Adhesive-backed Teflon can scatter the light, causing washed-out details or the Teflon can quickly separate from the tank bottom causing print failure.</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">To solve these issues Solus uses a durable film sourced from the semiconductor and flat-panel industries in combination with a patent-pending tilt peeling method. This smooth peeling and unscattered light transmission allow for sharper details, XY features below 100 microns and a very smooth surface finish. With this peeling method, we have also been able to print single objects that almost completely fill the build area (14.5 x 11 cm), all while eliminating the need to change or re-coat the resin tank.</span></div>

</div>
<br/>
<h3>Hardware and Software</h3><p>Solus is made from thick, laser-cut anodized aluminum and stainless steel components so it is strong, stable, and reliable. The z axis motor has an integrated lead screw with a professional quality anti-backlash nut for layer consistency and a smooth surface finish. The build platform and resin tank are fastened with quick release levers for easy removal. The extendable legs lock securely and there is a bubble level on the top plate to ensure a high print success rate.</p><p><b>No assembly required!</b></p><p>The software is user-friendly and has support generation. All of the print cycle settings (times, speeds and distances) are open so it can be used with the widest variety of resins or used for researching new materials.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1010554/files/20141112230746-Solus_1.jpg?1415862466"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>Projectors</h3><div><br/></div><p>Solus will work with most non-LED DLP projectors and the addition of a close-up filter and adapter, or in the case of the Acer H6510BD, straight out of the box. And since the projector is not enclosed inside of the printer, it can be used to watch movies when you're not printing. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; background-color: initial;"">It is also possible to modify the lens on many projectors to reduce the focus distance, but this will void the projector's warranty.</span></p><div><br/></div><div>

</div><div>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h3>Resolution and Build Area</h3>
</div><div>As with most DLP printers, the XY build area is dependent on the XY resolution you wish to print at. The maximum XY build area is 14.5 x 11 cm and the maximum height is 20cm. The extendable legs allow for a wide range of resolutions. For the projectors we have tested the resolutions and build areas are as follows:</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><strong>SVGA (800x600)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>70-180 micron XY resolution</li>
<li>5.6x4.2x20cm - 14.5x11x20cm build area</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><strong>XGA (1024x768)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>50-140 micron XY resolution</li>
<li>5.1x3.8x20cm - 14.5x11x20cm build area</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>HD (1920x1080)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>25-76 micron XY resolution*</li>
<li>4.8x2.7x20cm- 14.5x8.2x20cm build area</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">*25 micron XY resolution is not possible with all HD projectors.</span></p>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Native Z resolution is 10 microns, but less than 1 micron is available with 1/16 microstepping.</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<h3>Resins</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Solus has been well tested with resins from MakerJuice, Spot A Materials and our own formulations. The resin tank is made of acrylic and the peeling material is resistant to almost any chemical, so all resins that cure around 400nm should work. There are already a great variety of material choices ranging from ones as strong as ABS to flexible, castable and even ceramic filled, and we expect the list grow quickly as SLA printers gain in popularity. </div>

</div></div>","A Tool for Innovation Our goal at Reify 3D was to create an affordable stereolithography printer capable of producing professional quality prints while eliminating the major headache of most bottom-up SLA printers: poor peeling material durability. And we did it!

Flexible and Powerful for Multiple Applications 

DLP stereolithography offers many advantages over the more common FFF/FDM 3D printing technology:



Resolution and Accuracy - With the addition of an HD projector, Solus is able to print down to 25 micron XY resolution with features below 100 microns.

Surface Finish  - With its smooth linear motion, stable construction, and low-energy peeling, Solus produces prints with a surface finish quality usually only found on much more expensive printers.

Print Speed - The projector cures a complete layer at a single time so complexity is truly free.

With these key features Solus works well for a wide variety of industries and applications: 


Research
Engineering
Jewelry
Design
Medical/Dental









Our Biggest Breakthrough
Most other consumer SLA printers use either a PDMS silicon layer or an adhesive-backed Teflon film for their non-stick peeling surface. PDMS has great non-stick properties, but it can get cloudy or even break after just a few prints causing much frustration. Adhesive-backed Teflon can scatter the light, causing washed-out details or the Teflon can quickly separate from the tank bottom causing print failure.

To solve these issues Solus uses a durable film sourced from the semiconductor and flat-panel industries in combination with a patent-pending tilt peeling method. This smooth peeling and unscattered light transmission allow for sharper details, XY features below 100 microns and a very smooth surface finish. With this peeling method, we have also been able to print single objects that almost completely fill the build area (14.5 x 11 cm), all while eliminating the need to change or re-coat the resin tank.



 









Hardware and SoftwareSolus is made from thick, laser-cut anodized aluminum and stainless steel components so it is strong, stable, and reliable. The z axis motor has an integrated lead screw with a professional quality anti-backlash nut for layer consistency and a smooth surface finish. The build platform and resin tank are fastened with quick release levers for easy removal. The extendable legs lock securely and there is a bubble level on the top plate to ensure a high print success rate.No assembly required!The software is user-friendly and has support generation. All of the print cycle settings (times, speeds and distances) are open so it can be used with the widest variety of resins or used for researching new materials.ProjectorsSolus will work with most non-LED DLP projectors and the addition of a close-up filter and adapter, or in the case of the Acer H6510BD, straight out of the box. And since the projector is not enclosed inside of the printer, it can be used to watch movies when you're not printing. It is also possible to modify the lens on many projectors to reduce the focus distance, but this will void the projector's warranty.

Monger Designs - Lattice Ring with 300 micron  wire mesh


Resolution and Build Area
As with most DLP printers, the XY build area is dependent on the XY resolution you wish to print at. The maximum XY build area is 14.5 x 11 cm and the maximum height is 20cm. The extendable legs allow for a wide range of resolutions. For the projectors we have tested the resolutions and build areas are as follows:
SVGA (800x600)

70-180 micron XY resolution
5.6x4.2x20cm - 14.5x11x20cm build area


XGA (1024x768)

50-140 micron XY resolution
5.1x3.8x20cm - 14.5x11x20cm build area


HD (1920x1080)

25-76 micron XY resolution*
4.8x2.7x20cm- 14.5x8.2x20cm build area



*25 micron XY resolution is not possible with all HD projectors.
Native Z resolution is 10 microns, but less than 1 micron is available with 1/16 microstepping.

Resins

Solus has been well tested with resins from MakerJuice, Spot A Materials and our own formulations. The resin tank is made of acrylic and the peeling material is resistant to almost any chemical, so all resins that cure around 400nm should work. There are already a great variety of material choices ranging from ones as strong as ABS to flexible, castable and even ceramic filled, and we expect the list grow quickly as SLA printers gain in popularity. 

During the campaign, we plan to test resins from other manufacturers, as well as casting resins.

Risks & Challenges
Solus has been designed for ease of manufacturing and the laser cutter does most of the hard work. Agreements have been reached with the major part suppliers and alternative suppliers have been located if necessary. Being located in one of the high-tech manufacturing hotspots of the world, we are fortunate to be surrounded by a vast selection of component suppliers, machine shops and contract manufacturers.

Maybe you have heard of Local Motors world's first 3D printed car in 2014 SEMA. This year at 2015 SEMA, Local Motors is <a href=""https://localmotors.com/localmotors/road-ready-3d-printed-car/activity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unveiling a whole version designed</a> to be mass produced (or we should say printed) in microfactories around the US and globally in near future. XKchrome is being used in one of the first concept car. Together with IBM cloud and other IoT (Internet of Things) technology, the lights can do a lot more than just decoration. For example, the underglow can strobe in amber when an accident has happened, or the interior ambient light can slightly glow red to remind you are over speed limit. We are very excited to see what people can do with XKchrome technology.

In 2010, when we first saw a smartphone controlled drone on the internet, we knew a new era of app-enabled hardware was coming. Despite the little resources we had, two generations of app controlled automobile led lights have been born since 2011. In 2014, with two passionate makers Haogang (PhD in Computer Science) and Richard (creator of OSEMO) joining the team, we set out to develop XKchrome, the world's coolest lights for automobiles.</p><p>We pumped all the experience and feedback gathered from the previous models into XKchrome, and integrated them with the most advanced BLE and iBeacon technology to make it meet our highest standards. After many sleepless nights and a couple factory visits, all hardware and app development have been completed and we are currently preparing for the first batch of production by working closely with the manufacturer, which has produced many products for the world's top 500 companies.</p><p><b>Special thanks to:</b></p><ul>

XKchrome on world's first production 3D printed car
Maybe you have heard of Local Motors world's first 3D printed car in 2014 SEMA. This year at 2015 SEMA, Local Motors is unveiling a whole version designed to be mass produced (or we should say printed) in microfactories around the US and globally in near future. XKchrome is being used in one of the first concept car. Together with IBM cloud and other IoT (Internet of Things) technology, the lights can do a lot more than just decoration. For example, the underglow can strobe in amber when an accident has happened, or the interior ambient light can slightly glow red to remind you are over speed limit. We are very excited to see what people can do with XKchrome technology. And we would love to see what you will do with XKchrome in the coming months.Brake light visibility is the top concern for motorcycle safety at night. Now with the integrated Smart Brake sensor, XKchrome can turn the entire motorcycle body into a brake light! As soon as you apply the brake, XKchrome immediately switches all LED lights on in red. This significantly increases the bike's visibility, and promotes faster reaction of the vehicle behind.**The Smart Break feature comes in EVERY XKchrome kit. All you need to do is simply attaching a wire to the positive line of break light or break fuse. Capture A Color, Paint With Light.With XKchrome's realtime ""chameleon"" feature, you can paint your ride with any color you see. Whether it's a stunning new shirt or a beautiful sunflower, just point your phone's camera to it. XKchrome instantly turns your vehicle into the very same eye-catching color, without even a finger tap. Be prepared to be in AWE!Sync Lights With MusicMusic is the essence of life; and we make it the essence of light. XKchrome's Music Sync feature enables lights to dance with the rhythm of any song in your phone, or with any sound picked up by the microphone. To maximize visual effect, our adaptive algorithm dynamically adjusts the volume sensitivity. No matter if it's a country music or a hard rock, just lay back and enjoy the full spectrum you defined for your favorite song.16 Million Colors at Your Fingertip & Dual-zone ControlBuilt with 16 bit gamma correction, XKchrome provides over 16 million vibrant colors, allowing the user to choose any color with a single tap. Each controller has two zones that can simultaneously run different colors and patterns, allowing more room for creativity and uniqueness. Up to 4 controllers (8 zones) can be connected at the same time.Holiday Themes & Simple DIY Theme-creatorOur color designer hand-picked over 15 themes for special occasions throughout the year. In addition, users can fully customize their own themes with various pattern, speed, and up to 10 color combinations.XKchrome can do more than lighting. Thanks to its built-in Bluetooth Smart Beacon, XKchrome helps locate your parked vehicle. When you walk away after parking, XKchrome app will automatically pin down your location. So that you can easily look it up in the app when you need to find the way back. Once you get close enough, you can also turn on the lights to single your vehicle out from the endless parking row.Gamma Color CorrectionTo make XKchrome worth its name, color accuracy is among our top goals. XKchrome is the first lighting kit that features 16-bit high precision gamma correction, a technology previously only used in studio-level LED monitors. Compared to most other LED lighting products in the market, our industry-leading technology delivers much more vivid color and smoother color transitions.WaterproofAs designers we never compromise on quality. It is our job, not yours, to prepare XKchrome for the toughest days. That is why we've designed XKchrome to be completely waterproof. The controller is sealed in an ultra-slim, elegant-looking enclosure. The innovative touch sensing button on the top of the enclosure ensures a seamless response. We rigorously test our final products to make sure that no moisture can go inside even when the entire controller is soaked in the water.DimensionsFully functioning XKchrome iOS and Android app available for download now.As designer and maker, Eric and Dan started the LED automobile lighting company called XK GLOW in 2009 (during the peak of financial crisis) from a small dorm room at the University of Illinois. In 2010, when we first saw a smartphone controlled drone on the internet, we knew a new era of app-enabled hardware was coming. Despite the little resources we had, two generations of app controlled automobile led lights have been born since 2011. In 2014, with two passionate makers Haogang (PhD in Computer Science) and Richard (creator of OSEMO) joining the team, we set out to develop XKchrome, the world's coolest lights for automobiles.We pumped all the experience and feedback gathered from the previous models into XKchrome, and integrated them with the most advanced BLE and iBeacon technology to make it meet our highest standards. After many sleepless nights and a couple factory visits, all hardware and app development have been completed and we are currently preparing for the first batch of production by working closely with the manufacturer, which has produced many products for the world's top 500 companies.Special thanks to:
