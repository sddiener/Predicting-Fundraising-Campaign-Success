<p><strong>What makes it a ""Hybrid Board""?</strong> <br/>We heard the call of riders who wanted a power-assist function for up hills and long commutes, but who insist that <strong>PUSHING</strong> and <strong>PUMPING</strong> are still essential elements of all skateboarding.  In response, we designed a hub-motor drivetrain and board design that is easier to push and pump than any electric skateboard you've tried, period. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dualomo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PUSH_UPHILL.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br/>We started with a brushless motor design which, unlike most electric boards, uses NO belts or gears that slow you down.  We spent over a year developing and refining our system, which dramatically reduces the drag and friction found in most brushless motor designs. For a crucial final touch we partnered with <a href=""http://www.bustinboards.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bustin Boards</a> to create an ultra-light, ultra-low, ultra-skate-friendly board and setup to make this the <strong>easiest electric board you'll ever push</strong> whether the power is on or off. </p>
<p>It's a <u>powerful electric vehicle</u> when you want it to be while maintaining the feel and responsiveness of a <u>high-performance traditional longboard</u>.  Hence we dubbed it the<strong> ""Dualomo Hybrid""</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536072703/skow1peu30v4eexgwoqv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>   </p>
<h3><strong>Different From The Ground Up</strong></h3>
<p>We rode every brand-name electric board on the market and were left bored time after time.  <strong>None of them pushed, pumped or carved like the traditional boards we were used to.</strong>  They were stiff, heavy and unresponsive;  and generally made us feel like crash test dummies riding on the hood of a lawnmower holding a Wii controller (you get the point).  </p>
<p>We had a vision for something more lively, more practical and more like a skateboard.  Tired of waiting, we began developing our own design and technology.  After a year of perfecting our electronics, we teamed up with Bustin Boards to create a board unlike anything we've seen before;  <strong>a hard-carving, push-friendly, ultra-fast hybrid electric skateboard</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dualomo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MAIN_ANIM.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">“I have been skating longer than electric boards have been a thing but it’s always been a concept that fascinated me. The dream of effortlessly coasting back up to the top of the run on the same board you ripped down it always seemed like the perfect way to maximize your actual skate time. As E-Boards have quickly become a thing in today’s market, no boards until the Dualomo quite met the qualifications demanded by my self and other real skaters out there. Finally, we now have a fully functional skateboard that can double as a commute crushing machine.”<br/><strong>Josh - Apex, NC</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“I definitely had a blast with the hybrid board. I loved its ability to shoot quickly up hills and just its over all speed was awesome. The fact that it can be used as a traditional longboard is sick!”<br/><strong>Riley - Greencastle PA</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“As a guy in my mid 40’s, I had the opportunity to test the new Dualomo Hybrid recently.  I’m a longtime supporter of the longboard culture but given work, family and lots of other competing interests have never found the time to ride much.  The new board instantly captured my attention.  The ride was smooth, effortless and incredibly intuitive.  With other electric rides that I’ve tested, the motor noticeably slowed downhill cruising.  This board is like riding a non-powered setup down the hills in my hometown.  I can definitely see using this for years to come, both as a weekend ride and even a daily commuter for my trip to work.” <br/><strong>Kris - Park City, UT</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""I had a bunch of longboards in high school and college but, at 23, I thought I had outgrown the stage.  The Dualomo brought back everything I loved about longboarding and more.  Thanks for letting me demo the board and I'll definitely be picking one up to ride to work!""<br/><strong>Meghan - Mclean, VA</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""I didn't know what to expect from an electric board after being a traditional skateboarder my whole life.  Honestly its much more fun that I ever expected.  It reminds of snowboarding, skating and surfer all rolled into one.  The quality of everything was great and the power was tremendous, even up hill.""<br/><strong>Mike - Hagerstown, MD</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""I've been skating since the 1970's and have seen a lot of changes in the industry.  By far, the most exciting is the evolution to an electric-power board that I can ride downhill, push on flat ground, as well as glide up hills!  When I'm on the Dualomo, I feel like I'm surfing an endless wave.  Carving turns down hills, pushing through town, or ripping up inclines give the same feelings of freedom that caused me to fall in love with skateboarding!  There are many options out there for electric boards, but the way that the Dualomo carves is second to none.  I recommend this board to anyone, from beginners to those riding for years.""<br/><strong>John - Vienna, VA</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>When does my board deliver?</u></strong><br/>As many of our you have heard we've made great strides on our manufacturing and are now shipping in January 2019.  We are aware that some of the perk items still read ""March 2019"".  This is because we CANNOT alter the written details of products that have already been purchased.  REST ASSURED, that we are aiming to ship ALL boards ordered through the campaign in January!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Why did you make it?</u></strong><br/>As riders, we've watched as the race towards tech has over-shadowed a clear lack of functional design in every new electric board to hit the market.  Like all skaters, snowboarders and surfers, we have dreamt of the perpetual concrete wave.  We were excited about the innovations we saw with electric boards, but every new option to hit the market left us bored time after time.  Before long all of the brand-name, expensive boards we thought we'd love ended up unused, piled in the back of our garage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It was then that we realized that it was our calling to make a GREAT electric board that skated like a GREAT skateboard or longboard.  Two years later, here we are and we could not be more proud and excited to bring the Dualomo Hybrid to all of you!  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>I see you have 3 models, which is the right one for me?</strong></u><br/>This is a question we are getting a lot and its kind of hard to answer.  Some of it depends on your budget and some of depends on your needs for speed/range.  Like all inventors, we started out aiming for the moon and wanted to produce a board with better specs than our competition.  After about 10 prototypes and thousands of tests and tweaks, we achieved that with the Hybrid-X.  However, soon after we unveiled pricing to our social media followers, we heard from many of you that you wanted an economical version.  Some of you said you just actually didn't WANT to go 25mph (a reasonable opinion, especially for beginners and young riders).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In response, we managed to pair back the technology and save quite a bit of cost in doing so.  This gave us the ability to offer lower-cost, slower-speed models that are built with the same components and technology as our top board, the Hybrid-X.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Do all three models use the same board?</strong></u><br/>YES, all three models (Hybrid-E, Hybrid-S and Hybrid-X) use the exact same board from Bustin Boards, a custom 35"" Sportster board made with Bustin's signature ThermoGlass™ and (E)Core™ construction.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Do all three models use the same components?</strong></u><br/>Almost.  All three boards use genuine Paris™ Trucks and Five-O™ wheels.  The Hybrid-X and Hybrid-S both use Bustin CERAMIC bearings, while the Hybrid-E uses Bustin Abec-9 bearings.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Does the board use a controller like other electric skateboards?</strong></u><br/>Yes it does.  We designed the controller with a familiar feel for all of you e-skaters, but made it small enough to stash in your pocket when you're pushing the board manually.  Most likely you'll keep it in hand as you develop your PUSH/POWER rhythm of your hybrid skate.  The controller has two speed settings and also comes with a nifty wrist strap so you don't drop it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Do I have to be an experienced skateboarder or longboarder to ride it?</strong></u><br/>Absolutely not.  Most people are surprised to hear that its easier to learn on an electric skateboard than on a regular one.  Use the kids/beginner setting to learn how to keep your balance and carve.  As you get more comfortable, start practicing your push and before you know it you'll be ready to hit the skate park (well maybe not that quite yet).  Whether you're a seasoned pro looking to get less sweaty on your long commutes or a brand newbie who's never set foot on a skateboard, we promise that you can learn how to ride this board!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>What’s the deal with the PUSH feature?  How does that work exactly?</strong></u><br/>Unlike other electric skateboards, the Dualomo Hybrid allows for a more natural manual push (with your legs and feet that is) whether the board is turned OFF or ON.  This makes it 1000% more like a normal skateboard or longboard;  and less like one of those people mover belts at airports. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We appreciate the Push-Function most when we're starting our rides.  Simply drop your board and push away just like you would on your skateboard or longboard.  All of the curious folks around you won't realize its an electric board until you decide to push the throttle and accelerate out of sight (They'll be scratching their heads wondering how you did that all day)!  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Push-Function is also GREAT for conserving battery life.  Taking a slow detour through the park where it is mostly flat ground, people-weaving-type skating?  Thats a great place to get some pushes in and find the ole' skate rhythm as you duck and weave curious pedestrians.  The more you push, the longer that battery will last so don't be shy.   And of course, if your battery ever does die, you'll be able to push home :)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>How exactly does the push-friendly hub-motor work?</strong></u><br/>First of all, we use a brushless hub-motor design that DOES NOT use belts or gears like most electric boards.  Boards that use gears are belts have a much harder time pushing freely.  Doing so is essentially like winding a huge clock or manually turning the engine in your car.  To make one part move, you must also extend that power through a series of gears and/or belts to make other parts move.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Within the world of hub-motors, which use no belts or gears, there is a still a range of resistance that exists.  Some hub-motors won't turn at all without a power currency running through them.  Ours, on the other hand, is specially tuned to spin with less resistance whether the board is turned OFF or ON.  Because a hub-motor works using magnets, it is impossible to remove ALL resistance from the wheel, but we've pulled out every stop to create a motor that minimizes this resistance to the point where the board can be easily pushed like a regular skateboard.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">One obvious, but notable point here is that the board itself is naturally a bit heavier than a standard longboard because of the battery, motor, circuit board and cover.  We've done our best to make the board one of the lightest electric boards on the market, but it's not realistic to compare it to a board WITHOUT the electric compenents.  In other words, if you have a traditional Bustin Sportster and you're expecting this one to feel exactly the same, you might be disappointed.  Just as if you took a Porsche 911 and compared it to the same 911 towing one of those awesome little pop-up campers things.  It's still a great ride, but remember you're now towing some extra weight to get the power you need.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>How is the deck itself designed to be more push-friendly?</strong></u><br/>Bustin Boards designed this modified version of their Sportster Board specifically to compliment Dualomo's push-friendly design.  One of the things that makes the board easier to push is the design of the deck, which offers an ultra low double-dropped platform.  The original Sportster design was created as a pure PUSH/FREERIDE design, meaning that the deck is made to push and carve hard.  To allow for such a low board design we had a to make the battery and circuit boards ultra thin to provide enough clearance for every day skating.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>I dig it, how can I order my Dualomo Hybrid now?</u></strong><br/>Right now only way to get the Dualomo Hybrid is to order through THIS Indiegogo campaign.  People who back this campaign will not only be the first in the world to own the Dualomo, but they'll also save of money off of the future retail price which will land somewhere around $1800 in stores.  To get your Dualomo Hybrid (now delivers in January 2019), here's what to do:<br/>         - Go to the RIGHT side of the project page and click <strong>BACK THIS PROJECT</strong>.<br/>         - Select the <strong>PERK</strong> package you want and order through the secure Indiegogo checkout page.<br/>         - And just like that, you have become one of the first people in the world to own the Dualomo Hybrid board.  We'll keep you updated via email and the updates section of the campaign.  For exact dates, please take a look at the Timeline just above this section ^.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>How much maintenance does the Dualomo Hybrid board, battery and motor require?</u></strong><br/>Basically none.  We ask that you FULLY CHARGE the battery when you receive the board.  Beyond, just keep it out from under the wheels of dump trucks and try not to drop it out of your helicopter.  Obviously there are more than a few ways to destroy a skateboard, but we've designed the Dualomo Hybrid to stand up to most forms of normal wear and tear without needing much maintainance at all.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>How can I buy accessories such as extra wheels, replacement controllers, etc?</strong></u><br/>After the campaign ends we’ll be launching our online store <a href=""http://www.dualomo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dualomo.com</a> where you can buy spare parts and accessories for the Dualomo Hybrid. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?</strong></u><br/>We are creating the board using a variety of a voltage adapters.  You will receive the charger that works in your specific country based on where your board is shipping to.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>The board is really expensive, but the Indiegogo deal is awesome.  Please explain?</strong></u><br/>We believe our board exceeds the quality of any other board on the planet, but we know we are a small company building our dream from humble roots.  This Indiegogo campaign is the very first launch of a project we've been working on for more than 2 years.  We NEED community support to fund full-scale production so that we can compete with the big dogs.  To do that, we're offering our supporters our break-even price so that we can cover the cost of the boards and production setup.  After the campaign our normal price will be more in-line with most of the top brands in the industry.  That makes now a good time to help us help you :)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Can I order the Dualomo Hybrid even though I do not live in the USA?  </u></strong><br/>Yes, for sure!  We ship worldwide for a flat-rate price of $75.  Shipping within the USA is $35.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Is the Dualomo Hybrid delivered assembled and ready to ride?</strong></u><br/>Yes, for sure.  Your board will be delivered fully assembled and ready to rip.  All that we ask is that you FULLY charge the battery before riding.  This assures for a long, happy life for your battery.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>How much weight can the Dualomo Hybrid handle?  </u></strong><br/>We've tested the board up to 300 lbs with no problems.  However, please bear in mind that the speed and battery range are affected by both rider weight and terrain conditions.  If you are a heavy rider, your speed and range results may be a bit lower than someone who is smaller.  It doesn't make it less fun, but that's something you need to know if you're one of the great danes reading this.</p>

This campaign is closed but you can still order through www.bustinboards.com - https://bustinboards.com/products/dualomo-hybrid-pre-order

Meet the Dualomo™ Hybrid, the world’s first electric board that pushes, carves & pumps more like a traditional board while ALSO offering a high-performance electric mode that rivals any e-board on the market.  
THE CAMPAIGN IS CLOSED, BUT YOU CAN STILL ORDER THROUGH WWW.BUSTINBOARDS.COM.
Designed and produced in collaboration with Bustin Boards Co, a 17-year-old specialty skateboard company founded in Brooklyn, NY with more than 50,000 customers worldwide!  
Hand-crafted in the USA with components from the best brands in the industry!  The Dualomo™ Hybrid board is hand-made and hand-assembled in the USA, with more than 70% of raw materials & parts sourced domestically.    We're proud and confident to work with awesome brands like Bustin Boards, Paris Trucks, Five-O Wheels and Samsung!  Follow us on Instagram and Facebook to follow our manufacturing process!

What makes it a ""Hybrid Board""? We heard the call of riders who wanted a power-assist function for up hills and long commutes, but who insist that PUSHING and PUMPING are still essential elements of all skateboarding.  In response, we designed a hub-motor drivetrain and board design that is easier to push and pump than any electric skateboard you've tried, period. 

How does it work?We started with a brushless motor design which, unlike most electric boards, uses NO belts or gears that slow you down.  We spent over a year developing and refining our system, which dramatically reduces the drag and friction found in most brushless motor designs. For a crucial final touch we partnered with Bustin Boards to create an ultra-light, ultra-low, ultra-skate-friendly board and setup to make this the easiest electric board you'll ever push whether the power is on or off. 
It's a powerful electric vehicle when you want it to be while maintaining the feel and responsiveness of a high-performance traditional longboard.  Hence we dubbed it the ""Dualomo Hybrid"".

   
Different From The Ground Up
We rode every brand-name electric board on the market and were left bored time after time.  None of them pushed, pumped or carved like the traditional boards we were used to.  They were stiff, heavy and unresponsive;  and generally made us feel like crash test dummies riding on the hood of a lawnmower holding a Wii controller (you get the point).  
We had a vision for something more lively, more practical and more like a skateboard.  Tired of waiting, we began developing our own design and technology.  After a year of perfecting our electronics, we teamed up with Bustin Boards to create a board unlike anything we've seen before;  a hard-carving, push-friendly, ultra-fast hybrid electric skateboard.

Today the final production model is complete and we are ready to change the way real riders think about electric skateboards.  The Dualomo™ Hybrid will be hand-crafted in the USA with 70% of raw parts sourced here, making it a safe bet for our backers!  All of our tooling and molds are COMPLETE and we're ready to roll with final production in October, with ALL boards shipping in March (or sooner)!    
The Dualomo™ Hybrid WILL SHIP WORLDWIDE from our US-based production facility.  International shipping is just $75 and we will use FedEx™ Air for fast, reliable delivery.  Also, if you live in the USA, shipping is just $25!
Help us get it off the ground here on Indiegogo and we'll reward you with a deal that will make your friends jealous for years to come.  Thanks!

HOW THE DUALOMO HYBRID-X MODEL STACKS UP TO COMPETITION




 
RIDER TESTIMONIALS
Follow us on Instagram & Facebook for your chance to demo the Dualomo Hybrid.
“I have been skating longer than electric boards have been a thing but it’s always been a concept that fascinated me. The dream of effortlessly coasting back up to the top of the run on the same board you ripped down it always seemed like the perfect way to maximize your actual skate time. As E-Boards have quickly become a thing in today’s market, no boards until the Dualomo quite met the qualifications demanded by my self and other real skaters out there. Finally, we now have a fully functional skateboard that can double as a commute crushing machine.”Josh - Apex, NC
“I definitely had a blast with the hybrid board. I loved its ability to shoot quickly up hills and just its over all speed was awesome. The fact that it can be used as a traditional longboard is sick!”Riley - Greencastle PA
“As a guy in my mid 40’s, I had the opportunity to test the new Dualomo Hybrid recently.  I’m a longtime supporter of the longboard culture but given work, family and lots of other competing interests have never found the time to ride much.  The new board instantly captured my attention.  The ride was smooth, effortless and incredibly intuitive.  With other electric rides that I’ve tested, the motor noticeably slowed downhill cruising.  This board is like riding a non-powered setup down the hills in my hometown.  I can definitely see using this for years to come, both as a weekend ride and even a daily commuter for my trip to work.” Kris - Park City, UT
""I had a bunch of longboards in high school and college but, at 23, I thought I had outgrown the stage.  The Dualomo brought back everything I loved about longboarding and more.  Thanks for letting me demo the board and I'll definitely be picking one up to ride to work!""Meghan - Mclean, VA
""I didn't know what to expect from an electric board after being a traditional skateboarder my whole life.  Honestly its much more fun that I ever expected.  It reminds of snowboarding, skating and surfer all rolled into one.  The quality of everything was great and the power was tremendous, even up hill.""Mike - Hagerstown, MD
""I've been skating since the 1970's and have seen a lot of changes in the industry.  By far, the most exciting is the evolution to an electric-power board that I can ride downhill, push on flat ground, as well as glide up hills!  When I'm on the Dualomo, I feel like I'm surfing an endless wave.  Carving turns down hills, pushing through town, or ripping up inclines give the same feelings of freedom that caused me to fall in love with skateboarding!  There are many options out there for electric boards, but the way that the Dualomo carves is second to none.  I recommend this board to anyone, from beginners to those riding for years.""John - Vienna, VA



Frequently Asked Questions
 
When does my board deliver?As many of our you have heard we've made great strides on our manufacturing and are now shipping in January 2019.  We are aware that some of the perk items still read ""March 2019"".  This is because we CANNOT alter the written details of products that have already been purchased.  REST ASSURED, that we are aiming to ship ALL boards ordered through the campaign in January!
Why did you make it?As riders, we've watched as the race towards tech has over-shadowed a clear lack of functional design in every new electric board to hit the market.  Like all skaters, snowboarders and surfers, we have dreamt of the perpetual concrete wave.  We were excited about the innovations we saw with electric boards, but every new option to hit the market left us bored time after time.  Before long all of the brand-name, expensive boards we thought we'd love ended up unused, piled in the back of our garage.
It was then that we realized that it was our calling to make a GREAT electric board that skated like a GREAT skateboard or longboard.  Two years later, here we are and we could not be more proud and excited to bring the Dualomo Hybrid to all of you!  
 
I see you have 3 models, which is the right one for me?This is a question we are getting a lot and its kind of hard to answer.  Some of it depends on your budget and some of depends on your needs for speed/range.  Like all inventors, we started out aiming for the moon and wanted to produce a board with better specs than our competition.  After about 10 prototypes and thousands of tests and tweaks, we achieved that with the Hybrid-X.  However, soon after we unveiled pricing to our social media followers, we heard from many of you that you wanted an economical version.  Some of you said you just actually didn't WANT to go 25mph (a reasonable opinion, especially for beginners and young riders).
In response, we managed to pair back the technology and save quite a bit of cost in doing so.  This gave us the ability to offer lower-cost, slower-speed models that are built with the same components and technology as our top board, the Hybrid-X.
 
Do all three models use the same board?YES, all three models (Hybrid-E, Hybrid-S and Hybrid-X) use the exact same board from Bustin Boards, a custom 35"" Sportster board made with Bustin's signature ThermoGlass™ and (E)Core™ construction.  
 
Do all three models use the same components?Almost.  All three boards use genuine Paris™ Trucks and Five-O™ wheels.  The Hybrid-X and Hybrid-S both use Bustin CERAMIC bearings, while the Hybrid-E uses Bustin Abec-9 bearings.  
 
Does the board use a controller like other electric skateboards?Yes it does.  We designed the controller with a familiar feel for all of you e-skaters, but made it small enough to stash in your pocket when you're pushing the board manually.  Most likely you'll keep it in hand as you develop your PUSH/POWER rhythm of your hybrid skate.  The controller has two speed settings and also comes with a nifty wrist strap so you don't drop it.
 
Do I have to be an experienced skateboarder or longboarder to ride it?Absolutely not.  Most people are surprised to hear that its easier to learn on an electric skateboard than on a regular one.  Use the kids/beginner setting to learn how to keep your balance and carve.  As you get more comfortable, start practicing your push and before you know it you'll be ready to hit the skate park (well maybe not that quite yet).  Whether you're a seasoned pro looking to get less sweaty on your long commutes or a brand newbie who's never set foot on a skateboard, we promise that you can learn how to ride this board!
 
What’s the deal with the PUSH feature?  How does that work exactly?Unlike other electric skateboards, the Dualomo Hybrid allows for a more natural manual push (with your legs and feet that is) whether the board is turned OFF or ON.  This makes it 1000% more like a normal skateboard or longboard;  and less like one of those people mover belts at airports. 
We appreciate the Push-Function most when we're starting our rides.  Simply drop your board and push away just like you would on your skateboard or longboard.  All of the curious folks around you won't realize its an electric board until you decide to push the throttle and accelerate out of sight (They'll be scratching their heads wondering how you did that all day)!  
The Push-Function is also GREAT for conserving battery life.  Taking a slow detour through the park where it is mostly flat ground, people-weaving-type skating?  Thats a great place to get some pushes in and find the ole' skate rhythm as you duck and weave curious pedestrians.  The more you push, the longer that battery will last so don't be shy.   And of course, if your battery ever does die, you'll be able to push home :)
 
How exactly does the push-friendly hub-motor work?First of all, we use a brushless hub-motor design that DOES NOT use belts or gears like most electric boards.  Boards that use gears are belts have a much harder time pushing freely.  Doing so is essentially like winding a huge clock or manually turning the engine in your car.  To make one part move, you must also extend that power through a series of gears and/or belts to make other parts move.  
Within the world of hub-motors, which use no belts or gears, there is a still a range of resistance that exists.  Some hub-motors won't turn at all without a power currency running through them.  Ours, on the other hand, is specially tuned to spin with less resistance whether the board is turned OFF or ON.  Because a hub-motor works using magnets, it is impossible to remove ALL resistance from the wheel, but we've pulled out every stop to create a motor that minimizes this resistance to the point where the board can be easily pushed like a regular skateboard.
One obvious, but notable point here is that the board itself is naturally a bit heavier than a standard longboard because of the battery, motor, circuit board and cover.  We've done our best to make the board one of the lightest electric boards on the market, but it's not realistic to compare it to a board WITHOUT the electric compenents.  In other words, if you have a traditional Bustin Sportster and you're expecting this one to feel exactly the same, you might be disappointed.  Just as if you took a Porsche 911 and compared it to the same 911 towing one of those awesome little pop-up campers things.  It's still a great ride, but remember you're now towing some extra weight to get the power you need.
 
How is the deck itself designed to be more push-friendly?Bustin Boards designed this modified version of their Sportster Board specifically to compliment Dualomo's push-friendly design.  One of the things that makes the board easier to push is the design of the deck, which offers an ultra low double-dropped platform.  The original Sportster design was created as a pure PUSH/FREERIDE design, meaning that the deck is made to push and carve hard.  To allow for such a low board design we had a to make the battery and circuit boards ultra thin to provide enough clearance for every day skating.  
 
I dig it, how can I order my Dualomo Hybrid now?Right now only way to get the Dualomo Hybrid is to order through THIS Indiegogo campaign.  People who back this campaign will not only be the first in the world to own the Dualomo, but they'll also save of money off of the future retail price which will land somewhere around $1800 in stores.  To get your Dualomo Hybrid (now delivers in January 2019), here's what to do:         - Go to the RIGHT side of the project page and click BACK THIS PROJECT.         - Select the PERK package you want and order through the secure Indiegogo checkout page.         - And just like that, you have become one of the first people in the world to own the Dualomo Hybrid board.  We'll keep you updated via email and the updates section of the campaign.  For exact dates, please take a look at the Timeline just above this section ^.
 
How much maintenance does the Dualomo Hybrid board, battery and motor require?Basically none.  We ask that you FULLY CHARGE the battery when you receive the board.  Beyond, just keep it out from under the wheels of dump trucks and try not to drop it out of your helicopter.  Obviously there are more than a few ways to destroy a skateboard, but we've designed the Dualomo Hybrid to stand up to most forms of normal wear and tear without needing much maintainance at all.
 
How can I buy accessories such as extra wheels, replacement controllers, etc?After the campaign ends we’ll be launching our online store www.dualomo.com where you can buy spare parts and accessories for the Dualomo Hybrid. 
 
Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?We are creating the board using a variety of a voltage adapters.  You will receive the charger that works in your specific country based on where your board is shipping to.
 
The board is really expensive, but the Indiegogo deal is awesome.  Please explain?We believe our board exceeds the quality of any other board on the planet, but we know we are a small company building our dream from humble roots.  This Indiegogo campaign is the very first launch of a project we've been working on for more than 2 years.  We NEED community support to fund full-scale production so that we can compete with the big dogs.  To do that, we're offering our supporters our break-even price so that we can cover the cost of the boards and production setup.  After the campaign our normal price will be more in-line with most of the top brands in the industry.  That makes now a good time to help us help you :)
 
Can I order the Dualomo Hybrid even though I do not live in the USA?  Yes, for sure!  We ship worldwide for a flat-rate price of $75.  Shipping within the USA is $35.
 
Is the Dualomo Hybrid delivered assembled and ready to ride?Yes, for sure.  Your board will be delivered fully assembled and ready to rip.  All that we ask is that you FULLY charge the battery before riding.  This assures for a long, happy life for your battery.
 
How much weight can the Dualomo Hybrid handle?  We've tested the board up to 300 lbs with no problems.  However, please bear in mind that the speed and battery range are affected by both rider weight and terrain conditions.  If you are a heavy rider, your speed and range results may be a bit lower than someone who is smaller.  It doesn't make it less fun, but that's something you need to know if you're one of the great danes reading this.
 
I live in the suburbs, is the Dualomo Hybrid a good choice for me?  Or is it only good for hipster city dwellers?Yes, of course.  Well, let's rephrase that as ""probably heck yeah!""  We designed the Dualomo Hybrid to surf the landscape whether you live in a suburban American neighborhood or in a downtown Hong Kong high-rise.  This board WILL change your life and make your car less important in most cases. 
The key question is ""how many of the things you do are within ~7 miles of your home?"".  With a battery range of ~15 miles, the Dualomo Hybrid-X will get you there and back with no problem.  Throw your charger in your backpack and you can also charge it on the move; like while grabbing a snack at your local coffee shop or in your friend Johnny's mom's kitchen.  She'll definitely think you're Johnny's coolest friend.
 
Does the Dualomo Hybrid come in different sizes?  Nope, this is one size fits all.  One of the reason's why Bustin Boards suggest that we use a modified version of their Sportster Board is due its accommodating size.  Although the full board comes in at a very stashable 35"", the wheelbase is long at almost 30"".  That means this a rather compact board that works great for ANY size rider.  Big feet?  Small feet?  No problem, the Dualomo Hybrid will perform great no matter what size you are.
In related news, the compact nature of the 35"" Dualomo Hybrid also makes it great for stashing under your desk at school or in the trunk of your car.  It also carries easily in a skateboard-strap-equipped backpack.
 
Is the Dualomo Hybrid waterproof?A better word would probably be water resistant.  If you ride it in the rain or want to spray it off with a hose, you will be fine.  If you accidentally launch it into the Hudson River and manage to retrieve it, you may need to replace the circuit board.  We salute you for jumping in after it and we'll help get you that new circuit board.
 
Is the battery removeable?We've designed our battery/circuitry cover to be easily removeable for any repairs or DIY upgrades people want to add (note that any DIY upgrades DO void the warranty, sorry tech nerds,  but you know thats normal :).  However, this board does not include a quick-swap battery design.  This would be a cool update on future versions, but our focus on this initial launch was on the PUSH/PUMP friendly elements.  IF you have any issues with your battery, we will most definitely be here to walk you through removing the casing and replacing it.
 
Can I ride the Dualomo Hybrid if the battery dies?Yes, yes and yes.  This is one of the coolest benefits of the Push-Friendly design.  No more will you be 'that guy' walking through the crowd because your riding lawnmower excuse for a skateboard died.
 
What kind of warranty do you offer on the Dualomo Hybrid?All boards come with a 1 year limited manufacturers warranty.  Should you encounter some production related manufacturer’s defect during this time, we will take care of it according to our warranty.  As some elements of a board can be damaged due to certain types of riding and or crashes and accidents, we reserve the right to examine each warranty claim individually.  In other words, if you experience problems with your battery we’ll gladly replace it and get you riding again fast and easy.  If you’re board gets run over by a cross-town bus, the best we can offer you is a 30% off replacement deal.   We're fair and approachable;  and we're committed to supporting all of you who are helping us get this product off the ground.

<div><h3>How Will This Robot Make A Change?</h3></div>
<p></p>

There are many applications for this project, because sometimes we need to drive a vehicle through tough terrains and rough environments therefore we cannot rely on UAVs all the time, we cannot also rely on traditional wheel vehicle all the time. That is why we decided to merge between these two technologies by designing a vehicle that can do both jobs and ride through almost everything.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1171243/files/20150124113006-Body5.jpg?1422127806"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>COPT-A-CAR In Flight Mode</p>
<p><span>By using certain sensors and image processing the COPT-A-CAR will be able to invade the following fields:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>- Security &amp; Surveillance</span></p>
<p>- Entertainment</p>
<p>- Photography</p>
<p>- Scientific Research</p>
<p>- Rescue Operations </p>
<p>- Construction</p>
<p>This kind of vehicle is handier than traditional robots, since it can carry a payload up to 2 kg, we can use it to bring orders from and to different places.</p>

<p>Also it got attention in the aviation field, since the flight simulators consultant Mr. Sami Al-Azzeh said:</p>

<h3>Why We Can't Do it Without you?</h3>
Scientific research is an expensive process, especially if you fund it by yourself without getting any support. Unfortunately, here in Jordan scientific research is not getting its fair share whether you were seeking financial or technical support. Around here if you have an amazing idea, mostly you will stop due to the financial burdens.<br/><br/>Our case is not very different, a while back we had to stop because we couldn't buy the parts and also couldn't pay the turnery since most of the mechanical parts are custom made. It was tough until we thought about presenting our idea on Indiegogo so we can finish the prototype and develop it in order to meet our design’s specifications.<br/><br/>200,000$ will sure be enough to complete and present to you a smart vehicle with capabilities you have never seen before. The 200,000$ will be divided into perks delivery, charity program and project pure fund. The pure fund will be put to action in recruiting a team of professional engineers in order to bring the bring the project to a higher level of perfection and alignment, also unfortunately some parts will not be available here in Jordan due to shipment and customs. The plan is to move our workplace to USA or China because its much easier for work and parts delivery not to mention the ability to construct a carbon fiber body and frame since the overall weight is a critical matter<br/><br/>In designing regular remote controlled cards we mostly focus on speed, range and battery durability. While in quad-copters we focus on aerodynamics, payload, flight time, environment, surrounding temperature, etc... Well that will be lots of variables to consider.<br/><br/>The weight has been a big challenge since we are doing lots of merging and mechanical mechanisms aside with electrical and embedded systems. We got over it by choosing a powerful battery along with super brushless motors with high powerendurability, but here we go back to the closed loop of finance. The merging itself is challenging so as the number of parts and how to get them in perfect alignment. The frame and the support mechanisms have to be done using CNC machines to reduce the possible human error, but in Jordan using CNC machines is not affordable at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Hybrid System Challenge - Car &amp; Flight Modes</h3>
<div>The COPT-A-CAR has three transfer functions and it transfers between three states, car mode, flight mode and transition mode, when one of them is on the other two are off to avoid overlapping.<p></p>
<p>The car mode allows the user to drive the vehicle just like a normal remote-controlled car which can go to all directions, but when the toggle switch is switched to the flight mode the vehicle will first raise from the ground the pushes the wheels in the vertical state to be ready for the flight mode. Each mode has its own mechanism and drivers with separate controllers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1173257/files/20150125141243-IMG_1146.JPG?1422223963"" src="""" style=""width: 361.33px; height: 271px;""/></p>
<div>The flight mode mechanism will be hidden as you are in the car mode, in fact that is the main idea of the project. In the prototype phase the transformed UAV will be able to carry a payload up to 1 kg additional to the 7 kgs vehicle weight. Easy to use but complex to build!<p></p>

</div><div>There is another way you can help us other than donating. If you are someone who can get us to a research laboratory or a company which can adopt this project and develop it, then you are more than welcome to contact us.<br/><br/>Of course you are free to share it on social media and we would be very thankful if you did.<br/><br/><br/>Will All the Funds Go to the Project?<h3> </h3>After reading ""Just Give Money to The Poor"" Book by Joseph Hanlon, Armando Barrientos and David Hulme, we thought about doing a campaign here in Jordan in which we choose homeless poor people and grant each one 500$ in order to give them a chance to change their lives. We will dedicate 2.5% of our raised funds for this manner. In London May 2009 a local charity took a decision of giving 3000 pounds to thirteen homeless men, no strings attached.<span><br/>After a year eleven from the thirteen had roofs on their heads (The Joseph Rowntree Foundation did this experiment).<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>That's why we thought seriously about changing a few lives and maybe build their future. Our success should move through community, we want this project to have roots in more than one aspect. Think about how many lives will be influenced by your contribution.</span><br/></p></span>

Eid majored in civil engineering while Ahmad and Mouath majored in mechatronics engineering. Since the early years they had interests in mechanics and embedded systems. When that ""interest"" got motivated by practical experiment and knowledge the project was born. Mouath has the whole idea figured out in sketches and worked on the driving mechanism while Ahmad points of expertise were electrical design and development. Eid is an expert when it comes to calculating mechanical properties needed for shafts, gears and all the mechanical parts. We are really proud to be working with each other in harmony and understanding. <br/><br/>

How Will This Robot Make A Change?


There are many applications for this project, because sometimes we need to drive a vehicle through tough terrains and rough environments therefore we cannot rely on UAVs all the time, we cannot also rely on traditional wheel vehicle all the time. That is why we decided to merge between these two technologies by designing a vehicle that can do both jobs and ride through almost everything.
COPT-A-CAR in Car Mode


COPT-A-CAR In Flight Mode
By using certain sensors and image processing the COPT-A-CAR will be able to invade the following fields:

- Security & Surveillance
- Entertainment
- Photography
- Scientific Research
- Rescue Operations 
- Construction
This kind of vehicle is handier than traditional robots, since it can carry a payload up to 2 kg, we can use it to bring orders from and to different places.

Experts' Point of View

The project got attention by the head of Mechatronics Engineering Department Dr. Mohammad Al Janaideh who was named in Elsevier Journal as the author of the second most cited mechatronics article.


Also it got attention in the aviation field, since the flight simulators consultant Mr. Sami Al-Azzeh said:

""I would like to express my most heartfelt gratitude and admiration to you for the impressive innovation of the COPT-A-CAR and the hard work exerted to achieve this project. The invention that you are conveying has proved to be a massive draw for people by making use of technology. Everyone appreciates the way that are conducting yourself is a credit to you and enthusiastic engineers like you. I wish you all success through your study and practice life""



Why We Can't Do it Without you?
Scientific research is an expensive process, especially if you fund it by yourself without getting any support. Unfortunately, here in Jordan scientific research is not getting its fair share whether you were seeking financial or technical support. Around here if you have an amazing idea, mostly you will stop due to the financial burdens.Our case is not very different, a while back we had to stop because we couldn't buy the parts and also couldn't pay the turnery since most of the mechanical parts are custom made. It was tough until we thought about presenting our idea on Indiegogo so we can finish the prototype and develop it in order to meet our design’s specifications.200,000$ will sure be enough to complete and present to you a smart vehicle with capabilities you have never seen before. The 200,000$ will be divided into perks delivery, charity program and project pure fund. The pure fund will be put to action in recruiting a team of professional engineers in order to bring the bring the project to a higher level of perfection and alignment, also unfortunately some parts will not be available here in Jordan due to shipment and customs. The plan is to move our workplace to USA or China because its much easier for work and parts delivery not to mention the ability to construct a carbon fiber body and frame since the overall weight is a critical matterIn designing regular remote controlled cards we mostly focus on speed, range and battery durability. While in quad-copters we focus on aerodynamics, payload, flight time, environment, surrounding temperature, etc... Well that will be lots of variables to consider.The weight has been a big challenge since we are doing lots of merging and mechanical mechanisms aside with electrical and embedded systems. We got over it by choosing a powerful battery along with super brushless motors with high powerendurability, but here we go back to the closed loop of finance. The merging itself is challenging so as the number of parts and how to get them in perfect alignment. The frame and the support mechanisms have to be done using CNC machines to reduce the possible human error, but in Jordan using CNC machines is not affordable at all.

The Hybrid System Challenge - Car & Flight Modes
The COPT-A-CAR has three transfer functions and it transfers between three states, car mode, flight mode and transition mode, when one of them is on the other two are off to avoid overlapping.
The car mode allows the user to drive the vehicle just like a normal remote-controlled car which can go to all directions, but when the toggle switch is switched to the flight mode the vehicle will first raise from the ground the pushes the wheels in the vertical state to be ready for the flight mode. Each mode has its own mechanism and drivers with separate controllers.



The flight mode mechanism will be hidden as you are in the car mode, in fact that is the main idea of the project. In the prototype phase the transformed UAV will be able to carry a payload up to 1 kg additional to the 7 kgs vehicle weight. Easy to use but complex to build!




Other Ways You Can Help

There is another way you can help us other than donating. If you are someone who can get us to a research laboratory or a company which can adopt this project and develop it, then you are more than welcome to contact us.Of course you are free to share it on social media and we would be very thankful if you did.Will All the Funds Go to the Project? After reading ""Just Give Money to The Poor"" Book by Joseph Hanlon, Armando Barrientos and David Hulme, we thought about doing a campaign here in Jordan in which we choose homeless poor people and grant each one 500$ in order to give them a chance to change their lives. We will dedicate 2.5% of our raised funds for this manner. In London May 2009 a local charity took a decision of giving 3000 pounds to thirteen homeless men, no strings attached.After a year eleven from the thirteen had roofs on their heads (The Joseph Rowntree Foundation did this experiment).
That's why we thought seriously about changing a few lives and maybe build their future. Our success should move through community, we want this project to have roots in more than one aspect. Think about how many lives will be influenced by your contribution.


About the Founders
Mouath, Ahmad and Eid have been friends for over 7 years, went to the same school and the same university (The University of Jordan). Eid majored in civil engineering while Ahmad and Mouath majored in mechatronics engineering. Since the early years they had interests in mechanics and embedded systems. When that ""interest"" got motivated by practical experiment and knowledge the project was born. Mouath has the whole idea figured out in sketches and worked on the driving mechanism while Ahmad points of expertise were electrical design and development. Eid is an expert when it comes to calculating mechanical properties needed for shafts, gears and all the mechanical parts. We are really proud to be working with each other in harmony and understanding.

We'll find a smaller option, like a Camper, to make our dream come true!)--------------------------------------------------------------------Plus, depending on how much you can help us with, you will receive different personalize updates of our trip! Check out this portion of the page to know the specifications.Give us the opportunity to  help others, live the biggest adventure of our life, share love and be truly free.Don't forget to follow our facebook page called : Trust Happiness Bus Tour!----------------------------------------------------------------------Bonjour! Nous sommes deux étudiants du CEGEP, l’école pré-universitaire, de Montréal. Noémie étudie présentement les arts visuels et j’étudie (Bastien) les mathématiques, le cinéma et la gestion. (Ce n’est pas d’où tu viens qui compte, mais où tu vas haha!) Nous avons déjà fait deux voyages ensemble qui ont changé notre vie à jamais. Nous avons commencé par visiter le Mexique et la Californie, puis nous avons fait un grand tour de l’Europe de l’Ouest! Maintenant, nous sommes acceptés à l’Université, mais nous avons l’impression que nous devons d’abord satisfaire notre infatigable désir d’aventure. Nous nous demandions donc, comment joindre notre passion du voyage, notre besoin d’apprendre et notre avidité de changer le monde?----------------------------------------------------------------------Voilà le plan!On veut acheter un vieil autobus, le transformer en un VR moderne, écologique et, surtout, heureux. Avec ce nouveau véhicule, nous traverserons les Amérique pour aider les gens dans leur communauté. Nous commencerons à Montréal, conduirons jusqu’en Floride, continuerons au Texas, en Louisiane, et en Amérique Centrale, ferons un saut en Amérique du Sud, retournerons sur la côte ouest américaine, conduirons jusqu’en Alaska et reviendrons à la maison.-------------------------------------------------------------------Nous utiliserons deux sites très intéressants pour réaliser notre projet : workaway.org et couchsurfing.com. Avec Workaway, nous irons donner un coup de main à des communautés partout à travers le Nouveau Monde, afin, par exemple, d’aider des familles à apprendre l’anglais ou le français, de travailler sur des fermes organiques, dans des organisations à but non lucratif dans des régions plus défavorisés ou dans des organisations qui préservent la faune et la flore.--------------------------------------------------------------------Voici notre budget : 3500$ sur le vieil autobus,4000$ sur la mécanique : réparer les freins, la suspension, ajuster le moteur et la transmission,3000$ sur la rénovation intérieure : cuisine, panneaux solaires, lits, espaces de rangement, travaux électriques et plomberie,Pour un grand total de 10 500$ ! (Si on n’atteint pas notre objectif, ne vous inquiétez pas, nous trouverons une option plus petite, comme un campeur, pour réaliser notre rêve!)--------------------------------------------------------------------De plus, dépendant d’à quel point vous pouvez nous aider, vous recevrez différentes mises à jours de notre voyage! Regardez la partie de la page qui y est destiné pour plus d’informations! Donnez nous l’opportunité d’aider les autres, de vivre la plus grande aventure de notre vie, de partager de l’amour et d’être complètement libres! N’oubliez pas de suivre notre page Facebook nommée : Trust Happiness Bus Tour!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Speedway Motorcycle Racing is one of the most exciting and oldest motor sports in the world.<br/>4 riders race clockwise for 4 rounds on an oval sand track up to 400m always in drift, without brakes, with an acceleration faster than a Formula 1 racing car.</p>

<p>Speedway
motorcycles are extremely loud and very expensive to maintain, as
usual in fuel-powered motorsports.</p>
<p>
The cool roaring of the engines
and the smell of burned oil has taken every motor sports fan`s breath away and attracted people for generations.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>But That is also a huge problem. </b></span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
<b>Racetracks
all over the world can only be used with special permits, due to
noise pollution of the residents.</b></p>
<p>
Training
on racetracks is therefore only
partially possible 1-2 times a year. Also t<span><b>he
costs of engine repairs per 100 laps @ 400 meters add up to $550-700</b><b>.
</b><b>This
makes the </b><b>sport almost unaffordable for average entthusiasts, newcomers and young
people</b>.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>NOW - HERE IS THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436780394/khm1kvodddrgjaed3p4c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>By
introducing our nearly noiseless electric speedway bikes,
racetracks can now be used 24
hours a, every day of the week, for training and competition. </p>
<p>
This is impossible with fuel-powered machines because of their noise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
For
motorsport fans, who can't imagine silent motorcycle racing, we have a special option - a sound module and high-pressure
loudspeaker with original the tone of a 500cc speedway machine -
coming soon!</p>
<p><b>This can be used as special equipment </b><b>with races in which </b><b>there are no problems with noise.</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Another
big advantage of the new technology is the 98% decrease
of the operation costs for engine maintenance and fuel compared to
methanol speedway motorcycles</span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</b><br/></p>
<p>Calculation: A speedway rider,
who rides roughly 8 hours per month, saves</p>
<h3>
up to 3500 dollars each month!</h3>
<p>
This huge cost advantage makes
this sport affordable for every young person and comparable to other popular sports.<br/>Thus the training for the new generations of riders is
cost-efficiently possible.</p></span>

Since the Electric Speedway machines are almost maintenance-free and will have lower maintenance costs, we have the opportunity to provide  them to clubs and training camps. <br/>
Together with these clubs and our fans we can then promote training days and invite teenagers and newcomers to try them out.<br/>
This enables us to create new long-term fans and electric Speedway riders to preserve and grow the sport.<br/>More information for newcomers, riders, and teams can be found on our website.</span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""></div><div style=""text-align: center;""></div><div style=""text-align: center;""></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

Many people have immense knowledge and skills, but they do not use it. Using Indiegogo to implement the knowledge and  moving things further hand in hand, that's the most important factor of a successful idea before it disappears forever into the drawer.<br/>
The fact is the only truth.</p>

Now I am working for over 3 years very intensively with the E-bikes. </p>
<p>
In
the meantime I
have  tested a lot and I gave
a lot of  input to the development. The reason is for my
strong commitment
is the fact, that
I see a<br/>realistic chance to
revive
our sport, especially at youth level.Training
with
the          e-bikes is
big fun and you can bomb down the racetracks as long as you like
without cleaning and maintaining the engine for hours afterwards.
Especially kids will love it. They can perform the world coolest
sport and still have enough time and money for school and other
activities.</p>

I'm really enthusiastic about the work of the electric speedway machines. </p>
<p>
We have noise
pollution measurement problems all
over the world and especially here in Germany at
speedway
racetracks and long paths. Surely
a new thinking in all motor sport heads must be established. I am
happy to work together with the Elektro Sport Bund, where we will
start some cool projects for the future.</p>

<p><b>Dominic Wirz</b><br/><b>CAD</b></p>
<p>An ingenious project - the development of the world's first electro speedway bikes as a step into the future. An unique motorcycle was created with state of the art technology. The fully computer-aided design (CAD) allowed the<br/>complete planning and execution of the construction, even statements about deformation and stability have been simulated during development.</p>
<p>Therefore the drivers input concerning their requirements was easily implemented already in develompent state of constructing a complete motor cycle.</p>
<p>Using heavy duty steel made a low weight possible by<br/>reducing the wall thicknesses which simultanously enabled safe and robust<br/>framework with good driving dynamics. Out of nowhere came the first<br/>prototype. Yesterday in the computer only, today on the racetrack!</p>
<p>Even as a once convinced combustion motorcyclist, my first ride deeply impressed me. The performance and driving feeling, just with an electric motor - unbelievable!</p>
<p>Electric is the future, who defends oneself against it, will miss the best!</p>

<p>Fans experience the pure power of the driver, without being distracted by noise.<br/>The drivers can train at any time and as long as they want to, while neighbors held their after-lungch nap and drink their coffee - undisturbed.<br/>Here technological progress proves its usefulness in the experience of pleasure.</p>

<p>Die Entwicklung des weltweit ersten Elektor-Speedway-Bikes als Schritt in die Zukunft – ein geniales Projekt. Mit mondernster Technik wurde  ein einzigartiges Motorrad geschaffen. Die komplett computergestützte Konstruktion (CAD) ermöglichte die komplette Planung und Durchführung der Konstruktion, selbst Aussagen über Verformung und Stabilität konnten während der Entwicklung über numerische Simulationen berücksichtigt werden.  Das Ermöglichte bereits im Entwicklungsstadium Wünsche der Fahrer einzubringen, Anforderungen zu berücksichtigen und ein komplettes Motorrad zu entwerfen. Hochleistungsstahl ermöglichte einerseits ein geringes Gewicht durch reduzierte Wandstärken zu realisieren und andererseits einen sicheren und robusten Rahmen mit guter Fahrdynamik zu entwickeln.  Wie aus dem nichts entstand so der erste Prototyp, gestern noch im Rechner heute schon auf der Bahn! Einst selbst überzeugter Verbrennungs-Motorradfahrer, war ich bei  der ersten Ausfahrt wie hingerissen. Die Leistung und das Fahrgefühl, das so ein Elektromotor bringt finde ich unglaublich. </p>

<div><b>Wie lange kann ich im Vergleich zur herkömmlichen Speedwaymaschine mit einer Akkuladung fahren?</b></div>
<div>Eine Tankfüllung bei einer normalen Speedwaymaschine beträgt 2,5 Liter und reicht für einen Heat (1 Lauf, 4 Runden) also insgesamt knapp 6 Runden á 400m. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mit dem Electric-Speedwaybike kannst Du mindestens 3-4 Heats fahren. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Je nach Fahrweise sind das 16-20 Runden á 400m.</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Wie lange dauert es bis der Akku wieder aufgeladen ist?</b></div>
<div>Die Ladezeit beträgt ca. 3,5 Stunden. Wir könnten mit einem Schnellladegerät auch in etwa einer Stunde laden, das ist aber nicht notwendig, weil wir den Akku innerhalb von 30 Sekunden austauschen können. So können wir den Akku schonend laden und erreichen eine höhere Lebensdauer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Wieviel Kraftstoffeinsparung, kann man mit der Electric-Speedway-Maschine erreichen?</b></div>
<div>Um z.B. 30-40 Runden zu fahren, würdest Du ca. 6x volltanken mit 2,5 Liter Methanol = 12,5 Liter x 1,80 Euro = 27 Euro. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Um die gleich Rundenzahl zu erreichen müsstest Du Deinen Akku 2x volladen und die  Kosten würden nur ca. 0.40 cent betragen. Wenn das alleine schon kein Argument ist!</span>
</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Wie oft kann ich den Akku laden und was kostet das insgesamt?</b></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Unser Akku hat einen Ladezyklus von ca. 1000 Ladungen. Das wären in Kilometer umgerechnet ca. 8000 Kilometer auf der Speedwaybahn. Die gesamten Stromkosten belaufen sich auf nur ca. 200 Euro. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Die Kosten für die gleiche Distanz mit Methanol liegen bei etwa 13.500 Euro.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Deine Ersparnis liegt bei ca. 13.300 Euro. </b></span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Wie lange hält der Elektro-Motor und wie sind die Wartungsintervalle?</b></div>
<div>Unsere Motortechnologie ist wartungsfrei und hat keine Kohlebürsten wie normale Elektromotoren, die ausgetauscht werden müssen. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wir geben eine Garantie von 10.000 Betriebsstunden, das heißt du kannst mit einem Motor praktisch 1 Mio Kilometer mit 100km/h fahren.</span>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Der bürstenlose Elektromotor ist wartungsfrei, wieviel Kosten kann ich hier einsparen?</b></p>

THE WORLD'S FIRST

- ZERO EMISSION ELECTRIC-SPEEDWAY BIKE -

 SAFE 98% OF TRADITIONAL OPERATING COSTS


Speedway Motorcycle Racing is one of the most exciting and oldest motor sports in the world.4 riders race clockwise for 4 rounds on an oval sand track up to 400m always in drift, without brakes, with an acceleration faster than a Formula 1 racing car.




Robert Lambert, Martin Smolinski




Speedway
motorcycles are extremely loud and very expensive to maintain, as
usual in fuel-powered motorsports.

The cool roaring of the engines
and the smell of burned oil has taken every motor sports fan`s breath away and attracted people for generations.
But That is also a huge problem. 


Racetracks
all over the world can only be used with special permits, due to
noise pollution of the residents.

Training
on racetracks is therefore only
partially possible 1-2 times a year. Also the
costs of engine repairs per 100 laps @ 400 meters add up to $550-700.
This
makes the sport almost unaffordable for average entthusiasts, newcomers and young
people.


NOW - HERE IS THE SOLUTION

By
introducing our nearly noiseless electric speedway bikes,
racetracks can now be used 24
hours a, every day of the week, for training and competition. 

This is impossible with fuel-powered machines because of their noise.



For
motorsport fans, who can't imagine silent motorcycle racing, we have a special option - a sound module and high-pressure
loudspeaker with original the tone of a 500cc speedway machine -
coming soon!
This can be used as special equipment with races in which there are no problems with noise.
Another
big advantage of the new technology is the 98% decrease
of the operation costs for engine maintenance and fuel compared to
methanol speedway motorcycles.
Calculation: A speedway rider,
who rides roughly 8 hours per month, saves

up to 3500 dollars each month!

This huge cost advantage makes
this sport affordable for every young person and comparable to other popular sports.Thus the training for the new generations of riders is
cost-efficiently possible.

 Martin Smolinski, German Speedway Star

ENDURANCE TESTING IN THE POURING RAIN


Our electric speedway machines are tested under the hardest weather conditions. On the training course in Peterborough / England, Martin Smolinski (speedway professional) drove 12 laps in the pouring rain without issues. A normal speedway machine would have died after the first big puddle.


Another advantage of our closed drive system: simply spray it off and go!

Since the Electric Speedway machines are almost maintenance-free and will have lower maintenance costs, we have the opportunity to provide  them to clubs and training camps. 
Together with these clubs and our fans we can then promote training days and invite teenagers and newcomers to try them out.
This enables us to create new long-term fans and electric Speedway riders to preserve and grow the sport.More information for newcomers, riders, and teams can be found on our website.

Many people have immense knowledge and skills, but they do not use it. Using Indiegogo to implement the knowledge and  moving things further hand in hand, that's the most important factor of a successful idea before it disappears forever into the drawer.
The fact is the only truth.


Chris Vrzak

Since I first heard of the electric-powered prototype, the incredible thrill of acceleration tied up!
Today I say, try and do not complain, because who tried the e-Speedway machine  is just captivated!
Feel it and love it

The development of the electric speedway machine is a small step for each driver and a great step for the motorsports.
Electric is the future


Martin Smolinski
www.SR-Speedperformance.com

Now I am working for over 3 years very intensively with the E-bikes. 

In
the meantime I
have  tested a lot and I gave
a lot of  input to the development. The reason is for my
strong commitment
is the fact, that
I see arealistic chance to
revive
our sport, especially at youth level.Training
with
the          e-bikes is
big fun and you can bomb down the racetracks as long as you like
without cleaning and maintaining the engine for hours afterwards.
Especially kids will love it. They can perform the world coolest
sport and still have enough time and money for school and other
activities.



René Schäfer
DMV Vice President

I'm really enthusiastic about the work of the electric speedway machines. 

We have noise
pollution measurement problems all
over the world and especially here in Germany at
speedway
racetracks and long paths. Surely
a new thinking in all motor sport heads must be established. I am
happy to work together with the Elektro Sport Bund, where we will
start some cool projects for the future.


Dushan Gardlo
Executive Technology

The powertrain is th centerpiece of our development. It is universially applicable in a variety of motorcycle models and small commercial vehicles.The same battery, controller and the same type of motor engine can be used for different applications. 
These requirements have been necessary to maintain sustainable low to the development costs for other electric vehicles.




Dominic WirzCAD
An ingenious project - the development of the world's first electro speedway bikes as a step into the future. An unique motorcycle was created with state of the art technology. The fully computer-aided design (CAD) allowed thecomplete planning and execution of the construction, even statements about deformation and stability have been simulated during development.
Therefore the drivers input concerning their requirements was easily implemented already in develompent state of constructing a complete motor cycle.
Using heavy duty steel made a low weight possible byreducing the wall thicknesses which simultanously enabled safe and robustframework with good driving dynamics. Out of nowhere came the firstprototype. Yesterday in the computer only, today on the racetrack!
Even as a once convinced combustion motorcyclist, my first ride deeply impressed me. The performance and driving feeling, just with an electric motor - unbelievable!
Electric is the future, who defends oneself against it, will miss the best!




Slavisa Radovic
Development and production of electrical motor drives

10,000 hours guaranteed maintenance-free service life time of our brushless synchronous electric motor with disc-shaped rotor, speak for themselves.Electromobility is the future - fuel-powered engines are stone age.


Hermann Poppinga
Mentor

To have fun and to give pleasure to someone else is the most rewarding thing in life - especially when it doesn't disturb others. This is particularly true for speedway races with almost noiseless and  emission-free electric motorcycles:
Fans experience the pure power of the driver, without being distracted by noise.The drivers can train at any time and as long as they want to, while neighbors held their after-lungch nap and drink their coffee - undisturbed.Here technological progress proves its usefulness in the experience of pleasure.

DAS WELTWEIT ERSTE
- ZERO EMISSION ELECTRIC-SPEEDWAY BIKE -
SPARE 98% DER BETRIEBSKOSTEN



Speedway Motorradsport ist eine der spannendsten und ältesten Motorsportarten der Welt. 

Gefahren wird mit 4 Fahrern auf ovalen Sandbahnen bis 400m im Uhrzeigersinn, immer im Drift, ohne Bremsen, 4 Runden, mit einer Beschleunigung schneller als ein Formel-1-Rennwagen.




Robert Lambert, Martin Smolinski









Wie es bei jedem Motorsport üblich ist, sind die kraftstoffbetriebenen Speedwaymotorräder extrem laut und im Unterhalt sehr teuer.
Das geile Dröhnen der Motoren und der Geruch von verbranntem Öl lässt jedem Fan den Atem stocken und fesselt seit Generationen viele Menschen an den Sport. 
Und genau das ist, aber auch ein riesiges Problem
Überall auf der Welt können Rennbahnen,
wegen Lärmbelästigung der Anwohner zum Großteil nur noch mit Sondergenehmigungen befahren werden!


 
Das Training auf den Rennstrecken ist so teilweise nur 1-2 mal im Jahr möglich.Die Kosten für die Motorinstandsetzung pro 100 Runden x 400m liegen zwischen 500€ und 700€ und machen diese Motorsportart für Normalverdiener, Neueinsteiger und Jugendliche fast unerschwinglich.




HIERFÜR GIBT ES JETZT DIE LÖSUNG




Durch die Einführung von unseren fast geräuschlosen Electric-Speedwaybikes können wir die Rennstrecken 24 Stunden, jeden Tag in der Woche, wieder für Training und Wettkampf nutzen.  Dies ist mit den kraftstoffbetriebenen Maschinen wegen der Lautstärke nicht möglich.
Für die Motorsportfans, denen nun der Gedanke an ein geräuschloses Motorradrennen, die Fußnägel aufrollt, sei an dieser Stelle gesagt, an ein Geräuschmodul und Hochdrucklautsprecher mit Originalton einer 500ccm Speedwaymaschine haben wir natürlich gedacht. Dies kann bei Rennen als Sonderausstattung zum Einsatz kommen, bei denen es wegen der Lautstärke keine Probleme gibt.

Ein weiterer großer Vorteil der neuen Technologie ist die Betriebskostensenkung um 98% für Motorwartung und Kraftstoff im Vergleich zum Verbrenner-Speedwaymotorrad.


Das bedeutet für einen Speedwayfahrer, der im Monat ca. 8 Stunden fährt, 


bis zu 3000 Euro Ersparnis - jeden Monat.


Mit diesem riesigen Kostenvorteil, könnte diese Trendsportart für jeden Jugendlichen, so günstig wie viele andere Breitensportarten sein. 


Das Training für den Nachwuchs würde damit kostengünstig realisierbar werden.

"" Ein prägendes Erlebnis in frühster Jugend ""
- Manuel Eliseo -

Als ich 5 Jahre alt war, sah ich mit meinem Vater, das erste Mal in meinem Leben ein Speedwayrennen live in Norddeutschland. Ich weiß noch, als wäre es gestern gewesen, wie mir der Dreck um die Ohren flog und mein ganzer Körper durch den Sound der Maschinen vibrierte. 
Ich war wie gefesselt
Diese faszinierenden Eindrücke haben mich nie wieder losgelassen.
Ich bekomme heute noch Gänsehaut, wenn ich ein Speedway-Rennen nur auf Video sehe. 
In den folgenden Jahrzehnten habe ich  nie wieder  von Sandbahnrennen gehört oder gesehen.

Über 35 Jahre später durfte ich durch Zufall (Zufälle gibt es nicht) den bekanntesten deutschen Motorradsportler und Speedway-Weltmeister,                Egon Müller kennen lernen.
Er lud mich einen Tag später zu einem Sandbahnrennen ein, welches er als Co-Moderator moderierte.Als ich die ersten Rennen sah und im Fahrerlager die Stars hautnah erleben durfte, wie sie ihre Maschinen abstimmten und reparierten, konnte ich mich mit ein paar Fahrern austauschen und erstmals hinter die Kulissen des Speedway Rennzirkus schauen. 
Alle Fahrer erzählten von den gleichen Problemen. 
Zu wenig Trainingsmöglichkeiten, schlechte Bezahlung, zu hohe Kosten, kein Nachwuchs, kein großes Medieninteresse, zu wenig Sponsoren und immer weniger Zuschauer.
Ich erkannte schnell, daß die Lösung für all diese Probleme eine Speedwaymaschine mit Elektromotor sein könnte.
Diese Idee allerdings alleine umzusetzen? - nahezu unmöglich!
Dabei hatte ich doch eigentlich die besten Vorraussetzungen dieses Projekt zu verwirklichen.
Ich ""kannte"" doch Egon Müller, den einzigen deutschen Speedway Weltmeister, der zudem für unzählige andere Weltmeister, Europameister und Topfahrer deren Motoren tunete.
Ich kannte Egon zwar erst ""2 Tage"", aber das war mir egal, die Chemie stimmte.
Als ich ihm von meiner Idee erzählte, war Egon sofort Feuer und Flamme. Ihm fiel fast seine Dose Erbsensuppe aus der Hand, die er sich im Fahrerlager erhitzt hatte.
 Die Befürchtung, dass es zuviel Geld kosten würde so eine Maschine zu entwickeln, war sein einziger Einwand.
Dieser konnte mich aber nicht davon abhalten das Projekt auch unter schwierigen Umständen zu starten. 
Heute sage ich: ""Gott sei Dank"".
Aus unserer Bekanntschaft wurde während der Entwicklungszeit bis zum heutigen Tag, eine enge Freundschaft.
Das war die Geburtsstunde für das erste Electric Speedway Bike und der Auslöser, dass sich seither alles in meinem Leben um den Sport und die Weiterentwicklung der Electric-Speedway Bikes dreht.
Mit Egon Müller, konnten wir die Erfahrungen aus 50 Jahren Motorsport und Tuning in unser Projekt einfliessen lassen.
Unser Maßstab war, eine Electric-Speedwaymaschine zu konstruieren, die für den täglichen Einsatz gedacht ist. Fast wartungsfrei und nach dem neuesten Stand der Technik und der Produktionsmöglichkeiten in Serie zu fertigen. 
Nach fast 4 Jahren Entwicklungszeit und über 10.000 Test-Kilometern konnten wir nun unsere Visionen umsetzen, die günstigste und wirtschaftlichste Electric-Speedway-Rennmaschine für Training und Wettbewerb serientauglich fertig zu stellen. Um damit eine neue Generation im Speedwaysport einzuläuten und mit dieser Innovation den Motorsport zu revolutionieren.
Wir hoffen mit eurer Unterstützung in den nächsten Monaten das weltweit erste Trainingscamp mit Electric-Speedway Bikes zu veranstalten und bald die ersten Rennen in einer reinen Electric-Speedwayklasse auszurichten.
Sollte uns dies gelingen, wäre die erste Electric Speedway Weltmeisterschaft nicht mehr weit.
Wir freuen uns mit allen Unterstützern und Fans, die wir weltweit mit unserem Projekt begeistern können, in eine aufregende und energiegeladene Zukunft zu starten.
Ich wünsche Euch immer volle Akkus
Euer

Ich beschäftige mich nun seit über 3 Jahren sehr intensiv mit den E-Bikes, habe zwischenzeitlich viel getestet und einiges an Input geleistet, um die Entwicklung voranzutreiben. 


Der Grund für mein ausgeprägtes Engagement ist, dass ich hier eine realistische Chance sehe unseren Sport, vor allem im Nachwuchsbereich, wieder massiv zu beleben.


Es macht auch mit den E-Bikes richtig Laune zu trainieren, du kannst ewig nach Belieben heizen, ohne im Anschluß den Motor wieder stundenlang reinigen und warten zu müssen. So etwas kommt den Kids sicher auch sehr entgegen, denn man kann den geilsten Sport der Welt ausüben und trotzdem bleibt noch genug Zeit und Geld für die Schule und andere Aktivitäten übrig.




René Schäfer
Elektro Sportchef & DMV Vize Präsident

Ich bin wirklich begeistert von der Arbeit der Electric-Speedway Maschinen. Wir haben überall in der Welt und besonders bei uns in Deutschland Probleme mit den Lärmmessungen für Speedway- und Langbahnen. Hier muss sicher in allen Köpfen des Motorsportes ein Umdenken beginnen. Ich freue mich auf die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Elektro Sport Bund und bin mir sicher, dass wir einige tolle Projekte für die Zukunft auf den Weg bringen können.





Dominic Wirz
CAD- Konstruktionsleiter
Die Entwicklung des weltweit ersten Elektor-Speedway-Bikes als Schritt in die Zukunft – ein geniales Projekt. Mit mondernster Technik wurde  ein einzigartiges Motorrad geschaffen. Die komplett computergestützte Konstruktion (CAD) ermöglichte die komplette Planung und Durchführung der Konstruktion, selbst Aussagen über Verformung und Stabilität konnten während der Entwicklung über numerische Simulationen berücksichtigt werden.  Das Ermöglichte bereits im Entwicklungsstadium Wünsche der Fahrer einzubringen, Anforderungen zu berücksichtigen und ein komplettes Motorrad zu entwerfen. Hochleistungsstahl ermöglichte einerseits ein geringes Gewicht durch reduzierte Wandstärken zu realisieren und andererseits einen sicheren und robusten Rahmen mit guter Fahrdynamik zu entwickeln.  Wie aus dem nichts entstand so der erste Prototyp, gestern noch im Rechner heute schon auf der Bahn! Einst selbst überzeugter Verbrennungs-Motorradfahrer, war ich bei  der ersten Ausfahrt wie hingerissen. Die Leistung und das Fahrgefühl, das so ein Elektromotor bringt finde ich unglaublich. 
Elektro wird die Zukunft, wer sich dagegen wehrt verpasst das Beste!





Dushan Gardlo
Elektro Sport Bund Vorstand Technologie
Ein weiterer großer Vorteil des Herzstückes unserer Entwicklung- dem Antriebstrang, ist die universelle Einsatzmöglichkeit in den verschiedensten Motorradmodellen und Klein-Nutzfahrzeugen. 
Der gleiche Akku, die Steuerung und der gleiche Motorentyp für die verschiedensten Anwendung. Diese Maßgabe war erforderlich um die Entwicklungskosten für weitere Fahrzeuge nachhaltig gering zu halten.

Vergnügen zu erleben und anderen Vergnügen zu bereiten, gehört zu den schönsten und lohnendsten Dingen im Leben – vor allem dann, wenn wieder andere nicht dadurch gestört werden. Dies gilt besonders auch für Speedway-Rennen mit fast geräuschlosen und abgasfreien Elektro-Motorrädern: 
Die Fans erleben die pure Leistung der Fahrer, ohne von Motorengeknatter abgelenkt zu werden. 
Die Fahrer können jederzeit und solange wie sie wollen trainieren und die Leute in der Umgebung können in Ruhe ihr Mittagsschläfchen halten und ihren Kaffee trinken. 
Hier beweist technischer Fortschritt seinen Nutzen beim Erleben von Vergnügen.

Wie lange kann ich im Vergleich zur herkömmlichen Speedwaymaschine mit einer Akkuladung fahren?
Eine Tankfüllung bei einer normalen Speedwaymaschine beträgt 2,5 Liter und reicht für einen Heat (1 Lauf, 4 Runden) also insgesamt knapp 6 Runden á 400m. Mit dem Electric-Speedwaybike kannst Du mindestens 3-4 Heats fahren. Je nach Fahrweise sind das 16-20 Runden á 400m.


Wie lange dauert es bis der Akku wieder aufgeladen ist?
Die Ladezeit beträgt ca. 3,5 Stunden. Wir könnten mit einem Schnellladegerät auch in etwa einer Stunde laden, das ist aber nicht notwendig, weil wir den Akku innerhalb von 30 Sekunden austauschen können. So können wir den Akku schonend laden und erreichen eine höhere Lebensdauer.

Wieviel Kraftstoffeinsparung, kann man mit der Electric-Speedway-Maschine erreichen?
Um z.B. 30-40 Runden zu fahren, würdest Du ca. 6x volltanken mit 2,5 Liter Methanol = 12,5 Liter x 1,80 Euro = 27 Euro. Um die gleich Rundenzahl zu erreichen müsstest Du Deinen Akku 2x volladen und die  Kosten würden nur ca. 0.40 cent betragen. Wenn das alleine schon kein Argument ist!


Wie oft kann ich den Akku laden und was kostet das insgesamt?
Unser Akku hat einen Ladezyklus von ca. 1000 Ladungen. Das wären in Kilometer umgerechnet ca. 8000 Kilometer auf der Speedwaybahn. Die gesamten Stromkosten belaufen sich auf nur ca. 200 Euro. 
Die Kosten für die gleiche Distanz mit Methanol liegen bei etwa 13.500 Euro.
Deine Ersparnis liegt bei ca. 13.300 Euro. 

Wie lange hält der Elektro-Motor und wie sind die Wartungsintervalle?
Unsere Motortechnologie ist wartungsfrei und hat keine Kohlebürsten wie normale Elektromotoren, die ausgetauscht werden müssen. Wir geben eine Garantie von 10.000 Betriebsstunden, das heißt du kannst mit einem Motor praktisch 1 Mio Kilometer mit 100km/h fahren.


Der bürstenlose Elektromotor ist wartungsfrei, wieviel Kosten kann ich hier einsparen?
Die Motorinstandsetzung bei den Methanol Motoren beträgt nach ca. 2-3 Trainings-oder Renntagen, mit insgesamt 35 Rennen á 4 Runden, für Kolbenringe, Pleuellager, Dichtringen und Ventilfedern  500-700 Euro. Die Kupplungslamellen liegen bei 50-70 Euro pro Trainingstag. Hinzu kommt dann noch die Zeit für Ein- und Ausbau des Motors und der Kupplung plus Versandkosten für das ca. 30 Kilo schwere Antriebsaggregat.Wenn Du z.B jedes Wochenende in der Saison ein Trainingtag und ein Rennen fährst sparst Du gut und gerne 4000 Euro im Monat. Das heißt du hast innerhalb von 2,5 Monaten Dein Electric-Speedway Motorrad bezahlt.

Wie ist das Fahrverhalten im Vergleich zu einer normalen Speedwaymaschine?
Für Speedwayprofis ist das Fahren auf einer Electric-Speedwaymaschine ungewohnt, weil die Cracks jahrelang auf den gleichen Maschinen gefahren sind. Das liegt aber daran, daß das lautlose Beschleunigen sehr beeindruckend ist und im ersten Moment keiner weis, wo die Kraft herkommt. Aber nach den ersten Runden sieht es bei allen so aus als wären sie nie ein anderes Motorrad gefahren.

Kann ein blutiger Anfänger ein Electric-Speedwaybike überhaupt fahren?
Eine gute Voraussetzung wäre, daß Du schon Motorrad fahren kannst. Wir haben die Erfahrung gemacht das z.B. ganz junge Fahrer ab 10 Jahren sich viel schneller eingewöhnen können als ältere Fahrer.

Haben Die Electric-Speedway-Maschine keine Gangschaltung ?
Die Electric-Speedwaybikes benötigen keine Gänge und Kupplung. Unsere Elektromotoren entfalten die größte Kraft bei 300 Upm. Das bedeutet die Kosten für die Kupplung fällt komplett weg. Und du kannst Dich voll auf das Fahren konzentrieren. 

Kann jeder, egal wie groß und schwer er ist, mit der selben Maschine fahren?
Ja, wir haben unsere Electric-Speedway so konzipiert, daß wir die Sitzhöhe in 7 Positionen verstellen können, damit erreicht jeder Fahrer seine optimal Sitzposition.

Gibt es unterschiedliche Motorenleistung bei den Electric-Speedwaybikes?
In der ersten Version bis 30 PS haben wir 2 Stufen, 100% und 50% Leistung. Somit kann ein Anfänger in der kleinen Fahrstufe erstmal vorsichtig üben.

Was kann ein Verein einsparen bzw. Erwirtschaften, wenn er Electric-Speedwaymotorräder in der Vermietung einsetzt.
Wie du oben bereits gelesen hast, kann ein Fahrer pro Trainingstag fast 500 Euro einsparen. Wenn der Verein eine Electric-Speedwaymaschine über den Tag verteilt,  z.B an 10 Fahrer vermietet, würde der Verein knapp 5000 Euro einsparen.
Wenn z.B. jeder Fahrer für die Nutzung inkl. Strom 40 Euro Miete bezahlt, könnte der Verein mit einer Electric-Speedwaymaschine 400 Euro erwirtschaften. Und das jeden Tag in der Woche, 365 Tage im Jahr und das 
mit einer einzigen Electric-Speedwaymaschine.


Was
für weitere Kosten kommen auf mich zu?
Das
was noch überbleibt sind Kosten für Hinterreifen, Kette, Kettenrad
und Kettenfett. Da wir aber auch hier versucht haben die Preise für
diese Verschleißteile zu senken, ist das nicht mehr viel und liegt
etwa 50% unter den normalen Preisen.


Kann
ich euch als Firmensponsor unterstützen?
Selbstverständlich
kannst Du als Sponsor unseren Verband unterstützen. Wir
haben für das weltweit erste Electric-Speedwayrennen verschiedene
Werbemöglichkeiten auf den Maschinen, Fahreroveralls, Internetseiten
und im Speedwaystadion. Die verschiedenen Sponsorenpakete kannst
Du über unsere Webseite: www.electric-speedway.com abrufen.

Hier
haben wir Euch die wichtigsten Fragen beantwortet. 
Solltest
Du noch weitere Informationen benötigen, schreib uns bitte direkt
eine Mail. 
Wir
werden schnellstmöglich alles beantworten, was Euch am Herzen liegt.",99.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Kidmoto Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Nelson Nigel, the founder, and CEO of Kidmoto Technologies™.</p>
<p>Kidmoto Technologies™ started in New York City in November 2016 with the vision of creating an app for providing safe airport taxi transportation for families with small children.</p>
<p>Now, due to this pandemic, Kidmoto has been forced to close its operations and has costed my team their jobs. However, I do not plan on backing out. I want to be able to pursue my advocacy to properly address child safety in vehicles and be able to continue to provide a source of living to my beloved employees who continue to put their faith in me.</p>
<p>Kidmoto's humble beginnings were made possible by those who supported me; friends, families, and amazing customers, and it would truly break my heart to watch it all fall apart and lose an amazing team whom I've already considered family.</p>
<p>I’m now fundraising to keep Kidmoto afloat and rise up against Covid-19. This cause is very important to me because I've started Kidmoto small, with almost nothing. I persisted with grit, drive, and guts, trusted my inner voice against doubt, and believed in my vision.</p>
<p>Kidmoto is my home, my family, and my everything. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Would you be willing to make a contribution to my fundraiser? I know everyone has been greatly affected but a gift of any amount would mean the world to me, my employees, and the hardworking parents who trust and support Kidmoto and its cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever we earn here will be used to keep Kidmoto on track so we can continue our advocacy and also continue to support our employees and drivers who have put so much effort into trying to raise Kidmoto up since the beginning. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal, your generous donations will be used to slowly rebuild what we have started so our team will continue to dream big.</li>
<li>Kidmoto was in such a good trajectory before the pandemic and it really pains me to see it all fade just because of Covid-19.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Thank You Token</h3>
<p>We have nothing extravagant to offer but in exchange for your generous donations, we can offer you something personalized that comes from deep within our hearts. In exchange for a minimum of $100 donation, we will make you a special vexel artwork of any high-quality photo you prefer.  It could be a photo of yourself or your loved ones.</p>
<p>A simple yet special souvenir for helping out another small business or person in need.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's okay. It would also mean a lot if you could share my fundraiser link on social media. The more exposure I get, the faster I will reach my fundraising goal.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/>I started a travel startup 2 years ago after being an Uber driver for about 5 years. Working for Uber was a great experience aside from the financial outlook. Overtime, I realized that each accomplishment I completed for Uber such as being among the 10 best marketers in driver recruitment and completing over 12,000 rides benefited me little. The only compensation I received was an email or a snail mail letter, yet the company was growing to an astronomical level before my eyes. I asked myself, ""what's the difference between being an Uber driver and driving on my own?"" I realized it was the customers. Then I came to believe that if I could gather enough people looking to go places, I would not need Uber, so I started my own <a href=""http://www.letsgo2app.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.letsgo2app.com</a></p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Airbike was a dream. Now it's a reality. I was a student, a New Columbo Scholar when I had the idea.  After riding around incredible cities on my travels, now I'm a bike guy. Convinced we need to make our cities, bike cities.</p>
<p>I love to travel, I always wondered how the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Singapore and even China were so much easier to get around than Australia. Australia with its vast distances and slow public transport. Living in Australia you need a car. I want to change that. Bicycle sharing is not for avid riders, it is not for fitness freaks, it's for you and me, the average folk. Airbike has learnt from the successes and failures to deliver the best bicycle sharing system in the world.</p>
<p>Airbike uses Australian developed geo-tracking technology in order to facilitate locking, unlocking, payment and security of a bicycle fleet. You don't need to wait, you simply find a bicycle either on the street or through our app, scan, and ride. When you arrive at your destination you simply place the bike in a non-obstructive public place and lock it to end the transaction. This means that your trip from the train station to your office is now 5 minutes instead of 15. This means that you don't need a car because you live too far away from the station, this means that finally, you can get home after having a night out. Australia has beautiful cities. They only need to be accessible! </p>
<p>If you contribute you are investing to a greener world. If you contribute you are investing in a less congested city. If you contribute you're investing in local software, however, most importantly, if you contribute you are giving yourself a faster commute. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can I help? What do I get? </h3>
<p>How can you help? </p>
<ul>
<li>Airbike is Australian owned. The students who developed this technology have raised the funds themselves to develop and purchase the first fleet. We need your help for subsequent fleets. 45,000 dollars of our goal we will allocate to bikes. The remaining 5,000 of our goal we aim to spend on our backend infrastructure. This will help us make the system faster at processing transactions, locations, and scans. Any additional funds raised will go towards purchasing more bicycles!</li>
<li>Perks for contributions</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>By contributing $10 or more you receive early access to tickets for Airbike<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> Events including our launch party as well as other campaigns that will run in cities around Australia. You will also receive a promotional code in the app to have your first 10 rides for free!</span>
</li>
<li>By contributing $30 or more you receive in addition to the above perk, an Airbike T-shirt, and starter pack. This gives you early access to our loyalty program Airbike Rewards! </li>
<li>By contributing $350 you become an Airbike Hero. In addition to the above rewards, your name, initial or company will be inscribed onto one of our news bicycles showing how you personally helped to bring the change Australia needs.</li>
<li>By contributing $2000 you become an Airbike Legend. In addition to the above rewards, Airbike Legends have exclusive access to the team behind Airbike, they get to meet the directors and give input into how we can make our cities bicycle cities. </li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>What we can do together</h3>

</div></div>","Inception
Airbike was a dream. Now it's a reality. I was a student, a New Columbo Scholar when I had the idea.  After riding around incredible cities on my travels, now I'm a bike guy. Convinced we need to make our cities, bike cities.
I love to travel, I always wondered how the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Singapore and even China were so much easier to get around than Australia. Australia with its vast distances and slow public transport. Living in Australia you need a car. I want to change that. Bicycle sharing is not for avid riders, it is not for fitness freaks, it's for you and me, the average folk. Airbike has learnt from the successes and failures to deliver the best bicycle sharing system in the world.
Airbike uses Australian developed geo-tracking technology in order to facilitate locking, unlocking, payment and security of a bicycle fleet. You don't need to wait, you simply find a bicycle either on the street or through our app, scan, and ride. When you arrive at your destination you simply place the bike in a non-obstructive public place and lock it to end the transaction. This means that your trip from the train station to your office is now 5 minutes instead of 15. This means that you don't need a car because you live too far away from the station, this means that finally, you can get home after having a night out. Australia has beautiful cities. They only need to be accessible! 
If you contribute you are investing to a greener world. If you contribute you are investing in a less congested city. If you contribute you're investing in local software, however, most importantly, if you contribute you are giving yourself a faster commute. 
 

How can I help? What do I get? 
How can you help? 

Airbike is Australian owned. The students who developed this technology have raised the funds themselves to develop and purchase the first fleet. We need your help for subsequent fleets. 45,000 dollars of our goal we will allocate to bikes. The remaining 5,000 of our goal we aim to spend on our backend infrastructure. This will help us make the system faster at processing transactions, locations, and scans. Any additional funds raised will go towards purchasing more bicycles!
Perks for contributions


By contributing $10 or more you receive early access to tickets for Airbike Events including our launch party as well as other campaigns that will run in cities around Australia. You will also receive a promotional code in the app to have your first 10 rides for free!

By contributing $30 or more you receive in addition to the above perk, an Airbike T-shirt, and starter pack. This gives you early access to our loyalty program Airbike Rewards! 
By contributing $350 you become an Airbike Hero. In addition to the above rewards, your name, initial or company will be inscribed onto one of our news bicycles showing how you personally helped to bring the change Australia needs.
By contributing $2000 you become an Airbike Legend. In addition to the above rewards, Airbike Legends have exclusive access to the team behind Airbike, they get to meet the directors and give input into how we can make our cities bicycle cities.

<h2><strong>What Makes Miles Special?</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Miles is powered by motors built right into the wheels. There are no belts to drag you down or break during a ride. You control stopping and going with a wireless remote. The carbon fiber deck is so thin that nobody will know there's a high capacity battery and smart computer hidden inside!  All this makes Miles the most portable (and sexiest) performance electric skateboard out there!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Great design. Lightweight. Built to last. HUGE power and range.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Most importantly</strong>, our support team and rider community are ready to help with any questions you might have!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>TLDR: </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>We've done this before. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>We're doing it again. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>You can trust us to deliver you an awesome board.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Hi, we're Rob and Pete.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Several years ago we met on Airbnb and found a shared passion for wheels, green energy and <strong>things that go fast</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We put our hearts and souls into designing the electric bikes of our dreams. We launched <a href=""http://www.flx.bike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FLX Bike</a> on Indiegogo in 2016. Thousands of people around the world joined the movement, raising over $2 Million for bikes in just 60 days! We got to make so many beautiful bikes for FLX fans that we actually moved into the factory to personally oversee and inspect every detail of production.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It hasn't been easy though, we were faced with challenges almost every step of the way. We learned and grew together, driven to deliver the coolest, best performing bikes for FLX riders (and we did!)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543623131/bcnwtd56azvskqwtixg7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We built a team to handle product development, manufacturing, customer service and all aspects of the business. This freed us up to pursue another dream, to <strong>develop an electric skateboard.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">When you hit the throttle and feel a powerful electric motor propel you through the city and up steep hills, it's a magical feeling. We want to share that feeling with as many people as possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've<strong> already shipped hundreds of Miles boards and people are absolutely loving them!</strong> Sure, there are a few details we'll improve for the Indiegogo production run. The only major thing is that <strong>many riders can't afford one.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>That's why we've brought Miles to Indiegogo</strong>. With a massive volume of boards, we'll be able to ship direct to you (skipping all middle men), get the price for every component down, and add awesome upgrades to the boards that are only possible with big volume.</p>

What now?</strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnVvgRcSZ58"" width=""560""></iframe></div> <p></p><p> </p><p><strong>What’s the difference between the Dual and Single?</strong></p><p>The Single has one powerful hub motor while the Dual has two.  The Single will hit speeds of 18-20 mph, but won’t accelerate or brake as fast as the Dual. </p><p>The Single comes with a basic remote with fast/slow, forward, brake and reverse functions. There is no display.</p><p>The Dual comes with a premium remote with information display and safety light on top of the basic functions. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Why do you use hub motors and not clumsy belt motors?</strong></p><p>The first electric skateboards were developed with elbow grease and off the shelf components. They were clever devices made of hobby motors bolted to skateboard wheels. We salute the pioneers that brought electric skateboarding to life!</p><p>Belt motors are typically geared down so they can achieve more torque than hub motors. The torque helps in acceleration, hill climbing and off road riding. There is a trade off however , as there are more moving parts, more friction, a loud whine and more things to break. That means range and top speed can suffer with belt motors. If you’ve ever tried to ride a board with belt motors, you can feel what a drag all those moving parts and friction can be. On or off, that friction is what robs you of speed and range.  </p><p>Now that more riders like you have embraced electric skating, technology has evolved and it's now possible to put the motor directly inside the wheel. This means that you can ride with less moving parts, less friction, less weight and more fun! It's why you can get incredible range on a Miles board and still cruise at incredible speeds.</p><p>Belt motors may be cheaper to manufacture, but for a sleek street board, they’re not for us. We wanted a fast, smooth, lightweight sexy ride that lasts for miles and miles. Hub motors were the clear choice!</p><p> </p><p><strong>What range can you get?</strong></p><p>From our testing data (and we push the boards hard!), we get the following range:</p><p>Single: 7-12 Miles</p><p>Dual: 10-18 Miles</p><p>With the airline friendly battery, you can expect about 6-14 miles from either board. </p><p><i>Your mileage will vary based on weight, terrain and speed.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Why is the Range longer than other boards?</strong></p><p>Both Single and Dual come with high capacity lithium batteries. The Single has a 108WH battery while the Dual has a 144WH battery.</p><p><em>WH = Watt Hours, is a measurement of the total energy in a battery</em></p><p>This is more capacity than popular boards like the Boosted 2 (99WH), Boosted Mini S (99WH), and Inboard (97WH).  </p><p>Not only does it have more battery capacity, but with less moving parts <strong>(NO BELTS = less friction = more efficient)</strong>, Miles boards can achieve incredible range.</p><p><em>Beware: Many electric skateboard brands (especially the budget ones) don’t even publish their battery capacity. Are they afraid you’ll find out the truth?</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I get another high capacity battery?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can <a href=""https://milespower.com/collections/miles-accessories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">get it here. </a>Choose the capacity you want. Note that the Single 3AH, Dual 4AH, and Airline Friendly 2.75AH battery can be interchanged and used in either board.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can you change the battery?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can swap the battery out in about 5 minutes. Just remove the deck lid, turn the battery off, unplug it and insert your new battery. This feature is great for those that want a looong ride!</p><p> </p><p><strong>How long does it take to charge?</strong></p><p>Typically 1-2 hours, slightly longer if completely dead. </p><p> </p><p><strong>I’m heavy, can I ride it?</strong></p><p>If you weigh less than 270 lbs, that’s a big YES. Though we often ride 2 up for a combined weight of ~350lbs, we can’t recommend it. Performance will decline with increased weight and the boards are not officially tested past 270lbs. </p><p> </p><p><strong>I’m tall, can I ride it?</strong></p><p>Yes, there’s no height limit and the board is very stable for all folks short and tall. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/brett.abbotthalverson/activity/1908051132549512"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out this review from Brett, a 6’4” Miles Rider in Folsom.</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Can you ride it with no battery or no remote?</strong></p><p>Yes! The hub motors are precision engineered for the least drag possible. Boards with belt motors (and orange wheels :P ), are a drag to push with no power. Miles is a breeze to push and cruises almost as fast as a traditional push longboard.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is this practical to use for commuting daily to work (5 miles) and shopping, etc?</strong></p><p>Yes! 5 miles is a great distance to shred on your Miles. With the Dual you'll probably make it there and back in one charge too. You’ll have the most fun if your roads are smooth and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NhR3v_pJFY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">it will sure beat uber</a>, traffic, busses etc.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I ride it underwater?</strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5BJxeR_nG4"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>The board is water resistant, not waterproof. That means you can ride through light rain and decent sized puddles but you can’t go swimming with it.</p><p>The motors are completely waterproof and can run completely underwater. The electronics and battery in the deck are not waterproof, so it’s not a good idea to submerge the whole board or ride in heavy/torrential rains. The warranty does not cover water damage.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I ride it in the Grass? </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K56GLAAIN0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>YES. You can cruise over cut grass from a dead stop but may want to get a rolling start if it's on the longer side. Grass takes more energy to roll over than asphalt, so it will slow any board down and use more battery than it would on hard surfaces.</p><p>Miles is designed for asphalt, concrete, and other hard surfaces and that's where it really shines. Don't let that stop you from getting creative though. Take the board to the golf course and shred it up if you fancy!!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I ride it Off-Road? </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kI0VkMbCwWs"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>It's not the smoothest ride we've ever had, but it definitely powers through to get you from point A to B!! While it is meant to shred the streets, the board can handle grass &amp; gravel surfaces. The Powerful Hub Motors and Extremely Durable Wheels combine to allow you to continue shredding through those rough terrains!!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I ride it in the Sand? </strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7EddqdyMtg"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>NO! Sand is too fluffy to get through on even the MIles Dual. The board just sinks in and sprays sand everywhere. You'd need big off-road tires to get over sand, and even then, only hard-packed wet sand will work. Miles is not an off-road board, but if you want to get creative you can always fly over hard dirt trails or grass!!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can it do powerslides?</strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8B14nxnjehQ"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>Yup! Can you?</p><p> </p><p><strong>How much weight can it</strong><strong> tow?</strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrwsyLrV0uY"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>We're gonna need more people next time!</p><p><strong>How does it handle cold weather? </strong></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMO-0_B4qZc"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>While this was just a few minutes at an extremely cold temperature, the board did better than us. It's tough to imagine you'll be able to ride in any weather cold enough to shut the board off!</p><p>As with all batteries, the lower the temperature, the lower the discharge rate and capacity of the battery. For example, at 10 below freezing, the battery can discharge at about 40% of its normal capacity. The board will still work at this temperature however, your max power, speed, and range will decrease... The good news is the motors and battery will heat up slightly during use to improve power and range.</p><p>There is definitely a temperature at which the battery won't be able to power on the board. Luckily, we've never been cold enough to experience this, but according to data from our battery supplier, we believe it's around -25 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, we recommend finding a loved one and cuddling up by the fire before you go out and shred ice!</p><p>Storing the board indoors at room temperature before going out into extreme cold will greatly increase the performance under cold temperatures as the internals will be closer to ideal operating temperature.</p><p><strong>What colors do Miles come in?</strong></p><p>Black and pink baby! The Miles Board comes with a swappable deck lid so you can purchase extras and swap them to fit your mood in minutes Keep an eye out because we’ll be adding more in the future! </p><p> </p><p><strong>How many watts are the Motors?</strong></p><p>We don't disclose the motor wattage because it's become industry standard to lie about motor power. You deserve better than that.</p><p>Many companies claim to have 2000W, 3000W motors when they only have 100WH batteries... </p><p>Let's calculate that out: 100WH/3000W = .05 hours of run time. If their claims were true you could only use the board for 2 minutes!</p><p>You're welcome to put the board up against top brands and compare performance, you won't be disappointed!</p><p> </p><h4><strong><a name=""support"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Support</strong></h4><p><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong></p><p>Yes, we’ve got your back with a 6 month warranty that covers the entire board from defect or malfunction under normal use. If anything on the board should stop working, just hit us up (call 833-MYMILES) and we’ll get you rolling again in no time! The warranty does not cover any damage from misuse (including water damage), tampering or unauthorized alterations/repairs. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What if it’s past the warranty or I broke it myself?</strong></p><p>No stress, we still have your back with excellent support (from real humans in the US) and will help you purchase the correct <a href=""https://milespower.com/collections/miles-accessories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">replacement component(s)</a> to get rolling ASAP.</p><p> </p><h4><strong><a name=""components"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Components</strong></h4><p><strong>Does it have lights?</strong></p><p>No. The Dual remote features a small LED safety light to use in a pinch for visibility. If you ride at night, we do recommend investing in a set of lights though. We'll have some for you to order before the campaign ends! </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiCQJlXNKJg"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p> </p><p><strong>If I wear the wheels out can I replace them?</strong></p><p>Yes you can, just loosen a few screws and swap a new one on in about 2 minutes! <a href=""https://milespower.com/products/wheels"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can find replacement wheels here.</a></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ib5l7Kh6NxQ"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p> </p><p><strong>I just crashed and broke my _____ where can I get a replacement?</strong></p><p><a href=""https://milespower.com/collections/miles-accessories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can find all replacement components here</a>.

The Mini Performance Electric Skateboard

 
Customize it to Fit Your Life

Note: You can choose your grip design below
 
What Makes Miles Special?
Miles is powered by motors built right into the wheels. There are no belts to drag you down or break during a ride. You control stopping and going with a wireless remote. The carbon fiber deck is so thin that nobody will know there's a high capacity battery and smart computer hidden inside!  All this makes Miles the most portable (and sexiest) performance electric skateboard out there!
Great design. Lightweight. Built to last. HUGE power and range.
Most importantly, our support team and rider community are ready to help with any questions you might have!
 
What's it Made Of?

 

 
 
Big Features
(Small Price)

Featherweight
Miles is almost impossibly light. The Single is only 10.5 lbs, and Dual only 12.5 lbs, That means Miles has the best performance to weight ratio of any board out there! You don't need to let a bulky, heavy board slow you down any more. Miles is easy to carry and stow so you can take it with you wherever you go! 
 

Insane Speed
Don't let the size fool you, the Miles Board has powerful brushless motors right in the wheels. Accelerate to 22+ mph and feel the wind in your hair as you zoom past traffic.
 

Ride More, Charge Less
Cruise through campus, hit the gym, shred with your friends. Spend more time riding and less time charging. 
 

Crush Hills
No more walking up hills. Hit the throttle and fly up them instead. Climb grades up to 20% with enough speed to carve around just for fun. 
 

Beat It Up
Skating is about pushing your limits.  Miles can take a beating and keep on cruising! If anything breaks, you can order a quick replacement from the Miles shop. 
 

Built To Last
The deck is made out of 100% Carbon Fiber giving it unmatched strength and a look that's guaranteed to turn heads!! 
 

Get Wet
If you ride hard you'll encounter some puddles. The undercarriage is sealed and motors completely waterproof so you can ride through some puddles and cruise in light rain. 
 

Limitless Range
Go ahead, ride across the state! Just swap in another battery when you run out of juice on the go. Bring the 99WH Airline Friendly Battery, and you'll be shredding foreign countries in no time. 
 

Smart Remote
The Miles Dual sports an LCD Display that shows everything you need to know about your board!


Battery Life of Board and Remote

Odometer for the Current Trip and Lifetime of the board

Current Speed and Top Speed of the trip

Drive mode: Forward and Backwards

TLDR: 
We've done this before. 
We're doing it again. 
You can trust us to deliver you an awesome board.
Hi, we're Rob and Pete.
Several years ago we met on Airbnb and found a shared passion for wheels, green energy and things that go fast.
We put our hearts and souls into designing the electric bikes of our dreams. We launched FLX Bike on Indiegogo in 2016. Thousands of people around the world joined the movement, raising over $2 Million for bikes in just 60 days! We got to make so many beautiful bikes for FLX fans that we actually moved into the factory to personally oversee and inspect every detail of production.
It hasn't been easy though, we were faced with challenges almost every step of the way. We learned and grew together, driven to deliver the coolest, best performing bikes for FLX riders (and we did!)

We built a team to handle product development, manufacturing, customer service and all aspects of the business. This freed us up to pursue another dream, to develop an electric skateboard.
When you hit the throttle and feel a powerful electric motor propel you through the city and up steep hills, it's a magical feeling. We want to share that feeling with as many people as possible.
We've already shipped hundreds of Miles boards and people are absolutely loving them! Sure, there are a few details we'll improve for the Indiegogo production run. The only major thing is that many riders can't afford one.
That's why we've brought Miles to Indiegogo. With a massive volume of boards, we'll be able to ship direct to you (skipping all middle men), get the price for every component down, and add awesome upgrades to the boards that are only possible with big volume.
Join us, for the ride of your life.
 - Rob, Pete and Team Miles

FAQPerformance Support Components Payments and Shipping Misc PerformanceMy Miles Arrived. What now?  What’s the difference between the Dual and Single?The Single has one powerful hub motor while the Dual has two.  The Single will hit speeds of 18-20 mph, but won’t accelerate or brake as fast as the Dual. The Single comes with a basic remote with fast/slow, forward, brake and reverse functions. There is no display.The Dual comes with a premium remote with information display and safety light on top of the basic functions.  Why do you use hub motors and not clumsy belt motors?The first electric skateboards were developed with elbow grease and off the shelf components. They were clever devices made of hobby motors bolted to skateboard wheels. We salute the pioneers that brought electric skateboarding to life!Belt motors are typically geared down so they can achieve more torque than hub motors. The torque helps in acceleration, hill climbing and off road riding. There is a trade off however , as there are more moving parts, more friction, a loud whine and more things to break. That means range and top speed can suffer with belt motors. If you’ve ever tried to ride a board with belt motors, you can feel what a drag all those moving parts and friction can be. On or off, that friction is what robs you of speed and range.  Now that more riders like you have embraced electric skating, technology has evolved and it's now possible to put the motor directly inside the wheel. This means that you can ride with less moving parts, less friction, less weight and more fun! It's why you can get incredible range on a Miles board and still cruise at incredible speeds.Belt motors may be cheaper to manufacture, but for a sleek street board, they’re not for us. We wanted a fast, smooth, lightweight sexy ride that lasts for miles and miles. Hub motors were the clear choice! What range can you get?From our testing data (and we push the boards hard!), we get the following range:Single: 7-12 MilesDual: 10-18 MilesWith the airline friendly battery, you can expect about 6-14 miles from either board. Your mileage will vary based on weight, terrain and speed. Why is the Range longer than other boards?Both Single and Dual come with high capacity lithium batteries. The Single has a 108WH battery while the Dual has a 144WH battery.WH = Watt Hours, is a measurement of the total energy in a batteryThis is more capacity than popular boards like the Boosted 2 (99WH), Boosted Mini S (99WH), and Inboard (97WH).  Not only does it have more battery capacity, but with less moving parts (NO BELTS = less friction = more efficient), Miles boards can achieve incredible range.Beware: Many electric skateboard brands (especially the budget ones) don’t even publish their battery capacity. Are they afraid you’ll find out the truth? Can I get another high capacity battery?Yes, you can get it here. Choose the capacity you want. Note that the Single 3AH, Dual 4AH, and Airline Friendly 2.75AH battery can be interchanged and used in either board. Can you change the battery?Yes, you can swap the battery out in about 5 minutes. Just remove the deck lid, turn the battery off, unplug it and insert your new battery. This feature is great for those that want a looong ride! How long does it take to charge?Typically 1-2 hours, slightly longer if completely dead.  I’m heavy, can I ride it?If you weigh less than 270 lbs, that’s a big YES. Though we often ride 2 up for a combined weight of ~350lbs, we can’t recommend it. Performance will decline with increased weight and the boards are not officially tested past 270lbs.  I’m tall, can I ride it?Yes, there’s no height limit and the board is very stable for all folks short and tall. Check out this review from Brett, a 6’4” Miles Rider in Folsom. Can you ride it with no battery or no remote?Yes! The hub motors are precision engineered for the least drag possible. Boards with belt motors (and orange wheels :P ), are a drag to push with no power. Miles is a breeze to push and cruises almost as fast as a traditional push longboard. Is this practical to use for commuting daily to work (5 miles) and shopping, etc?Yes! 5 miles is a great distance to shred on your Miles. With the Dual you'll probably make it there and back in one charge too. You’ll have the most fun if your roads are smooth and it will sure beat uber, traffic, busses etc. Can I ride it underwater?The board is water resistant, not waterproof. That means you can ride through light rain and decent sized puddles but you can’t go swimming with it.The motors are completely waterproof and can run completely underwater. The electronics and battery in the deck are not waterproof, so it’s not a good idea to submerge the whole board or ride in heavy/torrential rains. The warranty does not cover water damage. Can I ride it in the Grass? YES. You can cruise over cut grass from a dead stop but may want to get a rolling start if it's on the longer side. Grass takes more energy to roll over than asphalt, so it will slow any board down and use more battery than it would on hard surfaces.Miles is designed for asphalt, concrete, and other hard surfaces and that's where it really shines. Don't let that stop you from getting creative though. Take the board to the golf course and shred it up if you fancy!! Can I ride it Off-Road? It's not the smoothest ride we've ever had, but it definitely powers through to get you from point A to B!! While it is meant to shred the streets, the board can handle grass & gravel surfaces. The Powerful Hub Motors and Extremely Durable Wheels combine to allow you to continue shredding through those rough terrains!! Can I ride it in the Sand? NO! Sand is too fluffy to get through on even the MIles Dual. The board just sinks in and sprays sand everywhere. You'd need big off-road tires to get over sand, and even then, only hard-packed wet sand will work. Miles is not an off-road board, but if you want to get creative you can always fly over hard dirt trails or grass!! Can it do powerslides?Yup! Can you? How much weight can it tow?We're gonna need more people next time!How does it handle cold weather? While this was just a few minutes at an extremely cold temperature, the board did better than us. It's tough to imagine you'll be able to ride in any weather cold enough to shut the board off!As with all batteries, the lower the temperature, the lower the discharge rate and capacity of the battery. For example, at 10 below freezing, the battery can discharge at about 40% of its normal capacity. The board will still work at this temperature however, your max power, speed, and range will decrease... The good news is the motors and battery will heat up slightly during use to improve power and range.There is definitely a temperature at which the battery won't be able to power on the board. Luckily, we've never been cold enough to experience this, but according to data from our battery supplier, we believe it's around -25 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, we recommend finding a loved one and cuddling up by the fire before you go out and shred ice!Storing the board indoors at room temperature before going out into extreme cold will greatly increase the performance under cold temperatures as the internals will be closer to ideal operating temperature.What colors do Miles come in?Black and pink baby! The Miles Board comes with a swappable deck lid so you can purchase extras and swap them to fit your mood in minutes Keep an eye out because we’ll be adding more in the future!  How many watts are the Motors?We don't disclose the motor wattage because it's become industry standard to lie about motor power. You deserve better than that.Many companies claim to have 2000W, 3000W motors when they only have 100WH batteries... Let's calculate that out: 100WH/3000W = .05 hours of run time. If their claims were true you could only use the board for 2 minutes!You're welcome to put the board up against top brands and compare performance, you won't be disappointed! SupportIs there a warranty?Yes, we’ve got your back with a 6 month warranty that covers the entire board from defect or malfunction under normal use. If anything on the board should stop working, just hit us up (call 833-MYMILES) and we’ll get you rolling again in no time! The warranty does not cover any damage from misuse (including water damage), tampering or unauthorized alterations/repairs.  What if it’s past the warranty or I broke it myself?No stress, we still have your back with excellent support (from real humans in the US) and will help you purchase the correct replacement component(s) to get rolling ASAP. ComponentsDoes it have lights?No. The Dual remote features a small LED safety light to use in a pinch for visibility. If you ride at night, we do recommend investing in a set of lights though. We'll have some for you to order before the campaign ends!  If I wear the wheels out can I replace them?Yes you can, just loosen a few screws and swap a new one on in about 2 minutes! You can find replacement wheels here. I just crashed and broke my _____ where can I get a replacement?You can find all replacement components here. Can’t find it? Give us a call at 833-MYMILES Payments and ShippingWhen does it ship?After we get the funds from Indiegogo, we'll build the boards and deliver them as soon as possible. How long for delivery?After we build the boards, most orders outside the US will ship direct from the factory and arrive approximately 3-4 weeks after shipment. US orders will be shipped via container to San Diego and then via courier to your door, they'll arrive approximately 6 weeks after shipment from the factory. Where do you ship?We're starting with a list of 52 countries and aim to expand this reach even further. If you find there's no shipping method for your country, you can let us know where you're from here. We'll work on the logistics and reach back out if there's a solution! In our last campaign we were able to ship 99% of orders, but there were just some locations like remote islands or countries with very strict rules that were impossible to ship to. We refunded those orders when it was clear there was no other way. If for any reason we can't deliver your board, you'll get a full refund (unless you live somewhere really cool - then maybe we'll hand deliver).  How Much is Shipping?You can check the most updated shipping rate for 52 Countries by beginning the checkout process and inputting your shipping info. The rates are calculated by country, so there may be a handful of regions (remote islands etc.) with special handling rates. If that's the case, we may reach out after building your board to collect any additional fees that apply. Note: There's an additional shipping fee for orders to Hawaii ($100) and Alaska ($120). If you order from Hawaii or Alaska, we'll email you with payment instructions when the campaign ends for the additional fee.  Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?The backer is responsible, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. It is 0% in the US and varies internationally.  Can I test one at your office?Yes! Come cruise by the showroom in San Diego. Can I get a refund?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here. We'll put the funds from Indiegogo directly into producing your board, and delivering each order is important for this project to work.  MiscDo I need to wear a helmet?We strongly recommend wearing a good helmet. Accidents happen (ask Rob : D ). If you value what’s inside your head, a helmet can protect it from damage. Not only that, it’s the law in many places. Bottom line: you’re responsible for your own decisions. Please don’t come crying to us if you crack your skull or get a ticket. You may see us riding without helmets from time to time and that’s a value decision we make and own. We trust you’ll make the right decision for you each time you ride.Other protective gear can save you from scrapes if you’re new to skating, riding hard or just clumsy. Please be safe out there! Can you take it on an airplane?Both the Single (108WH) and Dual (144WH) batteries can be taken on airlines only with permission from the airline. If you plan to travel via airplane, we recommend choosing the 99WH airline friendly battery, which in the US generally does not require any airline permission. We often fly with our boards and have only encountered an issue flying out of the Tijuana airport (because it was a skateboard, not because it was electric!)  Be sure to check with the airline, airport or any governing authority when you fly.  Is it legal to ride on my roads?Please check the regulations of your jurisdiction to find out where you can or can't ride. Above all, ride safely and responsibly. Your destiny is in your hands. We just help you get there faster.Are you hiring?Yes.

<div></div>Hi, my name is Emmanuel Pena born and raised in Harlem, NY. Growing up Church has had a huge part of my upbringing. Due to this I spent a lot of my off time from school and weekends involved with church activities and clubs. My love for sharing, giving and serving began. Although I'm no longer an active member of my church, those traits are engraved in me. I've always wanted to have my own business but one that would entail the traits I hold from childhood. So where else to start than with family? My father, Victor, is 77 years old going on to 78 this year. He is strong and healthy, but as the cycle of life he is aging and as he took care of me not to long ago I must take care of him one day. That's when the idea of <a href=""http://www.9atransportation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">9A Transportation</a> began.<div><br/></div>
<div>Here is a silly pic of my dad wearing my Mom's hat :</div>

<p></p>
<p>My partner Alci and I decided to take a leap of faith and stop working for others and built our own business, <a href=""www.9atransportation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">9A Transportation</a>. This business that would bring the quality of service that everyone deserves. 9A to providing <b>non-emergency medical transportation services</b>. Also offering transportation for non-medical trips to major airports and any other trips needed by our clients.</p>
<p>We will improve services in this industry while rather than giving shareable rides, our clients will have the privacy and comfort of going from their residence <b>STRAIGHT</b> to the medical facilities.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi, my name is Emmanuel Pena born and raised in Harlem, NY. Growing up Church has had a huge part of my upbringing. Due to this I spent a lot of my off time from school and weekends involved with church activities and clubs. My love for sharing, giving and serving began. Although I'm no longer an active member of my church, those traits are engraved in me. I've always wanted to have my own business but one that would entail the traits I hold from childhood. So where else to start than with family? My father, Victor, is 77 years old going on to 78 this year. He is strong and healthy, but as the cycle of life he is aging and as he took care of me not to long ago I must take care of him one day. That's when the idea of 9A Transportation began.
Here is a silly pic of my dad wearing my Mom's hat :

   

My partner Alci and I decided to take a leap of faith and stop working for others and built our own business, 9A Transportation. This business that would bring the quality of service that everyone deserves. 9A to providing non-emergency medical transportation services. Also offering transportation for non-medical trips to major airports and any other trips needed by our clients.
We will improve services in this industry while rather than giving shareable rides, our clients will have the privacy and comfort of going from their residence STRAIGHT to the medical facilities. Unlike our competitors, that pick up multiple clients on a route that causes a twenty-minute ride into an hour and a half ride at times. Imagine a disabled family member or friend who got injured in an accident or work. Going to the doctor or perhaps physical therapy can be a difficult task when taking public transportation or having a vehicle without the specialized equipment needed. 
There is nothing better than having a family-like atmosphere service and understanding of how essential it is to be able just to make it to these medical facilities in ease. Help us here at 9A Transportation be part of your family in giving YOU the transportation service you deserve.

Here are some pics of wheelchair accessible vehicles:

    What We Need 9A Transportation will use the funds for:
Base License ($2000)
Permit ($1000)
Office Space ($4,200)

Equipment & Software ($4,800)

***Extra contributions will go toward obtaining insurance and for working capital. 
The Impact 
Your donations will help us:


Bring a ride that will take our clients from their residence directly to their medical appointments rather than sharing rides. 
Provide this service to the ever growing ""baby boomer"" population. 

Wheelchair accessible rides in New York City will have a home to reserve rides.


   Risks & Challenges The biggest risk we have as a company is competing with bigger companies that already exist here in New York City. Our competitors capitalize by bunching clients into a van or bus that causes extremely long trips. We want to change this way of business, people in need of medical attention or on their way to their doctors shouldn't have to wait to make it to their destinations.

Hundreds of millions of people moving to work somehow every day or moving to another country under emigration. The world has 3 billion forms of transport. Most of them belong to private owners and are currently not in use. We have to use them. There are millions of poor regions and household’s, that need help. We need better transport optimization, to reduce carbon dioxide and to reduce energy absorption. We want  to help.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Transportation and travel industry is a 10 trillion giant but it excludes from its wealth the humble and small owners of private means of transportation who, if included and organized through a single transportation and tourism platform, could benefit greatly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Tripholder platform enables private owners of means of transportation to gain new income and expand their budgets, contributing to the local economies. We deliver missing economic factor and contribute to the underdeveloped and local economies. We help to organize better travel industry, as well as help people from diverse social groups to get to their works and to travel better across large cities, minimizing traffic and improving ecological system. We give modern tools to manage paths and slopes of transports. We reduce costs of any private of transport activities and optimize resources. We hope, that Tripholder will connect hundreds of millions of people all over the world in one integrated community of travelers and owners of means of transportation, gathering on one platform all of us owning and seeking access to trip holding vehicle. People will be able to quickly find the way of “getting there“ by staying on Tripholder.</p>

To become one of the most friendly tool for the community is the challenge and goal. Competitors are not sleeping and this is the most dangerous risk.

</div></div>","Global platform connecting those who are looking for transportation with those who wish to offer one. More then 100 different types of transportation in one place. Everything that flies, swims or rides- you can find here! From the most common types of transportation (bus, taxi, boat) to the most craziest like balloon or dog slides! Offers are provided by commercial entities but also from private individuals. Everything we store on our balcon, in our garage, hallway, home, storage ect. could be used at Tripholder by others. We  increase transport stock by including undeveloped, unused forms of transport.


 

 


 


   tourist trip  
business trip  
moving to work  
 moving to everyday activities    
organized groups, emigrations  


 


More then 1,5 billion people travelling for tourism or business yearly. Hundreds of millions of people moving to work somehow every day or moving to another country under emigration. The world has 3 billion forms of transport. Most of them belong to private owners and are currently not in use. We have to use them. There are millions of poor regions and household’s, that need help. We need better transport optimization, to reduce carbon dioxide and to reduce energy absorption. We want  to help.

* We were invited to the accelerator GSVLabs

* We have a hundred providers so far
* They write about us

* Third place in the competition start up Business Link

 

Tripholder is a kind of sharing economy world with the peer2peer model. The innovations - our platform will combain and connect both: private and commercial offers and it's the first platform including more then 100 different types of transportation in one place! Tripholder is a tool to providers to manage and optimize their resources. We give the content management profile and reservation system to those who needs it. We implement artificial intelligence into our algorithms connecting all possible offers on one route.
Filtration of types of transport

From now You can use the types of transportation which you previously thought only. Now You can generate more adrenaline and experience with transportation at the end of the world or not far, behind the wall of Your neighbor

 


 


 more then 1,5 billion people travelling for tourism or business yearly.
the peer2peer model will be worth 900 billion of usd by the end of the year 2025.
3 billion of means of transportation belong to private hands in the World



 

1. Join our community as provider or traveler.  
2. Share our campaign with your friends or family because everybody are traveling
3. Share at social media because there could be the new travelers and providers.
4. Take the chance to get the 20% discount for many of transportations
5. Support us financially in the campaign on Indiegogo, the main costs we have below:


Tripholder Mobile application (android, ioS) - because more then 70% people in United States for example using smartphones more often then computers. 
 pilot programs in San Francisco 
relocation and activation in  United States - because of the business and private individuals mentality but also because of the chance of develop our product,  vision and network
employment, including about 4 people - because it will be needed to pilot program and daily activities.
e-marketing campaigns - because we want to be seen,
patent application including 2 algorithms - because it secure our business model and potential investments of all interesting sides.

 


Transportation and travel industry is a 10 trillion giant but it excludes from its wealth the humble and small owners of private means of transportation who, if included and organized through a single transportation and tourism platform, could benefit greatly.
Tripholder platform enables private owners of means of transportation to gain new income and expand their budgets, contributing to the local economies. We deliver missing economic factor and contribute to the underdeveloped and local economies. We help to organize better travel industry, as well as help people from diverse social groups to get to their works and to travel better across large cities, minimizing traffic and improving ecological system. We give modern tools to manage paths and slopes of transports. We reduce costs of any private of transport activities and optimize resources. We hope, that Tripholder will connect hundreds of millions of people all over the world in one integrated community of travelers and owners of means of transportation, gathering on one platform all of us owning and seeking access to trip holding vehicle. People will be able to quickly find the way of “getting there“ by staying on Tripholder.

 


 We have 100+ different types of transportation in one place providing first such a service in the world. We primarily use offers from private individuals, so we could compare ourselves to being a AirBnB service for transportation. We focus at artificial intelligence algorithms by searching, combining and connecting private and commercial offers in one place or on one route. To become one of the most friendly tool for the community is the challenge and goal. Competitors are not sleeping and this is the most dangerous risk. We are not sleeping either so it's also risk for the competitors.

 



provide solution and opportunity for economic improvement for many people
 give chance to stimulate small, local as well as nationwide businesses.
 minimize polluting problems
minimize traffic jams
overcorwding causing parking problems
help poor regions and household’s
secure the better transport optimization
reduce carbon dioxide
reduce energy absorption



 


 

 

 


 
Don't worry, we will be glad to invite Your to our system to be the member of it. We build the global transportation community and the door is always open for everyone. We hope, that the fate will be our friend and everything will be good during the implementation. So, if You like it, just support us in different way. We will be very thankful for it.",77.0,1,"1 Campaign

This will be possible to be achieved considering the fact we have other fund sources such as another live campaign, direct sales and online email contacts.



The main feature of an electric bicycle is a powerful electric engine that helps you go up very inclined paths and commute further with more ease. The Vela has a 350w engine able to deliver up to 4 times the power of a regular cyclist.




This is a public-test-ride-video we recorded in Los Angeles with random people riding and testing the Vela for the first time.
































 




If you ever need to lift it, The Vela weighs 44lbs (20kg). That's around 20% less than most electric bicycles.












With the Pure Pedal Assist System, riding the Vela is - literally - as simple as riding a regular bicycle.



























 
The Vela's LED headlight not only let's traffic know you're there, but is also designed to lighten up the street and brighten your path. It is fully connected to the main system and you won't need to charge or replace its batteries. 



The taillight is also connected to the main battery and automatically turns on with the headlight. Both have a consumption of only 2~3% of the total battery energy when they are on.

How to charge:



The bottom of the frame has a very strong neodymium magnet that keeps the battery safely secured to it. No matter how rustic is your path, your battery will always stay connected and you won’t have to listen to any metal hitting.




Some of the anti-theft special screws used to protect Vela's battery inside the frame.

<h3>Specs &amp; info</h3>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Capacity</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">: 100lb of cargo (per side)</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Electrical</b>: 30 Amp circuit, connected to the vehicle. Any competent mechanic can take care of the installation. Detailed instructions will be provided.</p>
<p><b>Base unit</b>: Passenger side. As an upgrade, a device can also be installed on the driver side (using the same RazerLift crossbars) for twice the capacity.</p>
<p><b>Control</b>: Manual buttons, infrared and probably also a Bluetooth app on your phone.</p>
<p><b>Safety</b>:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">It will have overload protection to prevent the user from exceeding 100lb.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">It will also be able to sense if it has collided with something and will stop its motion.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Though not shown in the video, it has a mechanism to lock the device in place while you are driving. We don't want things flying off when you're on the highway!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>MSRP</b>: Around $1,500 - $2,000 (we'll know better by the summer). With time we can order parts in bulk and that will help reduce the price. Buying it through this campaign will also keep the price down; just saying!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A relatively handy person should be able to install the unit with the help of a friend, though we expect most people will want to have it professionally installed. A competent mechanic should be able to install it in around 2-3 hours.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will provide detailed installation instructions for either the DIY owner, or a local mechanic if you don't live near Calgary. We will also work hard to support you during the installation process by making ourselves available either in person (if you live in/near Calgary) or by phone or Skype if you live further away.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We expect the people most interested in owning a RazerLift will be those with tall vehicles. If you own a truck, SUV/crossover, or minivan then we should have you covered. We are also working on ways to secure the RazerLift to truck canopies too.</p>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">And we will also develop adapters so you can reuse your mounting towers from Thule or Yakima. This should make it possible to mount the RazerLift to almost any vehicle on the road.</span><br/>

</div></div>","Driving.ca calls the RazerLift a ""ground breaking"" new technology that eliminates the ""backbreaking labour"" inherent in loading and unloading cargo from the roof of your vehicle.





Your vehicle roof: a great place to store stuff, a lousy place to load stuff.
The RazerLift gives you all the flexibility of roof-top storage, without standing on your seats or, worse yet, standing on your vehicle. And it works with the press of a button.


Easy enough for a child to operate: accessible enough for a child to reach.
It is designed to be extremely adaptable. This weekend you can go kayaking and next weekend you can go biking. Or use it for ladders during the week, and camping on weekends.


Specs & info
Capacity: 100lb of cargo (per side)
Electrical: 30 Amp circuit, connected to the vehicle. Any competent mechanic can take care of the installation. Detailed instructions will be provided.
Base unit: Passenger side. As an upgrade, a device can also be installed on the driver side (using the same RazerLift crossbars) for twice the capacity.
Control: Manual buttons, infrared and probably also a Bluetooth app on your phone.
Safety:


It will have overload protection to prevent the user from exceeding 100lb.

It will also be able to sense if it has collided with something and will stop its motion.

Though not shown in the video, it has a mechanism to lock the device in place while you are driving. We don't want things flying off when you're on the highway!

MSRP: Around $1,500 - $2,000 (we'll know better by the summer). With time we can order parts in bulk and that will help reduce the price. Buying it through this campaign will also keep the price down; just saying!

Installation
A relatively handy person should be able to install the unit with the help of a friend, though we expect most people will want to have it professionally installed. A competent mechanic should be able to install it in around 2-3 hours.
We will provide detailed installation instructions for either the DIY owner, or a local mechanic if you don't live near Calgary. We will also work hard to support you during the installation process by making ourselves available either in person (if you live in/near Calgary) or by phone or Skype if you live further away.
We expect the people most interested in owning a RazerLift will be those with tall vehicles. If you own a truck, SUV/crossover, or minivan then we should have you covered. We are also working on ways to secure the RazerLift to truck canopies too.

And we will also develop adapters so you can reuse your mounting towers from Thule or Yakima. This should make it possible to mount the RazerLift to almost any vehicle on the road.




Status

Tangent Engineering (an ISO certified product engineering firm) has overseen the development; the RazerLift has been designed to extremely high engineering standards. Tangent designed and built advanced stage prototypes, as shown in the promo video. We were able to support the first stage of development because of the generosity of government funding and investment capital.
Now we need some more funds to push us through to product launch. With your help we can bring this revolutionary new product to market and help reduce back and shoulder injuries.   
Specifically, we need to:



Finalize testing of Alpha prototypes.
Refine the design for Beta units.
Build and test ""market ready"" Beta versions. You can get in on the action here, if you are interested.
Line up suppliers and dealers.
Ramp up sales and marketing efforts.

We continue to secure investment capital and government funding to help cover these expenses, so you'll be happy to know we are not relying exclusively on crowdfunding. Funds raised through IndieGoGo will be used for product development and buying parts.
Your help will also be instrumental in making the RazerLift a reality for many weekend warriors and trades workers.

    Perks We are extremely grateful to everybody who is helping us upgrade the vehicle cargo management market. Depending on your level of contribution we have special ways we would like to thank you.

<p><b>How did Driver B get
started?</b></p><p>Co-founder Tara Leigh suffers from Lupus and other serious health problems, so she has become very
dependent on ride sharing as a way of getting around town affordably.  Tara is the chatty sort ('hi' and 'how are you' are *not* Tara's style--within five minutes she'll know your life history or you'll know hers, depending on which mood she's in), and talking with drivers, she learned they were growing more and more dissatisfied with how they were being paid.</p>
<p>No drivers of course means no rides, and after the fifth driver in a week told her they were
quitting due to the fact it wasn’t enough income anymore, Tara told her partner, Peter Leonas, he needed to put his techy brain on it--  “We have to
fix this problem”.  </p>
<p>So Peter spent a few weeks developing a new ride sharing model, one that incorporates both the multiple of 'helper apps' that Tara has become dependent on, as well as a fair profit sharing model with the drivers. “Ride sharing is supposed to service you, so it should be benefitting your needs while out and around town while also creating a reasonable price model so the drivers earn a living as well.""</p>

Its healthy, keeps you active, excellent for the cardiovascular system, builds muscles and is environmentally friendly. Most of us in the world live close by to public transit and by solving the last mile problem with a folding electric bike we can help to remove more cars of the road and do our part for a cleaner greener world. We wanted to create a product that had all the benefits of cycling with none of the drawbacks and electric bikes are the ultimate solution to this issue.</p><h2>Why are we going through Crowdfunding?</h2><p>The first time i tried an electric bike, I fell in love. Unfortunately for me this trial was at a local Bicycle shop and my trial was limited to 15 min.</p><p>Although I fell in love with the bike, the price was a huge barrier for me. The particular bike i tried was about 40,000 Kr (4500 USD). It had everything hidden in the frame as well as GPS tracking. Being an engineer I set out to work with a few friends of mine that had the same passion as I did and after we completed a first principles cost analysis of what every single component on an electric bike should cost and the results really surprised us.</p><p>The price was nowhere near 4500 USD in fact it was about a tenth of that price all in. We immediately set to work to find a manufacturer that could build us the bike of our dreams for the price of our dreams. </p><p>The Trifecta is what Stark Drive Electric Bikes has achieved and seemingly its contradictory in its entire nature: A High Quality, Super Affordable, Full Featured electric bike at a price that you cant even find through distributors in Asian markets. We are now ready to go into production on Stark Drive but the one variable that has us seeking funds through crowdfunding is our manufacturing partners demand of minimum order quantities. </p><p>We are passing these incredible savings onto you our backers for helping us launch the future of biking for everyone.</p><h2>Stark Drive will always be the most affordable electric bike in the world. </h2><p>As better motors are developed, they will be installed on Stark Drive, As higher capacity batteries are produced, they will be the default on Stark Drive.  </p><h3>Prediction: All Bicycles in the future will be Electric</h3><p>It has taken us 4 years to get to this point to launch Stark Drive Mini, all contracts are signed, we are ready to unleash Stark Drive Mini to the world. </p><p>My team is emphatically anticipating the first shipments in December  2018. We are constantly improving Stark Drive and with more backers we will be offering better and higher overall quality as our campaign progresses so get your friends/parents/strangers involved and tell them about Stark Drive.</p><h2>Confide in Us, We are here for you</h2><p>The Stark Drive Team is based out of New Jersey, California, Stockholm, and China. We are engineers, and specialists in finance, sourcing, logistics, and manufacturing working hard in preparation to launch Stark Drive to the world in 2017. </p><p><strong>We are working hard to improve our customer service while keeping our fixed costs unbelievably low in order to ensure we pass all the savings onto you.</strong></p><p>We are also working hard to ensure that in the near future we will have components stocked throughout the world so that if anything happens and you need replacement components they will be just a day away.  Right now we are shipping components such as the high capacity lithium batteries at considerable expense directly from our manufacturers which does require us to abide by their warranty terms. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/l0ExmnpIYOZdhaOVa/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>Our CEO and Founder Oscar Stark has been working with supply chain management and sourcing through the Asian Marketplace for the last 15 years Most recently he has been working in the manufacturing industry to build sustainable and energy efficient dwellings that are affordable in an increasingly unaffordable marketplace.</p><p>He also has 8 years of experience within the renewable energy industry and in addition to that years of electrical engineering experience.

It fits in the smallest of spaces.   USB Charging On Every Stark Drive MiniStark Drive mini is built for convenience, that being said USB is a global standard charging system rivaling even the common electrical outlet and much more convenient as you don't need any adapters.  We have included a high voltage USB port on every Stark Drive Mini to charge your phone, portable speaker or any other USB based device with ease.How can we do it for only $299?The simple answer is that we have been working with our factory building our relationship for over 2 years now and we have built a level of cooperation that ensures complete transparency both from our side but more importantly from our factory's side ensuring that the saving we achieve by cutting out all middle men and distributors can be passed onto you our new Stark Drive family.At first glance it seems impossible, but let me assure you this is real and just as we were called a 'scam' when launching Stark Drive back in 2017 but yet delivered thousands of bikes worldwide, Stark Drive Mini is our next paradigm shifting electric bike shattering the market prices for electric bikes.Your Perfectly Configurable CompanionAt Stark Drive we believe that you should get the exact bike you want with the features and options that are best for you and when we launched Stark Drive in 2017 we reaffirmed our dedication to customization enabling any of our backers then to add whatever features they felt they needed most.  Compared to other electric bikes on the market, this make the assembly process considerably more challenging and we worked hard to improve our processes to ensure that every single feature, color and specification that our backers wanted were delivered to them.With Stark Drive Mini we continue this with the ability to select multiple features and even to configure Mini with the perfect bike computer, simply select from one of the bike computers below which offer different features and form factors. Choose your Display (Basic to Advanced Options):Standard Features  Recommended Upgrades: Carbon Belt Drive or Regular Chain System  As a backer of Stark Drive Mini we are offering you the opportunity to configure Mini with either a standard metal chain system (one that requires regular lubrication or you can choose a Carbon Belt Drive system that wares more evenly, requires no lubrication, is non dirty and lasts significantly longer then a standard chain based system.GPS Tracking OptionalOur GPS Tracking solution works with your mobile phone or any laptop anywhere in the world through both the cellular network and GPS combined.  Track your bike to within a few meters or even get SMS alerts when your bike moves without you being near it.  Stolen bikes will be a thing of the past.  Of course we hide the hardware on the bike so no one will even know its there. 
 
               
    Biking is our Passion    We love biking throughout the year, rain or shine. Its healthy, keeps you active, excellent for the cardiovascular system, builds muscles and is environmentally friendly. Most of us in the world live close by to public transit and by solving the last mile problem with a folding electric bike we can help to remove more cars of the road and do our part for a cleaner greener world. We wanted to create a product that had all the benefits of cycling with none of the drawbacks and electric bikes are the ultimate solution to this issue.Why are we going through Crowdfunding?The first time i tried an electric bike, I fell in love. Unfortunately for me this trial was at a local Bicycle shop and my trial was limited to 15 min.Although I fell in love with the bike, the price was a huge barrier for me. The particular bike i tried was about 40,000 Kr (4500 USD). It had everything hidden in the frame as well as GPS tracking. Being an engineer I set out to work with a few friends of mine that had the same passion as I did and after we completed a first principles cost analysis of what every single component on an electric bike should cost and the results really surprised us.The price was nowhere near 4500 USD in fact it was about a tenth of that price all in. We immediately set to work to find a manufacturer that could build us the bike of our dreams for the price of our dreams. The Trifecta is what Stark Drive Electric Bikes has achieved and seemingly its contradictory in its entire nature: A High Quality, Super Affordable, Full Featured electric bike at a price that you cant even find through distributors in Asian markets. We are now ready to go into production on Stark Drive but the one variable that has us seeking funds through crowdfunding is our manufacturing partners demand of minimum order quantities. We are passing these incredible savings onto you our backers for helping us launch the future of biking for everyone.Stark Drive will always be the most affordable electric bike in the world. As better motors are developed, they will be installed on Stark Drive, As higher capacity batteries are produced, they will be the default on Stark Drive.  Prediction: All Bicycles in the future will be ElectricIt has taken us 4 years to get to this point to launch Stark Drive Mini, all contracts are signed, we are ready to unleash Stark Drive Mini to the world. My team is emphatically anticipating the first shipments in December  2018. We are constantly improving Stark Drive and with more backers we will be offering better and higher overall quality as our campaign progresses so get your friends/parents/strangers involved and tell them about Stark Drive.Confide in Us, We are here for youThe Stark Drive Team is based out of New Jersey, California, Stockholm, and China. We are engineers, and specialists in finance, sourcing, logistics, and manufacturing working hard in preparation to launch Stark Drive to the world in 2017. We are working hard to improve our customer service while keeping our fixed costs unbelievably low in order to ensure we pass all the savings onto you.We are also working hard to ensure that in the near future we will have components stocked throughout the world so that if anything happens and you need replacement components they will be just a day away.  Right now we are shipping components such as the high capacity lithium batteries at considerable expense directly from our manufacturers which does require us to abide by their warranty terms. Our CEO and Founder Oscar Stark has been working with supply chain management and sourcing through the Asian Marketplace for the last 15 years Most recently he has been working in the manufacturing industry to build sustainable and energy efficient dwellings that are affordable in an increasingly unaffordable marketplace.He also has 8 years of experience within the renewable energy industry and in addition to that years of electrical engineering experience. His goal will be and has always been to get the best price and highest quality components and deliver the savings to the world.TEST RIDE STARK DRIVE Anyone in the Stockholm (Sweden) area that wants to test drive Stark Drive is welcome to contact us to arrange a time (hello@starkdrive.com) at our showroom at Wargentingsgatan 5, Stockholm.",37.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>1) “One study found that no-shows cost the U.S. health care system more than $150 billion a year and individual physicians an average of $200 per unused time slot.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) “Transportation barriers are often cited as barriers to healthcare access. Transportation barriers lead to rescheduled or missed appointments, delayed care, and missed or delayed medication use. These consequences may lead to poorer management of chronic illness and thus poorer health outcomes.”</p>

<h3>Who will keep the AV’s clean in-between pick ups?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>KOnnect will have a dedicated disinfectant crew that will be responsible for charging and cleaning each vehicle in between pickups.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Are there any benefits for the rider?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, along with not having to drive and hassle with parking at the hospital/clinic, patients enjoy the satisfaction of a reduced wait time (if any), as the Hospital staff will be expecting them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Okay, so.. no driver?! What kind of car will pick me up?</h3>

Its 2000-Watt, DC Brushless motor will have you cruising at speeds of 30 mph for a scooter range of up to 40 miles.  With absolutely ZERO emissions, riding your scooter is as good for the environment as it is good your spirit! Equipped with Bluetooth, USB port, FM radio and speakers, this sleek design comes in colors of silver, black, and blue in a matte finish. Red available in gloss only. Your order will ship in September.Park easily in crowded cities, charge the battery while you’re at work, and feel good about your commute. Be one of the first to own this affordable and electric scooter, the only kind in its class of scooters made available in America.Ted Fuller began thinking about designing a scooter for the electric 21st century. With gas prices on the rise and America becoming more eco-conscious, Ted had a vision to make environmentally-friendly and affordable transportation available to people of all ages. Ted dreamt up the CruZer Scooter e2000 which includes digital age features, such as Bluetooth, USB Port, and LCD lighting. He also designed his scooter to have more leg room, space for a passenger, and seat storage so you can cruise comfortably in style with everything you need.Ted was then off to build his company and traveled to China to find a manufacturer to build the only electric scooter in its class made available for America. Within 3 years, he had his first prototype. Ted then worked to perfect this model and three additional prototypes later, the CruZer Scooter e2000 was born. Though the whole process took 5 years, it was certainly worth it. The CruZer Scooter e2000 meets all the Department of Transportation and Environment Protection Agency standards and is reasonable priced to boot.Features:
Founder, Ted Fuller wanted a scooter for the 21st century, and has equipped the CruZer Scooter with exciting features, such as an LCD Digital Dashboard
LCD Panel Lights and LED Headlights and Driving Lights
Bluetooth, USB port, FM radio and speakers
2000-Watt Motor
Disc Brakes
12” Tires
Longer-than-average moped seating to seat two people comfortably.
Under-seat Storage
LED Brake Light
72V30Ah Battery
Risk & Challenges:While he had hoped the scooters could be made in the US, Ted found the costs were prohibitive. He knew that China was the largest manufacturing center in the world, and it proved to be the place to build his scooter with a manufacturer who agreed to take on the task.Ted’s challenge has been getting the word out and making people aware the CruZer Scooter is in production and available to own.WarrantyManufacture warrants to the original retail purchaser that the CruZer Scooter for which this warranty has been issued is free from defects in material and workmanship as follows:

<p><b>STEP ONE: </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465480133/installation01_swp1mq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Find the flattest <b>non-moving</b> part on the upright post of the frame (near the bottom if possible) that your handle bars are connected to. Without attaching The Bicycle Mirror®, position it onto the frame so that when you look down onto it from a seated position, you can see what is directly behind you. Care should be taken when bending the black arm at the bike side, and it is best to bend the black tube with both hands and swiveling the mirror as shown in the video above. This is just to give you an idea of where it needs to be. Remember that the <b>cable tie is removable</b> so getting the position wrong on your first try is not serious. Fine adjustments can be made after full installation.</p>
<p><b>STEP TWO:</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465480189/installation2_yflycr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When closing the cable tie, thread the cable tie and pull it closed until it cannot go any tighter. Once The Bicycle Mirror® is stable and secure on the bicycle, either cut off the excess cable tie or tuck it in if the mirror will need to be removed regularly.</p>
<p><b>STEP THREE: </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465480279/installation3_dtsq8y.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Adjust the The Bicycle Mirror® so that your body parts or handlebars do not obstruct your view, or touch the mirror … normally only very gentle tweaks are all that will be necessary once on the road to get the final position. Finally feel safer and enjoy the experience! Please note that the attachment fits on most bicycle frames, but may not fit all.</p>

on the roads, so I decided to design a bicycle mirror that would help me to not
have to look over my shoulder all the time, helping me to feel safer and more
in control on the road. In the early days I created a mirror for
my arm, and then one on for my handle bars, but I was not able to get a static clear rear view.
After 3 years and many adjustments I
created a rear view mirror that was able to give me exactly what I needed : A static rear view from a mirror that
mounts onto the frame of the bicycle, so that one's line of sight is not
interrupted like is the case with most conventional mirrors                      
Stacey then came on board with her business and entrepreneurial
skills and together we joined forces, to tweak the Bicycle mirror until we were
happy that the product was as close to perfect as possible. And here we are today, proud to present this
evolution in cycle safety:                                                                 The Bicycle
Mirror®THE REALITY


Most cycling deaths and injuries are caused by
cyclists being hit from behind. Having a clear, rear view is not only a good
idea.....It's a necessity! 

We think it is just crazy that every vehicle on the
road relies on a rear view mirror for safe passage and that almost all cyclists,
who ride the most vulnerable vehicles on the road (bicycles) have no mirrors on
their bikes!?    The Bicycle Mirror® aims to  put 
more  power  into the 
hands  of  the 
cyclists by allowing them to have a wider field of vision, which  will 
help  to  create  safer cycling environments for both motorists and the cyclists as they often
share the same space. This product has the potential to save many lives and
prevent countless debilitating injuries!!!FEATURES - The Bicycle Mirror has a swivel function ensuring a perfect line of sight, so        that nothing takes you by surprise!


- It has a re-usable attachment, so it can be used for many different types of bicycles. -A flexible stem that adjusts to suit your view.
- It takes seconds to put on and take off, so minimal time is used! 
-The mirror is shorter than the handle bars so it doesn't get in the way.
 -The convex lens allows an even wider angle of vision, so that you're able to    clearly see everything that’s going on around you!INSTALLATION 
STEP ONE: 

Find the flattest non-moving part on the upright post of the frame (near the bottom if possible) that your handle bars are connected to. Without attaching The Bicycle Mirror®, position it onto the frame so that when you look down onto it from a seated position, you can see what is directly behind you. Care should be taken when bending the black arm at the bike side, and it is best to bend the black tube with both hands and swiveling the mirror as shown in the video above. This is just to give you an idea of where it needs to be. Remember that the cable tie is removable so getting the position wrong on your first try is not serious. Fine adjustments can be made after full installation.
STEP TWO:

When closing the cable tie, thread the cable tie and pull it closed until it cannot go any tighter. Once The Bicycle Mirror® is stable and secure on the bicycle, either cut off the excess cable tie or tuck it in if the mirror will need to be removed regularly.
STEP THREE: 

Adjust the The Bicycle Mirror® so that your body parts or handlebars do not obstruct your view, or touch the mirror … normally only very gentle tweaks are all that will be necessary once on the road to get the final position. Finally feel safer and enjoy the experience! Please note that the attachment fits on most bicycle frames, but may not fit all.

MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE 

We are an energetic, purpose driven team who strive to make a difference in the lives of people around us, one Bicycle Mirror and one child at a time! One amazing organization that will benefit from a large percentage of The Bicycle Mirror's proceeds once we are up and running is“ Newkidz on the Block”.Newkidz on the Block is an organisation in South Africa that creates awareness of the close to 4 Million orphans in their country. Newkidz promotes hosting, fostering and adoption of orphan children, and they get large groups of volunteers to do extreme makeovers at Children's Homes, Shelters for abused women and children and other places of safety for children.         OUR JOURNEY TO INFINITY AND BEYONDMEET THE TEAM

We will provide all the documentation necessary to ensure the quality of the maintenance process. </p><p> </p><h3><a name=""tech"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technical</a></h3><p><strong>How heavy are the X-Series ebikes?</strong></p><p>The FURO X-Series ebikes are some of the lightest on the market thanks to their advanced electric technology and state-of-the-art carbon frames. Their weights with battery are as follows:</p><p>FX (all models): 14kgs</p><p>SX (all models): 19kgs</p><p><strong>How do you charge the battery and how long does it take?</strong></p><p>The FX’s battery can be charged either on or off the bike. With our standard 2A charger, the 8.7Ah takes around 4.5hrs to charge while the 10.5Ah battery takes 5.5hrs. Our fast 5A charger will charge the 8.7Ah battery in less than 2hrs and the 10.5Ah battery in less than 2.5hrs.</p><p>The SX’s battery charging port can only be accessed by removing the battery compartment’s cover. It can then either be removed or left on the bike to be charged. With our standard 2A charger, the 10.4Ah takes around 5.5hrs to charge while the 14Ah battery takes approximately 7hrs. Our fast 5A charger will charge the 10.4Ah battery in 2.5hrs and the 14Ah battery in about 3hrs.</p><p><strong>Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?</strong></p><p>Yes, our chargers are rated 100-240V. They work in every country. </p><p><strong>Can you charge the bike by pedalling to increase range?</strong></p><p>No, to put it simply, if you still want to move while recharging and not just pedal in the air like on an indoor spinning machine, some of your pedalling power will go to moving the wheels on the ground while another part will go to recharging the battery through the motor which becomes a generator. In that case, pedalling is firstly much harder than if you just were pedalling to go somewhere because a big chunk of the power you apply on the wheels goes to the battery. Even worse, due to the laws of thermodynamics, only 80% of the power diverted to the battery is actually converted to electricity. This means that if you had applied that power towards cycling in the first place you would have gotten home much faster and more easily. In the end, it just makes much more sense to use your pedalling for moving than for charging!</p><p><strong>Can you remove the wheels if you need to put it in a car?</strong></p><p>Yes, all four wheels on the X-Series can be easily removed with tools we provide in our packaging. However, the FX's back wheel will have to be kept close to the bike in order not to rip the BAFANG hub motor's cables.</p><p><strong>What happens if I get a Puncture?</strong></p><p>Punctures can happen when going off road or riding long distances in the city. Changing the tires of the SX is as easy as changing those on a normal bike. The FX’s front wheel is standard as well, however the back wheel will require a bit more attention as to not rip the cables of the hub motor. However, with care it is as straightforward as any bicycle wheel.</p><p><strong>How much maintenance does the motor require?</strong></p><p>Our BAFANG rear motor and BOFEILI mid motor are brushless DC motors which fundamentally require very low maintenance. Add to that the fact that their manufacturers have been doing them for years, testing them with thousands of customers, and even more thousands of kilometres, they require VERY low maintenance. If they were to fail, replacing them through your local shop or at home with our documentation will be quick and easy.</p><p> </p><h3><a name=""leg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Legal</a></h3><p><strong>Do I need a license or registration for the FX or SX?</strong></p><p>No you do not need any of that. Simply get on your bike and go! We offer two versions of each bike, a 250W version which is completely road legal all over the world and a 350W one for the United States. The FX and SX boast the highest possible power whilst remaining road legal. It is also important to note that these powers are nominal average powers. The motors powering the X-Series can actually peak at 500W (250W nominal) or 600W (350W nominal) for short amounts of time.</p><p>Make sure you get the right bike for your jurisdiction!</p><p><strong>What’s the top speed of the Bike?</strong></p><p>The FX 250 and SX 250 are electronically limited to 25km/h while the FX 350 and SX 350 are limited to 32km/h. For legal reasons, respectively above 25km/h or 32km/h the motor cuts out and the rider's pedaling power becomes the only thing that can increase velocity. Our bikes all have a speedometer in their display, so you can see exactly how fast you are going.  </p><p><strong>Do I need to wear a helmet?</strong></p><p>They are required by law in some places and optional in other places.</p><p> </p><h3><a name=""pas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Payments and Shipping</a></h3><p><strong>How much is shipping?</strong></p><p>Our bikes are delivered straight from our factory in Asia, to your door, anywhere in the world, at a fixed rate of €300.</p><p><strong>Can I pick the bike up in London and avoid the shipping charge?</strong></p><p>Sorry, obviously it would be a pleasure to meet you face to face but our bikes are shipped straight to your door from our factory by land and sea.

Help us bring the X-series to the world!  As engineers, we worked on advanced research projects immersed in space science and autonomous drone vehicles. While evolving in these fields, we experienced first-hand the implications that sustainable technology has for the future of humanity.An increasing population and the widespread use of heavy and bulky combustion engine vehicles is making transportation slower and very cumbersome. Some of the tech we used and developed could solve these issues, but not at the expense of elegance and style.That’s why we founded FuroSystems: to accelerate society’s transition to electric means of transportation through beautiful, practical and highly performant vehicles.The X-Series is our first contribution to this goal, and will help us develop and bring to you new types of vehicles, such as the L1. We want to make your journeys a lot faster, a lot more fun and a lot cleaner, while making sure you look the coolest. We are two engineers and entrepreneurs, Eliott Wertheimer and Albert Nassar, who founded FuroSystems over a year ago, to develop our vision of what the future of transportation should be.We both met at the University of Bristol where Eliott studied aerospace engineering, specialising in advanced space systems. Albert studied mechanical engineering, specialising in robotics and autonomous drone systems. We worked on complex engineering projects, such as proof of concept radioisotope thermoelectric generators for nanosatellites and drones for autonomous wind turbine inspection.We both went on to study innovation and management at Imperial College London, completing our technical background with the business knowledge necessary to quickly and reliably bring your bikes to you. You can trust us to give you the best we’ve got and make your life a lot easier thanks to our X-Series ebikes.All of this to say, that we shared a lot of professional and personal experiences together and have accumulated deep and hands on know-how to provide you with the best of what is possible today.Iman is a young and successful content creator and marketing wizard who impressed us with his talent.

has become easier and production costs are sinking. For full power, «HTDS

progress in regard to mass production costs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But we have one much greater challenge: the range.
We do not need these motors to have 300 kW of power in a car. That much power simply
drains the battery too quickly. The real challenge is starting a car on a slope
(high starting torque) and to consume as little power as possible at 130 km/h.
This is where we see the biggest challenges. It is precisely because of this
that we need to build this motor, analyze it, and drive with it. All the theory

<p>DENZEL MOTORS a well-known name amongst enthusiasts, creating and developing electric vehicles and spare parts from 2013. Since then we have mainly focused on the manufacturing of carbon fibre bikes and their associated parts. Our company has invested heavily in our own testing laboratory where a team of specialists put bikes and components through exacting tests. This enables us to make durable, low-maintenance electric bikes.  </p>

<p>Our mission is to bring to the world an eco-friendly truly affordable electric cafe racer with impressive specs.  We have spent weeks and months in our workshop creating a number of prototypes and testing them heavily. When we designed the ECR V1  we had two things in mind: style &amp; quality.   </p>

<p>To us, design is everything, because everything we own is an extension of ourselves. Retro motorcycle designs always stood out to us as sleek and elegant and we used that as inspiration to build an electric motorcycle that is truly unique. We are passionate about adventure and aesthetics, and that is why we do what we do to share our passion with others. We are DENZEL Electric Cycles and we build Bold electric bikes.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>New generation High Power 3.7V 50Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePo4) cell.</i></p>
<p><i><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4)</span></strong></i></p>
<p>Phosphate based technology possesses superior thermal and chemical stability which provides better safety characteristics than those of Lithium-ion technology made with other cathode materials. Lithium phosphate cells are incombustible in the event of mishandling during charge or discharge, they are more stable under overcharge or short circuit conditions and they can withstand high temperatures without decomposing. When abuse does occur, the phosphate based cathode material will not burn and is not prone to thermal runaway. Phosphate chemistry also offers a longer cycle life. A LiFePO4 battery is expected to last twice as many life cycles as a Lithium-ion battery. Charging time is twice as less if compared to Li-Ion batteries.</p>
<p><i><strong>Intelligent BMS</strong></i></p>
<p>ECR is powered by advanced 72 volts LiFePo4  battery pack equipped with intelligent wireless Denzel BMS.  One important feature of the  battery management system is to provide the user with the overall  health of the battery.  Denzel BMS monitors the internal resistance of each cell and tracks the capacity of the weakest cell. It uses this information to calculate a cell health percentage value from 0 to 100%. Denzel BMS then compares the calculated cell health information against preprogrammed thresholds and if any cells (or the entire pack) fall short of the threshold, a trouble code is set and freeze frame data is stored for later analysis.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/4EFCLH6NJEaSR5JOuB/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Denzel BMS implements an extensive list of features designed to protect the battery pack.</p>
<p>These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn  bike on/off from your phone</li>
<li>Control over 80 parameters of the battery from mobile phone</li>
<li>Real-time range monitor</li>
<li>Real-time discharge monitor</li>
<li>State of charge calculations</li>
<li>Cell over-voltage and under-voltage protection</li>
<li>Intelligent battery balancing</li>
<li>Battery charger control</li>
<li>Pack temperature monitoring</li>
<li>Monitors health of each cell in real-time</li>
<li>Charges/discharges history log</li>
<li>Health state and cycles log</li>
</ul>
<p>Cells are protected from over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, over-temperature, and under-temperature based on the programmed minimum and maximum values in the battery profile.</p>
<p>Intelligent, efficient cell by cell balancing is provided to maximize the usable range of the battery. Denzel BMS also monitors the health of both individual cells and the total pack and will trigger error trouble codes if either the pack or individual cells are in poor health.</p>

<p>Cafe racers were popular 50-plus years ago, and they are currently enjoying a resurgence with all the major motorcycle manufacturers producing some sort of cafe racer model to capitalize on this uptick. It’s no surprise at all that founders Alex Guliyants and Igor Tarkh blessed the ECR V1 with the same DNA  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNda2rGWjyWx2RPyw/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>ECR V1 stands out because of its design that recalls the form of a 1960’s cafe racer motorcycle. The result is a bike that boldly brings together the newest battery and motor technology with a stylish motif of the past.  </p>
<p>Spanish and Russian designers Pablo Baranoff Dorn and Alex Guliyants have envisioned the future of Honda motorcycles with this futuristic concept.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517238637/cya7ncaqscetuowhxr4n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Dubbed the “Electric Café Racer V1,” this idea is a re-modeling of a Honda Café Racer 125cc, transforming it from its traditional engine oil system to a more sustainable electric battery system. Designed from scratch the frame, seat, rims, hubs, lights and front and rear suspension.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517238713/kxu1fjait1nybky4hzku.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have given ECR our own, laboratory-developed, proven, hi-torque DENZEL 7.5Kw – direct mid-drive motor. This incredibly efficient system channels the power directly from the motor to the rear wheel via a strong , constant tension chain. Not only does direct drive minimize friction loss by eliminating clutches and gears, but it also helps eliminate the need for routine  power-train maintenance whilst  reducing the weight of the motorcycle. In cooperation with  KELLY we have developed DNZ KLS7218SW controller incorporating our custom firmware that improves cruise control and  analogue brake features. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>First ECR without battery is almost ready</i></p>
<p>Compared to the traditional petrol motorcycles sold over the last few decades, using neither a clutch nor any gears in its transmission and, with no exhaust pipe, radiator, petrol tank or hanging hoses, ECR V1 is a leap forward in performance, reliability and usability.  </p>

<p>Our starting point when developing a new model is always to produce the very best product for passionate (and demanding) riders. We dedicate a lot of attention to the finish, and carefully select an optimum set of components. If that isn’t possible with existing components, we develop our own.  All our bikes are hand-built and meticulously checked before shipping to our backers. Each individual bike is thoroughly tested and put through a comprehensive inspection, so we can guarantee they meet the highest standards of quality.</p>

<p>We've worked day and night for the past two years to build what fans are calling the coolest and most affordable electric motorcycle in the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517240593/dayw8sdgehx2edjatkgg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As motorcycle enthusiasts, we wanted the best and simply could not accept to hear the words it's not possible.  Many people have told us we couldn’t make a powerful electric motorcycle for under $5000. So – there you have it: we’re bringing our challenge to YOU for even less. They all said that the power will be too weak, the battery life would be too short and in the end it will look also ugly. All that negativity simply  motivated us to prove to all the ‘Doubters’ that it CAN be done, that we can build a stylish electric motorcycle at an incredible price. We began to brainstorm on how to achieve this. We needed ECR to be lightweight, modular, strong, streamlined and – most importantly – affordable.…And we finally found a way! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521039623/oy7km3ud83z0anyhdmso.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>We've built a number of prototypes that all turned out to be too expensive, so we started pondering how to reduce the cost of manufacturing without sacrificing the quality. The most effective way we found to be able to do this was to resource all the parts in bulk.</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Support</h3>
<p>Electric motorbikes presently retail from between $7,500 – to $15,000+. We wanted retail a final product for under $5,000 and we are offering even better deals for our early supporters. </p>
<p> We're offering to build you electric motorcycle at the cost of production, so we aren't making money out of it. In return we need your support to raise money for certification and homologation to make ECR street legal. After certification is done ECR V1 will be retailed $5000 at the dealer shops.Crowd-funding enables us to keep the costs down as we can work together with factories  to produce the right amount of units, without dealing with high storage costs and other related overheads</p>
<p>… This is where we need your help as – with your support – when we reach our goal, DENZEL ECR V1 will become a reality – with you as a contributor being able to support the electric cafe racer  for the best possible price.</p>
<p>We want to raise the standard and give everyone the opportunity to enjoy the finer things. Don’t settle for second best. Go for more. Help us make this happen by being an early supporter.</p>

<p><strong>We've self funded and thoroughly tested 4 fully functioning prototypes and are now focused on:  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making final tweaks to designs</li>
<li>Finalizing quality control systems</li>
<li>Developing accessories </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The funds raised will be used for:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mass production</li>
<li> Homologation</li>
<li>Certification</li>
<li>Creating an international network of distributors and service stores</li>
</ul>
<p>We've been working on ECR for over a year. Unlike many of the larger technology projects on Indiegogo, Igor and Alex have completely funded the project themselves. It's been a long road and they've given up everything to bring their dreams to the world. Your support will allow us to offer you a better electric motorcycle and prove that affordable electric transportation is a reality.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","About ECR
DENZEL ECR V1-one of the most stylish, powerful and affordable electric motorcycles ever offered on the market. ECR aka Electric Cafe Racer is designed as a perfect daily commuter or weekend cruiser. From teenager to veteran. For women and for men. From cruising to racing.

As seen on:






Equipped with a mind-blowing array of features, it comes complete with cruise control, on-board fast charger, Safety lights and Fully-Adjustable Suspension. DENZEL ECR is a serious performer driven by a powerful 7.5Kw mid-drive motor,reaching a top speed 100kph/62mph  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DENZEL MOTORS a well-known name amongst enthusiasts, creating and developing electric vehicles and spare parts from 2013. Since then we have mainly focused on the manufacturing of carbon fibre bikes and their associated parts. Our company has invested heavily in our own testing laboratory where a team of specialists put bikes and components through exacting tests. This enables us to make durable, low-maintenance electric bikes.  

Our mission is to bring to the world an eco-friendly truly affordable electric cafe racer with impressive specs.  We have spent weeks and months in our workshop creating a number of prototypes and testing them heavily. When we designed the ECR V1  we had two things in mind: style & quality.   

To us, design is everything, because everything we own is an extension of ourselves. Retro motorcycle designs always stood out to us as sleek and elegant and we used that as inspiration to build an electric motorcycle that is truly unique. We are passionate about adventure and aesthetics, and that is why we do what we do to share our passion with others. We are DENZEL Electric Cycles and we build Bold electric bikes.  

 
ECR features

New generation High Power 3.7V 50Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePo4) cell.
Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4)
Phosphate based technology possesses superior thermal and chemical stability which provides better safety characteristics than those of Lithium-ion technology made with other cathode materials. Lithium phosphate cells are incombustible in the event of mishandling during charge or discharge, they are more stable under overcharge or short circuit conditions and they can withstand high temperatures without decomposing. When abuse does occur, the phosphate based cathode material will not burn and is not prone to thermal runaway. Phosphate chemistry also offers a longer cycle life. A LiFePO4 battery is expected to last twice as many life cycles as a Lithium-ion battery. Charging time is twice as less if compared to Li-Ion batteries.
Intelligent BMS
ECR is powered by advanced 72 volts LiFePo4  battery pack equipped with intelligent wireless Denzel BMS.  One important feature of the  battery management system is to provide the user with the overall  health of the battery.  Denzel BMS monitors the internal resistance of each cell and tracks the capacity of the weakest cell. It uses this information to calculate a cell health percentage value from 0 to 100%. Denzel BMS then compares the calculated cell health information against preprogrammed thresholds and if any cells (or the entire pack) fall short of the threshold, a trouble code is set and freeze frame data is stored for later analysis.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Denzel BMS implements an extensive list of features designed to protect the battery pack.
These features include:

Turn  bike on/off from your phone
Control over 80 parameters of the battery from mobile phone
Real-time range monitor
Real-time discharge monitor
State of charge calculations
Cell over-voltage and under-voltage protection
Intelligent battery balancing
Battery charger control
Pack temperature monitoring
Monitors health of each cell in real-time
Charges/discharges history log
Health state and cycles log

Cells are protected from over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, over-temperature, and under-temperature based on the programmed minimum and maximum values in the battery profile.
Intelligent, efficient cell by cell balancing is provided to maximize the usable range of the battery. Denzel BMS also monitors the health of both individual cells and the total pack and will trigger error trouble codes if either the pack or individual cells are in poor health.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Denzel BMS controls over 80 different battery parameters
 

Cafe racers were popular 50-plus years ago, and they are currently enjoying a resurgence with all the major motorcycle manufacturers producing some sort of cafe racer model to capitalize on this uptick. It’s no surprise at all that founders Alex Guliyants and Igor Tarkh blessed the ECR V1 with the same DNA  
 
 
ECR V1 stands out because of its design that recalls the form of a 1960’s cafe racer motorcycle. The result is a bike that boldly brings together the newest battery and motor technology with a stylish motif of the past.  
Spanish and Russian designers Pablo Baranoff Dorn and Alex Guliyants have envisioned the future of Honda motorcycles with this futuristic concept.

Dubbed the “Electric Café Racer V1,” this idea is a re-modeling of a Honda Café Racer 125cc, transforming it from its traditional engine oil system to a more sustainable electric battery system. Designed from scratch the frame, seat, rims, hubs, lights and front and rear suspension.  

We have given ECR our own, laboratory-developed, proven, hi-torque DENZEL 7.5Kw – direct mid-drive motor. This incredibly efficient system channels the power directly from the motor to the rear wheel via a strong , constant tension chain. Not only does direct drive minimize friction loss by eliminating clutches and gears, but it also helps eliminate the need for routine  power-train maintenance whilst  reducing the weight of the motorcycle. In cooperation with  KELLY we have developed DNZ KLS7218SW controller incorporating our custom firmware that improves cruise control and  analogue brake features. 

Heart of the ECR V1 - DNZ D7500

One of the first prototypes to be built

First prototype is half assembled

DENZEL motor delivers 7.5Kw of silent, smooth power, minimizing wheel spin and improving traction.

Controller is attached and connected  to motor

First ECR without battery is almost ready
Compared to the traditional petrol motorcycles sold over the last few decades, using neither a clutch nor any gears in its transmission and, with no exhaust pipe, radiator, petrol tank or hanging hoses, ECR V1 is a leap forward in performance, reliability and usability.  

This is an outstanding bike that will surpass your riding dreams.​
Our principle: add nothing to the machine unless it enhances the experience. ECR's motor features a single moving part, no messy fluids, no clutch, and no transmission. We made it to be a simple, durable, low-maintenance machine that is built to last.  

Second prototype is going to be built

Improved design applied



3D printed tank fitted

Final tweaks have been done

LED old school headlight is perfectly fit the cafe racer style

Adjustable air rear cushions



Our starting point when developing a new model is always to produce the very best product for passionate (and demanding) riders. We dedicate a lot of attention to the finish, and carefully select an optimum set of components. If that isn’t possible with existing components, we develop our own.  All our bikes are hand-built and meticulously checked before shipping to our backers. Each individual bike is thoroughly tested and put through a comprehensive inspection, so we can guarantee they meet the highest standards of quality.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• No need to change fuel filter • No need to check oil • No need to change oil or oil filters • No need to replace spark plugs • No need to replace clutch • No need to adjust clutch cables • No need to check clutch fluid levels • No need to replace timing belt • No need to sync throttle and idle speed • No need to fill up on gas • No need to replace timing belt • No need to sync throttle and idle speed •

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ride experience is at the heart of our design process.  As passionate motorcycle riders, we set out to make a motorbike that we were excited to ride.  

Full ""tank"" every day. No expensive charge station required. A simple 220/110 V household outlet satisfies all the needs of the ECR's  2200W on-board charger. Every outlet is now a “fueling” station.  
When slowing down or stopping, you can use the Regenerative Braking System which converts kinetic energy into electrical energy – feeding it back into the battery pack, enhancing both the range and the ride time.   
Denzel ECR is also equipped with an analogue brake that helps to extend the brake pad’s life-span on long downhill runs.
A few advantages of the DENZEL ECR V1 compared to petroleum motorcycles: 
• Zero pollution • Lightweight • No smell • Virtually no maintenance • No kick-starting • 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We've worked day and night for the past two years to build what fans are calling the coolest and most affordable electric motorcycle in the world.

As motorcycle enthusiasts, we wanted the best and simply could not accept to hear the words it's not possible.  Many people have told us we couldn’t make a powerful electric motorcycle for under $5000. So – there you have it: we’re bringing our challenge to YOU for even less. They all said that the power will be too weak, the battery life would be too short and in the end it will look also ugly. All that negativity simply  motivated us to prove to all the ‘Doubters’ that it CAN be done, that we can build a stylish electric motorcycle at an incredible price. We began to brainstorm on how to achieve this. We needed ECR to be lightweight, modular, strong, streamlined and – most importantly – affordable.…And we finally found a way! 
 
We've built a number of prototypes that all turned out to be too expensive, so we started pondering how to reduce the cost of manufacturing without sacrificing the quality. The most effective way we found to be able to do this was to resource all the parts in bulk.
Why We Need Your Support
Electric motorbikes presently retail from between $7,500 – to $15,000+. We wanted retail a final product for under $5,000 and we are offering even better deals for our early supporters. 
 We're offering to build you electric motorcycle at the cost of production, so we aren't making money out of it. In return we need your support to raise money for certification and homologation to make ECR street legal. After certification is done ECR V1 will be retailed $5000 at the dealer shops.Crowd-funding enables us to keep the costs down as we can work together with factories  to produce the right amount of units, without dealing with high storage costs and other related overheads
… This is where we need your help as – with your support – when we reach our goal, DENZEL ECR V1 will become a reality – with you as a contributor being able to support the electric cafe racer  for the best possible price.
We want to raise the standard and give everyone the opportunity to enjoy the finer things. Don’t settle for second best. Go for more. Help us make this happen by being an early supporter.

We've self funded and thoroughly tested 4 fully functioning prototypes and are now focused on:  

Making final tweaks to designs
Finalizing quality control systems
Developing accessories 

The funds raised will be used for:

Mass production
 Homologation
Certification
Creating an international network of distributors and service stores

We've been working on ECR for over a year. Unlike many of the larger technology projects on Indiegogo, Igor and Alex have completely funded the project themselves. It's been a long road and they've given up everything to bring their dreams to the world. Your support will allow us to offer you a better electric motorcycle and prove that affordable electric transportation is a reality.
So why support us?

You'll be the first to ride the Electric Cafe Racer. 
You want to contribute to a greener future.

It's cool after all :)

Our Gyro-Force V2 technology is now smarter and more responsive to our lithium ion smart battery. The improvements we’ve made in the design of the Gyro-Force V2 has made it easier to swap batteries on the fly without wasting any of your precious time. Destined to be a massive game changer in the electric commuter industry, this is the Uno Bolt MINI.  The MINI was designed to go beyond its predecessor. Whether you're a student roaming around campus, an employee working in the city, or a tourist enjoying the scenic activities in the area, the MINI provides a fun, convenient and green way to travel.      We designed the grips to endure long-term use so we applied the best type of rubber grips the industry has to offer.   The footrest is strong enough to hold a tremendous load, yet foldable and light making storage of the MINI convenient and compact.    The Gyro-Force V2 Chip technology is our mainboard built in-house. The V2 is more responsive and can be calibrated for Cruising or Bolting modes.   The lower frame is made of solid steel and houses the Gyro-Force V2 chip. When activated, Night Riding mode lights up the frame with an array of shifting colors that glow through the Uno Bolt logo. The battery is located in the upper frame, which is made of a strong aluminum alloy.     The Cree LED headlight is bright enough to safely navigate any hour of the night.     We designed the rear taillight to serve two primary functions: Most importantly, the LED lights are more than bright enough to be seen by other drivers, but taillight also serves as a secondary battery display.    The LED screen displays your current speed, the battery life percentage, and a trip odometer. The speedometer will display either mph or km/h depending on the country to which is it being shipped.   We all know the toll a long ride can have on our backside, so we implemented a comfortable gel-foam seat, sure to make long trips more comfortable. Sleek and functional the underside of the seat has a handle making it easy to pick up and transport your MINI.   Our seat-post will accommodate nearly any bike seat fitting. So if you decide that our seat is not right for you, you will easily be able to swap it out for another.   The specific treading we chose for the tire aids in dispersing rain on pavement. Yes, the MINI can still be operated in rainy conditions!    Our tire lock system does away with any bulky stands to prevent the MINI from moving. Hidden right underneath the footrest, our tire lock system makes it easy to lock or unlock the tire in seconds.   Both our standard and long-range batteries are equipped with LG lithium-ion cells. The standard battery can get up to 15 miles per charge while the long-range battery can get up to 23 miles per charge. Furthermore, our smart batteries can be charged without the hassle of removing them from the MINI.  The MINI's top frame is secured with a built-in lock system. The only way to remove the battery is with a designated key. Each MINI will include two keys.       Cruise mode is designed for the casual rider, while Bolt mode is better suited for fast-paced riding.         The success of our first electric unicycle put the Uno Bolt into hands of people all over the world. The feedback we have received praising its portability and convenience has motivated us to go even further. We wanted to use what we learned on our first project to design a smaller, lighter, and more efficient Uno Bolt that could be used for individuals looking for a compact commuter vehicle. It was from this ambition that the MINI was born.         What IS the charger rated at?The MINI charger has an operating range of 100-240VAC, 50/60Hz, and covers most countries. Does the LED interface change from mph to km/h?The screen is dedicated so it will not change. We will ship the correct speedometer according to your country. What exactly is the universal seatpost?With the universal seatpost, you can swap out the seat that is included with the MINI. So if you already own or plan to purchase another saddle you can swap it out. The seat post bracket will accommodate any type of saddle. What kind of warranty is included?Each MINI is covered by a limited 1-year warranty. That includes the motor, frame, and battery.  Please note: this does not include damages incurred by rider usage. Any alteration, tampering or modification of the electronics, battery, controller, throttle, motor, circuitry or related electrical wiring will not be serviced or supported by Uno Bolt and will void the warranty. Will I be able to purchase replacement parts?After our first batch of shipments is sent out in December, we will be offering replacement parts through our website where you can purchase components, accessories, and another MINI. If I lose the keys can I reorder them from you?No two Uno Bolt keys are alike and we do not store back up keys. We strongly advise making spare ones in case you lose the two. Can I get a refund on my order once it's placed?Please read Inidiegogo's policy located here. Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?We are not responsible for the additional taxes, fees, etc. Please contact your local authorities for any additional fees that could occur during shipment to your location. How do I become a dealer?We are open to retailers worldwide. If you have a retail store where the MINI would be a good addition to your stock, inquire by emailing us at theunobolt@gmail.com We will be adding more questions and answers in the days to come. If you would like a quicker reply to your questions please contact us through our Facebook,  our website comment section or email at theunobolt@gmail.com  We have crowdfunded our first Uno Bolt in the past and we reached delivery time earlier than expected. We expect to do the same this time around and we have our team ready to go.

Αn electrο-solar vehicle (category L5e) that uses a large rotating photovoltaic generator and powerful motors, to carry three passengers and their luggage with an extended driving range. It moves with electricity, which is stored in a lithium battery that can charge from the sun, the grid or from passengers, when they pedal. In normal conditions, the three energy sources, solar, battery and muscle power, contribute symmetrically. This synergy makes SUNNYCLIST the most economic, environmental and autonomous vehicle ever built.</span><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><b>We envisioned an autonomous vehicle that produces its energy consumption.</b> By exploiting the sun and making passengers active in its motion, we reinvent automobility and propose  an alternative commute mode. Humanity has to face tough challenges in the field of air quality, environmental protection and job preservation. We work tirelessly to make our world a little better. </p>
<p><b>We are young entrepreneurs</b> striving to make a difference in <b>sunny  Greece</b>, seeking alternative ways to evolve and create new jobs. We are inspired by the environment, nature, sun and man. We discover practical and functional solutions. We think out of the box, respect people and focus on environmental and economic sustainability.</p>
<p><b>Our Impact Together...<i style=""font-style: italic;""> </i></b>By supporting us you give us the opportunity to put our product into mass production and let more people discover our solution. Since we already have a well tested working prototype, we need your support, to make Sunnyclist truly great, to scale up and offer a new opportunity for all people to live greener and smarter. You will also help humanity reach its goals of climate control and at the same time you become a part of our effort to uphold the productive side of Greece, in the most creative way.</p>

<h2>Working for an uncompromised design!</h2>
<p>We are working on an uncompromised state-of-the-art design for the final production vehicle, which is going to be based on the existing thoroughly tested chassis. We keep working on further development in terms of optimal engineering and design aesthetics and human factors, a process that will be finalized before final production and will be incorporated into the final vehicles to be delivered.</p>
<p><b>On Sunnyclist the function dictates the design</b></p>
<p>One of the big challenges we are facing while designing Sunnyclist, is to harmonically incorporate the large solar roof to a light vehicle body underneath. We decided to keep the photovoltaic area as large as possible for maximum efficiency and range and this is also the main reason for choosing a flat solar panel surface. We deliberately created Sunnyclist to be a three wheeler for lower friction, weight, complexity and cost.</p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><h1>Use of funds</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Since its inception, Sunnyclist is a self funded project with many reproductions of the prototype being built and market tested. 
Your contribution to this campaign will allow us to finalize the design and make Sunnyclist the best vehicle possible. We will also purchase raw materials, source components, open molds, develop the App, begin production and legally certify the vehicle for street use.We need your support to scale up the production and achieve the best quality at the lowest price. We have initiated a low scale pilot scheme on where we make our prototypes, so we do not need to invest so much on the facilities. For production we will be able to to scale up to the capacity of 1000 vehicles/year and all methods of production will be handmade. Owner of our manufacturing facility is Andreas Pitsoulis, a high-end machine craftsman. </p>
<p>Use of funds will differe according to the available amount. This depends also from the kind of Perks that you choose, but here is an estimation of how we will use them. If we meet our goal we will be able to procceed to the<b> licencing</b> of the Sunnyclist for<b> street usage for all the E.U</b>. If we surpass our target and can raise more money we will be able to further develop the Sunnyclist and the production line. We will offer optional upgrades to the Sunnyclist that may include additional color options, front led lights, an edition of the Sunnyclist with steering wheel, different seat options, an alternative exterior styling and much more. So, The more we raise, the more fun and exciting the brand new Sunnyclist becomes! </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we do not meet the goal we will initiate the production of the Sunnyclist, but not for street usage. </span></p>
<h1>Risks and challenges</h1>
<p>Manufacturing: We have been preparing this project for about four years. We realize your contribution to pre-purchase a Sunnyclist through this campaign is a significant investment, and we do not take that lightly.  We are confident that we can bring the Sunnyclist to life, and have made the necessary accommodations to ensure this product will be delivered, but we need your help to get it there. We don't anticipate running into any major engineering challenges, as we've already addressed them developing our current prototype. We are sure we will encounter some bumps on the road, but we feel confident that we can overcome them. All that remains is tidying up a few rough edges to make a finished product. We already have the designers and engineers on board to take care of that, and it's almost ready to go!</p>
<p>Then we will hire some employees for the actual fabrication and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Fulfillment: We have teamed up with an organized logistics company that will secure accurate and fast delivery to our backers.</p>
<p>Financial management: Due to the instability of the Greek banking system and in order to ensure the uninterrupted financial management of this project, all transactions will be carried out through a Swedish bank and pay pal.</p>
<br/><h1>Manufacturing &amp; Timeline</h1>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our goal is to deliver the best product possible.  We are working on stress and durability testing, as also on crash test simulation,  to ensure a quality product. Initial Sunnyclist production will be made and assembled at our production facility located in Crete.  This allows us to personally inspect each component and test before delivering. However the capacity is not suited for mass quantity and we will be able to produce 10 vehicles per month. Should we receive a large volume of orders, we do have a contingency plan in place with strategic production connections in Europe.  </span></p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>We are working hard to deliver product for Summer 2016.  </p></span><h1>

<h4></h4>
<p><b>The Sunnyclist is just for sunny places or for summertime, right? </b></p>
<p>Absolutely not! <br/>
Indeed, the Sunnyclist is very much at home in sunny environments, but it
functions just as well with less sunshine. The only difference will be the
reduced, costless, effortless energy, collected for use. The performance will
be the same, whilst still maintaining a significant advantage against
conventional electric vehicles. The efficiency shown in this presentation is
based on places like southern Europe, with typical direct irradiation of about
1600 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>. In your area the solar performance may be higher or
lower. <br/>
This map helps you estimate the solar driving range in your area.</p>

<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446826735/oj7ieeutpfs8v524cgmj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>So how do I use it, should I have a sunny parking?</b></p>
<p>As stated previously the more sun you have the increase in performance and fun. Nevertheless you can use the Sunnyclist like a common electric vehicle and charge it from a simple household outlet in less than three hours. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b></b></span></p>
<p><b>How does the Sunnyclist performs during the year?</b></p>
<p>The next diagram shows the monthly distribution of the daily solar driving range. The data refers to places like south Europe (normal direct irradiation about 1600 kWh/m2). In more sunny places the monthly distribution is even, the opposite happens in less sunny places. <br/></p>

<p><b>Is the Sunnyclist safe?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! That's one of our main goals with this vehicle. Tree-wheelers need extra care to avoid a roll-over. The Sunnyclist with a low center of gravity, near the rear axle and an evenly distributed load on the wheels, it has excellent traction and cornering stability</p>
<p>The Sunnyclist is also equipped with three-point seatbelts for all passengers.</p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Do I need a special license to operate a Sunnyclist ?</b></span><br/></p>
<p> Sunnyclist is an “Electric Three Wheeler”. For the EU (classified as Le5) you need a car or a motorbike driving license. For the rest of the world each country, state and city has its own laws and restrictions. Please review your local motor vehicle rules and laws. Please note that we will be able to release  Sunnyclist for street use, only if we achieve our goal.</p>
<p><b>I want to pledge for a Sunnyclist for street use. What if you do not achieve your goal? </b></p>
<p>If we do not meet the goal we will initiate the production of the Sunnyclist, but not for street usage. So you can request a refund before the camapaign ends. However even after the campaign ends we will refund the 85% of the amount.<br/></p>
<p><b>I really want Sunnyclist! Can I by one anyway?</b></p>
<p>Yes, if you don't need it for street use there is no problem. The vehicle will be CE marked. However we can't guarantee it will be street-legal in your country. Each country has a different set of regulations concerning motorcycles and three wheelers. Unfortunately, it's not within our resources right now to research and comply with every regulation in every country, or offer different models for each region. However, if such regulations are simple, like ""cannot exceed 50 kph"", then we can definitely customize your Sunnyclist to comply. </p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What If the battery runs out ? Does it go only by the sun or the pedals.</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>The traction of the Sunnyclist is based on the battery that stores electricity from wherever it comes, the sun, the pedal or the network and feeds <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">the motors </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">with as much power as they need. If the battery runs out then the vehicle will only move with the power that can provide that moment as the PV generator (max 680W) and the passengers (about 700W). This means around 1,4 kW maximum power with the sun and passengers together. This power is only enough to propel the vehicle on an even road at a speed of 20km/h. If uphill,  his power is not enough. </span>Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to move the vehicle with an exhausted battery and is strongly not recommended, except for emergency, to move to the nearest outlet or a sunnier place. Therefore if the battery runs out you should wait for the vehicle to charge from the sun were it will gather enough energy or to charge from an outlet.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>What
about vehicle maintenance?</b></p>
<p>The
Sunnyclist requires minimal maintenance. There is no need for water or oil. The
materials that wear down are tyres, brake pads and shock absorbers which are
common in the market place and their replacement can be done by the technician
of the neighborhood. Similarly bicycle parts can be found in a common bike
store. If you need replacement or maintenance of a specialised component you
can contact us to send it to you and give you technical support for repair.</p>
<p><b>Why
solar roof is flat, would it be more beautiful if it was curved?</b></p>
<p>Two
of the key design principles of Sunnyclist is the efficiency and the economy.
Photovoltaic cells have maximum performance when all have the same orientation ie
when the solar roof is flat. If the solar roof was curved it would dramatically
lower performance and increase manufacturing cost. This is why the Sunnyclist
has a much better performance than other solar vehicles were unable to escape
from the stereotypes of automotive design.</p>

Drive smart - Go solar!






Autoevolution:  Looking at vehicles like the Sunnyclist here, you get the feeling humanity isn’t done yet with finding new ways of combining sources of power to provide that all-important forward thrust.
Engadget: You can leave this electric vehicle under the sun or use it as your gym to harness energy
Gizmag: At first glance the Sunnyclist looks like a typical electric tricycle, yet the combination of a solar panel on the roof with pedals for the passengers ensures that its battery can go a long way without requiring an external power supply.

Be bright - Green your city!

Sunnyclist represents an attractive and affordable solution of modern people for green mobility, with minimal costs, autonomy, no environmental pollution and without infrastructure commitments. Αn electrο-solar vehicle (category L5e) that uses a large rotating photovoltaic generator and powerful motors, to carry three passengers and their luggage with an extended driving range. It moves with electricity, which is stored in a lithium battery that can charge from the sun, the grid or from passengers, when they pedal. In normal conditions, the three energy sources, solar, battery and muscle power, contribute symmetrically. This synergy makes SUNNYCLIST the most economic, environmental and autonomous vehicle ever built.


We envisioned an autonomous vehicle that produces its energy consumption. By exploiting the sun and making passengers active in its motion, we reinvent automobility and propose  an alternative commute mode. Humanity has to face tough challenges in the field of air quality, environmental protection and job preservation. We work tirelessly to make our world a little better. 
We are young entrepreneurs striving to make a difference in sunny  Greece, seeking alternative ways to evolve and create new jobs. We are inspired by the environment, nature, sun and man. We discover practical and functional solutions. We think out of the box, respect people and focus on environmental and economic sustainability.
Our Impact Together... By supporting us you give us the opportunity to put our product into mass production and let more people discover our solution. Since we already have a well tested working prototype, we need your support, to make Sunnyclist truly great, to scale up and offer a new opportunity for all people to live greener and smarter. You will also help humanity reach its goals of climate control and at the same time you become a part of our effort to uphold the productive side of Greece, in the most creative way.






How Sunnyclist was born
At the beginning there were only thoughts…   
The environmental and energy problems have increased so much in our days, that we have come to a dead end and the technological solutions are no longer enough. A change in the consumer’s lifestyle is required.
Since 2011 we have been working continuously in order to constantly improve the quality of our solution.

.......with many reproductions of the prototype being built and market tested. 





Working for an uncompromised design!
We are working on an uncompromised state-of-the-art design for the final production vehicle, which is going to be based on the existing thoroughly tested chassis. We keep working on further development in terms of optimal engineering and design aesthetics and human factors, a process that will be finalized before final production and will be incorporated into the final vehicles to be delivered.
On Sunnyclist the function dictates the design
One of the big challenges we are facing while designing Sunnyclist, is to harmonically incorporate the large solar roof to a light vehicle body underneath. We decided to keep the photovoltaic area as large as possible for maximum efficiency and range and this is also the main reason for choosing a flat solar panel surface. We deliberately created Sunnyclist to be a three wheeler for lower friction, weight, complexity and cost.

Use of funds

Since its inception, Sunnyclist is a self funded project with many reproductions of the prototype being built and market tested. 
Your contribution to this campaign will allow us to finalize the design and make Sunnyclist the best vehicle possible. We will also purchase raw materials, source components, open molds, develop the App, begin production and legally certify the vehicle for street use.We need your support to scale up the production and achieve the best quality at the lowest price. We have initiated a low scale pilot scheme on where we make our prototypes, so we do not need to invest so much on the facilities. For production we will be able to to scale up to the capacity of 1000 vehicles/year and all methods of production will be handmade. Owner of our manufacturing facility is Andreas Pitsoulis, a high-end machine craftsman. 
Use of funds will differe according to the available amount. This depends also from the kind of Perks that you choose, but here is an estimation of how we will use them. If we meet our goal we will be able to procceed to the licencing of the Sunnyclist for street usage for all the E.U. If we surpass our target and can raise more money we will be able to further develop the Sunnyclist and the production line. We will offer optional upgrades to the Sunnyclist that may include additional color options, front led lights, an edition of the Sunnyclist with steering wheel, different seat options, an alternative exterior styling and much more. So, The more we raise, the more fun and exciting the brand new Sunnyclist becomes! 


If we do not meet the goal we will initiate the production of the Sunnyclist, but not for street usage. 
Risks and challenges
Manufacturing: We have been preparing this project for about four years. We realize your contribution to pre-purchase a Sunnyclist through this campaign is a significant investment, and we do not take that lightly.  We are confident that we can bring the Sunnyclist to life, and have made the necessary accommodations to ensure this product will be delivered, but we need your help to get it there. We don't anticipate running into any major engineering challenges, as we've already addressed them developing our current prototype. We are sure we will encounter some bumps on the road, but we feel confident that we can overcome them. All that remains is tidying up a few rough edges to make a finished product. We already have the designers and engineers on board to take care of that, and it's almost ready to go!
Then we will hire some employees for the actual fabrication and manufacturing.
Fulfillment: We have teamed up with an organized logistics company that will secure accurate and fast delivery to our backers.
Financial management: Due to the instability of the Greek banking system and in order to ensure the uninterrupted financial management of this project, all transactions will be carried out through a Swedish bank and pay pal.
Manufacturing & Timeline
Our goal is to deliver the best product possible.  We are working on stress and durability testing, as also on crash test simulation,  to ensure a quality product. Initial Sunnyclist production will be made and assembled at our production facility located in Crete.  This allows us to personally inspect each component and test before delivering. However the capacity is not suited for mass quantity and we will be able to produce 10 vehicles per month. Should we receive a large volume of orders, we do have a contingency plan in place with strategic production connections in Europe.  
We are working hard to deliver product for Summer 2016.  






What's next?



Since the conception of Sunnyclist, we feel that we are opening a new field to create enormous opportunities. We are creating a fertile field for creative development, to try new ideas, new designs, new materials and innovative technologies. It is also a new field to try as people live differently and adopt new sustainable habits. But all that will only happen through your support and then we will have a bright future!

Technology
The whole concept is based on simple yet fundamental scientific principles. Through simplicity but also extensive study, the Sunnyclist exceedingly exploits both solar and human energy thus opening new horizons in sustainable mobility.


Light and firm aluminum frame
Low center of gravity near the rear axis providing maximum safety.
Use of the most efficient photovoltaic cells of hybrid technology in the market    ( 22,5% performance).

Solar charger with MPPT technology (maximum power point tracking)
High quality, light and efficient powertrain
Rotatable solar roof to face the sun while in parking position.
Regenerative Brake
Brushless in wheel DC motor of high efficiency (90%).
Lithium Batteries

Energy managment system


Did you know?


The Sunnyclist has been running challenges with great success, as the round of Crete covering 800km in 5 days


The Sunnyclist is an award-wining project on cleantech European competitions 

The Energy produced by solar and human power is more valuable from the energy stored in the battery
The sunnyclist has higher power density than a common electric vehicle: The power density of a solar generator, for most populated places globally, can reach up to 125wh/kg while a LiFePO4 battery pack used in most electric vehicles has a power density of 80 wh/kg and a lead battery pack used in golf carts has a power density of 30wh/kg.
The Sunnyclist features longer life time: Lithium batteries which are used in BEV have a life expectancy of about 10 years, while solar cells last more than 20 years.  In addition the solar generator ensures smaller charging cycles of the vehicle’s battery, thus extending its lifetime.

FAQ



The Sunnyclist is just for sunny places or for summertime, right? 
Absolutely not! 
Indeed, the Sunnyclist is very much at home in sunny environments, but it
functions just as well with less sunshine. The only difference will be the
reduced, costless, effortless energy, collected for use. The performance will
be the same, whilst still maintaining a significant advantage against
conventional electric vehicles. The efficiency shown in this presentation is
based on places like southern Europe, with typical direct irradiation of about
1600 kWh/m2. In your area the solar performance may be higher or
lower. 
This map helps you estimate the solar driving range in your area.





So how do I use it, should I have a sunny parking?
As stated previously the more sun you have the increase in performance and fun. Nevertheless you can use the Sunnyclist like a common electric vehicle and charge it from a simple household outlet in less than three hours. 


How does the Sunnyclist performs during the year?
The next diagram shows the monthly distribution of the daily solar driving range. The data refers to places like south Europe (normal direct irradiation about 1600 kWh/m2). In more sunny places the monthly distribution is even, the opposite happens in less sunny places. 

Is the Sunnyclist safe?
Absolutely! That's one of our main goals with this vehicle. Tree-wheelers need extra care to avoid a roll-over. The Sunnyclist with a low center of gravity, near the rear axle and an evenly distributed load on the wheels, it has excellent traction and cornering stability
The Sunnyclist is also equipped with three-point seatbelts for all passengers.



Do I need a special license to operate a Sunnyclist ?
 Sunnyclist is an “Electric Three Wheeler”. For the EU (classified as Le5) you need a car or a motorbike driving license. For the rest of the world each country, state and city has its own laws and restrictions. Please review your local motor vehicle rules and laws. Please note that we will be able to release  Sunnyclist for street use, only if we achieve our goal.
I want to pledge for a Sunnyclist for street use. What if you do not achieve your goal? 
If we do not meet the goal we will initiate the production of the Sunnyclist, but not for street usage. So you can request a refund before the camapaign ends. However even after the campaign ends we will refund the 85% of the amount.
I really want Sunnyclist! Can I by one anyway?
Yes, if you don't need it for street use there is no problem. The vehicle will be CE marked. However we can't guarantee it will be street-legal in your country. Each country has a different set of regulations concerning motorcycles and three wheelers. Unfortunately, it's not within our resources right now to research and comply with every regulation in every country, or offer different models for each region. However, if such regulations are simple, like ""cannot exceed 50 kph"", then we can definitely customize your Sunnyclist to comply. 
What If the battery runs out ? Does it go only by the sun or the pedals.


The traction of the Sunnyclist is based on the battery that stores electricity from wherever it comes, the sun, the pedal or the network and feeds  the motors with as much power as they need. If the battery runs out then the vehicle will only move with the power that can provide that moment as the PV generator (max 680W) and the passengers (about 700W). This means around 1,4 kW maximum power with the sun and passengers together. This power is only enough to propel the vehicle on an even road at a speed of 20km/h. If uphill,  his power is not enough. Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to move the vehicle with an exhausted battery and is strongly not recommended, except for emergency, to move to the nearest outlet or a sunnier place. Therefore if the battery runs out you should wait for the vehicle to charge from the sun were it will gather enough energy or to charge from an outlet.





What
about vehicle maintenance?
The
Sunnyclist requires minimal maintenance. There is no need for water or oil. The
materials that wear down are tyres, brake pads and shock absorbers which are
common in the market place and their replacement can be done by the technician
of the neighborhood. Similarly bicycle parts can be found in a common bike
store. If you need replacement or maintenance of a specialised component you
can contact us to send it to you and give you technical support for repair.
Why
solar roof is flat, would it be more beautiful if it was curved?
Two
of the key design principles of Sunnyclist is the efficiency and the economy.
Photovoltaic cells have maximum performance when all have the same orientation ie
when the solar roof is flat. If the solar roof was curved it would dramatically
lower performance and increase manufacturing cost. This is why the Sunnyclist
has a much better performance than other solar vehicles were unable to escape
from the stereotypes of automotive design.




How long does it take to charge the battery?

We are offering 120V, 220V, and 240V charging adapters. We will be sending an email to all our backers at the end of the campaign with a survey to gather you shipping address, desired eBike color, and charger preference. 

Do I need to pedal it to operate it?
No, on the Sunnyclist the pedals are optional and portable. 

Does the Sunnyclist have a line of accessories?

We are planning to launch along with the Sunnyclist, a line of accessories that add to the users experience which include, LED lighting, speakers, case/cover, seats, Luggage rack, etc.

Some of these include:</strong></p><p><i><u>1. Reduce emissions</u></i></p><p>The EV (electric vehicle) produces no emissions, so no toxic fumes which are especially hazardous to human health in places like tunnels, enclosed car parks, around schools, shopping centres, busy intersections, and so on.</p><p>When you charge your EV from the mains power grid, you will create emissions at the power station, depending on the generation technology in use, but greenhouse gases will generally be lower than if petrol (or diesel) is burnt in the vehicle itself. Charging EVs overnight from off-peak power can significantly reduce their impact on the environment, and bringing renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, on-line improves the EV's environmental impact.</p><p><i><u>2. Low Running Costs</u></i></p><p>An EV is much cheaper to run than its petrol counterpart. Typically in Australia we would expect an electricity cost of 1 to 2 cents per kilometre to run an EV. Compare that to the fuel cost of your current car. Furthermore, since there is very little to service and maintain in the electric system, the cost of servicing and maintenance is negligible.</p><p><i><u>3. Economic Benefits</u></i></p><p>Cheaper motoring is nice for the individual, but reducing our dependence on imported fuels is a benefit for the national economy as a whole. Our expenditure on imported oil mostly creates offshore profits for foreign or multinational corporations, rather than circulating through our own economy and benefiting our community.</p><p><i><u>4. Excellent Performance</u></i></p><p>Contrary to some misguided reports, electric cars have excellent performance, and can be great fun to drive. They deliver power where you need it - at low RPM, so you get great acceleration, and excellent top speed as well.</p><p><strong>2-TUNING </strong></p><p>We will be one of the big names among the refiners of exclusive cars.

Or you care about Mother Nature because it’s so damaged by CO2? Worry no more, because WE ARE HERE to make your car 100% electric .­A majority of the electric cars on the road today are ""home brew"" conversion vehicles. People with an interest in electric cars convert existing gasoline-powered car­s to electric in their backyards and garages. There are many Web sites that talk about the phenomenon and show you how to do it, where to get parts, but you cant make a Perfect and powerful Electric car .Gasoline-powered cars. They are perhaps the most inefficient device that many of us use daily. We really should all be driving electric vehicles The internal combustion engine is inefficient in term of pollution, gas costs and maintenance costs. But, as you may have heard, there are no electric vehicles available today that resemble conventional cars or trucks. Companies like Phoenix Motorcars, Tesla Motors, Commuter Cars and Miles Automotive Group and ZAP are coming close, but you still can't plunk down some cash and buy an electric car from them today. The only type of electric cars that can be purchased are NEVs (Neighbor Electric Vehicles), which usually have a top speed of about 25 MPH. But wait – NOW WE ARE HERE. We studied All The Best Electric cars and we make connection to get the best people to Make Your cars Electric and Super Powerful Like a Tesla or a BMW i8There are a lot of good reasons to convert your car from petrol to electric power. Some of these include:1. Reduce emissionsThe EV (electric vehicle) produces no emissions, so no toxic fumes which are especially hazardous to human health in places like tunnels, enclosed car parks, around schools, shopping centres, busy intersections, and so on.When you charge your EV from the mains power grid, you will create emissions at the power station, depending on the generation technology in use, but greenhouse gases will generally be lower than if petrol (or diesel) is burnt in the vehicle itself. Charging EVs overnight from off-peak power can significantly reduce their impact on the environment, and bringing renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, on-line improves the EV's environmental impact.2. Low Running CostsAn EV is much cheaper to run than its petrol counterpart. Typically in Australia we would expect an electricity cost of 1 to 2 cents per kilometre to run an EV. Compare that to the fuel cost of your current car. Furthermore, since there is very little to service and maintain in the electric system, the cost of servicing and maintenance is negligible.3. Economic BenefitsCheaper motoring is nice for the individual, but reducing our dependence on imported fuels is a benefit for the national economy as a whole. Our expenditure on imported oil mostly creates offshore profits for foreign or multinational corporations, rather than circulating through our own economy and benefiting our community.4. Excellent PerformanceContrary to some misguided reports, electric cars have excellent performance, and can be great fun to drive. They deliver power where you need it - at low RPM, so you get great acceleration, and excellent top speed as well.2-TUNING We will be one of the big names among the refiners of exclusive cars. Equipped with intelligent functionality, convincing technology, and captivating aesthetics, they trigger admiration wherever they appear: on race tracks, streets, or car parks. Worldwide.today and in the future. We will put our know-how into the product development and car aesthetics.

We use carbon fiber as the primary material in the frame, making it both extremely light and very durable.

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>     We’ve been developing the Impossible Bike for more than 3 years, so we are confident about our procurement strategy and production capacity. We have spent months in negotiations with various manufacturers, we just need the capital to pay the manufacturer.</p>
<p>This past year, we dedicated ourselves to mastering the development of our Impossible Bike's weight and fold technology, while designing the smartest road companion ever.</p>
<p>As we are gearing up to the final stages of our development and heading to mass production, we want to include you in the last chapter of this adventure to make sure we are truly designing the bike you all have been waiting for.</p>

Impossible Technology started as a team of engineers and software designers in a dorm room and has only grown from there. Our current team has come together from all parts of the globe in pursuit of one goal: the creation of the world’s most compact foldable electric bike. When we first began to design Impossible, we felt that Impossible needed to be more than just a folding bicycle. It needed to be compact enough to fit inside a backpack and lightweight enough to be easily transported anywhere. Creating a bike designed to be both incredibly light and yet durable has been no easy task.""The first smart e-bike that can fit in your backpack""     Impossible Bike: the world’s first foldable e-bike combining portability with ingenuity. Using groundbreaking technology to fold the bike into a smaller portable unit while maintaining structural integrity, Impossible bike transforms the typical function of an electric bike into the most advanced vehicle of multimodal transportation.Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:     When we began to design the Impossible bike, we felt it needed to be more than just a folding bicycle. It needed to be compact enough to fit inside a backpack and light enough to carry anywhere. Creating a bike designed to be both incredibly light and incredibly durable has been no easy task.     Impossible Bike technology evolves from the fundamental physics of transportation, the wheel, through combining a circular carbon fiber frame, with a circular retractable wheel, to a circular ultra-thin motor. With its futuristic frame and wheels, powered by the thinnest motor and lightest battery, Impossible Bike is designed to be agile and fully adaptable to your lifestyle and can travel up to 30 km on a single charge.     We developed a frame built to last: a frame built around circles instead of a single horizontal girder. The circular design helps to ensure that the bike spreads the weight equally across the frame. We placed the seat and handle bars at similar heights so that the front and rear wheels bear the weight of the rider equally. We use carbon fiber as the primary material in the frame, making it both extremely light and very durable. The “connecting box” in the middle of the frame is one of the handfuls of pieces made of heavier steel. This steel box can easily hold the rider and withstand the shocks associated with everyday use. In its current incarnation, Impossible can carry up to 100 kilograms/220pounds.     Protected from rust by ultra-weather resistant carbon fiber, Impossible Bike can accompany you anyway, anywhere, anytime.  We went further to protect and save space, we have combined the function of riding saddle and carrying case. While folded, the NeverWet-coated carrying case keeps Impossible and its charger clean and ready for use no matter where you store it. Even on rainy days, backers can enjoy a safe and comfortable ride.     An innovative take on bike technology, Impossible Bike portability focus does not mean compromising on durability: the frame boasts thick high-strength steel grade attachments and bearings inspired by automotive engineering.     One of our main challenges was choosing an electric motor that would fit our parameters in terms of both power and weight. The Impossible bike when fully funded will feature a brushless DC motor completely designed by Impossible Technology.      The microcontroller chip is small, lightweight, and powerful. The chip connects the battery, the disc motor, and wireless receiver to the Impossible bike. The microcontroller chip is the primary component integrating the hardware and software. With the Bluetooth connectivity powered by the microcontroller, the Impossible bike can connect to any device. With ten 2900mah 10A 3.6V 44.5g batteries powered by the microcontroller, the Impossible bike can cruise at up to 12.5 mph for 60 minutes, or at normal speed for up to 15.6 miles.     Have al the data you need in the palm of your hand and all the security on your back: Impossible Backpack will automatically sync to your Impossible Bike's Bluetooth enabled microcontroller which is automatically synced to your smartphone.      Impossible Bike features a set of ultra-durable mechanical wheels that support daily use on even the most uneven terrain.

     Riding Impossible is a breeze. Navigate throughout the city easily, simply: unfold, pull, lock, and go. point the front wheel in the direction of travel and off you go — no pedaling necessary. You can choose any mode of transportation other than the Impossible Bike by simply collapsing the bike. 

     With enough support, we will also offer removable covers in our online store, available in a variety of colors. In its current form, around 40% of Impossible’s parts are customizable, such as the wheels and handlebars. We aim to make the other 60% similarly customizable. We plan to include even more accessories and designs in the future through our online store.       There are five models to choose from: BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE, and ORIGINAL. Impossible BLACK boasts a sleek smooth black frame, black wheels, and black handlebar inspired by the All-Black-Everything design, and will look incredibly stoic under all riders. However, for those who prefer more contrast, Impossible WHITE will offer the same features as Impossible BLACK, but in a more Tron-style. Impossible ORIGINAL takes on a minimalist design of maintaining the carbon fiber color. Impossible RED and Impossible BLUE can match your colorful headphones as your roll down the block.    Design






     The intuitive design of the Impossible Bike app user interface gives you easy access and readable bike data, as well as battery notifications, activity feed, and more.
     No need to worry about a bike lock: Impossible Bike can always be at your side wherever you go thanks to its unique physical design.
Impossible Bike Specs

Hidden Batteries 


     Impossible has a removable battery installed in the body frame that makes invisible so you can enjoy the slick and clean design. You can simply take it out and replace it with another pair. This makes impossible the best travel companion. You can take it with you in a car, train, boat and even an airplane.

Risks and challenges
     We’ve been developing the Impossible Bike for more than 3 years, so we are confident about our procurement strategy and production capacity. We have spent months in negotiations with various manufacturers, we just need the capital to pay the manufacturer.
This past year, we dedicated ourselves to mastering the development of our Impossible Bike's weight and fold technology, while designing the smartest road companion ever.
As we are gearing up to the final stages of our development and heading to mass production, we want to include you in the last chapter of this adventure to make sure we are truly designing the bike you all have been waiting for.
When you back this project, you are taking a journey with us. Therefore, your experience and insight are important to us and we will be listening to your feedback and trying our best to integrate them into the Impossible Bike.",30.0,3,"1 Campaign

A Captain and a Pilot. Both come to you. The Pilot drives you home in your car, and the Captain follows.</p><p><strong>Ferry </strong>[fer-ee]</p><p>Verb</p><p>To carry or convey back and forth over a fixed route in a boat or plane</p><p>Before you get your hopes up, we only “carry and convey” in cars. Yours, to be specific. How awesome is that?</p><p> </p><h3>How it works</h3><ol>
<li>You download the rider app and provide info about yourself and your car.</li>
<li>Once you order a ride, a TwoFerry team comes and picks you up. Essentially, it’s a cab with 2 drivers. We call them Captains and Pilots.</li>
<li>The Pilot will get out, confirm some information and then drive you home in your own vehicle, while the Captain follows behind.</li>
</ol><p>That’s it! We will provide an easy and convenient way to reduce intoxicated drivers while getting you and car home at the same time and in one trip. It’s a win-win!</p><p> </p><h3>How it started</h3><p>About 10 years ago, I had this crazy idea to buy a gas-powered, collapsible scooter and bring people home from the bar in their own car. I’d fold my scooter up and put it in their trunk, get them home safe, and then scoot myself back into town and do it all over again.</p><p>I never got further than buying the scooter. At the time I was young, inexperienced, short on cash and lacking a business mentor.</p><p>I'm now old, somewhat experienced and still short on cash, but I believe in this concept so deeply, that I recently left my cozy job in corporate America to commit to this business full time. More on that below, but first, check out this awesome video:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkPqzN2j10Q?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><h3>As I was saying</h3><p>I’m looking for operating capital to ensure that we are able to expand TwoFerry into other cities sooner than later. Also, by donating through Indiegogo, I will be able to see where there are concentrated areas of interest for this app which will help dictate our growth plan and prioritize where we will go after Salt Lake City.</p><p>For your investment, we will give you “free” rides (and/or swag) based on the amount donated. Once the app has launched, we will put credits into your TwoFerry account on the app so you can redeem your rides at your leisure.</p><p>If we don’t meet the full fundraising goal, all the money raised will still be put into the business as the app is already in development!</p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Here’s a sobering stat: 10,000 people die in the US EVERY YEAR from alcohol -<br/>related accidents. We all think it can’t happen to us, but we think you’re pretty cool<br/>and would hate to see anything happen to you (or for you to have to live with<br/>causing harm to another.)</li>
<li>We will also save potential impaired drivers a ton of cash. The average cost of a DUI<br/>is over $10K dollars. We’d like to put most of that back in your pocket (and just a<br/>little bit in ours.) Win/Win!</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Apart from solving the annoyance of the “morning after car retrieval,” the higher purpose is to reduce the amount of alcohol related accidents and DUI arrests that this scenario causes. I firmly believe that people would make better choices and not drive buzzed or drunk if they could just get their car home with them safely and easily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way – bars, restaurants, and people who want to find a good parking space also benefit from TwoFerry.</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><ul>
<li>The main risk is if one of the “big guys” launch a similar concept inside of their existing robust infrastructure.</li>
<li>Our customers could have hoopties that nobody wants to drive.</li>
<li>There is a lot of regulation popping up around the ride share concept in certain states that will make it harder to enter those markets.</li>
<li>Drunk people are annoying, and it may be hard to find drivers willing to put up with that sh...stuff.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>There are so many ways we can help each other. Obviously, our donation offers are pretty one-sided, you get so much more than you give. However, we know that not everyone has extra cash lying around to give to a crowdfunded rideshare app. Luckily, your honest feedback is just as valuable! Take a moment to fill out this super brief survey: <a href=""https://forms.gle/4ngToELdocmJZuLx6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://forms.gle/4ngToELdocmJZuLx6</a></p><p>Lastly, it takes a village... I’d be forever grateful if you could share this fundraiser with your friends, family, and professional network and follow TwoFerry on social media. </p><p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping me make this dream a reality!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Tiff</p><p>#nocarleftbehind #responsiblyirresponsible #driven #womanowned #twoferry</p><ul>

</ul></div>","What is TwoFerry?Let’s break it down, dictionary style:Two [too] NounA cardinal number, 1 plus 1In our case, it’s two people. A Captain and a Pilot. Both come to you. The Pilot drives you home in your car, and the Captain follows.Ferry [fer-ee]VerbTo carry or convey back and forth over a fixed route in a boat or planeBefore you get your hopes up, we only “carry and convey” in cars. Yours, to be specific. How awesome is that? How it works
You download the rider app and provide info about yourself and your car.
Once you order a ride, a TwoFerry team comes and picks you up. Essentially, it’s a cab with 2 drivers. We call them Captains and Pilots.
The Pilot will get out, confirm some information and then drive you home in your own vehicle, while the Captain follows behind.
That’s it! We will provide an easy and convenient way to reduce intoxicated drivers while getting you and car home at the same time and in one trip. It’s a win-win! How it startedAbout 10 years ago, I had this crazy idea to buy a gas-powered, collapsible scooter and bring people home from the bar in their own car. I’d fold my scooter up and put it in their trunk, get them home safe, and then scoot myself back into town and do it all over again.I never got further than buying the scooter. At the time I was young, inexperienced, short on cash and lacking a business mentor.I'm now old, somewhat experienced and still short on cash, but I believe in this concept so deeply, that I recently left my cozy job in corporate America to commit to this business full time. More on that below, but first, check out this awesome video: As I was sayingI’m looking for operating capital to ensure that we are able to expand TwoFerry into other cities sooner than later. Also, by donating through Indiegogo, I will be able to see where there are concentrated areas of interest for this app which will help dictate our growth plan and prioritize where we will go after Salt Lake City.For your investment, we will give you “free” rides (and/or swag) based on the amount donated. Once the app has launched, we will put credits into your TwoFerry account on the app so you can redeem your rides at your leisure.If we don’t meet the full fundraising goal, all the money raised will still be put into the business as the app is already in development! The Impact
Here’s a sobering stat: 10,000 people die in the US EVERY YEAR from alcohol -related accidents. We all think it can’t happen to us, but we think you’re pretty cooland would hate to see anything happen to you (or for you to have to live withcausing harm to another.)
We will also save potential impaired drivers a ton of cash. The average cost of a DUIis over $10K dollars. We’d like to put most of that back in your pocket (and just alittle bit in ours.) Win/Win!
 Apart from solving the annoyance of the “morning after car retrieval,” the higher purpose is to reduce the amount of alcohol related accidents and DUI arrests that this scenario causes. I firmly believe that people would make better choices and not drive buzzed or drunk if they could just get their car home with them safely and easily.Oh, and by the way – bars, restaurants, and people who want to find a good parking space also benefit from TwoFerry. Risks & Challenges
The main risk is if one of the “big guys” launch a similar concept inside of their existing robust infrastructure.
Our customers could have hoopties that nobody wants to drive.
There is a lot of regulation popping up around the ride share concept in certain states that will make it harder to enter those markets.
Drunk people are annoying, and it may be hard to find drivers willing to put up with that sh...stuff.
 Other Ways You Can HelpThere are so many ways we can help each other. Obviously, our donation offers are pretty one-sided, you get so much more than you give. However, we know that not everyone has extra cash lying around to give to a crowdfunded rideshare app. Luckily, your honest feedback is just as valuable! Take a moment to fill out this super brief survey: https://forms.gle/4ngToELdocmJZuLx6Lastly, it takes a village... I’d be forever grateful if you could share this fundraiser with your friends, family, and professional network and follow TwoFerry on social media. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping me make this dream a reality!Sincerely,Tiff#nocarleftbehind #responsiblyirresponsible #driven #womanowned #twoferry

For as little as $25 you can help us construct our first prototype, be part of our development trials, and directly shape the future fleet. We'll be converting Juniper, and taking her up the east coast for “on and off” road testing. And with enough support, to the NT, South Australia, WA and on the ferry over to Tassie. The more we raise, the more cars we can build and the faster we’ll be able to get to your part of the country.Australia should lead the world in zero emissions transport. Help us prove that we love our country as much as we love cars and adventure. Meet Juniper, she’ll be the first Jaunt car - our prototype.  With your help we’ll transform her into an electric vehicle, built to explore Australia.Juniper is a 1971 Land Rover Series 2a and was used for years by a fisherman in southern  Queensland. She was then given a fresh coat of paint and spent the last 8 years as a daily commuter and weekend explorer around Gladstone.These old cars are wonderful… and terrible. They’re difficult to operate, they’re loud, the fumes get into the cabin and they chew through oil and fuel. Conversion to an electric drivetrain transforms them. It removes all the mechanical complexity (and unreliability), increases the capability but leaves all the charm.We want to see Juniper creating new memories with you over the next 50 years.  Australia is a place of incredible natural beauty with ancient rainforests and vast deserts, rugged mountain ranges and endless beaches. But the only practical way to reach many of these places, whether they’re remote or close to home, is with a car.SUVs and 4WDs, cars built for adventure, continue to dominate our cars sales, but they’re also one of the reasons our transport emissions are one of the worst in the world.We’ve always felt a little guilty exploring the pristine bush in a petrol or diesel 4WD. Electric vehicles are almost silent and have no exhaust emissions, allowing you to hear, and smell, the surroundings. Not the explosions of fossil fuels.We think this desire to get out of the city and explore, for four wheel drives even, can be a catalyst for transforming our relationship with vehicles into something with a positive environmental and social impact.So we’re up-cycling iconic four-wheel-drives into electric vehicles that’ll get you out into the bush using renewable energy. To start, we’ll be using Land Rovers, one of the cars that fuelled our spirit of adventure in the first place.Land Rovers like Juniper helped build our major infrastructure, they fought bushfires, they worked on almost every farm, they deployed around the globe with our armed forces and they brought aid to remote communities.  They’re so much fun to drive and they can drive anywhere. They built the most remote roads in the country and yet they still look good in the inner city.There are thousands of Land Rovers sitting on farms and in back sheds. For us, they’re the perfect candidate for an Australian electric vehicle as they have:
Aluminium body, which means they’ve not rusted.
Simple body on frame construction making them easy to work on.
Built to carry heavy loads, meaning we can install a lot of batteries.
Extensive parts network as many components remained unchanged for 50 years.
Still affordable to purchase and available nationwide.
Iconic, nostalgic shape, that inspires adventure
Eventually we’ll look at other car makes and models, choosing vehicles bespoke for locations.There are a number for collectors and suppliers of old Land Rovers around the country. Dragging them out of sheds and cutting away the blackberries that engulf them is a full time job. We visited with Land Rover Heaven near Goulburn, NSW who sources vehicles for people all over country.We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we travel and pay our respects to elders past and present. We acknowledge the sorrow of the stolen generations, the impacts of colonisation and recognise the resilience, strength and pride of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. We’re swapping the internal combustion engine for an electric motor that bolts straight to the existing gearbox.  We’ll remove all of the old parts that run off belts and vacuum pressure and replace them with modern components that run off battery power.Juniper will be our first prototype, but the technology underpinning her is tried and tested.  We’re not inventing a new motor or a new kind of battery, we’ll be using a combination of parts that’ve been put into hundreds of conversions around the world.A NetGain Hyper9 AC Electric Motor will spin the original drivetrain.  It puts out 100kw of power and 235Nm of torque from almost 0 rpm. Which means it feels amazing to drive, you don’t need to change gear and it has regenerative braking.  Lift your foot of the accelerator and it brings you to a stop.The most expensive part of any EV conversion is the battery pack.  We’ll be using five Tesla Model S battery packs to power Juniper. Eventually we’ll move to a battery configuration designed to fit the unique shape of the Land Rover chassis, but Tesla batteries allow us to get up and running quickly, taking advantage of some of the worlds best engineering.We’ll be doing a significant amount of design and engineering over the course of developing Juniper and subsequent prototypes.  We aim to produce an EV conversion kit that works across 40 years of Land Rovers. From motor mounts to digital displays on the dash it needs to be easy to build and easy to use, right from your very first drive.We’re not trying to replicate a 1960s agricultural driving experience, we’re trying to improve it. We’ll keep the styling and ‘feel’ of the original car, but make a number of changes that take away some of the hard work. Power steering, heating, auto-cancelling indicators were all things missing when they were new.  More than just adding comfort, installing them makes the vehicle safer and more approachable to drive.  Be part of our test drive program for as little as fifty dollars, rent Juniper for a day, a weekend, or a whole week. Prove that Australians want to drive electric vehicles and be one of the only people to take a Jaunt this year. Be part of development trials and test drive Juniper with our designers and engineers. Your feedback will directly shape the future fleet.  We’ll be conducting on and off road trials where you’ll be able experience the fun of a very unique electric vehicle first hand. Juniper will be fitted with rear seating so you can bring most of the family along.  Book a Jaunt for a day, a weekend, a week or longer.  Take Juniper to the beach, or the rainforests, the mountains, the desserts or just around town.  Enjoy complete freedom in one of the most unique cars on the road.Everyone who books a Jaunt for a day or longer receives a limited edition keyring and key to ‘Juniper’ to commemorate their status as the first to Jaunt.  In a ‘Founders Edition’ Land Rover Series Electric Vehicle. Three only available for private sale during the development of our national car-share fleet. Be one of the very few to own a Jaunt vehicle. Delivered in 2020* with latest developments in drivetrain, battery management and digital experience.

Used for marketing and promotion pre-delivery.Help us embrace our heritage, provide an exciting, curated way to experience regional Australia, treat our natural environment with respect and harness the talent and experience of our regional communities.With your help, we think everyone can experience regional Australia’s beautiful environment sustainably.  If we raise $50,000 we‘ll convert Juniper, and take her up the east coast for “on and off” road testing.  And with enough support, to the NT, South Australia, WA and on the ferry over to Tassie. The more we raise, the more cars we can build and the faster we’ll be able to get to your part of the country.Australia has one of the lowest adoption rates of EVs in the world, and one of the highest transport emissions per capita. Cars built for adventure and exploration still dominate our new car sales. 10 out of the top 15 selling cars are utes or SUVs.We believe the desire to get out of the city, to explore, for four-wheel drives even,  can be a catalyst for transforming our relationship with vehicles into something that has a positive environmental and social impact.  Our mission is to encourage adventure and drive Australia toward zero emission transport.  We just want to be one small piece of Australia’s future transport puzzle, but a piece that sparks the imagination. Australia should lead the world in zero emissions transport. Not be one of the worst. Help us prove that we care about our country as much as we love cars and adventure.  Dave Budge - Co-founder & CEO Dave has combined emerging technology with beautiful design and meaningful storytelling for two decades, most recently as National Executive Director across Design, Creative and Innovation at one of Australia’s largest digital experience and technology agencies.Dave grew up in Bendigo, Victoria and tries to spend as much time as possible exploring remote parts of Australia, either hiking or in his Land Rover Defender.Marteen Burger - Co-founder & COOMarteen has worked in advertising and production for twenty years.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amp-bikes.com/wp-content/themes/gli/_/img/gif/commute.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Urban Commute</strong> - When folded, the Errand is the perfect size to stow away in a small closet or behind a couch. Just unfold it, hop on, and go! Using the throttle control, you can travel across town without breaking a sweat. No pedaling necessary! Fold the Errand back up when you get to work and carry it into the office. It's easily hidden next to your desk. You can even charge it during the day so you're ready to hit the road again at quitting time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amp-bikes.com/wp-content/themes/gli/_/img/gif/trail2.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>On The Trail</strong> - Headed out on the trail for some easy weekend riding with your family? The Errand is a great option for everyone. If you want to work up a sweat, simply use it like a traditional bike. But if you need to pull a few kiddos behind you, just give the throttle a twist and get the extra boost you need. And when you're all done, the Errand folds up nicely to fit in the back of your car.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amp-bikes.com/wp-content/themes/gli/_/img/gif/tour.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Sightseeing/Touring</strong> - Exploring a new theme park, tourist attraction, or urban center on vacation? The Errand is the perfect solution for traversing new terrain. Since everyone already knows how to ride a bike, there's no learning curve! Plus, the comfort and familiarity of a bike, combined with the option to pedal or use throttle, makes the Errand a great alternative to other touring vehicles.</p>

</div></div>","Our Core Values

We want our riders to feel connected to our products, so we design them to be stylish and inspiring. This guides our design philosophy and is why we integrate all the electronics, keeping them hidden from view and out of the way of rider.

We believe electric bicycles have a big part to play in America’s future recreation and transportation. All of our electric bicycles are designed and built for performance, convenience, and value which makes the AMP Errand Electric Bicycle a great choice - We want EVERYONE to have one!

On an electric bike that only has pedal assist, the motor only turns on if you're pedaling. We believe that our riders should always be able to control the power and speed of our electric bicycles, so all of our bikes come with throttle control.

In addition to the values espoused above, we are also a CVE-verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business dedicated to providing every customer with unmatched service and quality. AMP Errand has partnered with 1% For The Planet, with our pledge to give 1% of annual revenues back to environmental charities.

AMP In The Real World

There are thousands of uses for the AMP Errand Electric Bicycle. How will you use yours? We've got a few suggestions:

Urban Commute - When folded, the Errand is the perfect size to stow away in a small closet or behind a couch. Just unfold it, hop on, and go! Using the throttle control, you can travel across town without breaking a sweat. No pedaling necessary! Fold the Errand back up when you get to work and carry it into the office. It's easily hidden next to your desk. You can even charge it during the day so you're ready to hit the road again at quitting time.

On The Trail - Headed out on the trail for some easy weekend riding with your family? The Errand is a great option for everyone. If you want to work up a sweat, simply use it like a traditional bike. But if you need to pull a few kiddos behind you, just give the throttle a twist and get the extra boost you need. And when you're all done, the Errand folds up nicely to fit in the back of your car.

Sightseeing/Touring - Exploring a new theme park, tourist attraction, or urban center on vacation? The Errand is the perfect solution for traversing new terrain. Since everyone already knows how to ride a bike, there's no learning curve! Plus, the comfort and familiarity of a bike, combined with the option to pedal or use throttle, makes the Errand a great alternative to other touring vehicles.

A Cut Above The Rest

Normally, an electric bike of this style with this size motor would retail for anywhere between $1,200 and $1,800. But because we are the manufacturer and because of our ""low-cost operator"" business model, we're able to bring this AMP Errand Electric Bicycle to you for the fantastic price of $499 (shipping included).
These prices include freight and are a one-time offer for this Indiegogo program. These are the wholesale prices, and they are an incredible value.
Because our Errand is a current production model for us, the assembly line is already set up and we can start production in less than 30 days. The shipping included in your price is by sea and domestic carrier, but if you prefer to receive your bike faster you can pay an extra $200 and we will air freight it to you straight from our factory.

Why Indiegogo? Why Now?
We want every home in America to have an AMP Errand Electric Bicycle! But, we are currently out of stock on our initial production run. Indiegogo allows us to offer the bike at wholesale price to jumpstart the next production run.

We've been developing software projects for 20 years combined and we're filled with so much ambition that we can't stop wondering how much fun a ridesharing project would be. So, for the last 2 months, we've been working on a basic prototype for a next generation mobile application that will drive new users to our platform. We've provided some screenshots for you to see that we're well into the development process already.Come Hitch A Ride With Us. The goal of our project is to apply the ridesharing concept with a deeper focus on the drivers. Our App gives drivers a virtual platform called Hitch. Hitch allows customers to connect with drivers when they need a cheap ride around town. Once a customer has ""Hitched a ride"", we charge a minimal fee via credit card. Here's how you can Hitch a Ride from our prototype. Our App will be available on both the Google Play and Apple App Stores . So, we'll be supporting all of the latest smartphones on the market. We want each of our customers to feel confident that their data is protected and we've created a secure Customer Profile Page, to gather personal information. Here's our Customer Profile Screen.Encryption of credit card information is paramount to the integrity of our platform. Customer information will be transported through secure network ports during the payment process and while the rider is requesting a,""Hitch"".

LATEST NEWS!




 - ""When installing the Intelligent Spark plug our production AWD 450 DS motorcycle started and performed better than with a standard spark plug. Idle was noticeably more stable, smoother and acceleration improved"" says Steve Christini, Owner of Christini All Wheel Drive Motorcycles, USA
CHRISTINI AWD 450DS is a Street Legal Dual Sport AWD (All Wheel Drive) Bike equipped with a 450cc Liquid-cooled single cylinder four stroke engine.



 - Intelligent Spark Plug will be officially introduced at SEMA Show, Racing & Performance Section.  November 1-4  2016, Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada


INTELLIGENT SPARK PLUGWHEN INSTALLED ON OLDER CARS, ENGINES RUN LIKE NEW!NEW CAR ENGINES RUN LIKE ELECTRIC ONES!It is easy to install and makes the engine more efficient.Spark plugs are used in ALL gasoline engines


The Intelligent Spark Plug works by delivering the sparks via a circle shaped area positioned appropriately from the cylinder walls, from the top to the bottom of the piston chamber and adorned 360 degrees around the center electrode; red volume on the diagram.

Intelligent Spark Plug 
A significant contribution to saving our planet and our health




The following video was prepared by a team of undergraduate students at Central Michigan University; Big Thank You Elizabeth!
Please have a look!


Intelligent Spark Plug is here, already tested for more than 100,000 miles  and with your support will be available to everyone. Together we can fix the past and improve our future! 

We are looking to raise $100,000. This amount will help us move from functional prototypes to mass production.  

If we reach $500,000, we will offer free shipping worldwide.Outside of the United States, one might have to pay some import taxes based on local regulations.If we don't reach the entire goal, we will fulfill the orders, but there might be some production delays.
  You can help us by spreading the word!Please check our website: www.usalpc.comUse Indiegogo share tools and social media to let your family and friends know about this revolutionary, game-changing product!

* per year, for a family with two vehicles.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSQuestion:Any side effects that can affect my engine?
Answer:Yes there are side effects; good side effects, the engine life is extended.With 800% better ignition the combustion is faster and complete.A faster combustion generate more power and less heat; the engine will run cooler with less wear.A complete combustion produce more power and less unburned fuel; no emissions plus no carbon build-ups inside the engine.
Please see the dash board for the two 2016 Toyota RAV4 we did use for the fuel efficacy test and please note that for the same distance driven with the same average speed in the same period of time, the one with Intelligent Spark Plugs have a better fuel consumption.

Now please have a look at the zoom-in picture below and please note that due to a better power and torque resulted from the fast and complete combustion, the idling RPM and engine temperature are a notch lower.

New engines  are controlled by ECM or Engine Computer Module. The computer software can be upgrated and then the engine can take fully advantage of the Intelligent Spark Plug, with even more fuel savings and power increase. Question:How about warranty and returns?
Answer:We offer Lifetime Warranty.If not satisfied with our product we offer full refund.
Question:Wow!! it looks awesome!! I would like to see the same test with the entire machine filmed. thanks a lot.﻿
Answer:Please see a new raw footage video with the 25CC small engine: This new video presents the whole set-up and the replacing of the conventional spark plug with the Intelligent Spark Plug  not edited. With conventional Spark Plug the idling speed averaged 3,200 RPMs at that particular outside temperature. As soon as the conventional spark plug was replaced with the Intelligent Spark Plug, the idling speed went down to an average of 2,600 RPMS...some 20% better efficiency...just by replacing the spark plug.
Comment:The first test with the lighter has a huge difference in the size of the flame. Which would mean that the flow valve on the lighter is set differently for the two plugs...Answer:Please see the picture below that compares the sparking capabilities for conventional spark plugs and for the Intelligent Spark Plug. 
Intelligent Spark Plug strikes 360 degrees around the center electrode in a volume that is 20-100
times bigger than a conventional spark plug.Now please see the new raw video with the ignition test and with a lighter that has a constant flow, so there is no way to adjust the propane flow. The propane flow was not enough to ignite the iridium spark plug, but again the propane flow is not adjustable on this model.",9.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello to all, we are Andrea and Sebastian and we have really different backgrounds, Andrea is a child therapist and I am a steelworker. Even though, we make a good team so we got married. I had built one kart by then, not so strong or reliable but more than enough to imagine some new systems but mentally broken. So with Andrea's help and energy we decided to push the project forward and make it happen no matter what.</p>
<p>After two years and 5 fully working prototypes, here we are working on GoatKart, entrepreneurship dedicated to solving issues related to off-road mobility.<br/>With one idea in mind, to bring accessibility to off-road areas from the fields to outdoor tours, from crowded areas to places without pathways.  </p>
<p>With a big load capacity and strong electric engine, this noiseless machines can carry up to 450 kilos of whatever you need to move whit their 2 trolleys, in a cool and safe way. And the most important, its lightweight will let you move around without damaging the environment. A green solution for offroad mobility. These karts can reach a maximum speed of 20km/h and 40km per charge.</p>
<p>Where can be used? for farming, for offroad tourism, for festivals, for competition, almost for anything you need to do in offroad, or just for fun, you name it.</p>
<p>From 2017 until now we have built all prototypes completely handmade and we want to build them in series. So we got to a point where we need your help to set a better workshop and industrialize our product. We already have a 100 square meter workshop, yeah.  But we need better tools to make it faster and better.</p>
<p>It has been a really long journey and we want you to be a part of it!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to start with a fleet of 15 GoatKarts and 30 trolleys to rent them out or sell them and offer logistics service to outdoor events such as festivals, fairs or offroad tours and keep on building new prototypes and pushing our designs forward.</p>
<p>For that, we need a few things.</p>
<p>- just a couple of tools that will make working easier like a bandsaw for steel and a new vice, mine is broken and lacks precision. All the other tools I mostly have or I can build by myself.</p>
<p>-as we want to build 15 karts and 30 trolleys there will be some pieces that we will need to externalize and that will have some extra cost but the results will be much better.</p>
<p>-off course some marketing and multimedia to be able to show you how things are going.</p>
<p>-and never the less, materials for the build.. pieces... accessories.... steel... etc. things you need if you want to build a GoatKart.</p>
<p>It would be amazing for not to say a dream come true to be able to make it happen in this way. if this is not the case, we already said it. We will make it happen no matter what, so it will.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>For a long time now, heavy vehicles have been used in areas where the floor is too weak to hold their weight, damaging not only the view but also the floor, taking grass away and making big holes followed by mud and erosion. Therefore we bring a vehicle that even though can go through the most difficult terrain, it does not damage the floor in such a way. It's thin and robust wheels won't dig any further being able to drive over small trees without breaking them.</p>
<p>We have been in a couple of festivals where machinery was a big issue when the festival's doors are open, making it extremely dangerous to drive and slower than usual. With our karts we helped moving equipment, building materials, water, loads of dirt, etc. we even took paramedics and passengers with luggage on time and safe anywhere around the field, sorting out in this way all these logistics problems while keeping the environment clean and far from destruction.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For all of this plan, we will need to rearrange the workshop and get used to other ways of building, besides the way of planing and all the responsibilities that it all takes and we know it. It will be difficult but loads of learning and thinking on the way and we are looking forward to them. We started two years ago with one small kart built in a room in our flat, now we have a bigger workshop, bigger ideas, and better designs.</p>
<p>We are passionate and hard-working people. As you already seen, we have been working alone for two years.. you can trust that sometimes things get difficult but at the end of the day, we always find a way to get those things solved and push them forward. We want to make it happen and we will.</p>If you can't contribute please help to share! we will more than grateful! and do not forget to use indiego tools!<p> </p>

<p>My name is Diego and I am an Automotive Engineering student. My father and I are working on an invention that can help stop the never-ending problem of impaired and mindless driving.

<p>Hey backers! Thanks for visiting our Text To Ticket (TTT) mobile app campaign. We're a team based in San Francisco, California with backgrounds in Serial Entrepreneurship, Public Health, Law, and Government IT Consulting. Our vision for TTT began with a deep concern and a dash of frustration with the amount of distracted driving (aka texting and driving) we saw in SF. The amount of near accidents, real accidents and serious injuries we saw as a result of distracted drivers was more than we could bear. As a group that focuses on Public Safety, we had to do something about it.</p>
<p>The numbers around distracted driving are startling: </p>
<ul>
<li>The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to <strong>1.6 million crashes</strong> each year</li>
<li>Distracted driving causes <strong>1 out of every 4 accidents</strong>
</li>
<li>Someone texting &amp; driving is <strong>6x more likely to get into an accident</strong> than someone under the influence of alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>Text to Ticket is the first mobile app of it's kind. Our mission is to reduce the amount of distracted driving by empowering people to report violators, and in exchange, get paid. Our premise is simple, and our vision is broad: we want to change the perception of texting and driving, because the reality is ... <strong>it's the most dangerous activity on the road today.</strong></p>

<h3>Recreating a milestone in automotive history</h3>
<p>The Volkswagen Beetle would not have existed without <a href=""http://josefganz.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Josef Ganz</a> - a Jewish engineer who masterminded its basic design. We want to bring international acclaim to his work by rebuilding <i>his </i>""Volkswagen"" - the 1933 Standard Superior:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488843404/d5gbgvzf2cvtvi1tauo5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Dutch journalist &amp; writer Paul Schilperoord met Lorenz Schmid, a Swiss-born relative of Josef Ganz, when he was researching for the biography of Josef Ganz - and together we bought the Standard Superior.</li>
<li>Our car has the only complete surviving rolling chassis of the Standard Superior type I - an estimated 250 cars were built from April to September 1933. (This model was followed by the type II with different body styling)</li>
<li>The aim of our campaign is to raise funds to recreate the original beetle-shaped bodywork for this chassis - working with professional restorers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489265717/cqwxnpngbbbfybthjqmk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our goals &amp; ambitions</h3>
<p>If we are successful, the restored Standard Superior will be used in future international exhibitions &amp; events to promote the work of <a href=""http://josefganz.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Josef Ganz</a> (1898-1967):</p>

You can even go for a ride!</li>
<li>Should we not reach our entire goal, we will restore what we can with funds raised and keep searching for additional funds to complete the project and unveil the Standard Superior at the <a href=""http://www.louwmanmuseum.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Louwman Museum</a> as planned.</li>
<li>Stretch goals: If we raise more funds than initially required, we will use these to create exact replicas of interior trim, chairs, missing technical parts, etc.</li>

<h3>Our plan to recreate the original beetle shape</h3>
<p>Our car miraculously survived as it was kept on the road in East Germany for decades. Its chassis and running gear is fully original - including the wheels and wings - but the bodywork has been largely modified using Trabant P50 parts:</p>

<h3>The Standard Superior in Volkswagen history</h3>
<p>The Standard Superior is the embodiment of Josef Ganz's propaganda campaign ""For the German Volkswagen"". As editor-in-chief of <i>Motor-Kritik</i> magazine, he outlined the specs for this future car: low-slung, streamlined, backbone chassis, rear-mounted engine, fully independent suspension with swing axles - and a price not exceeding 1,000 Reichsmark.</p>

<p>Ganz initially built two prototypes: the 1930 Ardie-Ganz and 1931 Adler <i>Maikäfer</i> (May Bug). As a technology demonstrator, the May Bug (see video above - with Josef Ganz behind the wheel!) inspired the industry to develop radical new prototypes - including the Mercedes-Benz 120, Tatra V570, Zündapp Type 12 ""Volksauto"" by Ferdinand Porsche (photo below, right), and Standard Superior based on the patents of Josef Ganz (photo below, left).</p>

<p>At the time of its introduction at the 1933 Berlin motor show, the Standard Superior was the only 4-wheeled, rear-engined car in production. At the show, the Superior caught the eye of Hitler - and was hailed by the press:</p>
<ul>
<li>""On 4 wheels runs the highlight of the exhibition [...] rear engine = the future"" - <i>Die Neue Stadt</i>
</li>
<li>""the most advanced despite its small proportions"" - <i>Motor und Sport</i>

<li>""The Standard Superior, as devised by Ganz, has proven extraordinarily successful [...] and it will in all probability lead to the introduction of larger models with rear-mounted engines."" - <i>ADAC-Motorwelt</i>

<p>A journalist for <i>The Detroit News</i> concluded: ""Whatever may be the future development of this type of car in Germany, without doubt the Hitler government will be responsible for its popularization."" Although Hitler would indeed popularize the ""Volkswagen"", even the most prophetic journalist could not have foreseen that in the process he would deliberately erase the visionary Jewish engineer Josef Ganz from history.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>Our main challenges are that no technical drawings are known to exist for the Standard Superior Type I - and that we need to find a number of original parts for the car that was only produced in very limited numbers in 1933:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to work with specialists to recreate the original shape of the bodywork based on period photographs and a surviving original Standard Superior Type II. This car has different body styling but a similar overall construction.</li>
<li>A number of the original parts we need to find are electrical parts. Standard exclusively used parts by Bosch, which already was a well-established company at the time.</li>
<li>We plan to make regular trips to specialized events for pre-WWII cars, such as the <a href=""http://www.veterama.de/de/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VETERAMA</a>, to search for missing parts.</li>

Recreating a milestone in automotive history
The Volkswagen Beetle would not have existed without Josef Ganz - a Jewish engineer who masterminded its basic design. We want to bring international acclaim to his work by rebuilding his ""Volkswagen"" - the 1933 Standard Superior:


Dutch journalist & writer Paul Schilperoord met Lorenz Schmid, a Swiss-born relative of Josef Ganz, when he was researching for the biography of Josef Ganz - and together we bought the Standard Superior.
Our car has the only complete surviving rolling chassis of the Standard Superior type I - an estimated 250 cars were built from April to September 1933. (This model was followed by the type II with different body styling)
The aim of our campaign is to raise funds to recreate the original beetle-shaped bodywork for this chassis - working with professional restorers.



Our goals & ambitions
If we are successful, the restored Standard Superior will be used in future international exhibitions & events to promote the work of Josef Ganz (1898-1967):

In return for your support we offer some very special perks - scroll down for more information and photos - including the biography of Josef Ganz, AutoCult's new set of 1:43 ""Pre-Volkswagen"" models, ""Psychomotor"" artwork by Swiss artist Rémy Markowitsch - and a unique event at the Louwman Museum to present the car. You can even go for a ride!
Should we not reach our entire goal, we will restore what we can with funds raised and keep searching for additional funds to complete the project and unveil the Standard Superior at the Louwman Museum as planned.
Stretch goals: If we raise more funds than initially required, we will use these to create exact replicas of interior trim, chairs, missing technical parts, etc.


Our plan to recreate the original beetle shape
Our car miraculously survived as it was kept on the road in East Germany for decades. Its chassis and running gear is fully original - including the wheels and wings - but the bodywork has been largely modified using Trabant P50 parts:

Step 1: take the existing bodywork off the chassis and clean up or renovate original parts, such as chassis, wheels and wings.
Step 2: the wooden bodywork will be reconstructed by Stellmacherei Tiede - using many original photographs from the Josef Ganz archives - and their associated partners will install artificial leather covering the wooden bodywork, do the paintwork and install windows and interior trim.
Step 3: locate and install missing parts, such as original lights, steering wheel, dashboard switches, door handles, radiator, etc.

As editor-in-chief of Motor-Kritik magazine, he outlined the specs for this future car: low-slung, streamlined, backbone chassis, rear-mounted engine, fully independent suspension with swing axles - and a price not exceeding 1,000 Reichsmark.

<div>On May 18th, 2015 Dot Com Zambia will launch its Bus Tickets Zambia project starting in Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. <p>Bus
Tickets Zambia is a
convenient and reliable way for the general public in Zambia to book their inter-city
bus tickets online, using a variety of method from their feature phones to
purchasing the ticket from an authorized agent like Post Dot Net, and then paying for the tickets
using their bank cards, mobile phones or make cash payments to an authorized
agent. Bus Tickets Zambia aims to decentralize intercity public bus travel for
all Zambians regardless of social standing in society.</p>
</div> <p></p>
<p>For nearly 2 years,
Dot Com Zambia has been developing this system to make intercity bus travel more convenient, more efficient and more
accessible to the general public through technology. The scale of this project
is unprecedented in Zambia and across Africa and will change the way bus travel
is conducted, not only in Zambia, but across Africa.</p>
<p>Our project has
received tremendous support from the general public as well as acclaim from the
international community including a recent recognition from Harvard University,
which included a $15,000 grant, as the best new business venture in Africa for
2015 as well a $7500 Grant at the 2014 Global Innovation for Science and Technology
Competition sponsored by the U.S state Department.</p>
<p>However like many
entrepreneurs, bringing our business to market has been challenging, but
through sheer will and support from various private parties, we have been
able to develop a lot of the project on our own, creating jobs along the way
and a valuable system that solves a common Africa problem built by Zambians. </p>

<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>We still need resources to bring this project to completion and we are seeking support from you to in the final stages to bring this project to market. The amount we are targeting is at least $7000 to go towards building a feature phone system and SMS that would allow travelers with the most basic of phones and living in small towns and rural Zambia to access buses. Using this system a customer can just dial a short code like 360# and reserve their bus ticket or they can send an SMS to a short code like 3006 and reserve their bus ticket that way.</div>
<div>The funds will go towards the set up fee for this system with the relevant telecommunications authorities in Zambia. At $7000 in year 1 and $4000 every year there after, these fees are tough for aspiring entrepreneurs and smaller businesses. Your generosity will be greatly appreciated.</div>

<h3>Who Will this Impact?</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p><i>“Mr John Banda, is a trader, who lives 60 minutes outside of Kasama. Mr Banda travels
to Lusaka for business twice a month to buy supplies for his store and small
farm. This is a trip he dreads.  Bus
travel is the only way he can travel. He will wake up in the morning and make
the 45 minute journey to the main road. Once at the main road he waits for
hours and several buses from Kasama going to Lusaka will pass Mr Banda and typically
not one will stop. So he has to make the decision to hitch hike or jump on a smaller local bus back to Kasama or Mpika and start his long journey from there
and when things area really bad his journey to Lusaka starts the next day,
meaning he would have spent 3 days travelling. His return journey is marginally smoother, but there are times he has missed the 14:30 time bus back to Kasama on the popular buses, which means  waiting for hours for any bus or sometimes sleeping at Intercity Bus Station and leaving the next day. But because he boards the bus in Lusaka, the bus driver will at least stop at the junction to his small town, which is at least a relief.</i></p>
<p><i>“Monika Kabwafwile lives near Kafue, a place she says is the worst when it comes to bus travel. If she is travelling to the Coperbelt, she has to find her way to Lusaka intercity first and then work out how to travel from there. If she is going to the South, then she was to wait by the roadside and see what bus she can chance on its way to Livingstone. Once or twice she has tried to make her way to the station in kafue to reserrve a seat. While this has worked from time to time, it is  still a game of chance as the bus has to leave Lusaka with an empty seat, but this requires the two station to manually cordinate.”<br/></i></p>

<p><i><i>Cant that bus operator pick up this traveller in towns where they don’t have stations? Why can’t the traveller reserve and pay for that ticket in advance thus giving them peace of mind and securing their journey?</i><br/></i></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>I had the pleasure
of  meeting Sir Richard Branson in
December, 2014 at the Zambia Investment Conference .One comment that he made in
particular resonated with me, “the best businesses are born out of
frustration”. I
recall in 2013 I had to travel from Lusaka to Nakonde by bus, and I went
through the most frustrating of experiences to purchase a ticket. I knew then,
they had to be a better way, and I could not be alone in this view. And rightly
enough 100% of the market that we interviewed felt the same way as I did. And
at that point Bus Tickets Zambia was born and little did I know, at the time, that
the project that started with an objective of trying to buy a simple bus ticket
would morph into this large scale venture.</p>
<p>The ineffeciencies of bus travel is clear to see, with people outside of urban areas in particular hardest hit by buses that want full loads from the point of origin. And as an economy how much productivity and money do we lose because of the ineffeciencies in the system? Time is the most valuable commodity that people have. Bus Tickets Zambia has a social responsibility to change this and it will. Once fully implemented Bus Tickets will have tremendous social and economic impact on the transportation sector in Zambia and more importantly create jobs<br/></p>
<p>But like many Zambian entrepreneurs the road has
been tough,  I started Dot Com Zambia in 2009 alongside myself and one other
employee operating out of my kitchen. We had no access to capital, but we managed to get our first customer
to pay us in advance and from there we grew primarily by word of mouth. And
with the income we generated we reinvested it back into the business.</p>
<p>Today, we now have 18 employees in Zambia
alongside 3 international offices and with Bus tickets Zambia, we have already
created 8 jobs and are set to create another 10 jobs immediately after the  business is
launched, mainly in IT and customer service.  As an entrepreneur, there is no greater feeling than telling someone that they are hired and they can come to work for this amazing
small company with huge ambition.</p>
<p>We have a ground breaking
project that has the potential to succeed in Zambia and grow beyond our
borders, but we need help to make this happened and I need your support to make this a reality.</p> </div> <div> <h3>You Can Help</h3> <p>You can help make this happened, support this project and ask others to support it as well. through social media</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an organization, we still have a lot of work to
do, but the work done to date has been superb in getting us closer to our
objectives. I am confident that we will
execute. And your support will allow us to execute our social contract and
responsibility to Zambia which include:</p>
<p>1)<span> 
</span>A commitment to create employment, And the
more we can grow and possibly expand internationally the more jobs we will create.</p>
<p>2)<span> 
</span>Continue to make our country
proud and show that Zambia has entrepreneurs that  have the potential to achieve great things.</p>

Dot Com Zambia has been developing this system to make intercity bus travel more convenient, more efficient and more
accessible to the general public through technology. The scale of this project
is unprecedented in Zambia and across Africa and will change the way bus travel
is conducted, not only in Zambia, but across Africa.
Our project has
received tremendous support from the general public as well as acclaim from the
international community including a recent recognition from Harvard University,
which included a $15,000 grant, as the best new business venture in Africa for
2015 as well a $7500 Grant at the 2014 Global Innovation for Science and Technology
Competition sponsored by the U.S state Department.
However like many
entrepreneurs, bringing our business to market has been challenging, but
through sheer will and support from various private parties, we have been
able to develop a lot of the project on our own, creating jobs along the way
and a valuable system that solves a common Africa problem built by Zambians.

   What We Need 
We still need resources to bring this project to completion and we are seeking support from you to in the final stages to bring this project to market. The amount we are targeting is at least $7000 to go towards building a feature phone system and SMS that would allow travelers with the most basic of phones and living in small towns and rural Zambia to access buses. Using this system a customer can just dial a short code like 360# and reserve their bus ticket or they can send an SMS to a short code like 3006 and reserve their bus ticket that way.
The funds will go towards the set up fee for this system with the relevant telecommunications authorities in Zambia. At $7000 in year 1 and $4000 every year there after, these fees are tough for aspiring entrepreneurs and smaller businesses. Your generosity will be greatly appreciated.

Who Will this Impact?

“Mr John Banda, is a trader, who lives 60 minutes outside of Kasama. Mr Banda travels
to Lusaka for business twice a month to buy supplies for his store and small
farm. This is a trip he dreads.  Bus
travel is the only way he can travel. He will wake up in the morning and make
the 45 minute journey to the main road. Once at the main road he waits for
hours and several buses from Kasama going to Lusaka will pass Mr Banda and typically
not one will stop. So he has to make the decision to hitch hike or jump on a smaller local bus back to Kasama or Mpika and start his long journey from there
and when things area really bad his journey to Lusaka starts the next day,
meaning he would have spent 3 days travelling. His return journey is marginally smoother, but there are times he has missed the 14:30 time bus back to Kasama on the popular buses, which means  waiting for hours for any bus or sometimes sleeping at Intercity Bus Station and leaving the next day. But because he boards the bus in Lusaka, the bus driver will at least stop at the junction to his small town, which is at least a relief.
“Monika Kabwafwile lives near Kafue, a place she says is the worst when it comes to bus travel. If she is travelling to the Coperbelt, she has to find her way to Lusaka intercity first and then work out how to travel from there. If she is going to the South, then she was to wait by the roadside and see what bus she can chance on its way to Livingstone. Once or twice she has tried to make her way to the station in kafue to reserrve a seat. While this has worked from time to time, it is  still a game of chance as the bus has to leave Lusaka with an empty seat, but this requires the two station to manually cordinate.”


Cant that bus operator pick up this traveller in towns where they don’t have stations? Why can’t the traveller reserve and pay for that ticket in advance thus giving them peace of mind and securing their journey?
OUR INSPIRATION COMES FROM PEOPLE LIKE JOHN AND MONICA AND THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN TO US ASKING FOR THIS CHANGE !!!



  Appeal Message From The  Founder




  
I had the pleasure
of  meeting Sir Richard Branson in
December, 2014 at the Zambia Investment Conference .One comment that he made in
particular resonated with me, “the best businesses are born out of
frustration”. I
recall in 2013 I had to travel from Lusaka to Nakonde by bus, and I went
through the most frustrating of experiences to purchase a ticket. I knew then,
they had to be a better way, and I could not be alone in this view. And rightly
enough 100% of the market that we interviewed felt the same way as I did. And
at that point Bus Tickets Zambia was born and little did I know, at the time, that
the project that started with an objective of trying to buy a simple bus ticket
would morph into this large scale venture.
The ineffeciencies of bus travel is clear to see, with people outside of urban areas in particular hardest hit by buses that want full loads from the point of origin. And as an economy how much productivity and money do we lose because of the ineffeciencies in the system? Time is the most valuable commodity that people have. Bus Tickets Zambia has a social responsibility to change this and it will. Once fully implemented Bus Tickets will have tremendous social and economic impact on the transportation sector in Zambia and more importantly create jobs
But like many Zambian entrepreneurs the road has
been tough,  I started Dot Com Zambia in 2009 alongside myself and one other
employee operating out of my kitchen. We had no access to capital, but we managed to get our first customer
to pay us in advance and from there we grew primarily by word of mouth. And
with the income we generated we reinvested it back into the business.
Today, we now have 18 employees in Zambia
alongside 3 international offices and with Bus tickets Zambia, we have already
created 8 jobs and are set to create another 10 jobs immediately after the  business is
launched, mainly in IT and customer service.  As an entrepreneur, there is no greater feeling than telling someone that they are hired and they can come to work for this amazing
small company with huge ambition.
We have a ground breaking
project that has the potential to succeed in Zambia and grow beyond our
borders, but we need help to make this happened and I need your support to make this a reality.   You Can Help You can help make this happened, support this project and ask others to support it as well. through social media

As an organization, we still have a lot of work to
do, but the work done to date has been superb in getting us closer to our
objectives. I am confident that we will
execute. And your support will allow us to execute our social contract and
responsibility to Zambia which include:
1) 
A commitment to create employment, And the
more we can grow and possibly expand internationally the more jobs we will create.
2) 
Continue to make our country
proud and show that Zambia has entrepreneurs that  have the potential to achieve great things.

With regenerative braking, you can charge your board while going downhill. Not only does it look good in the day, it’s stunning at night too. With the built-in LED lights in the front and back, it enables you to see as well as be seen. It’s IPX7 waterproof, so rain or puddles won’t ever be a problem.The board comes with a single or double brushless AC motors. Each motor is equipped with 900W of power, totalling to 1800W for the dual motors. Its efficient cooling system boosts the longevity of the motor, making this the only electric skateboard you’ll ever need! The sealed motor is made of high quality steel and has gone through high precision CNC to ensure the best safety. A powerful takeoff is guaranteed by the 180ºC high temperature-resistant copper enamelled wire. N40 ndfeb magnet, imported silicon steel stator, Japanese NSK high-speed motor bearing, and customized high-quality tracks all contribute to the motor’s stability and power.The deck is made out of a space grade 7075 aluminum, making it one of the strongest boards on the market. For its durable frame, it’s surprising light, weighting at 6.7 kgs / 14.7 lbs.The 51º truck ensures the best performances in safety, load bearing, powerful takeoff and turning ability! Hurricane X’s durable deck, a space grade 7075 aluminum, allows it to bear up to 135 kg / 300 lbs.The high damping shock absorption mat and PU wheels boost the overall shock absorption of the board by increasing the shock absorption rate by 30%. Enjoy the smoothest ride on the Hurricane X!Similar to the motor, 2 options are available to control the board as well. With the hand held controller, you can just hop on and go as soon as you unbox it. The controller was ergonomically designed to deliver the most comfortable fit.Or connect through our app!  It gives you the ability to control the skateboard, battery life reminders, and route history of where you’ve been. It’s also equipped with AI, learning your movements and habits, to offer you the best riding experience by making automatic adjustments! The Hurricane X is designed with a USB port to turn your skateboard into a personal power bank.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""Our vision is to build the most affordable and reliable electric super-bike in the world that beats petrol powered motorbikes in their own field""</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Introduction :</h3>
<p>        We are an Indian start-up, developing what will be India's first electric Superbike named the EP-1, The electric Superbike will be <strong>comparable to 600-650 cc motorbikes</strong> with internal combustion engines in terms of performance, with a top speed of <strong>250 km/h</strong>  The bike will run more than <strong>500 km on a single charge </strong></p>
<p>The Conceptual phase of the bike is completed, which is, the complete detail design is ready, the electronics have been tested in modules and analyzed and we have done extensive virtual testing with different scenarios and different environmental conditions, theoretically we can reach 500 and above kilometers on a sport bike on one charge with our custom discharge algorithms and optimal overall aerodynamics you could know more about us and check our results out Below<br/><br/>After the project is completed we will be running an Electric bike Endurance Road Trip Going from Bangalore to Goa (556 Kilometers or 345 miles) For the india Bike Week on a Single charge and presenting it to all the Motorcycle fans (30,000 riders) present there</p>
<p>In the next steps of our project, we have plans for participating in the European Pikes Peak Hill climb challenge and set a record,</p>
<p>And Later We will be taking part in the Isle Of Mann TT Zero Challenge 2020, That will be a great opportunity to test out all our systems with your batteries in it.</p>

<p>     We understand your skepticism, The Numbers do sound ridiculous, The Range Given by us is done with limited power and speed,the numbers are tested and simulated and then published, Our current battery energy is at 18.4 Kilowatt-hours, the range figures where calculated at a limited current output of 120A , aerodynamics coefficient of .41 with rolling resistance :0.023 , face surface of 46 m2, the total weight of the bike including the rider was at 250 KG with a maximum electronics efficiency of 93%, we have close to zero conversion losses, we get a range of 521 kilometers at a limited speed of 82.5 Km/h </p>
<p>But even that might not validate our claims, there already is an electric Superbike, The Lightning LS-218 which has a 150 kilowatt motor and a 20 kWh battery pack which gives 250 kilometers on a single charge, we use a motor that is 3 times less power consuming and is further limited for high range, 500 kilometers is possible with proper power regulation and electronics</p>
<h3>2. It looks Ugly</h3>
<p>We agree, The Outer body is just a concept and was built just to calculate aerodynamic forces, the final design will be revealed during the Bike launch, and it will be Beautiful</p>
<h3>3. What is the current state of development for the bike? What will the funding be used for?</h3>
<p>The Conceptual phase of the bike is completed, which is, the complete detail design is ready, the electronics have been tested in modules and analysed, the funds will be used for Complete integration, prototype iteration and Electronics and software development</p>
<h3>4. Why Are you doing this? and why did you target a range of 500 kilometers</h3>
<p>As charging times are high in electric bikes, it wouldn’t make sense to keep the range to 200 kilometers, there would be no actual real world use, there are no charging stations in India and even if someone keeps the motorcycle for charging in some one’s home it’ll take hours, so we had to choose between getting the range Higher, or getting the charge times lower to 15-30 mins. We got the range higher so that the person using the motorbike should charge only once a week for all the weeks commute. And not worry about anything else</p>
<p>We are not looking to make money in the first phase, we just want to prove that doing 500 kilometers or more on a motorbike is possible and break the belief of people that electric bikes are not reliable, </p>
<p>There are already 3 Electric bikes in India with 200 kilometers per charge range, we just wanted to do something different, after the first phase there are plans to build a 500 kilometer range mid range motorbike under 3 lakhs with low powered motors and so on </p>
<p>And as the first bike will be produced in less numbers, and the performance is so high, we couldn't get the price any lower</p>
<h3>5. How do you reach 251km/hour with a 40kW motor?</h3>
<p>40 kiloWatt is the continuous rating 55 kilowatt is the peak power of the PMAC motor, 250km/hr can be reached with 48.38 kW with a torque of 130 n.m , as the motor has proper Heat dissipation systems in place, it can handle 251 kilometers per hour at 0 degree gradient , We are trying to push the limits to test our breaking points before going to market and these are the target numbers we intend to hit, there might be some increments or decrements in top speed and acceleration</p>
<h3>6. So if an SV650 Petrol(Gasoline) race bike with 70 hp can reach around 180 - 190 km/h. how does your bike reach 250km/h, Where do you find the extra 60 km/h?</h3>
<p>That's exactly why we have a fairing without any extra outer features, its completely smooth, with the fairing we get a Cd of .41 and without the fairing we need a lot of wattage or power just to overcome the air resistance, without the outer fairing that our motorcycle has our Cd would reach a high point of .64-.69 depending on the rider sitting up straight or leaning down, the sv650 cannot be made more aerodynamic also because of the upright sitting position . and we would struggle to reach 200, the max speed with that configuration, we would reach 195 km/h or less with perfect conditions, </p>
<p>We get our extra 60 kph just by aerodynamics and the aggressive seating posture of the person(which decreases the overall surface area for aerodynamic efficiency)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>7.How fast will it go?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Economy Mode can go upto 120 km/h</li>
<li>Sport mode can go up to 180 km/h</li>
<li>Race mode Can go upto and is limited to 251 km/h</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.How far can it go?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Economy Mode can go upto 600 kilometers with regenerative braking Per charge</li>
<li>Sport mode can go up to 350 kilometers  with regenerative braking Per Charge</li>
<li>Race mode Can go upto 140 kilometers per charge</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.How long do the batteries last?</h3>
<p>the Lithium ion batteries and cells used in this Bike are rated at  2000 cycles and to imporve this the cells are kept in proper condition and used with multiple safety factors in place to prevent cell overload that reduces battery life</p>
<h3>10.Where will the EP-1 be built?</h3>
<p>It will be built in a small city called Dharwad in India.</p>
<h3>11.Will there be a weight limit?</h3>
<p>The EP-1 will be able to accomodate 2 passengers or a combined weight of 160 kg (360 lbs)</p>
<h3>12.How Much is it going to cost?</h3>
<p>The EP-1 will be sold In three separate versions,</p>
<ol>
<li>The Commuter version will have a low power motor with a Reduced capacity Battery-pack<br/>and will cost around $8,500</li>
<li> The Standard version will have a BLDC motor with a 15 kWh Battery-pack<br/>and will cost around $10,500</li>
<li>The Race version will have a 40 kW motor with a 18.4 kWh Battery-pack<br/>and will cost around $13,000</li>

""Our vision is to build the most affordable and reliable electric super-bike in the world that beats petrol powered motorbikes in their own field""
 
Introduction :
        We are an Indian start-up, developing what will be India's first electric Superbike named the EP-1, The electric Superbike will be comparable to 600-650 cc motorbikes with internal combustion engines in terms of performance, with a top speed of 250 km/h  The bike will run more than 500 km on a single charge 
The Conceptual phase of the bike is completed, which is, the complete detail design is ready, the electronics have been tested in modules and analyzed and we have done extensive virtual testing with different scenarios and different environmental conditions, theoretically we can reach 500 and above kilometers on a sport bike on one charge with our custom discharge algorithms and optimal overall aerodynamics you could know more about us and check our results out BelowAfter the project is completed we will be running an Electric bike Endurance Road Trip Going from Bangalore to Goa (556 Kilometers or 345 miles) For the india Bike Week on a Single charge and presenting it to all the Motorcycle fans (30,000 riders) present there
In the next steps of our project, we have plans for participating in the European Pikes Peak Hill climb challenge and set a record,
And Later We will be taking part in the Isle Of Mann TT Zero Challenge 2020, That will be a great opportunity to test out all our systems with your batteries in it.

The range of lighting outputs and modes helps you spot and avoid frequent urban obstacles, from potholes and curbs to train tracks and trash. It also makes you more visible to city drivers, including those approaching you from the right or left at intersections. And because city rides often involve pit stops indoors, the easily detachable light makes theft-prevention simple.   When you gain speed, the Radius™ F1 light brightens; when you slow down, it dims—and it shifts at the same rate you change speed. This ensures your visibility is always optimal for your speed, and it helps save battery power. RightBright™ technology incorporates:BMI 160, a small, quiet, energy-efficient inertial measurement device that precisely senses your velocity;""Stepless"" speed-controlled beam intensity that adapts light output to your cycling speed by smoothly shifting intensity over a range of lumens.   In addition to auto-adjusting brightness, SecurePulse™ technology automatically switches into a safety-enhancing pulse mode when you’re turning a corner and flashes when you’re braking to a stop, because riding at slower speeds can make you less visible to drivers.     After three minutes of no movement, the light’s PerfectPower™ functionality automatically switches the light to standby mode. Start moving the bike again and the light will wake up and return to default speed-controlled lighting. After 1 hour of bike inactivity, the light’s power shuts off to consume extremely low energy—because nothing is worse than accidentally leaving your light on all night and discovering it’s dead when you set off on your next ride.       Strap this low-profile remote control near your grip tape, and you can manually adjust your light settings without having to take your hands off the handlebars. Rely on the light’s auto-adjustment functionality for the majority of your riding, but have instant control over personal lighting preferences whenever you want it. What's more, it's easy to detach the remote control switch from its bracket.    Hundreds of micro lenses in combination with a reflector generate consistent illumination over both distant and close-up terrain: spot lighting hits further ahead so you’re always prepared for upcoming obstacles; flood lighting illuminates a wider area in front of your bike for superior visibility of pedestrians, parked cars, and other nighttime periphery; and side lights help motorists spot you from multiple angles—not just head-on.   The Radius™ F1 is easy to attach to and release from your handlebars. The bracket can be mounted to the left, right, or center of the stem, and it leaves plenty of room on your handlebars for other bike accessories (including the Radius™ F1 Bluetooth-enabled remote control). The mount and casing firmly secure the bike light for stability and super-steady lighting without jiggling, slipping, or rotation, even on rough roads.When you want to remove the light, the bracket stays on your bike; simply disengage the lock with a 90-degree turn, and the light disconnects from the bracket—pop it off to charge it or to prevent theft if you head inside.    No dirt infiltration, no inroads for water, no damaged USB ports—simply snap the magnet-equipped charger to the light and recharge.   Always know how much life your light has left, thanks to an easy-to-read display on top of the casing. At full brightness the Radius™ F1 has 2 hours of luminosity.         Thanks to precision CNC aluminum machining, the Radius™ F1 provides excellent lighting accuracy and heat transfer. This smart bike light features the highest-grade materials, undergoes only best-in-class manufacturing processes, and meets the highest quality standards, virtually alleviating the need for repairs or part replacements.   Engineered for both aesthetic excellence and technological performance, the Radius™ F1 bike light is modern and minimalist. The sleek aluminum heat sink embraces the low-profile lens-reflector combination with no visible wires or connectors to detract from the light’s clean lines and shape, and the light’s neutral color scheme complements any bike setup.  The Radius™ F1 was constructed with rainy rides in mind—it's IPX6-rated waterproof construction ensures you’ll have long-lasting light, even in the nastiest weather and on the dirtiest roads.

<ul><li>
<b>Mobility is Key:</b> Pop Kitchen is extremely portable. You only need one person to lift it into a car, so you can take it anywhere. Large durable wheels allow it to roll over bumpy, uneven terrain.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Setup is Swift:</b> Unlock and lift the folding table, extend the legs, attach the side shelf and you've got yourself over 5-1/2 feet of usable kitchen counter space. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>On or Off-the-Grid Use:</b> Hook up the sink to a lead-free garden hose at home, or use a hand pressurized water tank for use on the road. Waste water drains into the garden for grey water irrigation or into a receptacle. The stove runs natively on isobutane canisters or with an LPG adapter which is sold separately. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Practical Food Preparation:</b> Use the full size 15"" sink  to fill a stock pot; prep away on the 18"" food-safe side table or recessed cutting board. Fire up the 12,000 BTU burner to boil, stir fry or sauté. Store and organize ingredients and equipment in the enclosed storage area.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Safe, Durable, Easy to Clean:</b> Type 304 stainless steel is the industry standard for food safety. It also looks great anywhere, and cleans easily with a paper towel or cloth. Stainless construction also means no corrosion in the harshest outdoor environments. </li></ul>

The Pop Kitchen was designed and built from the ground-up for anyone looking to enjoy the convenience of having a complete culinary workstation at their fingertips, no matter where. The Pop Kitchen is at home in a school garden, backyard, on a balcony, next to a tiny house, camper, or even in a loft apartment. When not in use, the PK folds up for easy transport or storage.





Key Features






Mobility is Key: Pop Kitchen is extremely portable. You only need one person to lift it into a car, so you can take it anywhere. Large durable wheels allow it to roll over bumpy, uneven terrain.

Setup is Swift: Unlock and lift the folding table, extend the legs, attach the side shelf and you've got yourself over 5-1/2 feet of usable kitchen counter space. 

On or Off-the-Grid Use: Hook up the sink to a lead-free garden hose at home, or use a hand pressurized water tank for use on the road. Waste water drains into the garden for grey water irrigation or into a receptacle. The stove runs natively on isobutane canisters or with an LPG adapter which is sold separately. 

Practical Food Preparation: Use the full size 15"" sink  to fill a stock pot; prep away on the 18"" food-safe side table or recessed cutting board. Fire up the 12,000 BTU burner to boil, stir fry or sauté. Store and organize ingredients and equipment in the enclosed storage area.

Safe, Durable, Easy to Clean: Type 304 stainless steel is the industry standard for food safety. It also looks great anywhere, and cleans easily with a paper towel or cloth. Stainless construction also means no corrosion in the harshest outdoor environments. 
Our Fundraising Goal 

Our funding goal will be used to:

Continue research and development of our final product design


Evaluate, revise and finalize our 3-D solidworks files


Design shipping and retail packaging


Complete tooling and launch our first small-batch manufacturing run

Donate Pop Kitchens to our Community Partners
The number of Pop Kitchens manufactured in the first production run will be dependent on the level of support we achieve.
A limited number of fully-functioning beta units will be made available to our Indiegogo supporters as one-of-a-kind perks. 


Manufacturing

We are developing our Pop Kitchen prototypes in Ventura, California at Trupart Manufacturing.  Shane Prukop, a 3rd generation metal fabricator founded Trupart in 2004, which grew from his grandfather’s factory established in 1973. Shane makes everything from Patagonia’s River Crampon, to intricate parts for the medical and aerospace industries. Trupart has so successfully embraced green manufacturing methods as to be recognized by the California legislature for practicing  environmentally sustainable manufacturing techniques while increasing profitability and creating new jobs.
Working closely with our manufacturer to meet timelines is a priority. Creating the highest quality, most durable product possible is our mission. This all takes a great deal of oversight, so we will be on-site every step of the way to ensure the end product is something in which we will take pride, and that you will enjoy using for years to come.


Our Community Partners

We have chosen three non-profit Ventura County community organizations dedicated to garden-based learning and food insecurity issues to each receive a fully-equipped Pop Kitchen and training at no cost if we reach our funding goal.


Our community partners and IndieGoGo supporters will be asked to road test their units and then give us suggestions for improvements, accessories, and ideas for future features. We will incorporate some of these refinements into our first full production run in 2016. Features currently in development include a built-in bluetooth speaker, spice rack, insulated cold storage area, shade canopy, custom frame colors and an outdoor cover.


Born in a School Garden


I've spent decades working with restaurants, hotels and on the comedy cooking show, Dinner & A Movie. Most recently I've been devoting a great deal of time to teaching food literacy in schools. Since I give classes in places like gardens or classrooms that typically don't have a dedicated cooking area, I usually end up dragging equipment out to the location and then trying to set up some kind of a food prep area on the fly. As you can imagine, this gets old fast.





After speaking with other chefs and educators who face the same challenges, it became clear that there was a real need for a portable, professional-grade culinary workstation. I decided to invent something to fit the bill.  I'm a chef, not a designer so I knew I needed help.
I lucked out in finding a design visionary in my own Ventura County backyard who was excited by the challenge. Gavin Studer and I got to work in February 2014 and rolled out the first PK prototype 6 months later. I was astonished by its portability, ease of use, and utility all in one compact package. My instincts told me that this innovative device could be useful not just in schools, but to anyone who is passionate about cooking and eating well, regardless of the location. 



We've been field testing our Pop Kitchen prototype for the better part of a year; sharing it with garden educators, chefs, fisherman, farmers, caterers, and backyard barbecuers. The most common response thus far has been ""when can I get one?""
That's why we're here asking for your support. We believe this device can improve people's lives, encouraging them to cook together, eat healthier and spend more time outdoors.
–Chef Claud Mann, Co-founder, Co-inventor



The ""Swiss Army Knife"" of Food Prep


After Claud outlined his criteria, it became clear that this device needed to become the Swiss Army Knife of food prep equipment: portable, foldable, affordable and virtually bullet proof. Plus it had to include a sink, stovetop , sanitary cutting surfaces and plenty of storage. 
I challenged myself with creating a piece of equipment for a rigorous
outdoor environment -like a school yard- while also keeping costs down. In my research I found a 1944 military
field desk – essentially a minimalist crate designed for transport that
unfolded into a large desk. I used this concept as a springboard for the
new design.





This is when the concept started synthesizing for me. I wanted to create a modern version of the classic field desk.

- Gavin Studer, Co-Founder & Designer




Our Core Values









Our most critical challenge continues to be staying true to our core values while meeting a realistic consumer price point for the Pop Kitchen. From the beginning, we have aspired to both manufacture and assemble the PK domestically  rather than overseas, even if costs are somewhat higher.


We believe that it's possible that if more companies did their manufacturing work domestically, it might help create local jobs, boost the economy and potentially reduce our carbon footprint.


While manufacturing costs directly affect the retail price, there are also hidden social and environmental costs with which we all must grapple daily in our respective roles as consumers and business people. Although there are no easy answers, we feel it's important for all of us to continue asking the hard questions. 




Challenges










With the PK's various parts and hardware, we are prepared to encounter challenges as we move ahead. For example, after rigorous field testing we eventually discovered that the sliding cutting board design which you currently see in the photo and video doesn't meet our standards for durability and sanitation. The next generation side cutting board is re-designed to be detachable for sanitizing and interchangeability.
The logistics of sourcing, assembly, warehousing and shipping will also take a great deal of coordination. To meet those challenges we will start small, and work closely with our partners and mentors to create the systems needed to ensure clear communication from the beginning of the supply chain to customer delivery.

</div></div>","About our idea
We are just a couple. Not a company. We came up with an idea of sharing wishes between your friends and family members via phone numbers. Everybody can use it on birthday, wedding day, Christmas, ....
So we decide to create a free service and applications for all three major operating systems (iOS, Android and Windows). We want to keep this service free all time because we believe, that only free service like this can succeed.
Applications will work offline and synchronize wishlists when you are online. This is huge advantage because you no need internet in all time and application will be much faster.
We get this idea in Christmas time and because we are soon getting married :) . This is logo of Wishinger application:   
  

Why we need contribution?
 Like we mentioned above - we are not a company.
So starting with this service will be hardest part. We already almost finished development of core service (sharing wishlists, SMS service, cloud data storage) and already started development on mobile applications. We needed some devices for test for all operating systems and for iOS we need Macbook.
But now hardest part seems to be cost for SMS (we need to send verification SMS and sharing notification SMS).
You can find some calculations on our site: www.wishinger.euPer one person is there multiple SMS needed (registration and verification SMS, sharing wishlist SMS notification).
It was hard to say target price because more people cost us more SMS, so we set as target goal 20,000.00$ - it can cover at least part of initial costs.
Sharing wishlists via phone number is one of most important part of our service. You can use and register Wishinger application very easy like WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, .... and you no need any other registration steps.Without this the service has been not used with many people because hard registration will discourage most of them.
    
The Impact We think that most of us know the feeling when you receive gifts but you can imagine more useful things in that price. So with our service can everybody create his own wishes grouped into wish lists and share them to people. Because application and service will be free, these people can install Wishinger application and they automatically see your wishes.
For example, if you want a book for birthday, you can add information about it into Wishinger and if someone bought it, then other people will see it like ""already bought"" (of course you will not :) ).
So advantages are for all of us:  Avoiding inappropriate gifts
Everybody will know what you really wants
Avoiding duplicating gifts
Make buying gifts more simple







Risks

There is some chance, that people will begin use our application too fast and advertisement in our application will not be enough to cover our operating expenses. If this will happen, we will need ask money for installing application on mobile for a short time or disable some SMS features even if it is a one of key features.

But we hope this will never happen and this crowdfunding is good way to avoid this. We mentioned it because we want to stay transparent and clear to you.

<p>Kupper Mounts Suction Cup, Vacuum-Powered Bike Racks!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556202577/lvsavdax4ysghrqztyal.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3>2. Are they safe enough to transport my $10,000 bike?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! In fact, they have been safety-tested by leading trade publications including this <a href=""https://gearjunkie.com/kupper-mounts-bike-carrier-suction-cup-rack-review"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GearJunkie.com product safety test review</a>.  Read it to answer all your safety-related questions.</p>
<h3>3. How do they work?</h3>
<p>Kupper Mounts utilize very powerful, vacuum-powered suction cups that have been used for many, many years by many different industries for safely securing and moving heavy and very large sheets of double-paned 1/2"" thick glass skyscraper windows, which can weigh up to 800-lb.,​ and/or stone slabs weighing more than 1,000-lbs. during the construction of skyscrapers and large buildings. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556202944/pgrzbsvu08t4jze46yni.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3>4. Have you ever seen anyone climbing a huge skyscraper on TV with vacuum-powered suction cups fall off? </h3>
<p>No. And you never will. Unlike common lick and stick suction cups used commonly in showers, the Kupper Mounts uses a special type of vacuum pump that sucks out all the air and forms a very powerful seal with approximately 450-lb. of suction power.  <br/><br/>If it can hold a 200-lb. man and keep him from falling from 40 stories up, then you should have extreme confidence that it can certainly hold a 45-lb. mountain bike, road cycle or BMX bicycle.  It even comes with a safety gauge that you can check with a 1-second glance to make sure the seal is very secure.  Not sure? Just give it a couple of pumps to create a stronger seal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556202532/v2koqv87hsqkv06usfga.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unlike common ""Suction-Cups,"" Kupper Mounts uses patented ""Vacuum-Cup"" suction technology that creates a vacuum-powered seal using a specially engineered UV-protected rubber cup that maintains a long-lasting seal.</p>
<p>If they can be trusted to hold extremely heavy glass windows while building a 40-story skyscraper, they are guaranteed to hold up to a 45-pound bike securely going up to 90-mph and are protected with Kupper Mounts' Product Liability Insurance! </p>

<h3>5. Is there a big demand for vacuum-powered suction cup bike racks?</h3>
<p>Yes, indeed there is a huge pent up demand for these types of bike racks. Most bike racks cost around $300 to $400 per bicycle carried. And that doesn't include the price to install a luggage rack, a trailer hitch or a wide variety of safety braces and straps that are needed to secure more expensive bicycle racks that can add hundreds of dollars to the total cost of ownership.  </p>
<p>Even at the full retail price of $199 for a Kupper Mounts after the crowdfunding campaign is completed, our bike racks will still be priced more than $100 to $200 less per bike.  </p>
<p>To make things worse, more expensive bike racks secure the bike by its frame, which is bad when you load up a dirty, gritty, muddy bicycle because as you drive roads with bumps and curves these bike racks will scratch your favorite bike's fancy paint job and stickers. <br/><br/>Other bike carriers that place bicycles on trays allow bikes to bounce all around, which breaks all kinds of parts as 4 bikes stacked too close together rattle, bounce and rub on each other. If you own one of these types of bike racks you should know precisely what we mean. We know we used to own them too and got sick and tired of our bikes being damaged on road trips. </p>
<p>All bike racks add resistance to a cars airflow profile, even when there are no bikes loaded, which significantly reduces gas mileage and make your drive to and from work a noisy experience.  Bikes will always make noise when loaded. And it is a total pain in the ass to remove most bike racks due to a tangled web of straps, braces and other stuff. </p>
<p>The coolest thing about Kupper Mounts bike racks is that they install in less than 120-seconds and can be removed even quicker. So instead of worrying about someone stealing your bike rack while your riding, you can simply take our bike rack off and store it safely in the trunk so you don't have worry while you're out riding. <br/><br/>In fact, according to a Analytical Research Cognizance (ARC) industry research report, vacuum-powered, suction-cup bike racks are the fastest growing segment of the automobile bike rack industry because they don't need a luggage rack or trailer hitch and can be installed on any rental car, SUV or truck and are small enough to be used for airline travel with bicycles!</p>

<h3>6. How does Kupper Mounts stack up to the competition?</h3>
<div>Here is a cool graphic we put together for a some trade publication's product reviews. As you'll see Kupper Mounts will win every time based on its engineering design's features and benefits. <br/> </div>
<div>Even more important is the price. Don't you get sick of having to shell out $500 plus accessories for a bike rack?? We did. It is one of the main reasons we invented the Kupper Mount bike rack in the first place. Instead, we offer a bike rack that is simple, compact, easy-to-clean, easy-to-store when not in use, easy-to-install/remove from your vehicle and doesn't make a lot of noise compared to other bike racks. And it doesn't damage your bike on bumpy roads because it only touches the forks and the back wheel rim. </div>

<p><i>“Other bike rack systems I looked at required complicated installation and vehicle modifications and were over $400. The Kupper Mount solved all of my problems and at only $99“</i> — Bob Jones. Mountain Bike Enthusiast.</p>
<p><i>“We test and review products on a daily basis. The Kupper Mount system really stood out not only for its ease of use, but its budget friendly price point“</i> — Bill Smith. Cycling Gear News Blog</p>
<p><i>“I didn't want a rack system that was permanently installed on my new car, so the Kupper Mount was the perfect solution!“</i> — Sally Jennings. Amateur Road Bike Racer</p>

<p><i>“The perfect bike rack system for anyone on a budget, or anyone looking for a quick and easy way to mount a road or mountain bike on your car without adding costly and complicated traditional rack system.“</i> — Lisa Pohen</p>
<p><i>“The Kupper Mount was the perfect addition to my cycling travel gear bag. Even though I already own a complete Yakima roof rack system, I frequently grab my Kupper when I want to carry an additional bike or when traveling with a friend. I also bring it in my carry on luggage when traveling and renting a car since they rarely include bike racks“</i> — Robert Harris</p>
<p><i>“When I first received the Kupper Mount I was completely shocked by the build quality of this bike rack. Its constructed from the highest quality components. The front mount is the size of a big frisbee! Upon mounting it on my vehicle, I hung my body weight from it and it didn’t budge even slightly. Its very fast to install and remove. This will be invaluable when I’m traveling with rental cars since they never include a bike rack.”</i> — Jeff Brown.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Kupper Mounts utilizes a manual vacuum pump that removes air from between the rubber pad and the contact surface; a red line on the pump's plunger serves as a vacuum indicator; a check valve allows the user to re-pump the cup without removing it from the contact surface; and a release mechanism allows the cup to disengage completely. </p>
<p>Use the cup on clean, relatively smooth, nonporous surfaces, at temperatures from 10° to 120° Fahrenheit [-12° to 49° Celsius]. Moisture or contaminants can reduce the slip resistance of the cup. The red-line indicator may not perform reliably at elevations above 5,000 feet [1524 meters]. When traveling above 5,000 feet monitor red-line indicator at regular intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Warnings: </strong><br/>• Do not place the cup face against surfaces which could damage the sealing <br/>edges. <br/>• Avoid conditions that could cause the cup to slip or to disengage <br/>prematurely, such as: contaminants, cuts or scratches in the cup face or contact surface; applying the cup to porous materials; or applying pressure against the cup edge. <br/>• Do not use the cup to transport bikes when the red line is visible. If the red line reappears frequently, discontinue use and replace rubber suction cup.</p>

2nd Step - Watch this Fast, Easy, 2-Minute Kupper Mount Installation  (1:29 minute video)

 
1. What are we selling? 
Kupper Mounts Suction Cup, Vacuum-Powered Bike Racks!

 
2. Are they safe enough to transport my $10,000 bike?
Absolutely! In fact, they have been safety-tested by leading trade publications including this GearJunkie.com product safety test review.  Read it to answer all your safety-related questions.
3. How do they work?
Kupper Mounts utilize very powerful, vacuum-powered suction cups that have been used for many, many years by many different industries for safely securing and moving heavy and very large sheets of double-paned 1/2"" thick glass skyscraper windows, which can weigh up to 800-lb.,​ and/or stone slabs weighing more than 1,000-lbs. during the construction of skyscrapers and large buildings.  
4. Have you ever seen anyone climbing a huge skyscraper on TV with vacuum-powered suction cups fall off? 
No. And you never will. Unlike common lick and stick suction cups used commonly in showers, the Kupper Mounts uses a special type of vacuum pump that sucks out all the air and forms a very powerful seal with approximately 450-lb. of suction power.  If it can hold a 200-lb. man and keep him from falling from 40 stories up, then you should have extreme confidence that it can certainly hold a 45-lb. mountain bike, road cycle or BMX bicycle.  It even comes with a safety gauge that you can check with a 1-second glance to make sure the seal is very secure.  Not sure? Just give it a couple of pumps to create a stronger seal.

Unlike common ""Suction-Cups,"" Kupper Mounts uses patented ""Vacuum-Cup"" suction technology that creates a vacuum-powered seal using a specially engineered UV-protected rubber cup that maintains a long-lasting seal.
If they can be trusted to hold extremely heavy glass windows while building a 40-story skyscraper, they are guaranteed to hold up to a 45-pound bike securely going up to 90-mph and are protected with Kupper Mounts' Product Liability Insurance! 
All of our Kupper Mounts bike racks are 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed!

Skeptical? Read this ""In-depth GearJunkie Safety Test"" of Vacuum-Powered Suction Cups
5. Is there a big demand for vacuum-powered suction cup bike racks?
Yes, indeed there is a huge pent up demand for these types of bike racks. Most bike racks cost around $300 to $400 per bicycle carried. And that doesn't include the price to install a luggage rack, a trailer hitch or a wide variety of safety braces and straps that are needed to secure more expensive bicycle racks that can add hundreds of dollars to the total cost of ownership.  
Even at the full retail price of $199 for a Kupper Mounts after the crowdfunding campaign is completed, our bike racks will still be priced more than $100 to $200 less per bike.  
To make things worse, more expensive bike racks secure the bike by its frame, which is bad when you load up a dirty, gritty, muddy bicycle because as you drive roads with bumps and curves these bike racks will scratch your favorite bike's fancy paint job and stickers. Other bike carriers that place bicycles on trays allow bikes to bounce all around, which breaks all kinds of parts as 4 bikes stacked too close together rattle, bounce and rub on each other. If you own one of these types of bike racks you should know precisely what we mean. We know we used to own them too and got sick and tired of our bikes being damaged on road trips. 
All bike racks add resistance to a cars airflow profile, even when there are no bikes loaded, which significantly reduces gas mileage and make your drive to and from work a noisy experience.  Bikes will always make noise when loaded. And it is a total pain in the ass to remove most bike racks due to a tangled web of straps, braces and other stuff. 
The coolest thing about Kupper Mounts bike racks is that they install in less than 120-seconds and can be removed even quicker. So instead of worrying about someone stealing your bike rack while your riding, you can simply take our bike rack off and store it safely in the trunk so you don't have worry while you're out riding. In fact, according to a Analytical Research Cognizance (ARC) industry research report, vacuum-powered, suction-cup bike racks are the fastest growing segment of the automobile bike rack industry because they don't need a luggage rack or trailer hitch and can be installed on any rental car, SUV or truck and are small enough to be used for airline travel with bicycles!

 

Kupper Bike Rack Mounts are one of the smallest, compact, portable, secure, convenient, easy to travel with & quick-to-install bike carriers in the world! No luggage rack or trailer hitch required.
6. How does Kupper Mounts stack up to the competition?
Here is a cool graphic we put together for a some trade publication's product reviews. As you'll see Kupper Mounts will win every time based on its engineering design's features and benefits.  
Even more important is the price. Don't you get sick of having to shell out $500 plus accessories for a bike rack?? We did. It is one of the main reasons we invented the Kupper Mount bike rack in the first place. Instead, we offer a bike rack that is simple, compact, easy-to-clean, easy-to-store when not in use, easy-to-install/remove from your vehicle and doesn't make a lot of noise compared to other bike racks. And it doesn't damage your bike on bumpy roads because it only touches the forks and the back wheel rim. 
 
Competitive Analysis - Kupper Mounts vs. Other Popular Bicycle Carriers 


Small Footprint. No luggage rack or trailer hitch required. Easy to Install. Mounts on Any Vehicle!

<p>But, that bike seat… </p>
<p>What about the rain, the sleet, the dirt, the sweat, and the thought of sharing your new outfit with the dude wearing short shorts? What about indoor cycling. Your butt hurts from sitting, you're adjusting your bike and sit down to wonder, why is someone's sweat on my LuLu Lemons? Definitely <i>not</i> chic.</p>
<p>Enter: <b>CitySeat</b>. A brand new cover designed for bike share programs and spin classes around the world.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Born in Brooklyn, CitySeat is a way to protect yourself and your clothing while also adding a touch of personal style. Meticulously designed by three friends—Chelsea: a fashionable but fastidious woman who loves spinning, and Colin and Hal: CitiBike-loving guys who double as design engineers with backgrounds in technical fabrics—CitySeat offers unrivaled protection from the elements in a reusable and ingenious design.</p> <p>CitySeat is constructed from a proprietary blend of stretchable, waterproof fabric designed to keep you cool, clean and dry, all while contouring perfectly to the seat’s shape and rolling into itself as a 2 x 2 pouch. CitySeats are made to perfectly fit bike share programs in New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Toronto, and Melbourne. They also fit spin bikes, and our new padded seat gives you a little extra cushion for you to tap back with comfort in style. And don’t fret, they also fit most road bikes and cruisers too! </p>
<p>So no matter where life takes you, you can be confident in your ability to RIDE ON. <br/></p>

Like the feel of fresh air on your face? Enjoy the freedom of coasting effortlessly down the street?  Prefer to spin indoors? 
But, that bike seat… 
What about the rain, the sleet, the dirt, the sweat, and the thought of sharing your new outfit with the dude wearing short shorts? What about indoor cycling. Your butt hurts from sitting, you're adjusting your bike and sit down to wonder, why is someone's sweat on my LuLu Lemons? Definitely not chic.
Enter: CitySeat. A brand new cover designed for bike share programs and spin classes around the world.



Born in Brooklyn, CitySeat is a way to protect yourself and your clothing while also adding a touch of personal style. Meticulously designed by three friends—Chelsea: a fashionable but fastidious woman who loves spinning, and Colin and Hal: CitiBike-loving guys who double as design engineers with backgrounds in technical fabrics—CitySeat offers unrivaled protection from the elements in a reusable and ingenious design. CitySeat is constructed from a proprietary blend of stretchable, waterproof fabric designed to keep you cool, clean and dry, all while contouring perfectly to the seat’s shape and rolling into itself as a 2 x 2 pouch. CitySeats are made to perfectly fit bike share programs in New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Toronto, and Melbourne. They also fit spin bikes, and our new padded seat gives you a little extra cushion for you to tap back with comfort in style. And don’t fret, they also fit most road bikes and cruisers too! 
So no matter where life takes you, you can be confident in your ability to RIDE ON. 



We're hoping to expand and begin prototyping other products that will help improve bike share programs and spin classes around the world. We need your help to really put us on the map! Since our launch in October 2014, we've been entirely self funded and most of our money has gone to prototyping, materials, and labor.
So, Fund On, friends, and leave the plastic bag seat cover at home.

   What We Need & What You Get 
We're looking for $30,000 in order to refine our prototyping, source a range of fabrics, and begin producing in the kind of bulk which bike share systems demand! 
By having some extra material around, we'll be able to get to work sooner on refining new products and getting them to market as quickly as the requests are coming in.   We'd also like to do a widespread marketing campaign. At this point, almost every major city in the United States has a bike share program and we want to make sure they're aware of what CitySeat has to offer!  While you're at it, wear a hat, tank or tee to rep us wherever you go! 



Although we're confident in the Indiegogo community's ability to get behind this idea, if we don't reach our goal, we'll divide the funds equally between product development, fabric sourcing, and our marketing campaign. At the end of the day, we're just a group of young people with big ideas and we need your help to make this a reality! 

We have all new patterns that will be specially pre-released for YOU, our supporters! Be one of the first to get our new patterns so you can RIDE ON and stay dry! 

We want you to be the first people to test our our padded bike seats! We have made a product that remains waterproof and printable, but now it's a 2.0 version with a removable pad so you can bike share to your spin class and get a little extra cush for the tush.  

 
   The Impact The only thing we love more than a fresh bike seat is the feeling of satisfaction we get from knowing that CitySeat is helping do more than just keep people fashionable and dry. 
BikeShares are an invaluable part of the movement to bring cities into accord with green principles! They promote healthy lifestyles, reduce our carbon footprint—and much of the time they're also more convenient! Above all, CitySeat is a tool meant to enable people take advantage of all the benefits these programs have to offer.
Not content with just the environmental impact alone, we have been and continue to donate a percentage of sales to Recycle-a-Bicycle, the New York non-profit that “fosters youth development, environmental education, community engagement, and healthy living.” 
So, the more money we're able to raise, the better our products will be, the more innovations we can roll out, and the faster we'll handle large orders! All of which, of course, is to the benefit of the environment as a whole, and charities like Recycle-a-Bicycle specifically!



   Risks & Challenges
As much as we believe in the power and potential of CitySeat, we're also realistic about the challenges we face. Thus far, one of our greatest hurdles has been the sourcing and fabrication of materials while keeping the integrity of our product fully made in America. The idea of a bike seat cover is as old as the dingy plastic bag itself, so we knew that our value had to come from superior construction and manufacture. It's why we've pushed ourselves tirelessly to work only with the best Italian fabrics, which allow us to produce beautiful products which satisfy all the functional requirements. These high standards, however, have at times made it challenging to continue to grow independently, and we're realistic about the role that proper funding will play in allowing us to heighten efficiency without compromising quality whatsoever. We're also keenly aware of the limitations we face in spreading the word of CitySeat. The press we've generated thus far has been amazing ranging from The New York Times to Good Housekeeping, and the customer feedback is what keeps us going! But at the end of the day, we need to make sure that people know about us, and the self-funded model is simply not equipped to handle the marketing demands we face. Nothing breaks our heart more than to see someone riding around with a wet plastic bag on their seat, simply because they've never heard of us!These challenges are real, but we're confident that with your help, we can continue to not only make the best possible products, create innovative products, but to ensure that everyone who needs a CitySeat knows where to look!

evaluation that will take place at a  conference held at Motorland Aragón.
Participants will work in teams, competing with a limited budget and timeline
to complete, over a period of three semesters, the design and prototype. The final

We will deliver an Android app for mobile phones that will help uni students get to and from their daily lectures without worrying about finding parking spaces.


The Impact
It is envisaged that the impact will be noticeable as the campus is all around downtown Limassol and there is currently huge pressure in finding parking. If students engage with the app, to a large extent the challenge can be addressed.

Risks & Challenges

The main risk we have is to raise the target amount within the limited timescale we have.
Testing the app within the same limited timescale is also a challenge.

<p>Carbon fiber, the majority of the bicycle is manufactured out of carbon fiber, an aerospace material ten times lighter than steel while retaining the strength equal to steel. It is manufactured as an ultralight weight bike and within the category “long lasting”, with an approximate weight of 7,5kg, making it easier to transport and store. This makes it ideal for using with public transportation or easily fitting in a vehicle’s trunk, while maintaining the agility of a modern bicycle. </p>

</ul></div>","Designed with a large costumer base in mind, from teenagers through adults,  the bicycle distinguishes itself due to its innovative characteristics.

Carbon fiber, the majority of the bicycle is manufactured out of carbon fiber, an aerospace material ten times lighter than steel while retaining the strength equal to steel. It is manufactured as an ultralight weight bike and within the category “long lasting”, with an approximate weight of 7,5kg, making it easier to transport and store. This makes it ideal for using with public transportation or easily fitting in a vehicle’s trunk, while maintaining the agility of a modern bicycle. 

Tires, equipped with tires made of a new material that does not contain air, these tires emulate the experience of a standard tire, but they do not pop or require pumping, reinforcing the idea of zero maintenance. 

Belt, utilizes the transmission system “Gates Carbon Drive”, a serrated belt which is reinforced with carbon fiber. The belt does not require oiling or any maintenance whatsoever (since it is not a chain). It does not create stains or attaches to clothing, and is completely silent and reliable.


VCU (VIKA Central Unit), The heart of the bicycle. It houses the GPS, Bluetooth, the battery, accelerometer, and various sensors. 

Autonomous charging system, a system that charges itself and feeds the VCU. It charges as you ride your VIKA without diminishing its riding performance.

The lighting system turns on as the user enters its Bluetooth radius and turns off automatically as one walks away from it. Its sensor is also the perfect compliment to foggy days or traveling through tunnels or sudden dark paths as it turns on automatically.

The Model ZERO includes integrated LED lighting in both the front and rear. When you press the breaks on your VIKA, the accelerometer ignites the rear break light with greater intensity. The front lights utilize special optics that light up the path.

Internal cabling, the entire cabling system- brakes, transmission, and electronics- travel exclusively inside the frame preserving maximum aesthetic of design and ultimate conservation of the cables.

Foldability, a completely new system of folding that is simple, quick, and easy to maneuver. The purity of the lines in the frame are achieved thanks to a one-of-a-kind system of hidden hinges developed by VIKA. It consists of electrical contacts capable of replacing cables to transport energy, this enabling the folding to be efficient and easy.


























VIKA was created 3 years ago as a response to the lack of top gamut foldable bicycles in the market. We began working on the project by focusing on design, technology, innovative components (in order to arrive at a functional yet luxurious ride).

</div></div>","Summary 

StickieBalls are vehicle mounting kits for mobile
devices that can be used with any mobile phone, tablet, GPS, Kindle or other mobile
device. The StickieBalls  mission is to provide a safe, effective and inexpensive way for drivers to secure their phones and other devices while driving, yet still give hands-free access for receiving calls.


SmartWeb Mobile hopes to use the IndieGoGo campaign to increase awareness of the texting-while-driving epidemic. It's a worldwide problem, but here are the sad statistics for American drivers:
TEXTING WHILE DRIVING CAUSES…
> 1,600,000 accidents per year – National Safety Council> 330,000 injuries per year – Harvard Center for Risk Analysis Study> 11 teen deaths EVERY DAY – Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Fatality Facts> Nearly 25% of ALL car accidents. That’s ONE in FOUR!
Together we can help prevent texting-while-driving accidents by providing a simple solution that nearly any driver can afford.
My Own Experience
This may have happened to you also. When driving recently I was forced to slam on my brakes and swerve to avoid a careless texting driver who had drifted into my lane. As a result of that screeching near-miss my mobile phone, which was lying loose on the center console, was launched into the dash and ended up in the floorboard. Not good. So I went about finding a better way to secure my phone in the car and still have it within reach if needed.
  
Introducing StickieBalls. 
 Keeps you AND your phone safer while driving. Help us reduce the number of phone-related traffic collisions.

Please, please, please don’t text and drive!


It’s not just about texting while driving. It’s also about having a loose cell phone sliding around on the seat or the dashboard, distracting the driver and causing an unsafe situation. StickieBalls are a simple, inexpensive fix to avoid a lot of vehicle crashes and needless highway carnage. We hope drivers will support our IndieGoGo campaign and learn how they can help make our roadways safer for everyone.

For our Supporters:

StickieBalls are
precision engineered for durability. In our testing, the first thing users
noticed when they opened the box was just how heavy the StickieBall was. The chrome plated ball housed in its plastic pedestal is over an inch
in diameter and is forged of solid steel. The magnetic rotating disk is precision
machined out of a solid block of stainless steel and is encased in hardened plastic.


The StickieBall pedestal is firmly anchored to the vehicle by industrial strength 3M Brand tape. The StickieBall Universal Safety Kit comes with two metal disks for the
back of your devices so you can attach either of two different devices to the magnetic
base. It also comes with an additional 3M tape disk and a handy alcohol-wipe to clean
the surface before you attach the base to the surface and the disk(s) to the device(s). Additional metal disks are available in a StickieBall
Spare Parts Kit.
Focus groups were consulted to test the
merits of StickieBalls. Several ideas and suggestions came from that testing, such as using
StickieBalls on the side of a cabinet in the kitchen; affixing StickieBalls to
the side of computer monitors, placing a ‘Kindle’ out of reach of little ones
but still allowing video viewing; adding a video screen to the rear seats of
the family SUV; attaching a phone to a wheelchair or other mobility device; attaching a TV remote. You will undoubtedly find more uses for StickieBalls. We'd love to hear your suggestions!


 What We Need & What You Get
 The funding will be used for initial parts inventory, assembly, product packaging and social media campaigns. These campaigns will draw attention to the issue and raise awareness of what is becoming an epidemic among younger drivers.  Our supporters will have a variety of Perks available to them. Early Bird Supporters who pledge their support prior to October 15, 2015 will receive a complete StickieBalls Universal Safety Kit at a $5 Discount from the Retail price after the Campaign ends. Recognizing that many people will find multiple uses for StickieBalls, we have created a 2-Pak, a 5-Pak and a 10-Pak of StickieBalls Kits, all at discounted prices on IndieGoGo. You can review all of your Perks right on this page.

  Risks & Challenges StickieBalls are here in limited quantities right now. Our IndieGoGo Campaign will provide the needed capital to expand production to meet the forecasted demand. With the Holidays just around the corner we believe our supporters will want to make gifts of StickieBalls to family members,  loved ones and others they care about. Our funding goals are very modest. We have enough inventory to meet all orders up to our goal,  so there is no financial risk to early supporters if our goal is not reached. You WILL receive your StickieBalls.

PROJECT <br/>WELCOME - YOU CAN HELP US FLY</h2><p>With your support we can build our first flying Jinker. </p><p>What was once a dream is now a part-complete flying wing prototype, designed to take flight under human power and deliver a remarkably efficient form of flight. An original idea of Niko Pietrek who drew his inspiration from birds and experiments with zeppelins among others will become reality. Wings can serve to translate both lift and fall of the pilot´s body acceleration into travelling motion.</p><p>We will use your support to finish our first full scale competition ready flying wing.<br/>The team has thus far built the first Jinker wing and now requires support to perform the inevitable tests and trimming for safety reasons. We will be conducting several experimental tests and first flights with a pilot throughout the following months. </p><p>By purchasing our perks you will be helping us complete the Jinker, and primarily with the following : </p><ul>
<li>Transport to the flying field for testing and flight trials</li>
<li>Pilot training </li>
<li>Composite Carbon Fiber for the cockpit, rudders and tail</li>
</ul><p>If we oversubscribe we will use the additional funds to begin building a second Jinker and to begin our preperations for the world record and Kremer Prize Sports. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://jinker.de/images/gifs/JinkerFlightGif.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490013949/xixir7mddevlf2qeyr2o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>THE JINKER PERKS</h2><p>We have put together a comprehensive range of perks, which allow us to return something back and to say thank you for your generous support.

Only if the pilot needs to accelerate or to gain altitude he/she needs to jump. Most probably in real life the flapping phases will be much shorter than the gliding phases, except you are participating in a sports competition whose winner is the fastest on a defined track.</p><p><strong>2: How will the Jinker be maneuvered?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">Both by moving the body into any desired direction and thus changing the center of gravity like you see it with delta wings, and also with the help of small ailerons on the tip of the wings and the rear pitch elevator</p><p><strong>3: How fast will the Jinker fly?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This is difficult to predict, but basically we expect flight speeds between 40Km/h and 60Km/h, depending on each singular flight situation. All in all the Jinker will not be very fast.</p><p><strong>4: Is the Jinker safe?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">Yes, safety has been one main aspect throughout the development of the Jinker. The concept provides that at any convenient time point the pilot can stop all jumping and maneuvering and then the Jinker will be a regular glider. This is possible because the wings are fixed to the cockpit and no hinges or other moving parts are involved. Additionally the pilot will always wear a parachute.</p><p><strong>5: Have you proved the concept with a scale model?</strong></p><p>             No, for three reasons.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">  A: The effort to build a model was considered to be as high as the effort to build a    1:1 Jinker prototype.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">  B: How can we tailor the model to react to turbulences? We cannot. All we can do is teach   the model to fly under very specific and limited conditions.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">C: This means that we cannot learn anything from a model, but that we have to teach the model to do something that we really do not fully understand yet. Don´t forget that nobody has ever done something like this before!</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Most importantly though is the fact that a pilot can feel the actions and reactions of the Jinker and he will be able to use all his senses to deal with it. A pilot will use his intuitive and anticipative skills to fly the Jinker according to the individual situation and report about it. So we will be able to learn from the pilot and improve the Jinker much more efficiently until we reach a flight quality level which is predictable and repeatable.</p><p><strong>6: Can I buy a Jinker?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">In the future yes, but you have to understand that for safety reasons there have to be organized structures available like in any popular sports. Most probably you will become a member in a Jinker club, association or academy and go through a series of training sessions. We plan to build a 2 persons Jinker for the purpose of training. This will be important in order to have safe conditions, a high level of technical quality, predictable conditions and lots of shared experiences in the Jinker community all around the world.</p><p><strong>7: How expensive will a Jinker be?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">As you can see, the Jinker is a very simple construction with only a few basic parts which are not so complicated to build once the final design is in place and you have repeatable processes. We cannot state any precise figure right now, but for sure it will be affordable for any average person. It is a bit early to mention this but part of our concept provides that in future real life you may only have to buy specific parts of the Jinker that match to your individual weight/size ratio, like the fuselage of the wings.</p><p><strong>8: How does the Jinker take off?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">To take off with the Jniker will be as easy as taking off with a paraglider or a delta wing. It will be carried to a ramp or hill, from which the pilot will jump. After a gliding phase to gain speed, the pilot will gently start to jump in order to induce the flapping of the wings. It will also be possible to let the Jinker be towed up to speed like a regular glider.</p><p><strong>9: What about the landing?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">It was extremely important to design and build the Jinker as light as possible. Therefore all parts have a double function and no heavy landing wheels are incorporated. The base on which the pilot stands will be shaped like a surf board and serve as landing means. Because the nose of the Jinker has to look upwards during the landing phase, the tail of the Jinker must be placed quite high in order to not interfere.</p><p><strong>10: Can anyone fly a Jinker?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">Basically yes. It will be necessary though to be trained and to eventually get a sort of license. This is due to safety and regulatory standards to be accomplished. Don´t forget that as a Jinker pilot you will be participating on air traffic! The authorities make a big difference between active and passive airplanes, the Jinker being an active one. Depending on the purpose of your envolvement in a Jinker academy or club, the training will most probably even incorporate lessons for meteorology and radio transmission in order to capacitate you to reach whatever location and/or flight duration safely.</p><p><strong>11: Is there a weight limit for a Jinker pilot?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">Not as long as you are healthy and fit. It will be important though to have a Jinker suitable to your individual weight. The Jinker for a heavy pilot will therefore be slightly larger than for a light one in terms of wing surface. There will also be different Jinker configurations available depending on the type of flight you want to perform like endurance or racing. For an endurance flight the wings will most probably be longer and slimmer, and so forth. These are all things we have to find out while we bring the Jinker to perfection and collect experience.</p><p><strong>12: How high can I fly with a Jinker?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">Good question! I can´t really know this yet, but I cannot think of a good reason why you should not be able to fly as high as a paraglider under the same conditions. The only prediction I can make is that after a comparable start you will be able to climb and/or maintain the initial altitude as long as you are fit enough to jump! In many cases the Jinker will carry you to reach an up wind, when a paraglider may fail due to the lack of altitude!</p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;""> </p><p><strong>13: Will there be different Jinker models available?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">Yes. We are for example planning a Jinker for two persons as a future training platform. For the time being our first aim has to be to bring the actual version to a point where we can perform predictable and safe flights. At the time we reach the public we will need to offer different Jinker configurations to suit each individual pilot´s physical condition in terms of weight, size and fitness. There will also be different configurations available for racing competitions, endurance competitions, enjoyable cruising flights, etc.. The more experience we gain, the better we will be able to fulfill the different expectations.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;""> </p><p><strong>14: When will the Jinker be available to the public?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.25pt;"">You have to consider that we are introducing a completely new and revolutionary flying apparatus. Our first aim is to set a new world record and subsequently win the Kremer Prize Sports. The latter is an unconditional step towards making the Jinker popular. We are totally committed to accomplish both aims within this year. The rest of the path depends on our level of success and the level of support we get, both from the public and the authorities. It is predictable though that we will have to work hard to achieve a public availability for the next couple of years…</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490013949/xixir7mddevlf2qeyr2o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>SOCIAL MEDIA GRAPHICS FOR SHARING</h2><p>Please share the graphics below:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490959077/sgyqb1mnctynkpxzsazm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490959100/vkgsguaray1dfcrwljbm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490959134/zpa07onu2dp8vb8wpvkt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490013949/xixir7mddevlf2qeyr2o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p></div>","THE J.IN.K.E.R. PROJECT WELCOME - YOU CAN HELP US FLYWith your support we can build our first flying Jinker. What was once a dream is now a part-complete flying wing prototype, designed to take flight under human power and deliver a remarkably efficient form of flight. An original idea of Niko Pietrek who drew his inspiration from birds and experiments with zeppelins among others will become reality. Wings can serve to translate both lift and fall of the pilot´s body acceleration into travelling motion.We will use your support to finish our first full scale competition ready flying wing.The team has thus far built the first Jinker wing and now requires support to perform the inevitable tests and trimming for safety reasons. We will be conducting several experimental tests and first flights with a pilot throughout the following months. By purchasing our perks you will be helping us complete the Jinker, and primarily with the following : 
Transport to the flying field for testing and flight trials
Pilot training 
Composite Carbon Fiber for the cockpit, rudders and tail
If we oversubscribe we will use the additional funds to begin building a second Jinker and to begin our preperations for the world record and Kremer Prize Sports.   THE JINKER PERKSWe have put together a comprehensive range of perks, which allow us to return something back and to say thank you for your generous support. Our merchandise is made from high quality materials and wherever possible responsibly sourced from sustainable sources. We hope that you will help us raise awareness by posting our fund page on social media.  THE CORE JINKER TEAM      THE JINKER WING & CONSTRUCTIONThe Jinker wing is a light portable flight apparatus with a semi-round fuselage, a flexible frame and downwards-curved fixed wings. The wings are pre-loaded such that they are horizontal in level flight and provide the necessary rebound effect in flapping motion. The general construction is carbon fibre spars and booms with a flexible yet aerodynamic wing covering. This is required to achieve the correct torsional strength while allowing for a very dynamic wing surface flex both on top and bottom. JINKER FLYING WING PRINCIPLEThe Jinker ornithopter is started against the wind from an elevated place like a ramp or a hill. The pilot runs towards the wind until the ornithopter is carried by the airflow. He then jumps from behind onto the frame, which is open in the rear and he starts to glide first.After that, the pilot initiates the flapping of the wings by gently jumping on the plane and slowly and rhythmically increasing the body acceleration and frequency.The image below illustrates the flapping and flying motion. HISTORY OF FLYING FLAPPING WINGSFor hundreds of years man has tried to produce a flying wing that is capable of flight similar to that of a bird. Records of designs have come from all regions of the world and all sorts of cultures but most notably from the following: 1500 Leonardo DaVinci. The Italian genius and visionary designed a Flapping Wing Machine which he called “Ornithopter”. This word creation has been established as official nomenclature for a Flying Machine with Flapping Wings within the community.1789 Asato Shiushio. This aeronautical pioneer was highly honored by the local emperor of Okinawa Island for his successful flight with his flapping wing construction made of bamboo and textile featherwork.1894 Otto Lilienthal. The modern aeronautical pioneer built and tested several prototypes with flapping wing technology. Unfortunately he died during one of the flight attempts.1942 Adalbert Schmid. He built and successfully tested a motorized ornithopter, which was featured with one fixed wing for continuous lift generation and with one pair of flapping wings for propulsion.2010 Todd Reichert. The enormous effort of Todd Reichert and his Canadian Team culminated in the attempt to perform and document the first successful sustained flight with a human powered ornithopter! For the first time in history a human powered ornithopter could maintain the initial flight altitude for the duration of 19,3sec! He and his “Snowbird” are the actual world record holders!JINKER FEASIBILITY STUDY  A highly detailed and lengthy feasibility study was conducted by the well-respected Professor  Dipl.-Ing. R. Voit–Nitschmann from IFB in Stuttgart, Germany, who concluded in his report that the concept of a flying wing with a human being as an energy source is not just feasible but indeed able to fullfill a sustained and climbing flight, provided the prescribed means of jumping is used to induce a rebound effect on the wings and thus forward air speed.Quote: “For a flight with about 2m/s climb speed and assumed 100% pilot efficiency 46km/h average airspeed is required for a Jinker with 15m spanwidth.”                The full feasibility study can be downloaded here: www.jinker.de/documents/feasability/JINKER-Proo... Prof. Dipl.-Ing. R. Voit–NitschmannSFL GmbH Baumwiesenweg 6b70569 StuttgartGermanyJINKER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYThe Jinker is a patented design, based on the originality of the wing shape form and function and the ability of the pilot to induce flapping of the wings causing forward speed and thus in turn lift. The full patent can be downloaded or viewed from the links below and we welcome any thoughts or feedback. An English version of the patent can be made available upon request.The Jinker has a multi-region patent and can be viewed here:www.jinker.de/documents/patent/WO002009074349A2...The Jinker has a multi-region patent and can be downloaded here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHpnWFHp_W8 RISKS & TECHNICAL CHALLENGESEngineeringThe complexity of designing a fixed and flexible wing is compounded by the fact that the Jinker wing needs to keep the shape of the profiles while flapping. Piloting The pilots will need to become well suited to the Jinker energy motion output likely requiring specialist training. The fact that the pilot is much heavier than the Jinker will require a change of mind set, meaning that he is not a passenger, but that he carries the Jinker with him!Materials While carbon fibre is the primary material we feel that more work still needs to be done on the preformed sections and in experimenting with new and lighter weight composites such as graphene.Construction Construction is challenging, and requires some skill which we feel well adapted to, however the final most efficient form will require some refinement over time, based on the testing experience.OUR PLANNED ACHIEVEMENTS

It's Time To Upgrade Your Board
Plug and play 
Convert your current board with a simple installation. Keeping your own trucks while your board can not only serve as the best form of personal transportation, but also longboarding / Skateboarding after unloading the kit.

Replace your rear truck with the power wheel set 
Replace the original truck with the power wheel set of FUNING-BOARD, and it will become a traditional four-wheel electric skateboard which can replace batteries.

 
DIY Your Own Custom Board
FUNING BOARD consists of remote control, power wheel & suspension parts, battery control unit and connector.
The connector only weighs 100g so it can be placed on board all the time.
Power wheel & suspension parts and battery control unit are connected by buckles which is very convenient for disassembly and assembly.
The power battery is replaceable, so that you can purchase more batteries if you need.

 
We want you to feel awesome, so we're not using single motor powertrain.
Motor: 2 x 800 W

 
High quality 18x LG lithium cells with a built-in Battery Management System(BMS)
Cruising range: 12miles

But what about urban bicycles? Why in this sector almost all the frames and components are still made of steel or, at most, aluminum? The answer, as usual, is found on the price. Making a carbon fiber frame with traditional methods is very expensive, for the materials and also for the design and production process. While making a traditional one in steel, it is a much simpler and cheaper work. Under this scene, it is easy to understand why carbon has not been introduced into the urban world.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> With carbon fiber we can obtain the same, or even better, mechanical characteristics than in a piece made of steel, but with a weight five or six times less.

These are the color combinations we have chosen for you.  EXTRASIn addition to everything we have told you, our bikes incorporate several accessories and components that make it the ultimate urban bicycle.REAR LED LIGHTAll models have LED taillight integrated into the frame itself. It is charged by USB connection, it is easily removable to prevent theft, it has 50 hours of autonomy, waterproof and several modes of operation, among those that stand out the braking sensor that increases the intensity of the lighting when it detects a deceleration.TANNUS TIRESIf you are tired of having to change wheels due to inconvenient punctures or if you simply want to forget forever of having to inflate the wheels of your bike, we offer you the option of incorporating Tannus tires. There are even lighter than conventional camera and cover solutions and you can choose from a wide variety of colors. Forget about problems and maintenance for more than 6,000 kilometers and ride without worries with a total grip, both dry and wet, thanks to its innovative Aither® material  BIKONE BOTTOM BRACKETIn collaboration with the Spanish company BIKONE BEARINGS we incorporate in all our frames its innovative technology in the bottom brackets that are exclusively manufactured for Cyclic, that ensure the best behavior, without noise or cracking and with surprising lightness and durability. 3 SPEED INTERNAL HUBIf the slopes are not your thing and you want to ride comfortably, we offer you the possibility of incorporating a three-speed internal hub integrated in the rear axle. You will keep all the urban aesthetics of your Cyclic and there will be no ramp that resists you.  CYCLIC IS TECHNOLOGYIn competitive cycling, carbon fiber began to be introduced in the frames, and in other components such as forks and handlebars. But what about urban bicycles? Why in this sector almost all the frames and components are still made of steel or, at most, aluminum? The answer, as usual, is found on the price. Making a carbon fiber frame with traditional methods is very expensive, for the materials and also for the design and production process. While making a traditional one in steel, it is a much simpler and cheaper work. Under this scene, it is easy to understand why carbon has not been introduced into the urban world. With carbon fiber we can obtain the same, or even better, mechanical characteristics than in a piece made of steel, but with a weight five or six times less. That is, maximum strength and rigidity, but very lightly. For the realization of the prototypes and of the definitive designs, we have invested many hours of calculation and development, using the most advanced simulation techniques and following the rules that regulate the main cases of load in use of a bicycle. CYCLIC IS ENVIRONMENT At Cyclic, we are committed with the environment and we did not want to keep our bike as a simple element of sustainable urban mobility. Thanks to the exclusive manufacturing system, we managed to boost local production and achieve a production process close to zero CO2 emissions. The carbon footprint of a Cyclic frame is practically zero since, on one hand, we eliminate the emissions associated with import and transoceanic transport and, on the other, energy consumption and the generation of waste associated with the production process is almost residual in comparison with traditional methods. WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR WITH THIS CAMPAIGN?It is very simple, on one hand, we want to make ourselves known and give the opportunity to our first followers to have a totally innovative and customized urban bicycle for an absolutely unbeatable price. On the other, we need your help to start the project at an industrial level due to we need financing to acquire the molds that allow us to manufacture high-quality customized frames, with little effort. FUNDINGOur exclusive and patented modular manufacturing system allows us to produce fully customized frames in size, extremely light and resistant, in an agile and sustainable way, not only to stress, but also to the corrosion produced by water and moisture by not carrying metallic components.The current prototypes have been manufactured using 3D printing techniques and additive manufacturing and, although the result has been amazing, its high cost prevents the final production process through such techniques.In order for the joining parts of the tubes that make up the complete frame to have the necessary quality and strength, we need to manufacture them by means of an injection process of a carbon fiber composite material specially designed for us. That’s why, we need a series of molds that are the primary object of our investment. THE TEAM We are a dynamic and flexible team with diverse and complementary capabilities, but with one thing in common: the illusion for this project. We don't want to be just another company that sells bicycles, we want to create a community, see the streets full of bikes and think that we are having an impact on the world around us.Daniel RodríguezFormer professional athlete with more than 15 years of career.

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>London Electric Cars is a start-up run out of a small garage in central London.</p>
<p>It was started in 2017 by Matthew Quitter after he got fed up with the air quality and cost of petrol in London. He has a passion for classic cars and was excited by classic car EV conversions but soon discovered that they are expensive.</p>
<p>So Matthew set up LEC to figure out a way to bring down the cost of classic conversions.  However, he realised that if he could get conversion costs low enough, they would offer a solution not just for classic cars but for all vehicles.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use second hand EV components salvaged from the most popular electric cars to deliver affordable conversions.</p>
<p>We also want to develop conversion kits to enable local garages and home mechanics to easily convert cars to electric.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541475866/rm7fvouwfi2adaixu1a8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Development work is done mostly by Matthew but he is regularly joined by some great volunteers. He also benefits from sharing space with a local classic car club and is lucky to have the support of many Morris Minor enthusiasts, as well as the wider EV community.</p>
<p>We currently have space to work on four cars. We can carry out installations and develop our products. Welding, fabricating and other industrial processes are done off-site through our various suppliers.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our prototype is a 1953 Morris Minor Series 2.</span></p>
<p>We took out the combustion motor and installed batteries and a suitable electric motor. All using only second hand equipment.</p>
<p>The car has been driving around London for over a year now and it’s loads of fun. It is a great short-range city car.</p>

<p>Currently we're working on five customer cars: A classic Mini, a Land Rover Series 2, a Morris Traveller, a Karmann Ghia and a Citroen H Van.</p>
<p>Based on what we learn from converting cars we've started developing conversion kits for the Morris Minor, Series Land Rovers and classic Mini.</p>
<p>We continuously seek ways to reduce the costs of conversions. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why we need your help</strong></h3>
<p>We want to hire great people, find larger premises to work on more cars, purchase equipment and increase the speed of development.</p>
<p>We need to hire some great staff. Ideally some of the recent volunteers who are talented EV fanatics and have been learning quickly. The more people working at London Electric Cars, the quicker we'll develop.</p>
<p>We have found a new, much larger space to move into, just round the corner from our existing site. With your help we'll be able to fully equip the new workshop, expand the number of cars we work on and have more space for research.</p>
<p>We want to explore the different sources of affordable EV components: Nissan Leafs  and E-NV200, BMW i3s, Renault Zoes, Kia Souls, Mitsubishi i-Mievs and Citroen Zeros etc. as well as alternative sources such as recycled computer laptop batteries, electric motors from hybrid cars or rewound industrial motors. </p>
<p>We want to continue to refine our Morris Minor kit and speed up development of our other classic car kits. From there we will pick the most common cars on the road and develop conversion kits for those.</p>
<p>We would use your supporting funds to research ways to make conversions as efficient and affordable as they can be. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>Living in London, or around any city, it’s clear that there’s a pollution problem. People should be driving electric cars, the average journey is under 6 miles and most of the journey is spent at low speeds. But buying an electric car is still expensive. </p>
<p>At the same time there are currently 1 billion combustion-powered cars, trucks and vans in the world. There are 37 million vehicles in the UK alone.</p>
<p>Nothing is really wrong with those cars except for their combustion engines. But despite that, as the world turns electric, current thinking would have them all headed for the scrap heap.</p>
<p>So why not make affordable electric cars by finding affordable electric car parts and converting old combustion engine cars.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How do you find electric car parts?</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest challenge to our plan is sourcing cheap electric car parts. To do this we’re buying salvage electric cars from breakers yards.</p>
<p>The top selling electric car in the UK is the Nissan Leaf so they’re the most commonly found electric cars in breaker’s yards.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What else are we working on?</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve had lots of interest from the Minor community and are converting a Traveller at the moment. We have produced early versions of a kit that would allow any Minor enthusiast to convert their car to electric.</p>

<p>In the garage at the moment we’ve also got a 1969 Land Rover Series 2, a 1980 Classic Mini, a Karmann Ghia and a Citroen H Van.</p>
<p>From the experience of the Minor kit we’re also working on kits for classic Mini’s and Land Rovers.</p>
<p>We’re eager to properly explore ways of using recycled laptop batteries in traction packs. </p>
<p>We also get involved in talks about electric cars, encourage young adults to come and spend time in our garage and evangelise about electric cars generally.</p>
<p>We’re also chasing the UK government for help, the OLEV for grants and we’re working to push down the price of a conversion below £10,000 for 100 miles range and rapid charging. If we could persuade the government to allow the plug in grant for conversions we could get closer to prices starting from £5,000.</p>

<p align=""left"">Breeze II has great spec compared to most of the board on the market. As mentioned in the video, it can travel 15 miles in medium mode, climb up to a 30% hill and reach up to 28 miles per hour. The chart below compares Breeze II with one of the most famous electric skateboards in the industry. Even without the factor of such a big price difference, Breeze II still has advantages on the data listed.</p>

<p>On Breeze II, hub motor is chosen over belt motor for several reasons. As most electric skateboard users know, belt motor can provide more torque which can generate higher acceleration. However, belt motor needs frequent maintenance and makes loud noise during cruising. The hub motors are quieter and more energy efficient.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566814665/zyrxddmadou93j09agng.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those motors on Breeze II are also swappable. When the outside layer wears out, you can easily change it without changing the entire motor which is much more expensive. We also include a different size spare pair of wheels in the package.</p>

<p align=""left"">For battery case and ESC case, we choose aluminum alloy to provide well crashworthiness and heat dissipation. The swappable function makes it easy to change the battery after the battery life ends. On the other hand, it also makes it possible to travel in longer distance if you carry a back-up battery during your trip.</p>

<p align=""left"">Battery is one of the most importance parts of an electric skateboard. We select high quality Samsung battery which has 1000 cycles battery life. This means you can use up the battery 1000 times but still has most capacity of your battery. In addition, the Samsung battery can bear extreme weather. Breeze II can still function from -4°F to 140°F.</p>

<p>The deck of a skateboard can have huge influence on your riding experience. Breeze II’s deck is made of bamboo and two layers of glass fiber which make the deck three times more expensive than Canada maple deck. The combination makes a balance between flexibility and strength. The shape of the deck is designed for more comfort and stability.</p>

<p>In order to prevent water damage commonly seen on our previous boards. We enhance the waterproof level on Breeze II. It has one of the best waterproof features in the market, which reaches IP67. You can immerse the board entirely in water for short time period without damage it.</p>

Breeze II has great spec compared to most of the board on the market. As mentioned in the video, it can travel 15 miles in medium mode, climb up to a 30% hill and reach up to 28 miles per hour. The chart below compares Breeze II with one of the most famous electric skateboards in the industry. Even without the factor of such a big price difference, Breeze II still has advantages on the data listed.
 

 

On Breeze II, hub motor is chosen over belt motor for several reasons. As most electric skateboard users know, belt motor can provide more torque which can generate higher acceleration. However, belt motor needs frequent maintenance and makes loud noise during cruising. The hub motors are quieter and more energy efficient.

 
Those motors on Breeze II are also swappable. When the outside layer wears out, you can easily change it without changing the entire motor which is much more expensive. We also include a different size spare pair of wheels in the package.
 

 

 
 


For battery case and ESC case, we choose aluminum alloy to provide well crashworthiness and heat dissipation. The swappable function makes it easy to change the battery after the battery life ends. On the other hand, it also makes it possible to travel in longer distance if you carry a back-up battery during your trip.
           
 

Battery is one of the most importance parts of an electric skateboard. We select high quality Samsung battery which has 1000 cycles battery life. This means you can use up the battery 1000 times but still has most capacity of your battery. In addition, the Samsung battery can bear extreme weather. Breeze II can still function from -4°F to 140°F.
 

The deck of a skateboard can have huge influence on your riding experience. Breeze II’s deck is made of bamboo and two layers of glass fiber which make the deck three times more expensive than Canada maple deck. The combination makes a balance between flexibility and strength. The shape of the deck is designed for more comfort and stability.

 

In order to prevent water damage commonly seen on our previous boards. We enhance the waterproof level on Breeze II. It has one of the best waterproof features in the market, which reaches IP67. You can immerse the board entirely in water for short time period without damage it.
 


 
After the hardware introduction here comes the software.
 

We add in slide start function considering most skater used to slide start the normal skateboard. After couple steps of sliding, the board will automatically turn on.

 

Hardness of brake setting has always been tricky to decide. Since people have different braking habits, a single level braking can cause bad cruising experience and even injury. Breeze II has 4 brake settings from soft to strong. You can adjust the setting directly on the remote control during your ride.

 

By pressing the LED button on the remote control during cruise, your can cruise at the same speed you currently at. This function can make long distance trips much easier. You can stop the cruise control by braking at any moment.

 

Breeze II has two built in tail lights which will flash when you are braking.
 

 

By braking on downhill, you can charge your board during the trip.

<p>For the past 7 years i have been following the WHPSC (world human powered speed challenge). I am passionate about creating the most efficient means of transport possible using human power alone. This passion ties in with my love of speed and care for the environment</p>
<p>So far i have done everything on my own. This includes 5 years of research, one prototype bike and hundreds of hours of computer design and aerodynamics analasys. The total cost i have spent on development and research i estimate to be around 15000 AUD. The moulds alone cost 15000 AUD on top of that. I am asking for assistance in helping fund this project. </p>

I dont have any sponsors so by donating you will be helping cover the cost of materials such as carbon fibre cloth, mechanical parts like gears and pedals and eventually the shipping of the bike to america for the race. </p>
<p>This bike race isn't only about speed. Its about developing new technologies to make vehicles and transportation more energy efficient thereby reducing the impact on the environment. Over the past 3 years the record has increased over 7% this is purely due to technologies like 3d printing being implemented into design. These technologies have only become affordable due to demand and increased popularity. Through this project i am trying to spread awareness of renewable energies and sustainability. </p>

<h2>About Cycle Mower X</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552106019/xaorhysrsvfejd5igflz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What you can do more with your e-bike or bicycle?</h3>
<p><strong>Mowing the lawn for your yard or for communities!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong> is the most eco-sustainable ride-on mower in the planet. <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong> is perfect for everyone whether your lawn be large or small or in straight long runs.  </p>
<p>Each year, Americans burn <strong>800 million gallons of gas </strong>cutting their lawns, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>One gas-powered motor releases <strong>88 pounds of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide</strong> and <strong>34 pounds of other pollutants into the air</strong>, the EPA says. Save and conserve with a <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong>. The reel mowers execute the healthiest cut. Their blades cut in a ""scissor"" action which helps the growth of a healthy lawn. <br/>You will benefit from a little exercise for your health too while achieving mowing sustainability without using electricity or gas, which is perfect for rural and urban gardens.  It cuts really cleanly and makes a lovely restful sound instead of a stressful roar like power mowers. <br/>There are no fumes in your face while working, no petrol costs, no noise and no vibrations from an engine when mowing with a <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong>.</p>
<p>It does a MUCH better job than the mowing with a petrol mower.<br/>You save money on fuel and oil while making mowing fun as <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong> will change your gardening experience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552106150/ycjlchiam2rddleu0ugv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The mower is also very light and takes up a small amount of space compared to a petrol mower. The other obvious benefit is that it doesn't use fuel.</p>
<p>A good look for the lawn is achieved after mowing with a <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong>.</p>
<p>It is awesome for the environment too. There are no wires and  no fuel needed to fill up,  so nothing really to go wrong which makes this nice and easy to use.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552106270/aeqy0it1asdo3ewvxrsr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> No petrol, fumes or energy use, just exercise. Easy to clean and maintain.<br/> The children especially love it and play with it without realising that they are cutting the grass!It’s a great way to go green.<br/>Easy to assemble, easy to use. We have a 1.5 acre yard and it's easy to mow with <strong>Cycle Mower X</strong> And it cuts evenly.<br/>While you enjoy the cycling the lawn mowing job is done at the same time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552106365/zloohrgyxgfyxjnlgr66.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>The feedback for reel mowers:</h2>
<p>Great for REGULAR lawn maintenance.</p>
<p>The best bit, no petrol costs and NO fumes in my face while working.</p>
<p>A great device, likely to work well for years.</p>
<p>Great mower for Buffalo, Zoysia, centipede grass, Kentucky bluegrass.</p>
<p>Happy.</p>
<p>People, it is not like a grandpa's old push mower, this works super. Imagine, if everyone start to use push mower. The world will be using less gasoline, more human power, less noise !!!</p>
<p>thinking of getting a reel lawnmower as a petrol also makes me feel ill. hardly surprising as the amount of pollution crud that comes out of a petrol lawn mower and into the lungs is really high for the small amount of petrol used﻿.</p>
<p>It's a great workout that you get used to after a while. I cut the grass mostly for exercise anyway. And I can mow @ 6am if I want to.﻿</p>
<p>Hey, is it much longer to mow your lawn with this than with a gas mower? I consider buying one, but I have a pretty big yard. Takes me about 4 hours to mow it with my standard gas mower. Let's say that 4 hours smelling gas, earing the engine and feeling the vibrations are quite annoying.﻿</p>
<p>In the south a reel mower will make your grass at least 30% greener than a regular mower. My neighbors always ask what fertilizer I use because my grass is better looking and greener than their lawn service. My answer is none, I use a reel mower.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552276244/bvfrfwu5c0umujx8h9sx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is cheaper, quieter, and requires less maintenance. The key is to play with the blade/cutter spacing to get the most effective cut. Personally, I use ~1mm spacing (i.e. still free-rolling) and it seems to work well. Had it for 12 months or so, still no problems.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 minutes to mow the front yard, which is flat. Cutting the grass in the backyard takes about 30 minutes, due to the incline with the house being built on a hill.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552276289/ef2piuzvmgmymrjoglvt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Perfect for the normal family yard. Great fun too!</p>
<p>Economic, light and effective.</p>
<p>The whole family have enjoyed the exercise benefits. </p>
<p>We have found a new way to both get our mountain biking training in and lawn mowed at the same time.</p>
<p>The contraption not only offers a way to exercise, but is also beneficial to the environment.</p>
<p>It's a lot of fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Go On, Your Way</h2>

What you can do more with your e-bike or bicycle?
Mowing the lawn for your yard or for communities!
Yes, Cycle Mower X is the most eco-sustainable ride-on mower in the planet. Cycle Mower X is perfect for everyone whether your lawn be large or small or in straight long runs.  
Each year, Americans burn 800 million gallons of gas cutting their lawns, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
One gas-powered motor releases 88 pounds of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and 34 pounds of other pollutants into the air, the EPA says. Save and conserve with a Cycle Mower X. The reel mowers execute the healthiest cut. Their blades cut in a ""scissor"" action which helps the growth of a healthy lawn. You will benefit from a little exercise for your health too while achieving mowing sustainability without using electricity or gas, which is perfect for rural and urban gardens.  It cuts really cleanly and makes a lovely restful sound instead of a stressful roar like power mowers. There are no fumes in your face while working, no petrol costs, no noise and no vibrations from an engine when mowing with a Cycle Mower X.
It does a MUCH better job than the mowing with a petrol mower.You save money on fuel and oil while making mowing fun as Cycle Mower X will change your gardening experience.

The mower is also very light and takes up a small amount of space compared to a petrol mower. The other obvious benefit is that it doesn't use fuel.
A good look for the lawn is achieved after mowing with a Cycle Mower X.
It is awesome for the environment too. There are no wires and  no fuel needed to fill up,  so nothing really to go wrong which makes this nice and easy to use. 

 No petrol, fumes or energy use, just exercise. Easy to clean and maintain. The children especially love it and play with it without realising that they are cutting the grass!It’s a great way to go green.Easy to assemble, easy to use. We have a 1.5 acre yard and it's easy to mow with Cycle Mower X And it cuts evenly.While you enjoy the cycling the lawn mowing job is done at the same time.

The feedback for reel mowers:
Great for REGULAR lawn maintenance.
The best bit, no petrol costs and NO fumes in my face while working.
A great device, likely to work well for years.
Great mower for Buffalo, Zoysia, centipede grass, Kentucky bluegrass.
Happy.
People, it is not like a grandpa's old push mower, this works super. Imagine, if everyone start to use push mower. The world will be using less gasoline, more human power, less noise !!!
thinking of getting a reel lawnmower as a petrol also makes me feel ill. hardly surprising as the amount of pollution crud that comes out of a petrol lawn mower and into the lungs is really high for the small amount of petrol used﻿.
It's a great workout that you get used to after a while. I cut the grass mostly for exercise anyway. And I can mow @ 6am if I want to.﻿
Hey, is it much longer to mow your lawn with this than with a gas mower? I consider buying one, but I have a pretty big yard. Takes me about 4 hours to mow it with my standard gas mower. Let's say that 4 hours smelling gas, earing the engine and feeling the vibrations are quite annoying.﻿
In the south a reel mower will make your grass at least 30% greener than a regular mower. My neighbors always ask what fertilizer I use because my grass is better looking and greener than their lawn service. My answer is none, I use a reel mower.

This is cheaper, quieter, and requires less maintenance. The key is to play with the blade/cutter spacing to get the most effective cut. Personally, I use ~1mm spacing (i.e. still free-rolling) and it seems to work well. Had it for 12 months or so, still no problems.
It takes about 15 minutes to mow the front yard, which is flat. Cutting the grass in the backyard takes about 30 minutes, due to the incline with the house being built on a hill.

Perfect for the normal family yard. Great fun too!
Economic, light and effective.
The whole family have enjoyed the exercise benefits. 
We have found a new way to both get our mountain biking training in and lawn mowed at the same time.
The contraption not only offers a way to exercise, but is also beneficial to the environment.
It's a lot of fun.

Held on

<br/>
<b>Impact</b><br/>
Foremost,
this sacred act is dedicated to Dionysos with the intent of honoring and pleasing
our beloved god. However, this ritual will also be an opportunity for pagan
community members to come together in joint celebration; some, for the first

<br/>
<span>It is our
hope that the work we do and the energy created will have an impact that will
resonate throughout the polytheist and pagan community--granting blessings,
strengthening bonds and establishing networks. Looking towards the future, the
success of this ritual has the potential to be a strong impetus for creating
future Dionysian gatherings and events.<br/>

The
Bakcheion consists of volunteers with members offering their services for free
and out of their own pockets. As some relief, we're calling for donations to
help cover member travel expenses, accommodation and performance costs;

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It happened so many times in the past. But for me personally, it seems not the case when I've heard about such a tragedy like the Malaysia Flight 370. Furthermore, watching victims relatives grieving with such anger simply because they were unable to burry their love ones in dignity, was chocking and heart broken.                                                            <br/>In such a time of well advanced technology, have we tried enough to address these type of problems the way we should, I've been asking myself. Going back to what happened to flight 370, there are many unanswered questions that need to be addressed, but this time with new ideas.  With over twenty years of experience in the manufacturing industry, I felt the need to tackle this challenge head on. Then all a sudden, a lot of questions started pouring in. </p>
<p>What if, we could come up with a system that would help us pinpoint or get to the trouble site a little faster, instead of searching for weeks, months, or even years?<br/>That could help answering some of the questions we've all tried to ask ourselves after such a tragedy. When did the passengers died, or did all of them died at the same time? For how long they were alive after the crash? Could some lives be saved if help got to them sooner?</p>
<p>Also what if, the Air Traffic Controller did have a better option to re-establish communication with the airplane after it disappeared from the radar?</p>
<p>Again what if, and only if, we could take a snapshot of the inside of the airplane, just to have a clear idea of what was going on prior to the crash. Were passengers and crew members unresponsive? Was there any hypoxia event in the cockpit? Why the pilots did not answer the call? The list can go on and on. That left us with so many questions, but very few answers. </p>
<p>That's the reason we're asking you to join the challenge and make a difference while saving lives all around  the world.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>OFERS is currently patent pending. If we don't reach our goal, our first priority would be to start the patent process in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>It's not so easy to evaluate a program this magnitude. That's why this fundraising is focus primarily on patents and prototype. While the technology that will likely make this project possible may already available, the man power required will be tremendous. We will encourage private high-tech companies and universities to bid on the project while providing their best approach to make this project a reality. Also, not to mention a joint effort of the government agencies all over the world which must play a big role in making this project a reality. This is a world wide campaign for a world wide cause. Once a prototype is available and fully tested, efforts will be made to demonstrate it to the world. One of the best way to do so, if possible, would be to feature OFERS in either a movie or a documentary. Hello Hollywood, you're on notice. We'll see. So as you can see, this fundraising may not be the last, no matter how much money this campaign will raise.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>  Pre-flight safety demonstration like the emergency exits, oxygen mask, life vest and others are not to entertain. They're a reminder that we're about to embark into a serious journey to say the least, whether we want to admit it or not. While this project's main focus is to locate and track a plane in distress, it may also be the tip of the iceberg for future safety and security improvements. OFERS may be designed to even take control of an airplane in some circumstances. Even though the aviation industry is safer than it was many years ago, flying  is still a big concern, with no exception whatsover. OFER tends to bring some hope and confidence to this industry. Surviving a plane crash depends greatly on how fast the rescue team gets to the crash site. OFERS may be there not only to show the way, but also to witness and recite the story later.</p>
<p>This campaign, contrary to many others, is not about pre-selling a product which will likely become obsolete or outdated sooner or later. Rather, it's about impacting the lives of people across the globe for generations to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When this idea was in the making, safety was our main priority. OFERS (super drone) is designed to be silent or unseen while onboard the airplane, with no active Wi-Fi connection whatsoever. However, it only becomes active once the plane is in trouble and the drone is launched either by the pilot or remotely. Also, to increase safety and security, the drone (not the airplane) may be designed to operate under the radar, providing a security clearance from the government is granted. Keep in mind that the drone will likely be controlled, maintained and operated by the government itself or a trusted third-party. Our prediction is that OFERS will likely be known as THE INTERNATIONAL AVIATION EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM. We are confident OFERS will be safe and useful to people around the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't have money to contribute? Do something. Grab your phone or computer and let everyone you know in the world about this project. This project will likely save someone's life one day, and it could be their own. Remember: planes have  crashed and lost before, and it will likely happen again.</p>

<p>I've been working in the communications industry for 25 years and specifically satellite communications. I have always had a keen interest in flight and the science that enables us to fly. At some point I realized that rockets just aren't good enough if ever we really want to conquer space and since then I've been looking and researching to see what other possibilities there could be.</p>
<p>Naturally this involved looking into ""alternative"" science which can be a difficult subject as there are so many claims and stories! Interestingly a very prominent person and his research, although not so well known in ""established"" science,  kept coming to the forefront. He was Nikola Tesla, well known in the ""free-energy"" circles.</p>
<p>Now for the sake of this article I will not go into much detail regarding these discoveries. Suffice to say that he did stumble onto something that would have enabled space flight, which rather than sharing he kept to himself, and when he died, it disappeared.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with my campaign? Well, I believe I have enough information to set up an experiment to test an engine that works on these discoveries by Tesla. This is not based on any of the known patents held by Tesla, and Tesla's work only confirmed the theory I was working on through other research. The basics of this theory involves electro-magnetics (EM). Now before some of you jump up and say that it's impossible, I need to point you to some links wherein research has already been done in this area with some success and to the bewilderment of the scientific community!</p>

<p>Clearly something is happening that modern science apparently cannot explain. This is also the basis of the theory I am currently working on, although different from the ones shown. Funny enough, this theory is not really new. It was just rejected in favor of another!</p>
<p>This campaign to me is only the stepping stone to something much bigger, namely starting a space exploration agency where the average Jane or Joe can play a huge part in making it a success. The Wright Brothers were bicycle manufacturers but that did not stop them from building one of the first successful planes. So what stops us (the average Jane and Joe) from building a spaceship!</p>

<div>As I mentioned above, this campaign ($35 000) is only the<span style=""background-color: initial;""> kick-start for a much bigger goal, namely a space exploration agency by and for the average Jane and Joe. The biggest challenge in this, I believe, will be Stage I: The Engine Platform (EP), as it is yet still unfamiliar territory.</span>
</div>
<div>
<br/>Before I move onto the specifics of the funding, let me just give you a brief outline of the (future) bigger goal and its different stages that would enable us to start our own space agency:</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455624465/f2k1e8qy9bvtwgt4kijj.png"" src="""" style=""width: 722.762px; height: 211px;""/></p>
<br/><br/><p>Depending on the support, we can also run the other stages in parallel with Stage I. This will enable contributors to play a more prominent role by giving ideas and inputs and help out with programming, etc.</p>
<p>Now, back to Stage I where it all starts:<br/><br/>For Stage I I've worked out a budget of $35000 for a 9 month period in which I should be able to verify whether the theory is correct, or not. I already have some equipment and components for the experiment but will need to import additional parts as well. I do not have any expensive measuring equipment but I do not believe it to be necessary for now as the experiment will just be to prove the concept. Test equipment might be necessary at a later stage, but I am confident that I will be able to do without it for now. This will allow me to experiment on a smaller budget (which is important)!  </p>

</div>
<div>Each contributor will receive a thank you note via email, with an attached (printable) certificate of appreciation for his or her contribution to the campaign. Shoulder patches with the campaign logo, as well as caps, will be made available at a discounted price for small-amount (albeit still important!<span style=""background-color: initial;"">) contributors and for bigger-amount contributors as a free gift. However, these options will only be available if the </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">$35000 </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">budget is exceeded by a viable amount, as this is needed for the experiment.<b>  </b>  I would love for every contributor to have a patch that they can proudly wear or display, especially as this could be the start of much greater things - us average citizens having our own space agency! Sounds too big an accomplishment? </span>
</div>
<div>In today's world just about everything has been taken over by big corporations, but the technology they are using came from individuals. Individuals with big dreams like the Wright brothers (who happened to be bicycle makers)! And so there are many more examples of individuals making a huge difference! Rocketry is not the science of the future and we need to change that. I am confident that I have enough information pointing us in a specific direction that, through diligent research, could enable us to reach this dream.<br/><br/>Fancy your name on a plaque on the moon? When the final goal has been reached (sending a probe to the moon and back) we will leave a plaque on the moon with every contributor's name on it. This plaque might end up having quite a long list of names. In order not to clutter the moon with unnecessary debris, the plaque would be made of thin, flexible aluminum or stainless steel, with the names laser cut into the plate and rolled up in a cylinder which will be left on the moon. </div>
<div>So what happens to the funds if this campaign does not reach its first goal?  I would be able to buy much needed components with little money, but <span style=""background-color: initial;"">would battle to find time to physically</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> start and finish the experiment. Half the amount would enable me to buy components and still give me about three months of full-time experimentation, which would be a good start. I did consider doing the campaign via Fixed Funding, but the thought of missing the goal by a few dollars and then losing the opportunity to at least make a start changed my decision. </span>

<div>The space industry is massive and ever growing with not only governments competing against each other, but now private companies as well (SpaceX and Virgin Galactic for example). They are all investing in rocketry to get their equipment up in space, which is expensive and very much limited in its lifting capability.  Your contribution will help me prove that an EMD (Electro-Magnetic Drive) is the way forward! Naturally, if successful, the impact will be massive. We might want to start with cleaning up the space junk floating around earth after sending a probe to the moon and back. The picture below gives an indication of the amount of debris around earth alone:</div>

<p><br/></p> It's clearly a huge problem and one, few companies are willing to invest in. Your contribution could help solve that as well!</div>
<div>Tesla's decision not to share his discovery with the world might seem selfish to some extent but something made him hesitant. As an inventor he depended on private corporations (JP Morgan's Morgan &amp; Company for instance as well as Westinghouse). Unfortunately these corporations had the power to decide the future of his inventions since they were the sole investors. Tesla did not do it for his own personal gain and died a poor man. He was a humanitarian and wanted his inventions to benefit all mankind (and not the few). If crowdfunding had been available in his day, it would have been a very different story!</div>

<div>There is of course a risk that the experiment fails. Unfortunately, success when researching and developing something new, can never be guaranteed. So what makes me so confident you may ask? Well I'll admit that the idea of wasting someone else's money (if the experiment fails) really bothers me! It's the last thing I would like to do! Failure on the other hand does not bother me in the sense that <b>I</b> will have failed, but wasting other people's money, does. </div>
<div>Nobody likes failure but it does serve a purpose. To grow stronger one needs to learn through failure (as well as success). In this world, falling down and getting back up gives you much more experience and strength to tackle the next hurdle even though it might hurt. So why am I willing to risk this at the possible expense of others? My answer to this lies in the information that I've gathered over the years. It's one thing to develop a theory and try to test it just based on your own theory. It's another thing to constantly go over the theory and reassess with new information to check if there is any validity in the theory. This theory is not mine. It's a continuation of various ideas and theories thought out before by others of which Tesla seems to have gotten the closest that we know of. That inspires me to take the leap and hopefully I can inspire you to join me!<br/><br/>Let's look at it in perspective. If 35000 people each contribute $1 we will reach the objective of $35000. So how bad would loosing $1 be? Or even $5 from 7000 people or $10 from 3500 people. Per person that risk becomes very small for the possibility of making a huge difference!

Now, back to Stage I where it all starts:For Stage I I've worked out a budget of $35000 for a 9 month period in which I should be able to verify whether the theory is correct, or not. I already have some equipment and components for the experiment but will need to import additional parts as well. I do not have any expensive measuring equipment but I do not believe it to be necessary for now as the experiment will just be to prove the concept. Test equipment might be necessary at a later stage, but I am confident that I will be able to do without it for now. This will allow me to experiment on a smaller budget (which is important)!  









This comes to a total of $35000.

I will make a detailed expense report available at the end of each month as soon as the money is received from Indiegogo. 


                      Mission patch (pictured above).






Each contributor will receive a thank you note via email, with an attached (printable) certificate of appreciation for his or her contribution to the campaign. Shoulder patches with the campaign logo, as well as caps, will be made available at a discounted price for small-amount (albeit still important!) contributors and for bigger-amount contributors as a free gift. However, these options will only be available if the $35000 budget is exceeded by a viable amount, as this is needed for the experiment.    I would love for every contributor to have a patch that they can proudly wear or display, especially as this could be the start of much greater things - us average citizens having our own space agency! Sounds too big an accomplishment? 

In today's world just about everything has been taken over by big corporations, but the technology they are using came from individuals. Individuals with big dreams like the Wright brothers (who happened to be bicycle makers)! And so there are many more examples of individuals making a huge difference! Rocketry is not the science of the future and we need to change that. I am confident that I have enough information pointing us in a specific direction that, through diligent research, could enable us to reach this dream.Fancy your name on a plaque on the moon? When the final goal has been reached (sending a probe to the moon and back) we will leave a plaque on the moon with every contributor's name on it. This plaque might end up having quite a long list of names. In order not to clutter the moon with unnecessary debris, the plaque would be made of thin, flexible aluminum or stainless steel, with the names laser cut into the plate and rolled up in a cylinder which will be left on the moon. 
So what happens to the funds if this campaign does not reach its first goal?  I would be able to buy much needed components with little money, but would battle to find time to physically start and finish the experiment. Half the amount would enable me to buy components and still give me about three months of full-time experimentation, which would be a good start. I did consider doing the campaign via Fixed Funding, but the thought of missing the goal by a few dollars and then losing the opportunity to at least make a start changed my decision. 














 
The space industry is massive and ever growing with not only governments competing against each other, but now private companies as well (SpaceX and Virgin Galactic for example). They are all investing in rocketry to get their equipment up in space, which is expensive and very much limited in its lifting capability.  Your contribution will help me prove that an EMD (Electro-Magnetic Drive) is the way forward! Naturally, if successful, the impact will be massive. We might want to start with cleaning up the space junk floating around earth after sending a probe to the moon and back. The picture below gives an indication of the amount of debris around earth alone:


 It's clearly a huge problem and one, few companies are willing to invest in. Your contribution could help solve that as well!
Tesla's decision not to share his discovery with the world might seem selfish to some extent but something made him hesitant. As an inventor he depended on private corporations (JP Morgan's Morgan & Company for instance as well as Westinghouse). Unfortunately these corporations had the power to decide the future of his inventions since they were the sole investors. Tesla did not do it for his own personal gain and died a poor man. He was a humanitarian and wanted his inventions to benefit all mankind (and not the few). If crowdfunding had been available in his day, it would have been a very different story!

There is of course a risk that the experiment fails. Unfortunately, success when researching and developing something new, can never be guaranteed. So what makes me so confident you may ask? Well I'll admit that the idea of wasting someone else's money (if the experiment fails) really bothers me! It's the last thing I would like to do! Failure on the other hand does not bother me in the sense that I will have failed, but wasting other people's money, does. 
Nobody likes failure but it does serve a purpose. To grow stronger one needs to learn through failure (as well as success). In this world, falling down and getting back up gives you much more experience and strength to tackle the next hurdle even though it might hurt. So why am I willing to risk this at the possible expense of others? My answer to this lies in the information that I've gathered over the years. It's one thing to develop a theory and try to test it just based on your own theory. It's another thing to constantly go over the theory and reassess with new information to check if there is any validity in the theory. This theory is not mine. It's a continuation of various ideas and theories thought out before by others of which Tesla seems to have gotten the closest that we know of. That inspires me to take the leap and hopefully I can inspire you to join me!Let's look at it in perspective. If 35000 people each contribute $1 we will reach the objective of $35000. So how bad would loosing $1 be? Or even $5 from 7000 people or $10 from 3500 people. Per person that risk becomes very small for the possibility of making a huge difference!








Feel free to share this and join me on Facebook where I'll be able to answer more questions, or send me a message via Indiegogo or follow me on Twitter . Naturally I'm not going to discuss too much regarding the theory! :DBut let's talk about space and the things you would like to see happening when we get this space agency off the ground (pun intended)!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","There
are a lot of factors happen in the world every second,Most of factors happen because of physical exhaustion, play mobile phone or other kinds of distraction.


If there is a warning before it happens?According to our research data representation,if there‘s a warning before it happens 1.5 seconds,people could take actions and avoid accidents.
Why we do it?There is only a small part of the car market have a built-in warning system at present.What about other drivers want a warning system,change a car?
No!We decide to take the challenge to create a warning system can easily
 installed on any vehicle.And now we made it!
Use the camera to get the image in front of the car and analyze the picture through. Once in danger of the model,it gives the driver a warning (sound and vision) .The driver can take action to avoid accidents.What's the most important is that it can be installed in any vehicle easily.
YINCAA Driver Assistant,accurately warning and easily installation.There is no doubt that it will make it easier and safer to drive!

Help us shake up the industry by backing our
product launch through this campaign ！








 

It's way more easier to use than any electronic equipment of vehicle.


Fit for everyone.Fit for every car.



Considering all kinds of road accident, We have
developed Seven warning modes.The 7A Warning.





Forward Collision Warning 
FCW can avoid rear-end accidents
effectively.The system will promptly issue an emergency alert to remind the
driver when almost having collision accident with the forward car at any speed. 



Lane Departure Warning




LDW can reduce the accident effectively due
to lane departure .Detect both sides of the lane, alarm to remind drivers when
vehicle offsets the lane without playing turn signal.



Headway Monitoring /Following Time Warning
HMW can prevent rear-end accidents.Show the following time when behind other
vehicles. When time reduces, remind drivers to slow down to maintain the safe
distance between vehicles.Pedestrian and Bicycle Collision Warning
PCW can avoid collision with pedestrians or
bicycles. Detect pedestrians and bicycles in front, timely alert to remind the
driver when vehicle have collision with pedestrians or bicycles.




Roadside Pedestrian and Bicycle Warning

RPW specially used a city downtown to give way
for pedestrians to avoid accident，Detect the near walking flexible pedestrians to warn the driver to
make way for them.





Speed Limited Indicator
SLI can recognize speed limited sign.Remind drivers to slow down when the speed is higher than the speed limited indicator.

Parking Slide Warning
PSW can prevent collisions traffic due to vehicle sliding or starting.When vehicles in super low-speed situation such as parking or waiting in line, sensitively monitor the distance between the front vehicle.














Driving report & app share
Driving behavior analyze and become report,you can aware of which
action is dangerous from the report. APP provide a more details about the driving
from the device through buletooth .you score your behavior and share it with
other people

This gives the One a bespoke look, with sleek unbroken body contours. Add to this, the premium automotive-grade paint job, and you’ve got an all-round masterpiece with an elite road presence.Powered by Ultra-drive mid-motors from Bafang, and driven by carbon belts from Gates, these bikes are ultra-responsive. They’re also ultra-efficient. The Calamus One gives you upto 50 Miles/80 km of range on a single charge, has a detachable battery and quick-charge capabilities. With an integrated weather-proof computer and navigation touchscreen, the One is the only e-bike to offer integrated support for android apps, rider profiles, and real-time self-diagnosis.To make sure riding on the road is safe for the rider, the bike has inbuilt ultrasonic sensors that gauge traffic from behind and inform the rider if he/she is about to take a turn/change the lane by providing haptic feedback using inbuilt vibration motors in the handlebar. The feedback is intuitive and greatly avoids which could be a fatal crash. The bike is google map-enabled to easily navigate anywhere around the world using a global network card and a GPS chip that comes inbuilt into the bike.The bike also has an ultra-fast biometric scanner for locking, unlocking and rider profile recognition. The scanner is a capacitive fingerprint scanner that is located just below the screen on the handlebar.The GPS and GSM worldwide chip enables worldwide tracking of the bike in case it gets lost or stolen. You can track it very easily using the Find my ride feature on our mobile application. The tracking shows the bike history and informs the user of the location in case a thief is trying to steal the bike.Component theft is a big problem in all cities around the world. We have come up with patent-pending theft-proof fasteners that can only be opened using a special tool that is provided with the bike. These fasteners look very similar to the conventional fasteners but cannot be accessed with conventional tools.You parked your bike in the parking lot and someone is trying to steal or mess with your bike. How do you know? The bike has a built-in anti-theft alarm that works in 2 stages when someone is trying to steal or tamper with the bike. First is a warning provided to the thief in case of an attempt where the owner is also informed through the mobile app, if he/she continues tampering then a loud alarm comes on and another warning is sent to the owner via the app.The bike has a patent-pending smart lock that can be accessed using the mobile app to lock/unlock the bike. The lock is a hidden lock integrated into the frame of the bike which also automatically locks unlock the bike with a simple fingerprint scan or if selected under options you are in the proximity.

<p>When you order on a crowdfunding site, it's a great idea to do some due diligence so you can judge how trustworthy the campaigners are. Here's some background on our company to help you-</p>
<p>You can see from <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flx-electric-bikes-with-attitude"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our original campaign in 2016</a> that we raised $1.7M on Indiegogo (+400K on our site) and got straight to work. As a new company, we encountered many unforeseen challenges that would have stopped many others in their tracks.</p>
<p>We powered through them working 120 hr weeks with no breaks and delivered every single bike ordered. If you want to see how it unfolded you can <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flx-electric-bikes-with-attitude/x/13470983?fbclid=IwAR0Yf4WcvQultuq3odanrLKLkf8fVBA0MxpRAfLM_MfYTu_KyivifGVITuw#/updates/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check the updates section of that campaign</a>.</p>
<p>There are videos of every single step of the manufacturing and delivery of the bikes ordered.</p>
<p>Since then we've run another campaign <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/miles-mini-performance-electric-skateboard/x/13470983"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">for our electric skateboard</a> (delivered every single one), released over a dozen new bike models and shipped thousands more bikes worldwide.</p>
<p>I hope you can recognize that track record and the invaluable experience built up over the years. We are here for the long run and <strong>guarantee the delivery of every bike ordered.</strong></p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>Why is it called the Babymaker?</b></summary> We chose the name because it’s FUN and makes us smile, similar to the experience riding.

 Talk of the TownSee what test riders have to say about The Babymaker:    Frequently Asked QuestionsGeneralIs this a donation or will I get a bike?When you checkout on Indiegogo, you'll see something that reads: ""Your donation is a way to support a project but does not guarantee that you will receive a perk.""
This is just Indiegogo's way of protecting themselves with legal language. They have no control over what type of projects are funded on their platform so they want to cover their butts.
We have a rock-solid track record and we guarantee the shipment of every single bike.

When you order on a crowdfunding site, it's a great idea to do some due diligence so you can judge how trustworthy the campaigners are. Here's some background on our company to help you-
You can see from our original campaign in 2016 that we raised $1.7M on Indiegogo (+400K on our site) and got straight to work. As a new company, we encountered many unforeseen challenges that would have stopped many others in their tracks.
We powered through them working 120 hr weeks with no breaks and delivered every single bike ordered. If you want to see how it unfolded you can check the updates section of that campaign.
There are videos of every single step of the manufacturing and delivery of the bikes ordered.
Since then we've run another campaign for our electric skateboard (delivered every single one), released over a dozen new bike models and shipped thousands more bikes worldwide.
I hope you can recognize that track record and the invaluable experience built up over the years. We are here for the long run and guarantee the delivery of every bike ordered. Why is it called the Babymaker? We chose the name because it’s FUN and makes us smile, similar to the experience riding. Also like the bike it gets quite a bit of attention - which is something we feel electric ridables could use more of! Do you make a step through, off road, fat bike or other model?Yes! You can purchase many other models from us here - note most of these are available for immediate shipping, while supplies last. We also make the best electric skateboards in town, check them out here. Do you have financing?Yes, for those that need it, you can order your Babymaker with financing through our website! Just click this link to learn more and order yours. Will COVID affect production?So far COVID-19 has had 0 effect on production. All of our overseas production facilities are working in full force. We don't foresee any delays due to the corona virus. Why can't I see the battery? We get it, you're used to seeing ebikes with big ugly batteries and wires all over the place. Our engineers spent a tremendous amount of time making the battery disappear completely... But trust us it's there built right into the frame of the bike! Are you hiring? Yes, we have several positions available. Check them out and apply here. Will the production bikes be exactly like the ones pictured? No. They will be even better. We have a few tweaks to make and reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your Babymaker even better. We’ve already made some upgrades based on thousands of miles of real world riding and feedback from test riders around the world. What range can you get?UNLIMITED - with pedaling. It pedals just like a normal bike. With pedal assist, typical riders can expect around 15-50 miles of assisted riding. Range figures are estimates and not a guarantee that you will achieve them. Range varies significantly with terrain, inclines, rider weight, pedal assist level and other factors.
Check out this range report from Eugene's first day out on his Babymaker Beta-
 Are you planning to offer upgrades? Yes, we have some exciting ideas for stretch goals. When the campaign reaches a certain funding amount we’ll unlock these upgrades! Tell your friends so we can release these faster! Which Frame Should I Choose?4’11” - 5’8” Choose the 19” Size 5’9” - 6’7” Choose the 23” Size. Taller riders can check this video from Dave, a 6'6"" rider on the 23"" Tangerine Babymaker - 

  Can It Hold My Weight? We stress test the frames in the lab to 270lbs. That said, Pete and Rob have been known to ride double on one bike, jetting up hills with over 360 lbs combined weight! Can I test one at your office? Yes! Come cruise by the showroom in San Diego. FLX Bike 4170 Morena Blvd. Ste D, San Diego, CA 92117 Is there a warranty? Yes! We use high quality components and are in this for the long run. If you need any support at all you can reach our US Based support team by phone or email. All FLX bikes are protected by a one year warranty. All parts are covered from defect or fault. If anything should fail outside normal wear and tear or rider damage we will send you a replacement component. What if it’s past the warranty or I broke it myself? No stress, we still have your back with excellent support (from real humans in the US) and will help you purchase the correct replacement components to get rolling ASAP. How do I get replacement parts? You’ll be able to purchase replacements on our online store at http://flx.bike. We still stock components for our very first generation of bikes which we launched in 2016. Where can I get my Babymaker serviced? The Babymaker is extremely simple. Aside from the electronics it’s built 100% with standard bike components. Any reputable bike shop will have the tools to service your Babymaker. For any non standard maintenance we will provide video instructions to ensure top quality service. TechnicalCan you ride it in the rain?Yes! The Babymaker performs in even the worst weather. It is rainproof, but we don't recommend going swimming with it.
 What size tires will it fit?In Summary: The production Babymaker has a 700x28C tire. Tires up to 700x32C should be fine. There may be exceptions for taller tire profiles. It may be possible to fit a 35 wide tire but not recommended. 
 How much does it weigh? The Babymaker is one of the lightest electric bikes on the market. In the current configuration It weighs in at just 32lbs. That’s less than just the battery of a typical car! How do you charge the battery and how long does it take? It’s simple, just plug the charger into the charging port located on the head tube. It takes about 2 hours to charge with the 4A fast charger. Can the battery be replaced? While the battery is built into the bike, it can still be removed if ever needed for service. Simply drop the fork, remove the plate on the headtube and pull the battery out to remove. Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world? Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V and uses the same power cable that desktop computers use. Works in every country. Can you charge the bike by pedaling to increase range? No, such a system defies the laws of physics and would decrease the overall range of the bike rather than increase it. Because the efficiency of dynamos and motors is only in the 80-90% range, such a system could only convert ~80% of the energy you put into pedaling into motion. On the other hand, if you simply used this energy to propel the bike, you can put almost 100% of that energy into motion. Put simply, the bike is simpler and will go further without this system. Is there room for a water bottle mount? Yes, there are braze-ons on the seat tube. The touring package comes with a water bottle holder. Are there mounting points for fenders and a rack? Yes, standard mounting points for fenders front and rear along with mounting points for a rack. Will you sell a rear rack?Yes just choose the touring package when you check out to get the included cargo rack.  Can you remove the wheels if you need to put it in a car? You can easily remove the quick release front wheel with no tools in just a few seconds. The rear will take a little longer due to the motor and belt drive. What happens if I get a Puncture? Changing a flat on a Babymaker is exactly the same as on a standard bike. The rear tire can be changed while the motor is still plugged in. How much maintenance does the motor require? The Babymaker motor is maintenance free. Our motor manufacturer has been making these types of motors for years so they’ve been thoroughly tested in the factory, in the field and with 1000’s of other riders. If needed the rear wheel and motor can be easily swapped for a new unit.  LegalWill this comply with the laws in Europe/Australia/Mars? For our friends in Europe and other places, we will be sending the Babymaker with a 250w rated motor and EU compliant speed limit. Motors up to 250w nominal power are legal in most countries. We'll be tuning the 250W version for max performance - you will be hard pressed to notice any difference in performance. The speed limit can be programmed to comply with local laws. What’s the top speed of the Bike? The Babymaker can easily achieve 25mph, for legal reasons, above 25mph the motor cuts out and it’s down to the rider how fast they can pedal. The bikes all have a speedometer in the display so you can see exactly how fast that is. Do I need a special license to operate one? FLX bikes are legal and classified as an electric bike almost everywhere, and as such don't require a special license. Feel free to check the regulations of your local jurisdiction before purchasing. Do I need to wear a helmet? We strongly recommend wearing a good helmet. Accidents happen (ask Rob : D ). If you value what’s inside your head, a helmet can protect it from damage. Not only that, it’s the law in many places. Bottom line: you’re responsible for your own decisions. You may see us riding without helmets from time to time and that’s a value decision we make and own. We trust you’ll make the right decision for you each time you ride. Payments and ShippingHow Much is Shipping?For the US it's $100. If you live outside the US, you can check the most updated shipping rate for your country by beginning the checkout process and inputting your shipping info. There are a handful of special regions (remote islands etc.) with unique handling rates. If that's the case, we may reach out after building your bike to collect any additional fees that apply. Note: There's an additional shipping fee for orders to Hawaii and Alaska. If you order from Hawaii or Alaska, we'll email you with payment instructions when the campaign ends for the additional fee. Can I pick the bike up in San Diego and avoid the shipping charge?Sorry, we expect a very busy shipping season and to speed up all deliveries we will be shipping via UPS, Fedex and other couriers. We cannot accept pickup in San Diego.  When does it ship? We expect to start shipping the first batches of Babymakers in Summer 2020. Shipping is first come first serve, so the sooner you claim yours, the sooner you’ll be riding! Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT? The backer is responsible, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. It is 0% in the US and varies internationally. Is there financing?Yes for Bikes shipped in the UNITED STATES ONLY. You can order your Babymaker with financing through our website! Just click this link to learn more and order yours. What’s the refund policy?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here. We'll put the funds from Indiegogo directly into producing your bike, and delivering each order is important for this project to work.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Key Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>Making HAWKeye from start to finish is not easy. HAWKeye is defining a new approach to the bike experience, incorporating technology like never before. Skillion has its roots in ebike design, engineering, and distribution. The founder has 25 years in technology and engineering experience and the company has built a very experienced team over the last 5 years. Our team thrives in designing, testing, and building advanced technical products. Skilion develops and produces real hardware products for the outdoor environment that are compact, light weight, and appealing while also containing cutting-edge software, connectivity capabilities, and AI.</p>
<p> <br/>Our minimum viable product rocks! What we show in the video still needs to be fully integrated into a complete product. However, we have overcome all the design risks and have a detailed integration plan.</p>
<p>Unexpected challenges may still occur going into production. For example, the fallout from COVID-19 has affected supply chains globally. There are silicon chip shortages in many industries, these that may continue for another year. We are mitigating supply chain risks by second sourcing components where we can. If we cannot, then redesigning in another part that does not have the shortage is part of our plan. This is why we designed HAWKeye from the ground up. </p>
<p>Another key area of improvement and innovation is the integration between the AI software and the hardware. For example, the AI might not be perfect in detecting in every situation. However, similar to how companies like Tesla operate, we will offer powerful, future-proof, hardware from day one. Then, we develop improvements as we collect more data and develop the software overtime.  New features and improvement will be provided with over-the-air updates. </p>
<p>Given our teams ability to innovate quickly, our detailed plans, our experience and hard work, we are confident in meeting the delivery timeline.<br/> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">How was HAWKeye created.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Skillion's history is in technology and bikes and was conceived to support the shift towards sustainability new forms of clean transportation.</p>
<p>The journey began in Sydney, Australia designing, building and distributing ebikes of our own style and brand. We quickly realised their were thousands of bike companies but no one was addressing safety, security issues nor providing the connectivity or riding experience that digital technology can provide.</p>
<p>Our first technology product was an IoT device for a fleet of ebikes offering: GPS tracking, disturbance detection, remote access to the ebike’s motor and siren. We also pioneered something totally new, a means to stop bike theft while it is in progress. That was 2017, below is an image of us at the Brisbane, Australia 4X4 trade show.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Moving the head office to the USA in 2019 was challenging and then issues caused by COVID in 2020 really made life tough. But our small team, based in Bethlehem PA, has grown with the support of the Ben Franklin incubator, collaboration with the Lehigh University and the local community. We developed our mask detection technology to help businesses with the return to 'normal' installed in the Connected Dashboard. </p>
<p>Our breakthrough came when we discovered our secret sauce. The combination of camera technology, AI and a powerful connected computer while leveraging our existing IoT capability meant we had invented something new. Something that would solve the safety &amp; security issues bikers face and improve the user experience all in one light-weight and low-cost package! We developed a working prototype and filed for multiple patents.  </p>
<p>Now  thanks to our new and growing team (below) we are now ready to develop our mission to complete HAWKeye disrupting the industry and bringing  the biking experience into the 21st century. </p>

</div></div>","Inspired in the car industry, with elegant yet dynamic and sportive design lines, the AKTIVO Scoot looks like no other. Finally a powerful scooter to hit the roads in style. Built to perform. 
 Elegance meets performance. The AKTIVO Scoot has the perfect balance between elegance and performance. It is built out of a single-piece magnesium frame, and is propelled by an astonishing empty wheel electric motor. With a 1000W brushless motor, the AKTIVO Scoot is the most powerful scooter in the market.  AKTIVO Scoot’s 1000W hubless electric motor is by far the most powerful motor in an electric scooter of this category to date. This innovative brushless motor uses a set of 60 magnets to deliver an unprecedented torque output and speed control to take you literally anywhere. Besides looking out of this world, the system features position lights, and braking lights together with a high efficiency ceramic brake. 
Forget about pushing your scooter uphill, the AKTIVO Scoot handles 20 degrees slopes like a champ. Our engineers have spent countless hours developing a true vehicle to take you anywhere. From going to work, to getting quick errands done; from catching that gym class on time, to lunch break escapes; AKTIVO Scoot is the perfect personal transporter.  
AKTIVO Scoot’s 13kg and quick folding mechanism create a fully portable last mile vehicle. Easily stored in the trunk of your car or sideways in the subway/train, the AKTIVO Scoot is always ready to help you commute to your next destination. 
 
Check your speed and battery levels while riding. Control your position and front headlight as you cruise at night. Connect to the AKTIVO App to get full access to extended functions such as riding modes, travelling distance, statistics, hardware health, and more. 
  
The AKTIVO App gets you real time insights on your vehicle’s condition, battery charging status, information about your trips, and complete data log. Through the AKTIVO App you can select the riding mode that best suits your need: FUN or ECO. Furthermore, you can update the AKTIVO Scoot latest software, learn how to properly ride your vehicle or check the remaining autonomy while planning your day trips. All of this is possible from the AKTIVO App.   
 While most scooters in the market offer 1A chargers performing a single battery charge in about 5 hours, at AKTIVO we believe recharging as fast as possible is key to completing your daily journey. That's why we offer 2A or 3A chargers with our Scoot packages charging the battery in 3 or 2 hours. WARNING: Using a 3A charger due to its high power, reduces the total amount of recharging cycles. We recommend using the 2A charger on a daily basis, and the 3A charger when you need fast charging occasionally.

   
 
At AKTIVO we develop futuristic electric transporters, that are efficient, look stunning and are a joy to ride.

This provides the option for individualization and keeps maintenance easy.   1. This way we minimize the wear of our unique chain drive, because the motor power acts on the front wheel instead of the chain.2. With the Convercycle Bike, the complete load (payload and driver weight) is centered in between the two wheels. For this setup, the front hub motor is the best option, as you get an all-wheel drive: eMotor on the front wheel, muscle power on the rear wheel.  This also increases safety because the rear wheel will not spin so easily on a wet track.The front hub motor fits our bike perfectly, especially with well-tuned sensors - we tested it!  The chain drive is the heart of our bike. Therefore, we put a lot of effort to ensure that it has a long service life and runs smoothly. The innovative chain drive is separated into three segments. The individual chain segments are connected via ball bearing double sprockets. Separating the chain into three parts allows us not only to increase the tension on the individual chain segments, but also to optimize the chain line considerably, giving us standard chain lengths and a bottom bracket in standard width. Many of you have wondered whether the Convercycle has a locking mechanism. And the answer is: Yes, for both driving modes! The clamp lock can be released easily, by pressing your foot against the integrated pedal. But see for yourself:Another important question was how the rear mudguard will work, since it has to function in both positions of the rear wheel. We designed a rotating mudguard that is easy to operate with one single hand.  Have a cheerful ride!Finally: The Convercycle can be set up vertically to save even more space! It is possible to store it on just one square meter of floor space. Small plastic feet ensure a secure stand and offer protection against damage to the paint finish. The Convercycle Bike “standard” model weighs about 20 kg.The „electric“ model weighs around 26 kg.  As a reference: Regular e-bikes weigh around 20-30 kg, cargo bikes 40-60 kg.  Source: Ritthoff, Michael et al.: Stahl im Vergleich – Verfahren, Ressourceneffizienz, Recycling, Umwelt.

One of our main motivations is sustainability.We want to launch a product that is produced in an environmentally friendly way and lasts a long time!In general, steel is considered a very resource intensive material. In our research, however, we found that this must always be seen in context. And in the context of bicycle frames, steel is far superior to other common materials such as aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced plastic in terms of resource consumption.We love bicycles!There are small bikes and big bikes, new ones and old ones, heavy ones and light ones.All of them are unbeatable for our spontaneous journeys through the city. However, there is a downside when it comes to transportation: cars need a lot of space, they pollute the air and are mostly stuck in traffic jams. Cargo bikes are great, provided you have the parking space they need. What we need in our cities are small bicycles that only turn large when needed!That’s how our idea was born: We simply merged two bikes into one, a city bike and a cargo bike. This way you don’t have to choose. Easy peasy.It wasn’t that easy after all, but a few night shifts later and with the help of our awesome team, the Convercycle Bike came to life:A city bike and a cargo bike in one, which can be converted within 3 seconds. Yes, it works! We want to offer high-quality products that are sustainable in production and use ;-)We are rethinking mobility so that we no longer have to ask ourselves why a single person in a 5-seater SUV drives to work alone every day. Let us change the way we move!    Das Convercycle ist ein einzigartiges Fahrrad, das im Handumdrehen von einem Stadtrad zu einem Lastenrad wird!Es lässt sich in beiden Modi einfach und bequem fahren.    Mit nur einem Handgriff lässt sich das Hinterrad des Convercycle Bikes komplett ohne Werkzeug ausklappen. Dadurch entsteht hinter dem Sattel ein Laderaum für 60 Kilo Gepäck (insgesamt 180 kg für Fahrer und Ladung).So vereint das Convercycle Bike die Vorteile eines kurzen, leichten und wendigen Stadtrades mit den Transportmöglichkeiten eines Lastenrades. Das Convercycle Bike ist ein einzigartiges Transportmittel, das perfekt zum modernen Alltag passt und dem Leben im urbanen Raum eine vollkommen neue Flexibilität bietet.  (Wie kann ich die 19% MwSt. bezahlen? Nach Ihrer Bestellung bei Indiegogo werden wir Sie per E-Mail um die 19% Mehrwertsteuer bitten. Die Indiegogo-Website bietet keine Tools, mit denen wir dieses Thema einfacher verwalten können. Entschuldigung!) Wir bieten zwei verschiedene Antriebsarten des Convercycle Bikes an:Das Standard Convercycle Bike ohne elektrischen Antrieb und das Convercycle E-Bike mit Elektromotor.Beide Modelle sind mit hochwertigen Standardkomponenten ausgestattet. Dies ermöglicht individuelle Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten und eine einfache Wartung.    Wir verwenden einen Frontnabenmotor. Warum? 1. Der Frontnabenmotor fährt sich an unserem Rad am Besten, insbesondere mit der auf unser Fahrrad abgestimmten Sensorik - wir haben es getestet! 2. Wir minimieren den Verschleiß unseres einzigartigen dreiteiligenKettenstrangs, da die Kraft des Elektromotors nicht, wie bei einem Mittelmotor, auf die Kette, sondern auf das Vorderrad einwirkt.3. Beim Convercycle Bike sitzt die Last (Zuladung und Fahrer) mittig zwischen den Rädern. Für diese Lastenverteilung ist der Frontnabenmotor die beste Option, da man so de facto einen Allrad-Antrieb hat: Motorantrieb vorne, Muskelkraft hinten.  So entsteht eine höhere Fahrsicherheit, weil das Hinterrad auf nasser Fahrbahn nicht so leicht durchdrehen kann.  Der Kettenantrieb ist das Herzstück unseres Rades. Dementsprechend haben wir in den letzten Monaten viel Wert darauf gelegt, dass er langlebig und wartungsarm ist . Die Neuerung besteht in der Unterteilung der Kette in drei Segmente. Die einzelnen Kettenstränge wurden durch zwei kugelgelagerte Doppelritzel miteinander verbunden. Somit konnten wir die einzelnen Segmente nicht nur viel besser spannen, sondern auch die Kettenlinie optimieren. Zudem können wir jetzt Standard-Kettenlängen und ein Tretlager in Norm-Breite verwenden. Beide fahrbaren Zustände des Convercycles werden durch einen Verriegelungsmechanismus gesichert.  Die Klemm-Verriegelung lässt sich ohne Schrauben, Hebel oder andere bewegliche Teile lösen. Man drückt einfach mit dem Fuß gegen den integrierten Tritt und entriegelt das Rad. Aber seht am Besten selbst:   Damit ihr während der Fahrt bei schlechtem Wetter gut geschützt seid, darf ein Schutzblech natürlich nicht fehlen. Wir haben ein schwenkbares Schutzblech entworfen, das sich mit nur einer Hand bedienen lässt. Feucht fröhliche Fahrt! Das Convercycle lässt sich hochkant aufstellen. So ist es möglich, es auf einem Quadratmeter Standfläche unterzubringen, beispielsweise in der Garage oder der Wohnung. Kleine Standfüße aus Kunststoff sorgen für einen sicheren Stand und bieten Schutz vor Lackschäden. Das Convercycle Bike wiegt ca. 20 kg in der Standard-Variante. Als E-Bike wiegt es ca. 26 kg.  Zum Vergleich: Normale E-Bikes wiegen in der Regel 20-30 kg. Lastenfahrräder ca. 40-60 kg.    Quelle: Ritthoff, Michael et al.: Stahl im Vergleich – Verfahren, Ressourceneffizienz, Recycling, Umwelt.
