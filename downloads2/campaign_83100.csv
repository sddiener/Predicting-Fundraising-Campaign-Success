One goal is finding and hiring upper-level producers that share the same vision as we do and will work to make our music the best that it can be. Another goal is to organize a solid marketing campaign via social-media and other various sources to generate an interest on a national level.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>I am a singer, conductor and musician living and working in south Devon.  One of my passions is for opera - and for performing opera.  It is a sad state that there is no longer an operatic society in Devon which performs operas (as opposed to musicals or Gilbert and Sullivan).  There are singers in the county who would like to perform operas, and so I have set up Red Earth Opera as a project group to perform at least one opera per year, and possibly more.</p>
<p>We are starting from a base of nothing - no funds, just enthusiasm and determination.  We have two performances booked for March 2015, both of which should generate some income, but I am currently funding everything else from my own (not very deep pocket).  We have singers, we have musicians, and we have an audience as I did a similar venture last year when we performed Purcell's ""Dido and Aeneas"" at the Teignmouth Classical Music Festival.  They invited us back, and we shall be performing a semi-staged version of Mozart's Idomeneo in English with narration instead of recitative, and with an orchestra.</p>
<p>We are also offering places in the orchestra and chorus to talented young musicians from Torbay - these are being supported by a donation from the Torbay Music Hub.</p>
<p>We have a cast, we have some orchestral players, we have the music, and we have had our first rehearsal.  The performances are on Sunday 8th March at the Teignmouth Classical Music Festival, and on Saturday 28th March at Hannah's at Seale Hayne.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need donations of all sizes to pay expenses for soloists travelling to sing from London, Hertfordshire, Wales and Bristol.</p>
<p>We have paid for a translation as there is none published,</p>
<p>We need to pay for our rehearsal venues, and for musicians for the orchestra where we cannot find players willing to give their services.</p>
<p>As conductor and organiser, I am not planning to take a fee unless and until all of the other musicians have received payment or expenses.  If I do take a fee, I shall cap it at £100 (given I have already spent over 100 hours arranging music, promoting and organising rehearsals, marketing etc, this is nothing like a commercial payment).</p>
<p>If you donate £25 or more, then you will be offered a complementary ticket for either performance. Donations of £5 or more will receive a ballpoint pen or pencil with the Red Earth Opera Logo..  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Donations of £50 or more will also receive a white T-shirt with the Red Earth Logo printed on it.  (please indicate size).</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>There is a demand for this - this is our second year.  There is no other such opportunity in Devon.  My aim is to present opera which is different to the large touring companies, or the corporate opera pops, and which is approachable and enjoyable for those who are not already keen on opera.  I also want to give performers opportunities at all levels.  Our major soloists this year are all singers giving their services because they want to learn the roles.  I am certain some of them will go on to great things.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>These performances will happen - this year.  At the moment, I am underwriting, and very possibly subsidising this because I am passionate about it.  I make my money from music, but this project is never going to make me any money.  I would like to be able to set up a company so that we can continue with this, and to grow it into the future.</p>

<h2><b><b>WHO AM I?</b></b></h2>
Hi, I'm Amaka. Singer. Songwriter. Dreamer.<br/><p>
Born and raised in Germany, I have moved around a bit and the experiences I made flow
into my music. My songs celebrate the light that gets us through dark times. <br/>
It is music for the soul with percussive elements and influences like Blues and Reggae.<br/>
<br/>
I left the certainty of work in London's media industry to return to 
Germany
and focus on music. It wasn't easy but I managed. With my band I've 
performed throughout Europe, and I have also had the pleasure of singing
 alongside renowned blues and jazz musicians, like Marla Glen and 
Hans-Günther Adam. 
</p>
<p>""When will you release an album?"" is  a question I get asked a lot by friends,
family and fans. It has been a long time coming, but I am finally ready!! I've spent the last two
years writing songs and am surrounded by an amazing team of musicians and
production people. We are all set to record and release my debut EP  and I have been saving toward it - <i>but </i>I need <b>your

<div>I have spent my entire life absorbing the musical traditions around me. From riding in the car and listening to Mexican norteño music with my father, to my first high school jazz band, the experiences that I have cherished most in my life have been pushing me towards this moment: when, after four years of a rigorous higher musical education from Bard College, I finally feel ready to take everything musical I've ever loved and make my own statement.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><i>That's right everyone, it's my first EP!</i></b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And for such an occasion, I want to pull out all the stops, to provide you all with the best possible musical product I can conjure. In preparing the material, I have written pieces that require a veritable HAZMAT team of (17!) musicians, or to give you a better idea, about half a big band. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And what exactly will we be bringing you? Very good question. As intimated previously, I've spent years digging through a whole catalogue of different musical styles, each of which have assumed a coveted place in the musical landscape. </div>

</div></div>","Friends (both old and new),

I have spent my entire life absorbing the musical traditions around me. From riding in the car and listening to Mexican norteño music with my father, to my first high school jazz band, the experiences that I have cherished most in my life have been pushing me towards this moment: when, after four years of a rigorous higher musical education from Bard College, I finally feel ready to take everything musical I've ever loved and make my own statement.

That's right everyone, it's my first EP!

And for such an occasion, I want to pull out all the stops, to provide you all with the best possible musical product I can conjure. In preparing the material, I have written pieces that require a veritable HAZMAT team of (17!) musicians, or to give you a better idea, about half a big band. 

And what exactly will we be bringing you? Very good question. As intimated previously, I've spent years digging through a whole catalogue of different musical styles, each of which have assumed a coveted place in the musical landscape. 

Everything from jazz:


        A little ballet jazz tune I wrote and arranged called ""Dance for Patricia.""
 
To classical:

A short clip of the second movement from Beethoven's ""Pathetique.""

To Harlem stride piano:

It took some time to figure that one out.
Now, after having done all of that, the only logical step is to put them all together and create something completely new! That's right; by taking apart these styles and putting them back together again, we (all 17 of us) want to create a new kind of sound. 
Not only that, but we want to do it live. No auto-tune, no overdubbing, no nets to catch us; nothing but all of us in the studio together with our instruments to pave the way. 
Now, as you can imagine, not many engineers, much less studios, would be inclined to take on such a project. But thankfully, we found this guy:

Meet Paul Antonell, Master of the Soundboard, the EP project's Musical Godfather, and the owner/proprieter of The Clubhouse, one of the most illustrious American recording studios, situated in Rhinebeck, NY (coincidentally, a stone's throw from Bard College), and one of the only places big enough to hold us.
When I met with him, not only did he not cringe; his eyes lit up. Soon, we were pacing through the whole studio trying to figure out where to place everyone, documented by my handy-dandy iPhone:
When you meet someone who's that gung-ho for your project, you'd be a fool to say no! 
Which, finally, brings us to our musicians. I know for my first journey into recorded music that I would want to take with me as many of my passionate and gifted musical comrades from the Bard years, many of whom have projects of their own. They are:


Ryan MacLean (of Meadowhawks) – Drums, Percussion
Angela Skarpelis – Percussion
Alex ""Freedom"" Friedman – Percussion
Joe Tisdall – Guitars
Jory Dawidowicz – Bass
Rachel Ana Dobken – Guest Vocals
Ariana Stultz – Backup Vocals
Nelle June Anderson – Backup Vocals
Brianna Reed – Backup Vocals
Spencer Beatbox – Beatbox
Scott Moore – Violin
Trygve Butler – Trumpet
Szabolc Koczur – Trumpet
Cameron West – French Horn
Janos Sutyak – Trombone
Nick Reilingh – Trombone
Derek Fenstermacher (of The New Jersey Symphony!)– Tuba
In addition to all of these fine noisemakers, we'll also be bravely stepping into the studio with a film crew to document the EP's creation, lead by the inimitable Yuxin Huang!
Words cannot describe how excited we all are about this project; so much so that we've already started rehearsing!

Slowly, but surely, we're making our way through the material to get us tight and ready for our recording session on Monday, April 6th through Wednesday, April 8th. 
But we still need your help to get there!   Where You Come In!

<p>I have been a long time peace activist and
worked with disadvantaged and vulnerable people of all stripes my
entire life.  This I combined with artistic pursuits to give
me a certain balance. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>20 years ago I worked as a 'Passive Recreational Tutor' at
 a Juvenile Justice Centre, teaching pottery.  This is where I first 
witnessed Music therapy,  I often sat all night watching over an open 
dorm, where a young man wore headphones to bed to help calm him as he 
fell asleep to music.</p>
<p>In April, 2014, I was part of a Peace Pilgrimage to Syria to deliver 2 
tonnes of Medical Aid to the people suffering in this strife torn 
country.  During this visit I again witnessed the power of music when 
visiting internal refugee camps in Syria.  I had encouraged my son to take 
his guitar and play.  The music crossed all age boundaries, old women 
danced, children joined in and laughter and clapping rang out with the 
music.  Raising the funds to deliver instruments to Afghanistan is my 
latest endeavour, this money will also go towards music teachers.   I 
will be travelling to Afghanistan in May to this end.  All my travel 
costs will be paid for by me and will not come out of the instrument 
fund.  All funds will go toward instruments, tutors and school 
infrastructure needed. <br/></p>

<h2>The Project:</h2>To record an innovative, new composition, <i><b>Stars &amp; Distances</b></i> by Fredrick Kaufman, which will serve as a special soundtrack for Miami’s new Frost Planetarium at the Patricia and Phillip
Frost Museum of Science in downtown Miami's Museum Park.<br/><br/>
<h2>Our Story:</h2>
<h2></h2> In the summer of 2014, FGO’s General Director &amp; CEO, Susan T. Danis was approached by conductor Andrew Bisantz with a project proposal: to record composer Fredrick Kaufman's innovative composition <i><b>Stars &amp; Distances </b></i>so it could become a special soundtrack to the new Frost Planetarium.<br/><br/>With assistance from Bisantz, composer Fredrick Kaufman, and Frost Science, FGO was able to pull together an enthusiastic team to get this project off the ground. By early fall of 2014, singers had been arranged, a recording company was scheduled to fly down, and donations to fund the project were lining up.<br/><br/>
<h2>Why We Need YOU!<br/>
</h2>

<a name=""about"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h1>About Stars
&amp; Distances: </h1>
</b><p><br/>Stars and Distances is an 18’ work for a 16-voice vocal chamber ensemble. The piece, first conceptualized in 1976, was completed in 1982 and premiered to “great success” in 1986 by the Pacific Lutheran University Chorus. The piece has since been revised in anticipation for this project. <br/>
</p><p>Kaufman on <i><b>Stars and Distances</b>:</i></p><div>
<span>
<blockquote>
<i><b>Stars &amp; Distances</b></i> came to me as I lay on my back one night in Hyde Park, London, staring up at the Cosmos trying to imagine what overwhelming assemblage of specs would sound like if they indeed had a sound. The next day I came back with a telescope and charts I had borrowed from the University of London Astronomy Department.<br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>… I decided to try to identify 15
of the brightest stars in the sky that night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As I researched those stars I
discovered that each one of them had an individual fascinating characteristic …
All of them are considerably larger than our sun and many, much more powerful. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I then set out to work writing the composition.</blockquote>
<p>As Kaufman explains, those 15 stars served as the catalyst
for his composition. The piece is divided into 15 parts, each marked by the “individual
fascinating” characteristics of the stars which inspired him. Such
characteristics include sound quality, volume, complexity, and energy delivered
by the 16-voice ensemble. </p>
<p>Throughout the composition we hear essences of undulating scientific and poetry readings by actors John Fleming and Karen Fuller drawn from the brilliant writings of renowned scientists and poets, all related to the subject,<i> Stars and Distances. </i></p></span>

<h3>The Frost Planetarium</h3> <br/>

Thanks to an additional $10 million gift from Patricia and Phillip Frost, visitors at Frost Science will be able to explore the universe, from the depths of space to the building blocks of the cosmos, at the state-of-the-art, 250-seat Frost Planetarium.<br/><br/>
 
Longtime supporters of South Florida’s arts and culture, the Frosts had previously made a $35 million donation to name the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science. Now, they are helping to complete one of the world's most advanced planetariums. The Frost Planetarium will feature a high-resolution, 16-million-color, 8K projection system, surround sound and software that will support the latest immersive experiences and allow images and data from NASA (space), NOAA (weather), and the U.S. Geological Survey (land) to be projected on the dome.<br/><br/>
 
With Frost Planetarium's raked stadium-style seating and a seamless screen tilted at 23.5 degrees to match the tilt of the Earth’s axis in space, visitors will be able to look forward, rather than up, for a comfortable and immersive viewing experience. Visitors will be able to travel to distant galaxies, tour our planet from space, dive deep into the Gulf Stream, explore the inside of the human brain or discover the new world of nanotechnology. <br/><br/>
 
Live broadcasts from scientists in the field, spectacular laser light shows and visuals transmitted by space probes or orbiting satellites are among the Frost Planetarium's unique experiences for visitors. In addition, the Frost Planetarium will serve as a uniquely appealing function space for events such as conferences, presentations and award ceremonies.<br/><br/>
 
Immersive environments are on the rise, and it is the Frost Planetarium’s purpose to open the doors of its dome to scientists, educators, and students to help them develop their own content, while contributing to their careers, and the furthering of the medium. <br/><br/>
 
In keeping with the Frost Science commitment to become a world-renowned facility with school programs, live presentations, pre-rendered shows, public lectures, and performances, Frost Science staff, including Brooks Weisplat, VP of Technology, Dr. Jorge Perez-Gallego, Exhibition Developer, and Mark Bennett, Planetarium &amp; Visitor Services Manager, recently attended the Immersive Media Entertainment, Research, Science &amp; Arts 2015 International Summit in Denver, CO.<br/><br/>
 
""Research shows that planetariums may be one of the best environments to be effectively introduced to astronomy, and the mysteries of the cosmos. But it does not stop there, as the Frost Planetarium will also take you on memorable journeys to the depths of the ocean and the wonders of the brain. The Frost Planetarium will be an unforgettable immersive experience set to strengthen the understanding of the world around us and inspire the next generation of scientists.""
Dr. Jorge Perez-Gallego, Astronomer and Exhibition Developer at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science<br/><br/>
<h3>Completing the Frost Planetarium Dome </h3><br/>
 
With its high profile, easily visible location, the Frost Planetarium dome will be a distinctive highlight at Frost Science. This spring, the museum celebrated the completion of the enclosure for its digital dome, a major construction milestone.<br/><br/>  
 
Completion of the dome was a carefully orchestrated project that took almost three weeks to complete under the direction of Skanska USA and Hill International. The operation began with erecting a massive, 50-foot tall center shoring tower and setting a precast dome cap. Then, construction crews installed the 54 concrete panels that make up the self-supporting planetarium dome. The panels were installed opposite one another in a counter-clockwise rotation to avoid lateral load on the dome capstone – the top center portion, 30 feet in diameter, which anchors all of the panels.<br/><br/>
 
Each concrete panel measures approximately 48 feet from base to top, is roughly 9 feet wide at the base and tapers to approximately 3 feet at the top, where the panels meet the capstone. The total weight of all pieces of the dome exceeds 1.6 million pounds.<br/><a href=""#top"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_self"">Top of Page</a><br/>

The Project:To record an innovative, new composition, Stars & Distances by Fredrick Kaufman, which will serve as a special soundtrack for Miami’s new Frost Planetarium at the Patricia and Phillip
Frost Museum of Science in downtown Miami's Museum Park.
Our Story:
 In the summer of 2014, FGO’s General Director & CEO, Susan T. Danis was approached by conductor Andrew Bisantz with a project proposal: to record composer Fredrick Kaufman's innovative composition Stars & Distances so it could become a special soundtrack to the new Frost Planetarium.With assistance from Bisantz, composer Fredrick Kaufman, and Frost Science, FGO was able to pull together an enthusiastic team to get this project off the ground. By early fall of 2014, singers had been arranged, a recording company was scheduled to fly down, and donations to fund the project were lining up.
Why We Need YOU!

Just as the recording process began, these anticipated donations did not come through. Although FGO was able to put up enough money to fund the initial recording fees, the project has since been put on
hold.
We need you to help fund this special soundtrack to Miami’s new Frost Planetarium at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science.


Budget Breakdown



About Stars
& Distances: 
Stars and Distances is an 18’ work for a 16-voice vocal chamber ensemble. The piece, first conceptualized in 1976, was completed in 1982 and premiered to “great success” in 1986 by the Pacific Lutheran University Chorus. The piece has since been revised in anticipation for this project. 
Kaufman on Stars and Distances:


Stars & Distances came to me as I lay on my back one night in Hyde Park, London, staring up at the Cosmos trying to imagine what overwhelming assemblage of specs would sound like if they indeed had a sound. The next day I came back with a telescope and charts I had borrowed from the University of London Astronomy Department.

… I decided to try to identify 15
of the brightest stars in the sky that night.
As I researched those stars I
discovered that each one of them had an individual fascinating characteristic …
All of them are considerably larger than our sun and many, much more powerful. 
I then set out to work writing the composition.
As Kaufman explains, those 15 stars served as the catalyst
for his composition. The piece is divided into 15 parts, each marked by the “individual
fascinating” characteristics of the stars which inspired him. Such
characteristics include sound quality, volume, complexity, and energy delivered
by the 16-voice ensemble. 
Throughout the composition we hear essences of undulating scientific and poetry readings by actors John Fleming and Karen Fuller drawn from the brilliant writings of renowned scientists and poets, all related to the subject, Stars and Distances.

The Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science aims to make a difference in people’s lives by inspiring them to appreciate the impact that science and technology can have on every facet of our world. In 2016, Frost Science will continue to inspire visitors in a new state-of-the-art facility designed by Grimshaw Architects currently under construction at Museum Park, in the heart of downtown Miami. The museum will be structured around a lushly landscaped indoor and outdoor Living Core Aquarium of terrestrial and aquatic environments, featuring a Gulf Stream tank experience totaling over 500,000 gallons of salt water. The facility will also feature the state-of-the-art full dome Frost Planetarium, the Knight Learning Center, Innovation Center and Cafe, and an Exploration Center featuring permanent interactive exhibits: Feathers to the Stars and The River of Grass. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution and a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers. The Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science is funded with the support of Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor and Board of County Commissioners. Learn more at www.frostscience.org.
The Frost Planetarium 

Thanks to an additional $10 million gift from Patricia and Phillip Frost, visitors at Frost Science will be able to explore the universe, from the depths of space to the building blocks of the cosmos, at the state-of-the-art, 250-seat Frost Planetarium.
 
Longtime supporters of South Florida’s arts and culture, the Frosts had previously made a $35 million donation to name the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science. Now, they are helping to complete one of the world's most advanced planetariums. The Frost Planetarium will feature a high-resolution, 16-million-color, 8K projection system, surround sound and software that will support the latest immersive experiences and allow images and data from NASA (space), NOAA (weather), and the U.S. Geological Survey (land) to be projected on the dome.
 
With Frost Planetarium's raked stadium-style seating and a seamless screen tilted at 23.5 degrees to match the tilt of the Earth’s axis in space, visitors will be able to look forward, rather than up, for a comfortable and immersive viewing experience. Visitors will be able to travel to distant galaxies, tour our planet from space, dive deep into the Gulf Stream, explore the inside of the human brain or discover the new world of nanotechnology. 
 
Live broadcasts from scientists in the field, spectacular laser light shows and visuals transmitted by space probes or orbiting satellites are among the Frost Planetarium's unique experiences for visitors. In addition, the Frost Planetarium will serve as a uniquely appealing function space for events such as conferences, presentations and award ceremonies.
 
Immersive environments are on the rise, and it is the Frost Planetarium’s purpose to open the doors of its dome to scientists, educators, and students to help them develop their own content, while contributing to their careers, and the furthering of the medium. 
 
In keeping with the Frost Science commitment to become a world-renowned facility with school programs, live presentations, pre-rendered shows, public lectures, and performances, Frost Science staff, including Brooks Weisplat, VP of Technology, Dr. Jorge Perez-Gallego, Exhibition Developer, and Mark Bennett, Planetarium & Visitor Services Manager, recently attended the Immersive Media Entertainment, Research, Science & Arts 2015 International Summit in Denver, CO.
 
""Research shows that planetariums may be one of the best environments to be effectively introduced to astronomy, and the mysteries of the cosmos. But it does not stop there, as the Frost Planetarium will also take you on memorable journeys to the depths of the ocean and the wonders of the brain. The Frost Planetarium will be an unforgettable immersive experience set to strengthen the understanding of the world around us and inspire the next generation of scientists.""
Dr. Jorge Perez-Gallego, Astronomer and Exhibition Developer at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science
Completing the Frost Planetarium Dome 
 
With its high profile, easily visible location, the Frost Planetarium dome will be a distinctive highlight at Frost Science. This spring, the museum celebrated the completion of the enclosure for its digital dome, a major construction milestone.  
 
Completion of the dome was a carefully orchestrated project that took almost three weeks to complete under the direction of Skanska USA and Hill International. The operation began with erecting a massive, 50-foot tall center shoring tower and setting a precast dome cap. Then, construction crews installed the 54 concrete panels that make up the self-supporting planetarium dome. The panels were installed opposite one another in a counter-clockwise rotation to avoid lateral load on the dome capstone – the top center portion, 30 feet in diameter, which anchors all of the panels.
 
Each concrete panel measures approximately 48 feet from base to top, is roughly 9 feet wide at the base and tapers to approximately 3 feet at the top, where the panels meet the capstone. The total weight of all pieces of the dome exceeds 1.6 million pounds.Top of Page

Todos estos relacionados con el tema de Estrellas y Distancias (""Stars and Distances"").

In way of introduction my name is Paddy Ryan, I am 26 years old and have performed as a musician for 16 years.  The music industry is already very full to bursting point with bands all competing for the same space. </p>
<p>I was recently asked to write a song in memory of Chaplin Mychal Judge for members from the Fire department of New York. I did this, which was greatly received. Musicians have also asked to record my songs, but they are certain to not perform them how I have intended.</p>
<p>Currently I have an album worth of songs I have been asked to record. I have been invited to travel to Los Angeles to a major studio, which would guarantee the quality that is needed. It would also be much easier to contact the correct people for help with promotion and production, with the studio behind the project.</p>
<p>It has taken 16 years and every cent and penny I have earned to get this opportunity to have my work recorded correctly. To have these songs recorded with experts in the industry will assure the subject matter will receive the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Some of the songs are serious and others are feel good songs, I would love you to hear them but I can't achieve this on my own.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this project to be as successful, it will require £2000 ($3050). This will be broken down as follows;<br/>£630 - Trans-Atlantic flights<br/>£150- Hotel for duration of recording<br/>£1220 - Recording time, mastering, production costs.</p>
<p>By contributing to the project you will be rewarded with special gifts based on the amount you can afford to pledge, ranging from signed albums, merchandise, personal song recordings up to personal concerts. </p>
<p>If the album does not reach the goal of £2000 in its entirety, the project will continue but the studio time period would be greatly reduced at a cost to quality and quantity.</p>
<p>If we raise more than the goal, the extra funds will be spent on promotion and reaching more people with the messages and stories in the music.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Once the album is complete it will be promoted on radio and to the everyone who has a copy. The songs are very meaningful and poignant, especially to the Fire Fighter community and those who risk their lives for others. </p>
<p>This is a debut solo album but having performed on other artists work, it is already expected to be a firm favourite, taking in many styles from rock, country, celtic rock, folk and power ballads. A true melting pot of styles from around the world.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have scheduled 5 full days in the studio, which does not seem a lot of time to get what in essence takes 5 hours per song to record alone. However the songs have been fully written, rehearsed  and ready to be recorded. The production team also includes rockstars from different genres along with top Hollywood producers, with many decades of experience recording top artists in LA.   </p>
<p>The only other issue that is possible is a adverse weather could delay flights and therefore start time. If this unlikely event should happen, the time lost will be recovered by working through every second we have available at my expense. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>This project does need as much money as possible to achieve the best results. We have tried to include an option for everyone to play their part, however I also understand that not everyone can contribute money. </p>
<p>The album requires people to know it exists which means radio play, social media, word of mouth etc. If you can not contribute please share this with your friends and family. If everyone could contribute that would be amazing and give our subject matters the attention they deserve, but we still need your help to let people know it exists.  </p>
<p>Please join us on this project, your contribution is vital to the success which will feel amazing knowing that we have achieved it together.</p>

We can make this happen. A photo below shows me in 1988 at the University of Nevada Las Vegas where I attended many classes in music theory, composition and classical guitar. A few of the compositions I have planned to be on this project were being rehearsed and fine-tuned during this time period around 1988. I was just 25! Through the years I have been very careful and meticulous to save and protect the original recordings I did, I had hoped some future day an album or more of my classical guitar performances would be presentable to the public in a  very professional manner. 
My Videos below, and in the gallery are recent recordings done in 2015.  All these recordings need the additional ""mastering touch"" of a sound engineer and the professional packaging of Disc Makers.
Visit the gallery  and see my other music videos here on Indie Gogo. I have five compositions by various composers here on the campaign page for you to sample, On You Tube I have about 200  videos, with over a million views, and about 3,000 subscribers. Visit my website (see link on campaign page) to discover more about me. I thank all my early and new listeners, and supporters of my music. You have no idea what you mean to me! I also thank all the fellow musicians and friends. A special thank you to Muriel Anderson for having me perform with her now a couple times. Thanks to all who have purchased my Guitar Journey book on CD and ""How to Fingerpick Guitar Like the Best"" on Amazon. Thank you so very much!Musically Yours,Ray Tutaj Jr.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div>Hi! I'm Ari Shagal, composer and bandleader of the Summarily Dismissed, a NYC soul/jazz group with a humorous twist. Last year, we played a great show at the Harrisburg Midtown Arts Center, and we've been invited back this year. It's a fantastic venue, and a great opportunity for us to establish ourselves as regional artists and use the momentum for more gigs around the northeast. But traveling always comes at a cost, and this is no exception. So, I thought it would be a good idea to get some help from you, the fans, and offer you some unique perks in exchange, from a shoutout in the liner notes of our next album to a private house concert where you live!</div>

<p>Recently, our inimitable singer Matt Lomeo moved to Memphis, a nerve center of the blues. Even as he pursues solo performances in that genre, though, he is not gone from our ranks (what can I say, his voice is THAT good!) So, the cost of us traveling to Harrisburg this year is steeper than it was last year, simply because getting him up from Memphis, in addition to the rest of us heading over from NYC, adds a sizable amount to the total. We're trying to fulfill a goal of $2500, as that will cover the cost of travel expenses, lodging, and musician compensation.  In return, because we know that not everyone is in a position to fork over significant amounts, we're offering an eclectic range of perks, at an equally eclectic range of prices. For as little as $5, you can get your name listed in the ""Special Thanks"" section of our next album. We also have several perks available for under $100 each, including t-shirts, homemade cookies, a Q&amp;A session with the band via Skype, and even the chance to pick a cover song for us to add to our repertoire. For $100, you get a music lesson with a conservatory-trained composer and music theoretician (that being yours truly), either in-person (for those in the NYC area) or via Skype. For $150, you can choose THREE cover songs for our lineup. Further up the giving ladder, you have the opportunity to book us for a house concert-- no one will ABANDON your living room if you've got A BAND IN your living room!</p>

<p>I believe her loving support also led me to always strive to do more. Since 2008 I have worked on projects with Disney, Nickelodeon, TLC and have directed and edited many commercials, music videos and short films...including co-producing a documentary film, called ""Within Reach"" about a bicycle journey across the US visiting 100 sustainable communities.

<p>Since then I have been dedicated to producing media that inspires people to find their own path towards a sustainable future and a life filled with the gifts of nature. During the Blue Ocean Film Festival last year I had the opportunity of showing my latest documentary ""One Simple Question"" and talking with conservationists from around the world. I remember one ocean scientist saying ""if he can get people to look under the water, he can get them to care about ocean conservation."" At this same festival I attended a sneak peak of a new secret Google project called Google Cardboard, where I got to see first hand the power of virtual reality. I knew then, if we could get people to look around at the beauty of the national parks we could get them to care.</p>

</div></div>","“What would our lives be like if our days and nights were as immersed in nature as they are in technology?” 
― Richard Louv, The Nature Principle: Human Restoration and the End of Nature-Deficit Disorder

We're pretty sure you've heard of or visited a National Park...or maybe you've seen a really cool documentary about them on Netflix. Did you know that America was the first country in the world to create one? The foundation of Yellowstone in 1872 set the stage for what would become our National Park System with a mission to protect unique ecosystems so that all people from all over the world --not just the privileged few-- could experience our natural heritage for generations to come.These protected lands are places where we can experience the world the way our ancestors experienced it. When we need a break from the buzz of city life nothing can lift our spirits the way the sounds of nature can.  Nature's story can be heard in the babbling rivers, creeks and streams that move across the land, the rushing of waterfalls, the howls, hoots and chirps of the dwellers of the forest. And when night comes we can see the sky exploding with the light of stars and galaxies millions of light years away. When we're in the forest we can hear a story that is as old as the stars themselves. Not only are these lands a treasure and learning resource for humans, they're also important for biodiversity by helping preserve habitats for countless plants and wildlife and protecting endangered species. In 2016 the National Park Service will turn 100 years old and WildEyes wants to celebrate by joining them in their mission to inspire a whole new generation of park lovers.Starting this Fall, we will embark on an exciting journey to capture all 59 of our National Parks in a way you've never seen them before; from the Everglades in swampy southern Florida to one of our harshest desert environments, Death Valley, in eastern California.What's really exciting about this project is that we'll be filming these wild spaces with a specially designed camera that films in 360°. This innovative technology creates an immersive experience when combined with a smartphone and a virtual reality headset like Google cardboard. When viewed in this way, the video responds to the viewer's movements. If you look to the right, the video will move to the right and vice versa, creating a unique, engaging interaction between viewer and each national park.
“An environment-based education movement--at all levels of education--will help students realize that school isn't supposed to be a polite form of incarceration, but a portal to the wider world.” ― Richard Louv, Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit DisorderWe will develop lesson plans for young people that will accompany these interactive videos. We are excited to offer an important and memorable 'virtual field trip' - an opportunity to interact with and be inspired by our country's beautiful natural spaces and the biodiversity we can find there.We'll be traveling in our mobile production-studio, a converted 1985 Thomas bus, to relieve the high cost of lodging, create a mobile working environment and because living/working in a bus sounds pretty cool to us! But before we can do that we have to build beds that turn into desks, customizable storage areas in every corner, and a kitchen to keep the cost of human-fuel (food) down.Of course, in order to get where we want to go we need fuel (bus food). Lot's of it! We'll also need to pay for our parking spots in the National Parks and all of the permits required to film there. Now the technology: filming 360° requires a fancy set up that uses multiple cameras to capture video in 6 different directions. These videos are then filtered, color-corrected and finally stitched together using information from each shot to sync them with mathematic precision and an artistic touch. We also need sound equipment to capture nature's sounds in high-quality and 360° ...that way it makes you feel like you're really there!We'll be using Unofficial Cardboard as our viewer of choice, and as our viewers in classrooms and events.

The initial pr<strike>o</strike>duction<strike> o</strike>f my very first debut s<strike>o</strike>l<strike>o</strike> EP is finished and I am just a few sh<strike>o</strike>rt steps away fr<strike>o</strike>m completing this dream of mine. April 4th 2015, I wrapped up production on my Debut Self Titled EP ""Conversations"" with Mike Marsh of The Avett Brothers at Paper Mill Studio in Nashville TN. This was all thanks to you guys, Thank You So Much!!! However in order to finish this EP I am calling on you guys once again. You see, I have raised all but $2500.00 of my goal and that is all that stands in the way of making this dream a reality. The EP has a stellar cast of Musicians featuring Mike Marsh (The Avett Brothers) on drums, Paul Defiglia (The Avett Brothers) on stand up bass, Critter Fuqua (Old Crow Medicine Show) on banjo and accordion as well as some up and coming Nashville session musicians Kyle Cox, Rachel Smith and Avery Bright. I will be offering similar perks for those of you who wanted to contribute but were unable last time as well as a couple of new ideas.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Needs &amp; Wants...</h3> <p>So like I said I need to raise $2500.00, I am nervous doing another campaign so soon, but confident in the support the songs and project have been receiving, especially having only played a hand full of shows. The funds will be spent as follows.</p>
<p>Mixing- $500.00</p>
<p>Mastering- $500.00</p>
<p>Pressing (getting the material on cd, and the artwork pressed to have physical copies to give to you and sell to others)- $1500.00</p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime, or should I say a make or break opportunity for me to live a dream, for helping me get there I will make sure you are rewarded by receiving perks that will only be available through this campaign.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, although I am confident in you guys!!! The funds will all still go toward the final processes in completing the EP.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Thumprints</h3> <p>Like I said this is a dream and that's why I cannot and will not give up.

</div></div>","The story goes something like this... Hey Friends! The initial production of my very first debut solo EP is finished and I am just a few short steps away from completing this dream of mine. April 4th 2015, I wrapped up production on my Debut Self Titled EP ""Conversations"" with Mike Marsh of The Avett Brothers at Paper Mill Studio in Nashville TN. This was all thanks to you guys, Thank You So Much!!! However in order to finish this EP I am calling on you guys once again. You see, I have raised all but $2500.00 of my goal and that is all that stands in the way of making this dream a reality. The EP has a stellar cast of Musicians featuring Mike Marsh (The Avett Brothers) on drums, Paul Defiglia (The Avett Brothers) on stand up bass, Critter Fuqua (Old Crow Medicine Show) on banjo and accordion as well as some up and coming Nashville session musicians Kyle Cox, Rachel Smith and Avery Bright. I will be offering similar perks for those of you who wanted to contribute but were unable last time as well as a couple of new ideas.   Needs & Wants... So like I said I need to raise $2500.00, I am nervous doing another campaign so soon, but confident in the support the songs and project have been receiving, especially having only played a hand full of shows. The funds will be spent as follows.
Mixing- $500.00
Mastering- $500.00
Pressing (getting the material on cd, and the artwork pressed to have physical copies to give to you and sell to others)- $1500.00
This is a once in a lifetime, or should I say a make or break opportunity for me to live a dream, for helping me get there I will make sure you are rewarded by receiving perks that will only be available through this campaign.
If we don't reach the goal, although I am confident in you guys!!! The funds will all still go toward the final processes in completing the EP.   Thumprints Like I said this is a dream and that's why I cannot and will not give up. I am a 31 year old father of 2 and if anything I want my kids to know that we are here to love and we are here to dream, and to pursue the dreams we are most passionate about. I want to show people that we don't have to settle for mediocrity. Regardless of age, race, disability, financial situation or what ever other excuses we use to hold our selves back, I want people to know we have to pursue what we are designed to do.
I wasn't as successful as Id like to have been with the last campaign, but that isn't stopping me, I will have some platforms in which I can promote to a bigger and more diverse audience and will take full advantage of those opportunities. But I believe having the opportunity to work with these great artist and the time and money people have put into this project is not at all in vain. The success was being able to record the three songs and we did that, now we just need to mix, master and press.

There are strength in numbers and beauty in helping someone achieve his or her dreams.
    Can't donate, don't want to or donated to the last... Already donated to the recording project earlier this year and can't afford to donate now? That is okay, you can still be a vital part of this campaign by sharing on any and all of your social networks and by using the indie go go share tools to get the word out and about.

I am from the thousand of hills of Rwanda to the Drogba city of Cote d'Ivoire and the Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe. I represent a blend of African cultures and I try to do the same with my music. Over the years, I constantly moved around, switched schools and travelled. With every change, I was always trying to find myself, my  identity, my home , and my voice.  At the time, little Diane was just very shy and reserved.</p><p> Until that one day I met Hip-Hop.</p><p>It was probably about 5pm, my brother switched on the TV screen like any usual day after school. There was this tall handsome man holding a baby in his hand and gesturing to a certain melody . His name was Tupac Shakur and the song was "" Brenda's got a Baby"". It had my little hands snapping along from beginning to end. I had no idea what he was saying, but it stuck with me. Even when I had to leave home and go to a foreign country.</p><p>Eight years later, it was the beginning of my teenage years, so my voice wanted to rebel but something was still holding me back. I remember that moment like yesterday. Words bottled in my mind, but an empty sound coming out of my mouth. Who knew that my second year at Jean de la Fontaine was going to be life changing. We were learning the recorder that year! It doesn’t sound exciting, and it wasn’t!</p><p>But I remember this one moment so clearly as  my classmate put up his hand and insisted that we learn something that applies to our generation. He said exactly what everyone was thinking. At the time, I only wished I had as much courage as him. A few weeks later, we dropped our recorders and learned the history of that same sound I loved so much, Hip Hop!</p><p>Fast-forward to 50 people looking at me with a microphone in my hand. My 11 year old voice resonating through the sound system and my friends waving their hands in the air.  I was at the right place at the right time. I was happy and I was found. I had gained courage and had a voice. I was ALIVE that summer day. </p><p>The question was then would I perform again? </p><p><b>THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING NEW: </b></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444526248/cr1ihhha4vpejutehlye.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p></p><strong>
</strong>In 2003, I discovered Missy D.<br/><p></p><p></p><p>Missy D was the voice that spoke up, stood up, and cheered for the people. Anything Diane couldn’t do,  Missy D could!  That day with the help of my good friend Dhoha, we rebelled , we sang, we rapped, we performed and voiced out our message!</p><p>“ Dans ton hip hop,le microphone c’est comme le telephone,</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Tu parles, tu bouges, c’est comme les vacances!</span></p><p>Le hip hop c’est pas du pop! c’est de la bonne musique...”</p><p>Chorus:</p><p>Pour tu ce qui nous kiffe </p><p>ou qui ne kiffe kiffe pas</p><p>on s’en fiche on s’en fout</p><p>ca nous touche pas du tout</p><p>My first performance was catharsis. It liberated me. It let out this voice that was hidden for the past years! As soon as my voice got out, It didn’t want to hide anymore. I wrote constantly from sonnets, poems to raps in my little yellow music book. My voice grew, my performances multiplied and I became a regular performer just at 14.  Suddenly as I found comfort in French Hip Hop, my parents switched me to a different school, an english school.</p><p>Although I was comfortable with my French mic, I still didn’t speak much to the strangers, locals, taxi drivers, or any other english speakers. I remember going to church , praying in French while trying to translate what the priest was saying.  All I heard and understood was Hope. Like praying, my voice stayed internal for the next few months. With hope, I kept challenging myself by translating anything I heard. I fell in love with music once more. Sitting down in my dad’s office, I translated Usher and 50 Cent songs with a dictionary next to me. I didn’t attend any ESL classes outside of school. My teacher was Hip-Hop. I learned English through Hip Hop.</p><p>That summer, I grabbed my microphone again and rapped in English. I didn’t know a lot of expressions, similes,  idioms and metaphors  in English. With just hope and hip-hop, I introduced Missy D to this anglophone audience. </p><p>“ There u go, u talking to the rapper girl, </p><p>I can flow in french and english, I’m waiting to speaking spanish </p><p>Fast or slow, here we go, yo!</p><p>you are waiting for a rap, you better start to clap...”</p><p>Once again, Missy D spoke up for the new girl Diane. I continued to write raps  to inspire, to purge and also to have fun throughout high school. You would find me rapping about chemistry and economics. It was a way of studying , understanding these foreign theories while rhyming to a melody.  This was more than just a form of expression, it became my identity.  The same way that Hip Hop gave me life, I hope my music can do the same for any listener. </p><p><b>WHAT NOW?:</b></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444512477/hgxyty4kf9swt9zx0eie.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 510px; height: 510px;""/></strong></p><p></p><p>It's been 12 years, I now know more english vocab words and can formulate a full sentence.

</p><p> Le Lien: Indie Alt. Rock - Next
Single (UPDATED 11-9-15)<br/></p>
<p><b>Planned Release in 2016</b></p>
<p><b><u>Why I Need Your Help</u></b></p><p>We have plans now to work on my next
single release! My music manager Tony Peterson of ND Script Entertainment has connected
me with Bob Tucker and Jane Getz. </p>
<p><b>Bob Tucker </b>is a producer and guitar player with astonishing music credits. Bob recorded and mixed The
Temptations' Grammy winning album Ear-Resistible and platinum album. Bob Tucker
has shaped the sound of such hits as Tupac Shakur’s “Keep Your Head Up,” “Pour
Out A Little Liquor,” “Dear Mama,” and the remix “I Get Around.” His credits
also include India Arie ""I am Not My Hair"" and ""This Is My
Testimony Vol.1""</p>
<p><b>Jane Getz</b> is a singer &amp; songwriter who also has amazing credits. Jane
has recorded a number 1 album with John Lennon. Jane has also worked with Ringo
Starr, Herbie Mann, Charles Lloyd, Pharoah Sanders, the Bee Gees and she
received a recording contract with RCA.</p>
<p><b><u>This Next Single - Fire (working title)</u></b></p>
<p>We are all excited about getting this
single recorded. This is not just another song that I will record and release.
It has the potential to be submitted for a Grammy nomination in 2016! Also we are going to do whatever we can to get these quality recordings placed in TV and film. <br/></p>
<p>As I mentioned, I do have a full-time
job but it only pays the cost of bills and rent. I had little to no savings at
the end of every month. With your help,
recording the next song for my eventual album will make it all possible.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p><p><b><u><b><u>Why you should help</u></b> &amp; How you can help<br/></u></b>
</p><p>On average it costs 3K to record, hire
musicians to produce &amp; master 1 quality song. You will be not only helping me but also some of the musicians and other team players I will employ to get this project going. Simply select a perk to contribute, get awesome stuff and the satisfaction of knowing that you'd helped like shake and bake! :)<br/></p>
<p><b><u>About Me &amp; My Music Career</u></b></p>
<p>As early as I can remember I have
been writing poetry and songs. I have been taking vocal lessons since age 8 and
would sit in front of my computer for hours writing songs. Music is everything
to me and I’ve put everything on the line to make my dreams come true. Since
moving to LA, I’ve had a building momentum of success.</p>
<p>In 2013 I had the pleasure to work
and learn with Mike Sullivan where we finished and recorded my song: ""Give
Me Your Love.""  It was the first single I released for sale
online digitally. It was something I've never done before and a milestone in my
career. </p>
<p>In 2014 Callin Passero of Dead Hello
and I teamed up to write “Somebody to Love”  and had the good fortune to get David Hildago from Distortion Track to play drums for the song. It was an amazing experience and one of my favorite songs. I will be
giving you a copy of the song at every level!!!! </p>
<p>In 2015 I sang at a party and met my
current manager. Our plan is to record an album in order to move my career to
the next level. As a part of the process, we will be doing just one song first.</p><p>I have a lot of soulful introspective lyrics where I want to add a small quartet with a four piece band. My soulful, rock and bluesy hearfelt songs are not out in the world yet. I know when you hear a quality recording that you helped create - you won't be let down.  <br/></p>
<p><b><u>Transparency</u></b><br/></p><p>I just updated this 11/9/2015. I recently received a loan to get my car fixed. Thanks to the generous support of others that I will respect and leave their names anonymous. Please know that I will still need to pay every cent of the borrowed money back.  I also have joinbreeze.com for a temporary ride. The payments are $200 a week for this leased car. Ouch! I know - HOWEVER - After some serious careful consideration I have decided to change the campaign just to cover music 100%.<br/></p><p>It's too late to change the amount so I will use all the funds to go towards an eventual EP.<br/></p><p> I WON'T QUIT!!!! So if the campaign doesn't fund I am still going to record this song but it might take much longer than anticipated.  However, some of you have asked how can you help. This is how. You CAN make a difference
in my life and my music will touch so many others' lives! #LevelUpLe

</p><p>Music is everything to me! Everyone involved will be so grateful you decided to help!!!!<br/></p>

Professional emotionalist with main topic ""Busking"".                                       Alex  Bassplayer and Banjo virtuoso Composer/better Singer than Igor, but these are just rumors ;) Our oldest member; he barely shows up these days, but that's his problem ;). He writes music scores for choirs, theater, films, string quartet, sometimes for us, diverse colleagues and for himself. They pay him! It's alright, he will come back to us for sure!!                                      Vladimir Accordion/unwilling to singBorn in the Ukraine (left bottom corner).Talks just after having guzzled three Augustiner beer and he's almost always in time. Nothing left to say. Laughs rarely (but loud). Slavonic. Melancholic.                                          Steffen Bass and Banjo player, arranger, music teacherdoesn't like himself on photos, doesn't like to be called ""the small basso"" , moans... we always earn good money with him.                                         Julian Lead Singer/ Piano PlayerMakes music since stepping on planet Earth . His mother Barbara is a professional concert pianist and daughter of the legendary tenor Fritz . His father Ron is singer, actor and entertainer.

broke  you are sometimes struck with the best ideas. That's when
creativity sets in. Indeed this  happened to us and voilà! we hit the
streets! No more waiting, anticipating, agents, calls, waiting again... We were
young, crazy and had success with it. Today we are a little less younger, a
little more crazier, bit still  completely successful with it.

          by Marco Jordan
Of
course there are good times and bad times, but such is life.However we are
serious musicians, who choose the streets as our stage, not because we have to but because we want to be close to YOU, our audience...
  YES YOU!

KONNEXION BALKON 
established in 1999 has in recent years  made its name as Munich's most famous street
Crosover Mashup Theatre!!

""I am having trouble  in defining KONNEXION BALKON properly"" says Igor and adds "" a geographical realm of our music is diffuse and disperse.... one could say continental European perhaps......aiming to feel and bring to the audience all this melancholy, with some crazy beats kicking in. 
We are so to speak free art, enabling everyone to enjoy the luxury of our music.And our Motto is Pay what you want ,when you want and how you want! We have to admit the more the better!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>KATZ Radio </i><span>is a Christian-Community radio station based out of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  The station is owned by Stretch Productions - a tenured media team comprised of Cami Bradley and her husband of 28 years, Randy.  In mid-2015, Cami and Randy began to expand their home production suite into the radio realm t</span>o accommodate the station’s 24/7 broadcast.  In November 2015, the station went live and its vast library of music and programming has continued to expand daily.</p>
<p>But sadly. December 2015 brought some unfortunate news for broadcasters nationwide…</p>
<p>The SWA (Small Webmaster’s Agreement) was a law that was in effect since 2007, but was not renewed for 2016.  This means stations like <i>KATZ Radio </i>are at risk of losing music licenses, and stations must go to each PRO (Performing Rights Organizations) <i>individually</i> to obtain these necessary licenses.  This decision was made by unelected judges who make up the CRB (Copyright Royalty Board).  Below we will provide more context about how this decision drastically increases the station's operating costs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444435749/io1fpefhrli9yrtpkvjm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How It Started</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Also in 2015 - but before the inception of <i>KATZ Radio</i> - Cami joined forces with her former radio partner John Roberts and began their original one-hour radio program titled <i>C</i><i>ome Praise The Lord.  </i>John Roberts has spent over 30 years in show business. His wealth of experience ranges from stage acting/theater production (including Broadway, the Fort Worth Opera and Casa Manana) to television producing and hosting an award-winning weekly cable television show in Dallas.  Cami Bradley's vast media background includes DJ and Broadcast Meteorologist at multiple Dallas/Fort Worth radio stations (including 50,000-watt clear-channel WBAP), as well as camera operator and voice-over work at KXAS-TV/NBC Channel 5 in Fort Worth.</p>
<div>
<p>It wasn’t long after the show’s launch that Cami had the dream of 24/7 airplay in the form of a radio station.  The station was to mirror the show’s format; featuring Christian-Classics (oldies!) that no other stations are actively highlighting.  Yes, there are “oldies” stations and shows, but not in the <span>Christian music format.  The core of the music library's content focuses on Southern Gospel and Contemporary Christian music.  But, the main focus of <i>KATZ Radio</i> is the local tie-in to the DFW area churches, as well as featuring both rising and established artists.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444435767/krvgsjsaph8reaje2hwf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
</div>
<p><b><i>A note from Cami Bradley:</i></b></p>
<p><i><span>“KATZ</span></i> <i>Radio</i> is Christian-Community Radio for DFW. Do we have music from your church? Each hour, we play choir and orchestra numbers (both new and old!), plus Praise &amp; Worship time with the congregations/praise bands alongside established Christian-Classic Hits from the 70s-90s! AND we give local DFW indie-artists some airplay too - as it is so hard to get on radio! Join us for the PURR-fect blend of music- and message me about our very inexpensive ad rates right now.</p>
<p>As soon as time and money allows this winter/spring, I will be adding some special tapes donated to <i>KATZ  </i>from some important historical radio and TV stations here in the metroplex. I have some original shows and clips - ranging from 7 minutes to an hour in length! For the TV shows, I can pull the audio off for radio.</p>
<p>And although mostly <i>KATZ </i> is music - I do want to add just a few teaching slots as well. I've already talked with one or two of you about this!)  And so far, we have music from the following churches in the Ft. Worth/Dallas metroplex: </p>
<p>Sagamore Hill (Ft. Worth), Bethesda (Ft. Worth), Christ Chapel (Ft. Worth), Harvest (Watauga), The Exchange (Keller), Fielder Road (Arlington), Fellowship (Grapevine), Gateway (N. FW -AND- Southlake campuses), White's Chapel (Southlake), 1st Baptist Grapevine, 1st Baptist Dallas, Shiloh Terrace (Dallas; at the Garland line), Prestonwood (Plano), and I have music from The Heights (Richardson) which I have not added yet but will. We are also very excited to be playing music from 1st Baptist Houston, Calvary Chapel Merritt Island Florida, St. Andrew, Panama City Florida, The Singing Men Of Texas, and The Singing Women Of Texas!</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>It’s easy to see that the world of media (and media <i>platforms</i>) is changing rapidly.  Previously, running <i>KATZ Radio</i> averaged around $200/month ($2,400 annually) and the SWA law covered all necessary music licenses for its broadcasting needs.  But <i>without</i> the help of the SWA law, here is a look at the upcoming costs:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$.17 cents per song, per 100 listeners</li>
<li>$500 annual minimum to SoundExchange</li>
<li>$1,200 annual minimum to PROs (ASCAP, SESAC, BMI)</li>
<li>$200 monthly costs previously mentioned</li>
<li>Hundreds of additional dollars for equipment, initial music purchases and engineers that repair and maintain the equipment </li>
</ul>
<div>
<i>For a “big picture"" breakdown on the above as well as the additional effects on the entire radio industry, check out these great articles:</i><p></p>
<p><i><a href=""http://www.radioworld.com/article/crb-ruling-is-%E2%80%9Ccrushingly-bad-news%E2%80%9D-for-microcasters/277856"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.radioworld.com/article/crb-ruling-is-“crushingly-bad-news”-for-microcasters/277856</a></i></p>
<p><i><a href=""http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2016/01/05/why-american-independent-internet-radio-may-go-extinct-in-2016/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2016/01/05/why-american-independent-internet-radio-may-go-extinct-in-2016/</a></i></p>
</div>
<p>After the successful launch of <i>KATZ Radio</i><i>’</i><i>s</i> flagship program <i>Come Praise The Lord,</i> Stretch Productions and their affiliates felt God pressing them to expand their reach.  While the launch of <i>KATZ Radio </i>has been an exciting step of obedience in that direction, the massive increase in costs due to the SWA law being dissolved is now a major barrier on the path.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the title suggests, <b>the entire goal is to keep <i>KATZ Radio</i> on the air.  For this to happen within the scope of the recent law changes, research shows it will average at least $475/month</b>. The financial goal of <b>$6,000 </b>is based on that number for one year of airplay (minus Indiegogo's fee after the funds are raised).</li>
<li>Your contribution will not go unnoticed.  <b>The Bible also teaches to ""give honor where honor is due.""  </b>Unless you wish to remain anonymous, <b>you will receive a special on-air ""thank you""</b> for you and/or your business.  You can find more about our rewards in the sidebar.</li>
<li>If the entire goal of $6,000 is not met, your special contribution <i>still</i> matters!  Even if a total of $6,000 is raised - which would average one week's airplay - that <i>one week</i> could reach <i>one person</i>. </li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452393534/d7e5db34vb875pvldj3n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges.</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Stretch Productions and their affiliates are completely and confidently equipped in both experience <i>(and</i> spirit) to ""press on"" towards what the Lord has called them to do.</li>
<li>While they are so thankful for <i>KATZ Radio’s</i> progress-to-date, without the necessary funding, the station will be at risk of losing its licenses and going dark.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, it's understood that not everyone will be in a place to make a financial gift.<b> If you feel led to help keep <i>KATZ Radio</i> on the air, here are some <i>alternative</i> ideas on how you can get plugged in:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign on your personal/business social media pages.</li>
<li>Alert your local media about the mentioned changes in broadcasting and its effect on the future of <i>KATZ Radio</i>.</li>
<li>Pray for the broadcast and the listeners.</li>

""Listening to KATZ Radio is like being sucked up into a vortex of memories!""

Short Summary

KATZ Radio is a Christian-Community radio station based out of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  The station is owned by Stretch Productions - a tenured media team comprised of Cami Bradley and her husband of 28 years, Randy.  In mid-2015, Cami and Randy began to expand their home production suite into the radio realm to accommodate the station’s 24/7 broadcast.  In November 2015, the station went live and its vast library of music and programming has continued to expand daily.
But sadly. December 2015 brought some unfortunate news for broadcasters nationwide…
The SWA (Small Webmaster’s Agreement) was a law that was in effect since 2007, but was not renewed for 2016.  This means stations like KATZ Radio are at risk of losing music licenses, and stations must go to each PRO (Performing Rights Organizations) individually to obtain these necessary licenses.  This decision was made by unelected judges who make up the CRB (Copyright Royalty Board).  Below we will provide more context about how this decision drastically increases the station's operating costs.


How It Started

Also in 2015 - but before the inception of KATZ Radio - Cami joined forces with her former radio partner John Roberts and began their original one-hour radio program titled Come Praise The Lord.  John Roberts has spent over 30 years in show business. His wealth of experience ranges from stage acting/theater production (including Broadway, the Fort Worth Opera and Casa Manana) to television producing and hosting an award-winning weekly cable television show in Dallas.  Cami Bradley's vast media background includes DJ and Broadcast Meteorologist at multiple Dallas/Fort Worth radio stations (including 50,000-watt clear-channel WBAP), as well as camera operator and voice-over work at KXAS-TV/NBC Channel 5 in Fort Worth.

It wasn’t long after the show’s launch that Cami had the dream of 24/7 airplay in the form of a radio station.  The station was to mirror the show’s format; featuring Christian-Classics (oldies!) that no other stations are actively highlighting.  Yes, there are “oldies” stations and shows, but not in the Christian music format.  The core of the music library's content focuses on Southern Gospel and Contemporary Christian music.  But, the main focus of KATZ Radio is the local tie-in to the DFW area churches, as well as featuring both rising and established artists.


A note from Cami Bradley:
“KATZ Radio is Christian-Community Radio for DFW. Do we have music from your church? Each hour, we play choir and orchestra numbers (both new and old!), plus Praise & Worship time with the congregations/praise bands alongside established Christian-Classic Hits from the 70s-90s! AND we give local DFW indie-artists some airplay too - as it is so hard to get on radio! Join us for the PURR-fect blend of music- and message me about our very inexpensive ad rates right now.
As soon as time and money allows this winter/spring, I will be adding some special tapes donated to KATZ  from some important historical radio and TV stations here in the metroplex. I have some original shows and clips - ranging from 7 minutes to an hour in length! For the TV shows, I can pull the audio off for radio.
And although mostly KATZ  is music - I do want to add just a few teaching slots as well. I've already talked with one or two of you about this!)  And so far, we have music from the following churches in the Ft. Worth/Dallas metroplex: 
Sagamore Hill (Ft. Worth), Bethesda (Ft. Worth), Christ Chapel (Ft. Worth), Harvest (Watauga), The Exchange (Keller), Fielder Road (Arlington), Fellowship (Grapevine), Gateway (N. FW -AND- Southlake campuses), White's Chapel (Southlake), 1st Baptist Grapevine, 1st Baptist Dallas, Shiloh Terrace (Dallas; at the Garland line), Prestonwood (Plano), and I have music from The Heights (Richardson) which I have not added yet but will. We are also very excited to be playing music from 1st Baptist Houston, Calvary Chapel Merritt Island Florida, St. Andrew, Panama City Florida, The Singing Men Of Texas, and The Singing Women Of Texas!




What We Need & What You Get

It’s easy to see that the world of media (and media platforms) is changing rapidly.  Previously, running KATZ Radio averaged around $200/month ($2,400 annually) and the SWA law covered all necessary music licenses for its broadcasting needs.  But without the help of the SWA law, here is a look at the upcoming costs:


$.17 cents per song, per 100 listeners
$500 annual minimum to SoundExchange
$1,200 annual minimum to PROs (ASCAP, SESAC, BMI)
$200 monthly costs previously mentioned
Hundreds of additional dollars for equipment, initial music purchases and engineers that repair and maintain the equipment 


For a “big picture"" breakdown on the above as well as the additional effects on the entire radio industry, check out these great articles:
http://www.radioworld.com/article/crb-ruling-is-“crushingly-bad-news”-for-microcasters/277856
http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2016/01/05/why-american-independent-internet-radio-may-go-extinct-in-2016/

After the successful launch of KATZ Radio’s flagship program Come Praise The Lord, Stretch Productions and their affiliates felt God pressing them to expand their reach.  While the launch of KATZ Radio has been an exciting step of obedience in that direction, the massive increase in costs due to the SWA law being dissolved is now a major barrier on the path.

As the title suggests, the entire goal is to keep KATZ Radio on the air.  For this to happen within the scope of the recent law changes, research shows it will average at least $475/month. The financial goal of $6,000 is based on that number for one year of airplay (minus Indiegogo's fee after the funds are raised).
Your contribution will not go unnoticed.  The Bible also teaches to ""give honor where honor is due.""  Unless you wish to remain anonymous, you will receive a special on-air ""thank you"" for you and/or your business.  You can find more about our rewards in the sidebar.
If the entire goal of $6,000 is not met, your special contribution still matters!  Even if a total of $6,000 is raised - which would average one week's airplay - that one week could reach one person. 




Risks & Challenges.


Stretch Productions and their affiliates are completely and confidently equipped in both experience (and spirit) to ""press on"" towards what the Lord has called them to do.
While they are so thankful for KATZ Radio’s progress-to-date, without the necessary funding, the station will be at risk of losing its licenses and going dark.








Other Ways You Can Help
Of course, it's understood that not everyone will be in a place to make a financial gift. If you feel led to help keep KATZ Radio on the air, here are some alternative ideas on how you can get plugged in:

Share our campaign on your personal/business social media pages.
Alert your local media about the mentioned changes in broadcasting and its effect on the future of KATZ Radio.
Pray for the broadcast and the listeners.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Will you help me reach the world with my gift of song?! I’m Delores Harris,
also known as Lady Dee. I’ve been singing since the age of 4, professionally
since the age of 15. I’m also an actress of stage plays and independent films.
In my former day job, as a Pre K- 8<sup>th</sup> grade principal, I was known
as ( and am still known as) Dr. Harris. Although I’ve been performing and
recording intermittently, both individually and with groups, most of my time
has been spent raising my two sons and being a dedicated educator. At one time,
in the eighties, my group, Everlife, was even signed to 20<sup>th</sup> Century
Fox. However, that relationship just wasn’t meant to be. I’m The Detroit Black
Music Awards’ August 2014 to August 2015 R&amp;B Female Vocalist of the Year,
and was a 2012 nominee. I am also the 2014 Torch Foundation’s Cultural Award
winner for using my vocal gift (at no charge) as a way to encourage others to
financially support efforts for student educational and social development
programs. As the 2011 winner of the Radio One/Detroit Tigers Singing Stars
Competition; I performed the National Anthem at a Detroit Tigers’ game. I have
also performed the National Anthem for the Detroit Pistons!  I have graced the same stages as, and/or with
The Calloways and other members of Midnight Star, Sir Nose, After 7, actor Leon
Robinson, Martha Reeves, Spyder Turner, The Contours and The Original
Vandellas, Patti Austin, Sheila Raye Charles (daughter of Ray Charles) and
Smokey Robinson. </p>
<p>Now, I’m
ready to sing and perform for the world, but don’t have the funds to support my
dream, being on pension. Many of my friends and associates have made to stardom
or close to it over the years while I was focused on my children and day job.
One in particular who is a Grammy-award winning, platinum selling artist,
songwriter and producer, has written a song just for me! Not only do I need
funds for the use of the song, but I need it for production and legal costs
that are necessary to properly complete and release the project. This huge
expense, minimally $10,000, has prompted me to realize that releasing a single
first, rather than a full EP (album) is at least a way to get started.</p>
<p>I claim and
have faith that this single release and future projects will not only reach the
world, but will chart well! With a product to share, I can even more easily be
booked by promoters and agencies, giving me the opportunity to travel around
the world to perform. Before I leave this plane of existence, I want this for
myself and others whose hearts my music may reach. I’ve spent my days helping
others and their children. Now, I need help! Be a part of making my dream come

your help we will be able to produce a great video that will open a new page in
DESERT history.

To cover the production expenses we need 10 000 €.
As much funds we will raise from the campaign - 
we will afford bigger production. If we’ll rise more than 10 000 €
- rest of the funds will be invested in our upcoming European tour with Circle
II Circle and Lord Volture.
In exchange of your help we prepared for you some
unique stuff, most of it (like “Son Of A Star” tshirt)were prepared specially
for the campaign funders and will be available only for them!!!  Victoria constat in legionum virtute (Victory depends of legions’ valor)Gaius Julius Caesar

<p>My name is Wren Wilder and I've been creating music for as long as I can remember. My family loved music deeply and was responsible for introducing me to the artists that influenced and inspired me the most.  I woke up to Billie Holiday on vinyl every morning as my mother cooked up breakfast. In the evening, my family would listen to Bob Marley's, <i>Legend</i>, while we lit the tiki torches and told our stories. Music was always a storytelling device and when my family went through its transformations, it became the only way of communicating with the world that felt organic and real. </p>

<p>My father, as a singer-songwriter himself, practiced with his band in the basement under my bedroom while I tried to fall asleep. He and my bonus (step) mother would plan out weekends filled with nonstop music for my brother and I. Together, we discovered countless musicians who molded my ears, as a young musician, and that's when I knew I wanted to make music forever.</p>

<p>I had always been a performer since I can remember. My mom had me taking dance classes, violin lessons, piano lessons, all the clubs and activities that involved me on a stage!</p>

<p>When I turned thirteen, my mother asked if I had any interest in taking voice lessons. Her best friend had a niece who was starting a career in vocal training. I was her first student and I trembled for hours trying to complete my first assignment: Sing for my parents (OUT LOUD). Five years later, mom held my hand as I auditioned for 13 music conservatories around the world as a double major in Jazz Voice and Music Recording Technology. The rest is history, as they say. </p>

<p>Let me start with this so you can understand who I am as a human. I don't think of hurdles as problems. There are no problems but only solutions. That's my mantra and it's done me good this far! That being said, here are the hurdles I'm preparing for along the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hypothetically Let's Say: There's some reason I can not record at the studio (natural disaster, act of God, what have you). </strong>In this situation, my first instinct would be to hire another studio out and keep the creative team that has been with me on this journey. Being a sound designer for film, I have a vast network of studios in the Los Angeles area to facilitate on short notice.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hypothetically Let's Say: The team for some reason becomes unavailable (family emergencies, act of God, let's hope not!). </strong>Thankfully, I have talked to a few teams about this project and they are all very familiar with my work and expectations. If, for some reason, I have to, I will pull on those awesome folks to save the day. </li>

Oh and did we happen to mention recently she donned the producer’s hat and she also sings."" - Riveting Riffs Interview 
 
                        

​@evaboneva
This is Eva Toorenent, (AKA Eva Boneva) and she is an artist of the weird and the wonderful. She loves to create curious creatures and other weird stuff. Eva 's art style is described as pop-surrealism with a touch of creepiness. She's inspired by her favorite artists Rien Poortvliet, Brian Froud and Tony Diterlizzi.
Eva works with all different kinds of materials, styles and mediums, 2D and 3D. Her favorite is a combination between watercolor and digital. With her art and stories, she focuses on blurring the lines between our world and the other world.
                         

Meet @Johnfurth :  a freelance photographer based in Los Angeles. A few years ago he took Photo 1 at SMC and started shooting city-scapes.   Now John works in a full range of photographic styles; although, he finds himself drawn towards lifestyle branding and the ability to blend beauty, story, and functionality.  John fully believes that great photographs are driven by the stories they tell. 
 

In this process, we will be hustling to promote the album and campaign.  I will be giving away free records from my favorite female singer-songwriters to promote other women who love and appreciate audio! We will also be collaborating with local artists, photographers, and local businesses who love the new album and want to show their support! 
Be sure to check out the perks on the right. We are definitely working for every penny you donate and offering some pretty cool swag. Be sure to look at our Release Party option because it's going to be such a blast! 












Here's a breakdown of what we will use the funding for: 


Recording Studio Fee: $5900
This will cover the cost of the studio, engineers, and mix/master process


Session Players Fee: $4500
This is to pay all of the talented, professional musicians that join us in the recording process


Distribution: $2600
Creating the Wren-Merchandise after we record to start sending out to you! 



Let me start with this so you can understand who I am as a human. I don't think of hurdles as problems. There are no problems but only solutions. That's my mantra and it's done me good this far! That being said, here are the hurdles I'm preparing for along the way.


Hypothetically Let's Say: There's some reason I can not record at the studio (natural disaster, act of God, what have you). In this situation, my first instinct would be to hire another studio out and keep the creative team that has been with me on this journey. Being a sound designer for film, I have a vast network of studios in the Los Angeles area to facilitate on short notice.

Hypothetically Let's Say: The team for some reason becomes unavailable (family emergencies, act of God, let's hope not!). Thankfully, I have talked to a few teams about this project and they are all very familiar with my work and expectations. If, for some reason, I have to, I will pull on those awesome folks to save the day.

<p><strong>The JMI Youth Big Band</strong> presents Jewish music as you’ve never heard it before. This is the next generation of musical superstars, breaking ground and redefining music of Jewish origin.<br/> </p>
<p>“<i>A radical revelation! They play with an assurance, fluency and confidence rarely seen from such youthful ensembles.</i>” – <strong>Max Reinhardt, BBC Radio 3</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the Jewish Music Institute we’re passionate about music and passionate about the development of our flagship youth project - the JMI Youth Big Band.</p>
<p>The band - made up of 12 - 18 year olds who play drums, bass, guitar, piano, tuba, saxophone, trumpet and trombone - was created in Summer 2017 to bring a contemporary edge to music of Jewish origin and enable talented young musicians from a wide variety of different backgrounds to explore a rich musical and cultural heritage whilst performing at the highest level. </p>
<p>Tzadik label artist, composer, trumpeter and band leader <strong>Sam Eastmond</strong> (Spike Orchestra, Gulgoleth) has expertly honed the ensemble to a remarkable degree in the short time since its formation. The debut album - featuring an array of expert musicians from the jazz and cutting edge new music scene including; <strong>Jon Madof </strong>(guitar), <strong>Moss Freed</strong> (guitar), <strong>Josephine Davies</strong> (saxophone), <strong>Mike Wilkins</strong> (saxophone) and <strong>Andy Watts</strong> (Trumpet) - is a true testament to Sam's talent as an arranger, collaborator, educator and inspirational figurehead. </p>
<p>We are all eager to document the band's momentous journey but we need your help to realise this project.</p>
<p>Recording an album is an expensive business, rehearsing, recording and preparing a band this size is a labour of love for us but we can’t pay the studio fees with love alone. The money raised in this campaign will turn our ambitious plans into a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why now?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>In the two years since it first formed, the band has gone from strength to strength. They have performed to crowds of more than 5000 people (Klezmer in the Park), recorded and released their debut single <i>""Stronger Together""</i> for charity in December 2018, and are currently being requested for gigs at prestigious venues all over London and throughout the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>We feel the band are ready to take the next steps to becoming a fully established and recognised ensemble with the release of their first studio album. None of the members had ever had any experience of recording before they joined the band, and only a small number had any experience of performing in a large ensemble in front of huge crowds.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME...</strong></p>
<p> Hello Sound Traveler my name is  Jay Rodriguez  born Hernan Ramiro Rodriguez-Sierra in Colombia, South America.</p>
<p>My family brought me to NYC/Tristate area at the age of 3.   NYC is my home.</p>
<p> I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of creating  music and to have  performed all over the world. My first professional jobs began in  8th grade in Latin scene. By the time I was 18 I had worked with Latin Legends like Celia Cruz and Ray Barretto . I went on to work with artists like Prince , Elvis Costello , The Mingus Big Band, Guru among many others.</p>
<p> Suffice to say music marked every aspect of my life in the most beautiful unique way.  Where other's  memories were visual mine were auditory.  Pitches and rhythms had tangible colors and shapes in my minds eye.</p>
<p> I performed with some of the most amazing artists known and unknown from almost all genres. My first musical  experiences were in the Latin music scene. Nonetheless I was exposed to  Bird , John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley to name a few  by the age of 10. I fell on love with all music. The father of the great Jazz Legend Paquito D Rivera took me under his wing. I went on to study with the great Joe Allard, and Phil Woods among many.</p>
<p>For a time, I believed that music was the only thing that mattered. As time passed, I came to the realization  that the opposite was true. It was the beginning of a deeper understanding and mission as an artist. It was life that gave birth and dispersed  it's light and casted shadows onto the tapestry of the song and sounds that live within  and around us all.</p>
<p>Although it may seem to some, that  I have waited a longtime to release a solo recording as a leader, it is not entirely accurate. I actually have played quite a lot  as a leader and composer. This is the first time that I am attempting to do it correctly with an awareness and experience.  I did not possess this  before. It has been an interesting  journey for me as an artist to have a level of self acceptance as i evolved as an artist.</p>
<p>      <strong> Reasons for needing your support.....</strong></p>
<p><font>The record has had the highest chart debut on record in the nation in a long time. It hit 22 on its second week. The New York Times  music critics  Nate Chinen and Giovanni Russonello have given it their  blessings .  Renowned jazz journalist Howard Mandel blessed me with  the liner notes. </font></p>
<p><font> I have taken it as far as I can with the help of some really amazing people and friends in this field and others that have shown me how much they really wanted to hear my first solo recording as a leader. Their compassion towards me and my vision/sound have left me besides myself.</font></p>
<p><font>​ I am moved deeply in my heart by the great generosity  of my peers ,colleagues and fans.</font></p>
<p><font>This is for all of you.</font></p>
<p><font>They know all too well that the recording may fall by the way side without ever reaching its full potential without your support.. </font></p>
<p><font> This campaign's funds  will be used  for PR ,marketing, promotional materials, radio promotion, mailings and tour support .</font></p>
<p><i><u>I have a lot of great perks to share ,amazing  beautiful signed posters signed by myself and the artist , I can record on your latest track or perform a solo concert distance allowing,  I can send you special remixes  and unedited versions of the music on the record. I can give you  flute ,saxophone ,theory and or composition lessons.  check the perks .</u></i></p>
<p><i> I  have varying levels  from  $5.00 to  $1000.00</i></p>
<p> I need your help and contributions to spread my music and message. It will be close to impossible to do it without you. The music  industry has changed drastically for many reasons and other  inevitable factors. It has its pros and cons, but doesn't everything?</p>
<p>With the music industry of today ,I  now have to  do all the things that a record company would have done  such as  pay for  radio and publication promotion and ads, marketing ,management and basic touring costs. I never had to do this in the past. I never imagined that I would have had  to ask  people to be patrons of the arts.Which you will surely be if you donate and or spread the word about my campaign .</p>
<p><strong>My Evolution as an Artist......</strong></p>
<p> I personally have been an optimist all my life.  As long as I create and work at being a part of the solution I so desperately seek in everyday life , the music and the world around me will take care of me and my family.This has been my experience. I have had a bit of that which I am eternally grateful for.</p>
<p>That is more then enough.This awareness has given me so much to live and strive for.Without the right support  emotionally and spiritually, I would not have been  able to accomplish anything as a human being or an artist.</p>
<p>I often wondered to myself , where do I belong as a composer, musician and a channel of this wonderful gift of music  ? With all the pain , injustices and disparities in this big blue world of ours , what is my purpose? Why should this matter so much to anyone ?</p>
<p>   I had arrived to a place inside myself where playing music was not be enough. What use was it to play,compose and perform ? What I did seemed empty and shallow in the midst of our human sufferings and struggles.  I could no longer accept music for music's sake.  I could not bare to play or feel knowing that my brothers and sisters all over this world would be suffering.There had to be more to what I did as an artist besides trying to inspire change. I wanted and needed to be the change not just to inspire it. I began working and doing volunteer work  in between my performances and musical obligations with foster kids of all ages with young men and women coming in and out of incarceration and other adversities.  I have done this now for a little over 20 years . It has been a part of my life . It was not ever planned. I just did what was in front of me.</p>
<p>The music of life was at hand ! It was bigger then I could have ever fathomed. It was always a part of me as it was a part of the world around me . In conclusion I came to the realization that I was not teaching others anything that they already did not  know.</p>
<p> It was my job to shine a light on those things that made us human. It was a lesson of  awareness , consciousness , compassion and blind faith in the process of the universe.</p>
<p>The deeper my ability to tell my story through my art the closer the relationship to the music of life was achieved . My purpose became clear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About this Recording...</strong></p>
<p>This record has been a cathartic experience. Never did I realize how important it was to do what I did as a saxophonist,flautist and composer.</p>
<p>This record is dedicated to all  of humanity . Your Sound is the music that lives within all of us. That thing within us that makes us ponder on the hues of the sky at dawn upon awakening  or at dusk that say i am going to tell and show you that this world and its life all encompassing is worth living for ,no matter how hard  it may seem to be .  It is about us dreamers and conjurers of beauty ,empathy and hope in action.</p>
<p>I was told once that there was a time when you could hear the murmur of the stars.</p>
<p>"" Your Sound "" is about that murmur. After all when we look up at stars don't we realize that we are of them and they are of us. Life is breathtaking and music is one beautiful way to make a difference.</p>
<p>I believe now that the sound of the humanity is the thing that flows through me , you and all things. </p>
<p>Being a soloist and composer  is a sacred beautiful thing.</p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have  studied life through music and music through life. I have become a respected </span>artist<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in my </span>field<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. It has never been easy. The music </span>matured<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> as I matured, at least </span>this was<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> my case.I had my ups and downs like all human beings. I </span>have<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> a feeling that is what makes life a sound. After all </span>musicians<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> are </span>people<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> too. </span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Music is the </span>noblest of professions. I found this to be part of my message on this record. Although I have played an integral part of many great artist's music, I had never really done a real solo recording as leader in the jazz idiom. I have played many  solos on many records and performances . It has been a privilege and always will be. This  recording is my statement and story to you.</font></p>
<p><font>I was a cofounder of a great  band from NYC called  Groove Collective. They heralded in the fusion of jazz, hip hop and other urban genres . </font> I feel that I have played an important part in the aesthetics of the music scene in NYC.</p>
<p><font>​This live recording at Dizzy's Club Coca Cola  featured some of the world's jazz masters . It was an honor to have some of my friends and colleagues on this journey. The artist are   Billy Martin on percussion known as part of the groundbreaking trio Medeski, Martin and Wood , then there is Jazz legend tenor saxophonist Billy Harper as my tandem reed player known for his work with the great Lee Morgan among others, followed by none other master pianist Larry Willis known for his work with everyone from Roy Hargrove to Blood Sweat Tears then there is  the young lion Eric Wheeler on Bass known for his work  DD Bridgewater and Trumpet star Theo Croker .and to finish the line up as if that were not enough ,we have the dynamic Jt Lewis on drums known for his work with Herbie Hancock to  Vanessa Williams among others.</font></p>
<p><font>This is quite  a recording and band.</font></p>
<p><font> I really wanted to let everyone tell their story . It was a tough feat given time restrictions of  making a live record.I wanted to make a live recording that spoke to all people  past , present and future. </font></p>
<p><font>It had to have  peaks and valleys. I wanted it to reflect our times sad and joyous. I did not want my music to be about music . I wanted  the recording and statement to be about life .I think we achieved something very close.  This may be perhaps  why some radio stations around the nation have received it so enthusiastically.</font></p>
<p><font>The record has had the highest chart debut on record in the nation in a long time. It hit 22 on its second week. The New York Times  music critics  Nate Chinen and Giovanni Russonello have given it their  blessings .  Renowned jazz journalist Howard Mandel blessed me with  the liner notes. </font></p>

<p><font>​ I am moved deeply in my heart by the great generosity  of my peers and colleagues. I am doing this for them and all of you.</font></p>

ABOUT ME...
 Hello Sound Traveler my name is  Jay Rodriguez  born Hernan Ramiro Rodriguez-Sierra in Colombia, South America.
My family brought me to NYC/Tristate area at the age of 3.   NYC is my home.
 I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of creating  music and to have  performed all over the world. My first professional jobs began in  8th grade in Latin scene. By the time I was 18 I had worked with Latin Legends like Celia Cruz and Ray Barretto . I went on to work with artists like Prince , Elvis Costello , The Mingus Big Band, Guru among many others.
 Suffice to say music marked every aspect of my life in the most beautiful unique way.  Where other's  memories were visual mine were auditory.  Pitches and rhythms had tangible colors and shapes in my minds eye.
 I performed with some of the most amazing artists known and unknown from almost all genres. My first musical  experiences were in the Latin music scene. Nonetheless I was exposed to  Bird , John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley to name a few  by the age of 10. I fell on love with all music. The father of the great Jazz Legend Paquito D Rivera took me under his wing. I went on to study with the great Joe Allard, and Phil Woods among many.
For a time, I believed that music was the only thing that mattered. As time passed, I came to the realization  that the opposite was true. It was the beginning of a deeper understanding and mission as an artist. It was life that gave birth and dispersed  it's light and casted shadows onto the tapestry of the song and sounds that live within  and around us all.
Although it may seem to some, that  I have waited a longtime to release a solo recording as a leader, it is not entirely accurate. I actually have played quite a lot  as a leader and composer. This is the first time that I am attempting to do it correctly with an awareness and experience.  I did not possess this  before. It has been an interesting  journey for me as an artist to have a level of self acceptance as i evolved as an artist.
       Reasons for needing your support.....
The record has had the highest chart debut on record in the nation in a long time. It hit 22 on its second week. The New York Times  music critics  Nate Chinen and Giovanni Russonello have given it their  blessings .  Renowned jazz journalist Howard Mandel blessed me with  the liner notes. 
 I have taken it as far as I can with the help of some really amazing people and friends in this field and others that have shown me how much they really wanted to hear my first solo recording as a leader. Their compassion towards me and my vision/sound have left me besides myself.
​ I am moved deeply in my heart by the great generosity  of my peers ,colleagues and fans.
This is for all of you.
They know all too well that the recording may fall by the way side without ever reaching its full potential without your support.. 
 This campaign's funds  will be used  for PR ,marketing, promotional materials, radio promotion, mailings and tour support .
I have a lot of great perks to share ,amazing  beautiful signed posters signed by myself and the artist , I can record on your latest track or perform a solo concert distance allowing,  I can send you special remixes  and unedited versions of the music on the record. I can give you  flute ,saxophone ,theory and or composition lessons.  check the perks .
 I  have varying levels  from  $5.00 to  $1000.00
 I need your help and contributions to spread my music and message. It will be close to impossible to do it without you. The music  industry has changed drastically for many reasons and other  inevitable factors. It has its pros and cons, but doesn't everything?
With the music industry of today ,I  now have to  do all the things that a record company would have done  such as  pay for  radio and publication promotion and ads, marketing ,management and basic touring costs. I never had to do this in the past. I never imagined that I would have had  to ask  people to be patrons of the arts.Which you will surely be if you donate and or spread the word about my campaign .
My Evolution as an Artist......
 I personally have been an optimist all my life.  As long as I create and work at being a part of the solution I so desperately seek in everyday life , the music and the world around me will take care of me and my family.This has been my experience. I have had a bit of that which I am eternally grateful for.
That is more then enough.This awareness has given me so much to live and strive for.Without the right support  emotionally and spiritually, I would not have been  able to accomplish anything as a human being or an artist.
I often wondered to myself , where do I belong as a composer, musician and a channel of this wonderful gift of music  ? With all the pain , injustices and disparities in this big blue world of ours , what is my purpose? Why should this matter so much to anyone ?
   I had arrived to a place inside myself where playing music was not be enough. What use was it to play,compose and perform ? What I did seemed empty and shallow in the midst of our human sufferings and struggles.  I could no longer accept music for music's sake.  I could not bare to play or feel knowing that my brothers and sisters all over this world would be suffering.There had to be more to what I did as an artist besides trying to inspire change. I wanted and needed to be the change not just to inspire it. I began working and doing volunteer work  in between my performances and musical obligations with foster kids of all ages with young men and women coming in and out of incarceration and other adversities.  I have done this now for a little over 20 years . It has been a part of my life . It was not ever planned. I just did what was in front of me.
The music of life was at hand ! It was bigger then I could have ever fathomed. It was always a part of me as it was a part of the world around me . In conclusion I came to the realization that I was not teaching others anything that they already did not  know.
 It was my job to shine a light on those things that made us human. It was a lesson of  awareness , consciousness , compassion and blind faith in the process of the universe.
The deeper my ability to tell my story through my art the closer the relationship to the music of life was achieved . My purpose became clear.
 
About this Recording...
This record has been a cathartic experience. Never did I realize how important it was to do what I did as a saxophonist,flautist and composer.
This record is dedicated to all  of humanity . Your Sound is the music that lives within all of us. That thing within us that makes us ponder on the hues of the sky at dawn upon awakening  or at dusk that say i am going to tell and show you that this world and its life all encompassing is worth living for ,no matter how hard  it may seem to be .  It is about us dreamers and conjurers of beauty ,empathy and hope in action.
I was told once that there was a time when you could hear the murmur of the stars.
"" Your Sound "" is about that murmur. After all when we look up at stars don't we realize that we are of them and they are of us. Life is breathtaking and music is one beautiful way to make a difference.
I believe now that the sound of the humanity is the thing that flows through me , you and all things. 
Being a soloist and composer  is a sacred beautiful thing.
I have  studied life through music and music through life. I have become a respected artist in my field. It has never been easy. The music matured as I matured, at least this was my case.I had my ups and downs like all human beings. I have a feeling that is what makes life a sound. After all musicians are people too. 
Music is the noblest of professions. I found this to be part of my message on this record. Although I have played an integral part of many great artist's music, I had never really done a real solo recording as leader in the jazz idiom. I have played many  solos on many records and performances . It has been a privilege and always will be. This  recording is my statement and story to you.
I was a cofounder of a great  band from NYC called  Groove Collective. They heralded in the fusion of jazz, hip hop and other urban genres .  I feel that I have played an important part in the aesthetics of the music scene in NYC.
​This live recording at Dizzy's Club Coca Cola  featured some of the world's jazz masters . It was an honor to have some of my friends and colleagues on this journey. The artist are   Billy Martin on percussion known as part of the groundbreaking trio Medeski, Martin and Wood , then there is Jazz legend tenor saxophonist Billy Harper as my tandem reed player known for his work with the great Lee Morgan among others, followed by none other master pianist Larry Willis known for his work with everyone from Roy Hargrove to Blood Sweat Tears then there is  the young lion Eric Wheeler on Bass known for his work  DD Bridgewater and Trumpet star Theo Croker .and to finish the line up as if that were not enough ,we have the dynamic Jt Lewis on drums known for his work with Herbie Hancock to  Vanessa Williams among others.
This is quite  a recording and band.
 I really wanted to let everyone tell their story . It was a tough feat given time restrictions of  making a live record.I wanted to make a live recording that spoke to all people  past , present and future. 
It had to have  peaks and valleys. I wanted it to reflect our times sad and joyous. I did not want my music to be about music . I wanted  the recording and statement to be about life .I think we achieved something very close.  This may be perhaps  why some radio stations around the nation have received it so enthusiastically.
The record has had the highest chart debut on record in the nation in a long time. It hit 22 on its second week. The New York Times  music critics  Nate Chinen and Giovanni Russonello have given it their  blessings .  Renowned jazz journalist Howard Mandel blessed me with  the liner notes.

​ I am moved deeply in my heart by the great generosity  of my peers and colleagues. I am doing this for them and all of you.
They know all too well that the recording may fall by the way side and perhaps forgotten without ever reaching its full potential without your support . Or maybe not, Hey I am an optimist right ?!
 This campaign's funds  will be used  for PR ,marketing, promotional materials, radio promotion, mailings and tour support .

I can give you  flute ,saxophone ,theory and or composition lessons.  check the perks...!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.akoobooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Akoobooks Audio</a> is a leading publisher and digital distributor of African audiobooks. We want to transform books in Africa and get them to as many readers as possible on mobile devices.</p>
<p>We are a dedicated group of passionate African book lovers and creative professionals with over 25 years combined experience in the publishing, technology, entertainment and acting industries, pulling our skills together to make African voices heard in new and powerful ways. Our first audiobook, <a href=""http://bit.ly/2HXtx8k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Kenkey for Ewes' &amp; Other Very Short Stories</a>, is a collection of 50 contemporary Ghanaian stories that are considered to be some of the best published works on the <a href=""https://flashfictionghana.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flash Fiction Ghana Blog</a>. 'Kenkey for Ewes' is based around themes of modern African identity, love and respect for the dead, cruelty and greed and the enigmatic influence of fate and fortune.</p>
<h3>The 'Suma Went Walking' Audiobook</h3>
<p><strong>'Suma Went Walking'</strong> was written by my mother Nana Dadson and published by Afram Publications in 2002. She went blind ten years ago and is the reason I set up AkooBooks Audio-marrying my passion for books and technology, providing print disabled persons anywhere with access to more African writers and stimulating a 'digital reading' culture among African young people.</p>
<p>The story was written in English and has been translated into 8 languages. It tells the story of a girl Suma who takes a walk and meets animals who compare themselves to her. She gets tired of all the different things she is and eventually goes home where she is always little Suma. The story is written in English and has been translated to 4 different African languages and in French.</p>
<p>The idea of a pan-African symphonic story was inspired by Prokiev's 'Peter and the Wolf' which I love. I wanted to make a composition that would bring the magic and excitement of African musical instruments to children and provide an exciting new way to engage them with the performance of African music in schools. The duration is  approximately 30 minutes.</p>
<p>We have a stellar ensemble of Ghanaian musicians: </p>
<p><strong>Suma</strong> is represented by an ensemble of flutes (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRH7iGK5Mf4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atentenben</a> and Odurogyra)  played by Dela Botri<br/>The <strong>Elephant</strong> is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZsymyuWHlE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fontomfrom Drum </a>played by Dela Botri<br/>The <strong>Bird</strong> is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRH7iGK5Mf4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atentenben </a>Flute played by Dela Botri<br/>The <strong>Snake</strong> is the Odurogya Flute and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnE50Ho7RYM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shekere</a> played by Dela Botri and Worlali Konu<br/>The <strong>Giraffe</strong> is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-xOqXsz9yA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prempensua &amp; Gome Drum</a> played by Dela Botri and Worlali Konu<br/>The <strong>Mouse</strong> is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6y2NRHwMqg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seperewa </a>played by Baffuor Awuah Kyeremanten<br/>The <strong>Hedgehog </strong>is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr-P5sWx-V0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kalimba </a>('Thumb Piano') played by Worlali Konu</p>

<p>If you are able to contribute to our audiobook, everyone on the team sincerely thanks you – you are helping bring our vision of digital transformation to the African publishing industry to fruition and also to enhance the performance of African musical instruments in schools worldwide!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many African writers and  publishers have expressed their frustration with getting their books to readers due to expensive production costs. limited print runs and the lack of channels for distribution. Digital distribution provides new channels and opportunities for accessing new readers.</p>
<p>A growing group of passionate African parents and educators all over the world  are asking important questions and demanding more African music and culture be reflected in our school curriculum.  We want to bring the best performing artistes to our local schools and <br/>and provide children with direct access to outstanding African performers in workshops,<br/>classes, participatory and related community events.</p>
<p>The performances of Suma Went Walking will help enrich the knowledge of our own indigenous African musical instruments and educate the next generation of young African musicians and music lovers. We provide support to African musicians by supplying instruments to schools and bring communities together who enjoy African arts and music.</p>
<p>You can help by being a part of that change!</p>

Akoobooks Audio is a leading publisher and digital distributor of African audiobooks. We want to transform books in Africa and get them to as many readers as possible on mobile devices.
We are a dedicated group of passionate African book lovers and creative professionals with over 25 years combined experience in the publishing, technology, entertainment and acting industries, pulling our skills together to make African voices heard in new and powerful ways. Our first audiobook, 'Kenkey for Ewes' & Other Very Short Stories, is a collection of 50 contemporary Ghanaian stories that are considered to be some of the best published works on the Flash Fiction Ghana Blog. 'Kenkey for Ewes' is based around themes of modern African identity, love and respect for the dead, cruelty and greed and the enigmatic influence of fate and fortune.
The 'Suma Went Walking' Audiobook
'Suma Went Walking' was written by my mother Nana Dadson and published by Afram Publications in 2002. She went blind ten years ago and is the reason I set up AkooBooks Audio-marrying my passion for books and technology, providing print disabled persons anywhere with access to more African writers and stimulating a 'digital reading' culture among African young people.
The story was written in English and has been translated into 8 languages. It tells the story of a girl Suma who takes a walk and meets animals who compare themselves to her. She gets tired of all the different things she is and eventually goes home where she is always little Suma. The story is written in English and has been translated to 4 different African languages and in French.
The idea of a pan-African symphonic story was inspired by Prokiev's 'Peter and the Wolf' which I love. I wanted to make a composition that would bring the magic and excitement of African musical instruments to children and provide an exciting new way to engage them with the performance of African music in schools. The duration is  approximately 30 minutes.
We have a stellar ensemble of Ghanaian musicians: 
Suma is represented by an ensemble of flutes (Atentenben and Odurogyra)  played by Dela BotriThe Elephant is the Fontomfrom Drum played by Dela BotriThe Bird is the Atentenben Flute played by Dela BotriThe Snake is the Odurogya Flute and Shekere played by Dela Botri and Worlali KonuThe Giraffe is the Prempensua & Gome Drum played by Dela Botri and Worlali KonuThe Mouse is the Seperewa played by Baffuor Awuah KyeremantenThe Hedgehog is the Kalimba ('Thumb Piano') played by Worlali Konu
The Pig is the Talking Drum played by Dela BotriThe Tortoise is the Gonje played by the German violinist Thomas ""Kwame"" Woernle

But, I don't know any of these instruments! What's the difference between an Antenben and a Odurogya Flute you may ask? You can click on the links above to read more information, or watch a great 'how to' or demo video on each instrument.
If you are able to contribute to our audiobook, everyone on the team sincerely thanks you – you are helping bring our vision of digital transformation to the African publishing industry to fruition and also to enhance the performance of African musical instruments in schools worldwide!
The Impact
Many African writers and  publishers have expressed their frustration with getting their books to readers due to expensive production costs. limited print runs and the lack of channels for distribution. Digital distribution provides new channels and opportunities for accessing new readers.
A growing group of passionate African parents and educators all over the world  are asking important questions and demanding more African music and culture be reflected in our school curriculum.  We want to bring the best performing artistes to our local schools and and provide children with direct access to outstanding African performers in workshops,classes, participatory and related community events.
The performances of Suma Went Walking will help enrich the knowledge of our own indigenous African musical instruments and educate the next generation of young African musicians and music lovers. We provide support to African musicians by supplying instruments to schools and bring communities together who enjoy African arts and music.
You can help by being a part of that change!


What We Need & What You Get
We need $30,000 to make this dream a reality.  We have funded the pre-production and composition work for Suma Went Walking, but we need your help to get the audiobook through recording, mastering, post production and out to children in the world through our Workshops.
Any money raised in this campaign will go to the post production costs of Suma Went Walking and related activities to promoting the audiobook and getting it into the classroom, specifically:


Music and Sound Mix - We have the incredibly talented Ghanaian composer and 'flute magician' Yaw Dela Botri (https://www.facebook.com/yaw.botri) on board to compose the music for the 'Suma Went Walking audiobook' together with collaborating composer & music therapist Mawyurami Ocloo. We need to fund the recording, mix and production of the score they created and played with 7 other master musicians/performers listed above.

Narration, Studio Recording & Post Production. The money we raise will go to paying for the studio recording and post production. This will also pay our amazing multi cast Narrators  who will narrate in three languages including master story tellers: Amowi Philips, Mmofra Foundation  and singer Veronica Bain-Derby (English), film actor Adjetey Annang  and singer Alexia Quartey (Ga) and  spoken word artistes Nana Asase and Akua Safo (Twi) and of course our fabulous children.   We also plan to produce the book in as many African languages and other languages as we can too.

Suma Went Walking Enhanced Book and Music score (Limited Edition). This Enhanced book with the complete music score for Suma Went Walking will give background information and activities which directly engage children with Suma Went Walking and meet the learning objectives for English and Music curriculum at Key Stages I & II.  Children will learn to identify instruments and instrument families of the pan-African ensemble and about musical parameters - pitch, rhythm, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture and structure of African music.  This  limited edition copy (100 copies  only) will be signed by the author Nana Dadson, the  main composer flute magician Dela Botri, collaborating composers Mawu Ocloo, Kweku Aacht, Thomas Woernle & the original musicians. (100 copies only)

Suma Went Walking Workshops/Live Performance (3 Inaugural).  The aim of these workshops is to bring different schools, parents and families to plan three inaugural  performances of Suma Went Walking (in English, Twi and Ga languages) in collaboration with the Pan African Youth Orchestra.   The workshops will give children from three lucky schools, the opportunity to sing, play, explore perform music from by Suma Went Walking with the original composers/musicians, culminating in three live performances to be held at the National Theatre, Accra in November-December 2018.

The Making of Suma Went Walking Documentary Film – Shooting the making of the audiobook and the performance with interviews with key musicians on the various roles played by each instrument and tips for playing each theme.  We need to take the documentary into post production, the money raised will help cover editing costs, so that our film can be used as a powerful teaching tool to supplement the book.

<br/>
Can i tell you a story?<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time there was a musician who worked very hard. he believed 
that music was the best medicine for the people of the world and gave 
music from a place deep in his heart. Many other musicians called him 
names and treated him like he didn't belong, but he kept on because he 
believed in making music for the betterment of mankind.<br/>
<br/>
The human race became spoiled with free commodities and music became a 
less valued part of life in the modern society. They created machines 
that made music by pressing a button and all of a sudden ,music was free
 and any one could make it. The boy kept strumming his guitar and 
singing his notes like it was doing something good for the world. The 
rest of the world looked at him like he was a fool.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day, a sad thing happened and one of his guitar playing friends
 was sent to the heavens on short notice. After this occurrence, the boy
 decided to get in touch with one of his favorite Australian musicians 
and ask if he would help him to make a great musical journey on CD 
before he himself got called to the heavens.</strong><strong></strong><br/>

the universe with his guitar, his skateboard and his dreams.</a></strong></p>

Can i tell you a story?

Once upon a time there was a musician who worked very hard. he believed 
that music was the best medicine for the people of the world and gave 
music from a place deep in his heart. Many other musicians called him 
names and treated him like he didn't belong, but he kept on because he 
believed in making music for the betterment of mankind.

The human race became spoiled with free commodities and music became a 
less valued part of life in the modern society. They created machines 
that made music by pressing a button and all of a sudden ,music was free
 and any one could make it. The boy kept strumming his guitar and 
singing his notes like it was doing something good for the world. The 
rest of the world looked at him like he was a fool.

Then one day, a sad thing happened and one of his guitar playing friends
 was sent to the heavens on short notice. After this occurrence, the boy
 decided to get in touch with one of his favorite Australian musicians 
and ask if he would help him to make a great musical journey on CD 
before he himself got called to the heavens.

After 100'000 Bananas and a truckload of Goji berries..
The story continues to unfold, thankfully, gratefully, he moves through 
the universe with his guitar, his skateboard and his dreams.
Life's too short not to live your dreams,
Bless.
Before the train comes.
The Boy. A new journey begins. The creation of a new musical body and capture of sound in time and space. This is sure to be a great adventure that sets off new ideas, dreams and inventions in new directions. Join us for the journey through...""It was 12 months ago I decided to contact Nicky Bomba and ask him if he'd help me make a full length album. I didn't know what he would say, but i took the plunge and asked him anyway.  Now, 12 months later,  I am sitting in the studio after our 6th day of recording. So i am quite literally in the moment i dreamed of, making this album.

<p>...There lived a creative organization called Boston
Rock Opera. It provided the fair city of Boston with magical performances inspired by musicians from many backgrounds. They worked together to ensure that everyone involved, performer and audience member
alike, would behold the grandeur of the Boston music scene - while also having a rocking good time, of course. Then, after 10 years of shows, BRO was
cast under a dissolution spell and has been sleeping ever since. </p>
<p>In recent days, the spell was lifted and the
sleeping people of Boston Rock Opera awakened in haze of happy memories. However, they soon realized that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Believing in the power of music to inform and transform, BRO is refreshed and more ready than ever to unite the forces of Boston musicians to generate enchanting new productions for audiences and performers alike. <br/></p>
<p>It was time to rock again! So, the BRO joined forces with G-Rock
Music's Kameelah Benjamin-Fuller to begin telling a new story with an old one, to return to the stage with the revolutionary 1960s rock musical HAIR.  </p>
<p>Why HAIR? HAIR is the story the generation on the front lines
of the social overhaul of 1960s America; the Vietnam cannon fodder, the out-of-work kids, whose histories reverberate today. Media
overload, fear of technology, disgust with authority, sexual curiosity and drug use drove the alternative reality they created to keep the spectre of the draft and death away.
The BRO
passionately believes this musical will remind us that history forgotten repeats itself as politics, race, class and gender continue to stratify our society.  </p>
<p>Be a part
of this real life fairy tale! Boston Rock Opera has started this campaign to
allow us the space to create a vision that is singular and sends a
message to the world that we are all together on this journey. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need  </h3> <p>In our effort to support all things local, we have chosen to work with locavore restaurant Once/Cuisine En Locale as our performance venue. This is an intimate hall (275 seats) that will allow everyone to have the best seat in the house. However, this decision comes at a cost. Tickets sales, even if all the shows sell out, will not cover the full costs of presenting HAIR. Boston Rock Opera had years of experience staging theatrical rock, every dime raised in this campaign is already allocated to this production. The licensing for HAIR alone costs more than $3,000 and we have a lengthy budget of any typical musical production including lighting, sound, costumes, sets, rehearsal space and publicity.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, we are committed to allowing those who make this show happen - the cast, musicians and crew - to be paid for the amazing performance and service they provide!  When you help us, you help create a sustainable community through the arts.  In fact, you aren't just helping, you become a part of that community! </p>

En gros, l'objectif du
projet, c’est de produire un mini-album (EP) qui reflète l'évolution du Billy
Love Band depuis le lancement de son premier EP, en juin 2013. Au cours des 3
dernières années, le BLB a énormément évolué, et c’est le cas de le dire. Croyez-moi,
c’est pas le changement qui manque.  Le BLB en 2016, c'est la collision entre la douceur
d'un punch aux fruits et l'amertume d'un café pas de lait.</p>

</div></div>","Le projet, c’est quoi?






En gros, l'objectif du
projet, c’est de produire un mini-album (EP) qui reflète l'évolution du Billy
Love Band depuis le lancement de son premier EP, en juin 2013. Au cours des 3
dernières années, le BLB a énormément évolué, et c’est le cas de le dire. Croyez-moi,
c’est pas le changement qui manque.  Le BLB en 2016, c'est la collision entre la douceur
d'un punch aux fruits et l'amertume d'un café pas de lait.
Le projet, c’est qui?


Le Billy Love Band
c'est 
William Lamoureux - Violon et Voix 
Marianne Dumas -
Claviers
Benaias Lemma -
Guitare 
Jean-Philippe Lapensée
- Basse électrique 
Andrew Ferderber - Batterie. Pour l'album, la
musique est écrite par William Lamoureux, et les paroles sont un travail
collaboratif entre William et la plume de Fred Abel, un parolier de la région
de Gatineau.  Les arrangements sont un travail d'équipe impliquant tous
les membres du groupe et les deux co-réalisateurs, Drew Jurecka  et Joshua Van Tassel (plus de détails à leur sujet ci-bas).
Le projet, pourquoi on s’y met?


Depuis 2013, le Billy
Love Band s'est retrouvé lauréat de plusieurs concours, que ce soit Gatineau
Prend la Scène, L'école du Rock de Musique Plus ou la bourse Desjardins du
Festival de l'Outaouais Émergent.  On a aussi atteint aussi la demi-finale
du Festival International de la Chanson de Granby en 2014.  Avec le
nouveau EP, on aimerait tenter notre chance dans les grands festivals du Canada
français en 2017, et aussi participer à quelques vitrines qui nous aideront à
mettre notre nom sur la map. On voit clairement les possibilités d’atteindre nos
objectifs se multipliés avec la sortie du mini-album. La production du EP, ainsi
que la planification de ce que nous voulons réaliser, nous laissent croire que la fougue du BLB ne
fait que commencer.
Le projet, y coûte combien?



Évidemment, un projet
comme celui-ci, ça coûte un bras. Malheureusement, personne dans le groupe
s’est porté volontaire pour nous en donner un. Donc, on a besoin de votre aide
financière pour ce qui est du travail de production, post-production et la mise
en marché de l’album.  Le coût total du projet est estimé à 10000$. C'est
le coût de travailler avec la crème de la crème. On cherche à recueillir 5000$
avec le financement social.  Le reste des fonds viendra de la vente d'albums,
la vente de marchandise, ainsi que des spectacles de levée de fonds.
Les dépenses sont
distribuées plus ou moins comme suit (ne vous en faites pas, ce n’est pas les
musiciens qui ont fait le calcul): réalisation 30%; musiciens 25%; studio et
ingénieur 11%; mixage et mastérization 16%; design de la pochette et
reproduction de l'album 18%.


Y’a plusieurs façons
de nous donner un coup de main.

<p>Motivated by these early influences, I
began composing my own music at the age of 12. My style has evolved and
developed since my debut album at age 14, but I still stay true to my roots and
strive for a sound that is contemporary and dynamic, with plenty of movement
and creative jazz riffs. My music has been called, “a refreshing entry into the
jazz genre that will start to bring the younger generation into this style of
music.”</p>

<strong>Sock Tribe:</strong> Anyone who knows me well, knows that I am deeply committed to building community in my own neighborhood. One of the ways I do this is by walking the streets sporting bright colored whimsical socks, like, dinosaurs with golden unicorns, pink elephants, or bright polka-dots. I believe this brings positive energy to the streets and gives others permission to do the same. Now you can too!</li>

<strong>My Mug on a Mug:</strong> I am at a stage in life where I start every morning with a pot of french pressed coffee. A local artist and dear friend of mine, John Bell, volunteered to do a line drawing portrait of me. This will be screen printed upon a white porcelain mug which will allow us to break the proximity barriers of our linear dimension and commune together in a singular shared caffeine high. It might be the most expensive coffee mug you ever buy, but a very inexpensive joy ride into the Eternal Present. Namaste.</li>
<li>
<strong>Polly’s Patterns: </strong>My wife Polly has an extraordinary gift with art and design. In addition to being my own personal art director for everything associated with Rigel Thurston Band, she has also volunteered to create an “Out to Sea” pattern that will be used for thank you cards, socks, and whatever else needs a little love.

If I exceed my goal, the extra funds will go towards album expenses incurred prior to the campaign, additional CD duplication, and album promotion. Anything over that will go into my next project.</p><h2>The Impact</h2><p>I believe music transcends concepts, and heals things we didn’t even know needed healing. Music makes us better listeners. One of the ways I know how to bring positive change into the world is by making beautiful music. And with your help, I will do just that.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>One very real obstacle is that I am a stay-at-home dad with a toddler. All of my music projects have to fit around his schedule, which is mostly predictable. But there are times when it’s not, like when he gets sick, or doesn’t stay down for his nap. Being flexible in organizing my life is as much an art form as the music making itself.</p><p>Another aspect to this adventure is that I don’t have a fancy artist-development department molding me into a jewel of perfection. I stumble around in the dark banging into what works, and what doesn’t. It’s a process of trial and error that can be a bit time consuming. However, the benefit is I get to have complete control over my music and image. I plan on being transparent about all of this–my victories and my “learning experiences.”</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Share it with your friends! I need all the help I can get. If you have friends who would love my music, please invite them to join in.</p><p>If you’re not big on social media, you can always send good vibes my way, or a nice email: <a href=""mailto:rigelthurstonband@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20from%20Indiegogo!"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rigelthurstonband@gmail.com</a>. I need lots of encouragement!</p><p>I can only do this with your help.

Polly’s Patterns: My wife Polly has an extraordinary gift with art and design. In addition to being my own personal art director for everything associated with Rigel Thurston Band, she has also volunteered to create an “Out to Sea” pattern that will be used for thank you cards, socks, and whatever else needs a little love. You can check out more on her blog.

Original Artwork: For the last 10 years, I have been block printing my holiday greeting cards. I am offering original art to my contributors, which will also be used in the album cover.

Happy Birthday Video: I have a fun bluesy version of happy birthday that I would love to customize just for you!
 If I raise more or less than my goal.If I don’t hit my goal, I will do an EP and some single releases depending on the final numbers. If I exceed my goal, the extra funds will go towards album expenses incurred prior to the campaign, additional CD duplication, and album promotion. Anything over that will go into my next project.The ImpactI believe music transcends concepts, and heals things we didn’t even know needed healing. Music makes us better listeners. One of the ways I know how to bring positive change into the world is by making beautiful music. And with your help, I will do just that.ChallengesOne very real obstacle is that I am a stay-at-home dad with a toddler. All of my music projects have to fit around his schedule, which is mostly predictable. But there are times when it’s not, like when he gets sick, or doesn’t stay down for his nap. Being flexible in organizing my life is as much an art form as the music making itself.Another aspect to this adventure is that I don’t have a fancy artist-development department molding me into a jewel of perfection. I stumble around in the dark banging into what works, and what doesn’t. It’s a process of trial and error that can be a bit time consuming. However, the benefit is I get to have complete control over my music and image. I plan on being transparent about all of this–my victories and my “learning experiences.”Other Ways You Can HelpShare it with your friends! I need all the help I can get. If you have friends who would love my music, please invite them to join in.If you’re not big on social media, you can always send good vibes my way, or a nice email: rigelthurstonband@gmail.com. I need lots of encouragement!I can only do this with your help. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for supporting me.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</b></p><p><b>Pop Obscure brings you Records and Art!</b></p>
<p>Help support our shop in the Fashion District near the Historic Core in downtown Los Angeles
and we’ll hook you up with Tote Bags, T-Shirts, Stickers, Pins, Original Artwork,
and In-Store perks!</p><p><b>What is Pop Obscure?</b></p><p>A new independent record store in downtown Los Angeles! We carry new and used vinyl - (there's nothing like being surrounded by thousands of pieces of music and art).  We also have an art gallery where we feature single artists as well as curated group shows. Did I mention we have a small stage? Can't wait for those great drop-in jams! Secret shows? Fingers crossed!<br/></p><b>

Who is behind Pop Obscure?<br/><br/></b><p>
Hello Everyone. My name is Sherry Lee and
together with Dustin Lane, we've just opened Pop Obscure Records and Art
Gallery.  We are two creative people who
love - you guessed it - music and art! (and motorcycles too!)  Our passion from early on has always been a love for vinyl and music.  We both grew up as record store kids.  We found each other, started a band, got married and have been together ever since.  Dustin
has spent the last 2 decades in retail and entertainment production industries. Independently, he’s made a few <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/dustinobscure/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music videos, 2 movie shorts, a full length feature</a>
and has even written a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Jellyfish-Moon-Dustin-Lane-ebook/dp/B00K6MEJ2C?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=finding%20the%20jellyfish%20moon&amp;qid=1409341124&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book</a> and a few scripts.  I’m currently enjoying my 16<sup>th</sup>
year at Freestyle Photographic Supplies where I embrace my art-making side
with unique prints. As a freelancer, I have shown my work in various <a href=""http://www.freestylephoto.biz/freestyle-exposed-iv-unconventionally-traditional"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">galleries</a>, commercial print and continue to collect and create <a href=""http://www.sherryleephotography.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">images</a>. I am now
pulling double duty as we get back to our roots, become independent and create an opportunity for
our community to experience the fruits of our dreams and enjoy our favorite things right along with us.  </p><p><b>Location Location Location!</b></p><p>Downtown Los Angeles is enjoying a boom of new growth
and renovation. We’ve read that we are in the midst of some 90 projects just in
the downtown area alone. New buildings ranging from a new Federal Courthouse
and Wilshire Grand Tower (to be the tallest building on the West Coast) to
various hotels, retail spaces and over 5000 new housing units are all being
constructed in a very small area.</p><p>We
have been lucky enough to find a great space right in the middle of all of it.
We are a new independent record store in downtown and we are within easy
walking distance of The Ace Hotel, Orpheum Theater, Clifton’s Cafeteria and
Grand Central Market, to the galleries on Spring Street to the Regent Theater
and Nickel Diner on Main, to the Fashion District and Flower Mart. Did I
mention we are right next to a yummy Mexican restaurant and a parking lot?</p><p>
</p><p>Instead of heading to a coffee house where
everyone is plugged in and all alone; come visit us! We would like to offer you
a place to decompress. A place to enter a zen zone, while flipping through new
and used records; a place to enjoy art, good company and friendly conversation;
a place to meet new friends, and collect and build your life’s soundtrack; and,
if you’re a visual artist, we would like to offer you a chance to be seen, too.
We believe in supporting the arts and are looking forward to in-store events
and gallery openings to show off some of the best local talent in the world.</p><p>
</p><p>Look,
living in a big city can be overwhelming. We know first hand. But it can also
be amazing! Ultimately, we will offer an opportunity to escape the daily grind, if
only for a little while. You’ll find yourself in a place of discovery and inspiration.
And you’ll have a chance to score cool Record Store Day releases – That’s
right, because we’ll be ""the"" record store in “downtown”! We hope Pop Obscure
Records will be your place to collect or contribute something tangible. With
your support we can all be successful. </p><p>
</p><p>Remember – Music and Art make
everything better!</p>
<p><b>Why WE need YOU.</b></p>
<p>While we had hoped to bootstrap
our entire enterprise on our own, the project, and interest in it has grown. The
reality is we do need your help. It's time to fight for our dream.  We’ve cut costs as much as possible by
electing to design, build, and try to do everything ourselves. We gutted the
building, relied on the generosity of a few friends to help paint
and lay carpet and we've opened the doors to our welcoming neighborhood. But, some of the unexpected costs and setbacks have added up. We are behind and we
still need to continue to fill the bins and properly outfit the gallery. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why should you help?</b></p>Together we can make art happen!
When you support our project you are supporting the opportunity for creatives
and the collectors who both share a love of audible, visual and tangible art, to
come together in a single space. We hope that our perks are something cool you
would like to purchase. All physical items were designed by us and produced by
local artists and businesses. We believe in supporting our community and we
know you do too. All monies raised through this project will get our store off
the ground and into the community. Thank you for being a part of our team!<br/><p></p><p><b>Other ways You can Help.<br/></b></p>
If you can't contribute, we understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help. We are just 2 people, but with you behind us we can create an army of evangelists and angels. We need you to make some noise and get the word out on your social media accounts, emails and even when you are talking to people on your phone - don't forget to use the Indiegogo Share tools!  Every little bit helps and will get us closer to our goal.   If you will spread the word, we would be forever grateful.<br/><br/>
<p><b><u>Rewards and Cool Perks</u></b></p>

<br/></div>","Pop Obscure brings you Records and Art!
Help support our shop in the Fashion District near the Historic Core in downtown Los Angeles
and we’ll hook you up with Tote Bags, T-Shirts, Stickers, Pins, Original Artwork,
and In-Store perks!What is Pop Obscure?A new independent record store in downtown Los Angeles! We carry new and used vinyl - (there's nothing like being surrounded by thousands of pieces of music and art).  We also have an art gallery where we feature single artists as well as curated group shows. Did I mention we have a small stage? Can't wait for those great drop-in jams! Secret shows? Fingers crossed!

Who is behind Pop Obscure?
Hello Everyone. My name is Sherry Lee and
together with Dustin Lane, we've just opened Pop Obscure Records and Art
Gallery.  We are two creative people who
love - you guessed it - music and art! (and motorcycles too!)  Our passion from early on has always been a love for vinyl and music.  We both grew up as record store kids.  We found each other, started a band, got married and have been together ever since.  Dustin
has spent the last 2 decades in retail and entertainment production industries. Independently, he’s made a few music videos, 2 movie shorts, a full length feature
and has even written a book and a few scripts.  I’m currently enjoying my 16th
year at Freestyle Photographic Supplies where I embrace my art-making side
with unique prints. As a freelancer, I have shown my work in various galleries, commercial print and continue to collect and create images. I am now
pulling double duty as we get back to our roots, become independent and create an opportunity for
our community to experience the fruits of our dreams and enjoy our favorite things right along with us.  Location Location Location!Downtown Los Angeles is enjoying a boom of new growth
and renovation. We’ve read that we are in the midst of some 90 projects just in
the downtown area alone. New buildings ranging from a new Federal Courthouse
and Wilshire Grand Tower (to be the tallest building on the West Coast) to
various hotels, retail spaces and over 5000 new housing units are all being
constructed in a very small area.We
have been lucky enough to find a great space right in the middle of all of it.
We are a new independent record store in downtown and we are within easy
walking distance of The Ace Hotel, Orpheum Theater, Clifton’s Cafeteria and
Grand Central Market, to the galleries on Spring Street to the Regent Theater
and Nickel Diner on Main, to the Fashion District and Flower Mart. Did I
mention we are right next to a yummy Mexican restaurant and a parking lot?
Instead of heading to a coffee house where
everyone is plugged in and all alone; come visit us! We would like to offer you
a place to decompress. A place to enter a zen zone, while flipping through new
and used records; a place to enjoy art, good company and friendly conversation;
a place to meet new friends, and collect and build your life’s soundtrack; and,
if you’re a visual artist, we would like to offer you a chance to be seen, too.
We believe in supporting the arts and are looking forward to in-store events
and gallery openings to show off some of the best local talent in the world.
Look,
living in a big city can be overwhelming. We know first hand. But it can also
be amazing! Ultimately, we will offer an opportunity to escape the daily grind, if
only for a little while. You’ll find yourself in a place of discovery and inspiration.
And you’ll have a chance to score cool Record Store Day releases – That’s
right, because we’ll be ""the"" record store in “downtown”! We hope Pop Obscure
Records will be your place to collect or contribute something tangible. With
your support we can all be successful. 
Remember – Music and Art make
everything better!
Why WE need YOU.
While we had hoped to bootstrap
our entire enterprise on our own, the project, and interest in it has grown. The
reality is we do need your help. It's time to fight for our dream.  We’ve cut costs as much as possible by
electing to design, build, and try to do everything ourselves. We gutted the
building, relied on the generosity of a few friends to help paint
and lay carpet and we've opened the doors to our welcoming neighborhood. But, some of the unexpected costs and setbacks have added up. We are behind and we
still need to continue to fill the bins and properly outfit the gallery. 
Why should you help?Together we can make art happen!
When you support our project you are supporting the opportunity for creatives
and the collectors who both share a love of audible, visual and tangible art, to
come together in a single space. We hope that our perks are something cool you
would like to purchase. All physical items were designed by us and produced by
local artists and businesses. We believe in supporting our community and we
know you do too. All monies raised through this project will get our store off
the ground and into the community. Thank you for being a part of our team!Other ways You can Help.
If you can't contribute, we understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help. We are just 2 people, but with you behind us we can create an army of evangelists and angels. We need you to make some noise and get the word out on your social media accounts, emails and even when you are talking to people on your phone - don't forget to use the Indiegogo Share tools!  Every little bit helps and will get us closer to our goal.   If you will spread the word, we would be forever grateful.
Rewards and Cool Perks
In exchange for your support, we

art shown in a gallery. Contributing at any level will earn a permanent place

<p>I am a queer, multicultural, contemplative, cross-genre artist/songwriter who has been figuring things out musically since my first showcase of original and cover songs in 1993. I am from the Seattle area and currently live in Boulder, Colorado finishing a graduate degree at Naropa University in Somatic Counseling and Dance/Movement Therapy. Music-making and performing is an integral part of my life, a way to channel and to challenge what I know and want to know about myself, relationships, and the world. I headlined MainStage at Seattle Pride in 2003 with my single, ""Gay Marriage Song"" and released it as an acoustic piano/vocal on CD Baby in 2013. My newest album, <i>Home</i>, is my first studio recorded with collaborating musicians in jazz, folk, rock, and a cappella styles. Some people rate me as a ""balladeer."" I don't know what to call myself. But, I have valued connecting with fans who have over and over again come to see my shows, buy my music on and offline, and who have shared their stories, their hopes and dreams, a foundation for what my songs are about and how they come to be. <i>Home,</i> fills a unique space in music-making legacies. It is a part of a stream of performance artistry and songwriting in which generations of artists of which I am a part can find encouragement and support. You are a part of our artlovelegacies.</p>
<p>A little sample of my live work can be found at <a href=""http://youtube.com/brianottokimmel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtube.com/brianottokimmel</a>. You can also visit my website that I am in the process of updating to reflect the fuller brand of my work and the upcoming 2017 release of, <i>Home,</i> at <a href=""http://www.briankimmel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.briankimmel.com</a>.<br/></p>

The funds will go towards paying my recording engineer, Jake, for the work we do in the studio laying music tracks, editing, mixing, and mastering which altogether is around $2000, paying musicians around $300, and administrative costs like copyrights, CD production, and publishing, around $550, and the cost of running a campaign including sending perks $350.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every bit of the funds will go towards finishing the album in the studio. I have already contributed time and money to this project. If I reach the entire goal, the album will be completed in entirety and will help me pay and prevent me from going into debt. The completed album like my prior albums and to a greater degree will be a source of revenue and promotion for this and future projects. </span></li>
<li>Future campaigns may include raising support and funds for performances this spring and summer in the United States and abroad, and future production needs not covered by this campaign like production and release of singles and B-sides that will not be on <i>Home, </i>but were recorded during the project. I would also like to compile and publish manuscripts of the music from <i>Home </i>so that those who read music can play along and/or make covers of my songs, another possible source of revenue for me. A second and third campaign of $2300 - $3200 for these expenses may be up and coming. </li>
<li>Our agenda for the project is as follows: <span style=""background-color: initial;""><u>June 2016</u> finish laying tracks for album, <u>July 2016</u> Finish studio work with Jake through mixing and mastering, August 2016 perform and promote,  <u>September 2016</u> publish and send for manufacturing in time for Do It Yourself Musician's Conference in Chicago, <u>October 2016</u>, send gifts, November release pre-sale online at iTunes and CDBaby, <u>Jan - February 2017</u> performances, <u>March 2017</u> official release concert in Boulder, <u>Summer 2017</u> tentative tour performances in Europe.</span>

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<ul> <li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What fans often say is that whenever they hear my music, they feel happy. My music and performance helps their heart open, helps them touch feelings, love, warmth, memories that they have not been in touch with for a long time and did not know they have missed. Although I love being a musician and an artist, I believe my main work is as a listener. I listen to the stories that people share with me. I listen to prayers, dreams, hopes, desires of those in my life, and that's what I end up writing about. My songs are like prayers. They are ways to rekindle and to remember what matters most. And I believe that music-making is an art-form that transcends culture and yet speaks in culturally specific ways. But rhythm and song is a part of the earth, is part of every living being. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have been doing it myself and raising money for albums and performances for nearly twenty-five years. Fans have contributed to my music projects and travels by buying my music online and at shows, coming out to hear me play locally, booking house concerts and benefit performances, and some who have left me money in their wills and trusts.</span><br/>
</li> <li>Honestly, I have not ever done music alone, because fans have been with me every step of the way.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I am a queer, multicultural, contemplative, cross-genre artist/songwriter who has been figuring things out musically since my first showcase of original and cover songs in 1993. I am from the Seattle area and currently live in Boulder, Colorado finishing a graduate degree at Naropa University in Somatic Counseling and Dance/Movement Therapy. Music-making and performing is an integral part of my life, a way to channel and to challenge what I know and want to know about myself, relationships, and the world. I headlined MainStage at Seattle Pride in 2003 with my single, ""Gay Marriage Song"" and released it as an acoustic piano/vocal on CD Baby in 2013. My newest album, Home, is my first studio recorded with collaborating musicians in jazz, folk, rock, and a cappella styles. Some people rate me as a ""balladeer."" I don't know what to call myself. But, I have valued connecting with fans who have over and over again come to see my shows, buy my music on and offline, and who have shared their stories, their hopes and dreams, a foundation for what my songs are about and how they come to be. Home, fills a unique space in music-making legacies. It is a part of a stream of performance artistry and songwriting in which generations of artists of which I am a part can find encouragement and support. You are a part of our artlovelegacies.
A little sample of my live work can be found at http://youtube.com/brianottokimmel. You can also visit my website that I am in the process of updating to reflect the fuller brand of my work and the upcoming 2017 release of, Home, at http://www.briankimmel.com.

   What We Need  My goal of $3200 is the minimum I would need to finish my album in the studio. The funds will go towards paying my recording engineer, Jake, for the work we do in the studio laying music tracks, editing, mixing, and mastering which altogether is around $2000, paying musicians around $300, and administrative costs like copyrights, CD production, and publishing, around $550, and the cost of running a campaign including sending perks $350.
Every bit of the funds will go towards finishing the album in the studio. I have already contributed time and money to this project. If I reach the entire goal, the album will be completed in entirety and will help me pay and prevent me from going into debt. The completed album like my prior albums and to a greater degree will be a source of revenue and promotion for this and future projects. 
Future campaigns may include raising support and funds for performances this spring and summer in the United States and abroad, and future production needs not covered by this campaign like production and release of singles and B-sides that will not be on Home, but were recorded during the project. I would also like to compile and publish manuscripts of the music from Home so that those who read music can play along and/or make covers of my songs, another possible source of revenue for me. A second and third campaign of $2300 - $3200 for these expenses may be up and coming. 
Our agenda for the project is as follows: June 2016 finish laying tracks for album, July 2016 Finish studio work with Jake through mixing and mastering, August 2016 perform and promote,  September 2016 publish and send for manufacturing in time for Do It Yourself Musician's Conference in Chicago, October 2016, send gifts, November release pre-sale online at iTunes and CDBaby, Jan - February 2017 performances, March 2017 official release concert in Boulder, Summer 2017 tentative tour performances in Europe.
    

What You Will Get
This is my favorite part, what you will receive in time for Fall and Winter Holidays and Celebrations. A chance to share the beauty of our collective voices that helped craft and deliver these songs home. 

$5 Home Is Closer Than You Think - A download of my title track, ""Home Is Closer Than You Think.""

 $32 Home - A digital pre-sale album of Home with digital liner notes. $104 True Community Builder - A digital pre-sale album and two hard-copies of Home by mail with liner-notes. 

$257 Our Love's As Big As An Ocean - A digital pre-sale album and an option of a hard-copy album with signed liner notes, plus a bonus video of me singing a song I wrote just for you that you can share with everyone you know. 

$500 I'll Sing For You - Nothing says thank you more than a live concert with me singing favorites and covers from Home. Additional travel expenses may apply. Includes a digital copy of album and one autographed hard copy with autographed liner notes.


The Impact
 What fans often say is that whenever they hear my music, they feel happy. My music and performance helps their heart open, helps them touch feelings, love, warmth, memories that they have not been in touch with for a long time and did not know they have missed. Although I love being a musician and an artist, I believe my main work is as a listener. I listen to the stories that people share with me. I listen to prayers, dreams, hopes, desires of those in my life, and that's what I end up writing about. My songs are like prayers. They are ways to rekindle and to remember what matters most. And I believe that music-making is an art-form that transcends culture and yet speaks in culturally specific ways. But rhythm and song is a part of the earth, is part of every living being. 

I have been doing it myself and raising money for albums and performances for nearly twenty-five years. Fans have contributed to my music projects and travels by buying my music online and at shows, coming out to hear me play locally, booking house concerts and benefit performances, and some who have left me money in their wills and trusts.
 Honestly, I have not ever done music alone, because fans have been with me every step of the way. Every time I have written a song, it has been my fans in the front, middle, and back rows who have time and time again been there to experience the music first hand. I have a folder of letters I have received and an inbox full of messages from participant-audiences who have gifted me with their responses to my work, and the stories that brought them to my music, and what they remembered when they experienced it.    Risks & Challenges For me, the scariest challenge is not having faith enough in myself to continue this project to the end. Money means a lot, because it gets people in the space with me, turns on the power in the studio, and helps sign me up for distribution that will help get the music and my message out into the world, to people who may need it.

<h3>Small Kitchen Chaos Relocation Fund</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Small Kitchen Chaos, a folk(ish) duo currently getting ready to leave Vernon, BC. We are made up of Trista Bassett and John Fraser. We are also two people who are seriously in love.  We met through music, and formed our duo a year ago.  In addition to performing live, we recorded our debut album, Never Have a Doubt, in early August, live at Hunter Audio in Kelowna, BC.  </p>
<p>A couple of months ago, John found out that his mother has fallen quite ill.  He hasn't been home to Nova Scotia for several years, so we have decided to get rid of almost everything we own, pack up the instruments, camping gear and Sid the Cat, and head out on the road towards Halifax.  </p>
<p>We are shorter on funds than we were expecting, thanks to some necessary and very costly van repairs, so we are trying to raise additional funds for our trip through the sale of our album, a fairwell concert, and this campaign.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise a minimum of $1000 to offset some of the van repair costs.  This money will go directly towards our gas for the trip, food, camping costs and potentially (but hopefully not) additional van repairs if that situation were to arise. </p>
<p>We have a number of perks in mind, including a hand-written postcard from our journey, a personalized video of a song we have put your name in, Small Kitchen Chaos buttons, a signed (and hand-painted) copy of our album, and so much more!!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the funds we do collect will still go towards gas and travel expenses, but we really hope to reach our goal. </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
</div><div>
<p>We perform heartfelt songs the show our passion for traveling, the outdoors, and our love for each other.  We are so grateful to have found each other and to have so much in common, including this music we are now creating as a duo.  We are also fun! (Although I, Trista, tend to be more of the ""straight man"" to John's funny).  We have had such positive feedback about our performance and music together and we look forward to being able to share our personalities and music with you, our supporters! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well... We are heading across a very large country in our mini camper van.  Truth be told, any number of things could happen when traveling almost 6000km.   We are very lucky to have each other (and Sid the Cat).  We actually want to spend every minute together, so if we do get stranded in the middle of the country, we will still have each other, so that's basically all we need.  </p>
<p>That being said, we do hope we actually reach the other side in one piece, and hopefully with some funds to rent an apartment so we aren't camping in our tiny van in the early East Coast winter.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't financially able to support us at this time, you can still help us out by spreading the word about our campaign! Post the link on Facebook, tell people about what awesome humans we are (and Sid the Cat), tell them about the wonderful, fun and fantastic perks they will get by supporting us, and also, most importantly, that we are making this trip because we want to be closer to John's mother.  Your support, whether financial or word-of-mouth, is much appreciated.</p>

<h3>You may be asking yourself, “What is a ‘tasting concert?’""</h3>
<p>Did you know that the descriptions used by wine experts to describe wine parallel the terms that musicians use to describe the elements of a classical voice?</p>
<p><i>...clear, bright, round, smoky, opulent, bold, medium-bodied...</i></p>
<p>Matthew Burns, an internationally-acclaimed bass-baritone with a passion for wine, created <b>MAGNVM OPVS tasting concerts</b> to explore how perfectly the language of wine appreciation is set up to help audiences gain a deeper understanding of the classical voice - and vice versa!</p>
<p>At a <b>MAGNVM OPVS tasting concert</b>, audiences are guided through a traditional wine tasting process, an exploration which uses the senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch.

<p>Most people boil down their opinions of these art forms to one adjective - “sweet”, ""sharp"", “strident” - or, even more simply, to a black-and-white statement: “I don’t like it” or “I love it!” After an evening with our singers and experts, we hope our guests will have a more informed palate and the ability to discern and express what they hear and taste.</p>

<h3>Art Haus 2018 Season</h3>
<p>Last year we brought you Stravinsky's Rite of Spring beneath the Tree of Ténéré, the first ballet performance of its kind at Burning Man with a full orchestra amplified by Robot Heart. An audience of an estimated 10,000 Burners came out to witness the magic, proving a thirst for classical and ballet performances at Burning Man, and the experience was absolutely unforgettable.</p>

<p><i>video by Vincent Rommelaere </i></p>
<p>This year, we knew we had to come back with more mind-blowing performances, and in order to be able to perform when and where we pleased without relying too much on other groups, we knew we needed an art car! Our wish came true in February when we were presented with the opportunity to adopt a 1981 Hahn Pumper Fire Truck! We intend to build the fire truck into a mobile stage, complete with recognizable sails in the image of the Sydney Opera House! </p>
<p><i>We're turning this......</i></p>

<p><strong>Our 2018 Season</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by all the incredible art pieces brought to Burning Man we will be presenting a symphonic performance of Mussorgsky's <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i> in collaboration with The Baba Yaga House, the giant Step Forward puppets and Robot Heart as well as various other artists, to showcase and celebrate art in a much bigger way than Mussorgsky could have ever imagined. </p>
<p>Reflecting this year's <i>I, Robot</i> theme, we will present <i>We, Human</i>, a new ballet work by Robert Dekkers set to Steve Reich's <i>8 Lines. </i></p>
<p>Finally, at sunrise on Friday morning we will practice radical inclusion by inviting anyone with an instrument to join us in a performance of Terry Riley's masterpiece <i>In C, </i>which is written for any instrumentation and uses repeating figures and indeterminacy to create a massive, irreplicable musical experience. </p>

<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>All of our performers are gifting their time and talents to these projects, and we have a dedicated team of art car builders who are donating their time and hard work, but we still have a lot of expenses involved in bringing both the performances and the art car to the playa. </p>
<p>For our performances, we need to pay for rehearsal space, costumes, make up, marley, and various other equipment needs. We are fortunate to already have a lot of great equipment from our performance last year, so the vast majority of our funds will be going toward the art car, which will need a number of repairs in order to make it drivable, and will need funding in order to purchase the materials to build the stage and sails, as well as lighting and sound monitors. </p>
<p>If we do not make it to our fundraising goal, we will still repair the fire truck to use for equipment transportation, but we won’t be able to fully transform it yet. This may become a 2 year build process. If we exceed our goal, we will be able to make the fire truck even more spectacular, and hopefully have money for extra costs that come up along the way. </p>
<p>We are happy to offer a number of perks at varying donation levels! Please be sure to click the ""Get this perk"" button on the right hand side of this page under the perk you wish to claim. In addition to some awesome Art Haus Swag, we are offering several exciting Art Haus experiences.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are proud to be pioneers in the realm of putting the spectacle back into classical &amp; contemporary music and dance. With an incredibly successful Rite of Spring performance under our belt, we feel we've tapped into an exciting new style combining various artistic mediums. We believe that the work we create at Burning Man can also be brought home, which is why we're extremely excited to be building our mobile-stage art car. Once we create our mobile stage we plan to use it in the default world and well as on playa, so we can bring Art Haus pop-up performances to San Francisco and beyond! We feel there is no better way to promote classical music &amp; dance than to be able to physically bring our performances anywhere we want! We're thinking ballets at Golden Gate Park, symphonies at Dolores park, string quartets at Ocean Beach, and beyond! We are ready to obliterate the idea that classical performances are only for a certain age or class of audience, or that performances need to take place in a stuff concert hall. Are you with us?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our goals are ambitious and we know we face many challenges but our determination is making it happen, and every bit of help we are given goes a long way.</p>
<p>With limited rehearsal time together before we hit the playa, every note counts, so our dancers and musicians are dedicating their time at the end of August to putting together the entire production in a matter of days. We need to be able to rent rehearsal space for them to do their work!</p>
<p>As we did last year, we are facing an arid desert environment where dust storms and intense winds are common. Are we crazy? Hell yes. Our fearless musicians are dedicated to playing regardless of the weather, our dancers will dance through dust-storms. With the open playa as our theater our sound could easily get lost, so as we did last year we will be miking our orchestra and plugging into the Robot Heart sound bus for amplification. In order to do so, we need to add more sound equipment to accommodate a larger orchestra.</p>
<p>One reason classical music has been so underrepresented at Burning Man is that musicians are reluctant to bring their instruments to the dusty, windy desert environment. We are working to find appropriate used instruments for all our performers. If you are able to donate a used instrument, it will be much appreciated! </p>
<p>Last year we depended heavily on passing art cars to help us transport our large instruments (basses, timpani, percussion equipment) chairs and sound equipment, and were even left in the dust after the performance with our three large timpani and no way to get them home! Our musicians had to transport their own instruments and stands, but their determination made it happen. This year we will be able to transport our own equipment, on our own art car, and set up our own stage so our orchestra can focus on their job- playing amazing music really well! We are racing the clock to get our art car prepared in time for Burning Man but our dedicated team has already planned out work weekends to get it done! Every dollar helps us get there! </p>

</div></div>","Art Haus 2018 Season
Last year we brought you Stravinsky's Rite of Spring beneath the Tree of Ténéré, the first ballet performance of its kind at Burning Man with a full orchestra amplified by Robot Heart. An audience of an estimated 10,000 Burners came out to witness the magic, proving a thirst for classical and ballet performances at Burning Man, and the experience was absolutely unforgettable.

This year, we knew we had to come back with more mind-blowing performances, and in order to be able to perform when and where we pleased without relying too much on other groups, we knew we needed an art car! Our wish came true in February when we were presented with the opportunity to adopt a 1981 Hahn Pumper Fire Truck! We intend to build the fire truck into a mobile stage, complete with recognizable sails in the image of the Sydney Opera House! 
We're turning this......

Into this!

Our 2018 Season
Inspired by all the incredible art pieces brought to Burning Man we will be presenting a symphonic performance of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in collaboration with The Baba Yaga House, the giant Step Forward puppets and Robot Heart as well as various other artists, to showcase and celebrate art in a much bigger way than Mussorgsky could have ever imagined. 
Reflecting this year's I, Robot theme, we will present We, Human, a new ballet work by Robert Dekkers set to Steve Reich's 8 Lines. 
Finally, at sunrise on Friday morning we will practice radical inclusion by inviting anyone with an instrument to join us in a performance of Terry Riley's masterpiece In C, which is written for any instrumentation and uses repeating figures and indeterminacy to create a massive, irreplicable musical experience. 

 

What We Need and What You Get
All of our performers are gifting their time and talents to these projects, and we have a dedicated team of art car builders who are donating their time and hard work, but we still have a lot of expenses involved in bringing both the performances and the art car to the playa. 
For our performances, we need to pay for rehearsal space, costumes, make up, marley, and various other equipment needs. We are fortunate to already have a lot of great equipment from our performance last year, so the vast majority of our funds will be going toward the art car, which will need a number of repairs in order to make it drivable, and will need funding in order to purchase the materials to build the stage and sails, as well as lighting and sound monitors. 
If we do not make it to our fundraising goal, we will still repair the fire truck to use for equipment transportation, but we won’t be able to fully transform it yet. This may become a 2 year build process. If we exceed our goal, we will be able to make the fire truck even more spectacular, and hopefully have money for extra costs that come up along the way. 
We are happy to offer a number of perks at varying donation levels! Please be sure to click the ""Get this perk"" button on the right hand side of this page under the perk you wish to claim. In addition to some awesome Art Haus Swag, we are offering several exciting Art Haus experiences.

Each room is a whimsical storyboard for Gregangelo's Velocity Circus complete with installations, mosaics and a spiritual story. Click “get this perk” on the right to claim this perk!
For donations of $500 you are invited to come see our final dress rehearsal of Robert Dekkers new work We, Human on August 21 in San Francisco. This will be the only opportunity to see the work live if you are not going to Burning Man. Click “get this perk” on the right to claim this perk!

<p>You may know him from his work with Southampton freak-boppers The Mojo Co. You may know him such centuries as the 19th and his mad work on Bavarian castles. However you know him, new or familiar to you, this madman is bringing his first record to the world, and would love you to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Described by BBC 6 Music's Tom Robinson as having a ""foghorn voice [that] is joyfully at odds with his androgynous image"", Mad King Ludwig is an unmistakeable character with a mad story. His positive energy for a more colourful, mad and tolerant world is channelled into 9 eclectic songs which consider every side of that famous but often ignored phrase, 'Do What Makes You Happy'.</p>
<p>Recorded August-October 2018, partly on a houseboat in Southampton, UK, with producer Jake Wilmott, 'Do What Makes You Happy' showcases Mad King Ludwig's novel-esque songwriting ability and octopus-like musical talent - he sings, plays guitar, piano, saxophone, double bass and kitchen percussion on the album. A full band and special guests feature along the way, and pigeon-holing the album's style is both pointless and insensitive to pigeons.</p>
<p>Rewards for helping to support this album include a signed copy of the album and a ticket to the release show, at the Joiners, Southampton on Sat 26th January 2019 - both for a tenner, cheaper than both bought separately! Ludwig is collaborating with acclaimed photographer Brandon Otto to create a limited edition photo book cataloguing the choicest, maddest moments with the Mojo Co. and solo over the past few years.vHe is also working with artist Candy Joyce to offer you a unique piece of artwork that will be created in line with your own interpretation of the album!</p>

A full band and special guests feature along the way, and pigeon-holing the album's style is both pointless and insensitive to pigeons.
Rewards for helping to support this album include a signed copy of the album and a ticket to the release show, at the Joiners, Southampton on Sat 26th January 2019 - both for a tenner, cheaper than both bought separately! Ludwig is collaborating with acclaimed photographer Brandon Otto to create a limited edition photo book cataloguing the choicest, maddest moments with the Mojo Co. and solo over the past few years.vHe is also working with artist Candy Joyce to offer you a unique piece of artwork that will be created in line with your own interpretation of the album!

Mad King Ludwig is enormously proud of this record, and believes it is a worthy tonic to these turbulent times, indeed any time.

<p>This is PART 2 of our ongoing <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/costa-rican-composers-concert-album"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">campaign</a> to fund the production of an album of world premieres by Costa Rican composers who live abroad. We raised a total of $1530, with which we will pay for the recording (video and audio), but we need a little bit more to afford mixing and mastering the tracks, designing and editing the CD's artwork, printing the actual CDs, tickets to Costa Rica to supervise rehearsals, and other post-production expenses.</p>

<p>We are <strong>4 emerging Costa Rican composers</strong> based abroad who were chosen to write new original works for an upcoming July concert by the <strong>Orquesta Sinfónica de Heredia.</strong> Since it is rare in Costa Rica to have a concert showcasing the music of young composers, we want to take this opportunity to <strong>professionally film and record it </strong>– our goal is to encourage the current establishment of concert music in Costa Rica to entrust a new generation of composers with <strong>more opportunities</strong> to have our music performed.</p>
<p>We need your financial support  to cover<strong> expenses for video/audio recording,</strong> traveling to Costa Rica for the rehearsals, mixing &amp; mastering, album art design, and CD production, among other things. Usually these expenses are covered by state funds (the private sector's help in art is almost non-existent in Costa Rica), but shrinking budgets in times of economic austerity have made it difficult to find the financial assistance we need.</p>
<p>We agreed to write these works for free because we believe in the value that creating new art has in the shaping of culture. We are simply hoping to cover the expenses associated with producing a top-notch audiovisual recording and making it available for online streaming, as well as having a hard copy that we can share with our contacts. Scroll down to get to know who we are!</p>
<p><strong>Event Details</strong></p>
<p>Mostly comprised by young musicians, the <strong>Orquesta Sinfónica de Heredia</strong> is an orchestra that focuses on new and unexplored music from Latin America. Under the leadership of Latin Grammy winner composer and conductor <strong>Eddie Mora</strong>, it has risen to a prominent role in Costa Rican culture, performing works by Latin American composers and recording several albums during the last few years. For its fourth concert of the 2018 season, Eddie decided to yield the baton to a young Costa Rican conductor based in South Dakota, <strong>Luis A. Viquez</strong>, and let him premiere 4 new works by 4 emerging composers who live outside of Costa Rica: <strong>Pablo Chin </strong>(who lives in NYC), <strong>Jose Mora Jimenez</strong> (who lives in the Netherlands), <strong>Guido Sanchez</strong> (who lives in Illinois, USA) and <strong>Andrés Soto</strong> (who lives in New Jersey, USA)</p>
<p>Two concerts are scheduled:</p>
<p><strong>July 21st</strong>, Parroquia Inmaculada Concepción, Heredia, Costa Rica. (8pm)</p>
<p><strong>July 22nd,</strong> Eugene O'Neill Theater, San José, Costa Rica. (11am)</p>
<p><strong>Carlos ""Pipo"" Chaves</strong>, a Latin Grammy-winning sound engineer, has offered to record the concert for us for a reduced fee, so we are hoping to produce a first-rate audiovisual recording that shows a new generation of Costa Rican musicians coming into their own with the help of two established figures.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>We already raised $1530 in our first campaign! We are going to use those funds to pay for the live recording (both video and audio). Now we need a little bit more for the following expenses:</p>
<p>$<strong>500</strong> for additional mixing/mastering.</p>
<p>$<strong>600</strong> for CD-production expenses (printing, editing, streaming fees, etc)</p>
<p>$<strong>400</strong> for album cover artwork design*</p>
<p><strong>Total: $1500</strong></p>
<p>Optional: if we raise extra money, we will use an additional $<strong>1500</strong> for traveling expenses to Costa Rica for 2 composers, 2 weeks (Soto and Chin)</p>
<p><i>IndieGogo charges 5% of our crowdfunding total </i></p>
<p>*We want to commission a young Costa Rican artist (TBA) to design the cover art for our album. </p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, whatever we get will go towards recording and traveling expenses. Keep in mind IndieGogo charges 5% of our crowdfunding campaign!</p>
<p>Check the perks we offer!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>With your generous donation, you would be supporting the development of Costa Rica's next generation of composers and contributing towards having a stronger presence in the Latin American concert music scene. We plan to share this album around the world so we can inspire younger composers to continue to strive in their quest for obtaining commissions, while also hoping to encourage other institutions (both in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America) to support Hispanic composers by commissioning their music more often. Last year, the National Symphony of Costa Rica actually won a Latin Grammy for the first time with an album of works by Costa Rican composers from previous generations (which was, incidentally, produced by Eddie Mora and Carlos ""Pipo"" Chaves). With their help, we plan to submit this CD to try to compete in the same category next year.</p>

<p>Mahya Veray y su trauma es un colectivo musical creado por Mahya Veray sobrina del conocido compositor y maestro de musica puertorriqueño Amaury Veray, creador del Villancico Yaucano.</p>
<p> En este proyecto, Mahya de voz enigmática y seductora se une a diversos músicos internacionales  para hacer música al estilo ""AfroCaribbean"" / Fusión Caribeña/Afropop.</p>
<p> El resultado es un cóctel que contiene desde delicadas melodías hasta un afro pop sofisticado y actual que invita a bailar.</p>
<p>Para Mahya, el golpe en el tambor, es la conexión con el alma.</p>
<p>Mahya través de sus melodías nos cuentan su irreverencia y sentido del humor en tiempos de trauma algo que hacia mucho Celia Cruz y La Lupe para la época de la Fania.Su raíz multicultural hace de su estilo uno sabroso para el deleite de sus seguidores.</p>
<p>Mahya posee un registro de voz único e impecable pero su manera de cantar conecta con el espíritu  sus dotes de tarima logran cautivarte y transpórtate a épocas,  donde la voz, sudar y el feeling eran primordiales.</p>
<p>Su concepto musical el Trauma son músicos especializados en el jazz y en este disco han tocado un batallón de artistas de la nueva escuela del afrocaribeña. Ellos, con su talento logran una sonoridad y versatilidad única.  Mahya Veray y su Trauma es ese ADN que nos caracteriza como antillanos esa mescolanza de sabores, ritmos, colores, que nos hace tan distintivos.</p>
<p>Mahya Veray representa una música del nuevo caribe, el de los que sueña con alas en los pies. Esto lo escribió un crítico de música en Cuba para una revista americana. </p>
<p>Su raíz multicultural hacen de su estilo uno único y sabroso para el deleite de sus seguidores.</p>
<p>La Sade antillana con el vozarrón de la Adele pero en castellano le dicen en los suburbios de Santurce su ciudad natal en PR.</p>
<p>El golpe en el tambor es la conexión con las Antillas y sus raíces africanas,  eso es lo que veremos  como protagonista en este disco. Sabrosura Caribeña!. Contamos con 9 temas como Bagua, Pepita de Grosella, Ombligo a Destiempo, Lamento, Barrio, Energía Sutil, Tu me gustas mucho, La Nana del gato hasta su tan divertida canción Carmen, la Cachapera nos llevan a través de sus melodías, irreverentes con un  sentido del humor realista pero mágico. A sanar en tiempos de trauma. Todos los temas son autoría de Mahya Veray y en algunos temas colaboró con el cantautor cubano Xino Carrasco, el pianista puertorriqueño Eduardo Zayas y el  productor uruguayo Gonzalo López. </p>
<p>Han colaborado músicos de la escuela de la bomba, de la plena, del rock funk, del flamenco, jazz, de salsa y de la rumba española creando un sonido bien mágico y único que sin duda Mahya Veray denomina Afroantillano.Sabrosura para los mulatos y cosa buena es el sentir de los Traumáticos.</p>
<p>Mahya Veray is a Puerto Rican artist, singer that marks in her tones and melodies the caribbean beat composed by the tropical magic that characterizes the island.

</div></div>","Mahya Veray y su trauma es un colectivo musical creado por Mahya Veray sobrina del conocido compositor y maestro de musica puertorriqueño Amaury Veray, creador del Villancico Yaucano.
 En este proyecto, Mahya de voz enigmática y seductora se une a diversos músicos internacionales  para hacer música al estilo ""AfroCaribbean"" / Fusión Caribeña/Afropop.
 El resultado es un cóctel que contiene desde delicadas melodías hasta un afro pop sofisticado y actual que invita a bailar.
Para Mahya, el golpe en el tambor, es la conexión con el alma.
Mahya través de sus melodías nos cuentan su irreverencia y sentido del humor en tiempos de trauma algo que hacia mucho Celia Cruz y La Lupe para la época de la Fania.Su raíz multicultural hace de su estilo uno sabroso para el deleite de sus seguidores.
Mahya posee un registro de voz único e impecable pero su manera de cantar conecta con el espíritu  sus dotes de tarima logran cautivarte y transpórtate a épocas,  donde la voz, sudar y el feeling eran primordiales.
Su concepto musical el Trauma son músicos especializados en el jazz y en este disco han tocado un batallón de artistas de la nueva escuela del afrocaribeña. Ellos, con su talento logran una sonoridad y versatilidad única.  Mahya Veray y su Trauma es ese ADN que nos caracteriza como antillanos esa mescolanza de sabores, ritmos, colores, que nos hace tan distintivos.
Mahya Veray representa una música del nuevo caribe, el de los que sueña con alas en los pies. Esto lo escribió un crítico de música en Cuba para una revista americana. 
Su raíz multicultural hacen de su estilo uno único y sabroso para el deleite de sus seguidores.
La Sade antillana con el vozarrón de la Adele pero en castellano le dicen en los suburbios de Santurce su ciudad natal en PR.
El golpe en el tambor es la conexión con las Antillas y sus raíces africanas,  eso es lo que veremos  como protagonista en este disco. Sabrosura Caribeña!. Contamos con 9 temas como Bagua, Pepita de Grosella, Ombligo a Destiempo, Lamento, Barrio, Energía Sutil, Tu me gustas mucho, La Nana del gato hasta su tan divertida canción Carmen, la Cachapera nos llevan a través de sus melodías, irreverentes con un  sentido del humor realista pero mágico. A sanar en tiempos de trauma. Todos los temas son autoría de Mahya Veray y en algunos temas colaboró con el cantautor cubano Xino Carrasco, el pianista puertorriqueño Eduardo Zayas y el  productor uruguayo Gonzalo López. 
Han colaborado músicos de la escuela de la bomba, de la plena, del rock funk, del flamenco, jazz, de salsa y de la rumba española creando un sonido bien mágico y único que sin duda Mahya Veray denomina Afroantillano.Sabrosura para los mulatos y cosa buena es el sentir de los Traumáticos.

<p>Porch Stomp was conceived in the spring of 2014 when Nicholas Horner, a charismatic, straw-haired singer from the wilds of Central Pennsylvania began working with Make Music New York (MMNY) to produce their annual celebration of outdoor music all around New York City on the summer solstice.  Brought on as a fellow, Horner was suggested to create and promote a special project with the goal of connecting to the NYC folk community.</p>
<p>As classically trained vocalist, this feat would surely be somewhat of a stretch- he threw himself into the folk music world, frequenting bluegrass and old time jams, open mics and folk music concerts all around the city.  It was at Sheriff Bob’s “Good Times” jam, one of the longest-standing jams in NYC, that he met Theo Boguszewski, a dancer and music-appreciator who was learning to play fiddle.</p>
<p>Nick enlisted Theo’s help to recruit musicians to take part in the festival. The first annual Porch Stomp took place on a beautifully sunny Saturday, and was viewed by many as a great success. Musicians, dancers and music-lovers travelled from across the city to Governors Island for the free, participatory celebration of the summer solstice and american folk music. The stately old officers’ houses in Nolan Park felt more like a neighborhood than a festival venue, and folks walked away feeling more connected to each other and to some of the musical traditions that have shaped our country.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, Theo and Nick have continued to grow the festival by partnering with committed, relevant community organizations such as the City Stompers, Brooklyn Bluegrass Collective, Brookladelphia, Cowgirl Seahorse, and community leaders such as Hilary Hawke and David Harvey, among many, many others.</p>
<p>Porch Stomp has also grown to have a national reputation amongst artists and music lovers alike  (In fact, Theo and Nick literally drove cross-country in the summer of 2016 to spread the good word)! Last year, Porch Stomp 2017 boasted over 70 performers on 10 “stages” (or porches) in spite of torrential rain, serving as yet another testament to the one-of-a-kind experience that the Porch Stomp provides each year!</p>
<p>Philosophically speaking, Porch Stomp focuses on inclusivity rather than hierarchy. There are no stars performers or headlining slots, but rather a space where musicians and music lovers of every age, background and ability level are invited to share and engage ( a mission closely aligning with both MMNY and their predecessor, the French Festival “Fete de la Musique”). Porch Stomp is the place where artists get to share their music with folk communities around NYC and beyond, and make connections that will sustain them throughout their musical career.</p>
<p>We’ve been amazed and humbled by how this festival has grown over the past five years!  In the tradition of folk music expression, we will continue to carry the torch of inclusive celebration while looking back upon our shared musical heritage as a framework for moving forward.  </p>
<p>In the past, the Porch Stomp team has produced the festival on a budget of less than $1500 (often from contributions made by fellow artists and festival goers), money which has been immediately funneled back into the Porch Stomp community by way of marketing and outreach costs, micro-stipends for curators that have to hire house bands, and upkeep fees such as website hosting and other incurred expenses.  Furthermore, Porch Stomp is entirely volunteer run- Nick, Theo and an incredible team of staff all give their time and energy because they believe in the mission of Porch Stomp. However, as our community continues to grow, so does our need for financial support! Besides--- we got to wondering what a little more money could really do...</p>
<p>Well, here’s what we figured out:</p>
<p>We could invite even more curators to Porch Stomp, meaning more artists! We could offer amenities like free food and free beer for performers! We could market the festival city-wide, and produce mini concerts leading up to the festival to increase exposure and make sure our artists get seen by the most festival-goers possible! We could create really cool Porch Stomp swag and giveaways! We could have every folk community that is important to anyone in New York City represented at our festival! We could spread so much joy and love through music and dance that just maybe, for 5 sweet hours on Governors Island, we would all forget about the long winters, broken down subways, unusual smells, high rent, leaky pipes… you get the idea!</p>
<p>As corny as it all sounds, Porch Stomp allows us to cultivate something tangible and incredibly important in New York City: community.  We believe that strong communities have a real impact on peoples’ lives. Community has the power to bring us peace and sense of mind in what can be an otherwise uninviting and isolating city.  In supporting Porch Stomp, you are supporting a dance and music tradition that brings people together! Please donate to our campaign, and we can’t wait to see you this year on June 24th!</p>

I did not enter the studio wondering what sound I would achieve and arrive at an end result.  I entered the studio with a hazy vision I could only imagine being clear and committed myself towards bringing that vision into focus.  <br/><br/>I was fortunate to have an amazing engineer and co-conspirator with me on this project, and Tod Levine and Magnetic North Studios have been instrumental in bringing this album to life.  </p><p>The other side of this story is that I live in a small mountain town called Saugerties, NY, and every bit of inspiration needed to complete this project was taken from the Catskill Mountains that surround it.  This little town and the greater Hudson Valley has been so supportive of independent music that you can't help but want to give back in any way you can.  <br/><br/>That's why I've decided to hold the release show for Mountain Time in Saugerties, right in the heart of the village.  The place where all the local shows used to happen was in a little place called ""Dave's Coffee Shop"", and folks in town still talk about how awesome that place was for live music.  The truth is that Saugerties just hasn't had the same vibe without that place serving as a venue.  <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521012553/cxvrwihqlxvbznnkrq1i.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522886405/uyipfzk8yiakcyrnxwni.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Saugerties and the area around Woodstock, NY (Ulster County) has a wealth of talent in the form of musicians, artists, sculptors, and that talent itself serves as a continual source of inspiration for myself and other artists.  My hopes are that the release party for Mountian Time is successful enough to encourage the owners of Love Bites (formerly Dave's) to host live music on an ongoing basis.  I have no doubt that Love Bites will benefit from regular shows and I have no doubt that the village of Saugerties will be there to support Love Bites with their future events.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>With this release party, I'll be showcasing two other local Folk &amp; Americana groups whose music I thoroughly enjoy.  If you haven't seen Hallow Dog or The Mead Mountain Resonators, I have no doubt you'll enjoy their sound as much as I do.  The release party on May 19th is going to be a Roots music event that will keep the village of Saugerties buzzing for days and weeks to come.  </p><p> </p><p><br/>So now that I've told you all there is to know about Mountain Time and the album release party, I should tell you about the marketing efforts I've committed towards this project.  These days, it’s a video-centric world out there and as a musician, it’s become increasingly difficult to spread your content online without the power of video.  Given that I did not have the financial resources to hire a cinematographer, I self-produced the campaign video and two lyric videos I’ll be releasing before the close of this campaign.  This has been a blessing in disguise as in the process of producing these videos, I’ve pretty much learned Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects and now I can bring you videos in the future. </p><p>All of my merchandise and my first two album copies are printed and packaged by small businesses local to Saugerties, NY (Turning Mill).  </p><p>By pledging to this preorder campaign, you are supporting all the following:</p><ul>

<li>The local music scene in Saugerties, NY</li>

I did not enter the studio wondering what sound I would achieve and arrive at an end result.  I entered the studio with a hazy vision I could only imagine being clear and committed myself towards bringing that vision into focus.  I was fortunate to have an amazing engineer and co-conspirator with me on this project, and Tod Levine and Magnetic North Studios have been instrumental in bringing this album to life.  The other side of this story is that I live in a small mountain town called Saugerties, NY, and every bit of inspiration needed to complete this project was taken from the Catskill Mountains that surround it.  This little town and the greater Hudson Valley has been so supportive of independent music that you can't help but want to give back in any way you can.  That's why I've decided to hold the release show for Mountain Time in Saugerties, right in the heart of the village.  The place where all the local shows used to happen was in a little place called ""Dave's Coffee Shop"", and folks in town still talk about how awesome that place was for live music.  The truth is that Saugerties just hasn't had the same vibe without that place serving as a venue.  Saugerties and the area around Woodstock, NY (Ulster County) has a wealth of talent in the form of musicians, artists, sculptors, and that talent itself serves as a continual source of inspiration for myself and other artists.  My hopes are that the release party for Mountian Time is successful enough to encourage the owners of Love Bites (formerly Dave's) to host live music on an ongoing basis.  I have no doubt that Love Bites will benefit from regular shows and I have no doubt that the village of Saugerties will be there to support Love Bites with their future events.With this release party, I'll be showcasing two other local Folk & Americana groups whose music I thoroughly enjoy.  If you haven't seen Hallow Dog or The Mead Mountain Resonators, I have no doubt you'll enjoy their sound as much as I do.  The release party on May 19th is going to be a Roots music event that will keep the village of Saugerties buzzing for days and weeks to come.   So now that I've told you all there is to know about Mountain Time and the album release party, I should tell you about the marketing efforts I've committed towards this project.  These days, it’s a video-centric world out there and as a musician, it’s become increasingly difficult to spread your content online without the power of video.  Given that I did not have the financial resources to hire a cinematographer, I self-produced the campaign video and two lyric videos I’ll be releasing before the close of this campaign.  This has been a blessing in disguise as in the process of producing these videos, I’ve pretty much learned Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects and now I can bring you videos in the future. All of my merchandise and my first two album copies are printed and packaged by small businesses local to Saugerties, NY (Turning Mill).  By pledging to this preorder campaign, you are supporting all the following:
Local business in Saugerties, NY (Magnetic North Studios, Turning Mill, Love Bites)

The next album

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Flavio Silva, and I am a Brazilian guitarist and composer based in New York. I've had the opportunity to live and work in a few different countries during the past 9 years, including Belgium, the Netherlands and most recently, NYC. </p>
<p>These years abroad gave me a lot of great experiences such as playing several festivals in Europe, such as the North Sea Jazz Festival, Delft Jazz fest, Gronau Jazz Festival, Langnau Jazz nights, Koektebell Jazz party, among others.</p>
<p>Since leaving Brazil in 2009, I learned a lot and my music transformed into something very personal and with a very clear goal: To be able to communicate with the public through instrumental music. With that in mind I want to present to you my newest project, entitled Break Free.</p>
<p>This project is my call for joy, hope, love and justice through music, and consists of 7 authorial songs and one cover by the Brazilian composer Chico Buarque. I had the privilege of working with some of my best friends and amazing musicians in the New York scene, including Curtis Nowosad on Drums, Alex Apolo Ayala on Bass, James Francies on Piano and Rhodes, Michael Mayo on Vocals and the great Seamus Blake on Saxophone.</p>
<p>This project is almost finished and I'm launching this Indiegogo campaign in order to complete it.</p>
<p>The main idea of Break Free is to connect the music and musicians with the public in a different way. Jazz and instrumental music can be often very complex and hard to follow by the listener, creating a gap between the listener and the music.  As I normally say, my main goal was to have my mother (who is not a musician) to feel good, enjoy, clap or tap her foot while listening to Break Free, so, I found a way to write music that has a strong musical content and can still be enjoyed by both musicians and people with no musical background. With your help, I will be able to bring this record alive and connect with more people than you can ever imagine!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to finish this project, I need $5000.</p>
<p>This amount will be divided into the following aspects:</p>
<p>-Mastering the album in May 2018</p>
<p>-Cover Design</p>
<p>-Marketing/PR</p>
<p>-Printing of physical CD's</p>
<p>-Distribution of the album</p>
<p>I prepared a few rewards for the backers. As usual, the more you help me, the better your reward will be!</p>
<p>We will have digital downloads, signed physical copies of Break Free, signed charts of one of the songs in the album, Skype/private lessons, an unreleased bonus track(not included in the record), a solo guitar house concert and a full band house concert.</p>
<p>You can find the actual amounts right next to this text!</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I don't achieve the total amount?</strong></p>
<p>In case the entire amount is not achieved, I will focus on the finishing the audio part of the record, the cover design and the printing part, those are the priorities in order to complete this project.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>I completely understand that sometimes it is hard to help fund this type of vision/project, so, even if you can't help me financially, you can still help me by sharing the link to this project and tell your friends about it. That will be of great value as well.</p>
<p>I wish you the best for reading this project and if you feel like it, help me make Break Free a reality!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Daryl Boyer. I am a Christian singer/songwriter and recording artist with a heart to deliver music to people that is inspiring and filled with hope to navigate life and the struggles we all face each and every day. As an independent recording artist, it is very difficult to manage and take on the huge cost involved to produce and record a major album release that will make it out onto the airwaves and TV where the songs can impact the listener on a daily basis. Daryl Boyer Ministries was founded in 2015 with the sole purpose of getting music and the hope of a life in Jesus out to the world with whatever tools and resources we could assemble. Music is a powerful tool that cuts straight to the soul and core of us all as people. It can often reach out to us when other avenues can not. Since our minds are so receptive to song, it is often one of the best places we are influenced to receive a message of help, hope, and truth. In addition to working hard daily to provide for my family as a carpenter and part-time Worship Leader, I have dedicated my life's spare time to reaching the broken hearted, hopeless, oppressed, and afflicted. The opportunity to have access to a person's heart and mind for a few moments through song can be a powerful opportunity to make a lasting difference for so many.</li>
<li>So the question comes... What are we able to accomplish by releasing a high quality music release? In short we achieve much greater access and success to minister to the needs of people when it is done right and done well. Fact is, we all know presentation and quality is important so that people will take interest in what is put in front of them by ensuring it sounds good and carries a strong relatable message. Second, ministry requires investment. It is crucial to be able to afford paying for the platform from which we are able to deliver the message/songs so that people can hear it worldwide with a wide range of access to it. The cost of marketing and getting the songs firmly established with radio and media is not without significant cost. We have worked hard to establish a path to be connected in the music industry for getting it out there on radio, tv, and into stores. Having these connections is awesome, but these connections also require the funds to make it happen. Let me just be clear that this campaign is not a money making opportunity for us directly. All funds go directly to the cost of this ministry. We are interested in reaching people with a message of hope they can connect with and have full access to. This music ministry is a labor of love, one that exists to be a blessing to others. We truly need your help and contributions to help us make this happen. There are many hurting and searching people all around us that need the message found within the music we are bringing to the world.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A few months back we raised the funds to cover the recording and release of the first single ""Never Looking Back"" for this new album using the platform Go Fund Me. The song went out to the world just as planned with great success and blessing on it. That first song currently sits at a #3 position in Christian music charts. By having our ministries music positioned well within the charts of the industry, it truly enables our current and future songs to be heard over and over by many across the world. What a wonderful opportunity to help in making a difference. We are thankful for those who helped in getting the ball rolling as the doors of opportunity opened for us to build momentum and establish a platform for ministry to happen on a large scale. We have prayed and worked hard in writing these new songs for this album. We are doing all we can to ensure the rest of the album will be just as powerful to make an impact. As you know getting most anything of value accomplished in life requires both money and hard work. Along with your prayers, what we really need are people with a heart to help us deliver our message and further open the door. By contributing financially, you assist us in raising the funds needed for this album release, thus furthering the work of the ministry. In addition to the album release, our hope and future goal is to get out on the road this year more as a ministry. In time as God enables this to happen more, we will be able to connect more deeply on a personal level using the music as an entry point for sharing more detail about the songs and what is behind them. This will give us opportunity to share further about the hope everyone can have as they navigate through what can be a very trying life with often very broken circumstances. Our music ministry philosophy is to reach people where they are at in life, right in the midst of the struggles they face. We want to honor Jesus Christ as we share His grace and love for each person we can connect with. For us and our ministry, there is nothing that holds greater value above seeing people restored and changed for the better. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing people set free from the things that have held them back and held them down. It is powerful and exciting to see Jesus move in their lives.</p>
<p>Supporting this project is an opportunity for you to invest in the music of our ministry, but most importantly you get a chance to help others as they find victory over the struggles they face each day. This is ultimately an investment into people's lives, that is priceless. Would you partner with us financially as we make this album and step out this year to accomplish reaching out to people all around the globe?</p>
<ul>
<li>What we need to raise financially to make the album a success in both production and release to the radio/television is $15,000. This will be the base amount needed as a minimum to accomplish getting the job done professionally while making an impact and being at the level of quality required. These funds will pay the studio, producer, musicians, physical production, promotion &amp; marketing, and all people required to get the job done. Again, there is no money in this for me, these funds will simply cover the cost.  We will trust the Lord for providing any additional funding that we may need as we step out to get out on the road to share in greater detail as the year moves forward for ministry.</li>

</li>
<li>As a way of saying thank you for your contribution we would like to give you something in return for your support. We will be setting up a rewards package for each one that contributes. We will be awarding gifts bundled together that will include things like free music CD's, an early digital download of the new album, social media perks and shoutouts, various clothing, personal time spent with the artist, Your name in the cd credits, and a free concerts to the higher giving tiers. (More details on this in the perks section)</li>
<li>We are believing in faith that we will fully fund our needed financial goal to be in full production by mid January 2018. As soon as the funds are raised we intend to begin in full swing.</li>

23) Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are San Francisco based rockers Alvie &amp; The Breakfast Pigs! Our band has come a long way since we started three years ago in Tempe Arizona, but we have even greater distances to travel... and hopefully that distance will be traveled in our own tour van! To make this happen we need your HELP! 2017 brought us all over the western half of the United States to places like Austin and Denver; however, renting a van for each trip has become increasingly unsustainable for our budget. To continue this journey we need our own van. Each band member will be contributing a big portion of the total cost of the van, but being in a band is an expensive habit. We need your help to cover all the costs that come with owning including insurance, registration, and having a little money in the bank should we need to repair our new baby. We can't make this happen without your support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3500 to reach our goal. All of the funding will go to the purchase of this van first and foremost. </p>
<p>We have some AWESOME perks that we want YOU to have for donating to us, including Limited edition tapes, CD's, Lathe Records of our music, custom prizes from tour, Etc. Check out the perks to the right of the page for a more complete list----&gt;</p>
<p>We will be posting updates with some sweet photos of the custom artwork, and shirts, so make sure to keep checking this page!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating to our campaign you will be helping us spread our music to a greater audience, as well as helping us get a van, where we hope to gain some momentum as a band. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We don't require a donation, we understand that times are tough. <br/>If you are unable to donate but would still like to contribute, please share our campaign with others!</p>

<h3>EVOLUTION REVOLUTIONARIES</h3>
<p>We're Freerunner, a band formed in Austin, Texas with the goal of inspiring others through music. We've just finished tracking our newest record ""Evolution Revolutionaries"" in Nashville, TN, but we need a little help finishing it!</p>
<ul>
<li>""Evolution Revolutionaries"" is a concept about becoming the change you want to see. It's up to You to make the difference, and you're an Evolution Revolutionary just as much as anyone else. Because of this, <strong>All CD copies will be manufactured with 100% recycled materials.</strong> We hope this record will inspire you to get out there and create change!</li>
<li>""Evolution Revolutionaries"" is the third record from songwriting team Todd Siff &amp; Matt Live. Their collective goal is to create personal, heartfelt songs that inspire positivity and togetherness.</li>
<li>""Evolution Revolutionaries"" was recorded at Cousin Bob's Studio in Nashville, TN with engineer Cameron Davidson. Cousin Bob's is a state of the art recording facility with an amazing instrument collection. Check out the studio for yourself by clicking <a href=""http://www.cousinbobmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>.<br/> </li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/> </h3>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for $7000, as the services to create this album are not the most affordable. Mixing will cost us around $3500, $500 for Mastering (making it sound polished), $2500 for physical copies, and $500 for stickers &amp; shirts and other physical merchandise to go along with the album.</li>
<li>We have some fun Perks for you! First off, we'll be releasing the first single ""Come Alive"" in the next two months, and every donation of $5 or more will get you a digital download of it as soon as it comes out. From there, the perks get better! Ranging from physical copies of the album, to meals with the band...you can even buy Matt's guitar! Browse through and see all the fun stuff we have in store for you.</li>
<li>We know we say ""Kickstarter"" in our video, but one benefit of Indiegogo is that if we don't make our goal, we still get to keep our funding. We'll use what we get to work on what we can, but it will take months and months longer for us to finish if we have to fund it all by ourselves.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What difference will your contribution make?</p>
<ul>
<li>We practice what we preach, and are Evolution Revolutionaries ourselves. In 2017 alone, Freerunner donated to five registered organizations including OXFAM and the ACLU. We can't wait to see what exciting charities we can help in 2018 as well!</li>
<li>Being real here, <i>Freerunner isn't a hobby for us</i>. We want this to be our career. We want to play music professionally for the rest of our lives, tour the world, and play stadiums, and with our hard work and persistance, we know we will. Supporting us here helps us support that dream and make it attainable for us!<br/> </li>

<h3>Thanks for Your Interest</h3>
<p>A lot of artists are using crowdfunding for their CD projects these days, some far more established than me. The fact is, most indie CDs never even recover the investment but if you want to be taken seriously as an artist you have to keep putting out new music.</p>
<p>I had a great experience in crowdfunding when I broke the headstock off my beloved old Epiphone guitar a couple of years ago and it was suggested that I make an appeal through IndieGogo to get it repaired (it was an expensive repair and I couldn't afford it myself).  Anyway, I made my appeal, I raised $1200, the guitar was repaired and I am soooo grateful to have my baby back and she will be prominently featured on the new recording. </p>
<p>I wondered aloud back then if these folks would have been so quick to donate to a new Brian Blain recording as they were to rescue a damaged instrument...Well, we'll find out now. With so much music coming out these days, I can only hope this old blues guy should get your support versus all those eager, hard-working young artists whose career is mostly ahead of them,</p>
<p>But I do have supporters, and I see them in the audience with a big smile on their face so I'm encouraged to keep putting my music out there. I haven't been gigging very much,  and maybe my touring days are winding down (I've got a song about that, too), but the creative juices are still flowing and as long as there are folks out there who want to hear my music, I will keep putting it out.</p>
<p>If you prefer to contribute without going through IndieGogo, send your donation to Brian Blain, 326 Woodfield Road, Toronto, ON  M4L 2X1   or e-transfer brianblain@brianblain.ca (and a big thank you to my first direct donor, Alice Brock of Provincetown, Mass)</p>

<h3><strong>Why I need your support</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>  Welcome to our <i>phase two </i>fundraiser for my tribute CD to jazz singing legend Mark Murphy. I'm turning to you again hoping to raise funds for final vocals, mixing, and marketing. The generous donations from my original crowd funder were enough to record but not enough to do post-production. Nevertheless, I took the ""build it and they’ll come"" attitude. The cd tracks are now recorded.  We are very, very happy with the outcome. I can't wait for you hear it!  You can kinda catch a ""feel"" by watching the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmcco6Weepw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">video</a> taped by Tom Emmi in the studio as we recorded ""Nightmood”.</p>
<p>As a young jazz singer, I was blessed to be supported by a well-run indie label that helped build my career and established my presence on the national and international jazz scene. Over the ensuing decades, I’ve seen the music industry mutate. Today the challenges of the digital age can put tremendous stress on the recording artist, but it has also brought new opportunities, such as crowdfunding. Although no longer a source of significant income, even for many established popular artists, the need for releasing new recordings is still essential for staying alive in the business. It’s important to document one’s artistry, and it’s a hook for getting booked and staying in the game. It heightens awareness, it generates work, and emotionally speaking, making recordings is what keeps artists alive, this ability to share their art of spontaneous creation and love.</p>

  Welcome to our phase two fundraiser for my tribute CD to jazz singing legend Mark Murphy. I'm turning to you again hoping to raise funds for final vocals, mixing, and marketing. The generous donations from my original crowd funder were enough to record but not enough to do post-production. Nevertheless, I took the ""build it and they’ll come"" attitude. The cd tracks are now recorded.  We are very, very happy with the outcome. I can't wait for you hear it!  You can kinda catch a ""feel"" by watching the video taped by Tom Emmi in the studio as we recorded ""Nightmood”.
As a young jazz singer, I was blessed to be supported by a well-run indie label that helped build my career and established my presence on the national and international jazz scene. Over the ensuing decades, I’ve seen the music industry mutate. Today the challenges of the digital age can put tremendous stress on the recording artist, but it has also brought new opportunities, such as crowdfunding. Although no longer a source of significant income, even for many established popular artists, the need for releasing new recordings is still essential for staying alive in the business. It’s important to document one’s artistry, and it’s a hook for getting booked and staying in the game. It heightens awareness, it generates work, and emotionally speaking, making recordings is what keeps artists alive, this ability to share their art of spontaneous creation and love.

Dear Friends,
In the past few years I have teamed up with an international booking agent, Jean-Pierre Leduc http://www.lunchedrecords.com/. We met just after my last recording, ""B That Way,"" had run its course.

We feel confident that this project will not only be a worthy addition to my discography, but will also create a demand for concerts worldwide.
Not only will your support honor the great Mark Murphy and his formidable legacy, it will also create awareness for my artistry, to continue my quest to keep creating great music for you, and for all that enjoy this great art form.

<p><i>-FIND THE GERMAN VERSION BELOW-</i></p>
<p>Grown up in a family of musicians I had only one wish:</p>
<p>'Live my music dream'</p>
<p>Grew up in a little village in Germany, I was told to learn something ""serious"" and had a normal job. As no one could stop me from singing, I have become a professional session singer for different bands, which I did on the weekends, besides my ""normal life"". But I always dreamed of doing my own music. Therefore I gave it all up and moved to London in 2015 to pursue my dream. </p>
<p>Since then I am working together with big names in the industry, such as Alan Glass (Producer of Aretha Franklin), Ace (Skunk Anansie) or Kieron Pepper (Prodigy). </p>
<p>I've been very lucky to record and master my Debut single ""Caught in the Blues"" at the legendary Metropolis Studios, a recording studio where artists like Freddy Mercury, Adele, Amy Winehouse and more wrote music history with records produced at this magical place!</p>
<p> Listen here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/cheri-lyn/caught-in-the-blues"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/cheri-lyn/caught-in-the-...</a></p>
<p><strong>The project</strong></p>
<p>To build up on my career, I would love to produce a music video for my second single, called 'Showman' which took me 3 years to finish and hope to reach as many music lovers as I can! </p>
<p>I wrote ‘Showman’ in Chicago in a rush of inspiration from the blues music and the spirit of the city. My music is about love, passion and mostly about a women’s power with all its assets and charms.</p>
<p>""Showman"" was originally a song about the pole dance. For me it is a sexy sports in which you can reveal and live your hidden attractions. </p>
<p>My inspiration for the story developed, when I was in a Blues Club and I saw this dreamy looking man on stage.  An entertainer who - rumour has it - likes to give his fans private shows and knows how to play his games with women.</p>
<p>The ‘Showman’ didn’t get burnt until he met me. Well that happens when you play with fire….</p>
<p><strong>The mission</strong></p>
<p>With my music I want to bring back the spirit of 70's and 80's Blues/ Rock/ Soul music and deliver it with a modern swagger. My songs empower the benefit of being a woman and encourage to self- confidence and strength. I write about my own experiences, and the issues I had with love, friendship or life. How I have been grown as a woman and how I deal with deep situations, where I stay strong, positive and move on. </p>
<p>The video should help me to reach a wider fan base. I want to launch it together with my EP in April 2018. Further I plan to tour around Europe and the States in 2018, therefore I would appreciate if you follow me and support me to get me for a show into your town :)!</p>
<p><strong>The costs</strong></p>
<p>The time has come and within one’s reach! I need your help for this! The production of my music video would cost around €5200. We need to pay the video production company (4300€), make up artist (100€), rent a venue (200€), requisites (200€), produce the song (recording costs 300€, mastering 100€). If the money I raise is above that amount, I will invest it into the production costs of my first EP, which I want to release in April 2018. Of course you would be rewarded for your big heart and I would be incredibly thankful for!</p>
<p>You can get free downloads of my singles, exclusive backstage materials, t- shirts, living room concerts, become a part of the video, become VIP guests, get your own song of your choice or be part of my upcoming EP, to be released in April 2018. It would mean the world to me, if you support me.</p>
<p>Here a little sneak peak to my second single ‘Showman’ which is currently in the production process and will be the material for my music video:</p>

Leb deinen Traum
Aufgewachsen in einer Musiker Familie,
gab es für mich nur diesen einen Wunsch:
Meine Musik leben.
Ich bin Musikerin, Songwriterin  und Sängerin für Modern Blues/Rock/Soul. Nachdem ich jahrelang Front -Sängerin  bei verschiedenen deutschen Bands war, durch Europa, China und Japan touren durfte, entschied ich mich 2016 die Heimat zurück zu lassen ,  um mich in London mit meiner eigenen Musik zu etablieren.
Glücklicherweise bekam ich einen Studienplatz i m legendären Metropolis Tonstudio,  in dem Freddy Mercury, Adele, Amy Winehouse  und weitere namenhafte Künstler Innen ihre Hits produzierten.
Auch darf ich mit Größen  wie Alan Glass(ausgezeichnet mit Goldenen Schallplatten für Produktionen mit Aretha Franklin) oder Ace (Gitarrist Skunk Anansie) zusammen arbeiten.
Endlich konnte ich nun endlich meine erste Single ""Caught in the Blues"" veröffentlichen, welche in den Metropolis Studios aufgenommen wurde.
https://soundcloud.com/cheri-lyn/caught-in-the-...
Gefolgt wird das von einem Album,  und dazu möchte ich ein passendes Musikvideo drehen.
Das Projekt
Meine erste Single ""Caught in the  Blues""  erschien im Dezember.  Darauf aufbauend möchte ich für meine zweite Single ""Showman"" ein Musikvideo machen, um noch grössere Reichweite  zu bekommen.
Der Song “ Showman” dauerte insgesamt 3 Jahre  bis zur Vollendung. Ich war in Chicago und wurde inspiriert  durch den Blues und Spirit der Stadt .
Diese verruchten Clubs, in denen legendäre Musiker  sich auf der Bühne leidenschaftlich dem Blues hingaben,  liessen mich nur staunen.
Zeitgleich zu meiner Chicago Erfahrung, begann meine Schwester mit Poledance.
Ja, meine Musik ist über Liebe, Leidenschaft und vor allem die Stärke einer Frau, mit all ihren Vorzügen und Reizen.
""Showman"" war ursprünglich gedacht  als Loblied über den Tanz an der Stange: Zu viele prüde Vorurteile schockierten mich. Ich empfinde diese Sportart als sexy und befreiend.
Die andere Facette erhielt “Showman” durch eine Begegnung  in einem Blues Club : Da stand er plötzlich auf der Bühne, ein Traum von einem Mann,  der allen Frauen den Kopf verdreht, ein Entertainer, der bekanntlich auch gern mal private Zugaben  seinen Fans verpasste.
Der leibhaftige Showman lies nichts anbrennen, bis er zu mir gelang. Tja , wer mit dem Feuer spielt, sollte sich nicht verbrennen.
Die Zeit ist reif und der Traum zum  Greifen nah.
Hier die Zahlen:
Musikvideo: Kosten für Produktionsfirma ca 4300 Euro
Make Up Visagistin: 200 €
Requisiten: 100 €
Location mieten: 200 €
Produktionskosten des Songs: 300 €
Mastering des Songs: 100 €

Sollten die Einnahmen die 5200 € übersteigen,  fließen die Erlöse in die Kosten meiner EP, um Produktion und CD- Pressung zu decken. Die EP erscheint voraussichtlich im April.

We as a country and people will never be the same.          So began my stage play, Migrant Mother.          The date was March 9, 1936. The location was Nipomo, California. Fate intervened and the paths of two women crossed. The result of the encounter was the iconic photograph, “Migrant Mother.” An image that still haunts us today.          Dorothea Lange was taking photographs for the government, documenting the plight of migrants during the Great Depression. Florence Owens Thompson was taking care of her family, trying desperately to survive the hard times. These two women were very different, yet so very alike.          In January 2017, the Prospect Theater Project in Modesto presented a full production of Migrant Mother.          From the moment I began writing the play, I wanted a musical component and a musician/dramatic character to act as a Greek chorus. “Doc Guitar” was that character. I selected songs of the era for him to perform that reinforced the themes of the play – poverty, disenfranchisement, class struggle, the art of photography, the role of women in society, and the concept of framing reality. The songs I chose were powerful songs then and they still are today.            Don Setaro, a Modesto native and music producer/audio engineer, attended the last show. He was inspired by the performance of Andrew Durr as “Doc Guitar” and Andrew’s arrangements of the classic songs. He approached Jack Souza, artistic director of the Prospect Theater, and myself with the idea of creating a compact disc of the performances.

<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<p>Hi there!  We’re Oracle Blue, a Swank-Pop/Alt-Jazz band hailing from the Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina.  Oracle Blue began in the Music Department of Coastal Carolina University in the fall of 2013, when Zach Douglas, McKinley Devilbiss, Wade McMillan and Liz Kelley-Tavernier formed the first iteration of the CCU Jazz Combo (later joined by J.P. Taylor and Timothy Hardwick).</p>
<p>During our time at CCU we were given many incredible opportunities to learn from world-class musicians such as Victor Wooten, Steve Bailey, Jeff Coffin, Howard Levy, Quentin Baxter, and many others.  We also received a Student Music Award from DownBeat Magazine in the Pop/Rock/R&amp;B category and were invited by Montreux, Vienne and Umbria Jazz Festivals in Europe.   We were shown overwhelming support from our neighbors across the Grand Strand area making it possible for us to travel to Europe to perform at these festivals!  After a warm response both on tour and in our hometown we decided that we wanted to stay together after graduation.  Thus began the era of Oracle Blue!</p>
<p>This group has been a community effort since the time we all began playing music together as students, and it has remained so to this day.  That’s why we are inviting you to join us on this creative journey as we record our very first album.  With your support we believe that we can make something truly special.</p>
<h2>Plan &amp; Perks</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 for the production of this album.  We have decided to hire professionals to record, mix and master our album as want to present our music in the most pristine way possible!  We will also be raising money to cover printing expenses for the physical CDs as well as merchandise.  Each member in the band will be taking turns to post updates and keep you involved along the way!  We’ll be streaming live, offering insight on the composition of some of our original music, and allowing exclusive access to the entire creative process.  All for you!  We will even be hosting private concerts for those who give at certain tiers, as well as an after-party at our CD release show.</p>
<p>If we are not able to reach our entire goal we will still be moving forward with the funds that we do receive, just at a much slower pace.  Regardless of the outcome of this particular campaign, what you give will be going directly to getting our music recorded and pressed.</p>
<p>Below is a list of where the funds will be going as we move forward with the production of the record.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Time</li>
<li>Professional Mixing and Mastering</li>
<li>Printing CD’s</li>
<li>Merchandise Production / Shipping</li>
<li>Album Artwork/Design</li>
<li>Promotions, Ads, Getting our Music to the People!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hopes, Dreams, &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>We have had a wild ride so far, but we’re just getting started.  It has been so special to share the past few years together in the Myrtle Beach area (and a few weeks in Europe!), but we are ready to see how far we can take our music.  That’s why it’s incredibly important to us that we pour our hearts and souls into making this album the best that it can possibly be.  We’ve taken time to apply the musical knowledge that we’ve gained along the way, and we’ve been working on building a strong business plan to prepare for the next steps.  Our hope is that with a strong, professional product we can launch our band into performing at more high-caliber festivals, that we can develop a strong sound/brand, and that we can get our music into the right hands.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We realize that achieving our goal of $5,000 within a timeframe of 60 days may seem like a bit of a stretch.  This is not an all-or-nothing campaign, so we will still receive your donations even if we don’t reach our total goal.  That being said we will still be putting everything that we receive toward our recording fund, it will just move forward at a slower pace.  We have put an incredible amount of work and detail into composing our music and we plan to show the recording process the same level of respect and due-diligence.</p>
<h2>You Can Help!</h2>
<p>If you would like to help us spread the word, we would greatly appreciate it if you shared this campaign via social media!  You can do so by clicking on the icons at the top right corner of this page, right next to the welcome video.  The more buzz we’re able to generate, the more people hear about our album!  </p>
<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>So many people have sat through our student recitals, shown us support at restaurants around town that we’ve played at, and really, really helped us along the way.  We have been truly moved by the community support that we have received through the years, and we are well aware that nothing is possible without our tribe.  Thank you for helping us make the music happen!</p>

<p><strong>NEW 2019 CAMPAIGN: Stormarea51 indiegogo campaign<br/><br/>FBI agent;<br/><br/>Hello friends of Earth, my name is Special Agent Hook and I am friend from the inside. The inside of Area 51 in Rachel, NV. We have a grave issue in front of us. Last year in July of 2018 our brothers from another mother ship, the intergalactic band Brothers of Alien Rock revealed themselves to the world and how they have been here on our planet in observance since 1947 , all the while learning to rock from the biggest legends of music for the past 70 years. Collaborating in Secret with Hendrix,Van Halen,Elvis,Sabbath,Nirvana,Zeppelin and decades more. </strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>So here is the The real issue; when the band landed in Roswell,NM last year to perform at the annual UFO fest for the first time in human history_ they showed themselves publicy and were quickly abducted by the US government, and for the last year have been held with intentions unknown!<br/><br/>So since i am one of the administrators that runs Alien Rock HQ in the states, we were finally able to intercept a signal from the band, INSIDE the AREA51 facility - asking for our help in a covert rescue mission. Thanks to the organizers of the FB storm area51 movement, we have been given an unprecedented opportunity to save our rocking E.T.s from the clutches of this oppressive government agency. The transmission that we received from The band implicity tells us NOT to storm the gates at area51 because the government will know we are coming, but instead another option is presented for a sneak attack. The plans are hidden within the lyrics of their latest song that came along with this transmission titled ""Don't Storm The Gates!"". And we have a small sample of it here...(2019 CAMPAIGN)</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>The plan is We will meet up with all of the other attendees outside Area 51on Sept20th to break the band out of the facility , and then upon their new freedom They can perform a rock show of epic proportions for the entire world to witness. Therefore finally revealing the truth of what all the world's governments have been hiding from the rest of us; that we are not alone! <br/><br/>Also! we are stoked to be working on getting some REAL PLAYERS from the UFO research community, as well as true beings of Science and innovation to join us in the rescue!! Stay tuuuuuuuned <br/><br/>This is where we need your help... We have To transport all the equipment and supplies necessary for the band to speak to our planet at this epic event. This means moving the drums, amps, guitars,sound systems and merchandise  from our secret HQ in Florida out to the desert of Nevada. No small task but we believe in you! <br/><br/>Everybody here at Alien Rock Hq and the band wants to thank you in advance big time for the belief and support in making this happen. <br/><br/>The world is depending on your alliance!! JOIN US </strong></p>
<p><strong>************************************************************************</strong></p>
<p><i>ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN 2018:</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We are the Brothers of Alien Rock from the planet Rocktronamos, currently residing in sunny Orlando, Florida.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We came crashing here in New Mexico back in the late 40's with only our guitars on our backs. It was from there that we carried out a most passionate quest to learn the power of music through the greatest artists of your times; we played and wrote epic songs with Robert Johnson, Elvis,The Beetles, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Parliament, Van Halen, Nirvana and helped shape the face of Rock n Roll for 70+ years! </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529178417/j4xojw5i2fnjt4jh4afl.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>However we realized it was time to record our own masterpieces. and that is just what we did. Our first release, ""Landing "" blew out onto the scene in 2013 and now with our latest release, ""We Come From Outer Space"" it is time to continue the saga! </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529178530/a57isdntk6fkupujoorj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>So now after 71 years, The City of Roswell have invited us to find our way back home and play the biggest and most recognized UFO festival on the planet! One epic show in the New Mexico skies along with several appearances and events to get us reacquainted with Roswell. There will be photo ops,meet n greets, parades &amp; interviews with exclusive performances. Local rock radio in town is also ready to campaign together with us to make this a memorable experience. We are even shooting our next music video right on our original crash site from 1947!! We are so honored and humbled to be a part of this notable event!</strong></p>

<p><strong>We will be documenting every step of the way with all social media and also through an exclusive documentary named ""Road 2 Roswell"", The Experience - filled with all the madness only Aliens could get away with on such an epic journey in the deep southwest U.S.! This Doc will be available as one of the rewards, among so much more... we're sure that all of our terrestrial (and extra terrestrial) friends will love it. Join us in the journey home, the point of origin, the Road 2 Roswell! So what do we need to get to make this journey a reality?!??!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our friends at MainStreet Roswell are covering the lodging and food for us when we arrive in town however, there is a much more to cover with expenses than just showing up:</strong></p>

The inside of Area 51 in Rachel, NV. We have a grave issue in front of us. Last year in July of 2018 our brothers from another mother ship, the intergalactic band Brothers of Alien Rock revealed themselves to the world and how they have been here on our planet in observance since 1947 , all the while learning to rock from the biggest legends of music for the past 70 years. Collaborating in Secret with Hendrix,Van Halen,Elvis,Sabbath,Nirvana,Zeppelin and decades more. 
So here is the The real issue; when the band landed in Roswell,NM last year to perform at the annual UFO fest for the first time in human history_ they showed themselves publicy and were quickly abducted by the US government, and for the last year have been held with intentions unknown!So since i am one of the administrators that runs Alien Rock HQ in the states, we were finally able to intercept a signal from the band, INSIDE the AREA51 facility - asking for our help in a covert rescue mission. Thanks to the organizers of the FB storm area51 movement, we have been given an unprecedented opportunity to save our rocking E.T.s from the clutches of this oppressive government agency. The transmission that we received from The band implicity tells us NOT to storm the gates at area51 because the government will know we are coming, but instead another option is presented for a sneak attack. The plans are hidden within the lyrics of their latest song that came along with this transmission titled ""Don't Storm The Gates!"". And we have a small sample of it here...(2019 CAMPAIGN)
The plan is We will meet up with all of the other attendees outside Area 51on Sept20th to break the band out of the facility , and then upon their new freedom They can perform a rock show of epic proportions for the entire world to witness. Therefore finally revealing the truth of what all the world's governments have been hiding from the rest of us; that we are not alone! Also! we are stoked to be working on getting some REAL PLAYERS from the UFO research community, as well as true beings of Science and innovation to join us in the rescue!! Stay tuuuuuuuned This is where we need your help... We have To transport all the equipment and supplies necessary for the band to speak to our planet at this epic event. This means moving the drums, amps, guitars,sound systems and merchandise  from our secret HQ in Florida out to the desert of Nevada. No small task but we believe in you! Everybody here at Alien Rock Hq and the band wants to thank you in advance big time for the belief and support in making this happen. The world is depending on your alliance!! JOIN US 
************************************************************************
ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN 2018:
 
We are the Brothers of Alien Rock from the planet Rocktronamos, currently residing in sunny Orlando, Florida.
We came crashing here in New Mexico back in the late 40's with only our guitars on our backs. It was from there that we carried out a most passionate quest to learn the power of music through the greatest artists of your times; we played and wrote epic songs with Robert Johnson, Elvis,The Beetles, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Parliament, Van Halen, Nirvana and helped shape the face of Rock n Roll for 70+ years! 

However we realized it was time to record our own masterpieces. and that is just what we did. Our first release, ""Landing "" blew out onto the scene in 2013 and now with our latest release, ""We Come From Outer Space"" it is time to continue the saga! 

So now after 71 years, The City of Roswell have invited us to find our way back home and play the biggest and most recognized UFO festival on the planet! One epic show in the New Mexico skies along with several appearances and events to get us reacquainted with Roswell. There will be photo ops,meet n greets, parades & interviews with exclusive performances. Local rock radio in town is also ready to campaign together with us to make this a memorable experience. We are even shooting our next music video right on our original crash site from 1947!! We are so honored and humbled to be a part of this notable event!

We will be documenting every step of the way with all social media and also through an exclusive documentary named ""Road 2 Roswell"", The Experience - filled with all the madness only Aliens could get away with on such an epic journey in the deep southwest U.S.! This Doc will be available as one of the rewards, among so much more... we're sure that all of our terrestrial (and extra terrestrial) friends will love it. Join us in the journey home, the point of origin, the Road 2 Roswell! So what do we need to get to make this journey a reality?!??!
 
Our friends at MainStreet Roswell are covering the lodging and food for us when we arrive in town however, there is a much more to cover with expenses than just showing up:

We have a huge ensemble with a drum kit, amps and rigs for 2 guitars and bass, stage props, banners, merch and a crew of 7 (including the band) to tackle the driving, roadie and document the journey! 
In order to bring our crew, equipment and minor provisions we need a large vehicle and a trailer to roll out. We've whittled down the costs of food and hotels by deciding to pile into an RV, stocking up on eats and hauling alien arse out west! This is where we need your help;
The costs of transportation to get there (since our saucer is in the shop at the moment) include:
1) RV rental: 10 days - $200 per day and $700 for mileage = $2700
2) trailer 6x 12 cargo  = $300 
3) RV rest stops (not RV parks but we found out State parks are a 1/3 of the price!) $25 X 10 = $250 
4) Gas, tolls, general engine maintenance = $1000
Total = $4,250
Everything else we have covered like food,supplies, time off of the day gigs and the pure energy to rock!!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Singing and making music is a calling for me. I was a very shy and introspective kid, yet my desire to sing was so strong that I when I began performing in elementary school, my legs would shake and my face would turn bright red from nervousness. But something drove me to continue. I've come a long way as a musician and performer since then, from classical and operatic training to a cappella to writing and playing my own music.</p>
<p>I am a singer-songwriter and bass player, and my songs interweave poetic lyrics (many originally written as stand-alone poems) with bass and melody lines that draw from a variety of genres. Soulful, jazzy, and lush, my sound has been described as ""southern gothic,"" which I love. At a recent show, a friend who heard us play for the first time said the sound was unlike any other singer-songwriter he had ever heard, which I took as a huge compliment. </p>
<p>I recorded and released my first record, <i>Unbound</i>, in 2004 while living in New Orleans, with my previous band, M.J. Baby &amp; The Last Word. The last 15 years have been quite an amazing journey, and the songs on this new record, <i>Beautiful Illusions</i>, reflect upon both the joys and the depths I've navigated along the way. Some of them have been percolating since my time in New Orleans and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which brought me to Austin and forced me to rebuild my life from the ground up. Others are very fresh, with themes touching touch on love and loss, spirituality, pilgrimage, and the often-painful path to awakening.</p>
<p>My musical collaborators in this venture are Miguel Walker on guitar and backing vocals, Michelle Schreiber on drums and percussion, and Engineer/Producer Jason Mabry of Tomorrow Studio in Austin. Together we have already recorded demo versions of three of the songs for the album, the title track Beautiful Illusions (which you are hearing now), Scorpion Kiss, and Orion’s Bow. You can listen to these demo recordings in full on my website: <a href=""http://www.melindajoy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.melindajoy.com</a>. The album will contain 12 songs in all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your campaign donation you will receive a copy of the album once it is finished, plus a number of other fun gifts and goodies depending on the amount you contribute, including a ticket to our CD-Release party, a creativity retreat or series of creativity coaching sessions, a house concert, and more!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever we are able to raise to pay for studio time to record and produce the album, and I will personally finance the difference. If we raise more than our goal, I will use the extra funds to support other creatives in their work through sponsored artist residencies and scholarships for creativity workshops and retreats.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need art and creativity in this world, now more than ever. Music and art can help us to heal, to make meaning in our lives, and to offer new possibilities for healing our world and the planet.</p>
<p>In addition to my music making, I also work as a creativity coach and consultant. I completed my Ph.D. in psychology with a specialization in creativity studies in 2018 and I have several books on creativity in development and pending publication. I also lead workshops and retreats focusing on mindfulness and creativity, and I have developed several dedicated retreat spaces in Austin and the Texas Hill Country focusing on mindfulness, creativity, and sustainable living.</p>
<p>My mission is to provide opportunities for other creatives (and I believe that everyone is creative) to do their own deep work and cultivate their creative dreams, both individually and in group settings. Your contribution to this crowdfunding campaign will help sow the seeds of creativity not only for me personally, but for many others as well</p>

<h2><strong>Memphissippi Sounds</strong></h2>
<p>On a hot summer night in 2017, the paths of two uniquely talented musicians crossed in a club on the world famous Beale Street.  Called to perform on the same gig, Cameron Kimbrough, grandson of Mississippi blues legend Junior Kimbrough, combined his gritty vocals with the raw, stripped-down drum rhythms of his native hill country.  Damion “Yella P” Pearson added the soulful sound of his blues harp.  The end result was nothing less than musical magic.  </p>
<p>Their chance encounter led to an instant connection, with Cam and Yella teaming up to form what would eventually be known as Memphissippi Sounds.  Cam had grown up listening to the blues at his grandfather’s juke joint and later taught himself to play drums and guitar.  Yella P, also self-taught on the harmonica, first picked up the instrument at age 13, honing his style while listening to the blues on Beale Street. Their custom blend of North Mississippi hill country blues &amp; Memphis soul, blues, rock, pop, and hip-hop was debuted at the New Daisy while opening up for guitar legend Eric Gales.  In the past year, they’ve taken the Memphissippi Sound on the road to places such as Thacker Mountain Radio Hour in Oxford, Clarksdale’s Juke Joint Festival, and Little Rock’s Whitewater Tavern, backing Grammy-nominated bluesman R.L. Boyce.  Memphissippi Sounds has made local appearances at the Levitt Shell, Radio Memphis, and the Indie Memphis Film Festival.  Between gigs, they can be heard busking on Beale Street, much like musicians did in the heyday of Memphis music.</p>

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>In 1988, the Italian artist <strong>Al Aprile</strong> and his band recorded their first and last album. <strong>Al</strong> lived in Milan, he was a well known musician, a music journalist and DJ,  a music producer, and a bluesman.</p>
<p>The band had just completed the recording sessions, when the music label went bankrupt. After three years, guitarist and drummer found the money to buy the tapes. But Al Aprile had died in 1991, at the age of 31. His musicians released a limited and abridged version of the album, to remember him. This vinyl is very hard to find, today.</p>
<h3>The album</h3>
<p>This album by an obscure and forgotten Italian band can be considered the closing act of the Eighties. It's  a blend of dark, rock, wave, pop and blues music, with powerful lyrics describing a rich and enthusiastic world that is going to lose its compass. But in these songs, all the Eighties' darkest sides - money as the ultimate goal in life, heroin, AIDS, loss of hope... - are transfigured by the beauty of music: the farewell to the decade becomes a moving hymn to life.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To digitize and mastering the three tapes recorded at 30ips I need about 650 EUR.</li>
<li>Today, CD's are a no-go: they can't handle HD Audio, and it's more convenient downloading mp3 and FLAC files than ripping them. As for vinyl records, I can't find good vinyl pressing plants in central Europe using reel to reel tapes as source: making a vinyl plate from a digital file is a nonsense.</li>
<li>The album will be digitally released in audiophile quality: <strong>mp3</strong> (320kb), <strong>FLAC</strong>, <strong>HD Audio</strong> and <strong>DSD</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The main problem with this project is that <strong>the tapes were recorded at a very high speed</strong> - 30ips or 76.2cm/s. Finding a postproduction studio owning a perfect 30ips player <u>and</u> very high quality analog to digital (AD) converters was a challenge. After a quite long research and several audio tests, I found it in Berlin: excellent equipments and sound engineer, quite expensive service.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am a quite solitary man, and don't have much experience with social networks. But I would be very grateful if you could spread info about this campaign on Facebook and other platforms.</p>

Today, CD's are a no-go: they can't handle HD Audio, and it's more convenient downloading mp3 and FLAC files than ripping them. As for vinyl records, I can't find good vinyl pressing plants in central Europe using reel to reel tapes as source: making a vinyl plate from a digital file is a nonsense.
The album will be digitally released in audiophile quality: mp3 (320kb), FLAC, HD Audio and DSD.


Challenges
The main problem with this project is that the tapes were recorded at a very high speed - 30ips or 76.2cm/s. Finding a postproduction studio owning a perfect 30ips player and very high quality analog to digital (AD) converters was a challenge. After a quite long research and several audio tests, I found it in Berlin: excellent equipments and sound engineer, quite expensive service.

Other Ways You Can Help
I am a quite solitary man, and don't have much experience with social networks. But I would be very grateful if you could spread info about this campaign on Facebook and other platforms.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Marshall Jones, I am a composer living in Kalispell, Montana. I currently serve as Director of Music Ministries at Bethlehem Lutheran Church and as an adjunct professor at Flathead Valley Community College. </p>
<p>In February 2020, my orchestral work ""Paramnesis"" was selected for inclusion on ABLAZE Records next volume in their Orchestral Masters series. ABLAZE Records is a label that works with and champions the work of living composers. Paramnesis will be recorded with the Brno Philharmonic in the Czech Republic during the summer of 2020 under the direction of Mikel Toms. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Thankyou for checking me out. I'm an independent artist in Los Angeles looking for funding for my next two projects, a 4 song EP ""Nightmare"" and a full album ""Cool Girl"". I write, perform, and produce every single song myself in my little bedroom studio. The genre of my music ranges from contemporary pop with jazz and rnb influences, to indie pop. My EP Nightmare will consist of Indie RnB Pop, and Cool Girl will be a mixture of RnB Pop and Contemporary Alternative Pop! I cut a lot of costs being my own producer. But your contribution will help me get all my songs professionally mixed, mastered, along with professional Cover art, Music Videos, and marketing ads. You will truly help me get my projects off the ground running and help me accomplish my dreams!!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each song costs 500 dollars to have professionally mixed, Nightmare will have 4 songs, and Cool Girl will have 10, so 14x500= 7,000</li>
<li>Mastering cost's 200 for each song, plus an extra 50 for alternative ""Radio"" versions of each song (Most of my songs have explicit lyrics) so 250x14= 3,500</li>
<li>I need 2,500 for a good lawyer to make a good management contract deal with my Manager!</li>
<li>I hire professional musicians to play on songs that need live instruments, I want to allot 1,000 dollars for this</li>
<li>Marketing (Youtube ads, Facebook ads, Ads, on Instagram)  I want to allot 500 for this</li>
<li>1,500 for a professional Music Video</li>

<li>Anyone who makes a contribution of 500 dollars or more will receive a private link to one of the unreleased songs of ""Nightmare"" or ""Cool Girl""!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>I want my music to inspire other artists and humans to be exactly who they are, and not put themselves in one genre box. And when I write my songs, I don't just write simple "" I got my heart broken"" or ""why don't you like me"" songs. I try to really describe exactly how I feel in real life situations that everyone faces. I want you to feel like yes, someone has been exactly here before, and I want to give you the way to feel better about these situations.

I am hopeful that I can send you copies of the new album, tentatively titled Down Below, in time for the holidays. With a little money saved from the proceeds of our last album and the generous support of a local music patron, I was able to cover the studio costs as we went. Going forward our budget is as follows:Mixing $1500Mastering $600Album Artwork $250-500Manufacturing $3000Promo in Radio and Print $1000-$3000I'm really excited about this new set of songs and the musicians have done an amazing job bringing them to life. I can't wait to get these into your hands!I'm keeping the incentives pretty simple this time around. They will include pre-orders of the new album, new Gas Station Guru T-shirts, albums and CDs from our back catalogue, and solo front porch or back yard concerts. My goal is to raise enough money to print albums and CDs with this campaign. I'll look to other sources for the remainder of the costs. I thank you in advance for your generosity in bringing this music to fruition. Ted Hefko",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Brenda Carsey. The art I create and what inspires me to the core is music and community.  </p><p>I find myself drawn to a path of service through creating safe spaces for people of all walks of life to come together, be themselves, and make friends. It wasn’t until recently that I accepted my passion for Creating and Holding space for others as part of my art. When my partner Will first told me that community was at the very center of who I am as an artist I didn’t believe him. I told him “Bringing people together is not art, it’s just logistics and planning and a fun hobby”. But now, two years down the line since he shared those words with me, I see what he truly meant. My art is community and the medium I work in and share that through is music. Music is my absolute joy and is my way of connecting with others.</p><p>Three years ago I opened myself and my art fully to you with my very first crowdfunding campaign. It was both a beautiful and intense experience. Sharing my story publicly, reflecting on myself, my life, what exactly my art was, how I wanted to grow, what my goals were to get there, and asking for help... the whole process was tremendously transforming for me and challenged me in ways I had never experienced. With the support of 168 people -- family, friends, and fans -- I was able to successfully meet and surpass my financial goal which truly kickstarted my advancement, my motivation, my business knowledge, and my willingness to make sacrifice to see something massive through to the end.

In only six and a half days we tracked drums, bass, piano, lead vocals, harmonies, guitar, cello, violin, trumpet, tenor sax, and baritone sax for 10 songs of what would eventually become my album ""Solitary Refinement"". Working with engineer and co-producer Brian Frederick and a handful of talented and wonderful musicians, we created something truly unique and inspiring. After tracking, we went into mixing the album, leaving a full eight hour work day plus extra half day for notes for each song! After all of the tracking was done, we did mastering, another full 8 hour work day. All of this amidst juggling a day job, gigging in evenings, curating community events, spending time with family, friends, commuting, and all the other normal unexpected oddities life brings. After all of the beauty of creation and perfecting was complete, I then started working on album art, music video concepts, merchandise, fulfilling and packaging all of the rewards for everyone who had donated, and planning the album release show and album tour. 100% of the money raised from that first crowdfunding campaign went into the making of the album from capturing the music to compensating everyone who performed to mixing and mastering the album to packaging and distribution.

I began by messing around and writing on my family upright piano and would also use my clarinet sheet music and choir music to dabble deeper into the instrument that fills me with joy! I have not yet had the opportunity in my life to record an album featuring me playing on a <i>real piano</i>. As a pianist I feel I must have this experience. To capture my music on a real grand piano, in a room with beautiful acoustics, capturing every nuance, every overtone, every reverberating note, would truly be a dream and bring so much warmth and realness to the music and to the record.</p><h3><strong>••• The Sound •••</strong></h3><p>This album can sonically be described primarily as 'Alternative Soul’ and secondarily as ""Progressive Pop"", two genres that I have coined for myself after playing all across the country and locally in Los Angeles with a myriad of band set-ups for a wide variety of people. The songs are extraordinarily honest, exposed, and keep the listener guessing. There is a feeling of freedom, poetic lyrics accompanied by fluid melodies, engaging chord progressions, funky rhythms, and a voice filled with passion and soul. My vision includes piano, Rhodes, voice, harmonies, drums, bass, guitar, and strings and possibly horns too! No holding back for this sonic creation! The music for this album has not yet been recorded!

What is at stake is this music and this message not reaching as wide of an audience as I hope and envision for it and prolonged production processes due to my not meeting my financial goal. Each component of this project is incredibly important and needed for complete success — from making the best album with the best musicians and best audio engineer and sound team we can to packaging everything beautifully with compelling visual art in the form of photography and video to touring and marketing the album so it has a chance at thriving and expanding. From writing 16 songs, I will be narrowing them down to 10 to 12 songs for the album that really share my story, my observations of the world around me, my experiences, and my love from the past two years. This album shares messages of community, transparency, love, growing, partying, family relationships, overcoming depression, acknowledging pain, and more. I can't wait to share this music with YOU!</p><h2><strong>••• How Can You Help? •••</strong></h2><p>In order to bring this project to life, I NEED your help.

I am so excited to reach out for help and to bring a team and a community together to be part of the creation of this album!••• Real Piano •••I have been playing piano since the age of 10. I began by messing around and writing on my family upright piano and would also use my clarinet sheet music and choir music to dabble deeper into the instrument that fills me with joy! I have not yet had the opportunity in my life to record an album featuring me playing on a real piano. As a pianist I feel I must have this experience. To capture my music on a real grand piano, in a room with beautiful acoustics, capturing every nuance, every overtone, every reverberating note, would truly be a dream and bring so much warmth and realness to the music and to the record.••• The Sound •••This album can sonically be described primarily as 'Alternative Soul’ and secondarily as ""Progressive Pop"", two genres that I have coined for myself after playing all across the country and locally in Los Angeles with a myriad of band set-ups for a wide variety of people. The songs are extraordinarily honest, exposed, and keep the listener guessing. There is a feeling of freedom, poetic lyrics accompanied by fluid melodies, engaging chord progressions, funky rhythms, and a voice filled with passion and soul. My vision includes piano, Rhodes, voice, harmonies, drums, bass, guitar, and strings and possibly horns too! No holding back for this sonic creation! The music for this album has not yet been recorded! But you can get a little live taste of 4 of the songs here!“Party’s Over”“Unfortunate Men”“Home”“Rebel Walls”••• What's at Stake? •••I've put every ounce of my soul into this project and into living genuinely for my passion and believing in myself. What is at stake is this music and this message not reaching as wide of an audience as I hope and envision for it and prolonged production processes due to my not meeting my financial goal. Each component of this project is incredibly important and needed for complete success — from making the best album with the best musicians and best audio engineer and sound team we can to packaging everything beautifully with compelling visual art in the form of photography and video to touring and marketing the album so it has a chance at thriving and expanding. From writing 16 songs, I will be narrowing them down to 10 to 12 songs for the album that really share my story, my observations of the world around me, my experiences, and my love from the past two years. This album shares messages of community, transparency, love, growing, partying, family relationships, overcoming depression, acknowledging pain, and more. I can't wait to share this music with YOU!••• How Can You Help? •••In order to bring this project to life, I NEED your help. Your contributions will literally change my life. Not only by allowing me to create and share the best album we can make but also by inspiring me with your support and belief, allowing me to share the message of “Cognizance” - a state of being aware with knowledge gained from personal experience. You will be in my heart and mind throughout the creation process and after as we share what YOU helped make possible.Please1) Click the pink ""Back It"" button now at the top right of this page!2) Choose an amount you feel good about and select the accompanying reward. I have thought very deeply about these rewards and have done my best to make them fun, unique, and memorable as a token of my appreciation for your help!3) Tell your friends! Share this IndieGogo link everywhere you can - this is a HUGE help! Places you can help to share the message: Facebook posts on your wall, in your stories, or private messages; Instagram posts and stories; Email, Twitter, Tumblr, Snapchat, etc. Let’s get this IndieGogo page out into the world throughout our circles of family and friends and beyond!••• Anticipated Costs and Breakdown •••Making The Album - $20,700​I have spent six months meeting with different producers and engineers and visiting different studio spaces to find the right space, the right team, the right attitude, and to forecast a realistic budget for recording this album. Funds will go towards covering:studio time • the audio engineer • producer • musicians day rates • mixing • masteringVinyl And Online Distribution - $4,600It has always been my dream to create a vinyl album. There is something truly special about vinyl records: the tones, the warmth, the liveliness, the tangibility of it all, the printed front and back cover artwork. It is sincerely a work of art. And I wholeheartedly feel this is my time, this is the album, these are the songs that are meant to be pressed into a timeless piece of auditory art. I would love to have this available for those who enjoy listening to music in this way and as an artifact that can live on past me. The album will also of course be available on all major music platforms online. Funds will go towards covering:album artwork design (photographer, location, editing, formatting)  • vinyl manufacturing • costs associated with submitting music for digital distributionMusic Video - $3000Visual art is incredibly important to me and is as much a part of the album as the music. We will create at least one professional and beautiful piece of visual art to represent the albums flavor, texture, and meaning through video.Funds will go towards covering:director • videographer • lighting • actors • video editing • coloringRewards Manufacturing and Shipment - $1000Costs incurred from making rewards and safely shipping out rewards with appropriate packaging - (vinyl, polaroid pictures, posters, t-shirts, stickers, pins)Marketing via Tour + Press - $10,000After waiting patiently for two years and doing everything in my power to find the perfect space, perfect team, and perfect musicians, I cannot wait to finally create “Cognizance”! But what happens after? I am an independent artist with no label or management team. I would very much like to publicize this album to the world as best I can! — to give “Cognizance"" a real chance of finding its audience, so people outside of my circle of family, friends, and local fans can hear the music. Promotional costs can be exponential. I will promote as resourcefully as possible to maximize the results.Funds will go towards covering:Album release tour (transportation, musicians, lodging, gear rental) • PR to promote the album in well-known magazines, blogs, radio, playlists••• Risks and challenges •••There are many unforeseen challenges that can occur but I feel confident in the team I have put together and confident in my work ethic and passion to make the completion of this album happen no matter what! The main challenge will be creating, manufacturing, and mailing out/sending/performing the rewards in a quick (though not rushed) amount of time. But I can say confidently, WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER! And I can't wait!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About The Album</h3>
<p>'Brush Strokes' brings the classic sounds of jazz rhythms, vibes, and instrumentation into the world of hip-hop. Freak Tha Monsta crafted the boom bap soundscape that jumps around from the fast-paced heist adventure to the sultry love letter to the empowering, uplifting anthem, and so on. Freak and Miggs offer the familiar NY lyricism and are joined by the soulful MothaBug on vocals. The three weave in and out of Freak's dynamic jazzy production to create a flavorful collection of tracks. Basslines throughout are provided by Jeff DeRosa. Some cuttin' and scratchin' by DJ Akil, and the album is hosted by Savannah legend Ike Carter. In the words of Mr. Carter, ""Prepare yourself for a wonderful experience...""</p>

'Brush Strokes' brings the classic sounds of jazz rhythms, vibes, and instrumentation into the world of hip-hop. Freak Tha Monsta crafted the boom bap soundscape that jumps around from the fast-paced heist adventure to the sultry love letter to the empowering, uplifting anthem, and so on. Freak and Miggs offer the familiar NY lyricism and are joined by the soulful MothaBug on vocals. The three weave in and out of Freak's dynamic jazzy production to create a flavorful collection of tracks. Basslines throughout are provided by Jeff DeRosa. Some cuttin' and scratchin' by DJ Akil, and the album is hosted by Savannah legend Ike Carter. In the words of Mr. Carter, ""Prepare yourself for a wonderful experience...""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hey ya'll So I am Jordan Brodie and I am Mr. Orange County Pride 2019.</p>
<p>Today is my Birthday. I'm turning 28 and all I want is for ya'll to donate to my fundraiser for the Human Rights Campaign. My idea is to get a song I wrote called ""We Are the Future"" recorded and produced. Then make a fun video to promote advocacy for LGBTQiA Rights.</p>
<p>As Mr. OC Pride my platform is Volunteering and Voting so I will be doing a volunteer fair as well as a politcal drag show this year to raise money to support Orange County Pride, The Orange County Imperial Court and The Human Rights Campaign.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign has advocated for LGBTQiA Rights for more then a decade and are the reason why some laws are being changed in support of Equality for all. I want to support them and give back to them because attending their yearly conference Time To Thrive changed my life.</p>
<p>So, Please dig deep if you can. It means so much to me and us all.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So to get a song produced it takes me about 8-12 hours with a producer at the rate of 60$to 120$ an hour.</p>
<p>Then to get a video made. I've got to hire a camera crew and performers at various rates. Which can be 4-5 people at 60$to 120$ an hour and up. I'm going to do my best to get as much volunteers as I can to keep the cost down because this will all be for charity.</p>
<p>But, having some funding will help..</p>
<p>Some of the perks of your donation include.</p>
<p>Production Credits,</p>
<p>Participation in Video,</p>
<p>Personal Thank you card,</p>
<p>Personal Thank you video,</p>
<p>Song Written for you,</p>
<p>Solo Performance for you (local only if you're far I can do a video or livestream performance,</p>
<p>and more please check out the perks.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jordan Brodie</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When we give our money to non-profits we invest in ourselves and the future of our society. The human rights campaign is working hard to ensure the we have safe feature and I want to create this song with a powerful message to help remind our next generation that they have the rights to be involved and stand up for our equality. =D</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks involved are the hate from people who do not support the LGBTQ people. I myself have been bullied and made fun of by homophobic people. the more work we do to spread awareness and advocate the smaller the gap becomes between our communities. Lets's make a difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate you can simply share this with the share tools and encourage friends to donate. or attend my volunteer and political drag show later in the year. There will be plenty of ways for you to be involved.</p>

<li>If you were planning to record a live album, you’d restring your guitars, make sure your vocal pipes were in tip top condition, maybe select an appropriate venue, invite a specially selected audience, hire an awesome sound engineer and The Manor Mobile, and rehearse the heck out of the specially selected songs that you were going to play.</li>
<li>Well, if only! Those of you who know me will know that I straddle genres between blues, country rock and West Coast Hippy stuff, so a live gig reflects this. I hadn’t planned to record this gig but realised that I had my digital recorder in my kit bag. I flipped it to record in Wav, set it down next to the stage, and pressed record, and played 2 sets to a fairly attentive audience.</li>
<li>A day later I though I would check the quality of the recording from an audio point of view. It sounded pretty good for what it was. A little later I decided that I would listen to it to see if it was worth some work to release as a live album, so i listened to each track from 3 viewpoints: 1 - is this a song that doesn’t appear on either of my other CDs (one of which is also live) - if it does appear on one of those CDS, is this performance better - given that I have been performing the songs for a lot longer now. 2 is the vocal performance up to scratch 3 Is the guitar performance up to scratch - no fluffed notes or out of tune guitars.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I need:</strong></p>

<p>Funds to allow for replication of the CD from a glass master</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Steve Schuster. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m a singer/songwriter and recording artist. I’ve been writing original indie, classic-rock-style music for over 40 years, including my latest two albums “Sweet Gems” and “Unassembled Man.”</p>
<p>Here on Indiegogo, I’m asking for your help to fund what I hope will become a classic music video and children’s book based on my new unreleased song called “When We Imagine.”</p>
<p>When We Imagine represents a labor of love, born of my vision of inspiring kids of all ages, starting with my 2-year-old grandson Joey who inspired the song. It’s a song that compels kids to be open-minded, free thinkers that realize that anything at all is possible when we imagine.</p>
<p>With your help on this campaign, we can together celebrate the power of imagination by bringing this video and kids book to life.</p>
<p>Thanks so much. With your generous help, anything can happen for these kids – anything at all when we imagine!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll be working with Italian animator Sara Soncini, a genuine talent experienced with creating music videos and creative videos for children, combining fun and learning. Sara's fee for creating the full-length animation is $1500 USD.</li>
<li>My stretch goal is to fund the development of a companion book to the song and video. I envision printing some example copies and then circulating it to children's book publishers.</li>
<li>I also envision starting the When We Imagine Foundation to bring educational music to children in underprivileged circumstances.</li>
<li>Depending on how the campaign goes, I'll apply any excess funds to the development of a second children's video of another unreleased song, ""Sassafras Supersonic,"" and beyond that to the recording of my next album (already written!).</li>
<li>Even if I don't make my funding goal, I'll apply all funds to the animation of ""When We Imagine."" I'm committed to making this happen!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By joining the We Can Imagine journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be an instrumental (no pun intended) part of launching an instant classic children's song, video and book</li>
<li>You will be supporting the indie rock music movement</li>
<li>You will help make a positive impact that encourages kids to use their sky-is-the-limit power of imagination</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is relatively low risk, but</p>
<ul><li>The animator could conceivably cancel, requiring securing a new animator, delaying delivery of several of the perks</li></ul>

Many of you have accompanied me on this journey where I’ve had the opportunity to share this music and my experiences directly through performances and community workshops as well as my online tutorials and instructional books. But what you might not know is that I have been working for the past 2 years developing a new sound for Nation Beat that I’m really excited to finally share with you.  I’d like to invite you to join us on the next stop of this musical journey. </p><h3>A New Recording by Nation Beat</h3><p>In an increasingly globalized music industry our sound aims to reach into the roots-based traditions and bring those voices to the surface by creating cross-cultural music that impacts the people around us and assures our similarities are stronger than our differences. Our new album is a contemporary call-and-response where brass band and percussion explode in a jazz-infused, funkified New Orleans-meets-Brazil carnival sound.  These explorations are not only exciting musically but they cultivate diverse relationships which empower us to find common ground beyond the music.  Nation Beat's new album will be released on CD, vinyl and digital formats which will be distributed world wide. We will record in late April and release it in November, 2019.</p><p>The music will showcase original compositions and standards from Brazil and New Orleans featuring horn arrangements by my good friend and musical partner Paul Carlon.  Nation Beat also features the talents of Joe Correia on sousaphone, Mariel Bildsten on trombone and Mark Collins on trumpet. They’ve been working really hard developing the new sound with me for the past year. </p><h3>Independent Music Needs You - To Stay Alive <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549404240/pchjwridsvjog7z6schj.png"" src=""""/>
</h3><p>As you probably know, making an album is a very expensive process - especially to do it right.  The reality of today’s music industry is that people more and more expect music to be free. In order for us to make our music come to life, we need your support. For those of you who have supported us all this time, we thank you and hope you will continue your support.  For all you newcomers, we hope you will see the value of our musical explorations and choose to support us.</p><p>The Indiegogo platform allows us to offer our community of friends and fans music, merch, and memories in exchange for your crucial support. When you support this project, you’re joining our Nation. Together, we can make something special that will last forever. </p><h3>HYBRID EDUCATION – Music Minus One</h3><p>I’m also excited to develop the <i>Music Minus One</i> learning module. As an educator, I’m constantly exploring and implementing new ways of enriching the learning experiences of my students and future generations of musicians.  The educational component of this project will help expand my hybrid teaching platform where students learn through online digital media.   Once the new album is recorded I will create a <i>Music Minus One</i> version which will be used as a learning tool for student drummers and percussionists. I will develop learning modules that exclude the drum tracks on the recording so the student can practice along with the band, without the original drum track.  This is an important learning tool for young drummers as it guides them on the exploration of developing a unique voice while being closely related to the traditional rhythms. These play-alongs will be made available through my online academy (worlddrumlessons.com) which currently has over 200 monthly student subscribers worldwide.  Music Minus One will also be made available at our school residencies as well as to my students at the School of Jazz (New School University).   </p><h3>Where Does Your Money Go? </h3><p>If you’re interested to know where your money will go for this professional recording project, below is a breakdown of our working budget to record, manufacture, and promote this album the absolute best we can.  The money that is not raised on this IGG campaign will be supplemented by private and personal funding. </p><p>Production (Studio, Musicians, Producer, &amp; Mixing): $6,500</p><p>Mastering: $800</p><p>Artwork/Graphic Design: $1000</p><p>CD &amp; Vinyl Manufacturing: $3,500</p><h3>Timeline</h3><p>April 22-24, 2019: Record the album</p><p>May 13-15, 2019: Mixing the album</p><p>May 27-28: Mastering the album</p><p>October 31, 2019: You will be dancing to our music in your own home!</p><div> </div><div>

But what you might not know is that I have been working for the past 2 years developing a new sound for Nation Beat that I’m really excited to finally share with you.  I’d like to invite you to join us on the next stop of this musical journey. A New Recording by Nation BeatIn an increasingly globalized music industry our sound aims to reach into the roots-based traditions and bring those voices to the surface by creating cross-cultural music that impacts the people around us and assures our similarities are stronger than our differences. Our new album is a contemporary call-and-response where brass band and percussion explode in a jazz-infused, funkified New Orleans-meets-Brazil carnival sound.  These explorations are not only exciting musically but they cultivate diverse relationships which empower us to find common ground beyond the music.  Nation Beat's new album will be released on CD, vinyl and digital formats which will be distributed world wide. We will record in late April and release it in November, 2019.The music will showcase original compositions and standards from Brazil and New Orleans featuring horn arrangements by my good friend and musical partner Paul Carlon.  Nation Beat also features the talents of Joe Correia on sousaphone, Mariel Bildsten on trombone and Mark Collins on trumpet. They’ve been working really hard developing the new sound with me for the past year. Independent Music Needs You - To Stay Alive 
As you probably know, making an album is a very expensive process - especially to do it right.  The reality of today’s music industry is that people more and more expect music to be free. In order for us to make our music come to life, we need your support. For those of you who have supported us all this time, we thank you and hope you will continue your support.  For all you newcomers, we hope you will see the value of our musical explorations and choose to support us.The Indiegogo platform allows us to offer our community of friends and fans music, merch, and memories in exchange for your crucial support. When you support this project, you’re joining our Nation. Together, we can make something special that will last forever. HYBRID EDUCATION – Music Minus OneI’m also excited to develop the Music Minus One learning module. As an educator, I’m constantly exploring and implementing new ways of enriching the learning experiences of my students and future generations of musicians.  The educational component of this project will help expand my hybrid teaching platform where students learn through online digital media.   Once the new album is recorded I will create a Music Minus One version which will be used as a learning tool for student drummers and percussionists. I will develop learning modules that exclude the drum tracks on the recording so the student can practice along with the band, without the original drum track.  This is an important learning tool for young drummers as it guides them on the exploration of developing a unique voice while being closely related to the traditional rhythms. These play-alongs will be made available through my online academy (worlddrumlessons.com) which currently has over 200 monthly student subscribers worldwide.  Music Minus One will also be made available at our school residencies as well as to my students at the School of Jazz (New School University).   Where Does Your Money Go? If you’re interested to know where your money will go for this professional recording project, below is a breakdown of our working budget to record, manufacture, and promote this album the absolute best we can.  The money that is not raised on this IGG campaign will be supplemented by private and personal funding. Production (Studio, Musicians, Producer, & Mixing): $6,500Mastering: $800Artwork/Graphic Design: $1000CD & Vinyl Manufacturing: $3,500TimelineApril 22-24, 2019: Record the albumMay 13-15, 2019: Mixing the albumMay 27-28: Mastering the albumOctober 31, 2019: You will be dancing to our music in your own home!

<h3>Woman In Music </h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Alysha Brilla; born Alysha Mohamed. I grew up in Brampton, Ontario, but have lived in KW for over half of my life now. I've been in the music industry since I was thirteen years old.  17 years later and the songs keep flowing, thanks to you. <br/><br/>I signed a major U.S. Record Deal when I was in my late teens and entered the weird and wonderful world of Hollywood. I lived in L.A. for a while as one of the only women of South Asian ancestry signed to a deal...and dealt with a lot of the isms that come along with the industry and my own share of #metoo experiences that ultimately led to me moving back to Canada, producing my own records and having them be nominated for Juno Awards...three times! It has all been such a long and winding journey and has also flown by in what feels like a flash. It hasn't been easy, especially taking the road less travelled, but it has been full of lessons, incredible people and of course...beautiful music. I am still creating because of the support of my friends, family and community. I have had the wonderful experience of singing backup for amazing artists, playing keyboard for some of my musical heroes and now I have a new album I would love to share with you. Throughout the years, I have been connecting with other women and non-binary people in the music world to strengthen the representation of female producers and femme people in decision-making positions and creative roles. We still have a long way to go, but I picture the ideas, visions and expressions of women being highlighted in our global consciousness because I think a balance can be held in the energy and trajectory of the songs we hear and the world we live in.<br/><br/>I am in the process of writing and recording my fifth independently produced and released album titled ""The Body"" and I would love for you to be a part of the process and support by pre-ordering your copy and other associated goodies in this campaign. You become my record label and your support will help me make and produce a powerful album I feel I can take around the world with meaningful messages and sounds that incorporate nature and the human voice. Despite everything going on in the world, I feel more centred now than I ever have before in my life and this music business and I would love to share these new songs in a beautiful way with you.<br/><br/>""The Body"" is a collection of new songs inspired by my life's experience as a human incarnate with autoimmune issues and the relationship I see between our individual body and the body of mother earth. I have experienced disbalance and disease, but also unbelievable strength, resilience and healing. I have seen a lot of the world and our planet from a unique artist and community centred perspective and I want to share my insights of connections between love and physics, biology and spirituality within a musical format. We are at such a critical juncture during human civilization where I really feel art and community creating art together is one of the quickest ways we heal and bridge emotional gaps. ""The Body"" will feature instrumentation from India including the Veena, tabla, voice and string section. As I produce this album, I will intentionally be supporting female and non-binary musicians, engineers and artists to create a living example of what is possible. Shout out to all of the amazing men I have worked with and who have supported this equitable vision since the awareness came to you. It takes all of us having a new vision to make it come to light. You are key players and I couldn't have made it this far without your generosity of heart. Let's make a healing album. I want to take this record on tour across Canada and elsewhere next year and build community around the musicians I perform with and you at the shows. #TheBody</p>

<h3>Spotify + How Does an Artist make a living?</h3>
<p>Spotify pays $0.0084 per stream and this means that even with 1,000,000 streams, which I just hit this year (woohoo), that's only $1400 per year my song has been up there. That's $116/month, which is...enough to pay my phone bill? To be honest; people buy physical CD's less and less, so the best way you can support an artist is to pre-order the album. If you love listening to my music, following my social media (Instagram/Facebook/Twitter) or reading my blogs, the best way you can support that continued flow of content is to contribute to this current album fundraiser and keep listening and sharing my music. Who knows...maybe this record will be such a hit that I'll be able to build a recording studio in a tiny house and you can all come to my funny farm and we can celebrate!?<br/> </p>

<p>I offer this album as a medicine to support the healing of the deeper underlying sicknesses that humanity faces in this moment. Music has the magic, powerful and mysterious ability to go deep to the roots within us, to help us to heal, to feel, to call us back to our hearts... to Guide us home.</p>
<p>These songs speak of the journey of remembering who we truly are, where we really come from and what we are here for. They honour that which is Sacred, the Elements, the Ancestors, the Earth, the Sky, the Wisdom of the invisible kingdom, the Spirit world, the whispers of the Silent Voices that are guiding and reminding us that we are all part of a holy creation, all related, all a breath of the Great Spirit of life.</p>
<p>This album is my offering to the world in this pivotal moment of humanity, my prayer that we may reweave the Sacred web of Life and hand to our children a beautiful world that is thriving. It my offering of gratitude to the spirit world and to the beloved Earth that is our Mother.</p>

</p><p><b>Who is Ray Of Lightss?</b></p>
<p>My name is Ray
Of Lightss. I am an honorably discharged veteran of the United States Marine
Corps who served his country in the Vietnam War. Also, I am a disciple of Jesus
Christ, Who has given me the ministry of anointed healing music. I am
contacting all my old friends, and my future friends, for fellowship in the giving
and receiving of healing love. I am blessed and highly favored of the Lord to
come out the closet with thousands of writings, music and photography that I
will share with you who contribute to my new Ray Of Lightss’ Crowd-funding
Campaign. After studying all aspects of music for fourteen years—and having
earned five certificates and a Degree in music production—God has inspired me
to go back into the recording studio to record some new original healing gospel
pop sounding songs. Some of my last recordings were rushed, and could have
sounded better if I had had the time and budget to go back in for enhancement,
like all major artists do. This time, I want to have enough time and a
$20,000.00 budget to do the best music I can do that will stand with any of the
pop music that's out today. Because of my eight years of recording education at one of
the best recording environments, that was at Long Beach City College, and that
could stand with the best in the world, and that had some of the hottest and
loving instructors on Earth; I now know more about sound and acoustics, then
when I recorded in studios years before. This $20,000.00 budget will enable me
to hire the best gospel musicians in the world—whom I have relationships
with—and who are standing by and willing to help bring my vision to the public.
I even know the recording engineer who has a fantastic studio with loads of
analog and digital recording gear. He is ready to sit at the recording and
mixing board to help bring this healing vision into the light also. This
estimated budget includes $14,000.00 for musicians, $2,500.00 for studio time,
$2,500.00 for the recording, mixing and mastering engineers, $500.00 for
multimedia and $500.00 for the production and mailings of perks and rewards. As
you can see, this has the extra benefit of you and I’m putting at least ten people
to work!</p>
