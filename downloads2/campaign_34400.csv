<h3>Victoria (Tori) needs help to win a scholarship</h3>
<p>Tori maintains a 4.0 GPA and excels at Basketball and track despite the grueling schedule and hardships associated with life on a poor Native American Indian reservation in Eastern Washington.</p>
<p>Currently, she is in her high school basketball season, she’s a 4 year varsity player. She has recently been asked by the Spokane Legacy Select Basketball Team to travel with them to all NCAA Sanctioned basketball tournaments. Here is where she will get the needed exposure, to play in front of college scouts and coaches at all levels. I would like to be able to assist her in any way possible to make this happen for her. She would love to not only play on this team, but possibly be in contact with prospective coaches to ensure her goals of playing basketball at the collegiate level. To finish college and be an asset to our Tribal Community</p>
<p>The goal of this fundraiser is for Tori to be able to travel and play in several Basketball tournaments this spring and summer in order to showcase her skills to NCAA college scouts who would be able to offer her an athletic scholarship.</p>
<p>For Tori to play in all five tournaments will cost about $8,500 before Indiegog and donation collection fees for travel, lodging, food and Team fees.</p>
<p>The costs break down as follows:</p>
<p>Hotel and meals for all 5 tournaments for 4-5 days each is $4,500.<br/>Airfare for Portland, Seattle and San Diego through Southwest Airlines will be about $2,500 depending on when we can buy the flights. Team fees $1,200 (uniforms, travel gear, tournament fees, etc).</p>
<p>If we raise less than the total we are seeking Tori will still attend as many of the tournaments as we can afford. If we raise more than is necessary to attend all five of the tournaments the extra funds will be held in a scholarship found for Tori.</p>
<p>Please help us by making a contribution today, no matter how small, it all helps.</p>
<p><strong>Her is some more information about my daughter:</strong></p>
<p>She is a 4.0 student, an overall of a 3.98. She has dreams and aspirations of becoming a Doctor. She is currently applying for any and all scholarships to assist her in paying for college. She is active in the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) at school, has taken the heaviest coursework as a senior with two independent classes of Physics and Calculus which she’s getting a 4.0 in. She’s studied Spanish since JR High and also knows her Salish Language of her tribe. Victoria is also active in our Tribal Community as she is a part of the Tribal Youth Council, works evenings when she isn’t at practice at the Tribal Youth Center with At-Risk Youth, volunteers with the VFW Post, Head Start Program. Even though she left the Reservation school, this is still her home and interacts with everyone on a daily basis. Never thinking she’s better than anyone, always trying to help anyone in need. As she once put it, I may have worn my non-native shoes off the reservation, but my moccasins always bring me back. She is a huge role model for all here in both academics and sports. She is also a phenomenal X-Country and Track Runner…..3 Sport State Contender for 3 years.</p>
<p><em>Her drive and determination has set standards for many of the young here and off the reservation. Her love for her community, her culture, to prove that all Natives are capable of following and attaining their dreams; a soft-spoken, humble individual with an old soul; she has overcome the obstacles of drugs, alcohol, teenage pregnancy and presented herself as a very respectable young lady.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>RE: Spokane Legacy Elite Basketball Club</em></strong></p>
<p>To Whom This May Concern:</p>
<p>Spokane Legacy Elite Basketball is a non-profit organization that was created to encourage high school athletes to play at the collegiate level.  It was designed for the purpose of promoting current unsigned high school players to colleges and universities throughout the country.</p>
<p>Last year, in Spokane Legacy Elite Basketball’s first year, they promoted four seniors to the college ranks.  Both the Spokane Legacy 15U and Spokane Legacy 18U teams traveled to the following NCAA sanctioned events to gain exposure outside of the Spokane region:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phoenix, Arizona</li>
<li>Yakima, Washington</li>
<li>Portland, Oregon</li>
<li>Seattle, Washington</li>
<li>Las Vegas, Nevada</li>
</ol>
<p>As well as the above mentioned tournaments, Spokane Legacy played in 3 local NCAA sanctioned events in Spokane, Washington. </p>
<p>This spring/summer, Spokane Legacy is planning to attend the same tournaments as in 2012 with the exception of the Las Vegas tournament.  Instead of Las Vegas, the Spokane Legacy Elite Basketball Program is planning to attend San Diego, California to finish up their summer.</p>
<p>Each team consists of a maximum of 12 available spots.  Each of the 12 kids is certified with the NCAA sanction in order to be included in a program at each of the above mentioned tournaments.  At each of the tournaments, college scouts are in attendance and use the booklet in order to learn about the whereabouts of the player(s).  College coaches are, by law, able to recruit during each of those tournaments. </p>
<p><em>Last year, the cost of participation with Spokane Legacy Elite Basketball was $1,175.00/participant.  This cost included the following: team uniform, team practice jersey, team shooting shirt, team travel bag, team warm-up top and bottom, all gym rentals, and all entries into each NCAA sanctioned event. </em></p>
<p>Please help support the individuals in Spokane Elite Basketball.  This program will benefit greatly with the support of local businesses and families.  Without support, it is very difficult for interested college athletes to get an opportunity to play basketball at the collegiate level.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.highwaterline.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">HighWaterLine</a> was a public art project enacted on the streets of New York City in 2007. For 6 months, artist Eve Mosher drew a blue chalk line along the 10' above sea level line throughout Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan as a way to draw attention to climate change issues in NYC. This was an artistic strategy for inviting conversations about climate change in the very neighborhoods that are projected to be impacted by a rise in sea level over the next century and how citizens can participate in addressing lifestyle changes that need to happen now. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The project is an amazing experience in which to participate. Along with the learning gained from the research they will do, participants get a chance to explore their own neighborhoods inviting new ways of being and seeing in an aesthetic presentation on city streets. It is also an opportunity for them to have conversations with neighbors, build community, and bear witness to the potential impacts of each individual. Mosher's own experience creating the project was life-changing, and she wants to be able to share the project with other communities. It is important to the artist that the project be carried out by community members themselves, and not as a solo performance by Mosher. </p>

</h2></div>","Who I am:
My name is Raphael Henrique Buthmann , 17 years old , Brazil - Rio de Janeiro.
I'm a Industrial Designer student at UFRJ-School of Fine Arts and a Hobbie Content Creator for a Game.
What I do:
Since 2008  I have been studying how to render and how to model objects.
I ended up falling for Industrial Design, I studied to pass the exam to college and got the first position. I've always been very dedicated to their studies, because I knew I could not afford a private college. I got a place in the second best college Brazilian Industrial design - UFRJ - School of Fine Arts.
Also, since that time, I am a member of a forum for a game called ""Racer"" and I've been adding content to it.
 Why I need your help:
My course at University doesn't allow me to have a job and I have time only to do my homework. I live with my granparents, because my mother has a psychological disease and not know my father. So I can not afford to buy a new computer. I had a good economical conditions when I bought one , but not anymore.I know the amount of money is a little bit high...but here in Brazil , things are extremely more expensive than on USA. We pay almost 2 times the price of things because of taxes of importations and etc.Without a new computer, I can't continue my render projects and learn new methods/techniques.
What i will do with the money:
I'm going to buy me a new computer and a design table.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><em>My First Pregnancy</em> is an interactive installation based on experiences, awakenings, and challenges of pregnancy depicted through my own experience and 40 weeks of research.  This piece will invite the audience to investigate the daunting challenges of pregnancy on body, mind, and way of life in the spirit of funhouses, amusement rides, science exhibits, and other spectacles of entertainment and wonder. Pregnancy is so common yet so alien and with this piece I intend to shed light on the gravitas of changes taking place each day, week, month, and trimester.  </p>
<p>The structure of the piece consists of two main areas, one is a ""ride"" and the other is a series of interactive stations. <a href=""http://www.eekart.com/myfirstpregnancy/ride.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The ride</a> is much like a dark ride where viewers are taken through spaces with living-breathing animatronics enveloped in projection as they re-enact content based around home videos of my fiancé and I talking about the many events and emotions we went through during my pregnancy. This includes clashes with anti-abortion clinics, searching for health insurance as a pre-existing condition, unemployment, co-habitation, anxieties about diet, weight, health, rushes to the emergency room, the inevitable labor and more. </p>
<p>The interactive ""stations"" are designed after displays in children's science museums and games or booths in amusement parks. <a href=""http://www.eekart.com/myfirstpregnancy/stations.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The stations</a> include magic mirrors where one sees the anatomical changes of pregnancy on their own body, video games challenging the player to know what is safe to eat during pregnancy eat before nausea takes hold, baby developmental stages as fruits and vegetables in jars of goo,and plush pregnant appendages to try on with simulated baby movement reacting to sound and touch. Sources for the stations include The Mayo Clinic Guide to Pregnancy, What to Expect When You’re Expecting, Birthing from Within, Dr. Cecilia Hann of Valencia OBGYN Associates and prenatal courses.</p>
<p>My First Pregnancy is on schedule to be exhibited at The California Institute of the Arts in April 2012. The design of the project is focused on flexibility of the stations and possibly the ride to travel for public outreach education in the hopes that it can further the educational reach about pregnancy to clinics, universities, high schools, and more. It currently is supported by a Calarts Interdisciplinary Grant, Valencia OBGYN Associates, and more.</p>

<h3>The Impact and Influences</h3>
A major conceptual influence for this piece is Mary Kelly’s <em>Post Partum Document</em>, 1973-1978.  Kelly documented in rigorous scientific detail her son’s first five years, the resulting records were then framed and presented in galleries.  I feel this piece was a powerful testament to the amount of work put in as a mother and I want to pursue the prenatal experience with a similar approach.  Although it’s common knowledge that women go through a lot in pregnancy, I want to elaborate on just how much physical change a woman has to endure.  But physical changes are just a part of the transformation, which is why I am combining our own story to exemplify the external through religious, financial, political, and social forces. Other influences from Pop Art, Terry Gilliam, Tony Oursler, Gretchen Hogue, Pippilotti Rist, and Bjorn Melhaus inform the aesthetics and approach. 
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5,000 dollars in order to complete the set design, individual stations and installation costs for the ride/exhibit. We have a few grants from outside sponsors but we need your help! This is a great experience for women and men of all ages in order to educate themselves about the experiences of bringing a baby into this world. </p>

<p>The Temple Panthers Football Organization consists of Over-Looked Athletes (ages 18 &amp; up) with diverse backgrounds and skills that have not the opportunity to compete on the football field since high school and/or College. Some athletes had opportunities but were unsuccessful by losing focus; becoming young Fathers out of high school, some are in Tech Colleges where there’s no Athletic program, also getting involved with law enforcement, abusing drugs and alcohol and poor choices while in college.</p>
<p>The Temple Panthers Organization has set a goal and that is to successfully develop a program where ""Over Looked Athletes"" can get exposure not only in the area of sports, but also in the community arena.  We want these young men to see that they can become successful and productive in their lives as well as communities.</p>
<p>Temple Panthers mentoring, as a team, is effective and our concept is for participants to receive support and advice, and as a result, will support and advice to others. Your contribution will assist Temple Panthers Athletes who desire to share their testimonies on local television.  The hope is to touch the lives of other young athletes who have also been over looked. We have trained volunteer coaches and committed staff waiting to make a difference in individual lives with prevention and developmental family crisis training, Drug and Alcohol, Career/Jobs development, Financial Advice, as well as Spiritual Growth to list a few.</p>
<p><strong>What we need &amp; what you get</strong></p>
<p>The Temple Panthers Organization needs $25,000 dollars to help fund their Over Looked Athletes Mentorship Program.  $5,000 will be applied towards a local TV ad campaign where current athletes will speak to the public telling their own personal story.  Funds raised will be applied toward office space to conduct mentorship classes, Education Counseling, purchasing 20 laptops for job training, recording and duplication equipment to reach top scouts, stadium rental fees for home games, gear for 60 team members, community network for youth programs, youth training camps, advertisement, bus transportation, storage fees, and broadcasting which costs $20k alone.  With these areas in place, Athletes will be encouraged and have a more positive attitude toward pursuing their goals in life.  More importantly, we want to offer a professional environment.</p>
<p>If we're unable to reach our funding goal, we will conjoin with other mentorship programs in the community and continue to raise funds. All funds will be used in a combined effort to improve the program.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We believe this community based mentorship program will keep young athletes off the streets and involved in the community.  Further, our desire is to provide a positive environment encouraging athletes to once again, realize and embrace their dreams of achieving their goals in education and athletics. </p>
<p>During our first year, the Mentorship Program was successful in developing players toward a top college and an Arena League football team. With your contribution, we’ll have more success stories to boast about with the use of television, media and internet.</p>
<p>There is no other sports program in the local area that’s geared towards helping Over Looked Athletes (18 &amp; above) to achieve their educational goals, further develop athletic skills, and provide mentorship.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We need educators, counselors, pro athletes that would be willing to provide advice and guidance to these young athletes.  Also, you are our biggest advertisement – please spread the word about the Over Looked Program to young athletes seeking to succeed.  Your voice helps! </p>

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics knowledge areas are
some of the primary topics of discussion for the United States
Department of Education. In order to compete in an ever-evolving
global society, kids need to be prepared with the right knowledge

skills. Our Summer Technology Enrichment program will help students develop fundamental skills in these fields in an interactive, fun setting! We will offer a series of structured 10 day sessions that will focus on developing base proficiency in the area of computer science using a hands on method. Regardless of what kids ultimately choose to pursue, these skills will be beneficial in the world of tomorrow!<br/></p><p>We
live in the age of technology. With the many technological advances that have taken place over the
years, technical literacy has become of increasing importance. If we encourage the understanding of these skills amongst the
youth, we will equip them with a knowledge base for life.

The
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics knowledge areas are
some of the primary topics of discussion for the United States
Department of Education. In order to compete in an ever-evolving
global society, kids need to be prepared with the right knowledge
base and develop quantitative reasoning
skills. Our Summer Technology Enrichment program will help students develop fundamental skills in these fields in an interactive, fun setting! We will offer a series of structured 10 day sessions that will focus on developing base proficiency in the area of computer science using a hands on method. Regardless of what kids ultimately choose to pursue, these skills will be beneficial in the world of tomorrow!We
live in the age of technology. With the many technological advances that have taken place over the
years, technical literacy has become of increasing importance. If we encourage the understanding of these skills amongst the
youth, we will equip them with a knowledge base for life. 







Ultimately, our goal is to encourage lifetime learners who are excited about math & science while providing a fun and engaging atmosphere. Buffalo STEP will be a bi-weekly 10 day technology and educational urban camp experience that leverages our city's cultural resources to promote education. The camp will be designed for kids, ages 10 to 14, and hosted by Ethan
Redd, the
creator of the video game “8Bit Ninjas” for the OUYA. The
program will feature daily sessions that focus on mathematics,
sciences, and computer programming. Additionally, the camp will include educational field trips and optional quality breakfasts, lunches, and snacks. Each day will begin at 8:30am and end at 4:30pm. The daily schedule will include lessons, activities, tutoring, and games to enforce the subject matter. Participants will have opportunities to work individually and in groups 
while further developing critical thinking and socialization skills while working on projects that illustrate the theoretical concepts at play. On select days, the city will be our campus; participants will visit local cultural institutions to encourage the use of the educational resources that the city has to offer.  Prior to beginning his studies as a Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering major at New York University, Ethan Redd was a home
schooled student with a passion for technology and design. From a young age,
Ethan studied the rudiments of programming, computer science, and computer
generated imaging (CGI) to gain the skills necessary to see his ideas to
fruition. After a year of independent production, he released his debut title ‘8Bit
Ninjas’ on the OUYA platform (Summer 2013), and is
currently in the process of further development and bringing the game to additional
platforms.
As
a video game designer and student, Ethan has experienced the life of being a STEM

<p><i><b>Now for a breakdown
of Buppl’s main features…</b></i></p>
<p>Buppl will use the power of social media to change the
university experience for the better. Sound like fun? Check out the features
this upcoming mobile app will have!</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A GPS-based map chatting system so students can
easily stay connected with each other on campus</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A local university marketplace, where students
can buy and sell products and services among each other</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A tutoring system: every student can tap into
the knowledge of other students by looking for student tutors at the university</p>

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Classes, Events, and other features ensure that

<p>The important thing to emphasize here is that Buppl will provide a 
platform for student connections on a local level. That means that a 
student of UNM will only connect with other students at UNM, students at
 UW will connect with other students at UW, etc. Cool? Cool. </p><b><i>We'll also keep Buppl completely free for students to use, because we know how valuable a quarter can be on laundry day. </i></b>Or when you're starving for a snack out of the vending machine. <br/><p><br/></p><h3>Why Buppl?</h3><p>
</p><p>There currently isn’t any one,
central hub for students of any given university to connect with each
other, collaborate, and sell their products and services to other
students (which would be very useful and beneficial to the university
community as a whole). That’s why we’ve decided to create
something that does exactly this – and we call it Buppl! <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637351/files/20140609184228-IMG_0086.png?1402364548"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>This is Buppl team member David. </b><br/></p><p>Buppl makes it
easier for college students to thrive both academically and socially.
Tutors will be around every corner, ready to help a fellow college
kid in distress, and Buppl’s chat system means that students will
always know what’s going on around them – whether it’s a
demonstration that’s being planned or something less newsworthy. 
</p>
<p>	In short, given that people are
increasingly managing different parts of their lives through online
interfaces, we think that it’s time for those in a university
setting to have the right tools to do this. 
</p>
<br/><p>We will initially
launch Buppl at UNM (and other colleges throughout New Mexico) during
the fall semester of 2014. After we’ve successfully established a
presence in New Mexican institutions of higher learning, we’ll take
Buppl to campuses across the United States – so if you’re
currently a college kid, keep your eyes peeled for Buppl on your
campus because we’ll be heading your way!</p>

The money will also go to our trip to the Me-to-We Windsong Ranch. The ranch has a mission to save the world by empowering youth to make a difference.

It is the longest running sail training program in North America, and recognized as an exceptional program in the international sail training community.

It is the longest running sail training program in North America, and recognized as an exceptional program in the international sail training community. We are dedicated to continuing the mission of empowering, connecting and inspiring youth through our programs aboard the St. Lawrence II, and hope to do so for another 60 years. However, maintaining any vessel, especially a tall ship, comes with a lot of work and significant price tag.This year we are looking to replace our lower masts with some new ones.

In February and March 2015, we engaged the children of the Nahreya
School, with the support of our partners (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CCECS.AUB?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AUB CCECS</a> and <a href=""http://www.kayany-foundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kayany Foundation</a>) in a
series of exercises that aimed at understanding their playing practices and
play spaces. The children, of various age groups, were introduced to the
project and were given the opportunity to communicate what they would hope to
see in a playground through a brainstorming activity and a collage and drawing
session. The first exercise aimed at initiating <b>memories of play spaces</b>, while
the second aimed at visualising the play spaces the children desire; triggering
their <b>creative imagination</b>. The result was a series of artworks; consisting of
a combination of drawing, writing and collage.

would create a <b>positive and long-term impact</b>; which directly informed the
space’s design. The structure of the playground is modular and easily
assembled, disassembled and reassembled so to guarantee the temporality
required for any structure built in Lebanon’s Informal Tented Settlements. The
design can be <b>easily reproduced and adapted</b> to other schools and camp
settlements so to ensure that the local community will be able to recreate this
space without any additional external design input. The playground’s components
are all easily transportable; so they can be moved back to Syria when the war ends and stability returns. The
modules are developed to accommodate a central basketball/football activity
space; where <b>physical education</b> can take place. The modules also contain
swings, climbing walls, a slide and other active spaces; as well as places for
relaxation and teaching. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have studied the <b>recycling and reuse practices</b> within the Telyani Informal Tented settlements in order to inspire the playground's design components. It proves how a person with scarce resources has a creative intuition to generate what he is in need of. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431192055/zrtoc7hjcwrelpqrkvgc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><u><b>Design-Build Workshop</b></u></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will be hosting a <b>design-build workshop</b> during the construction period of the project. This will allow for international participants from various professional backgrounds to work alongside local NGO’s, students and the local community members. This workshop will also allow to share this experience and our work with all the participants; supporting <b>mutual knowledge exchange</b>. The first stage of the workshop will focus on building the structure of the playground and the second stage will focus on the playground components and finishing.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Participatory art
will also be used to engage the children during the erection of the playground and the space will also offer agricultural facilities and educational
zones; fostering a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach. Local

this structure, which will cultivate community solidarity.</p>

given equivalent priority”
(Dattner, 1969)

Hi! We are CatalyticAction, a not-for-profit, design studio that works
internationally; intervening with projects that catalyse change in society.

This project will
see the production of a playground aimed at Syrian refugee children in
Bar Elias, Lebanon; a region which
is now hosting a huge population within informal tented settlements. Following the crisis in
Syria, over 1.1 million refugees have fled to Lebanon; where the UNHCR predicts
that, of these, over 600,000 are children. Despite some international efforts
to deliver shelter, food and medication, there is still not enough done to
tackle the psychological traumas that these children have experienced. We believe that a playground has the power to heal and
help these children cope.Our Values:We are working voluntarily so all the money raised will be invested in the
realisation of the project itself. This project will be a core initiative that will kick-start
further work from our studio and so we have been spreading the word by presenting at several conferences and starting conversations with different organisations about the future of this project. For this
reason your contribution will not just help this project to become reality but
will also catalyse future projects and ensure their success (see a list of our
current project here: www.catalyticaction.org). We plan to deliver this project in August 2015 if we receive the full amount requested. If we do not receive this amount we will seek further funding and deliver the project later in the year.
Participatory Design Approach
The playground has been designed, and will be constructed, with a participatory approach; prioritising children within the process. 
In February and March 2015, we engaged the children of the Nahreya
School, with the support of our partners (AUB CCECS and Kayany Foundation) in a
series of exercises that aimed at understanding their playing practices and
play spaces. The children, of various age groups, were introduced to the
project and were given the opportunity to communicate what they would hope to
see in a playground through a brainstorming activity and a collage and drawing
session. The first exercise aimed at initiating memories of play spaces, while
the second aimed at visualising the play spaces the children desire; triggering
their creative imagination. The result was a series of artworks; consisting of
a combination of drawing, writing and collage. For more information about this see our blog post here: http://www.catalyticaction.org/participatory-exercises-syrian-children/This participatory approach has allowed us to understand what action
would create a positive and long-term impact; which directly informed the
space’s design. The structure of the playground is modular and easily
assembled, disassembled and reassembled so to guarantee the temporality
required for any structure built in Lebanon’s Informal Tented Settlements. The
design can be easily reproduced and adapted to other schools and camp
settlements so to ensure that the local community will be able to recreate this
space without any additional external design input. The playground’s components
are all easily transportable; so they can be moved back to Syria when the war ends and stability returns. The
modules are developed to accommodate a central basketball/football activity
space; where physical education can take place. The modules also contain
swings, climbing walls, a slide and other active spaces; as well as places for
relaxation and teaching. 
We have studied the recycling and reuse practices within the Telyani Informal Tented settlements in order to inspire the playground's design components. It proves how a person with scarce resources has a creative intuition to generate what he is in need of. Design-Build WorkshopWe will be hosting a design-build workshop during the construction period of the project. This will allow for international participants from various professional backgrounds to work alongside local NGO’s, students and the local community members. This workshop will also allow to share this experience and our work with all the participants; supporting mutual knowledge exchange. The first stage of the workshop will focus on building the structure of the playground and the second stage will focus on the playground components and finishing. For further information about these workshops and how to be part of our team, please see the perks and read more info at: http://www.catalyticaction.org/become-a-volunteer/
Participatory art
will also be used to engage the children during the erection of the playground and the space will also offer agricultural facilities and educational
zones; fostering a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach. Local
contractors and residents of the site will be working together to construct
this structure, which will cultivate community solidarity.
Our PartnersThe Community
Development and Projects Unit (CDPu), at the AUB’s (American University of Beirut) Centre of Civic Engagement and Community Service (CCECS) partnered
with KAYANY foundation and the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) to provide
four schools for children in the Beqa’a region. These schools have received
high attendance and are allowing children to continue with their education;
providing hope for their futures. We have partnered with these organisations,
engaged local constructors and families within the informal tented settlements
in order to carry out this project. We are building on the success of these schools and further highlighting the importance of children for the future. 
We are also very
privileged to have partnered with Da Move, a European freestyle group who will
provide training and will perform at the inauguration of the playground. This
is the first project that they are supporting in the Middle East and they are
putting their efforts into helping realise this project. This playground will enable the children to engage in physical and recreation activities, alike those that Da Move practices and perform, and has been finalised following several meeting and discussion about the positive impact it will have for these children. The
performance at the inauguration of the playground will not only be a fantastic
day for the children but an opportunity to raise further awareness with their
international platform. Da Move will also provide few days of training for the
children and the teachers of the school, who will continue to carry out
physical education after this point. 
As well as these
organisations, we are working with experts who have offered their services
pro-bono to ensure that we can complete this project safely and with great
professionalism. The full team of CatalyticAction provide us with invaluable
support and without them the project would not be possible. Read about us here:

“It is in play
that our desire for a perfect world under our complete control is satisfied,
and it is there that all the meanings of play meet ... Play is the
expression of human freedom, and, in a large sense, play is freedom”
(Dattner, 1969)

provide a monetary contribution but you believe in our work, we would be very
grateful if you could share and spread the word about this campaign and about us

<p>My name is Aneil Pokharel. I created this fundraiser to tell the story of sorrowful events that just transpired in Nepal with this 7.9 Magnitude earthquake and millions of Nepali's today are affected by this, thousands dead, injured and homeless. The two
pictures above are my birth-home, among one of the thousands of homes in
Gorkha, Nepal. Close to the epicenter of this earthquake. Utterly destroyed! Completely
uninhabitable. I lived here until I was 7 years old. Most of my early childhood
memories comes from this house and the surrounding village.  Here, I used
to run around and sell grapefruit, a moment a passerby happened to walk by in
the gravel road adjacent to the house. This was a house so many of our family
members (Uncles, sisters, cousins) called home.  She took care of us well.
She stood for 34 years and today she dies. It's certainly very sad!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am quite glad the roof didn't fall! however. If she was
a human then a good CPR would have certainly saved her. I congratulated my dad ""Krishna Pokharel"" for doing a great job building this house with his own hand. This however is a story millions of Nepali's at home and abroad is telling the world since they are all affected.</p>
<p>Like the
Buddha says! All conditioned things are impermanent and attachment to it will
cause suffering and a testament to that are being proven in these sorrowful
events that just transpired in Nepal, with more than 7000 people dead. 1000's of years old precious buildings have been leveled to ground zero, but we will move on. We will galvanize the world community with social network and help rebuild Nepal in decentralized way with local volunteers and local NGO's on the ground. In the future, we
will build better structures that can withstand earthquakes. The villages of
Nepal is truly a wonderful place to live in, sort of like the Heaven on Earth(
...that is if you don't have to work the fields and take care of animals). Once the emergency relief work is satisfactory and is under control we intend to rethink and re-engineer new generation houses for our villages in
Nepal, leveraging tremendous technical and non-technical resources available
via social Networking. Your support  in this aggressive ambition will write the unwritten records in Nepal's history.</p>
<h3>Earlier Emergency relief work</h3>
<div>We were able to raise some funds 2 days after the earthquake on gofundme site and with the help of Dr Bal Sharma, we connected with local volunteers ( Rudra Pokharel, and Indra Bhattarai) and deployed tents and mosquito nets that supported about 30 families in Chhoprak, Gorkha and hundreds of tents were provided in Simpani, Nepal. Our efforts in initially mobilizing local volunteers who are our uncles, cousins and brothers was a tremendous success. Here are some pictures of that relief work that our local volunteers did in Chhoprak last week. These villages are untouched by government and other relief aid centralized organizations such as the Red-Cross among many others. We are sure the donations will come and eventually help rebuild Nepal but at a time of crisis decentralized more boots on the ground is a much better approach to providing emergency relief to affected individuals.  </div>
<div>In addition to this, we have raised money to buy Corrugated Tin for about 30-40 affected families. This work is being coordinated by Hari Pokharel, Rudra Pokharel and our local NGO in Gorkha called ""Goreto"".  In our village districts however we have more than 1000 families who are affected who will need our support.  Monsoon season will hit us in about 2 months when non-stop torrential rain will adversely affect many families, so we decided to spend all the money we had raised about $3500 dollars at this time by focusing on a chhoprak VDC WD# 2 and #3. </div>

<p>How could that be, you might ask?</p>
<p>All public charities must demonstrate that they have the support of the public during their first five years of existence. We are approaching that five year mark.</p>
<p>A donation of even $1 will be very, very helpful to us because it will help us demonstrate that we have general public support.</p>
<p>So, please don't hesitate to make a small donation.</p>

<br/><h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Provide free online access to the highest quality open source middle
			school, high school, and early university level mathematics, science, and
			language arts courses, textbooks, and materials available, for learners around the world.</p>
<hr/>
<br/><h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The primary
				goal of education is the development of responsible, intelligent, compassionate
				world citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High quality educational resources must be available to everyone, everywhere, anytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive standards are important and must be supported 
		with high quality textbooks and multimedia-based presentations and 
		exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all need to not only learn, but learn how to learn, and learn how to teach ourselves anything we deem important to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students learn by hearing, seeing, feeling, thinking, and doing. Instruction needs to be effectively blended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As high quality university level educational resources are made
		 more readily available, the gaps between those who can benefit from 
		such resources and those who cannot will grow, and could become 
		intractable if left effectively unaddressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general public needs a smoother pathway from  primary and 
		secondary school level education all the way up to high quality 
		university level education.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<br/><h3>What We Do
		  </h3>
<p>We are primarily engaged in three activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Developing open educational resources for pre-university and early
				university level learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publishing high quality open educational courses and materials online for free.
			</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curriculum research and development aimed at finding ways to help people not only learn, but 
		learn how to learn.</p>

Who We Are




Friends of Equal Opportunity in Education Forum, Inc. (FEOEF) is a charitable, educational, and scientific tax exempt 
nonprofit corporation founded to help meet the general public’s need for access to affordable high quality educational materials.





Our Mission
Provide free online access to the highest quality open source middle
			school, high school, and early university level mathematics, science, and
			language arts courses, textbooks, and materials available, for learners around the world.

Our Philosophy


The primary
				goal of education is the development of responsible, intelligent, compassionate
				world citizens.


High quality educational resources must be available to everyone, everywhere, anytime.


Comprehensive standards are important and must be supported 
		with high quality textbooks and multimedia-based presentations and 
		exercises.


We all need to not only learn, but learn how to learn, and learn how to teach ourselves anything we deem important to know.


Students learn by hearing, seeing, feeling, thinking, and doing. Instruction needs to be effectively blended.


As high quality university level educational resources are made
		 more readily available, the gaps between those who can benefit from 
		such resources and those who cannot will grow, and could become 
		intractable if left effectively unaddressed.


The general public needs a smoother pathway from  primary and 
		secondary school level education all the way up to high quality 
		university level education.



What We Do
		  
We are primarily engaged in three activities:


Developing open educational resources for pre-university and early
				university level learners.


Publishing high quality open educational courses and materials online for free.
			


Curriculum research and development aimed at finding ways to help people not only learn, but 
		learn how to learn.

FEOEF offers a free open educational portal, The Free Learning Channel,

Provide free access to courses from multiple leading universities and educational institutions.


Embrace an international standards-based approach.


Provide course content broken down into its primary pedagogical elements.


Offer a  truly dynamically-responsive-to-browser-size user experience.



We are pioneers. We conceive and develop open educational 
		resources that are not only loosely coupled and highly cohesive, but we

      Metalwork
      Blockwork
2. Home Economics: Which also involves 
     Life Skills and
     Food and Nutrition (cooking)
3. Visual Arts: Which deals more with art works.All of these aspects involve practical lessons. We are however not able to do these due to the fact that they all have to be done in the open at the mercy of the weather-sometimes rainy, sunny and windy.As a result of this, teachers resort to more theoretical work at the expense of practicals.We strongly believe that a pavilion will go a long way to enhance the teaching and learning of the subject. There would be effective practical lessons which will go a long way to develop and arouse the interest of students who might want to pursue it further.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Where Does All this Money Go?:

In short - we are raising money to help and support Israeli kids with dyslexia and other language based learning difficulties who are currently not adequately receiving the needed support in the regular or special education system.

How?

1) Kol Koreh Consultant - Sending our staff members to schools to educate and provide guidance and support to teachers and children,


2) Kol Koreh Professional Staff - help identity and provide research based intervention to support specific needs of these students


3) Kol Koreh Resource Center - Purchasing equipment and technology, renting classroom in a local community center (no building required for this organizational model!),  bringing in staff for extra curricular activities

Additionally, we want this program to expand so that we can help other cities set this system in place.

</div></div>","Hey, what's the deal with Rock Camp?  Good question! Rock Camp is a supportive place where diverse groups of kids come together to be empowered by creative collaboration through rock 'n roll.
 Our Rock Camps are programs of YEAH!, a 501(c)3 non-profit that has been facilitating music and arts programming for twelve years. Southern Girls Rock 'n Roll Camp, Tennessee Teens Rock Camp (Nashville & Murfreesboro), New York City Rock Camp, and Rock Block (Nashville & Murfreesboro) are all projects of YEAH!. These programs culminate in a showcase where the campers perform the songs they have written in venues like Mercy Lounge in Nashville or The Knitting Factory in Brooklyn! 

We've reached over 3,500 kids and helped them realize that they can do anything they put their minds (and drum sticks!) to. At least 50% of our campers come on full or partial scholarship, and we have NEVER turned a kid away due to lack of funds. Every camper who has ever wanted to attend camp has come, regardless of what they can afford to contribute. 

  What We Need & What You Get

We are reaching out to YOU and asking you to help us raise $5,000 in order to sustain, expand, and market our programming to more and more kids all across Middle Tennessee. We are committed to our Scholarship Program and we need you to help us make it work! We also need to fix and buy equipment for kids to rock on, help bring high-profile speakers and guest bands to open up their world, keep the lights in our office on, provide food and coffee for our amazing volunteers, and so much more!

If you choose to donate, help spread the word on social media by using the hashtag #whyihelpedrockcamp with the reason you donated for a chance to win a Full Camp Scholarship for your camper or another rockin' kid this summer! 
If you donate $100 or more, you will get a special vintage deadstock Rock Camp tee!


  
Other Ways You Can Help

 If you can't give monetarily, don't fret! There are tons of ways to get involved.  
Get the word out! Share this with any and every person online, make some noise about it at the coffee shop or community center, & tell your cat so s/he can spread the word! We rely on word-of-mouth to make our programs happen.

My dear friend Adriana is the Principal of a small school in Tecate called Integral Education School. Adriana is the warmest most caring person I know.  Last year, the kids in her school helped me build a roof for a woman in desperate need of a roof and running water! The kids were amazing! Well, now Adriana's school is growing and we need a roof and another classroom for HER school. <br/></p>
<p>With a degree education Adriana teaches English and French.  ""Our school is the only totally English immersed school in all of Tecate.  We have every opportunity to be aware of the learning process of each one individually. We are a very small school and the children learn at their own pace. It is very individualized program so we teach them one on one.""<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The school desperately needs you your help! Our campaign is to provide some basic things like a roof, another classroom and supplies. Your donation provides shelter from the rain and a safe place in which the students can learn. Your contribution will make a deep and lasting impact in the parents as well,  because they will know that we are investing wisely and into their children and ultimately attract more students to the school .<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need building supplies for paint, wood, stucco, and other building materials.Your dollars go a long way here all of the money will be stretched to the most. If you wish, we will acknowledge you to the class and the students will personally write a thank you letter ! You will have a important part in the children's lives because they will know that somebody cares for their school, thus their education. We have plenty of labor and workers. We just need the materials and that costs money.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>Educated people means a better world. People with values impact the community and the society at large in powerful ways. Our most recent campaign involved a little girl and her Grandmother. As a school we rallied together and built a roof for them, painted the interior of their house and the family enjoyed a dry warm place for the winter. The entire school got involved. Every student felt they had changed the life of a family forever. They are now encouraged to keep on helping. In fact, recently a group of the students asked ""Can we go back? We want to help another house!""<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is no other basic need than food and shelter. You are helping with this need. The child is our future.   Without these things our enrollment suffers and we cannot be as effective.

<p>Hola! Ciao!Hallo!<i> <br/></i></p>
<p>You can also read the text in German if you scroll down.<i><br/></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hello
to everyone around the world! This is an open call to all of you that want to
engage into a common vision coming true: a vision for culture and society
through touristic development. But let’s take it from the beginning: read our
story and who we are. Find out where we are today, how far we are willing to go
and what we dream of reaching… </p>
<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/10420887"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fanis</a>, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/10104322"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eirini</a>,  Alex, Harris and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/10621336"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vassilis</a> and we all come from different backgrounds: arts

powerful experiences and people reaching their full potential through
collaboration. </p>

</div>
<p>We
shared our concerns, experiences and hard-earned knowledge. We talked about
youth unemployment, a fragmented cultural scene in Greece and young performing
artists and graduates from gymnastics schools fighting by themselves to fulfill
their dreams. At the same time, we observed visitors in Greece from all over
the world who look for experiencing something different and unique other than
the beautiful climate and the sea.</p>
<p><b>What if all those people met somewhere in common?</b></p>
<p>For
that, we created “Greek Animators”: a vibrant community of performing artists
of all kinds, traditional or contemporary, local or global, dancers, musicians,
actors, and many more, that aim to offer unforgettable cultural experiences,
such as interactive shows, recreational activities and imaginative performances
for all ages, to travellers, hotel guests and tourists who wish to meet the
true contemporary cultural action in Greece and most of all… enjoy their stay
to the maximum and have lots of fun!</p>
<p><b>Our vision</b></p>
<p>We
envision “Greek Animators” as the National Team for Culture and Tourism. We
reached out and all of a sudden we’ve gathered dozens of people, from street
dancers and musicians to rhythmic gymnastics athletes and theatre groups that
are in fact… forming the largest animators’ community in Greece! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p>Our
community is open, constantly inviting and embracing new people and
collaborations that enlarge its possibilities. We aim to highlight upcoming
cultural groups and all the fresh and evolving talent in Greece. We focus on Greek
history and cultural tradition in our happenings but also combine it with
contemporary international elements that flourish now days in our country. That
way, we promote an authentic view of the newest cultural activity in Greece.</p>
<p><b>Where we are today</b></p>
<p>Today,
we are in the process of forming a Social Cooperative Enterprise in order to be
able to sustain and develop “Greek Animators”, fight youth unemployment in the
sector of performing arts and culture, by developing innovative happenings for
the sector of tourism. Of course, locals are also very welcomed to attend our
events! </p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We
have already found the ideal space to house our offices and the absolutely
necessary trainings, rehearsals and seminars. We’ve started repairing it with
our hands, but we can’t get very far without your support.</p>
<p>Your
contribution to appropriately forming our space and maintaining it for the

<p>Geita is an area which is highly affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and dysentery.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm Baruch and this campaign is intended to raise money for me to buy a beautiful piece of land in Vermont to make a permaculture home for myself and a few friends. This is 15+ acres for $100,000 which includes a structure ready to be made livable. I need $25,000 for the 25% down payment. I have raised $5,000 so far! </p>
<p>The plan for this land is to love it, learn from it, care for it, grow food, be sustainable; to live lightly as we engage in our various occupations, which are focused on making things better for Life on Earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am a person who seeks to do good in the world.  One of my projects is a radio show that I produce/host  called <a href=""http://paradigms.bz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Paradigms"">Paradigms</a>.  It doesn't provide a paycheck but it does reach out to thousands of people around the world with inspiration, ideas, information, and great music.</p>
<p>I offer what I have, my skills and talents, often without financial remuneration.  I am fine with that.  Money is not what's important to me in this life, which is part of why I don't have the money for this down payment in hand myself.  I live as much as I can by sharing.  I share what I have and others share with me.  There are others who will also live on this land who are contributing money, time, effort, for whom this home will also be important.<br/></p>
<p>If we are able to pull this off, it will be yet one more permaculture homestead in the world where cultural creatives are doing their thing.  That's good!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be a home for myself and some other folks.  The plan is to ""permaculture it up!""  This place has so much going for it; southern exposure, water, a pond, a 2-story 2-car garage structure w/a little studio attached, a septic tank, power, open space for gardening and animals, woods for exploring.  It will not take long to get things up and running for energy efficient living, growing food, composting, etc. There will be yurts and a greenhouse in the near future.</p>
<p>This will also be a place where people can come for some peace and quiet, for ceremonies, to have weddings and memorials and other rituals.  We will also make herbal products like salves and tinctures, fabric items like clothes and hand made dolls, and more.</p>
<p>The impact of supporting this project can best be described as many ripples going out into the world from many stones scattered into a pond.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $25,000 for the downpayment.  Contributions of any size will help.  I have raised $5000 so far, $20,000 to go!  The other 75% will be in the form of  owner financing with payments that I can comfortably manage with my current income and rent from other folks who will live on the land. The whole thing is very doable.</p>
<p>As a way to say thank you, everyone who donates $25 or more will get a jar of salve made from the plants of this land. Donors of $100 or more can also elect to receive a Bodywork Session with Baruch.

<h3><b><i>We are heartbroken beyond words to see the continual loss and devastation in Nepal and are grateful to be in a position to help the people of this country.</i></b></h3>
<p><b>Nepal, still reeling from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25, 2015 that killed more than 8,000 and caused over 100 aftershocks - was jolted again from a second earthquake. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thousands of frightened people are sleeping outdoors after this second 7.3 magnitude earthquake killed dozens of people on May 12, 2015. Hundreds of thousands are now homeless; striking the hardest in the foothills of the Himalayas and triggering landslides that blocked roads to remote villages in several districts including the hardest hit Sindhupalchowk region.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>An estimated 2.8 million Nepalese are displaced. The quake leveled entire villages in the upper hills and mountainous regions leaving hundreds of thousands of small farmers homeless.</p>
<p>While information is still coming in about the extent of the damage, officials are learning that thousands of schools have been destroyed and that tens of thousands of classrooms will need replacing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Almost one million children enrolled in school before the earthquake may now find there is no school building to return to,” said Tomoo Hozumi,<a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations_childrens_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>Unicef's representative in Nepal. “Prolonged interruption to education can be devastating for children’s development and future prospects.”</p>
<p>The total cost of repairs is expected to be $6 billion, equivalent to about 30% of Nepal's annual economic output. 100% of funds raised will go to relief and rebuild efforts in Nepal.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Jiwanko Saathiharu means friends of Jeremy and also friends of life (While living in Nepal Jeremy was given the Nepali name, Jiwan, which means “life”). </b></p>
<p>Our Foundation, a US 501(c)(3) non-profit, founded in 2008 after the sudden and unexpected, tragic death of Jeremy Saxe from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Jeremy, an Orange, CT resident and Amity Regional High School graduate, was a senior at Lafayette College and had just returned from a transformational semester abroad in Nepal. He was compelled to return to Nepal and commit his future to education and development work to alleviate the gross disparities he witnessed while he was there.</p>
<p>Nepal’s warm and generous people are rich in culture and spirituality, but impoverished from a lack of quality education, a ten year civil war and political instability. </p>
<p>The JSF Foundation has made 5 trips to Nepal, toured numerous schools and met with many INGOs, NGOS, as well as UNICEF, UNDP and Nepal’s Ministry of Education. Although the needs were great before the earthquake, obstacles we have encountered include corruption and most surprisingly from some, a lack of interest in working toward exceptional education. It has been challenging to find partners in Nepal who share Jeremy’s values.</p>
<p>Although the process has been long, the advantages gained through relationships developed over this period of time have encouraged us to remain committed to our values and our mission. We know it is what Jeremy would have wanted.</p>
<p>An exceptionally bright light amidst our growing relationships has been <a href=""http://www.teachfornepal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Teach for Nepal.</a> Foundation officers spent 3 days with Teach for Nepal in February of 2014; a few pictures are included in the campaign gallery.</p>
<p><b>Teach For Nepal:</b></p>
<p>Teach for Nepal's philosophy to recruit university graduates (most Nepalese teachers have a 10th grade education) and train the Fellows, not just as exceptional teachers, but as change-agents and community leaders, aligning precisely with the values of Jer’s legacy foundation. The Teach for Nepal Fellows commit to two years of teaching at some of the most impoverished schools in Nepal where they homestay in the village. After two years of Fellowship they are expected to emerge as leaders and develop innovative solutions to end education inequity from inside and outside the education system.</p>
<p>Following this disaster, the Teach for Nepal team launched a ""Reach to Relief"" campaign. Through 28 placement schools in Sindupalchowk and Lalitpur, they have been able to reach over 100 communities and initial relief supplies of food, medicine and tents have been delivered. These passionate TFN Fellows reached the most devastated villages after the first quake and in many villages they were the first responders. They are a group who share the Jeremy Saxe Foundation's values and are truly dedicated to ""service above self.” The second phase will be rehabilitation and reconstruction of the schools that were affected.</p>
<p><b>All funds received:</b></p>
<p>All funds received from this campaign will go directly to Teach for Nepal’s “Reach to Relief"" and rebuild campaign.  <b>Please see below to see what is needed now.</b></p>
<p><b>The story that compelled us to launch this campaign:</b></p>
<p>Babita Kushwaha, a Teach for Nepal Fellow working in Sindhupalchowk’s Nawalpur Village, survived the massive earthquake on April 25, 2015. We knew we had to help when we learned she witnessed 40 bodies being pulled from the rubble, including her students and one of her colleagues. We were devastated to hear that no relief was reaching the village.</p>
<p>Read about Babita's impact with Teach for Nepal in the Nepali Times article: <a href=""http://nepalitimes.com/article/nation/young-nepalis-upgrading-quality-of-education,2039"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to the Village</a>; her exceptional leadership enabled the first round of essentials to reach her village - you can see photos in the gallery section of this campaign.</p>

<p><b>What you should know about us:</b></p>
<p>We are a US 501(c)(3) registered non profit Federal EIN # 26-3345574.  JSF employs one person, an In Country Manager who reports to our volunteer In Country Director and Board member in Nepal. His salary is paid through a dedicated grant we received to cover expenses in Nepal. JSF has 9 board members; 2 live in Nepal. </p>
<p>In the United States, the Foundation is an entirely volunteer operation with no overhead expenses incurred and all the Foundation's travel expenses are paid personally by the Saxe family, as well as the processing costs of this campaign. 100% of all donations from this campaign will be received by Teach for Nepal’s program to provide relief and rebuilding in the communities where their Fellows teach and live.

Jeremy, an Orange, CT resident and Amity Regional High School graduate, was a senior at Lafayette College and had just returned from a transformational semester abroad in Nepal. He was compelled to return to Nepal and commit his future to education and development work to alleviate the gross disparities he witnessed while he was there.
Nepal’s warm and generous people are rich in culture and spirituality, but impoverished from a lack of quality education, a ten year civil war and political instability. 
The JSF Foundation has made 5 trips to Nepal, toured numerous schools and met with many INGOs, NGOS, as well as UNICEF, UNDP and Nepal’s Ministry of Education. Although the needs were great before the earthquake, obstacles we have encountered include corruption and most surprisingly from some, a lack of interest in working toward exceptional education. It has been challenging to find partners in Nepal who share Jeremy’s values.
Although the process has been long, the advantages gained through relationships developed over this period of time have encouraged us to remain committed to our values and our mission. We know it is what Jeremy would have wanted.
An exceptionally bright light amidst our growing relationships has been Teach for Nepal. Foundation officers spent 3 days with Teach for Nepal in February of 2014; a few pictures are included in the campaign gallery.
Teach For Nepal:
Teach for Nepal's philosophy to recruit university graduates (most Nepalese teachers have a 10th grade education) and train the Fellows, not just as exceptional teachers, but as change-agents and community leaders, aligning precisely with the values of Jer’s legacy foundation. The Teach for Nepal Fellows commit to two years of teaching at some of the most impoverished schools in Nepal where they homestay in the village. After two years of Fellowship they are expected to emerge as leaders and develop innovative solutions to end education inequity from inside and outside the education system.
Following this disaster, the Teach for Nepal team launched a ""Reach to Relief"" campaign. Through 28 placement schools in Sindupalchowk and Lalitpur, they have been able to reach over 100 communities and initial relief supplies of food, medicine and tents have been delivered. These passionate TFN Fellows reached the most devastated villages after the first quake and in many villages they were the first responders. They are a group who share the Jeremy Saxe Foundation's values and are truly dedicated to ""service above self.” The second phase will be rehabilitation and reconstruction of the schools that were affected.
All funds received:
All funds received from this campaign will go directly to Teach for Nepal’s “Reach to Relief"" and rebuild campaign.  Please see below to see what is needed now.
The story that compelled us to launch this campaign:
Babita Kushwaha, a Teach for Nepal Fellow working in Sindhupalchowk’s Nawalpur Village, survived the massive earthquake on April 25, 2015. We knew we had to help when we learned she witnessed 40 bodies being pulled from the rubble, including her students and one of her colleagues. We were devastated to hear that no relief was reaching the village.
Read about Babita's impact with Teach for Nepal in the Nepali Times article: Back to the Village; her exceptional leadership enabled the first round of essentials to reach her village - you can see photos in the gallery section of this campaign.


What you should know about us:
We are a US 501(c)(3) registered non profit Federal EIN # 26-3345574.  JSF employs one person, an In Country Manager who reports to our volunteer In Country Director and Board member in Nepal. His salary is paid through a dedicated grant we received to cover expenses in Nepal. JSF has 9 board members; 2 live in Nepal. 
In the United States, the Foundation is an entirely volunteer operation with no overhead expenses incurred and all the Foundation's travel expenses are paid personally by the Saxe family, as well as the processing costs of this campaign. 100% of all donations from this campaign will be received by Teach for Nepal’s program to provide relief and rebuilding in the communities where their Fellows teach and live. The foundation also supports an annual scholarship at Amity Regional High School.
How much should you donate? 


Please donate whatever you can; every single dollar makes a difference and be assured that 100% of your donation will reach the 
Nepal Earthquake survivors.


Your contributions and prayers are much appreciated!


With love and gratitude,
Heidi & Tracy Saxe and, of course, Jer : )

Donations are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.
What We Need: 

Increased substantial temporary housing to protect families from the heavy monsoon rains that start in June and continue through August - September
Minimum three month supply of food
Toilets - diarrhea outbreaks are currently happening and the WHO is anticipating a cholera outbreak as well
Temporary schools to keep children safe and provide post- traumatic stress counseling and activities. Nepal schools are scheduled to resume on May 29, 2015
Rebuild of schools

The Impact:
Most relief efforts have been focused in Kathmandu. This will bring relief to under-served communities and villages most severely impacted by the earthquake.


Risks & Challenges:
Damaged roads

<p>I want to thank you for taking the time to look at this
campaign and hope you find it worthy of your consideration.  My name is Lionel Kull and I am one of the
founders of AnswerUS.com.  I am a 60 year
old American who has followed the political antics of our country for
years.  I have chatted with the masses
who all seem to say, ""I wish there was something I could do to influence our
politicians and help our country."" Or I've also heard ""I wish there was something I could do to make my children's future more bright.""</p>
<p>Well
now here  it  is, it’s called</p>

<p>AnswerUS.com is in beta right now and will be open to the
American Public in November.  AnswerUS
will be strongly encouraging student involvement and we will push for all
schools with political science classes to take part.  More on the benefits of this below. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>This Is Who We Are And What We Do</h3>
<p>First off we are nonpartisan and
committed to uniting this country.</p>
<p>There are 537 elected officials who control the lives of 320
million Americans.  On the website we
have prepared an identity page for each official, which will be his platform to
communicate with us.  Each week the
American public will ask our elected officials questions of their concern.  You will either ask a new question or vote up
a question which has already been asked. 
The question with the most backing will become their “Question of the
Week”.  He/She will then be given one
week to answer their question.  When the
question has been answered the public will then come back and rate the answer
for accuracy.  This will give the
official and honesty rating of 1-100. 
During election years we will also have a page set up for the challengers.  All answers will be saved on the official’s
page for posterity and future reference. </p>
<p>Should the official decide not to answer, it will be
highlighted on his/her page that he/she did not answer and a fyi will be sent
out to over one hundred national media sites reporting so.  </p>
<p>The politicians we have contacted so far seem to like the
idea which we are presenting.  Most like
relating to the American people, especially without a microphone or camera
stuck in their face.  Having a week to
answer, making sure what they are saying is right, seems to be a format for
which the time has finally come.  We at
AnswerUs.com feel that this new found cooperation between the American public
and our politicians may take some of the power away from corporations and
special interest groups and give it back to the people.  Maybe congress and the American public will
work together again and their 7% approval rating will rise. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What This Means To Students</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We at AnswerUS.com feel it is imperative to get our younger
generation involved in our government at an early age.  The future of the nation rest on their
shoulders.  AnswerUS.com is not only
about students but also all Americans. 
We are creating an interaction with our politicians which will create
and unfiltered communication tool between we the people and our elected
officials. </p>
<p>AnwserUS can be implemented in the political science classes of the high schools throughout America.  This would be a wonderful education tool.  Students would be asked to bring their individual question to class where it can be discussed along with all other questions.  The class would decide which question is worthy enough to become the question of the week and become submitted to AnswerUS.  As the question  rises in popularity within the national questions, points will be awarded and  accumulated .  The top classes per state and the top 5 per country will be awarded with computers, laptops, Ipads, e books, etc. , which will be presented to the school.  </p>
<p>The students learn in various ways.  They must research current events so as to come up with a question. They participate in a class discussion when grading the classmates questions.  The students will also gather current information from viewing the questions from the American people.  Last but not least they will experience responses from the elected officials.  </p>
<p>AnswerUS.com believes there is a strong disconnect today
between Washington and the American people. 
We believe we own the formula for getting our elected officials to
answer questions that are asked by the American people and the students of our
schools.  It is now time that America
once again becomes a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>As of this date, we are nearing completion of the website and we are in beta testing right now.  We plan on the site going live in November 2014.  None of the founders are coders so we hired a Minneapolis firm to build this site.  We feel they have done a remarkable job and are so looking forward to presenting it the American public.  The estimates to complete the site to live date was $250,000.  The funds provided so far have all been private.  We do however need future funding for our future endeavors to help make the most of this new and exciting venue.  Phase II will include the building of a mobile app and preparing extensively for the 2016 elections.  The Presidential election of 2016 should see exciting changes where we anticipate using AnswerUS.com questions for debates on our platform.  We also envision using only questions asked from the American people on AnswerUS.com instead of media driven questions. <p></p>

<p>•Each week there will be new questions and new answers which will generate interest to continue returning to the site.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><p>The way we see this is the American people need to embrace
this site and spend just a small amount of time each week in the form of either
asking a question or voting up an existing one. 
That’s all that’s really needed. 
If we can get several million people a week to do so we should improve
America for the better.  Special
interests and corporations will have to take a back seat to the American
public.  We feel we owe this to our
children, grandchildren, and to the future of this country.  All we ask of our elected officials is to keep us in the loop
by answering the questions that are on our minds.  In doing so we may once again become a
government of the people, by the people, and for the people.    </p></div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
 At AnswerUS.com we are endeavoring to relate to as many Americans as possible. To address this issue we intend to enroll the assistance of the national and local media, bloggers,
friends, and just a healthy dose of social media.  Most of our time spent over the next 2 months
will be telling the world that we exist and relaying our message to our elected
officials.  With the response we have already received from politicians and individuals, we anticipate the elected
officials will embrace the site as will the American public. We
believe we can provoke a positive change in American politics that will elevate
our system of government to the heights that have been only dreamed of.  We could have the answer to the question that
I have heard so often over my many years, ""What can I do about it?"" </p>
<p>We have come up with the idea, bounced it off of so many
people with so much positive feedback. Is this a political answer which could
change our country? 
With your help, we believe so.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>We fully understand that there will be a huge number of you
reading this that will like and understand what we are doing but don’t have the
money to allocate to the cause.  That’s
perfectly fine but we need to rely on you to help us in other ways.  If you can pass on this information to your
inner circle of friends and relatives, that would be of great assistance!  Bringing forth questions that America needs
answered will be a must do for all of us. 
Our continued contact with our elected officials gives them a platform
to relate to us and the feedback we have desperately been seeking.  Your opportunity is here to finally have your
voice be heard and move America in a positive direction.  That of which is for the people, of the people
and by the people. </p><p></p><h3>Prizes (How they will appear)</h3><b>Bluetooth Speaker- </b><div>

OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE IS IN THE HANDS OF OUR YOUTH







I want to thank you for taking the time to look at this
campaign and hope you find it worthy of your consideration.  My name is Lionel Kull and I am one of the
founders of AnswerUS.com.  I am a 60 year
old American who has followed the political antics of our country for
years.  I have chatted with the masses
who all seem to say, ""I wish there was something I could do to influence our
politicians and help our country."" Or I've also heard ""I wish there was something I could do to make my children's future more bright.""
Well
now here  it  is, it’s called


AnswerUS.com is in beta right now and will be open to the
American Public in November.  AnswerUS
will be strongly encouraging student involvement and we will push for all
schools with political science classes to take part.  More on the benefits of this below. 

This Is Who We Are And What We Do
First off we are nonpartisan and
committed to uniting this country.
There are 537 elected officials who control the lives of 320
million Americans.  On the website we
have prepared an identity page for each official, which will be his platform to
communicate with us.  Each week the
American public will ask our elected officials questions of their concern.  You will either ask a new question or vote up
a question which has already been asked. 
The question with the most backing will become their “Question of the

week to answer their question.  When the
question has been answered the public will then come back and rate the answer
for accuracy.  This will give the
official and honesty rating of 1-100. 
During election years we will also have a page set up for the challengers.  All answers will be saved on the official’s
page for posterity and future reference. 
Should the official decide not to answer, it will be
highlighted on his/her page that he/she did not answer and a fyi will be sent
out to over one hundred national media sites reporting so.  
The politicians we have contacted so far seem to like the
idea which we are presenting.  Most like
relating to the American people, especially without a microphone or camera
stuck in their face.  Having a week to
answer, making sure what they are saying is right, seems to be a format for
which the time has finally come.  We at
AnswerUs.com feel that this new found cooperation between the American public
and our politicians may take some of the power away from corporations and
special interest groups and give it back to the people.  Maybe congress and the American public will
work together again and their 7% approval rating will rise. 

What This Means To Students

We at AnswerUS.com feel it is imperative to get our younger
generation involved in our government at an early age.  The future of the nation rest on their
shoulders.  AnswerUS.com is not only
about students but also all Americans. 
We are creating an interaction with our politicians which will create
and unfiltered communication tool between we the people and our elected
officials. 
AnwserUS can be implemented in the political science classes of the high schools throughout America.  This would be a wonderful education tool.  Students would be asked to bring their individual question to class where it can be discussed along with all other questions.  The class would decide which question is worthy enough to become the question of the week and become submitted to AnswerUS.  As the question  rises in popularity within the national questions, points will be awarded and  accumulated .  The top classes per state and the top 5 per country will be awarded with computers, laptops, Ipads, e books, etc. , which will be presented to the school.  
The students learn in various ways.  They must research current events so as to come up with a question. They participate in a class discussion when grading the classmates questions.  The students will also gather current information from viewing the questions from the American people.  Last but not least they will experience responses from the elected officials.  
AnswerUS.com believes there is a strong disconnect today
between Washington and the American people. 
We believe we own the formula for getting our elected officials to
answer questions that are asked by the American people and the students of our
schools.  It is now time that America
once again becomes a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.
  What We Need & What You Get 
As of this date, we are nearing completion of the website and we are in beta testing right now.  We plan on the site going live in November 2014.  None of the founders are coders so we hired a Minneapolis firm to build this site.  We feel they have done a remarkable job and are so looking forward to presenting it the American public.  The estimates to complete the site to live date was $250,000.  The funds provided so far have all been private.  We do however need future funding for our future endeavors to help make the most of this new and exciting venue.  Phase II will include the building of a mobile app and preparing extensively for the 2016 elections.  The Presidential election of 2016 should see exciting changes where we anticipate using AnswerUS.com questions for debates on our platform.  We also envision using only questions asked from the American people on AnswerUS.com instead of media driven questions.

people with so much positive feedback. Is this a political answer which could
change our country? 
With your help, we believe so.





  Other Ways You Can Help 
We fully understand that there will be a huge number of you
reading this that will like and understand what we are doing but don’t have the
money to allocate to the cause.  That’s
perfectly fine but we need to rely on you to help us in other ways.  If you can pass on this information to your
inner circle of friends and relatives, that would be of great assistance!  Bringing forth questions that America needs
answered will be a must do for all of us. 
Our continued contact with our elected officials gives them a platform
to relate to us and the feedback we have desperately been seeking.  Your opportunity is here to finally have your
voice be heard and move America in a positive direction.  That of which is for the people, of the people
and by the people. Prizes (How they will appear)Bluetooth Speaker-

Summary</b></p>
<p>Every summer, Rocky Ridge Music Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, brings approximately 150
young musicians ages 10-24 to attend our Junior Music Camps and our Young Artist Program.  Many of these students receive
financial aid, but the need is always greater than our resources—and we have to
turn away talented kids whose families cannot afford full
tuition.  This makes everybody very sad,
and this year we are determined to make more scholarship funding available, in
order to bring to camp young musicians who will otherwise not be able to come!  In order to make this happen, we need YOU!</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>Located near
Longs Peak and Rocky Mountain National Park, Rocky Ridge is one of the oldest
residential summer music organizations in the nation. In 1942 Beth Miller Harrod,
a pianist, sought a haven where young musicians would be able to immerse
themselves in musical studies away from the daily distractions. She found that
setting at the foot of Longs Peak, a place of unparalleled beauty.  With the high country as a backdrop, our
campus includes the historic Hewes-Kirkwood Lodge and over 40 other structures
functioning as a performance hall, practice rooms, teaching studios, a
composition lab, and residential cabins. 
In this unique setting, Harrod’s ideal of creating a serene place for an
immersive experience joining music and nature lives on.</p>
<p>Today, our
programs have grown to include virtually all areas of music study in orchestral
instruments, piano, voice, composition, musical theater, and American roots
music.  Our Junior Music Camp (ages
10-15) and Young Artist Program (ages 15-24) comprise the core of our youth
programs.  Lasting from two to five
weeks, respectively, these programs bring young musicians to our mountain
campus for complete immersion in music and nature, and are designed both to
enhance musical skills and to develop creativity, self awareness, and
harmonious relationships.  Students leave
with a great sense of confidence in their musical abilities which spills over into
other areas of their lives, a collection of special memories that they have
created for themselves within a nurturing community, and a network of friends
who share a passion for music that support them long after their summer at
Rocky Ridge is over.</p>
<p><b>Our Goal</b></p>
<p>Why $7,500?  This
amount will allow us to make the following additional scholarships
available:  two $2,000 full Junior
scholarships for low-income students; four $250 partial Junior scholarships;
and five $500 partial Young Artist scholarships.  Qualified students have already applied, and
are waiting for your donation to the scholarship fund.  Summer is right around the corner, and our
students need your help to make this happen quickly!</p>
<p><b>Spread the Word</b></p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute to our scholarship fundraiser,
you can help!  Share this campaign
through social media or email, and help us tap into the power of the crowd . .
. if enough people give a little, together we will achieve a lot!</p><p></p></div>","Short and Sweet

</div>
<div>
<p>There is an ever-growing divide between students that come from affluent schools and schools in inner city communities. With the belief that coding is the new literacy, computer science education is slowly but surely growing in these high schools. Yet, most of the current resources pooling into these schools benefit the students <b>who are already privileged</b>, while the underserved students, the ones who may need it most to finally close the gap or even surge forward, <b>continue to be left behind.</b></p>
<p>These underserved students are the ones who <b>consistently lack access</b> to the enriching summer opportunities that are so critical to their educations. These are the students that we as Camp Sudo hope to teach to view the world through the lenses of computational thinking and problem solving that only coding can create. With programming, we want to <b>close the gap for these students</b> so that they can finally craft their own futures.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone - </p>
<p>This
October, I hope to go on an exchange program to the city of Nice in the south
of France with the rest of my 8<sup>th</sup> grade class. I will be staying for
eleven nights at the home of a French student, who will stay at my house the
following spring. While there I will attend school with my new French friend
and go on some field trips in the area. As you know I’ve been going to a French
school in New Orleans since kindergarten, but this exchange will be the first chance
for me to compare my level in Math, Science, Social Studies, and especially in
French with real French students. It’s a big deal for me and something my
school does every year.</p>
<p>Of
course, I will also visit the beautiful city of Nice and other interesting
sites. I’ve never been to Nice, and I would love to explore this area of France.
I guess I’m excited to visit this region, to attend a school in France, and to
stay with a host family for the first time.  And all without my parents! </p>
<p>The
total cost of this trip to France is $1,800. This amount comes from the
airfare, the field trips, and insurance, mainly (the homestay is free). I'm trying to raise $1,300. Every
year students at my school try to raise money to help pay for this trip. This
year, my school thinks that instead of selling things (candy, etc.) to raise
the money, students should look for sponsors who will make a donation in return
for an awesome handwritten (by me!) postcard from Nice that they will receive
in October.  The idea is to raise this
money by the end of August. So if you can help, then just follow the instructions, don’t forget to include your mailing address (for a postcard), and
thanks for being a sponsor!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Zoë</p>

<p>Women
with disabilities in Laos are often unable to access an education and have very
limited employment opportunities. The Lao Disabled Women’s Development Centre
(LDWDC) tackles this by offering vocational training scholarships for disabled
women and girls from poor backgrounds to study at the Centre. Students train in
either sewing, weaving or handicraft production and after completing their
training they are supported to find employment or start their own business.</p>
<p>The
families of our disabled students cannot afford to pay tuition fees, so the
students who are selected for the program are awarded scholarships that cover
the costs of living and studying at the Centre.</p>

then invest the profits from these products into new materials, kick-starting a
cycle of income generation.</p>

with disabilities in Laos are often unable to access an education and have very
limited employment opportunities. The Lao Disabled Women’s Development Centre
(LDWDC) tackles this by offering vocational training scholarships for disabled
women and girls from poor backgrounds to study at the Centre. Students train in
either sewing, weaving or handicraft production and after completing their
training they are supported to find employment or start their own business.
The
families of our disabled students cannot afford to pay tuition fees, so the
students who are selected for the program are awarded scholarships that cover
the costs of living and studying at the Centre.
Give a young disabled Lao woman a brighter future with a donation to the LDWDC Scholarship FundDonations to the LDWDC Scholarship Fund are pooled and distributed as
needed to cover the costs of the vocational training program. Every cent donated is used to
benefit our disabled students. Your donation can provide:$17 - 1 month of training materials
This
provides consumable items like cotton, fabric and glue as well as supplying
each student with the necessary equipment for their chosen vocation. At the end
of their training students can take this equipment home with them and use it to
start their own small business, enabling them to generate an independent
income.
$39
– Tuition fees for 1 month of vocational training
Students receive
intensive training in either sewing, weaving or handicraft production as well
as being able to choose to study electives including English, computing, and
small business management. This training gives students the skills to earn an
income, enabling them to support themselves and help their family.
$55 – 1 month of
boarding fees for a student at the LDWDC
Our
students come from remote villages all over Laos, but their families cannot
afford to support them to live in the city to attend training. We provide them
with accommodation in our dormitory, healthcare, food, drinking water,
toiletries and pocket money. Living in the dormitory together means the
students can study together and support each other while far away from home.
$70 – Start up
funding to enable a graduate student to open her own small business
Upon
graduation, each of our students receives a small amount of money to use to
start their own small business. Students use this money to purchase fabric and
sewing supplies to make the first products for their new business. They can
then invest the profits from these products into new materials, kick-starting a
cycle of income generation.
$110 - Full Scholarship for 1
month 
This
will cover tuition fees and materials for intensive training in either sewing,
weaving or handicraft production and electives such as English, computing and
small business management as well as providing the student with accommodation,
food, drinking water, toiletries, healthcare and a little bit of pocket money.

I want to thank you all for selecting me for this prestigious scholarship. Being the recipient, I will do everything in my ability to uphold the significance of Michele Savoia's legendary name as I take my steps to graduating and into my career. I aspire to develop my talents and to enhance my skills to master the art of designing to be as inspirational, talented, and successful as Michele Savoia.

It was our understanding that the monetary amount we raised would cover the year for our recipient, but only covered one semester. In the interim, tuition has gone up.
WE have decided to continue funding Ron Ramos for his final and last semester for $6,000 and the balance of $4000 will go to another deserving student in the fall of 2016!

OUR FIRST SAVOIA INDIEGOGO SCHOLARSHIP CAMPAIGN
In February 2014 our dear friend Michele Savoia passed away in a tragic accident on The Hudson River in New York City. Savoia was a MASTER TAILOR of MENSWEAR, and a graduate of Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC. 

We have decided to honor him and create  The Michele Savoia Design Scholarship at Fashion Institute of Technology. Savoia absolutely loved teaching at FIT and we would like to continue his legacy by having a deserving design student have the opportunity for an education in Savoia's name.
OUR GOAL: To raise a minimum of $3,000 with the GOAL of $50,0000 via social media and friends. Every DOLLAR raised (outside of Indiegogo fees) strictly goes to this Scholarship, whether we reach our goal or not. This means if we only raise $1,000, then someone can apply for that $1,000 in his name. 
This is a flexible funding campaign, meaning if you donate, there are no refunds if we don't reach our goal. What happens if we don't reach the minimum goal, is the difference  between 9% or 4% in fees.
Indiegogo Fees: We pay 9% and at the end of the campaign, IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, we ONLY PAY 4%. This is our incentive to reach the goal!

HOW THE SCHOLARSHIP FUND WILL WORK!
There are 2 types of Scholarships:1. Current Use Scholarship: Where all the money is given away. The criteria will be defined as to who would receive the funds, by a committee  staff at FIT.  I requested it to be a design student, whose preference specialty is menswear. FIT currently does not have a separate menswear division, but does have courses. Savoia was in the first menswear class ever offered.
2. Endowment Fund: We would have to raise a minimum of $50,000 and the interest pays the tuition. This goes on in perpetuity, meaning 1 student every year will always receive funds. The more funds, the more scholarships.
Tuition is as follows:
If we raise $50,000 + will get Savoia a lifetime Scholarship in his name. 
THE PERK:  You will receive is the pleasure of knowing you sent a student to college to get an education. There is no better perk then that!

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Complete Selenium WebDriver with Java Bootcamp will be released <strong>in May 2020</strong>. </span></p>
<p>If the stretch goals are met, they will NOT impact the release of the course. Those can be appended to the course after the release. Each stretch goal will be released<strong> approximately 60 days after the release of the course</strong>.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>There are relatively few risks here. I will not be spending your money upfront, so in the very unlikely circumstances that I am unable to complete the course, I will refund everyone.</p>
<p>I also promise to refund anyone their pledge if they do not think the course is fully awesome.</p>
<p>I have created <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1347733257/the-complete-selenium-course-v-20-build-your-frame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">campaigns like this</a> before and have been massively successful. Therefore, with your help, I will do it again.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>Let's crush the goal and reach further. As we raise more money, that will unlock even more features of the course! The more money we can raise, the more amazing tutorials I can add to the course.</p>
<p>Every unlocked Stretch Goal will be released approximately 60 days after the course release.</p>

5. Quarterly webinar with industry expert (1 year of webinars)
Beyond the course, you will get a quarterly webinar to further enhance and grow your skills. I will team up with my top quality instructors to teach you amazing skills that you can't learn anywhere else. I know the leaders in mobile automation, web automation, visual testing, unit testing and so much more. You will get to learn from them in an intimate group setting.
6. Access to our secret FB Community of automation enthusiasts
This is an amazing opportunity to knowledge share with your fellow students. We all know that 2 brains are better than one to problem solve. How about 1,000 brains, or 10,000 brains? Imagine what we can do in test automation.
7. 24 hour SLA for course questions
You will get VIP level treatment and we will answer your course questions within 24 hours. That's an amazing benefit when you consider my courses get ~750 new students per month...

The Impact
 

 
Expected Delivery
 
The Complete Selenium WebDriver with Java Bootcamp will be released in May 2020. 
If the stretch goals are met, they will NOT impact the release of the course. Those can be appended to the course after the release. Each stretch goal will be released approximately 60 days after the release of the course.
 

Risks & Challenges
 
There are relatively few risks here. I will not be spending your money upfront, so in the very unlikely circumstances that I am unable to complete the course, I will refund everyone.
I also promise to refund anyone their pledge if they do not think the course is fully awesome.
I have created campaigns like this before and have been massively successful. Therefore, with your help, I will do it again.
Stretch Goals
Let's crush the goal and reach further. As we raise more money, that will unlock even more features of the course! The more money we can raise, the more amazing tutorials I can add to the course.
Every unlocked Stretch Goal will be released approximately 60 days after the course release.

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.5px Garamond;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">One entire school, located in Pawling, New York, has implemented LVE for more than ten years. The staff and students experience a school culture of peace, caring and respect. Children feel valued and understood; bullying is not part of the culture. Students experience an in increase in creativity, social acumen  and emotional intelligence which supports academic excellence. A K-8 LVE school in Florida became the top seventh school in Florida. The Principal stated, ""There simply is no bullying."" Pre-schools and day care centers in the USA which implement LVE have created a culture of caring and kindness. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.5px Garamond;"">LVE is active internationally. In Iceland, a veteran first-grade teacher reported seeing surprising and dramatic improvements in caring, respect, cooperation, concentration, and learning to read. In Lebanon, second-graders in a classroom at ACS learned conflict resolution so well that they solved all peer conflicts themselves; the teacher reported she is free to teach. For the two years in Thailand, the schools winning the country’s award for the best school in the country, the Royal Reward, were schools implementing LVE. Eighty percent drops in school disciplinary referrals were reported by three primary schools within their first year of implementing LVE as whole schools in Bermuda. In Australia, a secondary-level nine student reported, “It’s not just that I like values classes, I really enjoy them. At the start I was dead against values, I didn’t feel like I got anything out of the class... Then I thought for one lesson I would really contribute. That lesson changed the way I felt about values. I can relate to everything that we talk about. I find myself discovering things about myself that I never knew. Values class is really worthwhile.” In South Africa, formerly violent secondary students led LVE workshops for their peers.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful results with LVE’s at-risk materials. In Thailand, one year after implementing LVEP, nine out of 24 refugee-camp teachers working with children and youth reported 100-percent improvement in violent behavior; the others cited an 80- percent reduction in aggressiveness. With children in difficult circumstances, street educators using Living Values Activities for Street Children in Vietnam reported considerable decreases in aggression and at-risk behaviors. They noted, “Now they are confident and friendly with adults and their peers. There is almost no conflict in the classes and they now do not get into trouble after school either. The students have also developed many skits on how to keep safe from dangerous adults and really enjoy performing them. Now when they are on the streets and see children that are new to the streets they give support and advice to the new children and invite them to meet their teacher and join their classes.” The Ministry of Labor in Vietnam reported in March of 2008 that LVE’s program for Drug Rehabilitation was the most successful program in government drug rehabilitation clinics.</p>

 Living Values Educational Program is unusually comprehensive. It offers both methodology and content. Educators teach values through modeling and facilitating a values-exploration process that motivates a bully free environment. LVE provides educator training and hundreds of lessons that build skills sequentially. LVE invites educators to explore this method of values education and then create their own activities and draw from the culture of the students.  Its multi-modality approach contributes to impacting both left- and right-brain thinkers. Not just a “values awareness” approach, LVE educators and activities encourage students to reflect and think deeply in order to engage the heart as well as the mind.
LVE educators reinforce positive character traits and emotional intelligence in all students. One key to LVE effectiveness is the lack of moralizing. “Resistant” students or marginalized youth turn away from a moralizing approach to character education.
What types of activities are included in LVE?
LVE provides a broad range of activities to encourage the development of both cognitive and affective skills. Students are engaged in conflict-resolution exercises, discussions, artistic activities (art, dramas, song, dance, and storytelling), games, communication exercises, role- playing, mind-mapping, creative writing, imagining and relaxation/focusing exercises. For older students, some activities foster awareness of social justice and responsibility. Each site implementing LVE is encouraged to include stories, songs and activities from the culture of the students with whom they work.
Why “living” values?
History is built around the gap between what people say and what they do. LVE believes that adults are important role models. We encourage school development plans that identify values held in common.
What specific values are you looking to promote?
LVE helps people explore and choose their own personal values as well as develop intrapersonal and interpersonal skills to “live” those values. The purpose of this education is to awaken what already exists and provide tools to understand the ramifications of actions for the self, others and society and increase values-based decision-making ability. LVE activities elicit from students ideas about what they would value in their ideal world, and students explore the things they feel give meaning to their lives.
The twelve values explored by LVE have been articulated and widely endorsed around the world at conferences such as the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1992 Aspen Conference.
What do you do during LVE Workshops?
During LVE workshops, educators participate in values-awareness sessions. They are asked to reflect on their own values, imagine an optimal learning environment, and brainstorm quality teaching practices that would create a values-based atmosphere. LVE’s theoretical model and schematic of how values are developed are shared. This is followed by sessions engaged in Living Values Activities. The workshop then turns to skills for creating a values-based environment: acknowledgment, encouragement, and positively building behaviors; active listening; conflict resolution; collaborative rule making, and values-based discipline. Educators who work with children at risk undergo additional training as do facilitators for Living Values Parent Groups.

Funding will be allocated as follows :




Transform schools by training entire staffs of teachers in the Living Values Education methodology (Mindfulness, values exploration and development, active listening, solution-based-thinking and conflict resolution).
Art supplies and materials required to facilitate experiential activities in the Living Values Education curriculum.
Make available the Living Values Education At-Risk curriculum to educators in need of additional training.
Sustainability training using the Living Green Values curriculum.
In appreciate for your generosity you will receive a token of our appreciation, please check the perks section.  



   
Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal
All funds received will be utilized towards training as many teachers in the Living Values Education methodology and supply the necessary materials for the experiential activities in the classroom.
The Impact
One entire school, located in Pawling, New York, has implemented LVE for more than ten years. The staff and students experience a school culture of peace, caring and respect. Children feel valued and understood; bullying is not part of the culture. Students experience an in increase in creativity, social acumen  and emotional intelligence which supports academic excellence. A K-8 LVE school in Florida became the top seventh school in Florida. The Principal stated, ""There simply is no bullying."" Pre-schools and day care centers in the USA which implement LVE have created a culture of caring and kindness. 
LVE is active internationally. In Iceland, a veteran first-grade teacher reported seeing surprising and dramatic improvements in caring, respect, cooperation, concentration, and learning to read. In Lebanon, second-graders in a classroom at ACS learned conflict resolution so well that they solved all peer conflicts themselves; the teacher reported she is free to teach. For the two years in Thailand, the schools winning the country’s award for the best school in the country, the Royal Reward, were schools implementing LVE. Eighty percent drops in school disciplinary referrals were reported by three primary schools within their first year of implementing LVE as whole schools in Bermuda. In Australia, a secondary-level nine student reported, “It’s not just that I like values classes, I really enjoy them. At the start I was dead against values, I didn’t feel like I got anything out of the class... Then I thought for one lesson I would really contribute. That lesson changed the way I felt about values. I can relate to everything that we talk about. I find myself discovering things about myself that I never knew. Values class is really worthwhile.” In South Africa, formerly violent secondary students led LVE workshops for their peers.
There are many wonderful results with LVE’s at-risk materials. In Thailand, one year after implementing LVEP, nine out of 24 refugee-camp teachers working with children and youth reported 100-percent improvement in violent behavior; the others cited an 80- percent reduction in aggressiveness. With children in difficult circumstances, street educators using Living Values Activities for Street Children in Vietnam reported considerable decreases in aggression and at-risk behaviors. They noted, “Now they are confident and friendly with adults and their peers. There is almost no conflict in the classes and they now do not get into trouble after school either. The students have also developed many skits on how to keep safe from dangerous adults and really enjoy performing them. Now when they are on the streets and see children that are new to the streets they give support and advice to the new children and invite them to meet their teacher and join their classes.” The Ministry of Labor in Vietnam reported in March of 2008 that LVE’s program for Drug Rehabilitation was the most successful program in government drug rehabilitation clinics.

<p class=""p2""><br/><em>(<span class=""hps"">Versión en español</span> <span class=""hps"">a continuación)</span></em></p>
<p class=""p3"">Mission Chocó is a social project, an entrepreneurial project, a creative project and first and foremost a humanitarian project. It's a co-creation, an collaboration between dislocated families of Colombia, employees of the social business Maria Panela and a group of students from a creative business school in Denmark called the KaosPilots.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>THE BACKGROUND</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2""> The department of Chocó is one of the most complex areas of Colombia. Located in the northwest, it borders Panama and has coastlines on both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Most of Chocó is low-lying tropical rain forest (one of the rainiest spots in the world), though in the south and the east it starts to rise in the mountains. It is a natural paradise, home to a huge diversity of plant and animal species.<span class=""s1"">  </span>The area is rich of natural resources and a home to thousands of Afro-American and indigenous families, through all racial mixtures, and unlimited cultural views and ancestral traditions.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Sadly, its natural wealth and the low government presence, created the suitable conditions to the creation of drug-runners, both in terms of production and transportation to the coast which has attracted armed groups directly and affected the population, generating a high rate of forced displacement that not only affects quality of people’s life, but jeopardizes the intangible heritage of humanity in terms of language and culture.</p>
<p class=""p2"">In the region the access to education is not easy, either by distance, infrastructure, poor levels of technology or lack of teachers, all of the above triggers in poor academic performance of students which places them in the bottom of the educational scale in the country.</p>
<p class=""p2""> The economic of the region is primarily focused on the extraction of natural resources that makes the employment options very limited.</p>
<p class=""p2"">This naturally leads to a shared idea in the society that the capital offers employment and educational opportunities that do not exist in Chocó. However the reality is that when the families reach the city the dreams and hopes of finding a job fades a way quite fast. On top of that the educational system is not free or always easy to start immediately and unlike the green jungle where food grows everywhere the city in only a jungle of concrete </p>
<p class=""p2"">Despite social and governmental initiatives, conditions in both the region and the city have not improved significantly. In our opinion one of the reasons are that the initiatives have been in the form of aid and have created learned helplessness and dependency rather then strengthening the community.</p>
<p class=""p2""> One of our closes examples is the group that we will cooperate with in this project, the Waunnan’s. They are an indigenous family that came to the city over nine years ago but still haven’t manage to find a sustainable way to get an income for a respectable life. They are dependent on selling their handcrafts that generates revenue of about 200.000 pesos (113 US$) for a family of at least four members. This is not an income they can rely on being constant. It makes them very dependant on support from the government as well as non-governmental aid that is very time consuming.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">Mission Choco is a project led by Maria Panela organization and supported by a group of the KaosPilots‘s students. It seeks to directly benefit the indigenous family Waunnan with job options. Alongside this project, we will make a pilot projects of community strengthening with two more groups, through training and the development of a community plan. </p>
<p class=""p2"">The focus of the project is to build the Innovation Café: María Panela Chocó that requires $ 40,000 to build the café and get it running.<span class=""s2""> </span> This coffee will have three main objectives:</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h3 class=""p2"">What?</h3>
<p class=""p2""> <strong>1.</strong><span class=""s3"">    </span>To promote the Choco region by showing it’s beauty, natural and cultural wealth as well as their needs. Bringing awareness to the possibilities and resources to create a sustainable and helpful development for the families instead of a dependant and short-term assistance. </p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>2.</strong><span class=""s3"">    </span>To generate income for the community by sales platform for Chocó’s communities. It will be run according to the Maria Panela fair trade model where they can start selling their beautiful handcrafts and show what is behind each of their products, that is not mere commodities but a piece of art. The café will be staffed with members of the indigenous community of the Waunnan’s, creating good jobs and steady income and in that way it will contribute to the improvement of the quality of their life in the city. The café will serve as a place for them and the other Chocó communities to preserve their traditions and culture through performances, handcraft workshops, food and other activities. </p>
<p class=""p5""><strong><span class=""s4"">3.</span></strong><span class=""s5""><strong> </strong>   </span>To strengthen communities with everything mentioned above as well as reinvesting 70% of the Café’s profit into further work and processes with families from the Chocó region. Maria Panela will also facilitate work spaces where the families can receive training and advisory for their projects.</p>
<p class=""p6""> </p>
<h3 class=""p2""> How?</h3>
<p class=""p2"">The social processes with the families will be split down to five phases, each phase lasting one year:</p>
<p class=""p4"">1.<span class=""s3"">    </span><strong>CONSCIOUSNESS:</strong> The aim is for the group to unlearn the helplessness of a life dependent on aid and embody new ways of social innovation and community development. </p>
<p class=""p4"">2.<span class=""s3"">    </span><strong>TRAINING:</strong> They will acquire skills that support them in adapting into the city life, the labor market and in the generation of sustainable businesses and organizations.</p>
<p class=""p4"">3.<span class=""s3"">    </span><strong>LIFE PLAN: </strong>Based on the training phase they will now start building life plans: viable and sustainable, they also allow each individual to be part of the Community Living Plan. In this way, it is intended that all community members are competent to take on life and together sustain and preserve their heritage and create decent living conditions for themselves</p>
<p class=""p4"">4.<span class=""s3"">    </span><strong> SUPPORT:</strong> The community will have the permanent support of María Panela’s team to start their life plan.</p>
<p class=""p4"">5.<span class=""s3"">    </span><strong>CONSULTING:</strong> We support specific issues that the community requires and will monitor their achievements.</p>
<p class=""p2"">From the fifth year, community groups begin to be more independent and only receive support in the form of specific advices. Their connection to the project will though stay strong as once each group completes the process of the five phases they are a part of supporting a new group starting on the plan. This will generate more dynamic project and greater the impact!</p>
<p class=""p2"">María Panela has the experience of starting up innovation Café´s that are built on values of fair trade and community impact. The Maria Panela team furthermore has an extensive knowledge and background in working with community development and education. We therefore believe all this will together create a strong foundation to build our project on. </p>
<p class=""p2"">The group is already working on different approaches to reach its goal and all contributions count! We will need 40.000 dollars to be able to invest in a location, to get the interior, the machinery and utensils to be able to open the café for the public as soon as possible.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We have a unique opportunity to celebrate and thank the supporters of the project since our resources within art and culture as well as social business are quite big. Not to forget the café itself and all the possibilities the projects holds. Please take a look at our profits on the right side and see how well can contribute to our project.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Our goal is set to flexible since we will continue to fund raise the money with other methods if we can't reach our goal. We really do hope though that the café can come to reality by the amazing concept that crowd funding is! </p>
<p class=""p2"">All contributions to the project will go on supporting the families of Choco!</p>
<p class=""p2"">If you can't support us with money but would like to help please share our project and story with as many as possible! We highly appreciate it!</p>

<h2 align=""center""><strong>MISIÓN CHOCÓ</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Misión Chocó es un proyecto social, empresarial, creativo, pero sobre todo humanitario.  Es una co-creación, una colaboración entre familias que enfrentan la situación de desplazamiento en Colombia, los empleados de la empresa social María Panela y un grupo de estudiantes de una escuela de negocios creativos en Dinamarca llamada KaosPilots.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>El Contexto</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/> El departamento del Chocó es una de las zonas más complejas de Colombia.  Situado en el noroeste del país, limita con Panamá y tiene costas sobre el Caribe y el Pacífico. La mayoría de Chocó es de baja altitud bosque húmedo tropical (es uno de los lugares más lluviosos del mundo), aunque en el sur y en el este comienza a subir en las montañas.  Es un paraíso natural, en el cual habitan una gran diversidad de especies vegetales y animales.  La zona es rica en recursos naturales y hogar de miles de familias afroamericanas e indígenas, pasando por todas las mezclas raciales, y un sin límite de miradas culturales y tradiciones ancestrales.</p>
<p>Irónicamente, su riqueza natural y la baja presencia gubernamental, generó las condiciones propicias para la creación de corredores de drogas, tanto en términos de producción como de transporte hacia las costas que ha atraído grupos armados y afectado directamente a la población, generando un alto índice de desplazamiento forzado que no sólo afecta la calidad de vida de las personas, sino pone en riesgo el patrimonio inmaterial de la humanidad en términos de lenguas y cultura.</p>
<p>En la zona el acceso a la educación no es fácil, sea por distancia, infraestructura, bajos niveles de tecnología o insuficiencia en la planta docente; todo lo anterior desencadena en pobres resultados académicos de los estudiantes, colocándolos en el nivel más bajo de la escala educativa en el país.  </p>
<p>De otro lado, lo económico gira en torno a una extracción primaria de recursos naturales que generan limitadas opciones de trabajo. </p>
<p>Todo lo anterior es un caldo de cultivo que desemboca en el  imaginario de que la capital ofrece oportunidades de trabajo y educación que no se ofrecen en el Chocó. Sin embargo, al llegar a la ciudad el sueño se desvanece pues conseguir empleo es difícil, la incorporación al sistema educativo no es inmediata ni gratuita, y no existe como en la selva la opción de alimentación a través del pan coger, llegan a una selva de cemento que no produce alimentos.</p>
<p>Pese a diversas iniciativas sociales y gubernamentales, las condiciones tanto en el departamento como en la ciudad no han mejorado notablemente.  Nuestra perspectiva sugiere que una de las razones es que la mayoría de apoyos han sido asistencialistas y generan dependencia en lugar de fortalecimiento comunitario.</p>
<p>Uno de los ejemplos cercanos es el grupo con el que pilotearemos nuestra iniciativa:  la familia indígena Waunnan:  Llegó a la ciudad hace más de nueve años y aún no consiguen sostenibilidad ni acceso a una vida digna.  Dependen de la venta de sus artesanías lo cual genera ingresos aproximados de $200.000 por familia de mínimo cuatro miembros, que no entran ni siquiera de manera constante.  Eso los hace dependientes a subsidios y ayudas gubernamentales y no gubernamentales que requieren una alta inversión de tiempo.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>El Proyecto</strong></h3>
<p>Misión Chocó es un proyecto liderado por la organización María Panela con el apoyo de un grupo de estudiantes de KaosPilots,  que busca beneficiar directamente a la familia indígena Waunnan con opciones de trabajo.  Junto a este proyecto, se piloteará en dos grupos más, el fortalecimiento comunitario a través de la formación y desarrollo de un plan comunitario. </p>
<p><br/> El centro del proyecto consiste en generar el Café de Innovación María Panela Chocó que requiere de 40.000 dólares para su montaje y puesta en marcha.  Este café tendrá tres objetivos centrales:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<span>¿Qué?</span> </h3>
<ol>
<li>Promover la región del Chocó mostrando su belleza, riqueza natural y cultural, así como sus necesidades.  Sensibilizando así a la población hacia la movilización de recursos a la zona no de manera asistencialista sino con el objetivo de generar desarrollo humano armónico y sostenible a largo plazo.<br/> </li>
<li>Generar ingresos para la comunidad siendo vitrina comercial de las comunidades Chocoanas.   Lo anterior operando bajo el modelo de comercio justo para poner en venta sus hermosas artesanías y mostrar lo que hay detrás de cada uno de sus productos, así que no serán simples productos sino obras de arte con poder de transformación.  El lugar, será atendido por miembros de la comunidad indígena Waunnan, buscando con ello contribuir al mejoramiento de su calidad de vida en la ciudad, con un empleo digno que genere ingresos constantes.  Esta y otras comunidades del Chocó harán presentaciones culturales, talleres de artesanías, de comidas y de todo aquello que contribuye al rescate de las tradiciones, la cultura y las lenguas ancestrales, buscando con ello impactar positivamente en los espacios y grupos urbanos.<br/> </li>
<li>Fortalecer a las comunidades a través de la generación de espacios de trabajo y la reinversión del 70% de la utilidad del Café de Innovación en dichos procesos, así como  facilitar espacios de trabajo para los grupos comunitarios en la ciudad en dónde recibirán capacitación y asesoría para sus proyectos.</li>
</ol><h3>
<span class=""hps"">¿Cómo</span><span>?</span> </h3>
<p>El trabajo social que se deriva de este proceso se realizará con cada grupo en cinco fases, cada una con duración de un año:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Concienciación</strong>: Se desaprenderán las viejas maneras asistencialistas de buscar ayuda y se construirán nuevas formas de innovación social para el desarrollo comunitario, siendo consientes que si bien las condiciones de entorno y raza no dependen de nosotros sí lo que hagamos con ellas y nuestro destino.</li>
<li>
<strong>Capacitación</strong>: Se adquirirán competencias que permitan la adaptación a la ciudad, la inserción en el mercado laboral y la generación de empresas u organizaciones sostenibles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plan de vida</strong>: Una vez aprobada la fase de capacitación se buscará la construcción de planes de vida: viables y sustentables, que además, permitan a cada individuo ser arte y parte del Plan de Vida Comunitario.  De esta manera se pretende que todos los miembros de la comunidad sean competentes para asumir la vida y juntos rescaten, mantengan y posicionen el legado inmaterial que traen de sus ancestros, dentro de unas condiciones de vida dignas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Soporte</strong>: La comunidad tendrá el acompañamiento permanente del equipo María Panela para poner en marcha su plan de vida.</li>
<li>
<strong>Asesoría</strong>: Se apoyarán temas puntuales que requiera la comunidad y se realizará seguimiento de sus logros.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>A partir del quinto año los grupos comunitarios empezarán a ser independientes y obtendrán asesorías puntuales cuando lo requieran, pero no un apoyo permanente.  Su vinculo se mantendrá activo cambiando hacia el liderazgo puesto que una vez un grupo completa su proceso (cinco fases) apadrina a otro grupo en su dinámica para generar mayor impacto y fortalecimiento.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>María Panela cuenta con la experiencia en el montaje de Cafés de Innovación, compartiendo los mismos valores de comercio justo e impacto comunitario; y el equipo de proyección social cuenta con amplia experiencia en el desarrollo comunitario y educación, lo cual genera una mezcla ganadora para nuestro proyecto. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Su apoyo!</strong></p>
<p><br/> El equipo se encuentra trabajando en diferentes enfoques para llegar a la meta y todas las contribuciones cuentan!.  Necesitamos 40.000 dólares para poder invertir en la adecuación de un lugar, la maquinaria y utensilios para que el Café pueda entrar a operar lo antes posible.</p>
<p><br/> Tenemos una oportunidad única para celebrar y agradecer a los patrocinadores del proyecto, ya que nuestros recursos tanto en el arte y la cultura, como en nuestro modelo social son bastante grandes.  Tenemos para esto diversas opciones, pues cada donante, de acuerdo al monto, puede tener: su nombre en los diversos espacios del café, postales y artesanías que tendrá como recuerdo. Por favor, eche un vistazo a nuestros beneficios en el lado derecho y así también vea cuánto pueden contribuir a nuestro proyecto.</p>
<p>Nuestra meta es flexible, ya que vamos a seguir recaudando fondos con otros métodos, si no podemos alcanzar nuestra meta.  Realmente esperamos que a través de hacer realidad el Café de Innovación podamos mostrar el asombroso concepto que es el financiamiento solidario!</p>
<p><br/> Todas las ayudas sobre la meta fijada van a entrar en el apoyo a las familias del Chocó!<br/><br/> Si usted no nos puede apoyar con dinero, pero le gustaría ayudar por favor, comparta nuestro proyecto y la historia con el mayor número de personas posible. ! Realmente lo apreciamos!</p>

 El departamento del Chocó es una de las zonas más complejas de Colombia.  Situado en el noroeste del país, limita con Panamá y tiene costas sobre el Caribe y el Pacífico. La mayoría de Chocó es de baja altitud bosque húmedo tropical (es uno de los lugares más lluviosos del mundo), aunque en el sur y en el este comienza a subir en las montañas.  Es un paraíso natural, en el cual habitan una gran diversidad de especies vegetales y animales.  La zona es rica en recursos naturales y hogar de miles de familias afroamericanas e indígenas, pasando por todas las mezclas raciales, y un sin límite de miradas culturales y tradiciones ancestrales.
Irónicamente, su riqueza natural y la baja presencia gubernamental, generó las condiciones propicias para la creación de corredores de drogas, tanto en términos de producción como de transporte hacia las costas que ha atraído grupos armados y afectado directamente a la población, generando un alto índice de desplazamiento forzado que no sólo afecta la calidad de vida de las personas, sino pone en riesgo el patrimonio inmaterial de la humanidad en términos de lenguas y cultura.
En la zona el acceso a la educación no es fácil, sea por distancia, infraestructura, bajos niveles de tecnología o insuficiencia en la planta docente; todo lo anterior desencadena en pobres resultados académicos de los estudiantes, colocándolos en el nivel más bajo de la escala educativa en el país.  
De otro lado, lo económico gira en torno a una extracción primaria de recursos naturales que generan limitadas opciones de trabajo. 
Todo lo anterior es un caldo de cultivo que desemboca en el  imaginario de que la capital ofrece oportunidades de trabajo y educación que no se ofrecen en el Chocó. Sin embargo, al llegar a la ciudad el sueño se desvanece pues conseguir empleo es difícil, la incorporación al sistema educativo no es inmediata ni gratuita, y no existe como en la selva la opción de alimentación a través del pan coger, llegan a una selva de cemento que no produce alimentos.
Pese a diversas iniciativas sociales y gubernamentales, las condiciones tanto en el departamento como en la ciudad no han mejorado notablemente.  Nuestra perspectiva sugiere que una de las razones es que la mayoría de apoyos han sido asistencialistas y generan dependencia en lugar de fortalecimiento comunitario.
Uno de los ejemplos cercanos es el grupo con el que pilotearemos nuestra iniciativa:  la familia indígena Waunnan:  Llegó a la ciudad hace más de nueve años y aún no consiguen sostenibilidad ni acceso a una vida digna.  Dependen de la venta de sus artesanías lo cual genera ingresos aproximados de $200.000 por familia de mínimo cuatro miembros, que no entran ni siquiera de manera constante.  Eso los hace dependientes a subsidios y ayudas gubernamentales y no gubernamentales que requieren una alta inversión de tiempo.
 
El Proyecto
Misión Chocó es un proyecto liderado por la organización María Panela con el apoyo de un grupo de estudiantes de KaosPilots,  que busca beneficiar directamente a la familia indígena Waunnan con opciones de trabajo.  Junto a este proyecto, se piloteará en dos grupos más, el fortalecimiento comunitario a través de la formación y desarrollo de un plan comunitario. 
 El centro del proyecto consiste en generar el Café de Innovación María Panela Chocó que requiere de 40.000 dólares para su montaje y puesta en marcha.  Este café tendrá tres objetivos centrales:
 

¿Qué? 

Promover la región del Chocó mostrando su belleza, riqueza natural y cultural, así como sus necesidades.  Sensibilizando así a la población hacia la movilización de recursos a la zona no de manera asistencialista sino con el objetivo de generar desarrollo humano armónico y sostenible a largo plazo. 
Generar ingresos para la comunidad siendo vitrina comercial de las comunidades Chocoanas.   Lo anterior operando bajo el modelo de comercio justo para poner en venta sus hermosas artesanías y mostrar lo que hay detrás de cada uno de sus productos, así que no serán simples productos sino obras de arte con poder de transformación.  El lugar, será atendido por miembros de la comunidad indígena Waunnan, buscando con ello contribuir al mejoramiento de su calidad de vida en la ciudad, con un empleo digno que genere ingresos constantes.  Esta y otras comunidades del Chocó harán presentaciones culturales, talleres de artesanías, de comidas y de todo aquello que contribuye al rescate de las tradiciones, la cultura y las lenguas ancestrales, buscando con ello impactar positivamente en los espacios y grupos urbanos. 
Fortalecer a las comunidades a través de la generación de espacios de trabajo y la reinversión del 70% de la utilidad del Café de Innovación en dichos procesos, así como  facilitar espacios de trabajo para los grupos comunitarios en la ciudad en dónde recibirán capacitación y asesoría para sus proyectos.

¿Cómo? 
El trabajo social que se deriva de este proceso se realizará con cada grupo en cinco fases, cada una con duración de un año:


Concienciación: Se desaprenderán las viejas maneras asistencialistas de buscar ayuda y se construirán nuevas formas de innovación social para el desarrollo comunitario, siendo consientes que si bien las condiciones de entorno y raza no dependen de nosotros sí lo que hagamos con ellas y nuestro destino.

Capacitación: Se adquirirán competencias que permitan la adaptación a la ciudad, la inserción en el mercado laboral y la generación de empresas u organizaciones sostenibles.

Plan de vida: Una vez aprobada la fase de capacitación se buscará la construcción de planes de vida: viables y sustentables, que además, permitan a cada individuo ser arte y parte del Plan de Vida Comunitario.  De esta manera se pretende que todos los miembros de la comunidad sean competentes para asumir la vida y juntos rescaten, mantengan y posicionen el legado inmaterial que traen de sus ancestros, dentro de unas condiciones de vida dignas.

Soporte: La comunidad tendrá el acompañamiento permanente del equipo María Panela para poner en marcha su plan de vida.

Asesoría: Se apoyarán temas puntuales que requiera la comunidad y se realizará seguimiento de sus logros.
 
A partir del quinto año los grupos comunitarios empezarán a ser independientes y obtendrán asesorías puntuales cuando lo requieran, pero no un apoyo permanente.  Su vinculo se mantendrá activo cambiando hacia el liderazgo puesto que una vez un grupo completa su proceso (cinco fases) apadrina a otro grupo en su dinámica para generar mayor impacto y fortalecimiento.
 
María Panela cuenta con la experiencia en el montaje de Cafés de Innovación, compartiendo los mismos valores de comercio justo e impacto comunitario; y el equipo de proyección social cuenta con amplia experiencia en el desarrollo comunitario y educación, lo cual genera una mezcla ganadora para nuestro proyecto. 
 
Su apoyo!
 El equipo se encuentra trabajando en diferentes enfoques para llegar a la meta y todas las contribuciones cuentan!.  Necesitamos 40.000 dólares para poder invertir en la adecuación de un lugar, la maquinaria y utensilios para que el Café pueda entrar a operar lo antes posible.
 Tenemos una oportunidad única para celebrar y agradecer a los patrocinadores del proyecto, ya que nuestros recursos tanto en el arte y la cultura, como en nuestro modelo social son bastante grandes.  Tenemos para esto diversas opciones, pues cada donante, de acuerdo al monto, puede tener: su nombre en los diversos espacios del café, postales y artesanías que tendrá como recuerdo. Por favor, eche un vistazo a nuestros beneficios en el lado derecho y así también vea cuánto pueden contribuir a nuestro proyecto.
Nuestra meta es flexible, ya que vamos a seguir recaudando fondos con otros métodos, si no podemos alcanzar nuestra meta.  Realmente esperamos que a través de hacer realidad el Café de Innovación podamos mostrar el asombroso concepto que es el financiamiento solidario!
 Todas las ayudas sobre la meta fijada van a entrar en el apoyo a las familias del Chocó! Si usted no nos puede apoyar con dinero, pero le gustaría ayudar por favor, comparta nuestro proyecto y la historia con el mayor número de personas posible. ! Realmente lo apreciamos!

<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>I should probably start off with what drives me toward these types of projects. As far back as I can remember there has been this feeling in my gut that there was so much that was wrong, and that I needed to do something about it. When I was younger I would see the homeless and always ask my mom if we could help them. I convinced my parents to adopt a child from the T.V. infomericals as a child, because the images upset me so much. I get very angry at the issues that our world faces, mostly because I'm so saddened by the horrible issues that people encounter. I believe that there is always hope. In such a big world it's easy to feel like what we do doesn't make a difference, but I have seen that idea to be incorrect. Personally growing up there were some obstacles that I encountered which were difficult and hard to deal with, but there were always people in my life who cared and strived to ensure that I was given the best chance to succeed in this world. People matter. What people say and do matters more than anything else. People matter more than money, and politics, and religion. At the end of the day we are all people with the same emotional capabilities and capacity for love and that is why I know that my purpose on this earth is to help as much as I possibly can and contribute positively where I can be of assistance. I want to be a servant to the world, even if that world only involves my small community.

The programs place volunteers in a variety of projects in and around Hanoi (the capital of Vietnam) and in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) including teaching English and French, caring for disabled children and working with local Non-governmental organizations. In the information I have been given I have been told to understand that resources are extremely limited in the institutions I will be working.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this possible I have decided to fund-raise. That's where all you lovely and gracious people come in. As a college student obviously I am not rolling in dough and in this tough economy I am aware that many people have been struggling and continue to do so. For those of you who have been blessed with the finances and would like to donate It would be greatly appreciated. For those of you cannot help financially I would greatly appreciate your prayers and positive thoughts. I would love any kind of support that you are willing to offer. I have currently raised $1000 and I am currently trying to raise another $1500. My flight alone cost $1500, the program fee is another $600, plus the insurance cost is about $200, and there are other minor expenses that the rest would cover.<br/><br/>Now a task like this can seem daunting, because it is so much money, but any small amount that you could contribute would be significant and it really adds up. For example, If 100 people donate $5 each then I would have $500 dollars or if 100 people donate $10 each then I would be at $1000, you get my point. Any small sacrifice that you could give would not go in vain and would be deeply appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I often hear people comment that change is not possible, but any positive meaningful impact that you can have on one person is a step towards change. Likewise I often hear people comment about all the unfortunate social issues that individuals face. Through your donation you not only help me achieve this dream of mine, but you also indirectly affect the lives of children. I am a firm believer that we can constantly learn new things especially from different cultures, and my hope is that what I learn there will transform me into a better person.<br/><br/>I would love any support you can give me and I hope that you would take my plea to heart and help me on this journey. Sending many blessings your way :)<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Rebecca Denis</p>

The Magic Hat helps chronically ill children tap into their inner
magic and empowers them to be brave. If they believe in magic they
get to wear the Magic Hat. Once they have the Magic Hat on, they get
to mix their magic with the hat magic and then get to put their fear
into the hat and take out the courage they need to get through the
next hospital procedure they are faced with. This is done with
storytelling and play.										</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The Mr. Grampa  project is unique in
that it not only addresses the childs needs but the needs of the
parents and caregivers as well. By helping the child magically
transform their fear into courage relieves stress and anxiety for all
concerned thereby creating a calmer healing enviroment. The child in
effect becomes a participant in their own healing process.								</p>

Atlanta, just the numbers for 2007 were 14,235 children under the age
of 21 diagnosed with some sort of cancer. Thats 39 per day, every
day. That does not include those diagnosed before or since and does
not include any adults. Now imagine those kids feeling more
courageous and empowered in their own healing process while the
parents and caregivers are feeling less stress and anxiety. That is
the goal. We are building an extended community of like minded people
who reach out from a place of genuine knowing because they have faced
the exact circumstances faced by newly diagnosed patients and
parents.													</p>

Cancer 6 times over the last 33 years. I have been dealing with this
emotional roller coaster for all that time. In order to survive I
underwent 15years of therapy, volunteered 8 years in hospice, and
worked with kids with cancer or  kids who's parent or grandparent has
cancer. My experience is all from in the trenches, not learned from a

magic and empowers them to be brave. If they believe in magic they
get to wear the Magic Hat. Once they have the Magic Hat on, they get
to mix their magic with the hat magic and then get to put their fear
into the hat and take out the courage they need to get through the
next hospital procedure they are faced with. This is done with
storytelling and play.										
The Mr. Grampa  project is unique in
that it not only addresses the childs needs but the needs of the
parents and caregivers as well. By helping the child magically
transform their fear into courage relieves stress and anxiety for all
concerned thereby creating a calmer healing enviroment. The child in
effect becomes a participant in their own healing process.								
The Statistics Of Childhood Cancer Are Staggering. According to the CDC (center for disease control) in
Atlanta, just the numbers for 2007 were 14,235 children under the age
of 21 diagnosed with some sort of cancer. Thats 39 per day, every
day. That does not include those diagnosed before or since and does
not include any adults. Now imagine those kids feeling more
courageous and empowered in their own healing process while the
parents and caregivers are feeling less stress and anxiety. That is
the goal. We are building an extended community of like minded people
who reach out from a place of genuine knowing because they have faced
the exact circumstances faced by newly diagnosed patients and
parents.													
What Does Your Financial Support Provide?

		a. I have written a book and it needs
to be illustrated, published						
		b. Development and manufacturing of
the Magic Hat. (the sale of the first two items hopefully will
support our efforts to grow and bring help nationwide.)							
		 c..Web site design and development
with 3 chat rooms. Kids, Moms, DADS				
		d. Business start up costs.
		e.Office equipment/staff

 About Me And The Mr. Grampa Project. This project evolved from my experience of having a child who has had
Cancer 6 times over the last 33 years. I have been dealing with this
emotional roller coaster for all that time. In order to survive I
underwent 15years of therapy, volunteered 8 years in hospice, and
worked with kids with cancer or  kids who's parent or grandparent has
cancer. My experience is all from in the trenches, not learned from a
book. A decided edge when it comes to dealing with a distraught
parent. I represent a strong, positive male voice in this arena.				
If we go over the initial amount of
money requested it will help us make this happen in more places,
faster. If you believe in this project please send this link to your
friends, family, business contacts asking them to do the same. That
way we have a lot of people getting involved with a worthwhile
project that will help our most vulnerable population, our
kids.						
Anyone contributing any amount will
be listed on my web-site under the heading PEOPLE WITH HEART AND
VISION. I will list you by state and name only. Hopefully this will
generate a little competition among states. In all events the kids
will benefit and that is what counts. Take a moment and go over the
rewards and see which makes the most sense for you and don't forget
to pass the link to your contacts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

in Brazil are disheartened, trust no one, have no hope for a better life – they
are cutting down thousands of precious fruit and Cocoa trees (thousands!!!) on their
properties, because the middle men pay almost nothing for their produce, so to
gain a living they cut down trees to plant grass in order to raise cattle –
which are easier to care for and they need no helpers.</span><br/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>They then counsel
their sons and daughters to go away, to large cities to get a “better
education” and become “qualified” professionals. These small farmers and their
wives get old and sick, and go to the large cities without an income to suffer
to the end of their lives. The large farmers and huge companies then buy their
land for nothing.</p>
<p>Compounding the
problem is when their sons and daughters enter further into the forest,
devastating new areas to start their lives – and so, the problem only grows,
“silently” during the nights.</p>
<p>My background was in
a Non Profit organisation in the capital city of Brazil for 18 years, I moved
here for a quiet life, but was somewhat taken aback by the local situation, now
I am a small farmer who wants to give a better future for my only son and for
the sons and daughters of those millions. But how to do that alone? It is
impossible.  My family currently bake breads at home to sell.  If I
stop baking them at home and stop selling them from door to door how can I take
care of my families needs and still help others? </p>
<p>There are varied long
term projects that encompass education to practical job and ongoing skills for
the actual people who live in the areas all requiring a REforest agreement to
proceed, ensuring a spreading success.<br/>
All done in a way to use and protect natural resources as their precious money

are cutting down thousands of precious fruit and Cocoa trees (thousands!!!) on their
properties, because the middle men pay almost nothing for their produce, so to
gain a living they cut down trees to plant grass in order to raise cattle –
which are easier to care for and they need no helpers.
They then counsel
their sons and daughters to go away, to large cities to get a “better
education” and become “qualified” professionals. These small farmers and their
wives get old and sick, and go to the large cities without an income to suffer
to the end of their lives. The large farmers and huge companies then buy their
land for nothing.
Compounding the
problem is when their sons and daughters enter further into the forest,
devastating new areas to start their lives – and so, the problem only grows,
“silently” during the nights.
My background was in
a Non Profit organisation in the capital city of Brazil for 18 years, I moved
here for a quiet life, but was somewhat taken aback by the local situation, now
I am a small farmer who wants to give a better future for my only son and for
the sons and daughters of those millions. But how to do that alone? It is
impossible.  My family currently bake breads at home to sell.  If I
stop baking them at home and stop selling them from door to door how can I take
care of my families needs and still help others? 
There are varied long
term projects that encompass education to practical job and ongoing skills for
the actual people who live in the areas all requiring a REforest agreement to
proceed, ensuring a spreading success.
All done in a way to use and protect natural resources as their precious money

</ul><br/></div>","A Madagascar, 70% de la population vit en milieu rural et 80% vit essentiellement des activités agricoles. Cette population paysanne produit la plus grande part de l'alimentation de la population dans l'ensemble. Mais cette population qui travaille dur et qui nourrit les populations ""riches"" des villes est la plus pauvre, la plus vulnérable et la plus mal nourrie. Ceci est généralement dû à une structure socio-économique néo-esclavagiste de fait et en grande partie à la faiblesse du développement du secteur agricole dans les campagnes malgaches faisant du paysan un acteur toujours asservi, dépendant des intermédiaires et acheteurs profiteurs des villes. Notons que ce phénomène existe partout en Afrique.La permaculture (de culture permanente), est une discipline holistique qui vise le bien-être des humains en harmonie avec la nature. C'est une approche nouvellement promue par Ecovillage Madagascar sur le territoire malgache. Fort de son expérience sur d'autres unités déjà mises en place, Ecovillage Madagascar organise un atelier de renforcement et de création du 2 au 14 Novembre 2014, avec ces 12 jours de travaux intensifs durant lequel des spécialistes de différentes nationalités vont collaborer avec les paysans locaux malgaches pour mettre en place un modèle de système permacultural permettant d'atteindre l'autosuffisance alimentaire et l'indépendance totale du paysan à moyen terme.Ecovillage Madagascar (voir notre site sur www.ecovillagemadagascar.com) est un projet couvrant 5 ha de terrain servant en même temps de site de production d'aliments sains et naturels, de site de formation à la permaculture, de site d'expérimentation et recherche-action et un site de détente et de relaxation pour ceux qui cherchent le calme et la sérénité à 30km de la capitale bruyante et polluée de Madagascar, Antananarivo.Le site est structuré en plusieurs unités permaculturales dont l'évolution varie. L'unité N°6 sur la carte ci-dessous fait l'objet du  présent projet.L'unité N° 6 couvre environ 1200m² et est en pente avec une dénivellation d'environ 25m. De grandes surfaces avec des pentes douces se trouvent en amont et des rizières se trouvent en aval sur le bas fond. Le terrain est exposé à l'ouest et est venteux. Le sol est actuellement pauvre mais un petit cours d'eau tiré des sources en amont y passe et permet d'irriguer toute la pente.Le défi est de construire une unité permaculturale bien conçue pour permettre l'autonomie totale à moyen et long terme. Ecovillage se propose de réaliser ce défi dans un délai de 12 jours avec une équipe d'une vingtaine de personnes.Le projet prévoit 
la construction d'un petit éco-habitat pour les paysans qui vont y habiter et travailler 
la construction et l'aménagement de tout le système de rétention d'eau (petits étangs) et d'irrigations (canaux)
la construction des terrasses avec les plantations
la plantation d'arbres pionniers avec une serre ou pépinière et un petit atelier de travail

la mise en place de différents éléments classiques d'un système permacultural tel que compostière, lombricompostière, spirale d'herbes aromatiques, tracteur à poule ...

Cette illustration donne une idée d'un scénario de transformation du paysage de l'unité N°6 après 2 à 3 ans d'existence. Les fondations seront mis en place durant les 12 jours de la formation, y compris les terrasses, les canaux, la maison et la plantation d'arbres bénéfiques.Votre contribution et votre appui permettront de supporter :
les charges pédagogiques (matériel et formateurs) qui s'élèveront à 10% du budget, la plupart des formateurs étant des volontaires
les constructions et l'achat des matériaux de construction utilisés durant l'atelier de formation, le tout s'élevant à environ 50% du budget

les frais (alimentation, hébergement, indemnité) des paysans volontaires qui travailleront sur le site durant les 12 jours (environ 25% du budget)

la production d'un documentaire de 20min qui capitalisera le processus et les résultats de travaux effectués durant les 12 jours (15% du budget)
Les travaux les plus coûteux (en matériaux et main d'oeuvre) sont:
l'éco-habitat rural (pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 4 personnes et construit avec des matériaux entièrement locaux)
la serre/pépinière avec une partie atelier de travail et rangement

la fabriquation des étangs et systèmes de canalisations pouvant atteindre 80m

la construction de terrasses pour les plantations

Ci-desous quelques éco-constructions déjà en place à l'Ecovillage Madagascar.Les autres dépenses seront les semences, jeunes plants d'arbre, les petits outils nécessaires etc... Nous pourrons toujours faire bon usage des moyens que vous mettrez à notre disposition quel que soit le montant collecté.Pour que votre contribution soit mémorable et gravé quelque part et en signe de remerciement, nous vous offrons :
l'insertion de votre identité (nom ou logo ...) en tant que contributeur ou sponsor (selon votre contribution) figurant dans la vidéo qui sera produite et et publiée en ligne ainsi que dans le site web d'Ecovillage Madagascar (www.ecovillagemadagascar.com)

une possibilité d'hébergement gratuit à Ecovillage (repas malgache et nuité gratuits) pour vous ou un proche que vous recommanderez si vous passez par Madagascar dans le futur (un délai est toutefois prévu).

Les premières unités permaculturales qui ont été développées à Ecovillage Madagascar ont entraîné des changements importants dans la qualité de vie des paysans et l'environnement dans lequel ces derniers vivent. La première unité a débutée en Décembre 2013 et a pris plus de six mois pour atteindre un niveau de maturité tendant progressivement vers l'autosuffisance et le sentiment de liberté.Le succès de la mise en oeuvre et de la capitalisation d'une expérience d'implémentation modèle en 12 jours dans l'Ecovillage aura un impact non négligeable sur les paysans et le monde rural à Madagascar:
au niveau local, la connaissance et la technicité des paysans augmenteront et s'amélioreront significativement avec la quinzaine de packages techniques permaculturaux qui seront enseignés par différents spécialistes venant de différents pays durant les 12 jours. Cette formation entraînera une amélioration notable des techniques pratiquées et la qualité de vie des populations rurales comme ce qui a été observé dans les unités tendant vers la maturité précédente

au niveau national et plus généralement, la production et la diffusion du reportage sur le modèle renforceront et accéléreront la multiplication de tels systèmes. Le film produit servira de guide et de source d'inspiration pour ceux qui souhaiteraient réaliser des projets similaires dans le futur

Farmers are always dependent on intermediaries and buyers from town who take advantage from their ignorance.Permaculture (from permanent culture) is a holistic planning method to design harmonious human-nature relations e.g. through architecture and agriculture techniques. It's a relatively new approach on the red island Madagascar and it is promoted by Ecovillage Madagascar.Thanks to previous experiences in setting up other Permaculture units, Ecovillage Madagascar will organize a design and implementation training workshop from 2nd to the 24th of November 2014. During 12 days, specialists from different countries will collaborate with local farmers to build a model Permaculture system which aims at food self-sufficiency and later total independence for the farmers who will stay there.Ecovillage Madagascar project (website : www.ecovillagemadagascar.com) covers 5ha of land which serves at the same time as a production site (for organic and natural food), a Permaculture training site, an experimental and action-research site and a site for relaxation for those who look for calm and serenity, 30km from the loud and polluted capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo.The site is structured in seven Permaculture units with different progress status. This fundraising project is related to Unit # 6 on the map below.Unit # 6 covers around 1.200 sqm on a slopy land totaling a gradient of 25m. More land is available above it and the rice field is at the bottom. The land is exposed to the West and is often windy. The soil is actually very poor but a water source and a canal from the upper side allows to irrigate all the land on the slopy side.The challenge is to build a clever Permacutlure unit design to achieve total autonomy in the medium and long term. The Ecovillage will take this challenge and try to design and implement the unit in 12 days with a team of around 20 people.The project plans to:
build a small eco-habitat for the farmers who will stay there
build the water system including the ponds and the swales for irrigation
build the terraces for plantation

plant pioneer trees with a greenhouse and build a nursery during a workshop
build and put in place different elements such as compost heap, worm compost, herb spiral, chicken tractor etc ...

This illustration gives an idea of a scenario of landscape transformation at unit #6 after 2 to 3 years. The foundation will be put in place within 12 days of intense training and collaborativd work with local farmers, including the terraces, the swales, the house and plantation of beneficial trees.


Your contribution and support will cover :



training expenses (material and trainers), around 10% of the budget, note that most trainers are volunteering

 construction costs including materials to be used during the training workshop, around 50% of the budget

basic expenses (food, accommodation and stipend) for volunteers and local farmers, who will work onsite during the 12 days (around 25% of the budget)
the production of a 20 min documentary video capitalizing the process and the results of the work done during the 12 days (around 15% of the budget)

Most expensive items (because of material and labor) are:


the construction of the rural eco-habitat (this place will be designed to host up to 4 persons and will be build with earth bricks on site)
the greenhouse/nursery and workshop 
the construction of ponds and swale systems (maybe up to 80m length)
the construction of terraces for the plantation


Below are some existing eco-constructions built at Ecovillage Madagascar.




Other expenses are seeds, tree seedlings, tools for the workshop etc ... in any case we will use your donation efficiently and update you on our website.
Because we would like your contribution to be memorable and casted somewhere and for acknowledgement, we will offer:



the insertion of your logo/name as a contributor or sponsor in the credits of the video that will be produced and published online on the Ecovillage Madagascar website (www.ecovillagemadagascar.com)


a free stay (including accomodation and malagasy food) for you or a relative you will recommend if you come Madagascar sometimes in the future (there are some deadlines)




The first Permaculture units developed at Ecovillage Madagascar has triggered important changes in the quality of life of the local peasants and their environment. Started in December 2013, the first unit has taken almost 6 months to reach its level of maturity progressing slowly toward self-sufficiency and freedom.
The successful implementation and capitalization of the 12 day eco-implementation will probably have a huge impact and role model effect on the peasantry and rural places in Madagascar:


at local grassroot level: knowledge and techniques will increase, during the 12 days the farmers is given the 15+ Permaculture technical packages taught by international specialists from different countries 
at national level and at a more general level: the production and dissemination of the movie will enhance and accelerate the replication of the system that will be put in place. The film will serve as a guideline and source for inspiration for those who are willing to realize similar projects in the future.

As the student progresses through the lessons and examples, they are rewarded for sound financial understanding demonstrated via in-game decisions. By positively reinforcing good choices with material rewards, we will foster an environment for students to develop strong financial habits.
Specifically, the game is a story line that takes a student through the financial decisions that they will make in their life and the challenges associated with those decisions. Step 1
Create account (Facebook Signup)
Choose a character (high school senior)
Embark on Life Journey
Step 2

Start Financial Tutorials based on life decisions
First Tutorial: Getting a part time job
Second Tutorial: Opening a checking account
Third Tutorial: Balancing a checkbook
X Tutorial:
Step 3

Earn rewards based on achievements 
Example: Get discounts to favorite retailers/restaurants by passing sponsored challenges
Redeem in-game dollars for rewards
The lessons learned from our game will translate into real life results for students. The goal is to show discernible improvement in financial literacy scores in the school districts were the game is implemented. 
What We Need & What You GetWe need $25,000 to fund the development of the game. In order to make this game engaging for students, we need to create stimulating content and refine our curriculum. We have a team of developers, designers, educators, and financial professionals working to generate the content. Your support is greatly appreciated. To show our appreciation, we have designated several perks depending on the level of your financial commitment to the financial literacy cause. The ImpactOur game has the potential to impact the lives of thousands of students that use our game. Common Cents will arm students with the financial acumen necessary to be successful adults. More importantly, it will aim to prevent students from making catastrophic financial decisions that could negatively impact their entire lives. Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that everyone can not provide financial backing for our idea. For the Common Cents team, any and all support is imperative to make our idea a reality and tackle financial illiteracy, especially in informing parents and schools about this exciting new resource.

<h2>Merry Christmas</h2>

<h4>Text in English und unten auf Deutsch</h4>
<p> 

It is Christmas time once again. The first snow has fallen, Christmas decorations have been put out and surely you are enjoying beautiful Christmas markets. Probably you have bought the first Christmas presents, treated yourself to a nice pre-Christmas dinner or booked a nice holiday with the 13th month wages.</p>
<p><br/>

Here in Bolivia it is hard to imagine that Christmas is just around the corner. The rainy season has FINALLY begun, we needed to wait longer than expected for the first rain to moist the dried out land by the strong sun. The last weeks water has often been short, sometimes had been cut off for a couple of days.</p>
<p><br/> 

I could or should also feel Christmassy here in Sucre, a small city in 2800m because globalization has also arrived in this town. Shops are decorated with reindeers and Santa clauses, the market stalls sells Christmas trees, lights and decorations, not to mention the amount of toys and gadgets. But here it hurts seeing these things, which I was so used to in Europe. Because I look around and see Antonio (14) on the street corner cleaning shoes of a client or José (9) and Luis (11) washing cars on the main square, Mario (8) and his little sister trying to sell black plastic shopping bags on the market, Luisa (5) sitting on the cold steps of market helping her mum to sell mangos. For them and <b>so many</b> other <b>working children</b> Christmas will be the same like any other day, maybe they will receive a bigger portion of dinner if they are lucky. But that is it.</p>
<p><br/> 

I work with these children and adolescents who are supported by the <b>educational centre Ñanta</b> on a voluntary basis since February 2009, giving especially support in education as I am a teacher myself.

<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>
With your Christmas donations we could buy the urgently required new desks, chairs and cupboards for the study room, we need new books. Some new paint would make to room look brighter and friendlier. We would love to buy new rucksacks and school materials for the coming term in February. Last year I also bought some sports equipment but of course 150 children using a football and basketball on a regular basis will make sure that it won´t last for many months. It would be wonderful to buy some new ones again. Furthermore not only the rent of our centre where we work have risen, but also water, electricity and food costs and it will be very hard to keep paying everything in 2012. Your donation would also help to keep our centre running well and smoothly.</p>
<p><br/> 

Two days before Christmas also arrive the poorest of poorest in flocks from the surrounding countryside in hope to reach the heart of less poor people in the city. People from these communities often travel days to reach Sucre. In their areas water and electricity is still scarce, they life from local agriculture and farming. Local companies as well as my friends´ language school <b>Fenix</b> <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fenixbolivia.com</a>  start collecting weeks before to be able to help out. Everything is welcome: especially clothes, but also toys for the smallest children, food and school materials. Some might say, it is not right to give out presents and I agree normally – but it is Christmas and thanks to globalization everybody knows it´s Christmas!!! With your support I could buy clothes and school materials and we personally hand everything out through the school.</p>

<h2>Frohe Weihnachten</h2>

Die Weihnachtszeit ist wieder da. Der erste Schnee ist gefallen, die Weihnachtsdekoration schmückt Häuser und Straβen. Sicherlich genieβt du schon die wunderschönen Weihnachtsmärkte, hast die ersten Weihnachtsgeschenke gekauft und dir vielleicht eine Reise mit dem 13. Monatsgehalt gegönnt.</p>
<p><br/> 

Hier in Bolivien ist es schwierig sich vorzustellen, dass in zwei Wochen Weihnachten sein wird. Die Regenzeit hat ENDLICH bei uns begonnen. Jedes Jahr müssen wir länger auf den so ersehnten Regen warten, denn die Erde ist schon seit Monaten durch die starke Sonneneinstrahlung verstrocknet. Wieder kam es soweit, dass mehrmals der Wasserzugang in den Häuern abgedreht wurde, manchmal sogar für einige Tage.</p>
<p><br/> 

Ich sollte mich eigentlich auch in vorweihnachtlicher Stimmung fühlen, denn man kommt daran eigentlich gar nicht vorbei. Die Geschäfte sind hübsch dekoriert, an den Marktständen werden Plasteweihnachtsbäume, Lichterketten und Dekorationen verkauft, ganz zu schweigen von dem vielen Spielzeug. Aber es tut weh diese Dinge, die ich doch eigentlich von Europa gewöhnt bin, zu sehen. Denn ich sehe mich um und sehe meine kleinen Freunde Antonio (14) an der Straβenecke einem Kunden die Schuhe putzen, oder José (9) und Luis (11), die auf dem Marktplatz Autos waschen, Mario (8) und seine kleine Schwester, die versuchen schwarze Plastiktüten zu verkaufen, Luisa (5) sitzt auf den Treppen des Zentralmarktes und hilft ihrer Mutter beim Verkauf von frischen Mangos. Für sie wie auch viele andere arbeitende Kinder und Jugendliche wird Weihnachten wie jeder andere Tag sein, nur dass es vielleicht (man hoffe) ein bisschen mehr zu essen geben wird.</p>

<b>Providing
Fair Trade to Underprivileged Women in Northern Ghana</b></p>
<p>
<i>We
need your help to aid these communities that are in desperate need.</i></p>
<p>
In
an already unprivileged country the women of Ghana aren't even
allowed to own property.  The men of the north take advantage of that
by not allowing women to sell their products at market.  Instead they
must sell to the male shop owners at a fraction of the market price. 

</p><p><b>The Campaign:</b></p>
<p>
By
funding our campaign we will be able to purchase these amazing
products from the women at a fair trade value (at least 2 to 3 times
the amount currently offered) and bring them back to you.  We will
also be documenting our journey to show you how these products are
made and what type of lives these artisans live. 
</p>
<p>
With
the extra money in their pockets, these women, most of them single
with children, will be able to help provide for their families. They will be able to buy things like new shoes, school supplies and medications that are
desperately needed.</p>
<p>
… Oh
and by the way did we mention the products are stunning... No Breathtaking...Amazing...Righteous...We can't decide on a word. You'll  just have to pick one.  
</p>
<p>
Since
the plane tickets have already been purchased your contributions will
go directly to those in need and educating the public on these communities.</p>
<p>
<b>The
funding of this project will go to</b>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
	$300
	will go to being able to offer these women fair market trade value.
	As a general rule we will be offering the women twice to thrice the
	amount they receive from the local men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	$150
	will go into transporting the goods back to America and shipping the
	goods to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>$300
will go to making the various documentaries. This includes the
purchase of memory cards, renting a camera and equipment and the

<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Any
	extra funding will go directly into our next fair trade mission.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>
Your
contributions will help those who labor over their goods and are
taken advantage of provide a better life for their family and
community.  Our main goal for future projects is to set up a steady shipping
lane directly with the women so they can continue to receive fair
market value for their awesome wares. Not only that but you will get
some unique well made products that you can't find anywhere else!</p><p></p><p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p>
<p><i>
Here
is the story on how the idea of this campaign began:</i></p>
<p>
The
idea for this Indiegogo campaign began last year when I decided to
travel to Ghana with one of my theatre professors. In Ghanaian
culture, history is often taught though the use of verbal stories
passed down from one generation to the next. Unfortunately the
crucial role women have played in the history and growth of the
Ghanaian culture is often downplayed or left out altogether. Ghanaian
women of this generation are still left out of decision making, fair
wages, and many other roles while still performing much of the day to
day duties of society.</p>
<p>
While
there we travelled the country from the capitol of Accra in the south
to the small village of Bolgatanga in the north. We listened and
learned from the locals of  their traditions and culture. By using
these ideas and themes we have written our own stories to not only
accent the role of women but to show the importance of gender
equality and social justice. Next month I will be returning to Ghana
with my professor as well as 5 other actors and storytellers to
perform these skits, stories, music, and dances. Our hope is that new
generations will learn these new stories and be providedawith
knowledge and support to work toward an equal and fair life for both
genders.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595766/files/20140521172411-IMG_0359.JPG?1400718251"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><i>The Single Women's Association of Bolgatanga.</i></p><p>
It
was during this time last year I came across many of the interesting
and cool products that were not only well crafted, but had a vibrant
and rich history behind them. Unfortunately the profit from these
products; which often help to support families and communities; are
not going to those who deserve it. The women artisans are often
forced to sell their products to local men for a fraction of the
market price. Instead of buying from the men I often would make
purchases from the women to support their business.</p>
<p>
Then
while competing in an international rock paper scissors competition
over Skype, a friend noticed my Cowrie Shell Necklace and thought it
was so cool he had to have one for himself. After returning home many of my
friends and family began asking about the different products I had
brought back.</p>
<p>
I
then realized that I had a great opportunity to provide two things:</p>
<p></p><ol>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Bring unique
products and cultures back to the people in America.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Help boost the local economies by providing fair trade to the
women who labor and create these products.</span></li>
</ol><p></p>
<p>
In
order to combine these two points I will also be documenting my time
in Ghana with personal interviews and footage of the work put into
these amazing items. It is our hope that by sharing the culture and
inequalities throughout Ghana that we can understand and promote
equality not only here but around the globe.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595767/files/20140521172653-DSCF2928.JPG?1400718413"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Matt and Isaac looking Super Fly.</i><p></p><p></p></div>","Update

Your
contributions will help those who labor over their goods and are
taken advantage of provide a better life for their family and
community.  Our main goal for future projects is to set up a steady shipping
lane directly with the women so they can continue to receive fair
market value for their awesome wares. Not only that but you will get
some unique well made products that you can't find anywhere else!
The
Products:
Calabash
Gourds: The West African Shaker

Made
from hollowed out baby plants and connected with either nylon or
leather; these seed filled instruments have been used for thousands
of years to keep beats and aid in outrageous dances.  

Cowrie
Shell Necklace: The New Fashion

These shells, once used as currency themselves, are now fashioned into high
quality necklaces by locals. They use a sturdy leather backing to
keep the sewn on shells secure and to insure durability.
The
Bolga-Basket: Bolgatastic

Matts
Favorite! These handmade baskets are woven in the north and show a
rich part of Ghanaian culture. Each is made to be durable, malleable,
and unique in design.Excited to be a part of this campaign and obtain these funkadelic products?  Then Pledge Now!




Here
is the story on how the idea of this campaign began:

The
idea for this Indiegogo campaign began last year when I decided to
travel to Ghana with one of my theatre professors. In Ghanaian
culture, history is often taught though the use of verbal stories
passed down from one generation to the next. Unfortunately the
crucial role women have played in the history and growth of the
Ghanaian culture is often downplayed or left out altogether. Ghanaian
women of this generation are still left out of decision making, fair
wages, and many other roles while still performing much of the day to
day duties of society.

While
there we travelled the country from the capitol of Accra in the south
to the small village of Bolgatanga in the north. We listened and
learned from the locals of  their traditions and culture. By using
these ideas and themes we have written our own stories to not only
accent the role of women but to show the importance of gender
equality and social justice. Next month I will be returning to Ghana
with my professor as well as 5 other actors and storytellers to
perform these skits, stories, music, and dances. Our hope is that new
generations will learn these new stories and be providedawith
knowledge and support to work toward an equal and fair life for both
genders.
The Single Women's Association of Bolgatanga.
It
was during this time last year I came across many of the interesting
and cool products that were not only well crafted, but had a vibrant
and rich history behind them. Unfortunately the profit from these
products; which often help to support families and communities; are
not going to those who deserve it. The women artisans are often
forced to sell their products to local men for a fraction of the
market price. Instead of buying from the men I often would make
purchases from the women to support their business.

Then
while competing in an international rock paper scissors competition
over Skype, a friend noticed my Cowrie Shell Necklace and thought it
was so cool he had to have one for himself. After returning home many of my
friends and family began asking about the different products I had
brought back.

I
then realized that I had a great opportunity to provide two things:

Bring unique
products and cultures back to the people in America.
Help boost the local economies by providing fair trade to the
women who labor and create these products.


In
order to combine these two points I will also be documenting my time
in Ghana with personal interviews and footage of the work put into
these amazing items. It is our hope that by sharing the culture and
inequalities throughout Ghana that we can understand and promote
equality not only here but around the globe.Matt and Isaac looking Super Fly.",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are the
Community College of Aurora, a community of 13,000 students representing five
continents and over 60 different countries. Many of us are the first in our
families to attend college and most of us need aid to afford college. We are
rich in curiosity and our commitment to world peace, justice, lifting the
voices of the un- or under-represented, finding common ground, and enabling all
peoples globally to live free of war and oppression. We are not, however, rich in
resources -- which is why we need your help.</p>
<p>We are
raising money to send a delegation of 13 students and 2 advisors to the
National Model United Nations Conference in New York City in March 2015. We
will be the <b>only</b> community college from Colorado to attend the
national conference and one of only a handful of two-year schools nationally. We bring an
important voice to the national conference--a voice that rarely has the means
and opportunity to participate. We are excited to raise our voices, learn,
grow, and achieve in New York City.</p>

Help us join the ranks of famous Model UN alumni like US Supreme Court Justice Steven Breyer, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, and Chelsea Clinton.

<p>Selwyn School is a private, non-profit school of 150 students from Early Childhood - Grade 12. For over fifty years it has provided a high-quality education for students from Denton and surrounding communities and beyond.</p>
<p>The fire that tore through the main building early Thursday, Jan. 26, destroyed everything in the Music, Art, and Kindergarten through Grade 5 classrooms; the Administrative and Business offices; and kitchen. </p>
<p>Even though this fire was financially devastating, this tragedy has brought students, parents and alumni together to share their grief at this loss, to help clean up the campus and move forward rebuilding our school....one brick at a time.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>After nearly 4 years of developing the Aloha Movement Project 501c3 and the AMP ""Education Energy"" Program, Jonathan Fritzler has been nominated to attend the United Nations World Youth Congress in June of 2012. As a representative the United States of America and an ambassador of Hawaii, Jonathan will be given the opportunity to speak to hundreds of young leaders from around the world, and share his vision of how AMP will transform higher education, and the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a keynote speaker, he will empower students to reconsider the real value of their ""Education Energy"" and share his message of how students school projects can be implemented in the real world to have a positive impact in their communities.  His workshop will encourage students to ""Plant an AMP"" within their university, and join a world wide movement of students who implement positive change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""He has been selected among thousands of applicants for his motivation and interest in the Rio+20 Summit, his cultural values, and his active commitment to his community to build a sustainable future and the green economy"" - Roberto Vamos, Executive Director, World Youth Congress.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Be a part of the Aloha Movement Project's first international outreach: AMP South America! The cAMPus cAMPaign is designed to change the paradigm of higher education, and empower students to become peace leaders and social entrepreneurs. In South America the youth often face the challenge of finding viable means of financial support for their families, resulting in students leaving school early to work and support their families. Jonathan Fritzler is on a a mission to spread the AMP Movement to student activists, social entrepreneurs, innovators, and revolutionaries. His book ""Plant an AMP"" will help students realize where opportunities exist within the university and how to utilize all the resources available to create positive change in their local communities. </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Before Jonathan departs on his journey, he plans to hire the best webdesigners to build a bullet proof web platform designed to unite students across the world (est. $10,000). In June of 2012, Jonathan will embark on a journey to Rio De Janeiro. Our first expense is the plane ticket for $1,800. The UN will cover all ground expenses including food, lodging, and transportation once he arrives in Brazil. Upon completion of the World Youth Congress, Jonathan will tour to Universities across Brazil on his first official cAMPus cAMPaign. $2,000 of the funding will cover travel, accommodation, and food while he tours with a team of Spanish and Portugese speaking AMPtivists. $2000 will provide Fritzler with the ability to launch his cAMPaign to media outlets in target cities, and host events which will feature an empowering presentation, music, and food. The remaining $7,000 will cover the cost of travel, accomodation, food, and cAMPaign expenses in the United States as he tours to schools, summer camps, churches, and festivals which match our mission. The remaining $2000 cover the Indigogo Fees. </p>

The day care center alone served ~50 children until Hurricane Sandy flood damage destroyed it. The loss of the center and the church’s services created devastating ripples throughout the tightly knit community. It is imperative that this center of one of Rockaway Beach's communities is opened again as soon as possible.</p>
<p>During the week of March 17-23, ten college students spent their Spring Break helping clear away some of the damage done to Rockaway Beach, NY during Hurricane Sandy. During their time there, these young individuals found that it was not merely a week of volunteerism, but rather a life-altering experience that they would never forget.</p>
<p> The students who worked at St’ John’s have committed to raising at least $15,000 to help revive this center of the community.</p>
<p> The students traveled from all over the country, including longer distances like California, Utah,Missouri, etc., unsure of what to expect in Hurricane Sandy-affected areas. They were shocked to see how much work was left to be done in places like St. John's Baptist Church. Many around the country remain unaware of the amount of damage that still lies untouched in many parts of New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p> While the volunteers finished an amazing amount of work during their time in Rockaway, much more is left to be done. They were able to clear out two of the bathrooms and kitchen that once held 7 feet of water, however, extra steps must be taken to make the building habitable again.</p>
<p> Mold remediation, a process that will ensure that no one using the building again will become ill due to flood damage, costs about $10,000. After this process is completed, upwards of $25,000 will be necessary to fix the plumbing and electricity alone.</p>
<p>This church is not merely a place of worship; it is a thriving center that ties the diverse community in Rockaway Beach together. The people have lived through the storm, and now helping each other recover, are heroes. Even though entire neighborhoods have been devastated,many are working tirelessly each day. We’re asking you to fight alongside them.</p>
<p>Regardless of your religious affiliation or personal beliefs, help us bring this symbol of hopeand safety back on its feet. Although we are not all part of the Rockaway or even Christian community, we are all human, and each of us deserve a safe, joyful gathering place.</p>

Regardless of your religious affiliation or personal beliefs, help us bring this symbol of hopeand safety back on its feet. Although we are not all part of the Rockaway or even Christian community, we are all human, and each of us deserve a safe, joyful gathering place.
Please give what you can. We believe it's the way we come together as a whole that inspires the world. With your help, St. John's Baptist Church will be able to truly reflect the passion and hope of the people working to rebuild it.
 
Sincerely,
 
Ten college students who believe they can change the world for the better.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>These days, the competition to get accepted into some of the most academically competitive colleges in the United States is more cut throat than ever. Good grades, impressive SAT scores, and involvement in school activities are no longer enough to grab the attention of that certain college’s eye. Students need to up their game to gain the advantage that will get them right where they want to be when applying for colleges, whether it be from taking high level AP courses to engaging in nationwide scholastic competitions.</p>
<p>                With all this being said, I recently began to run out of ideas of things I could do to up my game and make me standout when applying to the colleges I hope to attend. As a rising high school senior, it seemed as if my time to participate in extra academic experiences was running out. However, an opportunity recently fell into my lap that sounded too good to be true! This academic enhancing opportunity is sponsored by People to People.  People to People is an organization that provides student ambassador trips for high school and college students to help enhance student’s overall performance in life. Not only do these expeditions help give students the chance to immerse themselves in various cultures that differ from their own, but also provide high school and college credit. A once in a lifetime opportunity that would not only allow me to view the world from a different perspective but also provide me with real life knowledge and experiences that will enhance my college essays and applications? Sign me up!</p>
<p>                The trip I hope to be able to attend is the Winter Break 2013 Mediterranean Holiday Expedition to Barcelona and Rome. This trip would provide me with the chance to experience the traditional cultural experiences that I’ve learned about throughout my academic career along with participating in a hands-on experience that is meant to enhance my grasp of art, history, language, and architecture in various places of the globe. Academic wise, language is a subject I’m personally interested in, so this trip would provide me with the materials needed to help gain a different view on how languages affect certain cultural interactions as well as increase the level of interest my future college letters will soon need.</p>
<p>                To be able to walk where ancient gladiators once stood or stand in the presence of some of the most historically influential cities and landmarks throughout world history, such as the Vatican, would truly be a humbling and academically enhancing experience. Chances like this don’t come along very often which is exactly why I’ve decided to let my guard down and educate myself on a whole new level! Any amount of donation would be very much appreciated, and any excess money that is not used towards this trip will be used for future college prep experiences. This trip will help shed light on the world that exists outside the United States along with giving me new profound global knowledge that colleges are looking for when accepting their applicants!

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>     Hello, my
name is Ncamsile Vilakati. I am 23 years old and I live in Tshaneni, Swaziland,
Africa. I was born in Hlathikhulu (in the Shiselweni region of Swaziland). Here
are a few things you should know about me. Swaziland is a place
where teenage pregnancies are very high and as a result many students drop out
of school. I was the result of a teenage pregnancy and my mom didn’t know who
the father was. It was not easy growing up without my mom or not knowing who my
dad was. This affected me a great deal because growing up I had no sense of
belonging. In Swaziland a child born outside of wedlock is not supposed to go
with her mom to the new family. When I was young my mother married and started
a new family and I was left home with my grandma. Even though my mother was working, she barely
helped me financially. My grandmother treated me well but did not have much to
give to me. I recently met my father in 2009, but he has no interest in getting
to know me. He never calls and when I asked him to help with school fees for
nursing school he said he’d rather use the money to fix his car. I moved to my
current home with Make (siswati for mother) Sizakele in Tshaneni, in February
2012. <br/></p>
<p>     Since moving to Tshaneni my life has seen major improvements. I finished
secondary school and have been accepted to Good Shepherd College of Nursing.
However, Make Sizakele cannot afford to pay my school fees as she is currently
supporting four other children and is a single mother. She has done what she
can and I am very thankful for her help. This is the first time in my life that
I feel like I have a purpose and a chance to fulfill my dream of going to
nursing school. Despite not receiving help from my real family, I refuse to give
up on my dream. Through the help of some friends and family I was able to pay
the initial school fees but they were over a month late. If I do not fundraise
the money soon, I will lose my place at the college and possibly my last real
chance of making my life better for myself. I am ambitious, hard working, and
willing to do anything to get a better education. My goal is to fundraise the
necessary school fees <b>(4000 USD</b>) for
nursing school. The $4000 will pay for my two year program. Raising the money
enables me, with your help, to continue my dream and gives me a fresh start for
my future. When I’m not thinking about school, I enjoy going to church, singing
in the choir and spending time with my family (Make Sizakele and her children).
I thank God for the life He has given me and I am determined to make a better
life for myself. <br/></p>

<p class=""yiv6335184158msonormal""><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p class=""yiv759278966msonormal"">The Miragoane Association of teachers of English (MATE-TESOL) was founded in 2003 as a professional community for EFL teachers, educators, researchers, administrators, and students committed to enhancing English language teaching and learning in Haiti. MATE fosters exchange of ideas, professional networking and peer-to-peer knowledge, while providing resources, expertise, and professional educational guidance on issues affecting this field. MATE, through TESOL International Association, engages and trains thousands of secondary education public school English language teachers in Haiti. For its 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Affiliate Conference to be held in August 2013, MATE will be the host of an American keynote speaker from TESOL. This year the focus will be on Global Trends in English Language Learning and their implications for English Language Teachers.</p>
<p class=""yiv6335184158msonormal"">English is hugely important as an international language and plays an important part in different countries. It is learned as the principal foreign language in most schools in Western Europe. It is also an essential part of the curriculum in far-flung places like Japan and South Korea, and is increasingly seen as desirable by millions of speakers in China.      </p>
<p class=""Default"">With the fast-paced changes brought about by globalization and technological development, TESOL professionals need to understand current socioeconomic factors and their influence on English language teaching (ELT). The industrial societies of the past are giving way to a new postindustrial economic order based on globalized manufacturing and distribution; flexible, customized production; the application of science, technology, and information management as the key elements of productivity and economy growth; and increased inequality between those who control technological and media resources and those who lack technological access.</p>
<p class=""Default""> <strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">The principal objective of the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Affiliate Conference is to provide needs-based professional development for TESOL teachers in Haiti. This conference focuses on promoting an understanding of the impact of the English language in an era of changing global economy and technological development and the role of TESOL instructors in facilitating students’ conceptual understanding of such impact.</p>
<p class=""Default""> MATE TESOL promotes best teaching practices in the English language education. Within the framework of this conference, effective professional development will</p>
<ul>
<li>improve and increase teachers’ knowledge of methodologies used in the teaching of English in the twenty first century;</li>
<li>give teachers the knowledge and skills to provide students with the opportunity to use technologies that are accessible to students to enhance fluency;</li>
<li>advance teacher understanding of effective instructional strategies;</li>
<li>align with and directly related to global trends in English language learning;</li>
</ul><p class=""Default"">In order to increase practitioner’s content knowledge and pedagogical skills, and to cause increases in students’ English fluency, sessions are coded so that practitioners can schedule a series of sessions designed to provide intensive professional development within a focus strand.</p>
<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>
<p>An estimated number of TESOL instructors from different regions of the country are expected to participate in the conferences. </p>
<p><strong>Session Format </strong></p>
<p>All presentations are expected to provide well-planned, interactive, and meaningful experience for practitioners. Handouts are required and may be subject to review.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Seminar/Demo</strong>: Workshop content will be presented in a two hour lecture format.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Workshop Hands-On:</strong> These sessions are designed to be fully interactive with the audience and</p>
<p class=""Default"">facilitate the audience in gaining material, hands-on knowledge around the given topic.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Panels</strong>: Consist of 3-4 presenters who are coordinating their presentations around a central theme. Each presentation will be 15-20 minutes in length.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract of key Presentations:</strong></p>
<p class=""Default""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Teaching English as a global language</span></strong></p>
<p class=""yiv524657798msonormal"">The field of English Language continues to be deeply shaped by economic, social and technological changes happening on a global scale. For instance, English has taken on a prominent role in science, economics and diplomacy.   In under-resourced countries, English proficiency is often seen as a vehicle to social mobility.  As a result, an increasing number of countries have implemented educational policies that seek to teach English language in early grades and use English as a medium of instruction.  In this session, participants will learn how these mega trends affect their profession and their classroom experiences.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Teaching English against all odds</span></strong></p>
<p>What can Haitian teachers of English do to help their students overcome adversity and foster their academic and social achievement? Having grown up in a country where social and economic inequalities and the devastation of war were barriers to growth and education, Rosa Aronson will draw on her personal experience and research to discuss ways teachers can foster resilience among students and prepare them to become prosperous and productive global citizens in an interdependent world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""Default""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Global English and Community Advancement</span></strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">Globalization will result in the further spread of English as an international language and a shift of authority to nonnative speakers and dialects. Economic and employment trends will change the way English is used. Increasingly, nonnative speakers will need to use the language daily for presentation of complex ideas, international collaboration and negotiation, and location and critical interpretation of rapidly changing information. Information technologies will transform notions of literacy, making on-line navigation and research, interpretation and authoring of hypermedia, and synchronous and asynchronous on-line communication critical skills for learners of English. The above changes, taken together, will render ineffective curricula based strictly on syntactic or functional elements or narrowly defined tasks. Rather, project-based learning-incorporating situated practice and critical inquiry, and based on students' own cultural frameworks-will be required if students are to master the complex English literacy and communications skills required by the emerging informational economy and society. In this session, participants will understand the importance of adjusting their teaching to the needs of the local community.</p>

Presentation
The Miragoane Association of teachers of English (MATE-TESOL) was founded in 2003 as a professional community for EFL teachers, educators, researchers, administrators, and students committed to enhancing English language teaching and learning in Haiti. MATE fosters exchange of ideas, professional networking and peer-to-peer knowledge, while providing resources, expertise, and professional educational guidance on issues affecting this field. MATE, through TESOL International Association, engages and trains thousands of secondary education public school English language teachers in Haiti. For its 9th Annual Affiliate Conference to be held in August 2013, MATE will be the host of an American keynote speaker from TESOL. This year the focus will be on Global Trends in English Language Learning and their implications for English Language Teachers.
English is hugely important as an international language and plays an important part in different countries. It is learned as the principal foreign language in most schools in Western Europe. It is also an essential part of the curriculum in far-flung places like Japan and South Korea, and is increasingly seen as desirable by millions of speakers in China.      
With the fast-paced changes brought about by globalization and technological development, TESOL professionals need to understand current socioeconomic factors and their influence on English language teaching (ELT). The industrial societies of the past are giving way to a new postindustrial economic order based on globalized manufacturing and distribution; flexible, customized production; the application of science, technology, and information management as the key elements of productivity and economy growth; and increased inequality between those who control technological and media resources and those who lack technological access.
 Objective
The principal objective of the 9th Annual Affiliate Conference is to provide needs-based professional development for TESOL teachers in Haiti. This conference focuses on promoting an understanding of the impact of the English language in an era of changing global economy and technological development and the role of TESOL instructors in facilitating students’ conceptual understanding of such impact.
 MATE TESOL promotes best teaching practices in the English language education. Within the framework of this conference, effective professional development will

improve and increase teachers’ knowledge of methodologies used in the teaching of English in the twenty first century;
give teachers the knowledge and skills to provide students with the opportunity to use technologies that are accessible to students to enhance fluency;
advance teacher understanding of effective instructional strategies;
align with and directly related to global trends in English language learning;
In order to increase practitioner’s content knowledge and pedagogical skills, and to cause increases in students’ English fluency, sessions are coded so that practitioners can schedule a series of sessions designed to provide intensive professional development within a focus strand.
Participants
An estimated number of TESOL instructors from different regions of the country are expected to participate in the conferences. 
Session Format 
All presentations are expected to provide well-planned, interactive, and meaningful experience for practitioners. Handouts are required and may be subject to review.
Seminar/Demo: Workshop content will be presented in a two hour lecture format.
Workshop Hands-On: These sessions are designed to be fully interactive with the audience and
facilitate the audience in gaining material, hands-on knowledge around the given topic.
Panels: Consist of 3-4 presenters who are coordinating their presentations around a central theme. Each presentation will be 15-20 minutes in length.
Abstract of key Presentations:
Teaching English as a global language
The field of English Language continues to be deeply shaped by economic, social and technological changes happening on a global scale. For instance, English has taken on a prominent role in science, economics and diplomacy.   In under-resourced countries, English proficiency is often seen as a vehicle to social mobility.  As a result, an increasing number of countries have implemented educational policies that seek to teach English language in early grades and use English as a medium of instruction.  In this session, participants will learn how these mega trends affect their profession and their classroom experiences.
Teaching English against all odds
What can Haitian teachers of English do to help their students overcome adversity and foster their academic and social achievement? Having grown up in a country where social and economic inequalities and the devastation of war were barriers to growth and education, Rosa Aronson will draw on her personal experience and research to discuss ways teachers can foster resilience among students and prepare them to become prosperous and productive global citizens in an interdependent world. 
 
Global English and Community Advancement
Globalization will result in the further spread of English as an international language and a shift of authority to nonnative speakers and dialects. Economic and employment trends will change the way English is used. Increasingly, nonnative speakers will need to use the language daily for presentation of complex ideas, international collaboration and negotiation, and location and critical interpretation of rapidly changing information. Information technologies will transform notions of literacy, making on-line navigation and research, interpretation and authoring of hypermedia, and synchronous and asynchronous on-line communication critical skills for learners of English. The above changes, taken together, will render ineffective curricula based strictly on syntactic or functional elements or narrowly defined tasks. Rather, project-based learning-incorporating situated practice and critical inquiry, and based on students' own cultural frameworks-will be required if students are to master the complex English literacy and communications skills required by the emerging informational economy and society. In this session, participants will understand the importance of adjusting their teaching to the needs of the local community.

<p>But the thing is, it's in November, and she has to let them know in just over a week, so it's short notice, and will all add up to about $2500.</p>
<p>She was going to just say no, but I thought, well, it's her birthday in a couple of weeks,  and I reckon that there would be a bunch of people who would like to help her be a part of such an amazing opportunity to make incredible connections and just generally spread her awesomeness to the world!</p>
<p>If that's you, it would be so fantastic if you wanted to help Ruth take up this incredible, out of the blue opportunity to connect with media influencers from all over the world! </p>
<p>It's a short time-frame, I know, so if we don't raise the necessary funds, all donations are returned to you guys! But I totally think we can make it happen, what do you think?</p>
