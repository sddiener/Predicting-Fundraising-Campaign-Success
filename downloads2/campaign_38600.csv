<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
</div>
<div>Check out the video above of our 2010 show! Over the years we've done an amazing consumer fireworks show for our friends at Norris Lake, Tennessee. We've skipped a couple of years due to financial issues and scheduling but I have had many requests to do another fireworks show at Bellville dock over the 4th of July Holiday for 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As many of you are aware, the shows I have put on over the last few years have been pretty good for a consumer show however, they are a bit expensive and even though I can purchase in bulk at a discounted rate, I usually have had around $2500 or more in expenses.<br/><br/>With that said, I'll need your help covering the cost to bring the shows back to ""Hooty Hoo"" Cove!<br/><br/>I absolutely love doing these shows as I'm a pyro at heart but can't justify (or afford) spending that much each year on my own. Many people have suggested that I ask for donations in advance which I hate doing because the show is kind of a thank you from me to all my lake friends for making the summer special. But, in order for me to do this again I'll need some help from everyone who wants to see it happen.<br/><br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need approximately $2500 for class C (1.4G) fireworks, fusing materials, shipping costs and miscelleneous supplies.</p>
<p>We do all the prep work (I start a month in advance of the show laying everything out), site set up (we'll be working the day of the show while you enjoy the lake around you), and that evening we'll light the sky for your eyes!</p>
<p>I purchase fireworks in bulk at wholesale rates and my previous shows have be about $2500. I start my purchasing in the winter months for best discounts but if we don’t reach our entire goal all money will be refunded.</p>

<p>We have Perks for different Donor Levels! Check out the perks for donations to the right!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
Every little bit you contribute gets us closer to our goal. We need your help to make this happen and we only ask that you help us with whatever you can aford or feel it's worth to you.</div>

We are students, activists, community organizers, artists, and we are concerned about the mindless destrucion of our Mother Earth, our Father Sky and the well being of all our relations. For many years we have organized around the environmental issues that affect us in our community. We have surveyed and studied the roots of our environmental problems. We have raised awwareness and protested. We'ver held events, built gardens, built allies with neighbors, organizations, institutions and mentors. We facilitated countless toxic tours of our neighborhood, lost battles and won some.  Our most recent victory is the closing of two coal power plants, Fiske and Crawford; they agreed to close up their toxic factories, Fiske in 2012 and Crawford in 2014. We are dynamic individuals, ready to take our activism abroad to Panama on a Rainforest Awakening adventure. In the Bocas del Toro region, the Naso and Afro-Panamanian People, are fighting to maintain their quality of life as indigenous people. Current construction of a Hydro-electric dam threatens them. The Rainforest Awakenings program offers a holist approach to environmental protection, through meditation, trust building activities and the practice of council we will learn to protect nature and build community. We will vision solutions and learn new ways to organize our communities against environmental violence. We intend to document and share the struggle of the Panamanian people, the beauty of the land and our transformation as community leaders. What We Need &amp; What You Get We have had success leading fundraising campaigns in our neighborhood. Now, we are learning about the power of fundraising on-line. We have applied for scholarships and are hosting fundraisers in our schools and community. It is our hope that you will join our efforts to grow as leaders, build stronger global community and protect the planet. During this campaign, we are requesting funds to contribute to 10 passports and our program deposit for 12 students. 10= passports (10 X $125) Deposit for 12 students (12 X $325) = $5150  Check out our unique perks! You will also get information on what is happening in Panama from our unique Youth perspective and directly from Panamanian people. You can connect with us and follow us on Facebook. If we do not reach our fundraising goals, students will still purchase their passports to be used for study abroad programs in college. The funds will be saved and additional fundraising efforts will take place to prepare for this trip for this year. We are also fundraising and writing grants for plane tickets, additional program costs and equipment neccessary The Impact Environmental Impact: Awareness will be raised about the destruction caused by power plants on a global scale. We will be able to directly connect our local struggles with that of the Panamanian people and understand on a deeper level why the work we do is so important. We will be better informed about root causes of environmental destruction and experience a holistic approach to rainforest preservation. We will be empowered by knowledge and experience and better prepared to speak with other young people about real ways that we can continue to protect the planet. This will be the creation of an alternative model of how to support young leaders as they work to create a healthier planet. Social Impact: The lives 10-12 Chicago youth will change forever! They will reap the benefits of your generosity and concern for others. This will have a tremendous positive effect on their self-esteem and will also teach them how to build quality relationships with others and the global community. They will gain heightened leadership skills, advocacy skills, interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, cultural diversity and awareness skills, and have a broadened perspective of the opportunities available to them as they become successful adults.  Many more young people will be inspired and encouraged by the youth that will benefit from this amazing experience.   8 More reasons why this project is impactful! - Youth will document there journey and bring that documentary back to there respective communities  - Youth will become stronger leaders that will pass the torch to the next generation, which is also known as rites of passage -Youth will gain applicable communication and relational skills for college, jobs and entrepreneurial ventures -   Youth will gain global leadership skills, critical thinking skills, and strategizing skills -   Youth will experience the healing power of Mother Earth and community -   Youth will have the opportunity to participate in healing circles to share their experiences and connect with a community that understands and cares -   Youth will learn about the importance of relying on natural resources versus industrialized resources  -Youth will understand how social injustice impacts the world and their ability to participate in the creation of a healthier planet.

We are also fundraising and writing grants for plane tickets, additional program costs and equipment neccessary The Impact Environmental Impact: Awareness will be raised about the destruction caused by power plants on a global scale. We will be able to directly connect our local struggles with that of the Panamanian people and understand on a deeper level why the work we do is so important. We will be better informed about root causes of environmental destruction and experience a holistic approach to rainforest preservation. We will be empowered by knowledge and experience and better prepared to speak with other young people about real ways that we can continue to protect the planet. This will be the creation of an alternative model of how to support young leaders as they work to create a healthier planet. Social Impact: The lives 10-12 Chicago youth will change forever! They will reap the benefits of your generosity and concern for others. This will have a tremendous positive effect on their self-esteem and will also teach them how to build quality relationships with others and the global community. They will gain heightened leadership skills, advocacy skills, interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, cultural diversity and awareness skills, and have a broadened perspective of the opportunities available to them as they become successful adults.  Many more young people will be inspired and encouraged by the youth that will benefit from this amazing experience.   8 More reasons why this project is impactful! - Youth will document there journey and bring that documentary back to there respective communities  - Youth will become stronger leaders that will pass the torch to the next generation, which is also known as rites of passage -Youth will gain applicable communication and relational skills for college, jobs and entrepreneurial ventures -   Youth will gain global leadership skills, critical thinking skills, and strategizing skills -   Youth will experience the healing power of Mother Earth and community -   Youth will have the opportunity to participate in healing circles to share their experiences and connect with a community that understands and cares -   Youth will learn about the importance of relying on natural resources versus industrialized resources  -Youth will understand how social injustice impacts the world and their ability to participate in the creation of a healthier planet.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> VRSLouisville is expanding our scope to make sure that all members of our community and especially children are protected from Radon.  Along with testing homes of low-income families, we are also focusing on where our kids (and your kids) spend a majority of their days.</p>
<p>In Louisville, there are over 100,000 children are under the age of ten and 39,000 of them attend daycares regularly either in preschool activities or after school programs.  How many children can be saved from Radon issues including asthma, pulmonary problems, cancer and even death?</p>

<p>There are over 400 daycares in the Greater Louisville Metro and many of these locations are based in private homes.  Daycare regulations along with the Fire Marshall yearly inspections, do not have any regulations or testing for Radon contamination.</p>

<p>Even making the problem worse, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has shown that due to the size and rapid respiration of children, the risk of lung cancer resulting from exposure to radon may be 2 times as high as the risk to adults.  If children are also exposed to tobacco smoke, the risk of getting lung cancer increases at least 20 times.  Personally, we have measured homes as high as 28 which equates to smoking 3 packs of cigarettes a day or having 4 chest x-rays per day.  Every person in that house, including infants are constantly being bombarded by Radon.  Radon is a REAL DANGER and we cannot be fast enough to address this.    These children have no ability to protect themselves and VRSLouisville is focused on improving the quality and longevity of their lives. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We at Shift like to find magic in the mundane. After being inspired by a cutting edge UN report on the potential of waste, we decided to commit ourselves to being at the forefront of this energy revolution – nay, a poo-volution!</p>
<p>We’ve spent months learning the science behind converting poo into power (known as anaerobic digestion), finding the right design for our energy domes, scoping out villages in Pakistan where this would be successful, and building a fantastic team (the author of that UN report is now part of Shift!). Since launching earlier this year, <strong>we’ve built two fully functioning energy domes </strong>in the village of Kakka Kolu, outside of Gujranwala, Pakistan.</p>
<p>We've received overwhelming support from local residents who would like to see more of our domes - which brings us to this campaign.</p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Our grand vision at Shift is to <strong>spark an energy revolution and <i>shift</i> the way people think about waste</strong>. We imagine a world where we can transform the potential of something discarded into something valuable. This campaign is the start of the poo-volution!</p>
<p>We see Shift’s energy domes providing free, safe energy to people around the world, preventing poor health and also preventing climate change. Let us explain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Problems We’re Addressing</strong></h3>
<p>Shift aims to tackle two huge global problems: <strong>1) access to safe energy </strong>and<strong> 2) climate change</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access to Safe Energy </strong></p>
<p>1 in 3 people use unsafe energy, leading to <strong>3.5 million preventable deaths a year</strong>. By providing clean gas, Shift prevents these people from using unsafe firewood for their cooking needs. Firewood is dangerous because it leads to smoke inhalation and a host of respiratory and other health problems. Gas doesn’t. For villages without any electricity, this gas can also be used in lanterns to provide free lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>We’re also preventing climate change by capturing and using methane gas that would otherwise be released from cow waste into the atmosphere. Experts say 15% of global greenhouse gases come from animal emissions (mostly cows), more than even cars!</p>

We must all become leaders in our own lives and our communities to change the direction we are headed ~ Xiuhtezcatl Martinez 13yr old youth director of Earth Guardians
Earth Guardians is an organization of dedicated youth from around the world. We are committed to standing up to protect the Earth, Water, Air and Atmosphere so our generation, and those to follow, inherit a healthy, just and sustainable planet. We are focusing on weaving together the synergy of individual grassroots youth driven projects around the globe, to create one international, intergenerational movement for effective change.Earth Guardian leaders have had the opportunity to participate, inspire, speak, give presentations and perform at youth conferences, festivals, rallies and schools around the globe. Young people are being inspired to take their creative passion into local action by starting Earth Guardian crews in their own communities after seeing how empowering and effective this work can be to create positive change.  These visionary young people need a strong and well-organized team to support them. We need help raising funds
to build our online Earth Guardian action portal and guide
strengthen and expand our local infrastructure
launch our ""Protect Our Future"" campaign
support and build our global team
pursue travel and speaking opportunities to spread our message
empower the expansion of Earth Guardian crews around the world



The Time Is Now
Young people are becoming more aware of the dire state of our planet. They know if we continue to be disconnected from the earth, isolated from each other, and driven by consumption - we will literally destroy our own life support systems. Pollution, climate change, fossil fuel energy, corporate greed, and toxic lifestyles are taking their toll.Youth LeadersWe believe that today’s youth have a vital role in addressing our global crisis and in creating the world we want, and deserve to live in. There is a movement on the rise of young leaders from all over the world standing up to protect our future and help heal the critical state of our planet.
Successful OrganizationThe Earth Guardians have a long history and have been building a successful organization powered by youth since 1995. Our central hub in Boulder, Colorado, works on local, national and international issues as well as providing the support system and management team to assist youth around the globe in building successful campaigns for positive change.  Right now, we have 22 Earth Guardian crews spreading from Boulder to Brazil, New Mexico to Australia, Florida to France. We even have a group in Togo, Africa that has over 500 members, and thousands of individuals who have joined Earth Guardians from around the globe!Endorsements___________________________

</h1><p>It's easier said than done, first of all. My name is Brendan and I've been living this way for 6 months now... chopping my wood for all my heat and most of my cooking, counting the watts on all my devices to make sure they don't over-tax my limited solar panel setup, carrying gallons of water every day from the closest spigate, hanging up my clothes to dry over the stove. I didn't build my house, but that's OK because I have enough on my hands with 3 toddlers and trying to stay connected to friends, family and work out in the connected world.</p><p>My career until this point has mostly been in IT Repair, Web Design and Consulting. I've helped promote and organize campaigns for digital start-ups half a world away against all odds, started the odd business or two, and made many peoples' dreams come true on the Internet. I have also worked full-time helping manage the marketing and logistics of a major organic farm and (thankfully) been able to manage a vegetable garden each year. The transition out of the cushy IT lifestyle and hard off-grid living hasn't exactly been easy, but I think it's worth it in the long run. I hope you'll hear out my pitch and bear with me on how I think my work here can help everybody in the long run, even those who don't want to slog it out in the woods like this. Here I am hoping to develop methods that people can use to live this way and stay connected to school, business and the rest of life - so they can be an example of living in a positive way. We need to develop <i>urban sustainability</i> as well - because if everybody left Seattle or New York to live in the country, we'd ruin the environment.</p><p>It’s important to note that EarthStar is my own brainchild and neither I nor my organization ultimately control the use of this property or have an assured
 permanence here. We are not attached to the outcome in this given 
situation. Any potential donors or subscribers should know that 
EarthStar will continue to be a shifting canvas of ideas, individuals 
and locations not limited to this one which we currently inhabit. We are doing this in the interest of the ideas, designs, information and learning experience that can come out of this and any number of situations. Our 
intention as the organization known as EarthStar- as a hopefully global 
community – is to assist in the establishment of independent intentional
 communities everywhere. While we are staying on this property we hope 
to create more renewable energy systems, water biofiltration, no-till 
permaculture gardens with a wide cornucopia of varieties of organic 
veggies, grains, fruits and legumes. <a href=""http://earthstarfoundation.net/category/organization-core/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read More about EarthStar here</a>...</p><h1>The Situation, In A Nutshell...<br/>
</h1><p>We live in a tiny house in the woods at the edge of the Olympic 
National Park, on a sustainable farm that is over 100 acres of pristine 
forest. Our heat mainly comes from wood from the property, and our power
 comes from 120 watt solar panels on the top of our small cabin. Our basic needs
 of living are covered – and except for want of <i>more</i> sustainability and <i>more</i> resource security,
 this way of living has a richer, more abundant quality than life lived 
in isolation in a much more expensive on-grid apartment or house. We 
have another value system which prioritizes the development of 
community, family, connection to nature, independent learning, and 
ecologically sustainable systems of resource use. We hope to document the process of adding energy and food
 production features onto the cabin and the property, as well as creating a handful of 
geodesic greenhouses and passive-solar structures. Everything we do is being done with the intention of including it in the website, video logs, e-books and other channels of information.</p><p>We're asking for help financially to purchase the equipment we need and 
secure the time to build the prototypes in question. We need to create 
the baseline of security necessary to continue doing both our high-tech 
and low-tech work out here, without reliable power or internet 
currently, in order to educate the world in the ways we are using to get
 by. We have designed the systems we're using and we are designing more to 
use soon. We will be making wind generators and mini hydro generators 
and even generators to use the excess heat of buildings and wood stove 
exhaust to make power as well. We are building the content base of our 
website and monetizing it with links to products and services that help 
the Sustainability Initiate get started, and everybody else get paid and
 keep things going.<br/></p><h1>What We Are Doing Now.<br/>

 micro-funds for the prototype development – stay tuned. For the projects we will be working on right now, we are designing perks for the plans to build these simple energy devices. Right now we 
need to buy some time and materials to accomplish a number of projects 
to prepare for winter. With our own money, we will be primarily 
investing in maintaining power, food, and egg production – and keeping 
everyone warm in their shelters. With your help, we will be putting 
together a number of models and prototypes of independent energy 
devices, developing the more unique technologies, and laying more of the
 groundwork here to provide stable basic needs in the long run.</p>
<p>We hope to develop this community into yet another example to the 
growing map of connected intentional communities that are creating their
 own resource base from the ground up. We will be providing plans and 
detailed instructables for everything here. Expect high-resolution 
detailed plans for the structures and energy devices as low-priced 
kickbacks. Unfortunately we are not in a position to offer 
fully-functional products as kickbacks, and are making no promises to do
 so – though that situation may change as more prototypes are developed 
and testing begins. Everything we develop will be open source and free 
to modify and distribute as you see fit – so it gets out there and 
begins to affect the globe – but please be sure to give initial credit 
for unique features.</p></div>","Building Up a Sustainable Model to Share with the World...

We promote to visitors the experience of real jungle with wildlife in the wild, as it should be.</p><p>For that we chose an area that has amazing biodiversity, and the jungle is incredibly preserved. Located 400 km away from iquitos, 100% of the people working at the Tapiche Reserve are locals to the area. We have built cabins, we have transport (the most expensive part of it), we have accommodation for staff and guests, trails and a program that has made the Reserve one of the most well-rated attractions in the north of the Peruvian Amazon. All the structure we built with our own funding, and the income from visitors provides just enough (sometimes <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">even less) to meet the monthly maintenance coast.</span></p><p>With a quick look throughout web sites of attractions around Iquitos you will soon found out that most of the animals are in captivity or domestic condition.

</div></div>","Our StoryThe Tapiche Reserve was created with the intention of preserving the rainforest  and giving the locals a better way of life, providing a alternative way of income instead of logging or irresponsible and depredatory hunting and fishing. We have so far accumulated many rewarding signs of progress:*Tripadvisorhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294315-d3187519-Reviews-Tapiche_Reserve-Iquitos_Loreto_Region.html* Mammal Watchinghttp://mammalwatching.com/Neotropical/neotropicperu.htmlOne year ago, after the reserve rested for 2 years with no hunting and  logging, and funded by own investment to maintain the locals in different small projects like building cabins, trails and surveillance, we opened for visitors to start providing new jobs for the locals as visitor guides for ex hunters and as cooks and staff at the lodge for the wives and families.   We have a new policy (for Peru) in the tourism, different than most of the places that have animals in captivity or in domestic condition. We promote to visitors the experience of real jungle with wildlife in the wild, as it should be.For that we chose an area that has amazing biodiversity, and the jungle is incredibly preserved. Located 400 km away from iquitos, 100% of the people working at the Tapiche Reserve are locals to the area. We have built cabins, we have transport (the most expensive part of it), we have accommodation for staff and guests, trails and a program that has made the Reserve one of the most well-rated attractions in the north of the Peruvian Amazon. All the structure we built with our own funding, and the income from visitors provides just enough (sometimes even less) to meet the monthly maintenance coast.With a quick look throughout web sites of attractions around Iquitos you will soon found out that most of the animals are in captivity or domestic condition. We want to change that, showing people the animals in natural conditions in their habitats. Even if we don't see animals, just experiencing the preserved primary rainforest is a great experience. But for the jungle and the animals to be preserved and protected we have to give the locals a better opportunity of life, providing them alternative income and education.Our ProjectWe want to build a 40 meters canopy tower with sleeping accommodation on the  level below the top terrace for overnight observation.With this project we will provide at least 3 to 4 months work for the locals.

The project is divided in two phases, Phase 1: about 2 months, finding the fallen logs and cutting into boards and ledgers, then transporting  to the building areaPhase 2: about 1 month, buying the metal parts bolts and metal joints, assembling the tower.The tower will be buit from fallen hard wood, So we need the money for: handcraft :8 workers/month =US$1575.00 x 3 months = US$ 4721.00food US$200/month x 3 months = US$600 metal parts US$ 2100.00 Fuel transport and saw US$ 1200, The most expensive part of this project is cutting the wood where it has naturally fallen in the forest and bringng it to the building area.

<li>My name is Dave Tieff, and most people know me as the lead singer of Laughing Colors. I'm a proud Marylander and I've lived near the Chesapeake Bay for over 30 years. It's always been my dream to create some kind of musical project that would help clean up the Chesapeake Bay, so when I got together with my old friend Rennie Grant from Colouring Lesson, we decided to do just that. Rennie is a talented guitarist and producer, so when I took my song ""Clear Water Dream"" to him our ideas starting flowing.<br/>
</li>
<li>I've always been inspired by what ""Band Aid"" and ""We Are The World"" did for famine relief, so I thought, ""why not get as many notable Maryland musicians as we can to benefit the Chesapeake?"" The response has been nothing short of amazing. So far our biggest challenge will be how to include everyone!<br/>

Runamuk is to create a pollinator conservation and sustainable living

 a keystone species we’re able to do the greatest good for the 
environment.<br/><br/>Located in central Maine, for the last 4 years Runamuk has been a micro-farm on 1-acre serving the people of Madison-Anson and surrounding communities in Somerset County.  We produce heirloom seedlings grown without bee-threatening pesticides, 
fresh produce offered through our CSA, raw honey, and all natural beeswax 
products like soap, and herbal salves.  We practice sustainable farming methods and are certified bee-friendly by the Pollinator Partnership.<br/><br/>Runamuk is active in our local communities as an advocate for pollinator

hiking trails, a picnic area, and an education center for holding workshops related to pollinator conservation, beekeeping, and sustainable living.But first we need to reclaim this old farm!In Return for Your Generous Donations We're Offering:

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>Nature Nurtures Farm brings young people and animals together to build empathy, teach responsibility, and inspire hope. <br/></p>
<p>We serve both youth and animals in need. Our nonprofit farm is a lifelong home and sanctuary to more than 100 rescued farm animals. Youth who are experiencing challenging life circumstances participate in our mentoring program, after-school program, summer camps, and volunteer opportunities caring for animals. <br/></p>
<p>Young people with
emotional challenges often respond to animals in ways they can’t, or
won't, to fellow humans. These bonds elicit a nurturing, empathetic
instinct. Learning to properly care for and understand animals develops
a sense of responsibility and pride. A child whose trust
was shattered by a person is far more likely to risk friendship with an
animal because the animal does not ask questions, doesn't judge, and
never shares his or her secrets. Animals then help to bridge
communication with caring adults, forming emotional skills that lead to
healthy relationships.</p>

<h3>Why We Need You<br/>
</h3></span></span></span><p>We are committed to continuing to serve the youth and animals who need us, but we can't do it without your help. To abide by strict county regulations, we recently learned that we will need to acquire a ""special use permit"" -- and to get that permit we will have to complete some costly upgrades to our facility. What little revenue we generate through annual summer camps keeps our youth mentoring program afloat; without the permit, we'll no longer be able to offer these camps. So we're in a pretty tough spot.</p>
<p>If we can't afford to complete the upgrades required by the county, we are faced with the unthinkable prospect of having to walk away from our life's work.</p>
<h3>What We Need <br/>

</li>
<li>$990: Pre-submission conference</li>
<li>$4,020: SEPA State Environmental Review<br/>

<li>$5,000-$7,000: Cost to drill a new well. (We're really hoping they don't have to go terribly deep! This cost could go up considerably if they have to drill a lot deeper than is typical for our area.)<br/>
</li>
<li>$4,000: Engineering services for public water system, parking, and site drainage<br/>

<li>$3,000: Septic design services<br/>
</li>
<li>$2,600: Indiegogo and Paypal fees, perk fulfillment<br/>

</ul>
<p>Any and all funds raised will go toward the costs detailed above. If we don't meet our fundraising goal, we'll have no choice but to pull funds from our day-to-day operating budget, which will mean cutting skilled, caring staff members and perhaps ceasing our youth mentoring program -- the lifeblood of what we do -- entirely.</p>

It's a courageous journey and it will be one of the most moving & personal stories in the lead-up to the climate talks.  Along the way, the pilgrims are speaking at faith communities and in town squares, sleeping in the homes of everyday people, sharing meals  with strangers - connecting with thousands of people.  It's a genuine effort to lift up the call for climate action,  in the humblest of ways.
Yeb and friends need your support.
The pilgrims are walking across Europe just as winter is beginning.  They need your support.  We need to hire an organizer who can:

identify the safest routes for their journey
find speaking opportunities and coordinate media coverage
manage all the details of the pilgrimage
engage with local communities and make sure every step of the pilgrimage is a chance to build excitement for Paris.
find accommodation - as much as possible the pilgrims are staying for free, but some times they will have to pay for a nights lodging.

<h3>A small miracle</h3>
<p>On October 25th 2011 the beautiful town of Monterosso al Mare (Cinque Terre, Italy) was hit by a flash flood. At least nine people have been killed, many others are missing, homes were destroyed and the town is currently isolated from the rest of the world. They have no electricity, no food and no gas. The damages caused by this natural disaster are endless. It will take years to rebuild everything.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Monterosso occupies a very special place in my heart. Most of my family is from there. I grew up playing soccer on the beautiful beach in <i>Fegina </i>or having a fresh <i>granita </i>while talking a stroll through the town with my friends. It's a little paradise populated with a lot of good hearted people. Being there for a few hours can recharge your soul for a whole year. Now things are different, though. </p>
<p>The beach I used to play soccer on doesn't exist any longer. The streets, shops and bars I went to are buried in feet and feet of mud. Monterosso and it's people are on their knees, praying for a miracle.</p>
<p>We can provide that, at least in a small version of it. PLEASE HELP ME DO IT!!</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>I will personally make sure that the money will be handed to the town's mayor or to the town hall. It will be used to help the population of the town. It might be sufficient to buy some food, restore a few phone lines or finance (in part) the construction of a new sewer system. The old one has been destroyed by the flood.</p>
<p>The town will need more than millions of dollars and a few years to get back to it's everyday life. We can help out, but we need to act now!</p>

Here is one more reason to help:
(from http://www.fattidicronaca.it/ )

Time also to take stock. Vernazza and Monterosso in the Cinque Terre , are on their knees. The mayor of Monterosso Angelo Maria Betta has revealed that in his village the damage amounted to 30 million. All is to rebuild roads, squares, beaches, sewage. ""Monterosso is drowning in the mud but the channels were cleaned - said the mayor - have sold the dry stone walls and a huge mass of mud came down to the sea on Tuesday strength was five and he could not receive. ""
The Government has allocated 56 million for all affected areas, a figure considered to be insufficient since Monterosso alone had thirty million worth of damages!

The Flood is now in Genova!! Please check out the new pics in the gallery! Help us!

<p>  My name's James. I'm a 20 years old, and I've always considered myself a naturalist. Unfortunately, I've grown up with the smell of factories and diesel fumes nearby--I'm from Wilmington, NC, one of the largest ports on the East Coast.</p>
<p>  You know what? I haven't seen enough. I've been here WAY too long and theres still so much beauty in nature that I've yet to see. My biggest fear is that this beauty is fleeting...</p>

<p>So my plan now is to walk through many of these parks, via the Appalachian and American Discovery Trail. I have two goals:</p>
<p>1. I will witness the natural beauty of my country before it is covered with McDonalds' and Jiffy Lubes.</p>
<p>2. All extra money donated will go straight to the Conservation Fund and the National Wildlife Federation in an attempt to keep some natural beauty on this planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
Really, not much. Since I'm walking, food and water is just about the only necessity I need. I'll be camping along the trail most times and maybe renting rooms during inclement weather. I'm pretty cheap.  Above all else, I need the beauty and serenity of our National Parks and trails intact, so that's why all extra donations will be sent to the Conservation Fund and the National Wildlife Foundation to further their efforts of keeping our wilderness as pristine as possible.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Number one priority is to raise awareness of the slow decline of the national parks in the US. Their condition is worsening and less people are coming simply because barely anyone is getting paid to take care of them.</p>
<p>Please, help me donate to these parks so my children may see how our country can be so beautiful!</p>
<p>For anyone that donates more than $20 or more, I'll mail you a postcard from somewhere along the Appalachian or Discovery Trail. Over $100 and you'll get a postcard from every state I walk through. $1000 and I'll also walk to your house and thank you personally for your donation!!!</p>

  My name's James. I'm a 20 years old, and I've always considered myself a naturalist. Unfortunately, I've grown up with the smell of factories and diesel fumes nearby--I'm from Wilmington, NC, one of the largest ports on the East Coast.
  You know what? I haven't seen enough. I've been here WAY too long and theres still so much beauty in nature that I've yet to see. My biggest fear is that this beauty is fleeting...

<p class=""p1""></p><p>We are ocean lovers, activists, and scientists, whose mission is to research oceanic plastic pollution and provide a public narrative.</p><p class=""p1""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Our Campaign</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">This summer we are sailing from Oahu to San Francisco to research plastic pollution in the North Pacific gyre. Gyres are formed by the circular motion of wave and wind currents. Plastic accumulates in high concentration in the center of the gyre, which spans thousands of miles. There's trash out there, but nobody knows how much.</p>
<p>Our team is already involved in the early stages of research and development for this growing concern. Team members have been collecting water samples and researching marine debris since 2004 in the Pacific and previously collected samples in the North and South Atlantic gyres. To raise awareness our founder sailed from California to Hawaii on the Junkraft, which floated on 15,000 plastic bottles (<a href=""http://www.junkraft.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.junkraft.com</a>).</p>
<p class=""p2"">We need to build our understanding of what's going on with plastic in our oceans now, so that we can track changes moving forward. As legislation on production and disposal is adopted and consumption patterns shift to address the growing global concern, we need a means of tracking whether we are making headway. Our research is step one.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We can't do it without your support.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h3 class=""p2"">
<strong>Why It Matters</strong> </h3>
<p class=""p2"">We are concerned about the effect of oceanic plastic pollution on the food chain. As plastic degrades at sea, it breaks into particles small enough to be ingested by birds, fish, and other organisms. Plastic pieces soak up pesticides and other toxic compounds, and potentially leach other toxins as degradation products.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Pollution in the gyre is not restricted to the open sea. Depending on ocean and wind currents, trash gets washed ashore on previously unblemished islands, or even mainland coasts, dirtying beaches and harming wildlife.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Since plastics take immense time scales to degrade, this problem will only get worse. If we do not take steps to understand the scope of the issue now, we will be paying for it later. </p>
<p class=""p4""><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 class=""p4""><strong>What We Will Do With $15,000</strong></h3>
<p class=""p4"">$15,000 covers the costs of water sampling and outfitting our vessel. Water sampling requires trawls, a freezer on board, analysis tools on board, and laboratory access. Our vessel needs a bottom job, davits, watermaker, generator, inverter, fuel tank, auto helm, battery bank, battery monitor, satellite phone, spinnaker, SSB radio, aft platform, and a liferaft.</p>

AMP's work revolves around the emerging science of applied bioremediation. Bioremediation is a pollution mitigation strategy that mimics the decomposition and nutrient cycling processes found in the natural world by utilizing fungi, bacteria, and plants to break down toxic chemicals in polluted aquatic and terrestrial environments.</p><p>AMP works with local community organizers to help individuals and families afflicted by the health and environmental impacts of poorly managed oil extraction processes. Over the years, AMP has taught mushroom cultivation and medicinal mushroom workshops in the Sucumbíos region.

Currently, these pits are fitted with overflow pipes that discharge oil effluent directly into waterways. As a result, it is estimated that over 18.5 billion gallons of petroleum now contaminate this biodiverse and ecologically unique rainforest. On polluted lands, grazing livestock and agricultural crops have also been heavily impacted. People drink, bathe and wash their clothes in these toxic water sources, which afflicts local communities with high cancer rates, birth defects, and severe skin and respiratory ailments. </p><p></p><p>The industrial remediation strategies that the oil companies currently employ are far from efficient in cleaning up pollution. Additionally, helping the affected communities recover from the devastation has yet to be properly addressed. Hence, ecological restoration research that employs low-cost and replicable bioremediation technologies is increasingly important.</p><p>For more information on this issue, please view the documentaries below:<br/></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO1WjFRL_XA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO1WjFRL_XA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Solution To Pollution</a> (17 minute documentary about AMP)</p><p><a href=""http://www.eyesofgaia.com/pb/wp_e91307a5/wp_e91307a5.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.eyesofgaia.com/pb/wp_e91307a5/wp_e91307a5.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blood Of The Amazon</a> (80 minute DVD by donation- filmed in the Amazon researching the effects of the oil industry on the environment and indigenous people)</p><p><a href=""http://www.crudethemovie.com/trailer-and-photos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></a><a href=""http://www.crudethemovie.com/trailer-and-photos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crude</a> (The inside story of the infamous “Amazon Chernobyl” case, one of the largest and most controversial environmental lawsuits on the planet)</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448290/files/20140320144201-chevroninecuador_com.jpg?1395351721"" src="""" style=""width: 563.3915857605178px; height: 376px;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">About the 2014 AMP Study:</span><br/></p><p></p><p>Since February of 2014, AMP team members have been working in the Sucumbíos province of Ecuador, initiating an 18-month project to develop a modular, replicable, and low-cost water filtration system.

About The Amazon Mycorenewal Project
The Amazon Mycorenewal Project (AMP) is a volunteer-run and 501(c)3 sponsored organization under CoRenewal, founded by Mia Maltz (M.Sc. and Ph.D student),  Nicola Peel (Speaker, Environmentalist and Filmmaker), Joanna Zlotnik (M.Sc.), Bob Rawson (M.Sc. president of International Wastewater Solutions) and Freeda Burnstad (B.A.). Since 2006, AMP has worked in the Sucumbíos region of northern Ecuador to develop low-cost, effective, and natural systems for addressing severe pollution and health issues related to industrial petroleum extraction. AMP's work revolves around the emerging science of applied bioremediation. Bioremediation is a pollution mitigation strategy that mimics the decomposition and nutrient cycling processes found in the natural world by utilizing fungi, bacteria, and plants to break down toxic chemicals in polluted aquatic and terrestrial environments.AMP works with local community organizers to help individuals and families afflicted by the health and environmental impacts of poorly managed oil extraction processes. Over the years, AMP has taught mushroom cultivation and medicinal mushroom workshops in the Sucumbíos region. We are currently working towards building long-standing alliances between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.About the Oil Pollution in EcuadorSince the 1960s, various local and international oil companies have established over 1,000 unlined pits filled with petroleum-contaminated wastewater in the Sucumbíos province of the Ecuadorian Amazon. Currently, these pits are fitted with overflow pipes that discharge oil effluent directly into waterways. As a result, it is estimated that over 18.5 billion gallons of petroleum now contaminate this biodiverse and ecologically unique rainforest. On polluted lands, grazing livestock and agricultural crops have also been heavily impacted. People drink, bathe and wash their clothes in these toxic water sources, which afflicts local communities with high cancer rates, birth defects, and severe skin and respiratory ailments. The industrial remediation strategies that the oil companies currently employ are far from efficient in cleaning up pollution. Additionally, helping the affected communities recover from the devastation has yet to be properly addressed. Hence, ecological restoration research that employs low-cost and replicable bioremediation technologies is increasingly important.For more information on this issue, please view the documentaries below:A Solution To Pollution (17 minute documentary about AMP)Blood Of The Amazon (80 minute DVD by donation- filmed in the Amazon researching the effects of the oil industry on the environment and indigenous people)Crude (The inside story of the infamous “Amazon Chernobyl” case, one of the largest and most controversial environmental lawsuits on the planet)About the 2014 AMP Study:Since February of 2014, AMP team members have been working in the Sucumbíos province of Ecuador, initiating an 18-month project to develop a modular, replicable, and low-cost water filtration system. This system will effectively utilize native fungi, bacteria, and plants to treat petroleum-contaminated water that overflows from the unlined basins into waterways. Our design will amplify and reintroduce the organisms that have naturally adapted to these sites in a manner that recognizes and integrates the inherent intelligence of nature (biomimicry).While most bioremediation systems focus on using these organisms in isolation, our project is unique in that we will be combining these species in a multi-trophic approach. The application of such a methodology will provide a significant insight into the power of combining fungi, plants, and bacteria in a simple yet effective bioremediation strategy.During the 2014 expedition, AMP members will: 
Establish a long-term site for continued microbial cultivation. We will identify and profile native microbial flora that are capable of surviving in and potentially degrading the petroleum hydrocarbons that exist in polluted pits. We will then cultivate these species for reintroduction to the contaminated sites.
Design and implement biofiltration systems in contaminated sites of the Sucumbíos region with the help of local and international technicians, students and volunteers. These will be modular and easy-to-maintain systems that will be monitored throughout the 18-month study. 

Report on the laboratory results of our system's efficacy and present our research globally at conferences and community events. As an inexpensive and easy to understand means of testing the biofiltration systems, we will conduct plant performance tests on the treated water vs. contaminated water. 


Submit research results to open access journals and license these findings in the creative commons to
provide available resources within the public domain.The technologies used in our research will be provided to grassroots NGOs and communities afflicted with oil pollution worldwide at no profit. AMP maintains a commitment to uphold ethics-based business alliances to provide scientific resources and recommendations as deliverable services to communities motivated to clean up contamination in their local watersheds.

Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor) growing in a petroleum contaminated pitWhat Your Contributions Will Fund
This Indiegogo campaign will cover the costs
for the 2014-2015 AMP study. While the need for research on industrial
remediation is critical, it is often a challenge to obtain funding to support
pilot studies for cleaning up industrial contamination utilizing bioremediation
strategies. The majority of funding from this campaign will cover costs
for laboratory testing of post-treatment water from our preliminary and
modified installations. The design will be built using
locally-sourced substrates, species, and materials for ease of cost,
replication, and adaptation worldwide.
An approximate budget for this project is:
Laboratory analysis of soil & water samples - $20,000

Soil & water sample shipping and fees- $2,500
Biofilter materials (flow cell materials, pond liner, perforated pipes)  - $1,700
Mushroom cultivation and genetic preservation materials - $1,500 
Microbial population and PCR analysis - $12,000
Biochar production facility - $500
Digital documentation - $300
Ground transportation - $1,000
Airfare and living costs for 6 longterm team members - $12,000 
Cost of producing and shipping Indiegogo perks - $2,000

Indiegogo's fees: $3,500

STRETCH GOALS

$70,000 - we will test for more variables (i.e. biochar, microbial species, substrates)
$90,000 - we will run parallel trials in West Virginia, United States for remediation of coal ash polluted waters 
$110,000 - we will replicate our system in Alberta, Canada for remediation of Tar sands tailings pond effluent
What You Get:Our perks start with a personal thank you. Thank you! We then diversify with AMP logo stickers, Ecuadorian fungi postcards, AMP supporter T-shirts, an AMP mushroom calendar, and a mushroom spawn bag cultivated by one of our members. Perks from our collaborators include volumes of Mycelium Music and Immune Support mycomedicinal capsules from PowerShroom. Also offered is a copy of Earth Repair by Leila Darwish - a grassroots guide to healing toxic and damaged landscapes. Many of the perks for this campaign offer footage of lectures and workshops from the Art and Science of Mycorenewal course that was sponsored by AMP and was held in Santa Cruz, CA in June 2013. This 10-day course taught the skills needed for developing successful grassroots bioremediation projects. The videos taken of these course's lectures are broken up into the following three categories:General Fungi (5 lectures)

association à but non lucratif dont la mission
est de promouvoir la préservation de l’environnement au travers de l’aventure
et la photographie.C'est dans ce cadre que nous allons partir pour un périple à vélo le long de
la côte Est américaine, entre Miami et Montréal, soit environ 4.000km à
travers une quinzaine d’États américains et une province du Canada.Tout au long du parcours, nous
alimenterons un blog photo en français et en anglais. Celui-ci permettra à tout
un chacun de suivre le projet, en relayant au jour le jour, parfois même « en
direct », les détails de cette aventure. Les réseaux sociaux (Twitter,
Facebook, etc.) joueront un rôle important dans cette démarche.  EN / We are two French photographers, creators of Green Pix Adventure, a non-profit organization whose main mission is to promote protection of the environment through adventure and photography.It's for this reason that we plan to travel the American East coast on bike from Miami, FL to Montréal, QC, a distance of about 2,500 miles throughout fifteen US States and one Canadian Province.All along the way, we will maintain a comprehensive and informative photo blog in both French and English, while also posting this information on social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.).  FR / Notre but est ainsi de soutenir l'action de l'East Coast Greenway Alliance, une association à but non lucratif
fondée en 1991 aux États-Unis. Celle-ci se bat pour la création de chemins naturels qui permettront un jour de se rendre jusqu’au Canada depuis le sud de
la Floride, uniquement en utilisant des moyens de transports écologiques comme
le vélo.Nous espérons ainsi leur permettre d’étendre leur influence
et d'inspirer des initiatives similaires à travers le monde. Nous espérons également que notre exemple contribuera à valoriser l’usage de moyens de
transports qui, à l’instar du vélo, soient plus écologiques et favorisent les
belles rencontres humaines. Une problématique qui s’étend bien au-delà du cadre
américain.  EN / Our goal is to spread knowledge of the East Coast Greenway project, which is a developing trail system, spanning nearly 3,000 miles as it winds

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>Our names are Jennifer Gonzalez and Steve Matzker.  We are recent photojournalism graduates from Southern Illinois University Carbondale.  As photographers, it is our desire to tell stories that make an impact. Through the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, and your support, we will have that opportunity.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What we are doing:</h3>
<p>The Pulitzer Center has graciously awarded us with fellowship grants to document water rights issues in Nepal.  Our focus is over the trans boundary Kosi River, on the border of India and Nepal. India is advocating that a high dam be built within the Nepal border. We will document the impact the construction of this dam will have on the Nepalese people.  The proposed dam, desired by India for hydroelectricity and flood management, will displace tens of thousands of Nepalese citizens; destroy their villages, cropland, and businesses.  What will the Nepalese gain?  Both countries share the water, but who owns the rights, those upstream or downstream?  The richer country?  The one with more political might?  The major question, though, is how will this conflict be resolved?  </p>
<p>This project is important to us because we have a chance to give a voice to those who would otherwise not have this option.  We are excited to visually contribute to the dialogue of water rights issues and this is your chance to help us.</p>
<p>With your support, we can spend two months in the small Nepalese communities around the proposed dam site.  The funding we raise will allow us to document the people in an in-depth and intimate way.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What we need and what you get:</h3>
<p>We need $4,000.00 for various expenses between now and our trip on August 5th 2013.  The funding will go towards passports and visas, immunization shots, travel and equipment insurance, plane tickets, transportation while in Nepal, fees for a translator, and accommodations in Nepal.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In return for your support, and level of donation, you will receive personal post cards from Nepal, a personalized video greeting from Nepal, and customized prints upon our return.</p>
<p>We will still go if we do not reach our funding goal, but our time in the Nepalese communities will be cut drastically short and we will not be allowed to build the intimate relationships we need to tell their stories. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This story is important because it will add to the global discussion of water rights issues.  The story of water rights goes back thousands of years. And as the world becomes more populated and more countries vie for this natural resource, whether for its people or for its growing economies, this issue will only grow more heated.  </p>
<p>With your support, we can shed light that the impact of on going conflicts over water can have on individuals across the globe.  The story of the Nepalese is just a small window from which this issue can be viewed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are aware that not everyone can contribute monetarily.  But there are other ways to help!  You can share this video with as many friends as possible and spread the word about our intentions to help tell the story of water rights issues.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>

<h3>Time for a Reality Check...</h3>
<p class=""p1"">In the past year, over 300 campaigns to divest campus endowments from fossil fuels have been aunched across North America. This new wave in the climate movement – what the Nation and Rolling Stone magazines are calling the “largest student movement in decades” – has sparked a new energy in students pushing for their voices to be heard in shaping Canada and the world’s climate and energy future.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At the same time in Canada, the tar/oil sands have continued to expand in size, and in influence over politics and policies in Canada. The last two years have seen environmental policies rolled back, funding cut, and the launch of a $16 million tax-payer advertising campaign to sell bitumen to Canadians and the world. There has never been a more important time for a reality check on climate change, fossil fuels and Canada’s energy future.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That’s why this fall we are bringing together a group of leading academics, advocates and local community activists from the climate and energy community to organize a Tar Sands Reality Check speaking tour on campuses across Canada.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This movement is being led by grassroots community and student organizers, and while we have a lot when it comes to energy, momentum and desire for change, we need your help to raise $5000.00 to make the tour happen. We've already raised enough to cover some of the startup and core costs, but your donation will help us cover travel costs, promotions, bringing frontline community organizers and making the tour have a huge impact! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Last year, the Do the Math tour in the United States galvanized the climate movement in the US, and our goal is make this tour do the same for the Tar Sands movement in Canada. Right now, pipeline projects are threatening land and water all across Canada and we want to organize a tour that brings together and shows the rising movement to protect our planet, climate and future all across Canada. Your contribution will make this happen!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1. Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and with Five of your friends you think can donate $20-$100. </p>

<h3>what we need &amp; what you get</h3>
when i tally up the costs to realize all our desires for a solid, sustainable home that can provide for myself and my loved ones, the amount i come up with is $4,000. that much support would give us the space to firmly establish so many good systems that we'd be able to continue growing our home on well under $1,000 a year. here's how it goes:<br/><p><strong><img alt=""happy goat on pasture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8574883393_510e334e1b_m.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 3px;"" title=""happy goat on pasture""/>fencing -</strong> $800 - costs to use a co-op vehicle to harvest willow for woven fencing, to fell trees by hand from a local conservation department for split rail paddocks, a few good axes and hatchets, and the cost of a rockin' work party to bring our community together to help get paddocks set up to sustainably graze our goats and sheep.<strong><em> (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>animals -</strong> $550 - purchases sheep for fiber to provide clothing, linens, and stuffing for beds or pillows, and meat from lambs well into the future. also meat rabbit does to feed my (guard) dog and (mouser) cats as well as supplement our human diet, and enough heritage breed ducks/chickens to supply meat and eggs to our neighbors, a sustainable source of income long into the future<strong><em> (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>forge -</strong> $400 - pays a nearby friend to set up a small smithing operation on our land to provide our few metal needs and re-shape/re-work existing tools for ourselves and neighbors <strong><em> (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>ceramics -</strong> $600 - labor costs to have a local potter help us build a kiln and pottery wheel on our land so we can ditch the plastic and create our own crocks, bottles, jugs, and water storage barrels</p>

<strong>green stuff -</strong> $600 - purchases over a thousand saplings to provide human and critter food, shelter, erosion control, windbreaks, firewood, fencing, and lumber long into the future, as well as seed for annuals and perennials that will be used for a million things (dyes, fiber, soap, ink, medicine, livestock feed, mulch producers, beneficial insect promoters, and many other purposes)<strong><em> (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)</em></strong><br/><br/><strong>campaign fees -</strong> $200 - roughly covers the fees indiegogo charges for helping us raise this magic money</div>

<h3>the impact</h3>

welcome to shagbark
welcome to my homestead - a six acre haven of sacred sanity nestled within red earth farms land trust in northeastern missouri. my neighbors are dancing rabbit ecovillage and sandhill community, though i like to think this little hollow fills a particular niche.
 Why are we raising money this way? click here to read more.
the dream life i'm manifesting here with my friends is primitive, comfortable, intensely local, and removed from the monetary economy (something you're helping to achieve!). not only that, it's a life and bit of land that's full of magic, welcoming to friends, and balancing beautifully on the edge of the best realities. your dollars in our hands are shifting into local meats raised as close to wild as possible, shelters made directly from our surroundings, ceramics made from the clay we dig, herbal medicines wildcrafted with love and care, hides tanned for clothing, eggs and milk and honey flowing into neighbors' homes. i hope you'll join in the magic that i've begun. to read more about shagbark and our home at red earth farms, click here.


what we need & what you get
when i tally up the costs to realize all our desires for a solid, sustainable home that can provide for myself and my loved ones, the amount i come up with is $4,000. that much support would give us the space to firmly establish so many good systems that we'd be able to continue growing our home on well under $1,000 a year. here's how it goes:fencing - $800 - costs to use a co-op vehicle to harvest willow for woven fencing, to fell trees by hand from a local conservation department for split rail paddocks, a few good axes and hatchets, and the cost of a rockin' work party to bring our community together to help get paddocks set up to sustainably graze our goats and sheep. (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)
animals - $550 - purchases sheep for fiber to provide clothing, linens, and stuffing for beds or pillows, and meat from lambs well into the future. also meat rabbit does to feed my (guard) dog and (mouser) cats as well as supplement our human diet, and enough heritage breed ducks/chickens to supply meat and eggs to our neighbors, a sustainable source of income long into the future (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)
tools - $500 - enough tools for friends to help when they visit, and to process freely available raw materials into usable wool, wood, straw, etc. this is especially focused on specialized metal tools like scythe blades, broadaxe heads, and others that we can haft ourselves and repair on our own for decades of use (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)
forge - $400 - pays a nearby friend to set up a small smithing operation on our land to provide our few metal needs and re-shape/re-work existing tools for ourselves and neighbors  (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)
ceramics - $600 - labor costs to have a local potter help us build a kiln and pottery wheel on our land so we can ditch the plastic and create our own crocks, bottles, jugs, and water storage barrels
sweets - $550 - support to build a dozen hives and start them with honey bees, as well as process that into raw honey, beeswax candles, wax for herbal salves, and mead (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)
green stuff - $600 - purchases over a thousand saplings to provide human and critter food, shelter, erosion control, windbreaks, firewood, fencing, and lumber long into the future, as well as seed for annuals and perennials that will be used for a million things (dyes, fiber, soap, ink, medicine, livestock feed, mulch producers, beneficial insect promoters, and many other purposes) (WE RAISED THIS MONEY!)campaign fees - $200 - roughly covers the fees indiegogo charges for helping us raise this magic money
 

the perks - i want my way of saying thanks to convey what our life is like to you - full of magic and wonder, made up of simple and small things. so your perks are:-word of mouth thanks via the internet, where i share stories from my life with far-flung loved ones and friends-a letter written with a homemade quill and walnut or pokeberry ink-a poem sharing one of many sacred connections with the land-a dreamcatcher made by us from willow, handspun yarn, and feathers-a visit out here complete with tour and a luxurious massage or chiropractic therapy-do you have questions about our lifestyle, or how you can take a step in this direction? anyone who contributes is welcome to a few e-mails/letters worth of advice, direction, or support from me in how you might bring your life closer to the dream world you imagine.
 
NEW PERKS!
-a wooden pipe hand carved by a supportive neighbor-a hand thrown ceramic cup made by a friendly local potter-1 oz. bottle of wildcrafted or respectfully harvested medicinal tincture-a hand forged candlestick/rush light made by a friendly local smith
 
if the full amount we're trying to manifest isn't reached this time around, whatever money is gathered will go toward whichever of these projects feels the most urgent to us in moving forward more effectively on our homestead.

<h4>The Monkton Road Wildlife Crossing: Ensuring the survival of a critical amphibian migration corridor.</h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As this Indiegogo campaign unfolds, an ancient spring ritual
is taking place throughout the Northern Hemisphere – the emergence of
amphibians from their winter habitat to their breeding pools.  Sadly, one of the largest and most diverse
amphibian populations in the northeastern United States must cross an increasingly busy
road – which makes this site also one of the most threatened in the
northeast.  For years, scores of
volunteers have mobilized during peak movement times in the town of Monkton,
Vermont in order to assist one of the larger known and most diverse populations of amphibians in the region to cross a busy road.  Despite the dedicated efforts of volunteers,
more than 50% of the animals migrating across this stretch of road are getting
killed during the annual journey between their upland habitat and vital
wetlands where they reproduce.  As a
result, a regionally significant population of amphibians is in peril of
extirpation.  Traffic rates on this once-rural road are increasing at a rate that has biologists convinced that, without
an infrastructure solution, this population will surely die out.  </span></p>

<p><b>THE GOVERNMENT KILLING OF NATIVE WILDLIFE </b></p>
<p>Our public lands provide some of the best remaining habitat for wildlife, including predators like bears, wolves, mountain lions, and coyotes. Unfortunately, when these animals prey on the unprotected private livestock like cattle and sheep grazing on these public lands, they are often killed by Wildlife Services, a
taxpayer funded program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </p>
<p>Wildlife Services kills millions of animals nationwide every year, more than 3,000 mammals in
2013 just in Idaho! The agency uses aerial gunning, neck
snares, foothold traps, and toxic devices known as M-44s that spray sodium
cyanide into the victim’s mouth, causing tremendous suffering and releasing
toxic chemicals into the environment. <b>Wildlife Services' in
Idaho plans to eradicate coyotes, black bears, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes and
other important carnivores from our wild lands for the benefit of private
livestock and agricultural interests. Wildlife Services also plans to remove
dozens of beaver dams using explosives that will harm bull trout, a protected
species. <br/></b></p>

</div></div>","NEWSFLASH: Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the ruling party has started
 intensive discussions on the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership by the Nov. 12-13 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or 
APEC, meeting in Honolulu. from AP Story Oct. 12

The lines in the sand have been drawn, let’s hope a wave of resistance can wash them away…

Moana  Nui needs your help so that we can fly in some key people
 from around the Pacific to not only voice their concerns over new challenges as a result of new regional agreements like the Trans-Pacific Strategic and Economic Partnership Agreement (TPPA). A new challenge for Pacific Islanders is being called to confront what U.S. Sec. of State Clinton lays out in an op-ed called America's Pacific Century* (Oct 11, 2011).  She writes:""...our work will proceed  along six key lines of action:
 strengthening bilateral security  alliances; deepening our working 
relationships with emerging powers,  including with China; engaging with
 regional multilateral institutions;  expanding trade and investment; 
forging a broad-based military presence;  and advancing democracy and 
human rights.

This agenda will even further negatively impact Pacific Islanders and erode our work for stewarding our peoples, lands and resources. We have one opportunity to speak in a public voice while these agreements are being negotiated at a G-21 APEC summit in Honolulu at the same time.

EconomiesInternational Conference creating a forum for
Pacific Island Peoples strategizing alternatives to APEC, Militarization and
Globalization

When: November 9 - 11, 2011

Where:  Honolulu, Hawaii 
Information:  http://moananui2011.org
and http://ifg.org/programs/apec.html

Honolulu, HI—

Organized
by a partnership of Pacific Islander cultural practitioners, scholars, and
environmental and social activists, and in collaboration with the International
Forum on Globalization (San Francisco), Moana
Nui is intended to provide a voice for Pacific Islanders and set a direction
for their economies in an era of powerful transnational corporations, global
industrial expansion, and climate change.  


The three-day schedule will include a Pacific Island Open
Forum where participants will begin to draft working guidelines that will frame
a pathway to a Moana Nui Declaration.


The organizers of the Moana Nui Conference have planned for three
days of panel presentations, public discussions and breakout sessions that
include: 

1) Indigenous Rights, Economies, Governance 

2) Militarization in the
Pacific 

3) Globalization,
Development and Geopolitics 

4) Pacific Resources,
Lands and Economies 

5) APEC & TPPA: What
We Must Know, What We Should Do

 
The Impact

APEC’s stated goal is the “promotion of free-trade and
investments in the region and whose members make commitments to liberalizing
regulations on trade and investment”. 
As we have seen with the 2008 financial collapse of the housing market,
as well as the struggles of independent farmers against GMO/agri-business over the
last 20 years, ""free-trade"" is a doctrine that means “free of regulations,”
another term for owning or leasing public resources for the benefit of shareholders
profits.  For Pacific Islands, regional ""investments"" include new mining technologies that require the development of infrastructure and security that further alienates peoples from their lands and traditional resources.

Financial institutions and transnational corporations will be the largest
recipients of this ongoing exploitation of people and resources.  The Pacific Ocean is about one-third
the size of the earth, and it is what many Pacific Islanders from across these
vast distances historically call “Moana Nui” (vast ocean). Why this should be of concern is that, these new investment projects threaten the bio-diversity of fragile reef systems and will vastly contribute to climate change, likely turning several small island populations into refugees.

This is the first time an international economic conference
of this magnitude is taking place in Hawaii, on the shores of the United States
Pacific Command Center.  Over $45
million is being spent on funding the security of APEC 2011 and over 15,000
people, including dignitaries, business executives, government trade ministers
and representatives of financial institutions will be in attendance.

We need your help to raise awareness and protect this vital
region from continued exploitation.  
Your contributions will promote the restoration of the traditional
stewardship of our land and ocean resources, a tradition that considers the
balance of people and planet, placing it above profit. It is an arduous road,
but our hope is that we might reduce
environmental degradation and resource depletion while working towards
sustainable communities. 
 
 
What We Need &
What You Get

We aim to raise
$15,000. 
These funds will help to pay for organizational costs, airfare, video
documentation, and promotional material.  If we are able to reach or exceed our

<p><a href=""http://www.arkive.org/argali/ovis-ammon/video-da00.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Argali on ARKive"">Argali</a> wild sheep are listed as Near Threatened throughout their range in Asia, and are of great conservation concern. Shy and easily displaced by livestock and human activity, more research is needed so that <span>effective range management strategies can be developed in Mongolia - before Argali join the Endangered list. </span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Mongolia - The Land of Blue Skies</h3>
<p>I first travelled to Mongolia as a conservation volunteer in 2009, and instantly fell in love. The people are warm, the culture is unique and the wildlife and landscape are truly spectacular. I loved it so much that I returned a year later as a biology field assistant, and spent 3 months living in a traditional ger and working with a small team of great biologists. </p>
<p>This year, since completing my Masters degree, I have the chance to go back again –<strong> but this time to do my own research.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Expedition</h3>
<p>In August &amp; September I'll attach GPS collars to wild Argali, and then digitally map their locations over an 18 month period. This will allow me to build a picture of their grazing ecology; how much they might compete with other species of herbivore such as Ibex and domestic livestock, and the potential for conflict with humans.</p>
<p><strong>The research is really important to Argali conservation</strong>, not least because competition from livestock grazing is likely to increase in the future. Therefore understanding the relationships between both wild &amp; domestic herbivores is vital to creating effective conservation &amp; management strategies.</p>
<p>Living conditions on this trip will be unique to Mongolia, and very different from Western-style living. During the trip I'll stay in a traditional Mongolian ger, without electricity or running water, and will cook &amp; eat a traditional Mongol diet (meat, meat and meat). My ger-mates will be Mongolian biology students and the closest neighbours will be semi-nomadic herders a few km away, so I'll also get a chance to brush up on my Mongolian language skills (yes I can speak a bit of Mongolian!). As there's no internet or phone connection there, I'll keep a journal &amp; post excerpts weekly on my return to give a flavour of life on the edge of the Gobi.</p>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Why I Need YOU</strong></h3>

<p> </p></div>","Argali Sheep
Argali wild sheep are listed as Near Threatened throughout their range in Asia, and are of great conservation concern. Shy and easily displaced by livestock and human activity, more research is needed so that effective range management strategies can be developed in Mongolia - before Argali join the Endangered list. 
 
Mongolia - The Land of Blue Skies
I first travelled to Mongolia as a conservation volunteer in 2009, and instantly fell in love. The people are warm, the culture is unique and the wildlife and landscape are truly spectacular. I loved it so much that I returned a year later as a biology field assistant, and spent 3 months living in a traditional ger and working with a small team of great biologists. 
This year, since completing my Masters degree, I have the chance to go back again – but this time to do my own research.
 
The Expedition
In August & September I'll attach GPS collars to wild Argali, and then digitally map their locations over an 18 month period. This will allow me to build a picture of their grazing ecology; how much they might compete with other species of herbivore such as Ibex and domestic livestock, and the potential for conflict with humans.
The research is really important to Argali conservation, not least because competition from livestock grazing is likely to increase in the future. Therefore understanding the relationships between both wild & domestic herbivores is vital to creating effective conservation & management strategies.
Living conditions on this trip will be unique to Mongolia, and very different from Western-style living. During the trip I'll stay in a traditional Mongolian ger, without electricity or running water, and will cook & eat a traditional Mongol diet (meat, meat and meat). My ger-mates will be Mongolian biology students and the closest neighbours will be semi-nomadic herders a few km away, so I'll also get a chance to brush up on my Mongolian language skills (yes I can speak a bit of Mongolian!). As there's no internet or phone connection there, I'll keep a journal & post excerpts weekly on my return to give a flavour of life on the edge of the Gobi.

Why I Need YOU
As an aspiring conservation ecologist I’m completely independent, meaning the only way I can do this research is by finding imaginative sources of funding. That’s where you come in! 
I hope to raise £1000 towards the GPS tracking equipment I need to collect this valuable scientific data.

<div>Research has shown that the Middle East, like Costa Rica, one of today's more popular vacation destinations, used to be lush with forests.

<div> </div>
<div>In Costa Rica the logging has already started. Huge areas have been deforested and the soil is turning hard. In the hot climate, without trees, the earth doesn't stand a chance. So that's where we come in. Eco Preservation Society has received the rights to go on to protected land and plant 40,000 baby trees. Once in the ground these trees will never be able to be cut down.

<div>With our $12,500 goal we'll not only be able to get these trees planted, but we'll be able to start construction on totally green housing for our volunteers. With our amazing team we will be able to document our progress. Showing the world how to start a sustainable community, from construction of housing, to setting up our garden, to getting a clean energy source up and running. It's our hope that people who access these videos for free on YouTube etc. will implement some or all of these aspects in their own homes. Clean energy, growing your own food, living green, none of these things need to be done out on some farm. You can do them from the comfort of your own home, EASILY!

<b>Meet SJ:</b>I LOVE this planet and I think its SUPER important to do all I can to help protect and conserve what we
got going on. Small day-to-day activities, as well as large life style changes
have helped me to achieve a less wasteful existence. Sure, I am far from the
exemplary Earth citizen but I do try to make a conscience effort every day. I
am a 26 year old returned Peace Corps volunteer, Americorps volunteer and
Student Conservation Association member. I served in Ecuador as a natural
resource conservation volunteer in the Amazon. Having less really made me take
a good look at my extravagant first world ways and adjust my ideas on what I
need to live a good and happy life. It turns out, it’s really not much. I need
the ones I love, air in my lungs, a few good things to eat and a place to call
home!<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial;""> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1027619/files/20141118183938-Page_1.jpg?1416364778"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial;"">Here lies the problem….A PLACE TO CALL HOME. The past few years I have been bouncing around trying to figure myself out, go on great adventures, help others and protect my planet…South America, Central America and right here in the good ol’ USA. This past Summer I worked with the National Park Service mapping native endangered plants in West Virginia. The mapping project was created as an aid to help the park with poaching problems. In Ecuador, I worked with indigenous communities on eco tourism projects to save the forest from the big bad oil companies, single crop farming and logging. I would love to keep traveling and working on conservation projects….but I do need a place to call home….it would be great if I could just bring my home with me…transition to….TINY HOUSE ON WHEELS!</span>

<b>Meet Matt: </b><b></b><p style=""display: inline !important;"">In recognizing what I have, what I use, and what I actually need, I've decided it's not beyond me to not live beyond my means. I think it's a practical response to issues that have risen due to a standard of living that is unnecessary like wasted energy, water, space, and resources of all kinds. I'd like to be less of a contributor to waste, and along the way introduce these ideas to other people. I'm 25 and unlike SJ I have no particular involvement in conservation. My involvement  has been primarily limited to recycling and picking up trash when I see it,  but I am really excited to start living in a way that does less harm and hopefully some good. Not to mention the liberation of no mortgage.</p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""display: inline !important;""> Ive visited 25  of our states and a little bit of Canada in a van playing music with friends, though it was only for a couple weeks for a couple summers, it gave me a taste of the road and I can't think of much I like more than being out there. Sj and I plan to visit national parks, maybe work in some, and take as much in as possible. </p>

<p style=""display: inline !important;"">This project has been one of the best experiences of my life. It's been an awesome creative outlet for me. Since beginning life as an adult working full time, time becomes less for making cool things. </p>After college I managed a specialty hotdog restaurant for a couple years which was really fun and allowed me to be creative, while slang'n dogs was a good time, it was also a role that helped me grow and see what I was capable of. With no experience in actually building anything it's the biggest thing I've ever done and it's only proved to me again that doing anything is just putting your time and mind toward it, nothin to it but to do it. I'd like for others to maybe be inspired by that, whether building a small house or doing something bigger, I hope it  helps people feel more comfortable to try something.

<li>Composting toilet - no this is not a ""litter box"". In Ecuador we built a composting toilet and it worked just fine.

</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>We are currently mid-build. We have around 7,600 invested in our tiny house so far. Initially, we planned on only spending 10,000 to build our dream home and start our traveling life. However, due to some unexpected mishaps we are going to need additional funds.This is why we are here asking for help. We are building our home outdoors and unfortunately we cannot control the weather. Our subfloor got completely flooded during a storm ( a storm strong enough to rip our tarps from our house ) and needed to be replaced...alot of extra work, time and money!</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1131547/files/20150104185104-photo1.jpg?1420426264"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>

The insulation was mostly ruined, we did manage to rescue some of it from the water and will hopefully still be able to use some of it. The plywood flooring now covered in black mold is not really usable for our floor (we will try to use it in some other way if possible). But honestly the damage could have been much worse, so we thank our lucky stars. </div>
<div>We still need to purchase/obtain:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Insulation for the remainder of our floor, walls and roof</li>
<li>Interior wall sheathing<br/>
</li>
<li>Siding (we are looking for reclaimed wood...hopefully barn wood) <br/>
</li>
<li>Flooring<br/>
</li>
<li>Solar Panel System</li>
<li>Heater<br/>
</li>
<li>Sinks<br/>
</li>
<li>Composting toliet materials<br/>
</li>
<li>Counter tops and cabinets <br/>
</li>
<li>Horse trough (for the bathtub) <br/>
</li>
<li>Stove burners, refrigerator<br/>
</li>
<li>Front Door</li>
<li>Underlayment for roofing panels</li>
<li>And alot of small odds and ends <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Not 100% sure how much all of this will cost but we are using as many reclaimed materials as we can find (which are usually less expensive or free) and we are also great bargain shoppers! We still need alot of items to complete our house but we honestly think an extra 2,500 will totally make it  possible.</div>
<div>To give you an idea of what our money has gone towards so far here is a basic breakdown:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Trailer - $3,250<br/>
</li>
<li>Trailer Customization - $491<br/>
</li>
<li>2x4 / 2x6 lumber - $1,380<br/>
</li>
<li>Plywood - $643<br/>
</li>
<li>Hardware, structural reinforcements (Simpson Strong Ties) - $446<br/>
</li>
<li>Insulation - $206<br/>
</li>
<li>Subfloor Materials (aluminum flashing, insulating foam, metal fastners, liquid nail) - $187<br/>
</li>
<li>Windows - $360 (found a giant window at the ReStore for $7!!) =] <br/>
</li>
<li>Drillbits - $59<br/>
</li>
<li>Tarps- $203<br/>

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span>
</div>
</div><div> <p>Once our tiny home is finished we plan on traveling the country, volunteering with organizations that have conservation efforts in mind, possibly working with the Student Conservation Association again or signing up for another Americorps project and eventually going back to school...again...we will forever be students of life.<br/></p>
<p>We will be able to live in a more environmentally conscious  way, independent from societies 'norms' and the hold of the electric and gas companies. We will be using solar energy on a daily basis, a composting toilet and living a more simple tiny life. We will be taking up less space and spending less money. </p>
<p>While traveling we will have a platform to spread the word about the ""tiny lifestyle"" and possibly get a few other tiny dreams started. The hardest part is just starting!</p>
<p>Also I can finally take Walter and Weeze with me when I am volunteering. My cats no longer have to feel abandoned by me.</p>

</div>
</div><div>
<div><ol>
<li>Not having an indoor space to build and trying to build our home out doors. Like I said, we can not control the weather! We have already had massive water damage to our subfloor and we had to re sand the bottom of our trailer (which was the absolute hardest part of this build so far) to remove all the rust and then re paint it...all on our backs, upside down, underneath the trailer. I am still pulling tiny pieces of metal from my legs and arms.<br/>
</li>
<li>Having enough money to even start this project! We both moved back home with our parents to help save on bills and rent while we build our home. And, just like every other 20 something year old in the United States....we have massive student loans...which doesn't make it easy to save and buy building materials. <br/>
</li>

</div></div>","We want to live in a way that is less wasteful and more responsible. We are half way there but we need your help!






Meet SJ:I LOVE this planet and I think its SUPER important to do all I can to help protect and conserve what we
got going on. Small day-to-day activities, as well as large life style changes
have helped me to achieve a less wasteful existence. Sure, I am far from the
exemplary Earth citizen but I do try to make a conscience effort every day. I
am a 26 year old returned Peace Corps volunteer, Americorps volunteer and
Student Conservation Association member. I served in Ecuador as a natural
resource conservation volunteer in the Amazon. Having less really made me take
a good look at my extravagant first world ways and adjust my ideas on what I
need to live a good and happy life. It turns out, it’s really not much. I need
the ones I love, air in my lungs, a few good things to eat and a place to call
home! 


Here lies the problem….A PLACE TO CALL HOME. The past few years I have been bouncing around trying to figure myself out, go on great adventures, help others and protect my planet…South America, Central America and right here in the good ol’ USA. This past Summer I worked with the National Park Service mapping native endangered plants in West Virginia. The mapping project was created as an aid to help the park with poaching problems. In Ecuador, I worked with indigenous communities on eco tourism projects to save the forest from the big bad oil companies, single crop farming and logging. I would love to keep traveling and working on conservation projects….but I do need a place to call home….it would be great if I could just bring my home with me…transition to….TINY HOUSE ON WHEELS!



Meet Matt: In recognizing what I have, what I use, and what I actually need, I've decided it's not beyond me to not live beyond my means. I think it's a practical response to issues that have risen due to a standard of living that is unnecessary like wasted energy, water, space, and resources of all kinds. I'd like to be less of a contributor to waste, and along the way introduce these ideas to other people. I'm 25 and unlike SJ I have no particular involvement in conservation. My involvement  has been primarily limited to recycling and picking up trash when I see it,  but I am really excited to start living in a way that does less harm and hopefully some good. Not to mention the liberation of no mortgage.


 Ive visited 25  of our states and a little bit of Canada in a van playing music with friends, though it was only for a couple weeks for a couple summers, it gave me a taste of the road and I can't think of much I like more than being out there. Sj and I plan to visit national parks, maybe work in some, and take as much in as possible. 




 


This project has been one of the best experiences of my life. It's been an awesome creative outlet for me. Since beginning life as an adult working full time, time becomes less for making cool things. After college I managed a specialty hotdog restaurant for a couple years which was really fun and allowed me to be creative, while slang'n dogs was a good time, it was also a role that helped me grow and see what I was capable of. With no experience in actually building anything it's the biggest thing I've ever done and it's only proved to me again that doing anything is just putting your time and mind toward it, nothin to it but to do it. I'd like for others to maybe be inspired by that, whether building a small house or doing something bigger, I hope it  helps people feel more comfortable to try something.





What is sustainability?

According to the EPA ""Sustainability is based on a simple principle: Everything that we need for our survival and well-being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. Sustainability creates and maintains the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.""
Our tiny home will have components allowing us to use and waste less and reuse and recycle more 


Composting toilet - no this is not a ""litter box"". In Ecuador we built a composting toilet and it worked just fine. If we build it and use it right, it will not smell, it will not use any water and our waste can be used outside to enrich the soil (without being harmful and is completely safe to use)

Solar power 

Gravity fed water system - in the kitchen we will not need any type of pump we will just let gravity do all the work. 

Reclaimed building materials - reducing others waste, diverting materials from ending up in a landfill, supporting Habitat For Humanity ReStore and turning trash into treasure and making it look gooooooooood =]




What We Need

 
We are currently mid-build. We have around 7,600 invested in our tiny house so far. Initially, we planned on only spending 10,000 to build our dream home and start our traveling life. However, due to some unexpected mishaps we are going to need additional funds.This is why we are here asking for help. We are building our home outdoors and unfortunately we cannot control the weather. Our subfloor got completely flooded during a storm ( a storm strong enough to rip our tarps from our house ) and needed to be replaced...alot of extra work, time and money!


As you can see, we had to rip it all out. The insulation was mostly ruined, we did manage to rescue some of it from the water and will hopefully still be able to use some of it. The plywood flooring now covered in black mold is not really usable for our floor (we will try to use it in some other way if possible). But honestly the damage could have been much worse, so we thank our lucky stars. 
We still need to purchase/obtain:


Insulation for the remainder of our floor, walls and roof
Interior wall sheathing

Siding (we are looking for reclaimed wood...hopefully barn wood) 

Flooring

Solar Panel System
Heater

Sinks

Composting toliet materials

Counter tops and cabinets 

Horse trough (for the bathtub) 

Stove burners, refrigerator

Front Door
Underlayment for roofing panels
And alot of small odds and ends 


Not 100% sure how much all of this will cost but we are using as many reclaimed materials as we can find (which are usually less expensive or free) and we are also great bargain shoppers! We still need alot of items to complete our house but we honestly think an extra 2,500 will totally make it  possible.
To give you an idea of what our money has gone towards so far here is a basic breakdown:

Trailer - $3,250

Trailer Customization - $491

2x4 / 2x6 lumber - $1,380

Plywood - $643

Hardware, structural reinforcements (Simpson Strong Ties) - $446

Insulation - $206

Subfloor Materials (aluminum flashing, insulating foam, metal fastners, liquid nail) - $187

Windows - $360 (found a giant window at the ReStore for $7!!) =] 

Drillbits - $59

Tarps- $203

Metal Roofing Panels - $300

 


The Impact

 Once our tiny home is finished we plan on traveling the country, volunteering with organizations that have conservation efforts in mind, possibly working with the Student Conservation Association again or signing up for another Americorps project and eventually going back to school...again...we will forever be students of life.
We will be able to live in a more environmentally conscious  way, independent from societies 'norms' and the hold of the electric and gas companies. We will be using solar energy on a daily basis, a composting toilet and living a more simple tiny life. We will be taking up less space and spending less money. 
While traveling we will have a platform to spread the word about the ""tiny lifestyle"" and possibly get a few other tiny dreams started. The hardest part is just starting!
Also I can finally take Walter and Weeze with me when I am volunteering. My cats no longer have to feel abandoned by me.



 

Risks & Challenges



Not having an indoor space to build and trying to build our home out doors. Like I said, we can not control the weather! We have already had massive water damage to our subfloor and we had to re sand the bottom of our trailer (which was the absolute hardest part of this build so far) to remove all the rust and then re paint it...all on our backs, upside down, underneath the trailer. I am still pulling tiny pieces of metal from my legs and arms.

Having enough money to even start this project! We both moved back home with our parents to help save on bills and rent while we build our home. And, just like every other 20 something year old in the United States....we have massive student loans...which doesn't make it easy to save and buy building materials. 

The thought of epic failure...driving down the highway and pieces of our home falling off and being carried away. The thought of not having enough money to finish or getting stuck in some aspect of construction and not being able to move forward. Building something from scratch when you have never really built anything before is very scary. However, without risk there is no reward! 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't help us out, no big deal! We honestly feel kind of weird asking strangers for money but we figure...you help us now and we can help you later with your endeavors. And if you have no spare change in your pockets just share this campaign with your friends and neighbors or post it on social media.

<h3><strong>BACKGROUND, CONSERVATION SIGNIFICANCE</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Tropical montane ecosystems are highly threatened by climate change and deforestation. These factors modify microclimate and vegetation structure at given altitudes, pushing montane plant and animal communities upslope, therefore increasing the probability of population fragmentation and ultimately the extinction of some species. Forest-dwelling bats are also concerned, as the occurrence of many species is highly dependent on elevation as well as the forest quality.</p>

<p>Frugivorous bats have a significant contribution to forest regeneration in the tropics, due to their particular importance as seed dispersers. For this reason they are perfect subjects of conservation studies investigating the effect of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.  However, very little is known about the ecology of many tropical bat species, they are very understudied compared to other bats in the world, while they are highly concerned in habitat modifications and climate change. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524160441/iu0esaugitey0g7mpnnr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>…HOW?</strong></h3>
<p>Our study will involve extensive fieldwork in Cofre de Perote and the surrounding area (Central Veracruz, Mexico), using mark/recapture techniques, collecting droppings for diet analysis, as well as radio-tracking of the individuals. Biometric data will be collected from each of the captured individuals, a few (max 30) target individuals will be equipped with radio-transmitter, and then released immediately in their living habitat. Radio-tracking is a particularly effective method for studying foraging ecology and habitat use of animals (home range, foraging activity and roosting location). These radio-transmitters have small weights (0.5-1 g) suitable for placing them on small bats, because they are less than 5% of the body weight and bats can carry them without problem (they show no adverse effects).<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524160527/pnzmobkix5ptukqjrlcj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Saving Bats:</strong> Bat community assessment will provide information about bat population health and species distribution, which is highly unknown in Cofre de Perote and the surrounding area. With community assessment (via mist-netting and using bat detectors) we will identify keystone species with a focus on threats to their environment. We also shed light on the factors affecting bat community composition, diet and movements in the forests of Cofre de Perote and its surrounding.<br/><br/><strong>Habitat Conservation:</strong> We will identify „hotspots” where the ecosystem services provided by bats may have key importance for the certain locality, where conservation efforts should be concentrated  and where bat community includes endangered or vulnerable species, in order to propose specific conservation strategies in different elevations.<br/><br/><strong>Community Awareness: </strong>We will develop relationships with local and national governmental agencies to enforce existing environmental laws and assist in the development of future protective legislation. We will provide information to local stakeholders and propose specific management strategies for improving and maintaining habitat conditions in different elevations that are essential for bats. We will educate the community to engage in sustainable practices and develop cooperative relationships with local schools</p>

<h3>COLLABORATORS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT:</h3>
<p><br/><strong>University of Veracruz: </strong>I will spend min. 1 year at the University of Veracruz, thanks to the National Mexican Governmental Scholarship (AMEXCID), which helps me to cover my expenses for housing, visa, insurance and travel and his is an absolute honor and privilege, however due to budget cuts, we are required to seek private funding for a part of the project equipment.<br/><br/><strong>BIOVERA Project -</strong> Exploration and explanation of biodiversity patterns along gradients of climate, soil and disturbance in Central Veracruz Mexico. The project is now growing intensively, we intend to contribute to the project with zoological input, including this research. </p>
<p><strong>Radio-tracking of the bats is a distinct component which would otherwise (in the absence of financial support) not take place. We are seeking for fund to purchase the necessary equipment for radio-telemetry.</strong><br/> </p>

The area where we gonna work is well-studied from botanical aspect, however extensive zoological surveys, including bat research has not yet taken place.

Frugivorous bats have a significant contribution to forest regeneration in the tropics, due to their particular importance as seed dispersers. For this reason they are perfect subjects of conservation studies investigating the effect of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.  However, very little is known about the ecology of many tropical bat species, they are very understudied compared to other bats in the world, while they are highly concerned in habitat modifications and climate change.

…HOW?
Our study will involve extensive fieldwork in Cofre de Perote and the surrounding area (Central Veracruz, Mexico), using mark/recapture techniques, collecting droppings for diet analysis, as well as radio-tracking of the individuals. Biometric data will be collected from each of the captured individuals, a few (max 30) target individuals will be equipped with radio-transmitter, and then released immediately in their living habitat. Radio-tracking is a particularly effective method for studying foraging ecology and habitat use of animals (home range, foraging activity and roosting location). These radio-transmitters have small weights (0.5-1 g) suitable for placing them on small bats, because they are less than 5% of the body weight and bats can carry them without problem (they show no adverse effects).

The Impact
Saving Bats: Bat community assessment will provide information about bat population health and species distribution, which is highly unknown in Cofre de Perote and the surrounding area. With community assessment (via mist-netting and using bat detectors) we will identify keystone species with a focus on threats to their environment. We also shed light on the factors affecting bat community composition, diet and movements in the forests of Cofre de Perote and its surrounding.Habitat Conservation: We will identify „hotspots” where the ecosystem services provided by bats may have key importance for the certain locality, where conservation efforts should be concentrated  and where bat community includes endangered or vulnerable species, in order to propose specific conservation strategies in different elevations.Community Awareness: We will develop relationships with local and national governmental agencies to enforce existing environmental laws and assist in the development of future protective legislation. We will provide information to local stakeholders and propose specific management strategies for improving and maintaining habitat conditions in different elevations that are essential for bats. We will educate the community to engage in sustainable practices and develop cooperative relationships with local schools

COLLABORATORS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT:
University of Veracruz: I will spend min. 1 year at the University of Veracruz, thanks to the National Mexican Governmental Scholarship (AMEXCID), which helps me to cover my expenses for housing, visa, insurance and travel and his is an absolute honor and privilege, however due to budget cuts, we are required to seek private funding for a part of the project equipment.BIOVERA Project - Exploration and explanation of biodiversity patterns along gradients of climate, soil and disturbance in Central Veracruz Mexico. The project is now growing intensively, we intend to contribute to the project with zoological input, including this research. 
Radio-tracking of the bats is a distinct component which would otherwise (in the absence of financial support) not take place. We are seeking for fund to purchase the necessary equipment for radio-telemetry.

<h3>Jumpstart the Biochar Revolution in Haiti!</h3>
<p>We are <a href=""carbonrootsinternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carbon Roots International</a> (CRI), a non-profit based in the United States, and we're working to bring biochar to Haiti and the wider developing world.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, we learned about <a href=""http://www.carbonrootsinternational.org/biochar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">biochar</a>, and began tinkering around in our backyards with different uses and production technologies; after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, we decided to establish CRI and start the biochar revolution in Haiti, where it's needed most.  </p>
<p>A quick primer: <a href=""http://www.carbonrootsinternational.org/biochar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">biochar</a> is a sustainable, charcoal-based soil amendment that substantially increases crop yields, rebuilds the soil, and sequesters carbon. Biochar fosters a healthy ecosystem of microorganisms - it's like a coral reef in the soil! For a country like Haiti, which has severely depleted soil and declining food production, biochar represents a carbon negative way to substantially raise crop yields without the input of chemical fertilizers.  For farmers like Pepe (see video above), <strong>this is HUGE! </strong></p>
<p>Biochar is the <em></em><strong>next big thing</strong> in sustainable agriculture and international development, and we are helping Haitian farmers to lead the way.</p>

<p>After 18 months of refining biochar production technology to its simplest form, we are on the verge of completing our pilot project in the La Coupe valley of Haiti. This will prove that <a href=""http://www.carbonrootsinternational.org/biochar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">biochar</a> can work in Haiti, and that it has a future in the wider developing world. <strong>We need your help to complete our field trials and begin to bring biochar to scale in rural Haiti!</strong></p>

<p></p></div>","What We DoReunity Resources is a Santa Fe-based non profit with a mission to reunite our waste streams with value for our community.  We have spent nearly a year working with City government on approval for commercial food scraps collection for compost, and City Council has just approved the contract!However, The City is not providing funding for the program.  The funding must come from YOU!Provided we reach our campaign goal, we will begin coordinating logistics with restaurant, hotel and grocery store clients in January 2014 (only 5 weeks away!) and begin collecting their food scraps in March 2014.  We have partnered with The City of Santa Fe Environmental Services Division to make a big impact with this program.  We will be scrupulously collecting and sharing data with the City to show the value of food scraps collection to our community and environment. As hotels, restaurants and institutions partner with us, we will be doing trash audits and closely observing how their waste streams change in order to reduce trash collection costs for local businesses and government.   Our program is designed to divert up to 2,000,000 pounds of food scraps from the landfill in its first year of operation.  This is enough organic material to create a pile of apple cores, red chiles, moldy bread and rotten lettuce leaves as high as Mount Everest----this is a BIG DEAL!   In landfills, food scraps are buried and we lose the opportunity to make compost, which replaces the need for chemical fertilizers, retains moisture, and provides nutrients for healthy plant growth. Furthermore, when left in landfills, this organic matter creates methane- a greenhouse gas that traps 21 times more heat than CO2.We are taking the steps toward large scale zero waste reality.  Less than 30% of what ends up in our landfills actually belongs there. Of the 70% that does NOT belong there, at least a quarter is COMPOSTABLE.U.S. soil is currently eroding at 17 times the rate at which it forms: We need nutrient-rich compost to rejuvenate our exhausted soils and grow healthier food!  Let's feed the earth that feed us and help reduce global warming.


What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $143,000 to launch this community compost program.  This money will be invested in the equipment, people, and materials necessary to educate about, separate, collect and haul food scraps to the composting site.  Once operational, the program will be self-sustaining from revenues generated from fees for service. We currently work and are contracted with over 60 restaurants and hotels.  Our unique nonprofit social enterprise model, to date, has been entirely self-sustaining.The money we raise will be allocated as follows:Equipment and Materials: $29,431.005 NEW JOBS:  $98,145.00          (Interested in a Green Job? Contact us!)Marketing:  $6,050.00Insurances: $9,505.00
Many of us want to participate in creating sustainability for our communities but we don't know how.  This campaign is an opportunity for you to participate in an imperative zero waste initiative, for you to say YES to clean air, clean water, full-circle systems and food security.  Let your voice be heard!  Together, we can tell the world we are committed to making changes on a community level for the benefit of all.  We can also offer you fun and practical perks to help you build your community, keep your resources out of the landfill, and help you grow your own food.  We will share our progress with you here through update videos and notes, and we will be thrilled to share the fruitfulness of your contributions with footage of our first food scraps collection in March 2014! How will we reach this goal?  You.Santa Fe is a city of approximately 70,000.  If 1,000 people can support this program with a $100 dollar contribution, we will be 70% to our goal---that's 1/70 of our municipality, less than 1.5% of our city's population.  If we can show our support in creating the kind of City we want to live in with a financial contribution, we will reach our goal in no time flat! Of course, we know not everyone can donate $100 dollars, and we encourage and appreciate support of all sizes.  For a $20 contribution, you can join like-minded folks for an excellent all-ages launch party on Spring Equinox, featuring local music, phenom DJ Bacon (Ben Wright), a silent auction, face painting and more.  Additionally, we are seeking 5-10 Founders willing to make a generous contribution of $5,000 to $10,000 to make a BIG IMPACT on this program and a BIG IMPACT on their community.We are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, and your donation is tax-deductible. As an innovative public-private partnership in municipal composting, our program will provide a valuable model to other cities and organizations around the world--we encourage donations from other communities--let us test this program design and share our best practices with you for your city's success!If you would like to make a contribution but don't particularly want to use the internet to do so, we understand.Our mailing address is:Reunity Resources                                                                                                              1000 Cordova Place #650  Santa Fe, NM 87505Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Meet Antonio: an inspirational young man from an isolated rural community in El Salvador who is passionate and commited to making a difference in this world. I first met Antonio in 2009, a young man who had just had the blindfold ripped from his eyes watching Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. Coming through an education system that leaves most people at the equivalent of a 3rd grade level in any industrialized country, the system does little to prepare young people for the global challenges that we are now facing. In fact, most have never heard of climate change.</p>
<p>From the first day that I met Antonio, I promised myself that I would do everything I could to help him realise his full potential and it has been a fantastic journey for us both. Over the last three years, as Antonio has walked the path to bring about deep, sustainable change both within his life and those around me I have seen a star shine brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>And now - at his brightest yet - Antonio is working as a dedicated and talented young facilitator for the Youth Leaders for the Pachamama climate congresses. In a person-to-person movement that is fast gaining momentum, Antonio works at a grassroots level with young people from 15-25 years of age...helping to wake up a generation of young change-makers, igniting their passion and working together to co-create our sustainable future!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Youth Leaders for the Pachamama congress is a three-day workshop that provides empowerment and leadership skills, the latest science about global challenges and innovative solutions, and skilled support to help participants develop their sustainability action plan to implement in their community.</p>
<p>Each congress is for a maximum of 30 people, a size which allows trust to be developed and deep bonds to be formed. The experience is a completely unique experience for every person that participates, and in more then 90% of cases it is completely life changing. </p>
<p>Antonio's goal is to raise $6,500 ($6,000 + fees and commission) to support these congresses, which will provide scholarships for more than 300 youth to attend. The cost of each congress includes materials, food, transport, venue, volunteer facilitator expenses, a Youth Leaders for the Pachamama t-shirt as well as an unforgettable, life-changing experience!!</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, the funds will still provide scholarships for as many youth as we raise money for.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you make a donation, it isn't just a one-time impact - it is far deeper. In Guatemala and El Salvador (in the world's 3rd largest biodiversity hotspot), almost 50% of the population are 18 years of age and under. That's a scary statistic when you think about how UNINFORMED and UNPREPARED these young people are to lead the way into a healthy and sustainable future. At a time when humanity faces some of its most pressing social, economic and environmental issues it is essential that we have leaders that are informed, educated and aware about these issues and empowered and inspired to creatively innovate new solutions. That's what the Youth Leaders for the Pachamama congress can do. In the short time that we have been running these congresses over 19 new youth environmental groups have started up, more then 90% of past participants are actively involved in environmental projects, and many innovative and creative new initiatives have blossomed from these inspirational young leaders. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>- A demonstration house teaching about urban sustainability with workshops on nutrition, recycling, composting, urban gardening, permaculture, green technology, superfoods and MUCH more (<a href=""http://www.elinfinito.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.elinfinito.org</a>)</p>
<p>- A green and environmentally friendly shelter/safe house for children from Santa Tomás in San Salvador, providing after-hours and weekend programs to teach about living sustainably and being green!</p>
<p>- a clean-up-the beach campaign in El Ahumado, Guatemala!!</p>
<p>- a recycling rally and adopt-a-kilometer clean-up campaign in San Salvador</p>
<p>- an ""eco-brick"" building project using plastic PET bottles and trash from the streets</p>
<p>- a 'seed-savers' fair to reintroduce local, traditional food and preserve indigenous seeds which are fast disappearing due to the introduction of GMO crops and seeds</p>

<p>On May 24th, I participated in a nonviolent direct action protest against the dangerous mining practices of Alpha Natural Resources.  Along with four other activists from the RAMPS Campaign, I peacefully blockaded the road leading to Alpha's corporate headquarters in Bristol, VA, shutting down work for most of the morning.  For our action, my friends and I were sentenced to five days in jail and <strong>over $3,500 in fines and legal fees</strong>.</p>
<h2>
<br/>Why Alpha?</h2>
<p>Alpha, formerly Massey Energy, conducts extremely destructive mountaintop removal (MTR) mining. Forests are razed; the top 400 feet or more of a mountain is literally blasted away to expose coal seams; and ""rubble"" that used to be the mountain's top -- laden with toxic byproducts -- is dumped into valleys, creating ""valley fills"" that bury and pollute streams. All this because it is a more ""economical"" way to mine coal, which means higher profits for coal executives.</p>
<p>After coal is mined, destruction continues when liquid waste (""slurry"") is stored in impoundments, giant earthen dams that hold back billions of gallons of toxic sludge and are notorious for their poor construction.  One of Alpha's impoundments, the Brushy Fork slurry impoundment in Raleigh County, WV, is the largest earthen dam in the Western hemisphere -- but that hasn't stopped Alpha from plans to expand the impoundment. Soon, over <strong>9 BILLION</strong> gallons of toxic coal sludge will be sitting over the homes of people like my friend Junior Walk (<strong>see video above</strong>).</p>
<h2>
<br/>Why I Protest</h2>
<p>The fight against MTR is a fight for the land and people of Appalachia, for the right to clean air and water and a dignified life, and for the future of our planet. It is a fight against environmental injustice, government corruption, and corporate control.</p>
<p>For me, this action was about taking a stand against extreme fossil fuel extraction everywhere: From my home state of New York, here hydrofracking is an imminent threat, to the tar sands of Alberta and the mines of Black Mesa, fossil fuel extraction allows few to profit at the expense of many.</p>
<p><strong>When I locked down to that road on May 24th, I wanted to target the heart of the MTR operation: those who profit from poisoning people.  </strong>We were sent to jail for our nonviolent action, but coal profiteers get off scott-free, which means that we have a lot of work to do.  But I also know that our movement is being heard, and the CEO of Alpha couldn't ignore us that morning when we kept him from getting to work.  I have no regrets.</p>
<h2>
<br/>Support Us!</h2>
<h3>On July 25, we pleaded guilty to blockading a public roadway.  We were sentenced to five days in jail and over $3,500 in fines and fees, and I have an intial fundraising goal of $1,500 for this page.</h3>
<p>We are hoping to get this money paid off quickly, as we are on active probation until all of the fines and fees are paid.  Every little bit helps! If you have even a couple dollars to chip in, we would all be very grateful. It is the support of others like you that allows this kind of bold direct action to happen.</p>

<p>First of all, thank you to everyone who supported my last indiegogo fundraiser. I raised $6,228 after deducting fees. With that money, we successfully drilled a borehole on August 8 with a yield of 3000L/hr! The new borehole will supply safe water to 300 households and directly affects the UN <a href=""http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/environ.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""MDG Goals"">Millennium Development Goal (MDG)</a> #7.c – to increase the number of people with sustainable access to safe water. It was an incredible moment, when water splashed out of the ground. I couldn't have done it without Mahugi's tireless effort in finding a driller and coordinating the project. We were also very lucky to have Mr. Ruben, the original hydrogeologist who conducted the survey, come down from Mwanza to monitor the drilling. The borehole is not the focus of my research but having heard a large village (Lyaudusi) is without clean water, I wasn’t going to turn a blind eye!</p>
<p>The main part of my field research here focuses on an existing piped water supply that has not been operating for months due to poor management. After diagnosing the problem through data collection and semi-structured interviews, I held a meeting with the Board members to pitch my recommendations. I stressed the need to supply water every day and introduce a new pricing system whereby villagers pay 25 Tanzanian shillings per 20L bucket. The Board agreed with all of my recommendations including ones around management, collection, and monitoring. We decided to hold a 3-day trial period to test the meters, as well as the new management and pricing system. We encountered several challenges, but the overall result was very positive and encouraging. I held another Board meeting and we agreed that after all water user groups receive training and revise their constitution, we are going to relaunch the scheme as early as this week. </p>
<p>My project deliverables are to give recommendations. However, this did not seem very satisfying or fulfilling to me. I wanted to see change and a glimpse of an operational scheme while I am still here. The money collected from the fundraiser really helped me implement a lot of the recommendations I wanted to see in action. It gave me the flexibility to test out my ideas and observe its results. Unfortunately, my initial budgeting fell short of the total cost. The breakdown of the costs and shortfall is listed below. I am hoping to raise another USD $675. Again, I appreciate your help very much and I will hopefully give you an update soon!</p>

The main part of my field research here focuses on an existing piped water supply that has not been operating for months due to poor management. After diagnosing the problem through data collection and semi-structured interviews, I held a meeting with the Board members to pitch my recommendations. I stressed the need to supply water every day and introduce a new pricing system whereby villagers pay 25 Tanzanian shillings per 20L bucket. The Board agreed with all of my recommendations including ones around management, collection, and monitoring. We decided to hold a 3-day trial period to test the meters, as well as the new management and pricing system. We encountered several challenges, but the overall result was very positive and encouraging. I held another Board meeting and we agreed that after all water user groups receive training and revise their constitution, we are going to relaunch the scheme as early as this week. 
My project deliverables are to give recommendations. However, this did not seem very satisfying or fulfilling to me. I wanted to see change and a glimpse of an operational scheme while I am still here. The money collected from the fundraiser really helped me implement a lot of the recommendations I wanted to see in action. It gave me the flexibility to test out my ideas and observe its results. Unfortunately, my initial budgeting fell short of the total cost. The breakdown of the costs and shortfall is listed below. I am hoping to raise another USD $675. Again, I appreciate your help very much and I will hopefully give you an update soon!

<h3>Students Helping Kahoolawe</h3>
<p><strong>Hui Malama Na Mea a Kane</strong> is a project-based learning program for middle school students at Hawaii Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences charter school in rural Puna, Hawaii. We're a public school that represents our diverse, vibrant community.  We do a lot of community work as well as environmental work. This campaign is important to us because we really want to help a sacred island in the heart of the Hawaiian Islands named <strong>Kahoolawe</strong>.</p>
<p>Nine students from our program and two instructors are thrilled to have the <strong>rare opportunity</strong> to actually go to Kahoolawe and help with restoration.  We will be working long, hard days, planting native plants, learning about the history of the island, and learning about the cultural importance of Kahoolawe to the Hawaiian people.</p>
<p>Our work on the island will not only benefit the restoration efforts and the nine students going.  Our students will be forever imprinted with a life-changing experience.  They will serve as <strong>Lifetime Ambassadors for Kahoolawe</strong>, teaching out to their peers and younger students about this treasure for all people in Hawaii Nei.  The students will create presentations for our community at large, as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your donation, big, small, or anywhere in between, supports this dedicated group of kids and shows them their enthusiasm is valuable and appreciated.  Show them the world cares, too!</em></strong></p>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal of $2500. in donations from this Indiegogo campaign, along with money the students are earning from car washes, bake sales, movie nights, etc., will:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase round-trip interisland airfare for the students</li>
<li>purchase t-shirts designed by the students to show unity and pride</li>
<li>purchase work gloves and other small equipment our economically students have difficulty in buying themselves</li>
</ul><p>Even if we don't reach our funding goal here on Indiegogo, we're not giving up!  All money donated to this campaign will go to our trip to Kahoolawe and nothing else.  <strong>Every little bit helps!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This island we are wishing to help restore is very important to all the people of Hawaii, and especially to native Hawaiians.  <strong>Your donation supports the legacy</strong> of many organizations, grass roots groups, individuals and cultural heroes who have struggled to maintain the dignity and living culture of the Hawaiian people.  If you have ever felt the desire to right a wrong, make a difference, be a part of the change, then this is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Hui Malama students have a long-standing tradition of <strong>making a real difference</strong> when we take on a project.  Please go to <a href=""http://huimalama.weebly.com/environmental-stewardship-projects-2012-13.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://huimalama.weebly.com/environmental-stewardship-projects-2012-13.html</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>""The future is our youth"" isn't just a catchy phrase for Hui Malama.  We live by that idea, and we consider it our job to give our youth the opportunities they deserve.  <strong>Your donation keeps our future going!</strong></p>

This campaign is important to us because we really want to help a sacred island in the heart of the Hawaiian Islands named Kahoolawe.
Nine students from our program and two instructors are thrilled to have the rare opportunity to actually go to Kahoolawe and help with restoration.  We will be working long, hard days, planting native plants, learning about the history of the island, and learning about the cultural importance of Kahoolawe to the Hawaiian people.
Our work on the island will not only benefit the restoration efforts and the nine students going.  Our students will be forever imprinted with a life-changing experience.  They will serve as Lifetime Ambassadors for Kahoolawe, teaching out to their peers and younger students about this treasure for all people in Hawaii Nei.  The students will create presentations for our community at large, as well.
Your donation, big, small, or anywhere in between, supports this dedicated group of kids and shows them their enthusiasm is valuable and appreciated.  Show them the world cares, too!

 
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal of $2500. in donations from this Indiegogo campaign, along with money the students are earning from car washes, bake sales, movie nights, etc., will:

purchase round-trip interisland airfare for the students
purchase t-shirts designed by the students to show unity and pride
purchase work gloves and other small equipment our economically students have difficulty in buying themselves
Even if we don't reach our funding goal here on Indiegogo, we're not giving up!  All money donated to this campaign will go to our trip to Kahoolawe and nothing else.  Every little bit helps!
 

The Impact
This island we are wishing to help restore is very important to all the people of Hawaii, and especially to native Hawaiians.  Your donation supports the legacy of many organizations, grass roots groups, individuals and cultural heroes who have struggled to maintain the dignity and living culture of the Hawaiian people.  If you have ever felt the desire to right a wrong, make a difference, be a part of the change, then this is a great opportunity.
Hui Malama students have a long-standing tradition of making a real difference when we take on a project.  Please go to http://huimalama.weebly.com/environmental-stewardship-projects-2012-13.html to learn more.
""The future is our youth"" isn't just a catchy phrase for Hui Malama.  We live by that idea, and we consider it our job to give our youth the opportunities they deserve.  Your donation keeps our future going!

<p>Hi my name is Paul Rosolie. For the past several years I have worked in southeast Peru with a local naturalist named Juan Julio Durand to protect rainforest. We have done this by opening our doors to travelers from all over the world. People come and get to see the amazing wildlife of the Amazon, and help to protect the jungle they experience. We accomplish our mission of safeguarding wildlife by operating a research station or lodge on a tributary of the Madre de Dios River. Please check out a link about the work that we do <a href=""http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0310-hance_rosolie.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and also <a href=""http://www.northjersey.com/travel/118995464_Recruiting_volunteers_to_save_the_rainforest_.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Having our lodge allows us to accommodate visitors, who make it possible to protect the forest. People who join us in the forest are not tourists, they are helping to protect our land with us; these are Junglekeepers.</p>
<p>Our research station is a beautiful and serene place located in the middle of hundreds of miles of jungle. However in the last two years our job has not been easy. We have fought off poachers, loggers, and other invaders, and even come close to altogether losing our land and the station. Protecting rainforest out on the Amazon frontier is no easy task. While we have been struggling to keep the forest protected our research station has fallen into disrepair. The palm-thatched roof has developed holes that let in rain. If rain continues to fall onto the floor of the station the wood will rot and we will no longer be able to accommodate visitors and protect the forest. This is what we need your help to fix.</p>
<p> We want to replace the palm-thatch roof with stronger, more durable corrugated steel. This will keep our station safe and running, and make it possible for us to continue protecting our preserve and the millions and millions of creatures within it.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $9,500 before the start of the rainy season (approximately Nov. 15). The money raised will go towards materials, transportation, and labor to fix our roof as soon as possible, before it starts raining!</li>

<li>This is no ordinary ‘donate to a cause’ campaign. We are inviting you to become a part of our Junglekeeper team.

<strong>Everyone who donates to this campaign, no matter what the amount</strong>, will have their names added to a plaque that will be installed at the research station, to make sure that people for decades to come appreciate what you did!</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The loss of life on our planet has been called the ‘defining issue of our time’, and we are alive at a time in history when there is still so much left to save. Today the western Amazon is the largest area of intact rainforest habitat on Earth. It is the most biodiverse place that has ever existed, ever. That means that there are more species of plant and animals there than anywhere else. It holds the world records for birds, butterflies, dragonflies, and amphibians.

<h3>Die Herausforderung<br/>
</h3>
<p>Im  Jahr 1996 erwarb ich ein rohrgedecktes Fachwerkhaus in der Nähe von Greifswald, in einer Ortschaft, aus der meine Vorfahren stammen, deren Linie sich bis in das 17. Jahrhundert zurückverfolgen läßt.</p>
<p>Das Haus, bzw. teile seiner Grundsubstanz stammen aus der Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts. Anlass zu dieser Annahme bieten eine schwedische 1/4 Öre Münze mit dem Datum 1635, die bei Aushubarbeiten am Grunde eines Schornsteins gefunden wurden,  und die Matrikelkarten der schwedischen Landesaufnahme Pommerns aus den Jahren 1692 bis 1709, in denen das Haus und Grundstück verzeichnet sind. Grundbucheintragungen liegen bis Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderst vor.<br/></p>
<p>Das Haus ist mehrfach umgebaut und gegen 1820 mit einem neuen Dachstuhl versehen worden. Die Sparren, Zangen und Dachlatten sind mit Holznägeln verbunden, Metallnägel handgeschmiedet und gewähren die Verbindung der Gratsparren zum Fachwerk.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<div><img alt=""Schilfrohr wird gebunden"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bfn.de/uploads/pics/dachdecken7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Als ich das Haus 1996 erwarb, bestand die Außenhaut aus Putz. Nach dem Entfernen des Putzes kam erschreckendes zu Tage. Das Fachwerk bestand z.g.T. Nadelholz und war durch und durch verrottet, einzelne Teile aus Eichenbalken, so ein Teil der Schwellen. Das Fachwerk in den Außenwänden war teilweise vollständig entfernt und durch ein Mix von Klinker und Betonsteinen ersetzt worden, eine Hausecke um über einen halben Meter abgesackt.</p>
<p>Einzig das Dach und die Decke mit den Deckenbalken waren i.O.!<br/></p>
<p>Was tun? Wir haben das gesamte Dach einschl. Decke über eine Holzkonstruktion angehoben, sämtliches Fachwerk entfernt, neu fundamentiert und von versierten Zimmerern ein vollständig neues Eichenfachwerk in Handarbeit erstellen und errichten lassen. Ca. 20m^3 Eichenkantholz wurden verarbeitet.</p>
<p>Nun ist das Rohrdach fällig!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/804674/files/20140822064354-IMG_0438.JPG?1408715034"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Für den deutschsprachigen Leser:
Die Herausforderung

Im  Jahr 1996 erwarb ich ein rohrgedecktes Fachwerkhaus in der Nähe von Greifswald, in einer Ortschaft, aus der meine Vorfahren stammen, deren Linie sich bis in das 17. Jahrhundert zurückverfolgen läßt.
Das Haus, bzw. teile seiner Grundsubstanz stammen aus der Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts. Anlass zu dieser Annahme bieten eine schwedische 1/4 Öre Münze mit dem Datum 1635, die bei Aushubarbeiten am Grunde eines Schornsteins gefunden wurden,  und die Matrikelkarten der schwedischen Landesaufnahme Pommerns aus den Jahren 1692 bis 1709, in denen das Haus und Grundstück verzeichnet sind. Grundbucheintragungen liegen bis Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderst vor.
Das Haus ist mehrfach umgebaut und gegen 1820 mit einem neuen Dachstuhl versehen worden. Die Sparren, Zangen und Dachlatten sind mit Holznägeln verbunden, Metallnägel handgeschmiedet und gewähren die Verbindung der Gratsparren zum Fachwerk.



Als ich das Haus 1996 erwarb, bestand die Außenhaut aus Putz. Nach dem Entfernen des Putzes kam erschreckendes zu Tage. Das Fachwerk bestand z.g.T. Nadelholz und war durch und durch verrottet, einzelne Teile aus Eichenbalken, so ein Teil der Schwellen. Das Fachwerk in den Außenwänden war teilweise vollständig entfernt und durch ein Mix von Klinker und Betonsteinen ersetzt worden, eine Hausecke um über einen halben Meter abgesackt.
Einzig das Dach und die Decke mit den Deckenbalken waren i.O.!
Was tun? Wir haben das gesamte Dach einschl. Decke über eine Holzkonstruktion angehoben, sämtliches Fachwerk entfernt, neu fundamentiert und von versierten Zimmerern ein vollständig neues Eichenfachwerk in Handarbeit erstellen und errichten lassen. Ca. 20m^3 Eichenkantholz wurden verarbeitet.
Nun ist das Rohrdach fällig!


Das Rohrdach ist z.g.T. noch mit Haselnussruten gebunden, an den Giebeln wurde als untere Lage des Rohrdachs Stroh verwendet.  Zur Herstellung der Dachlatten hatten sich die früheren Dachdecker aus dem nahe gelegenen Wald bedient und roh behauene Stämme junger Bäume verwendet.Die ältesten Teile des Dachs sind nach Aussagen erfahrener Rohdachdecker sicher über 80 Jahre alt, was für die Qualität der Arbeit und die Eignung des Materials Reet deutlich spricht.


Das Dach ist nun ein einigen Stellen undicht - regnet durch - und der First von Wind und Wetter zerzaust, d.h. das Dach muß dringend neu gedeckt werden.



Reet (auch: Reeth, Reth, Reith, Ried, Riet, Rohr und Ähnliches) bezeichnet das an Ufern oder auf sumpfigem Gelände wachsende Schilfrohr, das vielerorts in getrocknetem Zustand zur Dacheindeckung verwendet wird und in früheren Zeiten zu vielen ähnlichen Zwecken diente, so etwa zum Besticken neuer Deiche mit der Deichnadel.
Der Name Reetdach hat sich bundesweit für diese Eindeckungsform durchgesetzt, mitunter wird sie auch Rohrdach genannt.[1] Ein mit Reet gedecktes Haus wird auch als Reethaus bzw. Reethus bezeichnet.

  Die Unterstützung
Ich benötige nun in finanzieller, und gerne auch ergänzend in tatkräftiger Weise Unterstützung in diesem Vorhaben, da das Rohdach noch dieses Jahr neu gedeckt werden muß.

 

(gebundenes Weichdach: aktueller Zustand)


(genähtes Weichdach: zukünftiger Zustand)
Konkret muss das alte Rohr und die Dachlatten entfernt werden, teilweise verrottete Sparren ersetzt, das Dach neu verlattet und schlussendlich das Reet ""aufgenäht"" werden.


All das geschieht in aufwändiger Handarbeit und wird von lokal ansässigen Rohrdachdeckern ausgeführt.


Da ich auf jegliche Änderungen am Dach verzichte, beispielsweise keine neuen Gauben setzen lassen möchte, beziffern sich die Kosten auf 50.000 EUR.Sollte das Gesamtziel des Fundings von EUR 50.000 nicht errecht werden, so werde ich mich nur in der Lage sehen, kritische Teile des Dachs reparieren zu lassen. 


  Die Folgen 
Die Art des Deckens von Häusern unter der Verwendung von 
Reet/Schilf/Rohr war in Norddeutschland in früheren Zeiten weit

Options include salmon (of course!), halibut, cod, shrimp and more!  Work with us to get your hard to come by favorites at a much higher quality than you can buy from a store while supporting a great cause! We will also send you a logo sticker, custom card, and our salmon recipe.

$ 1,000 - Come experience Cordova first hand! For 2 lucky people this is the trip of a life time! Cordova is well off the beaten Alaskan tourist path. We would put you up in our beautiful lakeside home for 4 days while you hike, paddle, fish, eat fish and explore the Copper River Delta. Perk includes the stay, the food and a car. Airfare to Cordova not included. Date of stay is flexible. We will work with you to find the perfect time! (The following photo is the view from the wall of windows at the lodge!)



How Funds Will Be Used
Funds raised as a part of this campaign will cover:


Purchasing the reusable bags
Shipping bags to Cordova
Cost of stickers (other perks have been donated)
Perks shipping and distribution
Labor costs (volunteer hours are being contributed also)
Campaign costs (Indiegogo fees and credit card fees)



The Impact You Can Help Us Create

Over 1.2 million plastic bags are purchased
and distributed each year by the two largest retail stores in Cordova. With a
population of only 2,500 this means people here use and throw away over 340 plastic
bags per person per year.  

By giving to this project, you will help: 

Keep plastic bags OUT of the Cordova landfill, the land and the sea
Increase support for public policies encouraging the use of reusable bags
Increase public awareness in other regional cities and villages in Alaska about bringing a reusable bag to the store

 Risks & Challenges
 The great news about this campaign is there are vitally no risks to you as a supporter of the campaign -- all perks have been acquired (or are already on order), and our estimated delivery dates are conservative so there is little risk to you there also.
    Other Ways You Can Help Can't contribute? That's ok! There are other ways to get involved:

Make the conscious choice to NOT use a plastic bag when you shop - no matter where you live!
Get behind or start a movement in your community to ban the plastic bag-it's catching on in communities across the nation!
Make some noise! Indiegogo makes sharing this information easy.Tell people what we are doing to help our environment - share on all your social networks!
Follow EPC on facebook & sign up for our newsletter    
We believe that for every cloth bag
we distribute we save countless plastic bags from needing to be produced. This
is a small but important step in lessening the demands on earth’s non
renewable resources.  

Thank you!

<p><i>Some of these long-lasting plastics end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals, and their young, including sea turtles and the black-footed albatross. Midway Atoll receives substantial amounts of marine debris from the patch. Of the 1.5 million Laysan albatrosses that inhabit Midway, nearly all are found to have plastic in their digestive system. Approximately one-third of their chicks die, and many of those deaths are due to being fed plastic from their parents. Twenty tons of plastic debris washes up on Midway every year with five tons of that debris being fed to albatross chicks.</i></p>
<p><i>Besides the particles' danger to wildlife, on the microscopic level the floating debris can absorb organic pollutants from seawater, including PCBs, DDT, and PAHs. Aside from toxic effects, when ingested, some of these are mistaken by the endocrine system as estradiol, causing hormone disruption in the affected animal.

<p><i>Many of these fish are then consumed by humans, resulting in their ingestion of toxic chemicals.</i></p>
</div><div>While recycling is certainly an option, we feel that as a species we need to move towards the principle of 'reduction' we need to curb our consumption habits to change what and how we consume to create real change at scale.

<br/><h3><b>HOW FAR WE’VE COME</b></h3>

<br/><h3>OUR JOURNEY</h3>
<p>In October 2012 we dreamed of a cleaner world, free of plastic waste. We started as activists campaigning to ‘Ban the Bottle’, lobbying the Pondicherry government to ban the sale of packaged drinking water. Our friends in local social and ecological organisations urged us to create viable alternatives before pursuing action through policy.</p>
<p>A few months later we sat down to design a simple solution that filtered water on site, tested water quality in real-time and allowed a shopkeeper to sell water to consumers bringing their own bottles.We started with a stand-alone water kiosk.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1136002/files/20150107035901-kiosk_fotos_for_indiegogo_campaign.jpg?1420631941"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In August 2013, our co-founder and CEO Min, was selected to be part of Villgro’s Entrepreneur-in-residence programme. Their guidance finely tuned our operations to be more dynamic and we applied the structural principles of a lean startup: conducting continuous experiments in the field to gain insight into consumer and the market to perfect the product long before its launch.</p>

</div></div>","We are Hamilton Energy Recovery Action Group 
We are raising money for our campaign opposing the proposed incinerator that is planned for a site that borders Hamilton, Bothwell and Blantyre.
The proposed incinerator will emit large toxic particles that are predicted to fall within a 600 metre radius and small toxic particles that may travel up to 18 Kilometers from the site. Within the 600 metre radius are hundreds of houses, a primary school and a “Showpeople/Traveller” residential site. There is a guideline minimum of 250 metres to any home from these types of Incinerators, the Showpeople site would be 83 metres door to door, in fact fenceline to fenceline the gap is only 12 metres. 

As well as the toxins we have other concerns: 



Potential contamination to adjacent Woodland and it's wildlife


Site proximity to a “Green Corridor” that runs from the Clyde Valley past the site and further towards Glasgow

Smell 
Noise
Potential for uncontrolled fires 

Proximity to a Historic battlefield site (Battle of Bothwell Bridge).


We can stop this happening, protect our environment and safeguard the health of our community. In doing so we will also send a clear message to those planning other such developments happening across the country.  
   What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise three thousand pounds to fund our campaign against the granting of a SEPA operator's licence to Clean Power Ltd. Our campaign is growing in size every week and we require this funding to continue. Funds raised will be spent on marketing and awareness products, travel, media submissions and general administration.
We are offering perks for contributions received, every single contribution regardless of size will receive a thank you. 
We will also be:


Giving thank you ""shout outs"" on social media
Emailing certificates as acknowledgement of contributions 
Sending out our bespoke campaign badge designed by the children of our community

Providing a ""blog spot"" on our site, so people can have a chance to describe what they are feeling and thinking as the campaign moves forward.  


   Why this is relevant to you


This campaign is relevant to everyone. The incinerator poses a health threat to anyone you may know in the area around where the site is planned. In the wider context this campaign demonstrates that communities can come together for a common purpose and fight against faceless big business who have no concern for the environment we live in. 

Our Team
We have support from many different people. We have campaigners who successfully stopped another Incinerator that was planned in the area. We have MSPs and Councillors who have let their objection be known and regularly attend our meetings. Hamilton Accies Football Club Community Outreach Program is providing support. We have Professors, Professionals of various disciplines and a whole load of very passionate people determined to stop this Incinerator from happening.

We are organised, we have different subgroups pursuing different aspects of our campaign. Were having regular meetings, progress reports and issue reports. The Fundraising subgroup have put this Crowd Funding page together with the aim of supporting everyone else in a successful campaign.
   Risks & Challenges The planning consent was granted for the incinerator to Clean Power Ltd on the 14th August this year. The company have three years to get their operators licence, build the facility and put everything in place. 
In fighting the operators license we have potentially a long campaign ahead that will take a lot of energy and resolve. We will continue growing our number of supporters online and at grass roots level. Being appropriately funded, organised and focused we will see this through.

Our rescue organization has no building and no business hours. It is a group of volunteers who we call DogSpot Team or just, simply, DogSpot Family.

Complicated surgeries, computed tomography, high quality food for treatment of various issues... It is quite clear, why we still donʾt have a place, a spot, where to stay with our dogs.</p><p>An important point of our practice – spay neuter procedures, as this is the only way to control the population of the stray dogs and to prevent the exploitation of mix breed flat-nosed dogs.<br/>We also address emotional and behavioral issues.</p><p>About 80 percent of our flat-nosed dogs are seriously neglected and abused, so their preparation for the new home can take from 3 to 6 months.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543779102/mdtcay17cgtqphwxbpvo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>ADOPTION</strong><br/>DogSpot it is not an animal shelter where a potential adopter can drop by, choose a dog and take it home.

We have noticed that in this environment our dogs feel just great! More space for playing in the yard, fresh air, nature, more activities, movement, more opportunities to implement rehabilitation steps.</p><p>Since we started we have rescued 345 dogs, most of them came from horrible conditions (usually – puppy mills), left outside, covered in dirt, fleas, malnourished, exhausted, abused, scared of their own shadow.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543779316/bub6fxa2obvgblnxyu3t.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>SO WHAT IS THE BIG DREAM?</strong><br/>We have been working with abandoned and neglected flat-nosed dogs for five years already. We have no holidays, no weekends, no time to say “NO” or “THE END”. As our helping hands are a big BEGINNING of something new, something amazing for the dogs, who had never felt the breeze of fresh air, who had never experienced the touch of green grass and who never imagined their life could be different than cage, neglect, abuse and one pregnancy after another...</p><p>Our dream is to establish our own DogSpot Village. A rehabilitation place, center, for our fostered flat-nosed dogs and other dogs who experienced traumas. It is our dream for such a long time... Maybe it is time to make this dream come true?</p><p>Homestead or DogSpot Village would allow to accept more unnecessary dogs, to make our work more efficient. It would be a place of our own. No rents, not temporary premises. Our fostered dogs would be completely safe and we would be able to work with less stress. It would be a place for all those, who arenʾt able to find their true homes because of their age, illnesses or health pathologies.</p><p><strong>Help us make this DREAM come true and become the superheroes of the flat-noses!</strong></p><p><strong>VISION OF THE REHABILITATION SPOT</strong><br/>The main point of the rehabilitation center is to create space, conditions and means for the more efficient rehabilitation of our fostered dogs.</p><p>We are planning to establish a rehabilitation zone with treadmill, stability balls, stimulating mats and other dog gym equipment. On the same floor a place for quarantine is foreseen, a cabinet for procedures (for example, for massage, light therapy, acupuncture and electrostimulation with NeuroTrac TENS machines) and a dog bath tub.</p><p>All our fostered flat-noses would live in the rooms specially designed and arranged for them. Also we would have a general space (living room) with kitchen.</p><p>Outdoor area would be used for a swimming pool, as water procedures (hydrotherapy) are in particular useful for the dogs after spinal and knee-cap surgeries. Also it would be a great activity for our beloved senior fostered dogs – swimming is highly beneficial for older dogs both for strengthening of muscles and treatment of arthritis. As we are cooperating with dog training schools, our own space would allow arranging joined lessons for our fostered dogs in order to help cope them with fears and to solve their behavior issues more efficiently.</p><p>We have a lot of experience in the field of canine rehabilitation. We know, how obtain high level results even with the use of quite “domestic” measures. <strong>Can you imagine what we would be able to do if we had the specialized and equipped place – DogSpot rehabilitation center?</strong></p><p><strong>*************************</strong></p><p><strong>KAS MES ESAME?</strong><br/>DogSpotas yra ne pelno siekianti organizacija arba, kaip save vadiname, suplotasnukių gelbėtojai.<br/>Mūsų misija – ištiesti pagalbos ranką bei surasti naujus namus benamiams suplotasnukiams (prancūzų buldogams, anglų buldogams, mopsams, pekinams, bokseriams bei šių veislių mišrūnams) ir kitiems likimo nuskriaustiems šunims, kurie dėl ligų, negalios, patirtų traumų ar kitų priežasčių tapo nereikalingi, atsidūrė gatvėje arba sanitarinėse tarnybose.</p><p><strong>MŪSŲ „KLIENTAI“</strong><br/>Dalies DogSpoto globojamų suplotasnukių atsisako šeimininkai. Vieni į globą atkeliauja iš vietinių sanitarinių tarnybų, kitus žmonės tiesiog palieka veterinarinėse klinikose.</p><p>Deja, didžiausia globotinių dalis (apie 70 proc.) – buvę daugyklų „gyventojai“ ir „darbuotojai“. Išnaudoti, išsunkti, atrodytų, iki paskutinio lašo.</p><p>Šunų daugykla yra vieta, kurioje visas dėmesys skiriamas kuo didesniam pelnui. Kuo mažesnės išlaidos dauginamiems gyvūnams – tuo didesnis pelnas lieka daugintojui. Natūralu, gyvūnų sveikata ir gerovė šioje grandyje lieka paskutinėje vietoje. Kalės yra kergiamos per kiekvieną rują, pradedant nuo labai ankstyvo amžiaus (pirmosios rujos). Rujoms padažninti kalėms leidžiami hormonai. Joms ne tik nepakanka laiko atgauti jėgas tarp vadų, bet dėl prastų laikymo sąlygų, skurdžios mitybos bei patiriamo streso, jos gana per trumpą laiką tampa nebetinkamos veisimui, todėl yra užmigdomos arba nužudomos kitais būdais.</p><p>Daugyklose šunys didžiąją laiko dalį dažniausiai praleidžia ankštuose narvuose, tvartuose arba voljeruose Narvuose laikomi šunys yra priversti vaikščioti vielinėmis grotomis, kurios žaloja ir<br/>deformuoja letenas. Nesulaukę reikiamos veterinarinės pagalbos bei priežiūros daugyklų „gyventojai“ kenčia nuo ausų infekcijų, įvairių odos ligų, dehidratacijos, mažakraujystės, akių opų bei ragenų uždegimų, kurie negydomi priveda iki aklumo.</p><p>Pirkėjai, norintys kuo pigiau įsigyti į vieną ar kitą veislę panašų šunelį, sukuria paklausą, kurią daugintojai siekia patenkinti. Nedaugelis susimąsto, kad „pigesnis“ šuniukas turi savo kainą. Ir ji – labai didelė. Tai daugyklose kankinamos kalės ir reproduktoriai, kurie visą gyvenimą praleidžia ankštame narve, prieblandoje, baisioje smarvėje, niekada nevedžiojami, neglostomi, dažnai gulintys savo šlapime ir išmatose.</p><p>Mūsų užduotis ne tik gydyti ir reabilituoti jų suluošintus kūnus. Mūsų tikslas – išmokyti juos vėl patikėti žmogumi. Mūsų misija – suteikti jiems naują gyvenimą, kurio jie yra daugiau, nei verti.</p><p><strong>PAGRINDINIAI VEIKLOS PRINCIPAI</strong><br/>DogSpoto organizacija yra tik laikina stotelė tarp šuns buvusio gyvenimo ir naujojo gyvenimo tikruose namuose. Mūsų organizacija neturi būstinės, mes neturime nustatytų darbo valandų. Mes turime šaunių savanorių, kuriuos vadiname DogSpoto komanda arba, tiesiog DogSpoto šeima. Šiuo metu mūsų savanorių ir globėjų namų tinklas apima įvairius Lietuvos kampelius, tačiau pagrindinės atstovybės yra Vilniuje, Kaune, Šiauliuose ir Klaipėdoje.</p><p>Mūsų organizacijoje gyvūnams nėra taikoma eutanazija ir mes niekada nenusigręžiame bei nesakome „NE“ suplotasnukiui, kuriam reikia pagalbos, dėl jo ligų, medicininių poreikių ar amžiaus.</p><p><strong>VETERINARINĖ PRIEŽIŪRA</strong><br/>Savo globotiniams užtikriname reikiamą veterinarinę priežiūrą bei gydymą. Globotiniams atliekamos apžiūros, kraujo tyrimai, jie nukirminami, skiepijami, ženklinami. Tai tik dalis visiems atliekamų procedūrų – būtent veterinarinės išlaidos sudaro didžiausią mūsų sąnaudų dalį.<br/>Labai dažnai globotiniams prireikia sudėtingų operacijų, kompiuterinės tomografijos tyrimų, kokybiškų gydomųjų pašarų ir kitų procedūrų.Būtent veterinarinės išlaidos sudaro didžiausią mūsų sąnaudų dalį.</p><p>Labai svarbus aspektas mūsų veikloje – sterilizacija ir kastracija. Tai vienintelis būdas kontroliuoti beglobių gyvūnų populiaciją bei užkirsti kelią į vieną ar kitą veislę panašių gyvūnų išnaudojimui.</p><p>Didelį dėmesį skiriame globotinių emociniams poreikiams bei elgsenos problemoms.<br/>Apie 80 procentų mūsų globojamų suplotasnukių yra smarkiai neprižiūrėti ir apleisti, taigi jų paruošimas į naujus namus gali užtrukti nuo 3 iki 6 mėnesių.</p><p><strong>NAMŲ SUTEIKIMAS</strong><br/>DogSpotas nėra įprasta gyvūnų prieglauda, į kurią atvykę norėtojai gali išsirinkti šunį ir parsivežti jį namo. Potencialūs „norėtojai“ yra kruopščiai atrenkami ir privalo atitikti tam tikrus kriterijus. Tokiu būdu siekiame savo globotiniams surasti pačius geriausius namus. Mūsų tikslas – tinkamiems norėtojams surasti jiems tobulai tinkamą globotinį. Mes norime būti visiškai tikri, kad dėl nekokybiško dovanojimo daug praeityje kentėję suplotasnukiai vėl nebūtų išduoti, neprižiūrimi ar kitaip skriaudžiami.</p><p><strong>AUKOJIMAS</strong><br/>Kadangi DogSpotas yra ne pelno siekianti viešoji įstaiga, už didžiąją veiklai reikalingą lėšų dalį esame dėkingi paprastiems žmonėms. Priešingai nei daugelis galvoja, valstybė nefinansuoja gyvūnų prieglaudų ir gyvūnų gerovės organizacijų veiklų. Pagrindiniai aukotojai yra gyventojai bei įmonės, taip pat reikiamų lėšų pavyksta surinkti įvairių renginių (pavyzdžiui, Kalėdinės mugės beglobiams paremti) bei pavienių žmonių iniciatyvumo dėka. Didelė finansinė paspirtis – 2 proc. nuo GPM parama, kurią gauname kartą per metus.</p><p>Prisidėti prie DogSpoto veiklos galima įvairiausiais būdais: galite skirti savo laiką, įgūdžius, užsiimti laikina globa arba skirti norimo dydžio auką (mažų aukų – nėra).</p><p>Jūsų aukos padės mums užtikrinti tinkamą globotinių priežiūrą bei gydymą, kurio kaina neretai siekia įspūdingas sumas. Ar žinojote, kad vidutinės išlaidos, kurių prireikia norint paruošti vieną mūsų globotinį išvykimui į naujus namus, siekia apie penkis šimtus eurų?</p><p>Nepaisant mūsų gelbėjimo veiklos išlaidų, Jums nereikės mokėti jokių mokesčių norint į savo šeimą priimti DogSpoto globotinį.</p><p>Mes esame tikri, kad geriausia „auka“ ar „dovana“ yra NAUJI ir TIKRI namai mūsų išglobotam suplotasnukiui. Nepriklausomai nuo jo amžiaus, išvaizdos ir sveikatos ypatumų.</p><p><strong>KAIP MES DIRBAME?</strong><br/>Visus ketverius metus dirbome namų globų tinklo principu. Tai reiškia, kad mes nesame ir nelaikome savęs įprasta šunų prieglauda. Mes manome, kad tinkama mūsų globotinių priežiūra yra įmanoma tik namų sąlygomis, todėl stengiamės tai suteikti ir užtikrinti visiems savo globotiniams. Tai leidžia mums ne tik kokybiškai išslaugyti, reabilituoti globotinį, bet ir pasirūpinti jo psichologinėmis reikmėmis, socializacija, dresūra.</p><p>Jau trejus metus, kiekvieną vasarą mažiausiai 4-5 mėnesius praleidžiame nuomojamoje sodyboje, kurią vadiname DogSpoto Kaimu. Tačiau globotinių laikymo standartai čia nesikeičia – šunys gyvena kambariukuose, taigi jų laikymo sąlygos labiau primena laikinus namus. Pastebėjome, kad sodyboje šunys jaučiasi ypač gerai – daugiau laisvės judėti, gamta, grynas oras, daugiau veiklos, aktyvumo, daugiau galimybių užsiimti mankštomis bei reabilitacija baseine.</p><p><strong>TAI KOKIA TA MŪSŲ DIDŽIOJI SVAJONĖ?</strong><br/>Jau ketvirti metai be atokvėpio dirbame ir gelbėjame likimo nuskriaustus suplotasnukius. Vieni kitus paremdami, padrąsindami ir palaikydami. Apie nuosavą DogSpoto Kaimą, apie reabilitacijos centrą globojamiems suplotasnukiams bei kitiems traumas patyrusiems šunims svajojame jau seniai. Galbūt atėjo laikas šiai svajonei išsipildyti?</p><p>Sodyba arba DogSpoto kaimas leistų mums be streso priimti daugiau globotinių, kokybiškiau juos globoti ir reabilituoti. Tai būtų vieta, kurioje nebūtume svečiai, nebūtume nuomininkai. Tai būtų saugi užuovėja ir prieglobstis mūsų globotiniams. Tai būtų vieta, kurioje jiems skirtą laiką nugyventų visi globotiniai, kurie taip ir nerado namų dėl savo amžiaus, ligų ar patologijų.<br/>Padėkite svajonei išsipildyti ir tapkite suplotasnukių superherojais!</p><p><strong>REABILITACIJOS CENTRO VIZIJA</strong><br/>Reabilitacijos centro esmė – sukurti erdvę, sąlygas bei priemones efektyvesniam globotinių reabilitavimui.</p><p>Planuojama reabilitacijos zona su bėgimo takeliu, balansiniais kamuoliais, stimuliuojančiais kilimėliais ir kitomis šunų mankštai reikalingomis priemonėmis. Tame pačiame aukšte planuojama karantino vieta, procedūrų kabinetas (pavyzdžiui, masažo, šviesox terapijos, akupunktūros, elektrostimuliacijos procedūroms), gyvūnų maudymui skirta vonia.</p><p>Visi šunys gyventų specialiai jiems skirtuose, pagal poreikius pritaikytuose kambariuose. Taip pat būtų suformuota bendra zona (svetainė) su virtuve.</p><p>Lauke būtų įrengtas baseinas. Vandens procedūros (hidroterapija) ypatingai naudingos šunims po stuburo išvaržų, girnelių operacijų, o taip pat pasitarnautų senjorų raumenų stiprinimui. Kadangi bendradarbiaujame su dresūros mokyklomis, turėdami savo kiemą galėtume rengti jungtines dresūros pamokas savo globotiniams, padėti įveikti jiems savo baimes ir efektyviau spręsti elgsenos problemas.</p><p>Reabilitacijos srityje turime tikrai daug patirties. Žinome, kaip pasiekti ypač gerą rezultatą naudojant, atrodytų, gana „buitines“ priemones. Tik pagalvokite, ką galėtume nuveikti, jeigu turėtume tam skirtą ir pritaikytą vietą – DogSpoto reabilitacijos centrą.</p></div>","WHO WE AREDogSpot is a non-profit organization or, how we are used to call ourselves – the rescuers of the flat-nosed dogs.Our mission – come to the aid of homeless or abandoned French bulldogs, Pugs, English bulldogs, Pekingeses and Boxers (the most commonly – to the mixes of these breeds) and other unfortunate dogs.

Life which they are more than worth of.THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF OUR WORKDogSpot is a rescue organization that acts as a bridge between a dog’s past life and its future forever home. Our rescue organization has no building and no business hours. It is a group of volunteers who we call DogSpot Team or just, simply, DogSpot Family. Currently our network of volunteers and foster homes spreads all over Lithuania, but the main “spots” are located in Vilnius, Kaunas, Siauliai and Klaipeda Cities.We are a no-kill rescue and never turn away any flat-nosed dog due to illness, medical needs or age. VETERINARY CAREWe provide necessary veterinary treatment including vet exams, blood tests, deworming, protection from fleas and ticks, vaccination, spay/neuter procedures, microchipping and dental care as basic medical care for our dogs. This is just a small part of the whole medical care services our dogs get. So it is no surprise that costs for veterinary services make the largest part of our expenses. Complicated surgeries, computed tomography, high quality food for treatment of various issues... It is quite clear, why we still donʾt have a place, a spot, where to stay with our dogs.An important point of our practice – spay neuter procedures, as this is the only way to control the population of the stray dogs and to prevent the exploitation of mix breed flat-nosed dogs.We also address emotional and behavioral issues.About 80 percent of our flat-nosed dogs are seriously neglected and abused, so their preparation for the new home can take from 3 to 6 months.ADOPTIONDogSpot it is not an animal shelter where a potential adopter can drop by, choose a dog and take it home. Potential adopters are carefully checked and must pass the particular process of selecting the best option for our fostered dogs as a future home. We want to be absolutely sure that our fostered dogs, who have suffered so much already in the past, donʾt wind up back in rescue and have to undergo the process again because of an inappropriate adoption.DONATIONSAs a non-profit organization, we rely on donations from the community. Contrary to the thinking of common people, we don’t obtain any state funding. The main donations reach us from the community (the citizens), some enterprises / companies or through fund-raising campaigns (like Christmas Fair, our organized events, initiatives of other kind people and similar).There are many ways in which you can donate to DogSpot, be it with your time, your skills, adopting, fostering or by making a financial donation.Your donations will help us provide the necessary medical care that many our foster dogs so dearly need. Did you know that the average medical bill for our fostered flat-nosed dog before they are ready for re-homing is in average about five hundred euros?Despite the costs of our rescue activity, there is no adoption fee for our adopted dog. We believe that the best “donation” or “gift”, doesn’t matter, how we call it – is a new and real HOME for all our fostered dog, regardless of their age, appearance or remaining health issues.HOW DO WE DO ITAll our work is based on the network of temporary fostering homes. This means that we arenʾt and we donʾt see ourselves as a common or traditional shelter. In our opinion the appropriate fostering and care of our fostered flat-nosed dogs is possible only under home-like conditions. Therefore it is our main way of care and rehabilitation.For already 4 years we have been spending at least 4-5 months at the rented homestead near Vilnius, which we are calling DogSpot Village. But the standards of keeping our fostered dogs here also remain the same – dogs live in their rooms, they have every possibility to spend their time free and without any space restrictions (for example, cages). We have noticed that in this environment our dogs feel just great! More space for playing in the yard, fresh air, nature, more activities, movement, more opportunities to implement rehabilitation steps.Since we started we have rescued 345 dogs, most of them came from horrible conditions (usually – puppy mills), left outside, covered in dirt, fleas, malnourished, exhausted, abused, scared of their own shadow.SO WHAT IS THE BIG DREAM?We have been working with abandoned and neglected flat-nosed dogs for five years already. We have no holidays, no weekends, no time to say “NO” or “THE END”. As our helping hands are a big BEGINNING of something new, something amazing for the dogs, who had never felt the breeze of fresh air, who had never experienced the touch of green grass and who never imagined their life could be different than cage, neglect, abuse and one pregnancy after another...Our dream is to establish our own DogSpot Village. A rehabilitation place, center, for our fostered flat-nosed dogs and other dogs who experienced traumas. It is our dream for such a long time... Maybe it is time to make this dream come true?Homestead or DogSpot Village would allow to accept more unnecessary dogs, to make our work more efficient. It would be a place of our own. No rents, not temporary premises. Our fostered dogs would be completely safe and we would be able to work with less stress. It would be a place for all those, who arenʾt able to find their true homes because of their age, illnesses or health pathologies.Help us make this DREAM come true and become the superheroes of the flat-noses!VISION OF THE REHABILITATION SPOTThe main point of the rehabilitation center is to create space, conditions and means for the more efficient rehabilitation of our fostered dogs.We are planning to establish a rehabilitation zone with treadmill, stability balls, stimulating mats and other dog gym equipment. On the same floor a place for quarantine is foreseen, a cabinet for procedures (for example, for massage, light therapy, acupuncture and electrostimulation with NeuroTrac TENS machines) and a dog bath tub.All our fostered flat-noses would live in the rooms specially designed and arranged for them. Also we would have a general space (living room) with kitchen.Outdoor area would be used for a swimming pool, as water procedures (hydrotherapy) are in particular useful for the dogs after spinal and knee-cap surgeries. Also it would be a great activity for our beloved senior fostered dogs – swimming is highly beneficial for older dogs both for strengthening of muscles and treatment of arthritis. As we are cooperating with dog training schools, our own space would allow arranging joined lessons for our fostered dogs in order to help cope them with fears and to solve their behavior issues more efficiently.We have a lot of experience in the field of canine rehabilitation. We know, how obtain high level results even with the use of quite “domestic” measures. Can you imagine what we would be able to do if we had the specialized and equipped place – DogSpot rehabilitation center?*************************KAS MES ESAME?DogSpotas yra ne pelno siekianti organizacija arba, kaip save vadiname, suplotasnukių gelbėtojai.Mūsų misija – ištiesti pagalbos ranką bei surasti naujus namus benamiams suplotasnukiams (prancūzų buldogams, anglų buldogams, mopsams, pekinams, bokseriams bei šių veislių mišrūnams) ir kitiems likimo nuskriaustiems šunims, kurie dėl ligų, negalios, patirtų traumų ar kitų priežasčių tapo nereikalingi, atsidūrė gatvėje arba sanitarinėse tarnybose.MŪSŲ „KLIENTAI“Dalies DogSpoto globojamų suplotasnukių atsisako šeimininkai. Vieni į globą atkeliauja iš vietinių sanitarinių tarnybų, kitus žmonės tiesiog palieka veterinarinėse klinikose.Deja, didžiausia globotinių dalis (apie 70 proc.) – buvę daugyklų „gyventojai“ ir „darbuotojai“. Išnaudoti, išsunkti, atrodytų, iki paskutinio lašo.Šunų daugykla yra vieta, kurioje visas dėmesys skiriamas kuo didesniam pelnui. Kuo mažesnės išlaidos dauginamiems gyvūnams – tuo didesnis pelnas lieka daugintojui. Natūralu, gyvūnų sveikata ir gerovė šioje grandyje lieka paskutinėje vietoje. Kalės yra kergiamos per kiekvieną rują, pradedant nuo labai ankstyvo amžiaus (pirmosios rujos). Rujoms padažninti kalėms leidžiami hormonai. Joms ne tik nepakanka laiko atgauti jėgas tarp vadų, bet dėl prastų laikymo sąlygų, skurdžios mitybos bei patiriamo streso, jos gana per trumpą laiką tampa nebetinkamos veisimui, todėl yra užmigdomos arba nužudomos kitais būdais.Daugyklose šunys didžiąją laiko dalį dažniausiai praleidžia ankštuose narvuose, tvartuose arba voljeruose Narvuose laikomi šunys yra priversti vaikščioti vielinėmis grotomis, kurios žaloja irdeformuoja letenas. Nesulaukę reikiamos veterinarinės pagalbos bei priežiūros daugyklų „gyventojai“ kenčia nuo ausų infekcijų, įvairių odos ligų, dehidratacijos, mažakraujystės, akių opų bei ragenų uždegimų, kurie negydomi priveda iki aklumo.Pirkėjai, norintys kuo pigiau įsigyti į vieną ar kitą veislę panašų šunelį, sukuria paklausą, kurią daugintojai siekia patenkinti. Nedaugelis susimąsto, kad „pigesnis“ šuniukas turi savo kainą. Ir ji – labai didelė. Tai daugyklose kankinamos kalės ir reproduktoriai, kurie visą gyvenimą praleidžia ankštame narve, prieblandoje, baisioje smarvėje, niekada nevedžiojami, neglostomi, dažnai gulintys savo šlapime ir išmatose.Mūsų užduotis ne tik gydyti ir reabilituoti jų suluošintus kūnus. Mūsų tikslas – išmokyti juos vėl patikėti žmogumi. Mūsų misija – suteikti jiems naują gyvenimą, kurio jie yra daugiau, nei verti.PAGRINDINIAI VEIKLOS PRINCIPAIDogSpoto organizacija yra tik laikina stotelė tarp šuns buvusio gyvenimo ir naujojo gyvenimo tikruose namuose. Mūsų organizacija neturi būstinės, mes neturime nustatytų darbo valandų. Mes turime šaunių savanorių, kuriuos vadiname DogSpoto komanda arba, tiesiog DogSpoto šeima. Šiuo metu mūsų savanorių ir globėjų namų tinklas apima įvairius Lietuvos kampelius, tačiau pagrindinės atstovybės yra Vilniuje, Kaune, Šiauliuose ir Klaipėdoje.Mūsų organizacijoje gyvūnams nėra taikoma eutanazija ir mes niekada nenusigręžiame bei nesakome „NE“ suplotasnukiui, kuriam reikia pagalbos, dėl jo ligų, medicininių poreikių ar amžiaus.VETERINARINĖ PRIEŽIŪRASavo globotiniams užtikriname reikiamą veterinarinę priežiūrą bei gydymą. Globotiniams atliekamos apžiūros, kraujo tyrimai, jie nukirminami, skiepijami, ženklinami. Tai tik dalis visiems atliekamų procedūrų – būtent veterinarinės išlaidos sudaro didžiausią mūsų sąnaudų dalį.Labai dažnai globotiniams prireikia sudėtingų operacijų, kompiuterinės tomografijos tyrimų, kokybiškų gydomųjų pašarų ir kitų procedūrų.Būtent veterinarinės išlaidos sudaro didžiausią mūsų sąnaudų dalį.Labai svarbus aspektas mūsų veikloje – sterilizacija ir kastracija. Tai vienintelis būdas kontroliuoti beglobių gyvūnų populiaciją bei užkirsti kelią į vieną ar kitą veislę panašių gyvūnų išnaudojimui.Didelį dėmesį skiriame globotinių emociniams poreikiams bei elgsenos problemoms.Apie 80 procentų mūsų globojamų suplotasnukių yra smarkiai neprižiūrėti ir apleisti, taigi jų paruošimas į naujus namus gali užtrukti nuo 3 iki 6 mėnesių.NAMŲ SUTEIKIMASDogSpotas nėra įprasta gyvūnų prieglauda, į kurią atvykę norėtojai gali išsirinkti šunį ir parsivežti jį namo. Potencialūs „norėtojai“ yra kruopščiai atrenkami ir privalo atitikti tam tikrus kriterijus. Tokiu būdu siekiame savo globotiniams surasti pačius geriausius namus. Mūsų tikslas – tinkamiems norėtojams surasti jiems tobulai tinkamą globotinį. Mes norime būti visiškai tikri, kad dėl nekokybiško dovanojimo daug praeityje kentėję suplotasnukiai vėl nebūtų išduoti, neprižiūrimi ar kitaip skriaudžiami.AUKOJIMASKadangi DogSpotas yra ne pelno siekianti viešoji įstaiga, už didžiąją veiklai reikalingą lėšų dalį esame dėkingi paprastiems žmonėms. Priešingai nei daugelis galvoja, valstybė nefinansuoja gyvūnų prieglaudų ir gyvūnų gerovės organizacijų veiklų. Pagrindiniai aukotojai yra gyventojai bei įmonės, taip pat reikiamų lėšų pavyksta surinkti įvairių renginių (pavyzdžiui, Kalėdinės mugės beglobiams paremti) bei pavienių žmonių iniciatyvumo dėka. Didelė finansinė paspirtis – 2 proc. nuo GPM parama, kurią gauname kartą per metus.Prisidėti prie DogSpoto veiklos galima įvairiausiais būdais: galite skirti savo laiką, įgūdžius, užsiimti laikina globa arba skirti norimo dydžio auką (mažų aukų – nėra).Jūsų aukos padės mums užtikrinti tinkamą globotinių priežiūrą bei gydymą, kurio kaina neretai siekia įspūdingas sumas. Ar žinojote, kad vidutinės išlaidos, kurių prireikia norint paruošti vieną mūsų globotinį išvykimui į naujus namus, siekia apie penkis šimtus eurų?Nepaisant mūsų gelbėjimo veiklos išlaidų, Jums nereikės mokėti jokių mokesčių norint į savo šeimą priimti DogSpoto globotinį.Mes esame tikri, kad geriausia „auka“ ar „dovana“ yra NAUJI ir TIKRI namai mūsų išglobotam suplotasnukiui. Nepriklausomai nuo jo amžiaus, išvaizdos ir sveikatos ypatumų.KAIP MES DIRBAME?Visus ketverius metus dirbome namų globų tinklo principu. Tai reiškia, kad mes nesame ir nelaikome savęs įprasta šunų prieglauda. Mes manome, kad tinkama mūsų globotinių priežiūra yra įmanoma tik namų sąlygomis, todėl stengiamės tai suteikti ir užtikrinti visiems savo globotiniams. Tai leidžia mums ne tik kokybiškai išslaugyti, reabilituoti globotinį, bet ir pasirūpinti jo psichologinėmis reikmėmis, socializacija, dresūra.Jau trejus metus, kiekvieną vasarą mažiausiai 4-5 mėnesius praleidžiame nuomojamoje sodyboje, kurią vadiname DogSpoto Kaimu. Tačiau globotinių laikymo standartai čia nesikeičia – šunys gyvena kambariukuose, taigi jų laikymo sąlygos labiau primena laikinus namus. Pastebėjome, kad sodyboje šunys jaučiasi ypač gerai – daugiau laisvės judėti, gamta, grynas oras, daugiau veiklos, aktyvumo, daugiau galimybių užsiimti mankštomis bei reabilitacija baseine.TAI KOKIA TA MŪSŲ DIDŽIOJI SVAJONĖ?Jau ketvirti metai be atokvėpio dirbame ir gelbėjame likimo nuskriaustus suplotasnukius. Vieni kitus paremdami, padrąsindami ir palaikydami. Apie nuosavą DogSpoto Kaimą, apie reabilitacijos centrą globojamiems suplotasnukiams bei kitiems traumas patyrusiems šunims svajojame jau seniai. Galbūt atėjo laikas šiai svajonei išsipildyti?Sodyba arba DogSpoto kaimas leistų mums be streso priimti daugiau globotinių, kokybiškiau juos globoti ir reabilituoti. Tai būtų vieta, kurioje nebūtume svečiai, nebūtume nuomininkai. Tai būtų saugi užuovėja ir prieglobstis mūsų globotiniams. Tai būtų vieta, kurioje jiems skirtą laiką nugyventų visi globotiniai, kurie taip ir nerado namų dėl savo amžiaus, ligų ar patologijų.Padėkite svajonei išsipildyti ir tapkite suplotasnukių superherojais!REABILITACIJOS CENTRO VIZIJAReabilitacijos centro esmė – sukurti erdvę, sąlygas bei priemones efektyvesniam globotinių reabilitavimui.Planuojama reabilitacijos zona su bėgimo takeliu, balansiniais kamuoliais, stimuliuojančiais kilimėliais ir kitomis šunų mankštai reikalingomis priemonėmis. Tame pačiame aukšte planuojama karantino vieta, procedūrų kabinetas (pavyzdžiui, masažo, šviesox terapijos, akupunktūros, elektrostimuliacijos procedūroms), gyvūnų maudymui skirta vonia.Visi šunys gyventų specialiai jiems skirtuose, pagal poreikius pritaikytuose kambariuose. Taip pat būtų suformuota bendra zona (svetainė) su virtuve.Lauke būtų įrengtas baseinas. Vandens procedūros (hidroterapija) ypatingai naudingos šunims po stuburo išvaržų, girnelių operacijų, o taip pat pasitarnautų senjorų raumenų stiprinimui. Kadangi bendradarbiaujame su dresūros mokyklomis, turėdami savo kiemą galėtume rengti jungtines dresūros pamokas savo globotiniams, padėti įveikti jiems savo baimes ir efektyviau spręsti elgsenos problemas.Reabilitacijos srityje turime tikrai daug patirties. Žinome, kaip pasiekti ypač gerą rezultatą naudojant, atrodytų, gana „buitines“ priemones. Tik pagalvokite, ką galėtume nuveikti, jeigu turėtume tam skirtą ir pritaikytą vietą – DogSpoto reabilitacijos centrą.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are a group of young enthusiasts from Serbia,who want their ideas and projects to change the way of thinking in humans and show how are a healthy environment and the nature important things for humans.We want to make the world a better place through various projects and fundraising campaigns.Help us improve the world,one project at the time.I am Dragoljub Milankov.Our team is currently small,but day by day it's becoming bigger,and our ideas are becoming more serious.    What is that""Tisa Mayfly""?
Unique world phenomenon THE FLOWER OF TISA(Palingenia Longicauda)The Tisa Mayfly (Palingenia longicauda) is the largest mayfly species in Europe,males measuring up to 12 cm (5 inches) from head to tail.This long-tailed mayflies are aquatic insects which belong to the Ephemeroptera order.Their larval stage usually lasts three years.The adults are short-lived: once fully matured,they have roughly three hours to mate and then die.Male Tisa Mayflies are unique among the winged insects in that they molt one more time after acquiring functional wings.This second-to-last winged instar is usually a matter of minutes.Tisa’s flower is an ancient insect species.Ascendants of this species emerged some 200 million years ago. Unlike many other species of mayflies, adult P.longicauda never move away from water;they fly low and their cerci are frequently touching or sweeping the surface.The slow-moving river and absence of surface-feeding fish help make this possible.The presence of P. longicauda is an indicator of clean unpolluted water. Now extinct in many European countries,it can be found in Serbia and Hungary on the Tisza river,as well as in Romania, About this phenomenonThis is rare scene, wedding dance above Tisa River. Only few days in June every year (even not every year),beautiful insect Tisa's flower or Tisa mayflies (Palingenia longicauda) are being born, making love and die.After three hours,everything is finished.Palingenia longicauda doesn't have mouth because it doesn't eat - it just makes love and dies, during his short but beautiful life. This is realy amazing scene and it is very hard to show it by photo or words...It is possible to enjoy one of the most beautiful natural phenomenons in the world that lasts only five days in early June. Thousands of yellow insects fly in fervor just above the river surface conjuring the creation of the universe.The Tisa flower lives for three years at the bottom of the river.It very well represents the essence of nature's imagination,which is for only a few hours perfectly reflected in the passion of these delicate beings.After mating, the female mayflies start a compensation flight up the river, to ensure that the eggs laid on the river will sink down to the bottom at the place where their parents emerged. After about 45 days, the eggs hatch into larvae, which remain buried in the mud for three years, until they emerge and molt into adults.When and where we can see Tisa Mayfly?Typically,all Tisa Mayflies mature at once,and for about a week in mid June(from 13 to 15 June),they will be everywhere after 5.00-6.00 PM,dancing over the river in large groups,molting on trees or on the ground, or resting on every available surface,including onlookers.This natural phenomenon with varied intensity is called Tisa blooming.Once they fully mature (after their second molting into a winged state),males have only a few hours to find females and mate before both sexes die. Squadrons of mature males will skim over the river's surface,seeking females.
Why  Tisa Mayfly is threatened?The mayflies are pollution-sensitive animals, thus if they are in or around the water, the water should be of a good quality. Besides being environmental indicators, the mayflies are also a favorite food of many fish, and consequently a favorite bait used by fishermen. The Tisa Mayfly has become extinct in many European countries, and now it can be seen only in Novi Becej,Serbia (Vojvodina province).We need to stop this and save Tisa Mayfly!!! 
What is our goal? Our goal is to research and preserve this amazing insect with funds collected trough this project.We need donations for equipment which would help us do in-depth analysis and research to find out the main problems of Mayfly extinction and how can we stop it.We want to make a documentary about this amazing insects, and to publish it free for all.We want people to preserve this phenomenon with us, for years to come.Also, one of the legends states that in Novi Becej in river Tisa Attila The Hun was buried.He was buried with his triple coffin – which was made of gold, silver and iron and rests at the bottom of the river Tisa.Many people believe and local stories of the elderly states that his burial site is near City Novi Becej on the bottom of the river, but to this day no research have been started in hope to find Attila the Hun’s treasure chest.The stories tell that Attila the Hun was located near the island in the middle of river Tisa, which can be visited.Also it’s a great location to research the Tisa flower insect.Also, each year In that time we have a celebration on river bank called Tisa River of love, where we celebrate this unique phenomenon and Love in general.In the evening you can see thousands of small floating candles all across the river.Also,with us you can visit interesting Island in the middle of Tisa river.On this island we love to enjoy with our family,friends...and that can expect all visitors.The ride to the island is free!!! I hope we get a chance to save this magical flower of Tisa so that they could do their shortest and saddest love story for many years to come.Each donation makes a difference Thank you for your kindness!",8.0,0,"3 Campaigns

How will this vision participate in Sustainable Global Change?The Sustainable Elements:

Aquaponics:
SHE has been partners with the oldest and largest Aquaponics Farm in Austin, Texas for several years.  Austin Aquaponics, created by Rob Nash, is an Austin staple of sustainable farming. Please view the ""Central Texas Gardener"" video link below for more information about Austin Aquaponics and how aquaponics uses far less water to grow produce. The first greenhouse of Sustainable Humane Earth is  being constructed on Austin Aquaponics property - a true community of sustainable organic farmers!



Urban Permaculture Design
By connecting local communities around the globe, through our actions, we can move towards a sustainable and regenerative future. Here's a simple example of what Permaculture Design can do for a 10ft by 20ft space in a backyard in 3 months time. Just imagine if we did this on a global scale!  Let's localize our food source together! 


Below are some great resources for understanding Permaculture Design a little better:
What is Permaculture?
Permaculture is a branch of ecological design, ecological engineering, and environmental design that develops sustainable architecture and self-maintained agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems.[1][2] The term permaculture (as a systematic method) was first coined by Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in 1978. The word permaculture originally referred to ""permanent agriculture""[3] but was expanded to stand also for ""permanent culture,"" as it was seen that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming philosophy.
Permaculture Principles:


Observe and Interact
Catch, Store and Reuse Energy.
Obtain a Yield.
Apply Self Regulation and Feedback.
Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services.
Produce Zero Waste.
Design from Patterns and Details.
Integrate rather than Segregate.
Use Small Slow Solutions.
Use and Value Diversity, Edges and the Marginal. 
Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

<h2><strong><em>Curse on Summit Rock</em></strong></h2>
<p>We are seeking funds to present a new children’s musical that teaches children to become stewards of the environment.  The play will be presented in Central Park and is free.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse on Summit Rock </em></strong>is set on the highest point in Central Park and will be performed <em>in situ</em> and <em>al fresco </em>on the natural stage on Central Park’s Summit Rock<em>.  </em>It’s about a developer who wants to build a candy store in the Park and how his plans to destroy the park are cleverly foiled by Park activists.  The play uses comedy, slap-stick, music, song and audience participation.</p>
<p>The book was written by George Bistransin who learned about playwrighting from translating the classical Latin farces of Plautus and the well-made French plays of Scribe and LaBiche.  His translations were produced through Theater Ludicrum, a non-profit theater company that presented Plautus for high school Latin students in Boston.   He is President of the Village Playwrights, a group that reads scripts to help writers develop their plays.</p>
<p>The music is composed by Lawrence Fancelli. <span>Lawrence is a business graduate of Università degli studi di Firenze and also holds an Audio Engineering diploma from Alchemea in London. He plays clarinet, bass and piano. Among his influences are Debussy and Chaplin, even though the latter had no formal musical training.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>What is the greatest work of art in New York City?   Many people will respond that it’s Central Park.  The Park wasn’t found the way it is.  Nor did come about by accident.  Every inch of it is man-made.  It was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux with great thought and some say genius.   There were, and still are, great pressures to change the original design and use the Park in ways that destroy its greatest value—that of providing urban dwellers with the psychological benefits country environment. </p>
<p>Through comedy and song <em>Curse on Summit Rock</em> teaches the Olmsted’s design principles—the so called seven S’s: <em>sanitation, suitability, scenery, subordination, service, style and separation</em>.   It encourages activism and action—such as picking up litter.  The play also shows that we can succeed in protecting the environment if we put aside our differences and work together.   If you are a parent or educator who wants to impart values that encourage protecting the natural world, you will want to bring your charges to this play.</p>
<p>The play is engaging and entertaining for young children.   There is direct address and audience participation.  Actors go into the audience and it is the audience’s action that drives away the developer and protects the Park.   The play is also entertaining to adults.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are asking for $3000 for five performances.  Money will go for actors’ and accompanist’s stipends and other production expenses such as rehearsal space rental and audition costs. </p>

<h3 class=""p14"" style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you! We hope you will join us today.</h3></div>","""Just because you live away from the oceans, doesn't mean you can't still make a difference to sharks worldwide. Making a difference today in the destructive Shark Fin Trade is easy...""

THE IMPACT
There is a harsh reality occurring in the oceans... Sharks will go extinct if we don't do something now. A recent IUCN report has identified over 1/3 of all shark species (more than 500 in total) are facing extinction – some in our lifetimes. Destroying sharks and the oceans isn't a legacy we want to leave for future generations.Through the power of our TimeShark Wristwatch, we resolved to create a sustainable product that could address these alarming statistics. We’ve committed to ending the plight of sharks worldwide and with your help, stop the destruction of our marine ecosystems. 
 
""100+ Million Sharks Die Each Year. Most are finned alive and dumped back into the ocean to suffer a horrible suffocating death...""

How it works:
The more TIMESHARK wristwatches we sell, the lower our costs go causing more money going towards saving sharks! For every TIMESHARK wristwatch sold, you are able to keep Sharks around the world alive by allowing one of our supporting charities to advance the worldwide conservation of sharks through...
Science - Tagging, tracking, and
Education - Teaching and educating individuals worldwide.
Influence - Spreading the word about the destruction of sharks through social media, media campaigns, documentaries and more.
Action - Building shark and ocean life sanctuaries around the world.
 

Also, because you asked us for it, with every contribution, you get to vote for which charity we will end up supporting. Proudly wear your watch knowing you are making a difference worldwide and remember that by getting friends and family involved, we can raise the percentage sent to the shark charity you want to support.

Starting the movement...
The TIMESHARK wristwatch represents a powerful movement that will continue to grow. By proudly wearing a TIMESHARK wristwatch, you will be making a difference to the future of these sharks. Through every watch sold, you will directly support shark conservation and education projects around the globe.
We designed the TIMESHARK wristwatch to mimic the beauty of Sharks as well as create a design that fits any style, outfit,  or culture. Everything about the watch is beautiful. The battery lasts for about 2 years and of course, just like a shark, this watch is waterproof.

What's needed...


Manufacturing - With your help, we can get this great fashion wristwatch into production if we can cross the $25,000 together. We will invest $3 of every wristwatch (10% of revenue direct) purchased to the voted on charity but if we raise more than our current goal, our costs go down meaning a higher % will be given to the supported charity. We are already working with our manufacturing factory on production because we know you want your TIMESHARK wristwatch as soon as possible. 
Growth - As we grow, we want to increase our support for these causes and get a TIMESHARK wristwatch on people around the world. In order to build upon this momentum, we need you to tell your friends & family... The simplist way to do that is through social media: POST ALL OVER FaceBook, ANNOUNCE ON Twitter, & SHARE YOUR PHOTOS AND STORIES ON INSTAGRAM!
BEFORE...

AFTER...



 


Look Sharp. Make a Difference.
The TIMESHARK wristwatch is an eco-fashion product that allows you to spread the message of the destruction if sharks while looking good & feeling good! Dedicate yourself to saving some sharks today.

<h1>Gegen das Bienensterben</h1>
<p>Mit der Bienen-Sauna retten wir Bienen und erhalten uns eine lebenswerte Umwelt.<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<i>""Wenn die Biene von der Erde verschwindet, hat der Mensch nur noch vier Jahre zu leben."" Albert Einstein</i><br/>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h3>Das Problem</h3>
<p>Die <b>Varroa-Milbe</b> ist gnadenlos: Sie beißt sich an ihrem Bienen-Opfer fest und schwächt deren Brut. Weltweit werden Bienenvölker von dieser Milbe 
 befallen. Neben Pestiziden und Monokulturen ist die Varroa-Milbe das größte Problem für die Honigbiene. Sie gilt als Hauptverursacher des massenhaften 
Bienensterbens. Wehren können sich die Bienen kaum dagegen. Es gibt praktisch kein 
Bienenvolk mehr, das nicht von der Varroa-Milbe geschwächt ist. Bisher wurde vor allem auf Gift und Säure gesetzt – oft mit 
dem Risiko, das ganze Bienenvolk zu verlieren oder sogar schädliche 
Rückstände im Honig in Kauf zu nehmen.</p>
<h3>Die Bedrohung<br/>
</h3>
<p>Äpfel, Birnen, Kirschen, Aprikosen, Pflaumen – sie sind köstlich und bilden die Grundlage für unsere gesunde Ernährung. Für diese gesunde Vielfalt sorgt die Honigbiene. Aber von den ehemals Millionen Bienenvölkern in Deutschland sind lediglich 700.000 Völker übrig. Diese Entwicklung bedroht auch uns Menschen direkt. Denn wir sind extrem 
abhängig von der Bestäubungsleistung der kleinen Flieger. Hierzulande 
sind 75 Prozent der Blütenpflanzen auf Bestäubung angewiesen. Die 
meisten Obst- und Gemüsesorten können wir ohne die fleißigen Helfer 
nicht mehr im Supermarkt kaufen. Jeder
 dritte Bissen unseres Essens ist von Bienen abhängig.</p>
<h3><strong>Die Lösung</strong></h3>
<div><div>
<p>Um das Massensterben von hunderttausenden 
Bienenvölkern zu stoppen, nutzen wir eine uralte Behandlungsmethode - die <strong>Wärme</strong>. Während Menschen die Sauna aufsuchen, um sich zu entspannen oder ihren Stoffwechsel anzuregen, können Bienen 
die Varroamilben durch zwei gepflegte 
Saunagänge im Jahr los werden. Die Biene ""schwitzt"" sich gesund, während die 
wärmeempfindliche Milbe stirbt. Das Ergebnis: gesunde, vitale 
Bienenvölker und gesundes Obst und Gemüse für uns Menschen. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Der Erfolg</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em><i>“Anfang
 des Jahres wurde mein schwächstes Bienenvolk mit der Bienen-Sauna 
behandelt. Jetzt gehört es zu den stärksten Bienenvölkern und trägt mehr
 Honig ein als jedes andere Volk. Ich bin absolut begeistert und habe 
schon ein Gerät vorbestellt.”</i> </em> Karin Backman, Imkerin</p>
<p><em><i>“Ich
 habe die Varroa jahrelang mit Gift bekämpft. Aber damit leider auch die
 nützlichen Mikroorganismen. Bei seiner ersten öffentlichen Vorführung 
der Bienen-Sauna behandelte Richard eines meiner Bienenvölker. Mit 
durchschlagendem Erfolg. Es entwickelte sich unerwartet gut zum 
stärksten Volk am Stand.”</i>  </em>Klas Fürtig, Imker</p>

Mit der Bienen-Sauna retten wir Bienen und erhalten uns eine lebenswerte Umwelt.

""Wenn die Biene von der Erde verschwindet, hat der Mensch nur noch vier Jahre zu leben."" Albert Einstein


Das Problem
Die Varroa-Milbe ist gnadenlos: Sie beißt sich an ihrem Bienen-Opfer fest und schwächt deren Brut. Weltweit werden Bienenvölker von dieser Milbe 
 befallen. Neben Pestiziden und Monokulturen ist die Varroa-Milbe das größte Problem für die Honigbiene. Sie gilt als Hauptverursacher des massenhaften 
Bienensterbens. Wehren können sich die Bienen kaum dagegen. Es gibt praktisch kein 
Bienenvolk mehr, das nicht von der Varroa-Milbe geschwächt ist. Bisher wurde vor allem auf Gift und Säure gesetzt – oft mit 
dem Risiko, das ganze Bienenvolk zu verlieren oder sogar schädliche 
Rückstände im Honig in Kauf zu nehmen.
Die Bedrohung

Äpfel, Birnen, Kirschen, Aprikosen, Pflaumen – sie sind köstlich und bilden die Grundlage für unsere gesunde Ernährung. Für diese gesunde Vielfalt sorgt die Honigbiene. Aber von den ehemals Millionen Bienenvölkern in Deutschland sind lediglich 700.000 Völker übrig. Diese Entwicklung bedroht auch uns Menschen direkt. Denn wir sind extrem 
abhängig von der Bestäubungsleistung der kleinen Flieger. Hierzulande 
sind 75 Prozent der Blütenpflanzen auf Bestäubung angewiesen. Die 
meisten Obst- und Gemüsesorten können wir ohne die fleißigen Helfer 
nicht mehr im Supermarkt kaufen. Jeder
 dritte Bissen unseres Essens ist von Bienen abhängig.
Die Lösung

Um das Massensterben von hunderttausenden 
Bienenvölkern zu stoppen, nutzen wir eine uralte Behandlungsmethode - die Wärme. Während Menschen die Sauna aufsuchen, um sich zu entspannen oder ihren Stoffwechsel anzuregen, können Bienen 
die Varroamilben durch zwei gepflegte 
Saunagänge im Jahr los werden. Die Biene ""schwitzt"" sich gesund, während die 
wärmeempfindliche Milbe stirbt. Das Ergebnis: gesunde, vitale 
Bienenvölker und gesundes Obst und Gemüse für uns Menschen. 







Der Erfolg

“Anfang
 des Jahres wurde mein schwächstes Bienenvolk mit der Bienen-Sauna 
behandelt. Jetzt gehört es zu den stärksten Bienenvölkern und trägt mehr
 Honig ein als jedes andere Volk. Ich bin absolut begeistert und habe 
schon ein Gerät vorbestellt.”  Karin Backman, Imkerin
“Ich
 habe die Varroa jahrelang mit Gift bekämpft. Aber damit leider auch die
 nützlichen Mikroorganismen. Bei seiner ersten öffentlichen Vorführung 
der Bienen-Sauna behandelte Richard eines meiner Bienenvölker. Mit 
durchschlagendem Erfolg. Es entwickelte sich unerwartet gut zum 
stärksten Volk am Stand.”  Klas Fürtig, Imker

While there is a lot of information available on the internet about solar energy, most of it is dry, overly complex and not accessible to the average person.  Through free access to educational videos and one-on-one coaching to answer specific solar questions, homeowners will gain the knowledge and confidence to make smart solar choices with easily understood and independent information provided on the Go Solar Coach website. We have all heard the predictions about climate change and many of us have experienced the impacts, be it record heat or rain fall and the devastation that these events can cause to communities. The decision to install solar represents one of the most powerful actions a homeowner can take to demonstrate their commitment to a safe and sustainable future.With over 20 years of experience as an educator and solar energy researcher, I have the knowledge to provide homeowners with independent information and expert advice to help determine if going solar is right for their families.With favorable federal and state policies and the fact that the price of solar has declined rapidly in recent years, homeowners can both save money and reduce their carbon footprint by going solar. Solar energy is booming in the US and around the world. Today approximately 1 million US households have gone solar. However, this still only represents a small portion of the overall potential. New approaches are needed to reach a broader segment of the population to engage them in the benefits of going solar. The goal of this campaign is to create a valuable resource to encourage homeowners unfamiliar with solar energy to join the solar revolution!About SteveSteve and his wife Kathy and teenage daughter Emery live in central Vermont in a super insulated home that uses natural building materials to create a unique and low energy modern home. His home uses solar in three ways: to provide hot water and supplemental home heating during Vermont’s cold winters and to provide electricity year-round through a grid-tied solar photovoltaic array. With over 20 years of experience teaching energy courses and doing energy consulting, Steve will share his expertise with a broader audience to accelerate the inevitable transition to a clean energy future.Steve likes good, hoppy beer. Luckily Vermont is known for having the most microbreweries per capita of any state!  Steve also likes to laugh, listen to music, snowboard, mountain bike, spend time with family & friends and read widely on economic history and policy.The Boring Stuff
Steve has a PhD in energy economics and policy from the University of Delaware and a MA degree in economics from Binghamton University in western New York State.
Steve is a professor of economics and environmental studies at Green Mountain College and a distance learning instructor for Vermont Law School.
Steve has an energy consulting practice and has conducted research for a variety of organizations including two of the U.S. Department of Energy’s national laboratories, the Solar Electric Power Association, and Vermont’s Green Mountain Power.
Steve is a frequent presenter at professional meetings and conferences and has published dozens of reports and articles in leading journals on a variety of energy topics. For a list and downloadable files of Steve’s research please visit his faculty web site at Green Mountain College.
The Funding RequestThe Go Solar Coach campaign seeks to raise $7,000 to produce eight educational videos on solar energy and to build a fun and whimsical web site that draws people in. I am working with a talented graphic designer Riley Moore located in Manchester Vermont to create the educational videos on solar energy and build a web site to host the video content and to schedule one-on-one consultations to answer homeowners' specific questions if they need additional coaching.The eight educational videos are organized into a Go Solar Starter Video Series and a Go Solar Pro Video Series, each with fun and informative videos based on my decades of experience as an educator and solar energy research scientist. Below is an outline of the Go Solar videos series. Please take a moment to view the outline and the two early-release videos (links below) to get a feel for my fun and whimsical approach to reaching new audiences with information to help homeowners go solar.I'm making these early release videos available to you since you've shown some interest in what I'm about. If you have any feedback, I would welcome it!Here is the working outline of the solar educational videos to be developed:Go Solar Starter Video Series (GSSVS)Educational videos for the very beginner not familiar with solar or home energy use concepts. These videos will help homeowners understand how solar can be used in the home and how to determine if their home or property is suitable for solar.GSSVS #1:  Sunshine Daydream (Click link to see early release video.)This video covers the basics of solar energy and the ways in which we can capture solar energy for use in our homes.GSSVS #2:  Efficiency First!You can perhaps skip this one, but I’ll be pissed ; )This video will cover the basics of how you can strive to use less energy in your home through investments in energy efficient appliances and simple changes in behaviors—yes the C word—Conservation.GSSVS#3:  Is My Home Solar Friendly?Here in the third video of the Go Solar Starter Video Series we cut to the chase and help you become a solar sleuth. Specifically, you will learn how to do a quick assessment of your home and property for good solar access.GSSVS #4:  Box of SunIn the final video in the Go Solar Starter Video Series, you will learn about all of the major components of a home solar energy system that can power your home for decades to come.Go Solar Pro Video Series (GSPVS)Educational videos for those who understand solar energy basics and household energy use concepts but need additional information about the process of going solar. These videos are designed to help homeowners feel confident to engage a local, qualified solar installer.GSPVS #1:  Solar Accounting (Click link to see early release video.)Solar saves you money because you stop paying the utility and produce your own power—what a Deal! In the solar biz they call the process of accounting for the electricity you produce with solar versus what you consume in your home as net metering.GSPVS #2:  Plug Your Home into the SunThis video will cover the process of connecting a home solar energy system to the power grid through your home electric meter. In the solar biz they call this interconnection. GSPVS #3:  How Many Solar Panels Would I Need?In this video, the Go Solar Coach will walk you through the process of determining how many solar panels you will most likely need for your roof or ground mounted home PV system to meet your household electricity needs.GSPVS #4:  Selecting a Qualified Installer & Financing Your Solar SystemSelecting a quality solar installer and finding the best way to finance your new investment are always BIG concerns, again the Go Solar Coach to the rescue! In this video we will cover how to select a qualified installer and all the different ways to pay for solar from crowd source funding, bank financing, to leasing.How You Can HelpFinancial contributions to the campaign will entitle you to free Go Solar Coach branded merchandise and advanced access to the educational videos.Sticker 2.5"" x 4""Drink KoozieTie Dyed T-ShirtOther support is welcome, including marketing advice and support, and promoting the campaign to your networks.

 Exploitation and Air Management
The air is used, not only as mean of obtaining of CO2 for the plant, butas water resource and transportation mechanism of species that enrich thenatural environment.
Continuous Biological Activity
(Process of the living organisms)
So, instead of “Cycles”, a dynamic balance is produced, in other words,everything is developed continually.
A HABITAT is developed.
In the Tropics, the radiation is more intense, which inhibits the growing of the plants, the hothouse doesn’t filter it. The plants are 80% water, 17% carbonic gas and 3% other 14 elements, therefor, plants take CO2 of the air, which has only 0.03%, when limiting its flow in the hothouse, the plant is at risk. They grow very well in the hothouse, but are weak nutritionally.
The plastic color and the changes that present with the usage, affect the plants, directly.



Benefits for the people
By filtering out ultraviolet radiation up to 40%, protects skin cells directlyexposed to the sun, eliminating the effect of ""sunburn""  making it more comfortable and healthy work environment and the summer vacations too.

helped the biggest public relations firms do reputation management and damage
control for oil and chemical companies.<p></p>
<p>But
in 2001 I woke up and began focusing my camera on our modern society and what
drives us to worship everlasting growth, even in the face of overwhelming
evidence we’ve hit the limits to growth. My first documentary on the subject, <i>GrowthBusters: Hooked on Growth</i>,
premiered to a standing-room-only audience in Washington DC in 2011.</p>

Earth:  Real Reality TV for the Conscientious
Audience!


CAN WE MAKE IT TO $25,000????
A very special thanks to the 70+ supporters who helped us reach our basic goal.Two supporters have approached us with a new challenge. They understand the show’s first season budget is much higher than what we’ve raised, so they want us to stretch to $25,000! With two weeks left in the campaign, here is what they are prepared to do. On the day we hit $20,000 supporter #1 will send us a check for another $5,000. If we make it to $25,000 here before midnight on Halloween, supporter #2 will also mail a $5,000 check. That would put us at $35,000 total, covering over half the first season budget.              If you share our vision, please keep the love coming!  Thank you.

Conversation Earth will
be a television series featuring interviews with the world’s most
forward-thinking visionaries about life on Earth. This is a welcome chance to
dig deep and seek understanding of what lies ahead and why we’re headed there.
The discussions will challenge our thinking, and in some cases turn our world
upside down! 


We’re asking your help
to fund editing the first episodes, getting distribution in place, and
publicizing the series.  Donations are tax-deductible in the U.S.

ABOUT THE TV SERIES

Conversation Earth provides surprising,
apolitical perspectives on the most important issues of our time:  



How does humankind relate
to our home planet?

What does our future look
like? 
What are the important
decisions we face? 

How will they impact our
lives and the lives of our children? 

Why do we make the choices
we make? 



This is an interview-based, documentary-style
television series to be aired on networks around the world and the
Internet.  Each episode will examine the
decisions humankind is currently making, how those choices are affecting the
quality of our lives, the livability of our cities, the health of our
environment, and future prospects for our children.  The questions posed address the way society
views progress and success.  
CONVERSATIONS WILL EXPLORE:
·  Living a Satisfying Life                                        ·  Sustainability
·  Cultural Operating Systems                                ·  Defining a Healthy Economy
·  Limits to Growth                                                  ·  Crowd Behavior
·  Population Growth                                              ·  Common Worldviews
·  Cultural Programming                                         ·  Rights of Nature
·  Irrational Behavior                                               ·  How We Became Consumers
Many interviews explore whether or not we are in need
of a paradigm change. Some interviews look at alternative models of success
that don’t rely on perpetual growth in the size of economies or populations.
Topics include community development, conservation, education, happiness,
psychology, human (especially women’s) rights, migration, messaging in the
media, and public policy.  
For our groundbreaking 2011 documentary, GrowthBusters: Hooked on Growth, we interviewed dozens of the brightest scientists, economists, educators, authors, and social critics about various aspects of how we are interacting with the earth.  They offered insightful and unprecedented perspectives on issues that determine why our civilization is unsustainable and how we might get on a better path.

anthology of sustainability related articles and essays from the world’s
leading scholars, economists, environmentalists, and scientists.  This incredible collection of writings will
be available for purchase in 2014 so stay tuned.
GrowthBusters: Hooked on Growth is our 2011 documentary that highlights Dave’s
mission to show and combat our obsession with economic and population
growth.  The film is still being shown in
screenings and festivals.  It is
available for purchase or online rental at www.growthbusters.org.  Once we have
the time/money stay tuned for the sequel!

Who we are, why we do this, and why you’re wonderful
for being a part of it:

DAVE GARDNER

In
my 35-year directing career, I have produced and directed a PBS series and
award-winning films for over a dozen Fortune 500 companies, including several
airlines, Coca-Cola, IBM, and even Enron. I perfected the art of spin as I
helped the biggest public relations firms do reputation management and damage
control for oil and chemical companies.
But
in 2001 I woke up and began focusing my camera on our modern society and what
drives us to worship everlasting growth, even in the face of overwhelming
evidence we’ve hit the limits to growth. My first documentary on the subject, GrowthBusters: Hooked on Growth,
premiered to a standing-room-only audience in Washington DC in 2011.
I
founded the non-profit, Citizen-Powered Media, in 2006 to produce the GrowthBusters documentary, which has now
grown into an ongoing movement to bring attention to our society’s misplaced
notions of progress and success. 
I
live next to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where several
days a week I get to step out the front door and hike to take a break from
saving the planet. I speak regularly about growth addiction to groups and on
television and radio. 
I'm truly blessed to have your help so that I might make a difference in this world, a difference that will give all the children of the world a shot at living a good life!

LYNSEY TAMSEN JONES

I am a California based
filmmaker temporarily lost in Austin, TX. 
I studied Cinema and Documentary Studies under Bill Nichols at San
Francisco State University before working on features, commercials, television,
and documentary films.  I have 8 years experience
in the industry and have worked on projects around the world.  When I’m not working you can find me hiking,
kayaking, practicing yoga, riding my bicycle, and painstakingly attempting to
teach myself how to tend a healthy vegetable garden in the Texas heat.
My niche was found early on when
I discovered that art and environmentalism could have a symbiotic relationship
in nonfiction film.  So I joined the GrowthBusters
team in 2010 to work toward this exact end. 
After working in and seeing the power of television first hand, I am is
thrilled to be working on Conversation
Earth, and I truly believe this is the best way to reach people who want to
do better by themselves and the planet.
I really appreciate your support on this project and truly believe that being a part of this means being a part of an essential social, environmental, and philosophical paradigm change.

Annie Ford, Props Master
 
We need the help of our industry to do what we do.
Over 40% of the props, wardrobe and set dressing we receive goes right out to local charities, arts programs, worthy causes and, now, emergency response. 
75% of our overhead is earned income from the prop shop - an incredibly high percentage for your average non-profit.  However, to get to 100% of operations costs we have to fundraise every year and we appeal to YOU.  
Many employee hours and lots of our rented space is dedicated to serving our neighborhood via processing, preparing and deliveies - all drain out resources, but we would not do it any other way.
 
We do more than give to charity.  In 2012...



Received donations from 642 productions and diverted 123 tons from the waste stream
Hosted eco classes & workshops, Reuse birthday parties, environmental training seminar Green Vendor Expo curated and produced by Film Biz Recycling and many other Gowanus community events.
Hired a full-time upcycler in the Upcycle GALA-RE
Provided space for City Council Member Brad Lander's participatory budget training.
FBR presented ISES NYC Sustainability Summit, Eco-Focus Press Event, ABC/Disney Earth Day Event and Grow NYC

<p>
</p>
<p>Flying-foxes are in trouble. Nature's natural flying gardeners are keystone pollinators and seed dispersers for so many Australian Eucalypt and Rainforest trees, but our large and beautiful bats are dwindling in numbers due to continual habitat loss. We need your help to re-grow rainforest.</p>
<p>NightWings is an ambitious and unique project. A property has been
purchased south of the Daintree River in Far North Queensland, backing onto the
World Heritage listed Daintree National Park: an area recognised as having the
highest biodiversity rate in Australia. The 37 acres (15ha) site will encompass
a small area for low impact, ecologically sustainable Visitor, Education and
Interpretive Centre, and Bat Hospital. We envision to also build a café and
gift shop in the future once the revegetation is established. However, the majority of
the land is being turned over to the exciting task of turning old cane land
into complex lowland rainforest, combined with forest walks for a stunning and
authentic ecotourism experience. The site already contains mature and new
rainforest planting, and transects have revealed a myriad of fauna, including
11 EVNT (Endangered, Vulnerable, &amp; Near Threatened) listed species. These include: the Southern Cassowary, Bennett’s Tree Kangaroo, Grey Goshawk, Grey Falcon, Raja Shelduck, Rufous Owl, Ghost bat, Large-eared Horseshoe bat, the endangered Australian Lace-lid Frog, Spectacled Flying-fox and flora like the vulnerably listed Black Palm.
Government transects have revealed at least 65 additional species of Mammals,
Birds, Reptiles and Amphibians on this property. All (such as these handreared baby Northern Brown Bandicoots) will benefit from increased planting.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1395439/files/20150418192031-bandicootssmall.jpg?1429410031"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Divided into planting stages over 6 years,
the whole project will require over 70,000 trees to be planted. This will provide
a fast-growing framework for animals to bring in secondary seed direct from the
surrounding forest. The first stage of 5.4 acres (2.2ha) (encompassing the
visually-blended centre) will create a significant 60 metre wide corridor
linking mature lowland rainforest to the mangroves at the Daintree River mouth
for the first time in around 100 years.</p>
<p>Working with experts in regeneration like
Rainforest Rescue, Douglas Shire Council and in consultation with the
traditional Kuku Yalanji people, our aim is to create a centre of excellence in
conservation, bat rehabilitation and ecologically diverse land management.</p>
<p>You can help be part of this significant
project by donating a tree (or two or six). Stage 1 will be planted from
December 2015 - March 2016, and will require 10,000 trees. Work has already
begun on seed acquisition, germination and potting seedlings, but we still need
to raise an additional $9,000 for 3,000 of those trees to be grown by Douglas Shire Council Native Nursery.</p>

</h3>
<p>We are Annie, Connie and Dave and together we have over 40 years
experience in Wildlife Care and Rehabilitation, in particular specialising in
Bats and Flying-foxes. We therefore fully understand the importance of
providing suitable habitat for wildlife. Our aim is that by increasing the
habitat of this ecologically diverse and valuable area, we will be able to
provide new homes and feeding areas for much of our local wildlife.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In a previous campaign (thanks to amazing generosity) we raised $10,476. This allowed us to go ahead and pay deposits to Rainforest Rescue to secure the growing of 6000 trees, and to purchase pots and growing medium for the 1000+ trees we are growing ourselves. What we need now in this new campaign is $9000 to secure and fund 3000 mixed rainforest trees from Douglas Shire Native Nursery, to bring the total growing to 10,000 trees. The Council Nursery have been incredibly helpful, are fully supportive of our project, and have given us a good price. Now we need to raise the required funds to make sure that the baby trees are grown and reach the right size for planting out at the right time.</p>
<p>We offer a range of perks ranging from certificates to postcard prints, to large photographic prints, and tote bags and throw pillows. Apart from perks, you will also receive the satisfaction that you have helped create some brand new rainforest in tropical north Queensland; a legacy for the future.</p>

</p>
<p>Every $10.00 you donate will provide funds for the growth, watering, planting, weed
control and maintenance of a tree, and each tree will provide just over one square

<p>As this land is old sugarcane fields it is going to require 3 stages of
land preparation before the trees can be planted and will then require ongoing weed
control for at least 2 years after planting until established. This is where
your contribution will go.</p>

<p>We will continue to liaise and work with organisations such as
Rainforest Rescue and the Douglas Shire Council throughout all stages of this

animals who will then in turn bring in seed from the surrounding forests to
rapidly increase species diversity, with the final aim being rich and complex
mature lowland rainforest.</p>
<p>Flying-foxes plant trees wherever they go, but they also need trees in which to feed and roost. Your donation can help secure more valuable trees for guys like these.

Imagine how much more we could do if we had some funds. Only 1/4 of a mile from the local air port this area has great potential for low impact ecotourism and just a place to enjoy. Thanks for your consideration Mario Torres.

<div>The first, Kiviwama, is where the bulk of the money from this campaign will be going. They are a local organization established in 1999 in response to National Water Week. The focus of this week was to care for and plant indigenous trees, as deforestation around the slopes of Kilimanjaro has drastically reduced the supply of clean drinking water from the glacial springs that supply the villages below. Since their inception, they have grown and planted 300, 000 trees around the Moshi area.  They start the trees in their nursery, which is where I'll be working most of the time. However, they need extra funds as well as physical labour to actually plant the trees in the surrounding villages. That's where your generous donations will help! </div>
<p>The second project, Kili Kids Centre, is an orphanage housing 29 children that also has a permaculture and sustainability project on the farm alongside the orphanage. When I'm not volunteering planting trees with Kiviwama, I'll be working on the farm to provide food to the children living at Kili Kids. </p>
<p>Both these projects mesh right in with my academic interest in sustainable food sourcing and environmental protection, so I'm hoping that in addition to helping out these amazing charities, I'll also gain some valuable experience in my field. </p>
<p>I'm doing all this through a charity called Path to Africa, which is run by a couple of lovely people who also own Hostel Hoff, which is where I'll be staying while there. They are two locals who wanted to offer an opportunity to volunteer with projects in their community where money and time goes directly to those projects. A part of the proceeds from Hostel Hoff go back into local charities through Path to Africa, and all the money raised for Kili Kids Centre and Kiviwama goes directly to those organizations. </p>

The

     robust, easy to install and made of renewable and recycled materials. It
     provides 4000-5000 kWh of green energy per year – day and night, thanks to
     the complementarity of solar panels and a wind turbine. It is built with

<p>The magnitude of this campaign is hard to measure as there are potentially over a million gallons of water contained within the piles of tires on this illegal tire dump.  Texas, especially North Texas, was hit hard last year by the onset of West Nile and with approximately 300,000 tires sitting in a pile and holding up to three gallons of water each it is the ideal breeding ground for millions of mosquito larvae.  These larvae will eventually hatch and be available to carry the virus.  Your funding will illuminate the tires on this property from continuing to be a breeding ground for mosquitoes.  Removing the tires would also eliminate the chance of an environmental catastrophe in the form of an uncontrollable tire fire.  A tire fire of this size could burn for weeks, even months, pumping toxic waste into the air and oily waste water into the soil and ground water.  This property lies 3 miles from the 12th largest lake in the US, Lake Texoma, which is a major water source for much of Grayson, Collin, Dallas and other Counties.  </p>
<p>Your contribution will make a huge difference in preventing potentially billions of dollars in damage to the environment.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for $100,000 to process and remove the remaining approximately 300,000 tires from the site.  It costs us roughly .85 to $1.25 to process and remove each tire to an approved facility.  Our company will make up the difference in cost since we already have all the associated equipment and logistics in place.  As well, we have spent a sizable amount of money on the prevention of further illegal dumping on this property.  100% of the funds will go to pay for the labor to process the tires, the labor and fuel to load the scrap tire material into trucks and most importantly the actual trucking to remove the scrap tire material from the site to an approved facility.  If we don’t reach our goal whatever money has been donated will be used to process and remove as many tires as possible. </p>
<p>Every tire removed reduces the fire and mosquito risk by an enormous amount. </p>
<p><span style="""">What you get besides helping your fellow man and the environment are some pretty exciting perks.  As you notice we are giving away bonsai trees.  As an additional benefit towards this cleanup, but not the main focus, we have partnered with Carbon Tree Farms of Keller and will be turning 17 acres of this property into a tree farm at the conclusion of the cleanup.  What better way to turn a dump into something beautiful and to make up for lost time.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact your donation will make is that you will have a direct immediate effect on the number of tires currently on the site.  You are actively preventing a very real epidemic.  </p>
<p>We feel that the property began with an estimated 350,000 tires and we have removed just over 49,000 which has reduced the spread of West Nile and eliminated some of the risk of an environmental catastrophe.  A direct immediate threat exists to the air, ground and water quality for thousands of residents for Grayson and surrounding counties as well as livestock, crops, and other native plants and animals. Removing this threat as fast as possible is paramount and time is not on our side.  With warmer weather already here in North Texas the Mosquito epidemic is literally coming back to life.  Should this site not be cleaned up it would cost millions to spray and eradicate the mosquitoes in order to prevent West Nile and multi-millions to put out the fire with continuing damage in the millions as well. </p>
<p>Many of you have asked to see pictures of all our different products and their different uses.  See the gallery for pics and descriptions.</p>
<p>TERC is zero landfill company and all scrap tire material removed from the site will be sent to approved state certified end users that will use the material as an alternative fuel source to coal, also known as energy recovery.   </p>
<p>TERC is a Christian and Veteran owned business.   </p>

<p><strong><br/></strong><em>Our campaign goal is set to $2,000</em> <em>USD. This is the minimum GCC needs to return to Burma and give on the ground assistance for one full month. We really need $33,000 for the year. If we can get 2000 people to give around $15USD then we can accomplish our goal. Read on to learn why we need your help!!!!!! </em></p>
<h3><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></h3>
<p>We are Green Communities Consulting (GCC) - a team of dedicated experts and volunteers helping communities in Burma. GCC works closely with communities, organizations and youth practitioners in land use planning, resource management, and sustainable design. Go to <a href=""http://www.greencc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.greencc.org</a> to find out more!</p>
<p><strong>GCC’s mission:</strong> empowerment through integrating environmental practices in community led development.</p>
<p>Three of our six projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cha Nu Nu’s Model Organic Farm and Agro-forestry project (Karen State)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>San Myint &amp; Thuzar Win’s Model Farm and Seed Bank project (Inle Lake)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>San Htay’s Biodiversity, Native Species, and Organic Farming project (Rakhine State)</li>
</ul><p>By contributing to this cause, you will:</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>allow young practitioners to positively change their lives and reach thousands of others along the way,</li>
<li>protect the environment,</li>
<li>contribute towards peace, and</li>
<li>help build a better world.</li>
</ol><p>Together we will touch the lives of thousands.</p>
<h3><strong>THE BREAK DOWN</strong></h3>
<p>In an ideal world we need to raise at least $30,000 to continue the work. That is a lot of money. So, our fundraiser is broken down into three goals:</p>
<p>First                 $16,500 USD (six months of funding)</p>
<p>Each month's costs are $2,750 USD (roughly $16,500 for six months). This will enable GCC to consult on youth projects and conduct community and youth trainings as well as other activities. Each month's operation costs also includes $250 of seed money for youth projects. Once this goal is reached we move to the next goal!</p>
<p>Second           $5,000 USD (registration)</p>
<p>NGO registration and other associated costs are estimated at $5,000 USD to register in the United States. </p>
<p>Third                $16,500 USD (six more months of funding)</p>
<p>This goal marker works the same as goal one. Each month's operation costs also includes $250 of seed money for youth projects.</p>
<p>Any additional funds raised at this point on will be split two ways. Half will go towards student projects this year, and half will go towards setting up a financially sustainable future for GCC projects.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the near future, GCC will work on a model rooftop garden on a small mud brick building. Look to the right to see what you get for $10, $50, $250, and $1,000 donations.</li>
<li>If you contributed, you are eligible to receive special GCC updates, project news, and photos. To be added to this list please send an e-mail to <a href=""mailto:jonathan.rhodes@greencc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jonathan.rhodes@greencc.org</a> and let us know you contributed in the subject line!</li>
</ul><p>So, what happens if we don’t make our goal? It is A-OKEY! At least we tried. The money will still go (in order of priority) to pay for me to assist youth projects, help fund the projects, and register GCC in the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>We are in a unique position to help. My work helps ensure the environment does not get left behind. Even though we are a young organization, we have provided assistance in a number of ways: the construction of the Eco-Village Foundation and successfully provided help with the conceptualization of a number of youth projects.</p>
<h3><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></h3>
<p>Low on cash? That’s fine. We understand not everyone can give money. There are other ways you can help.</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>First go to our website and check out the various project videos. We need your help selecting the last three projects.</li>
<li>You can also spread the word about us. Get our name out there and share Green Communities Consulting with the world. Like us on facebook, follow our twitter, join our blog discussions.</li>

<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>I am the founder of the <a href=""http://theplantsync.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>plant sync</i></a>, an umbrella organization established on Earth Day, 2015. The <a href=""http://theplantsync.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>plant sync</i></a> is committed to bringing climate change action to non-food gardening (see more on <a href=""http://facebook.com/theplantsync"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""http://theplantsync.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">theplantsync.com</a>). <strong>Lighting the Seeds</strong> is one of our programs that will directly reduce the carbon footprint of the <i>plant sync</i>'s operations and inspire other indoor gardeners to do likewise. The founder of the <i>plant sync</i> has a Ph.D. in plant genetics and more than thirty years of experience growing plants in various indoor environments. Our experience and passion to fight climate change motivate us to implement simple, pragmatic, and inexpensive solutions.</p>
<p>The <i>plant sync</i> will reduce the global carbon footprint by using, testing, and promoting the most efficient supplementary lighting solutions for home seed starters. To this day, University publications and other reputable sources continue to recommend fluorescent lamps for hobbyist indoor seed starting. The increasing use of LED lighting for growing plants has resulted in numerous products on the market. But many of these LED lighting solutions are designed for professional horticultural applications. They are often priced out of reach of someone who just wants to get a head start growing tomatoes (e.g.) in their basement. The <i>plant sync</i> has tested LED lighting in typical settings for seed starting for homeowners. Our results show that inexpensive and readily available LED shoplight fixtures work as well or better than fluorescent lamps. Our objectives for this campaign are threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace all our fluorescent lamps in our own operations with more efficient LED fixtures.   This will directly and immediately lower our carbon footprint.</li>
<li>Conduct side-by-side experiments between fluorescent and LED lamps under conditions relevant to hobbyist seed starters and indoor plant growers.</li>
<li>Expand the impact on mitigating climate change by promoting the use of more efficient lighting for home seed starters and indoor plant enthusiasts -- with hard data and professional marketing.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>The Funding</strong></h3>
<p>We need $5000 to purchase lighting materials and seeds. To have the greatest instructional impact we will also pay for professional marketing of our results. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace fluorescent fixtures with LED fixtures: $2000.00</li>
<li>Full spectrum quantum light meter and mounting accessories: $600.00</li>
<li>Experimental LED fixtures for experiments: $1000.00</li>
<li>(3) temperature loggers: $225.00</li>
<li>Seed supplies: $75.00</li>
<li>Miscellaneous supplies: $100.00</li>
<li>Instructional video: $1000</li>
<li>Total: $5000</li>
</ul>
<p>We have chosen flexible funding because we can directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions for each $40.00 received. Each LED fixture costs about $40.00. Every replacement fixture reduces our power draw and the attendant greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Any contribution to our campaign benefits the environment by causing a direct reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. See our Perks for more!</p>

<h3>WCSV needs you to help save local raptors!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WCSV is the only wildlife hospital in Santa Clara County that rehabilitates raptors, which include falcons, hawks, owls, and turkey vultures. This is an expensive process! The cost to rehabilitate the red shouldered hawk featured in this video exceeded $5000 in vet care, surgical supplies, medications and food.</p>
<p>Most injured birds come in after being hit by a car, caught by other animals, or from rodenticide poisoning. Many raptors are orphaned when nests are destroyed by tree trimming or strong winds. The typical length of stay at the center for each raptor is about 60 days, but some are in care for much longer while waiting for a molt before release.</p>
<p>Our raptor aviaries are in almost daily use and most are over 20 years old with necessary repairs and rotting wooden roofs that need to be replaced.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Here's how your donation will return raptors to the wild!</h3>
<p><strong>$25 </strong> replace and upgrade a perch</p>
<p><strong>$50</strong>  repair a hawk-box </p>
<p><strong>$100</strong>  provide 1 week of medication for a single raptor</p>

<p>When you think of the small Central American country El Salvador, what is the first thing that comes to mind? For most people it is images of the massacres, disappearances and violence it suffered during the civil war of 1980s – and most recently gang violence that has made El Salvador one of the most dangerous counties in the world. The Permaculture Institute of El Salvador (IPES) is trying to change that by planting new images – images of hope and the real alternatives we have been building the past 10 years since the Permaculture Institute was founded. </p>
<p>A decade of experimenting, demonstrating and teaching natural ways of living and farming and finally our Government and UN agencies are showing interest.</p>

<h3><strong>A movement of subsistence farmers</strong></h3>
<p>We are a growing movement of subsistence farmers from the northern highlands, the indigenous Kakawira lands, the coastal plains and lakeside villages of El Salvador.

<h3><strong>Spreading the wisdom </strong></h3>
<p>Permaculture reminds us of the simple practical wisdom of our grandparents – of how to make the very best of our small plots of land. We’re improving our soil, diversifying our crops, cleaning our water sources, recycling our waste and planting medicinal gardens. We have demonstration plots in hundreds of communities to show what can be done and our Education Centre in Suchitoto is visited by thousands of people and organisations every year, all looking for solutions to our country’s terrible poverty and environmental vulnerability.</p>

<p> </p></div>","A big hello from Permaculture farmers in El Salvador!
When you think of the small Central American country El Salvador, what is the first thing that comes to mind? For most people it is images of the massacres, disappearances and violence it suffered during the civil war of 1980s – and most recently gang violence that has made El Salvador one of the most dangerous counties in the world. The Permaculture Institute of El Salvador (IPES) is trying to change that by planting new images – images of hope and the real alternatives we have been building the past 10 years since the Permaculture Institute was founded. 
A decade of experimenting, demonstrating and teaching natural ways of living and farming and finally our Government and UN agencies are showing interest.
But right at this crucial moment, we are running out of funds. We are at the “tipping point” and just need one big push from our friends.
Will you help us keep the permaculture movement alive in El Salvador?

<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>How PLAN Started: Trash 2 Treasure at the University of New Hampshire (UNH T2T)</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">In 2010 a group of undergraduates at the University of New Hampshire noticed that students threw away thousands of reusable items when they moved out. They learned that each spring, the amount of waste sent to the local landfill jumped from 25 tons to a staggering 105 tons. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The students fundraised over $9,000 to launch a program that diverted reusable goods away from the local landfill by collecting them in the spring and selling them at a yard sale over move-in weekend. The sale was an enormous success, earning more than enough to cover the program's costs. In its first 3 years, UNH T2T has:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Diverted over 100 tons of waste from UNH's waste stream</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Achieved over $30,000 in sales</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Donated 5 tons of food and clothing to local shelters</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Saved UNH $10,000 in waste disposal costs</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Saved students and families an estimated $125,000 by selling goods at steep discounts compared to local big box stores</span></li>
</ul><p><a name=""anchor3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<h2 class=""p4""><strong>Our Phased Approach</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Following the early success of Trash 2 Treasure at UNH, the students behind the program began working to bring this initiative to other schools. They created PLAN: The Post-Landfill Action Network. PLAN will work with student groups and universities in each of three phases.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p5"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1""><strong>Phase 1: </strong>Accelerated Launch</span></h3>
<p class=""p5"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1"">Paying for year-one expenses like truck and storage rental is the largest barrier to starting a move-out waste reduction program. That’s where our Accelerated Launch program comes in. Through a competitive <span class=""s2"">application</span> process, we will identify student leaders to receive start-up funding to launch a PLAN program on their campus. We’ll work closely with those students and administrators to get the program off the ground so that it is self-sustaining by its second year. The application for Accelerated Launch is available now at <a href=""http://www.postlandfill.org/apply"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PostLandfill.org/Apply</a>!</span></p>
<h3 class=""p5"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1""><strong>Phase 2: </strong>Membership Network</span></h3>
<p class=""p5"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1"">For campuses with existing move-out waste reduction programs, we offer membership services that help students and universities expand and improve their ongoing initiatives. Membership benefits include consulting services, discounts on program costs like truck and storage rental, access to online resources and education, and other customized support.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p5"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1""><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Beyond the Sale</span></h3>
<p class=""p5"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1"">Reducing move-out waste is just the beginning. In Phase 3, we will guide student organizers through a step-by-step campus waste audit. We’ll work with students, administrators, and our network of sustainability partners to design new ways to reduce waste on campus year-round. Additionally, revenue from the yard sale can be used to fund new and innovative sustainability initiatives on campus like organic gardening or renewable energy generation.</span></p>
<p><a name=""anchor4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Why We Need a PLAN<br/></strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><img alt=""Earth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/0i0bUWd.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>The way we use and dispose of Earth’s resources is fundamentally broken. We extract resources to make consumer goods, which soon end up in landfills. But our planet’s resources are not infinite, and our trash is toxic. Eliminating waste helps solve both ends of this problem. In the spirit of “think globally, act locally,” PLAN is beginning by tackling waste on college campuses – where students recognize that we must protect the planet we will inherit. <br/></span></p>
<p><a name=""anchor5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Our Work So Far</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Over a year ago, we began laying the foundation for the expansion of this program to the national scale. Today we have huge momentum, a dedicated team of organizers and advisors, and a wide network of supporters in the sustainability arena. Here are some of our recent successes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Secured a 6-month residency at the New Hampshire Innovation and Commercialization Center, a shared working space in downtown Durham. </span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Established a partnership agreement with the University of New Hampshire to pilot Phase 3 waste reduction initiatives and conduct a full waste audit. </span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Received the $10,000 Samuel Huntington Public Service Award.</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Established two paid PLAN internships supported by UNH’s Center on Social Innovation and Finance and the Steelman Fellowship through UNH’s College of Health and Human Services.</span></li>
</ul><p><a name=""anchor6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<h2 class=""p4""><strong>What Your Donation Supports</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">We’re passionate about helping other students bring this program to their campus – but to build out PLAN on a national scale, we need your support. Your donation will help kickstart our work as a national nonprofit. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Together with a team of advisors in nonprofit management, business development and social entrepreneurship, we’ve put together a three year roadmap for PLAN, after which point we will be independently sustained by membership fees from the schools we work with. That roadmap has us on track to meet the following goals:</span></p>
<p class=""p2"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1""><strong>Year One:</strong> 3 new Accelerated Launch programs, 12 member schools<br/><strong>Year Two:</strong> 6 new Accelerated Launch programs, 24 member schools<br/><strong>Year Three:</strong> 8 new Accelerated Launch programs, 60 member schools</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">We can reduce thousands of tons of waste by reaching these schools – but first, we have to meet our fundraising goals. Your donation will support our ongoing development work including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Creation</strong> of resources for students like best-practice guides and waste and sustainability fact sheets.</span></li>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Outreach</strong> to university sustainability offices and direct engagement with student groups to identify common challenges and opportunities to launch new programs and improve and expand existing initiatives.</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1""><strong>Development</strong> of our nonprofit business infrastructure including strategic and financial planning, incorporation and 501(c)(3) certification, web development, and more.</span></li>
<li class=""li3"">
<strong>Expansion</strong> of our network of sustainable business partners including trucking, storage, waste-hauling, composting and recycling companies.</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, IndieGoGo recieves a small percentage of funds raised as a platform fee. <strong>Reaching or exceeding our goal of $50,000 signficantly reduces this fee. </strong>Our goal reflects a very conservative projection for PLAN's growth – but there are dozens of schools who are eager to work with us. <strong>Exceeding our goal of $50,000 will allow us to reach more campuses more quickly and reduce far more waste on each campus.</strong> The more we raise, the more we can do!<br/><br/></p>
<p>Update [7/12/13]: Donations will pass through our nonprofit fiscal sponsor, <a href=""http://www.climatecounts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Climate Counts</a>. This allows your contribution to be tax deductible via Climate Counts' 501(c)(3) designation, while PLAN's own 501(c)(3) application is under review. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Dear _______,</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I am writing to share with you a project that I feel is very imporant. PLAN: The Post-Landfill Action Network is a nonprofit being launched by a group of recent graduates from the University of New Hampshire. As students, they started a program to reduce waste by collecting items students would have otherwise thrown out at the end of the school year then selling it all at a yard sale over move-in weekend. Their initiative at UNH was so successful that they've created PLAN, which will provide start-up funding and support to students at other schools who want to create waste reduction initiatives on their own campuses. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">To cover start-up expenses and the first round of funding for schools, PLAN launched an online fundraiser to raise $50,000 by September 5. They're off to a good start but still need more support – so I'm writing to ask your help. Visit <a href=""http://igg.me/at/PLAN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/PLAN</a> to see a video from their team and read more about the project.

Through a competitive application process, we will identify student leaders to receive start-up funding to launch a PLAN program on their campus. We’ll work closely with those students and administrators to get the program off the ground so that it is self-sustaining by its second year. The application for Accelerated Launch is available now at PostLandfill.org/Apply!
Phase 2: Membership Network
For campuses with existing move-out waste reduction programs, we offer membership services that help students and universities expand and improve their ongoing initiatives. Membership benefits include consulting services, discounts on program costs like truck and storage rental, access to online resources and education, and other customized support.
Phase 3: Beyond the Sale
Reducing move-out waste is just the beginning. In Phase 3, we will guide student organizers through a step-by-step campus waste audit. We’ll work with students, administrators, and our network of sustainability partners to design new ways to reduce waste on campus year-round. Additionally, revenue from the yard sale can be used to fund new and innovative sustainability initiatives on campus like organic gardening or renewable energy generation.

Why We Need a PLAN
The way we use and dispose of Earth’s resources is fundamentally broken. We extract resources to make consumer goods, which soon end up in landfills. But our planet’s resources are not infinite, and our trash is toxic. Eliminating waste helps solve both ends of this problem. In the spirit of “think globally, act locally,” PLAN is beginning by tackling waste on college campuses – where students recognize that we must protect the planet we will inherit. 

Our Work So Far
Over a year ago, we began laying the foundation for the expansion of this program to the national scale. Today we have huge momentum, a dedicated team of organizers and advisors, and a wide network of supporters in the sustainability arena. Here are some of our recent successes:

Secured a 6-month residency at the New Hampshire Innovation and Commercialization Center, a shared working space in downtown Durham. 
Established a partnership agreement with the University of New Hampshire to pilot Phase 3 waste reduction initiatives and conduct a full waste audit. 
Received the $10,000 Samuel Huntington Public Service Award.
Established two paid PLAN internships supported by UNH’s Center on Social Innovation and Finance and the Steelman Fellowship through UNH’s College of Health and Human Services.

What Your Donation Supports
We’re passionate about helping other students bring this program to their campus – but to build out PLAN on a national scale, we need your support. Your donation will help kickstart our work as a national nonprofit. 
Together with a team of advisors in nonprofit management, business development and social entrepreneurship, we’ve put together a three year roadmap for PLAN, after which point we will be independently sustained by membership fees from the schools we work with. That roadmap has us on track to meet the following goals:
Year One: 3 new Accelerated Launch programs, 12 member schoolsYear Two: 6 new Accelerated Launch programs, 24 member schoolsYear Three: 8 new Accelerated Launch programs, 60 member schools
We can reduce thousands of tons of waste by reaching these schools – but first, we have to meet our fundraising goals. Your donation will support our ongoing development work including:

Creation of resources for students like best-practice guides and waste and sustainability fact sheets.
Outreach to university sustainability offices and direct engagement with student groups to identify common challenges and opportunities to launch new programs and improve and expand existing initiatives.
Development of our nonprofit business infrastructure including strategic and financial planning, incorporation and 501(c)(3) certification, web development, and more.

Expansion of our network of sustainable business partners including trucking, storage, waste-hauling, composting and recycling companies.
Additionally, IndieGoGo recieves a small percentage of funds raised as a platform fee. Reaching or exceeding our goal of $50,000 signficantly reduces this fee. Our goal reflects a very conservative projection for PLAN's growth – but there are dozens of schools who are eager to work with us. Exceeding our goal of $50,000 will allow us to reach more campuses more quickly and reduce far more waste on each campus. The more we raise, the more we can do!
Update [7/12/13]: Donations will pass through our nonprofit fiscal sponsor, Climate Counts. This allows your contribution to be tax deductible via Climate Counts' 501(c)(3) designation, while PLAN's own 501(c)(3) application is under review.

Dear _______,
I am writing to share with you a project that I feel is very imporant. PLAN: The Post-Landfill Action Network is a nonprofit being launched by a group of recent graduates from the University of New Hampshire. As students, they started a program to reduce waste by collecting items students would have otherwise thrown out at the end of the school year then selling it all at a yard sale over move-in weekend. Their initiative at UNH was so successful that they've created PLAN, which will provide start-up funding and support to students at other schools who want to create waste reduction initiatives on their own campuses. 
To cover start-up expenses and the first round of funding for schools, PLAN launched an online fundraiser to raise $50,000 by September 5. They're off to a good start but still need more support – so I'm writing to ask your help. Visit http://igg.me/at/PLAN to see a video from their team and read more about the project. They're also offering handmade upcycled items as perks for donors. If you're not able to make a donation, you can also support PLAN by passing this along to 5 people who you know particularly care about the planet. You can also like and follow them on Facebook and Twitter! Thank you!

<p>The project aims to provide farmers with a profitable source of income ( super hybrid rice) to replace their bare subsistence on normal rice farming then manage the profits to repair their ""slash and burn"" hill plots and turn them into more productive, permaculture farms. Rice is their traditional mainstay and cash crop so we reasoned that trebling rice yield would provide the necessary foundation for all else to follow.</p>
<p>By enlisting the cooperation of key government stakeholders we now have a formidable team to make it happen.</p>

<p>Contact Person: Manfred Kemter: email: mkemter@ozemail.com.au</p>
<p>Funding: One Good Idea: George Parry: georgeparry@iprimus.com.au</p>
<h4 style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Project description</h4>
<p>The ultimate goal of the One Good Idea group is to help reduce poverty and unemployment by developing agri – enterprises, making food plentiful and enhancing the enabling mechanisms for economic activities.</p>
<h4 style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Rationale for proceeding</h4>
<p>The cultivation of hybrid rice varieties can result in significantly increased yield, and income, for the same area of land under production. This hybrid rice project aims to help increase the average household income of farmer beneficiaries by approximately 30% and generate employment during project construction, farm production and off – farm activities.</p>
<p>This proposed project on hybrid rice production aims to maximize the potential of agricultural land in Aklan and Antique. The project intends to provide demonstration farms to Agricultural Reform Beneficiaries  (ARBs) and assist them with appropriate technology and extend financial assistance by providing inputs through a soft loan scheme.</p>

<p>Technical aspects</p>
<p>Hybrid rice production</p>
<p>Aklan State University and DAR</p>
<p>Roll-Over Scheme</p>
<p>Aside from the training and techno-transfer, each of the cooperators will be provided with inputs based on the computed requirements of their respective demo farm. These inputs will be given as a soft loan granted to the cooperators through the proponent organization with no interest payable after 1 cropping cycle. These schemes are included in the PSP approved by the BOD and presented to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Proceeds generated from the Rice Production Project will be used by the proponent organization as a capital to other target project beneficiaries. After one (1) cropping cycle, new set of cooperators is expected to implement and replicate the project. Five new cooperators are expected to replicate the project on its second year and another 5 for the cropping third year.</p>
<h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>Employment Generation</b></h3>
<p>This project will generate at least 50 full-time-equivalent jobs from the 5 identified cooperators. Each cooperator would at least need a hand / or an assistant especially in the land preparation. The technology to be adopted from this project entails intensive but efficient labor system. Land Preparation, Tilling, Basal fertilizer application, seed soaking, sowing, transplanting, fertilizing, pesticide application, harvesting, etc. would at least require 10 employees per hectare of demo farms totaling to 50 jobs for the entire one (1) project cycle. For the 2nd project cycle, a new set of cooperators or replicators will be identified employing a possible additional job generation of at least 50 more.</p>
<h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>Environmental sustainability</b></h3>
<p>This project will encourage adoption of environment-friendly activities. Use of organic fertilizers and organic based insecticides and pesticides will be promoted. Part of the training module would include a discussion on the practice of natural farming methods and application of organic methods using protocols established under the SALT (Sloping Agricultural Land technique) strategy. </p>
<p><b>Initial costs estimates</b></p>
<p>Project costs</p>
<p>·Includes all costs incurred during the first cycle of rice cropping to be funded by One Good idea with support from Ph Government and UN. Prices are in Philippine Peso convertible at 40 to the AUD. i.e. divide by 40 to get Aussie dollars.</p>

<p>As can be seen, the use of new Chinese Super Hybrid rice with a permaculture polyculture, incorporating piggeries, chickens and nitrogen fixing food crops will eventually eliminate costly and destructive chemical fertilisers. With input from the DAR and the agriculture Dept of Aklan U we plan to turn around the destructive farming practices used by hill farmers and help them to a prosperous and ecologically sound farming life.</p>

<div>The driving force behind this project is Manfred Kemter. Manfred has spent his life developing permaculture principles to build resilience and self-sufficiency. Here's his story:</div>
<p></p>
<p>I was born at the outbreak of WWII in Biburg, Bavaria and spent my first 13 years on my grandmother's 35 Ha farm which had provided total self-sufficiency for my extended family for over 1000 years. Ours was a rural community based on total self-sufficiency. Our extended family lived on the family farm and gained all of our sustenance from 35Ha of agricultural land which had been farmed for 1000 years using permaculture principles, surviving the 100 years war, the 30 years war, Depression, hyperinflation, famine, WWI and WWII and feeding a large community of starving people after the destruction of Augsburg in WWII. Aside from rain and sunshine, there was no off-farm input. And nothing was wasted. </p>

<blockquote>     Our 35Ha smallholding was completely self-sufficient</blockquote>
<p>In our community we all worked cooperatively to ensure community survival. There were no men because of the war so I went out, from early childhood with a cart and we harvested hay or potatoes, wheat or rye. Because of the weather the animals were always stabled so we took the feed to the animals rather than letting them wander the fields. This meant we maximised crop production as the animals did not trample any crops. This had the added benefit that all the biomass from the fields was now concentrated in the stables. Manure and deep litter  were a wonderful resource that we applied directly to our crops. The effluent from the stables and from our toilet went directly to a holding tank and was applied to the fields. Stable straw was changed daily and used as mulch. Every waste product was recycled. We had no artificial fertiliser. It was all organic and balanced. As a child it was my job to go out with buckets and barrows and spread this compost. The fields grew lush and green and the soil was dark and rich, full of humus and worms. The fields were ploughed in the Autumn and the compost was spread in the furrows. The snow would then cover the fields and in the Spring the fields were harrowed again and planted. </p>

The family's meat needs were met by our livestock. We had an oversupply of everything -fruit, berries, grains, vegetables, meat, eggs etc, and whatever was harvested in abundance was preserved. Apples were crushed into cider, fruit was dried or stored in barrels in the cellar along with the potatoes. Vegetables were pickled. We cut ice from a pool of water that the community used that was kept over winter in an underground cavern to keep the cellar cool. A team of people would go down into the cave and cut blocks of ice with saws and carry them up to the cart, distributing them to all the farmers. </div><div>

<blockquote>                                 Food stored in root cellar<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>We stored grain and fruit, meat and vegetables in the cellar. We made and stored sausages and smoked ham, bacon, dried meat, poultry etc which we hung in the cellar. We pickled, dried, stored everything - to get the last ounce of productivity from our farm. We had no electricity and no refrigeration so we stored everything in this way. We baked our own bread from our own grain once a week - 2kg loaves of black rye bread - you can still buy these in specialist bakers in Sydney if you know where to look. Any crops not eaten by people such as what we called 'pig potatoes' were boiled in a vat and compressed into a cake then used as high-energy stock feed. </p>

<p>I attended the St Georg school in Augsburg until I came to Australia at age 13. The history of the city and it's numerous great citizens (Luther, Diesel etc) had a lasting impact on my life and the philosophy I developed. The industry and the charity of a wealthy 17th century philanthropic Augsburg family, the Fuggers were upheld as ideals in my schooling.</p>

<blockquote>                                     Augsburg today</blockquote>
<p>The Fuggerei is the worlds first community housing project founded 500 years ago. It is still functioning today. The annual rent was and remains a Rheinish florin, which was then approximately a week's wages for a craftsman. It was left this way over the centuries implementing the core philosophy of ""assistance so others can help themselves"". The modern Fuggerei thus helps to relieve the city of its welfare obligations. My experience of this influenced my personal philosophy. I went on in Australia to develop disabled group housing which relieved the state of much of its financial burden by introducing Bill Glaser's Choice Theory approach to personal responsibility and self reliance, enabling previously highly dependent people to achieve personal independence and pride.</p>

<blockquote>                  Fuggerei community housing - Augsburg</blockquote>
<p>On the farm there was not much time for play, there was something for me to do wherever I went. What I liked most and what I remember from my earliest time was doing the chores in the farmhouse. Feeding the chickens, collecting eggs, feeding the pigs, cows and oxen. I loved keeping up the firewood to the kitchen and the huge oven in the living room. There was an abundance of berries to pick and fallen fruit to gather in the orchard; some for jam others for cider and my favourite, green-apple jelly.</p>
<p>As I got older, I was involved in all facets of the mixed farm operation. Harvest and planting were the busiest times, however preparing the soil in autumn and spring involved the spreading of stable manure to compost into the ploughed soil under the snow and then boost the new crop and pastures with liquid stable waste into the summer. Timing was the key at all stages to ensure a maximum quality harvest. <br/></p>
<p>The days were long and only Sundays and festival days were times of respite and fun. The morning would start at 4.30am with prayer, breakfast and then the trip to the fields for a sunrise start. Morning tea then a two hour lunch break at home to avoid the beat of the day. Usually the day would end at 6.30 to 7pm. Schooldays were a break in the routine once the wartime evacuations were over but holidays were long and hot on in the summer. </p>
<p>It was towards the end of the evacuation period that I witnessed the bombing of Augsburg which annihilated half the city and most of its industry. 16 Jul 1944 A total of 1,087 B-17 Flying Fortress bombers USAAF Eighth Air Force attacked Germany in three waves (407, 238, and 407 bombers, respectively), escorted by 240, 214, and 169 fighters, respectively, with most of the bombers targeting Munich, Stuggart, Augsburg, and Saarbrucken; a total of 11 bombers and 3 fighters were lost. For 3 days after the bombing of Augsburg I witnessed a constant steam of people passing and visiting our farm in search of food.</p>

<blockquote>                                   Destruction of Augsburg</blockquote>
<p>Whatever else the defeat may have meant to the Germans, it meant that they were going to go hungry, probably for a long time; and they were hungry already. The SHAEF maximum daily ration for normal consumers was 1,550 calories, but the amounts actually being issued ranged from 804 calories in Hesse and Hesse-Nassau to 1,150 calories in parts of the Rhineland. The normal consumers were the new proletariat of the occupation. The gentry were the ""heavy"" and ""very heavy"" workers, railroad workers and miners for instance, who could get up to 2,800 calories. The out-and-out aristocrats were the self-suppliers, that is, the farmers, who did not have to trouble themselves with ration cards. The normal consumer was not starving, but if he subsisted entirely on his ration, which no one really expected him to do, he was very close to it. A typical week's ration issued during May of 1945 consisted of the following: bread, 3 pounds; meat, 4 ounces; butter and fat, 2 ounces; sugar, 7 ounces; macaroni and spaghetti, 5 ounces; potatoes, 6 pounds; some cereal (added to the children's ration), 6 ounces; milk (only for children up to six), 1 quart. The total was less than 1,000 calories per day, and the difference was made up by adding a few ounces of green vegetables ""provided trucks can be found to haul them and provided the people can eat rhubarb without sugar."" </p>

<blockquote>Permaculture using Keyline and Sloping Agricultural Land Technology</blockquote>
<p>In Germany by the end of the war there were no men left! Then Polish and Russian prisoners who helped out during the war had returned home and my uncle, my father's brother, came back from Siberia in 1951. He was part of a three hundred thousand (300,000) man army captured by the Russians of which only 7,000 returned. He lived to age 86. When my cousin married, the agricultural land was added to her husband's estate as was the custom in rural inheritance practice.<br/></p>
<p>When we arrived in Sydney Dec 25, 1952, it was a shock to observe the monotony of the country on the train journey from Sydney to Geelong in Victoria; a journey lasting beyond 24 hours. The countryside was either bush or brown gravel; the land had been overstocked and eaten down to the roots. The few remaining sheep mere skeletons; either living or dead. A scene I was never to forget. </p>
<p>Ten years later, when I had my own farm, I rotated the cattle when they had eaten down to four or five centimetres with a layer of organic matter underneath that of at least 2cm to reduce evaporation and encourage the development of natural nutrients. The other thing that left me with a lasting impression was that every arable piece of ground and most of the slopes had been cleared of trees or ringbarked; the whole trip was dotted with thousands of bleached, decaying trunks that had been killed a hundred years before to promote growth of grass or wheat. Later, on our own property I promoted the growth of the most valuable trees and paid for the full purchase price with the trees I culled. Coincidentally, all old gnarled and twisted trees were left for homes and shelter for a diverse assortment of wildlife. I later had the property declared as a sanctuary. The trees have added 50 years of growth and remain there to this day. There were two major commercial benefits from this approach; The growth in timber added more value than the land was worth and later when I subdivided the property the blocks sold quicker and brought a better price than any surrounding, cleared subdivision.</p>

<br/><p>I went to school in Australia for four years, worked on a farm after school every day and then for four years after I left school. After eight years I managed that farm and as my parting act-exported bulbs to Holland. We became so competitive that we bought out the other bulb growers in Geelong and supplied flower bulbs Australia wide. This was done by mechanising, improvising and economising. We saved labour costs by mechanising the sowing, weeding and harvesting process; then added value by refocusing the workers into adding value by grading and packaging for our customers. We conceived and manufactured specialised machines from old car and machinery parts and streamlined the packaging process. The greatest return came from developing the acquired land into smaller holdings or rural subdivisions as well as stocking the more viable 1,000 to 10,000 acre with mainly sheep from drought affected NSW.</p>
<p>In 1959 I left to complete my schooling and learn English by focusing on language and science in a four year BA Ed course. During this period I studied Australian farming methods and practices and concluded that most farmers in Australia don't enjoy the the lifestyle and quality of life of the average German farmer. The most successful operators  here are either large, mechanised and well schooled family organisations or companies employing agriculture and business graduates. After that are the traders who buy run down, debt or drought affected farms; engage in minimal farming, window dress and wait for a good season to sell.  In Germany, farms are long term enterprises.</p>

<blockquote>                                      Rice planting - Philippines</blockquote>
<p>Farming formed a large part of my life in Australia. All my experience, my study and my work centred around primary production, I exported meat and live sheep, studied tropical pasture development and the various uses of nitrogen fixing, leguminous shrubs and trees. I attended field days in Northern Queensland and the Northern Territory and the highlight in my memory was planning and conducting a 10 day tour of tropical farming enterprises. This involved Kings Ranch Fullers seeds and a day in Humpty Doo with James Gayoso catching wild buffalo for export. The tour was arranged for Seichi Kawai, the world's biggest emerald dealer at the time. His farm near Bogota spanned the size of a small country and he planned to develop this into a modern, productive agricultural enterprise. He imported farm machinery and seeds as well as cattle, suitable for tropical primary production.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years here in The Philippines due to rapid population growth and the desperate need to feed this population, the forests have been degraded through the practice of slash and burn. The topsoil has been progressively lost and less than 20% of natural forest remains.  Rice is the mainstay and if the season is good the farmers eat until the next harvest. Competition from cheap imports of rice, the cost of production, especially the cost of fertiliser, has pushed them further into poverty. The typhoon wiped out more than 60% of the country's crop. With the help of a group of philanthropists, loosely formed into ""the One Good Idea Group"" I have moved to the Aklan  Region in the Philippines to introduce a comprehensive program designed to bring prosperity to these victims of centuries of archaic practices and finally a devastating storm. The key to this program is the introduction of high yielding Super Hybrid rice and from there the introduction of proven methods of Key-line farming, focusing on the use of organic fertiliser production and crop diversification.<br/></p>

A third of the people on the planet are in hand-to-mouth poverty. Hopeless, isn't it? But what if you could change that - How would you do it?In the 70's we had the Green Revolution. Today we have Super Hybrid rice. Introduce ultra-high-yield rice together with Permaculture principles to the poorest subsistence farmers in the Philippines and turn around millions of lives.Here is what we're doing:We are introducing a permaculture system using nitrogen fixing shrubs to create highly fertile terraced land on which to grow Super Hybrid rice as a cash crop. 

               
              Lucaena trees fix nitrogen for crops in terraces
The project aims to provide farmers with a profitable source of income ( super hybrid rice) to replace their bare subsistence on normal rice farming then manage the profits to repair their ""slash and burn"" hill plots and turn them into more productive, permaculture farms. Rice is their traditional mainstay and cash crop so we reasoned that trebling rice yield would provide the necessary foundation for all else to follow.
By enlisting the cooperation of key government stakeholders we now have a formidable team to make it happen.

Hybrid Rice Production, Aklan/Antique Provinces Business Proposal
Title of the Project: Hybrid Rice Production Project
Proponent: One Good Idea, Australia, a philanthropic group directed by Manfred Kemter & George Parry
Beneficiaries Barangay, Municipality Province: Aklan, Region VI Antique,
Contact Person: Manfred Kemter: email: mkemter@ozemail.com.au
Funding: One Good Idea: George Parry: georgeparry@iprimus.com.au
Project description
The ultimate goal of the One Good Idea group is to help reduce poverty and unemployment by developing agri – enterprises, making food plentiful and enhancing the enabling mechanisms for economic activities.
Rationale for proceeding
The cultivation of hybrid rice varieties can result in significantly increased yield, and income, for the same area of land under production. This hybrid rice project aims to help increase the average household income of farmer beneficiaries by approximately 30% and generate employment during project construction, farm production and off – farm activities.
This proposed project on hybrid rice production aims to maximize the potential of agricultural land in Aklan and Antique. The project intends to provide demonstration farms to Agricultural Reform Beneficiaries  (ARBs) and assist them with appropriate technology and extend financial assistance by providing inputs through a soft loan scheme.

Stakeholders

·Farmers and Cooperatives in Aklan and Pandan Antique
·The participants were selected by officers of DAR Aklan and Antique, Aklan State University and Abante - a NGO with 4,000 members.

·The participants from DAR and Abante training engaged in consultation activities with the community to demonstrate their engagement with the project. They were assessed in particular for their preparedness to change practices.
·Hybrid rice production will assist the community Initially by more than doubling the normal yield.
The project will initially involve five (5) (Agricultural Reform Beneficiaries) ARB farmer-cooperators from the (Agricultural Reform Cooperative) ARC. Each of the hybrid rice farmer cooperators will utilize at least a hectare of irrigated rice land.
Cooperators for the Organic Fertilizer Production will be identified by the subject organization (Abante) as this will be co-managed by the cooperative.
The initial cooperators will be selected by DAR and Abante representatives based on heir preparedness to adopt new farming techniques.

Aklan State University and DAR
Roll-Over Scheme
Aside from the training and techno-transfer, each of the cooperators will be provided with inputs based on the computed requirements of their respective demo farm. These inputs will be given as a soft loan granted to the cooperators through the proponent organization with no interest payable after 1 cropping cycle. These schemes are included in the PSP approved by the BOD and presented to the General Assembly.
Proceeds generated from the Rice Production Project will be used by the proponent organization as a capital to other target project beneficiaries. After one (1) cropping cycle, new set of cooperators is expected to implement and replicate the project. Five new cooperators are expected to replicate the project on its second year and another 5 for the cropping third year.
Employment Generation
This project will generate at least 50 full-time-equivalent jobs from the 5 identified cooperators. Each cooperator would at least need a hand / or an assistant especially in the land preparation. The technology to be adopted from this project entails intensive but efficient labor system. Land Preparation, Tilling, Basal fertilizer application, seed soaking, sowing, transplanting, fertilizing, pesticide application, harvesting, etc. would at least require 10 employees per hectare of demo farms totaling to 50 jobs for the entire one (1) project cycle. For the 2nd project cycle, a new set of cooperators or replicators will be identified employing a possible additional job generation of at least 50 more.
Environmental sustainability
This project will encourage adoption of environment-friendly activities. Use of organic fertilizers and organic based insecticides and pesticides will be promoted. Part of the training module would include a discussion on the practice of natural farming methods and application of organic methods using protocols established under the SALT (Sloping Agricultural Land technique) strategy.

As can be seen, the use of new Chinese Super Hybrid rice with a permaculture polyculture, incorporating piggeries, chickens and nitrogen fixing food crops will eventually eliminate costly and destructive chemical fertilisers. With input from the DAR and the agriculture Dept of Aklan U we plan to turn around the destructive farming practices used by hill farmers and help them to a prosperous and ecologically sound farming life.

Manfred's Story


                                              Manfred Kemter

The driving force behind this project is Manfred Kemter. Manfred has spent his life developing permaculture principles to build resilience and self-sufficiency. Here's his story:

I was born at the outbreak of WWII in Biburg, Bavaria and spent my first 13 years on my grandmother's 35 Ha farm which had provided total self-sufficiency for my extended family for over 1000 years. Ours was a rural community based on total self-sufficiency. Our extended family lived on the family farm and gained all of our sustenance from 35Ha of agricultural land which had been farmed for 1000 years using permaculture principles, surviving the 100 years war, the 30 years war, Depression, hyperinflation, famine, WWI and WWII and feeding a large community of starving people after the destruction of Augsburg in WWII. Aside from rain and sunshine, there was no off-farm input. And nothing was wasted. 


     Our 35Ha smallholding was completely self-sufficient
In our community we all worked cooperatively to ensure community survival. There were no men because of the war so I went out, from early childhood with a cart and we harvested hay or potatoes, wheat or rye. Because of the weather the animals were always stabled so we took the feed to the animals rather than letting them wander the fields. This meant we maximised crop production as the animals did not trample any crops. This had the added benefit that all the biomass from the fields was now concentrated in the stables. Manure and deep litter  were a wonderful resource that we applied directly to our crops. The effluent from the stables and from our toilet went directly to a holding tank and was applied to the fields. Stable straw was changed daily and used as mulch. Every waste product was recycled. We had no artificial fertiliser. It was all organic and balanced. As a child it was my job to go out with buckets and barrows and spread this compost. The fields grew lush and green and the soil was dark and rich, full of humus and worms. The fields were ploughed in the Autumn and the compost was spread in the furrows. The snow would then cover the fields and in the Spring the fields were harrowed again and planted. 

        The farm had an annual cycle and it involved everything, pigs, chickens, eggs, ducks, cows, crops, fruit, pasture. The family's meat needs were met by our livestock. We had an oversupply of everything -fruit, berries, grains, vegetables, meat, eggs etc, and whatever was harvested in abundance was preserved. Apples were crushed into cider, fruit was dried or stored in barrels in the cellar along with the potatoes. Vegetables were pickled. We cut ice from a pool of water that the community used that was kept over winter in an underground cavern to keep the cellar cool. A team of people would go down into the cave and cut blocks of ice with saws and carry them up to the cart, distributing them to all the farmers. 

                                 Food stored in root cellar

We stored grain and fruit, meat and vegetables in the cellar. We made and stored sausages and smoked ham, bacon, dried meat, poultry etc which we hung in the cellar. We pickled, dried, stored everything - to get the last ounce of productivity from our farm. We had no electricity and no refrigeration so we stored everything in this way. We baked our own bread from our own grain once a week - 2kg loaves of black rye bread - you can still buy these in specialist bakers in Sydney if you know where to look. Any crops not eaten by people such as what we called 'pig potatoes' were boiled in a vat and compressed into a cake then used as high-energy stock feed. 

I attended the St Georg school in Augsburg until I came to Australia at age 13. The history of the city and it's numerous great citizens (Luther, Diesel etc) had a lasting impact on my life and the philosophy I developed. The industry and the charity of a wealthy 17th century philanthropic Augsburg family, the Fuggers were upheld as ideals in my schooling.


                                     Augsburg today
The Fuggerei is the worlds first community housing project founded 500 years ago. It is still functioning today. The annual rent was and remains a Rheinish florin, which was then approximately a week's wages for a craftsman. It was left this way over the centuries implementing the core philosophy of ""assistance so others can help themselves"". The modern Fuggerei thus helps to relieve the city of its welfare obligations. My experience of this influenced my personal philosophy. I went on in Australia to develop disabled group housing which relieved the state of much of its financial burden by introducing Bill Glaser's Choice Theory approach to personal responsibility and self reliance, enabling previously highly dependent people to achieve personal independence and pride.


                  Fuggerei community housing - Augsburg
On the farm there was not much time for play, there was something for me to do wherever I went. What I liked most and what I remember from my earliest time was doing the chores in the farmhouse. Feeding the chickens, collecting eggs, feeding the pigs, cows and oxen. I loved keeping up the firewood to the kitchen and the huge oven in the living room. There was an abundance of berries to pick and fallen fruit to gather in the orchard; some for jam others for cider and my favourite, green-apple jelly.
As I got older, I was involved in all facets of the mixed farm operation. Harvest and planting were the busiest times, however preparing the soil in autumn and spring involved the spreading of stable manure to compost into the ploughed soil under the snow and then boost the new crop and pastures with liquid stable waste into the summer. Timing was the key at all stages to ensure a maximum quality harvest. 
The days were long and only Sundays and festival days were times of respite and fun. The morning would start at 4.30am with prayer, breakfast and then the trip to the fields for a sunrise start. Morning tea then a two hour lunch break at home to avoid the beat of the day. Usually the day would end at 6.30 to 7pm. Schooldays were a break in the routine once the wartime evacuations were over but holidays were long and hot on in the summer. 
It was towards the end of the evacuation period that I witnessed the bombing of Augsburg which annihilated half the city and most of its industry. 16 Jul 1944 A total of 1,087 B-17 Flying Fortress bombers USAAF Eighth Air Force attacked Germany in three waves (407, 238, and 407 bombers, respectively), escorted by 240, 214, and 169 fighters, respectively, with most of the bombers targeting Munich, Stuggart, Augsburg, and Saarbrucken; a total of 11 bombers and 3 fighters were lost. For 3 days after the bombing of Augsburg I witnessed a constant steam of people passing and visiting our farm in search of food.
                                       
                                   Destruction of Augsburg
Whatever else the defeat may have meant to the Germans, it meant that they were going to go hungry, probably for a long time; and they were hungry already. The SHAEF maximum daily ration for normal consumers was 1,550 calories, but the amounts actually being issued ranged from 804 calories in Hesse and Hesse-Nassau to 1,150 calories in parts of the Rhineland. The normal consumers were the new proletariat of the occupation. The gentry were the ""heavy"" and ""very heavy"" workers, railroad workers and miners for instance, who could get up to 2,800 calories. The out-and-out aristocrats were the self-suppliers, that is, the farmers, who did not have to trouble themselves with ration cards. The normal consumer was not starving, but if he subsisted entirely on his ration, which no one really expected him to do, he was very close to it. A typical week's ration issued during May of 1945 consisted of the following: bread, 3 pounds; meat, 4 ounces; butter and fat, 2 ounces; sugar, 7 ounces; macaroni and spaghetti, 5 ounces; potatoes, 6 pounds; some cereal (added to the children's ration), 6 ounces; milk (only for children up to six), 1 quart. The total was less than 1,000 calories per day, and the difference was made up by adding a few ounces of green vegetables ""provided trucks can be found to haul them and provided the people can eat rhubarb without sugar."" 

                                           
Permaculture using Keyline and Sloping Agricultural Land Technology
In Germany by the end of the war there were no men left! Then Polish and Russian prisoners who helped out during the war had returned home and my uncle, my father's brother, came back from Siberia in 1951. He was part of a three hundred thousand (300,000) man army captured by the Russians of which only 7,000 returned. He lived to age 86. When my cousin married, the agricultural land was added to her husband's estate as was the custom in rural inheritance practice.
When we arrived in Sydney Dec 25, 1952, it was a shock to observe the monotony of the country on the train journey from Sydney to Geelong in Victoria; a journey lasting beyond 24 hours. The countryside was either bush or brown gravel; the land had been overstocked and eaten down to the roots. The few remaining sheep mere skeletons; either living or dead. A scene I was never to forget. 
Ten years later, when I had my own farm, I rotated the cattle when they had eaten down to four or five centimetres with a layer of organic matter underneath that of at least 2cm to reduce evaporation and encourage the development of natural nutrients. The other thing that left me with a lasting impression was that every arable piece of ground and most of the slopes had been cleared of trees or ringbarked; the whole trip was dotted with thousands of bleached, decaying trunks that had been killed a hundred years before to promote growth of grass or wheat. Later, on our own property I promoted the growth of the most valuable trees and paid for the full purchase price with the trees I culled. Coincidentally, all old gnarled and twisted trees were left for homes and shelter for a diverse assortment of wildlife. I later had the property declared as a sanctuary. The trees have added 50 years of growth and remain there to this day. There were two major commercial benefits from this approach; The growth in timber added more value than the land was worth and later when I subdivided the property the blocks sold quicker and brought a better price than any surrounding, cleared subdivision.


I went to school in Australia for four years, worked on a farm after school every day and then for four years after I left school. After eight years I managed that farm and as my parting act-exported bulbs to Holland. We became so competitive that we bought out the other bulb growers in Geelong and supplied flower bulbs Australia wide. This was done by mechanising, improvising and economising. We saved labour costs by mechanising the sowing, weeding and harvesting process; then added value by refocusing the workers into adding value by grading and packaging for our customers. We conceived and manufactured specialised machines from old car and machinery parts and streamlined the packaging process. The greatest return came from developing the acquired land into smaller holdings or rural subdivisions as well as stocking the more viable 1,000 to 10,000 acre with mainly sheep from drought affected NSW.
In 1959 I left to complete my schooling and learn English by focusing on language and science in a four year BA Ed course. During this period I studied Australian farming methods and practices and concluded that most farmers in Australia don't enjoy the the lifestyle and quality of life of the average German farmer. The most successful operators  here are either large, mechanised and well schooled family organisations or companies employing agriculture and business graduates. After that are the traders who buy run down, debt or drought affected farms; engage in minimal farming, window dress and wait for a good season to sell.  In Germany, farms are long term enterprises.


             
                                      Rice planting - Philippines
Farming formed a large part of my life in Australia. All my experience, my study and my work centred around primary production, I exported meat and live sheep, studied tropical pasture development and the various uses of nitrogen fixing, leguminous shrubs and trees. I attended field days in Northern Queensland and the Northern Territory and the highlight in my memory was planning and conducting a 10 day tour of tropical farming enterprises. This involved Kings Ranch Fullers seeds and a day in Humpty Doo with James Gayoso catching wild buffalo for export. The tour was arranged for Seichi Kawai, the world's biggest emerald dealer at the time. His farm near Bogota spanned the size of a small country and he planned to develop this into a modern, productive agricultural enterprise. He imported farm machinery and seeds as well as cattle, suitable for tropical primary production.
Over the last 10 years here in The Philippines due to rapid population growth and the desperate need to feed this population, the forests have been degraded through the practice of slash and burn. The topsoil has been progressively lost and less than 20% of natural forest remains.  Rice is the mainstay and if the season is good the farmers eat until the next harvest. Competition from cheap imports of rice, the cost of production, especially the cost of fertiliser, has pushed them further into poverty. The typhoon wiped out more than 60% of the country's crop. With the help of a group of philanthropists, loosely formed into ""the One Good Idea Group"" I have moved to the Aklan  Region in the Philippines to introduce a comprehensive program designed to bring prosperity to these victims of centuries of archaic practices and finally a devastating storm. The key to this program is the introduction of high yielding Super Hybrid rice and from there the introduction of proven methods of Key-line farming, focusing on the use of organic fertiliser production and crop diversification.


                             Vegetable farming in Cebu
Now at the age of 75 I am engaged in the most ambitious and the most worthwhile endeavour of my life. I have seen the plight of the poor hill farmers in the provinces in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) and believe with the help of the team we have assembled that we can turn their lives around.
We can't do it alone, but together - with your help - we will change the world for the better.

Brian Martin, ESP Gallery Marrickville says:

       Wishing you well in all your goals & endeavours Manfred !
It was inspiring to meet you and I will always wish you safe passage as you go about your good works around the world.
My personal view is that if someone is making the world a better place, then I don’t care what beliefs or motivation drive them towards it. Results matter more than belief systems.
To anyone who does not know Manfred Kemter, he is a retired businessman from Australia, he originally came from Germany as a child, he has seen the worst that civilisation can do as a small child on the outskirts of Augsburg, and he has aspired to be the best that we can do as an adult. He has single-handedly brought prosperity to poor villagers in the Philippines after the devastation of cyclones in recent years.
I met Manfred because he lived across the back lane from ESP Gallery in Marrickville Sydney. We had many long discussions about humanitarian aid, and direct action.
I will miss Manfred’s discussions, but wish him the best of success with his direct action approach to fundraising and personally helping hill villages & Cooperatives with the introduction of high yielding Chinese Super Hybrid Rice and Key-line permaculture; ensuring their ongoing supply of food & income through improved cultivation practices and in partnership with progressive minds from the Department of Agrarian Reform and the University of Aklan to teach a shift in the perception of prosperity from having many children to education and entrepreneurship.

<p>Hermes is a messenger god of transitions and boundaries, according to Wikipedia, a crowdsourced online encyclopedia.  We are also creating a crowdsourced database, of diver temperatures and images.

In July of this year, during the World Ocean Summit in Lisbon, Cousteau
Divers met with <b>Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, Director of the Global Change
Institute at the University of Queensland (GCIQ)</b>, a world-class research organisation
dedicated to solving the mysteries of the ocean, especially in the light of the
rapid changes that are now occurring due to climate change. Speaking about the
power of citizen science, we quickly realised what we had in our hands.
Combining the Cousteau Divers community and reach to the University of
Queensland’s scientific network and connections with NOAA's Coral Reef Watch,
we can take the temperature of the ocean. Literally. <b>We <i>need </i>this
data in order to better manage marine resources at large.</b><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;""></span></p>
</div><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">Ocean and Climate</span><br/></p><p>The
ocean plays a crucial role in climate change and weather patterns. Current satellite
technology can only read the “skin” of the sea. Divers have the ability to help
monitor it in depth on a regular basis, thereby providing a new source of
scientific data, with myriads of applications.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438702220/g8sc5setgvswfvvtobdx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One example of the tremendous
importance of ocean temperatures is mass coral bleaching and mortality. As sea
temperatures rise, corals lose their photosynthetic symbiotic zooxanthellae, which
results in the coral suddenly whitening. Given that the zooxanthellae are a
critical source of food and nutrition for the coral, corals often starve and
die following mass coral bleaching. The images above were taken in American Samoa between December 2014 and April 2015 by Richard Vevers of <a href=""www.underwaterearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.underwaterearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underwater Earth</a>. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Due to climate change, ocean
temperatures are exceptionally warm across the planet. 2015-2016 promises to be
an El Niño year, meaning that warmer than normal temperatures are likely to
spread throughout the world, potentially devastating corals and impacting the
many life forms that live on them.</span>

Seventy
percent of our planet is one connected ocean. It produces half the oxygen we breathe and feeds over
one billion people.
Today the ocean is at risk,
losing biodiversity at an alarming rate due to pollution, overfishing, and
climate change. The ocean’s temperatures greatly influence our planet’s
climate, weather, fish stocks, bird populations. Ocean temperatures are steadily increasing yet our understanding of how
they vary at the scale of the ecosystems is largely unknown to science.Only the power of citizen
science and crowdsourcing can “plug this hole” in our understanding of how
temperature varies in the ocean. Without this knowledge, the management and
conservation of marine ecosystems is a “shot in the dark”.  It is a vital source of information that
governments, scientists, fisheries, and conservation organizations need if they
are going to understand this major threat to ocean life. Project Hermes is the first global effort to measure ocean temperatures worldwide at the scale of the ecosystem.  Since August 2015, Cousteau Divers and the University of Queensland spearhead this unique project. Using satellite sea surface temperature, diver’s computers and a collaborative, non-profit, open source software and database, Project Hermes will provide near real-time temperatures of the ocean, at depth, world-wide. We are producing a new source of scientific data. Please donate to equip 50 dive centres with reference temperature instruments and mine existing backlogs. Join us in exploring how the ocean behaves, on a human quest to bond a worldwide community of divers in saving what we love. Cousteau Divers is a citizen science  platform of divers (freedivers and scuba) united to study and protect the ocean. Together with NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch and the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, participate in solving some the greatest scientific mysteries and challenges of the ocean.Cousteau Divers

Project Hermes

Hermes is a messenger god of transitions and boundaries, according to Wikipedia, a crowdsourced online encyclopedia.  We are also creating a crowdsourced database, of diver temperatures and images. A guide to the underworld, Hermes is an appropriate reference for this project focused on detecting thermoclines.


In July of this year, during the World Ocean Summit in Lisbon, Cousteau
Divers met with Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, Director of the Global Change
Institute at the University of Queensland (GCIQ), a world-class research organisation
dedicated to solving the mysteries of the ocean, especially in the light of the
rapid changes that are now occurring due to climate change. Speaking about the
power of citizen science, we quickly realised what we had in our hands.
Combining the Cousteau Divers community and reach to the University of
Queensland’s scientific network and connections with NOAA's Coral Reef Watch,
we can take the temperature of the ocean. Literally. We need this
data in order to better manage marine resources at large.
Ocean and ClimateThe
ocean plays a crucial role in climate change and weather patterns. Current satellite
technology can only read the “skin” of the sea. Divers have the ability to help
monitor it in depth on a regular basis, thereby providing a new source of
scientific data, with myriads of applications.
On this daily map of sea surface temperatures (SST) we can see El Niño forming in the Pacific Ocean (the large red blob). As El Niño spreads across the world in the coming year, we will be able to monitor its effect on water temperatures at depth, which has tremendous scientific value. www.coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/vs/map.php



One example of the tremendous
importance of ocean temperatures is mass coral bleaching and mortality. As sea
temperatures rise, corals lose their photosynthetic symbiotic zooxanthellae, which
results in the coral suddenly whitening. Given that the zooxanthellae are a
critical source of food and nutrition for the coral, corals often starve and
die following mass coral bleaching. The images above were taken in American Samoa between December 2014 and April 2015 by Richard Vevers of Underwater Earth. Due to climate change, ocean
temperatures are exceptionally warm across the planet. 2015-2016 promises to be
an El Niño year, meaning that warmer than normal temperatures are likely to
spread throughout the world, potentially devastating corals and impacting the
many life forms that live on them.

In addition to our core partner at the University of Queensland, we are working with the following partners. NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch uses some of the most advanced technology in the world to monitor the sea surface temperatures from satellites. DAN Europe’s Diving Safety Laboratory is the leading diver safety research organisation in Europe and has been collecting diving temperatures for a decade, with over 60,000 diver data profiles in stock. This data will be anonymously fed into the Hermes software to obtain a 10-year backlog of sea temperatures. We will organise a hackathon to explore programming solutions and practical applications of this new data.
All of these partners, and more, are helping us make Project Hermes a reality with in-kind contributions. All data collected and processed is made open source and shared among all project partners and the public. We hope to present preliminary findings in time for the United Nations Climate Summit (COP21) in Paris, this December, where the leaders of the world will gather. We will shed new light on how the ocean influences climate, a missing piece of the puzzle.



From aerospace engineers and graphic designers to oceanographers and developers, we're now a team of a dozen excited people allocating brain bandwidth to this revolutionary project.

Last but certainly not least, we can't do any of this without the active contributions of the future 50 Cousteau Dive centres. Above is a selection of 15 applicant dive centres who will join the program from all over the world in 2016!  All dive centres can join, and we hope to have as many as possible contributing data to Project Hermes soon. Membership is free. Know any dive centres who want to help monitor the ocean? 

Join us and change the world! 
Each Cousteau Dive centre will receive a set of three instruments: a Site Station, to monitor temperature at a constant depth for months at a time; a Temperature Logger, to be worn by the centre's dive master/instructor who is in the water most frequently; a universal dive computer connector, to upload diver's profiles.
In January 2016, the Cousteau Dive centres will receive a branding package and they will be promoted on the new website.

Open source

All
data collected and processed is made open source and shared among all project
partners and the public. Contributor feedback loops help retain data providers.

We are non-profit, non-governmental, and open-source. We believe mankind needs this information in order to better manage its resources, and we have found a way of making it technically and financially possible, today.
Cousteau Divers and Dive centres are observers and observatories of marine life world-wide. We are raising funds to deploy calibration temperature loggers in all Cousteau Dive centres.

Funding and targets

Project Hermes is currently bootstrapped by Cousteau Divers and the Global Change

contributions. Funding will help keep the platform free and
maintained, and develop this new field of study, by improving satellite and diver data synchronising and calibrating devices, as well as developing new technologies, hiring dedicated staff, and organising an international hackathon.

Our global target for this campaign is to raise $ 42,500
 (between both international and Dutch campaigns) 


The Indiegogo campaign aims to support the deployment of temperature equipment in 35 Cousteau Dive centres. The Dutch campaign supports the remaining 15 Cousteau Dive centres.
Temperature loggers and site stations will help us model the behaviour of ocean temperatures around the dive centre as well as to model error margins of dive computers. The universal dive computer adapters will help collect more data from divers visiting the Cousteau Dive centre. The server is needed to host all this new data, and manpower is necessary to handle shipping and coordination of dive centres.


Over the top!
If we manage to raise more than the target $ 42,500, the combined ""extra"" proceeds from both campaigns will go to the following, in order:
- Develop the Hermes software to process all this new data (est. $ 25,000). This software will collect data, match it with satellite and calibration data, and dispatch the product globally. Cousteau Divers and the University of Queensland are currently bootstrapping this development, but it can't go fast without further funding!
- Organise the Hack the Ocean hackathon (est. $ 15,000), to perform exploratory programming using anonymous diver temperature profiles and satellite data.

- Start desining new hardware that is specific to this project (est. $ 25,000). We'll start making our own temperature instruments, specifically tailored to our need, to improve the ease-of-use and accuracy of our temperature measurements.

What we're doing right now 
Cousteau Divers is launching a new Web site in October designed to showcase the Cousteau Dive centres and receive their data, and CGIQ-CRW are defining the requirements for the software to match satellite with diver data. DAN Europe is carrying out the necessary calibration modelling of commercial dive computers. NOAA CRW is designing the software solution concepts and volunteers are helping with coding and visualisation.

 We are excited to be working toward the goal of installing a 40kW solar array on the roof of our church.  This crowdfunding campaign gives an opportunity for others both near and far to partner with us as we continue to Care for Creation, Care for our Community and Invest Responsibly. 

We are the congregation of Saint Anthony Park Lutheran Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.   Located on the corner of Como Avenue and Luther Place, we have a visible and social presence in the heart of this neighborhood community.
 Our recent investment in a new roof along with the church's optimum solar orientation makes this a perfect time to implement a rooftop solar project.
We have been awarded the Made In Minnesota solar incentive.  This incentive is estimated to pay more than half of the cost of the project over 10 years, but first we have to raise funds for the entire project.
With your help this broader outreach campaign will raise $10,000 (~8% of the total project cost).
Donations are tax-deductible. A receipt will be emailed to you immediately upon confirmation of your donation.
   Project Support Please consider supporting our project in the following ways:  An easy and effective form of support is by simply sharing our campaign with your social media network.  By reposting and/or sharing our campaign on  Facebook and/or Twitter you can help broaden the awareness of our project. In return for your monetary support there are several ways we would like to say thank you.  We are excited to offer these perks that are meant not only to encourage your donation but also to illustrate the importance and effectiveness of renewable energy.  The perks for donating will primarily be knowledge-based
activities that will not tap into project funds. Every dollar you donate

reduces real carbon emissions in Minnesota, while also being a tax-deductible
gift. Over 30 years it is estimated to save the church over $257,000 in energy costs.
Annually this 40kW solar array will;
 produce about 50% of the church's electric use.
will offset ~73,800 pounds of carbon dioxide (equivalent to 3,950 trees)


Beyond the physical and fiscal impacts we hope this project

</p><h3>What is Crimson Fuel?</h3>
<p>Crimson Fuel is the brainchild of Scott Morris, a small business
entrepreneur with a vision for economic freedom for America.</p>
<p>Oil, namely the imported stuff, has a noose around the American economy and
culture. We consume so much of it that by eliminating about 20%, we could turn
our trade deficit into a trade surplus. This would have a cascading effect on
the economy, and impact every single American.</p>
<p>There is a fuel that <strong>COSTS as much as 40% LESS per mile driven</strong>,
and can easily replace gasoline, without requiring you to buy a new car or pay
to have yours converted, and can be sold at the gas stations we already have in
America. There is no need to build out an enormous infrastructure and change
the lives and habits of American consumers.</p>
<p>Methanol is that solution. Methanol can be made from almost anything, with
cost and waste products as the limiting factors. Currently, natural gas is the
most viable feedstock and will be for many years to come. But coal is a close
second, and we have a LOT of that too.</p>
<p>Between natural gas and coal, we have enough resources in the USA alone to fuel every vehicle in the USA, accounting
for growth, for the next 400 YEARS!</p>
<h3>Our Plan</h3>
<p>We will open/acquire gas stations in carefully selected locations, that will
install this kit and convert cars for free, with a patented and EPA approved
conversion kit that also comes with a full warranty against any damage to your
engine. Those consumers will then simply fill up at our station for as much as
40% less than they pay for gas every month. If they are not in range of one of
our stations, they can simply put gas in the car as they always have. Pretty
simple really. We don’t need to build special stations or undergo any massive
change to make this happen. We simply need to enable your car to run on this
superior fuel, and then sell it to you. When you fill up, you are contributing
to the economic prosperity of America,
and our national security by not sending dollars overseas.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help to build a consumer outcry and demand that rallies the
people to adopt a new fuel that will rid us of the stranglehold of the oil
cartel.<br/><br/>
We already have the support of a major methanol manufacturer to the tune of
$200,000, provided we can raise the remaining $300,000, and we need to raise it
from the American people to make a statement that this is what America
wants…freedom from oil and sending dollars overseas that ultimately fund
terrorism against our homeland.</p>
<p>Show corporate America
and the investment and venture capital community that their investment is worth
it.<br/><br/>
Your dollars show a type of bona fide support that the investment community
will not be able to ignore. This will enable us to campaign for the larger
investment dollars we need to open thousands of stations across the USA. If your
dollar is behind it, the investment dollars are easy to justify.<br/><br/>
America
is supposed to be a free market. A truly free market allows various products to
compete. With methanol, we will never be hog-tied to a single source for our
fuel. If natural gas gets too expensive, we can simply make it from something
else. The producer that makes the methanol that meets the consumer demand will
win the market share, and deservingly so. If they fail to keep up, then another
one will move in and take that market share away. This is how the American free
market is supposed to work.<br/><br/>
We need you to support this with a few bucks to make sure this gets off the
ground. The government is too heavily influenced by big oil lobby money. We
need you, the people to put your dollars behind this and show them they cannot
control us anymore. It is a true revolution, fought with your dollars.<br/><br/>
Become a Crimson Fuel Revolutionary with your support.<br/><br/>
Every supporter will have the opportunity to submit their photo and a short
statement on why they chose to support Crimson Fuel. These will be featured on
mini video screen on our pumps at our stations, and in our commercials and
marketing campaigns, encouraging other Americans to join in creating freedom in
the American vehicle fuel marketplace that has never before existed.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times are tough. Maybe you just can’t contribute directly, but that doesn’t
mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word out and make
     some noise about the American Economic Revolution and Crimson Fuel.</li>
<li>Be sure to use the Indiegogo
     share tools to get the word out to everyone you know. This is a way to
     make a real difference in America!</li>

La
Conserva della neve è una mostra-mercato
floro vivaistica che ospita
esclusivamente vivai da collezione scelti tra i migliori del panorama
italiano ed europeo e personaggi internazionali tra artisti, studiosi
e architetti del paesaggio. La manifestazione, giunta alla XII
edizione, ha luogo ogni
anno nel mese di settembre.
Tre giorni no-stop con orario di apertura al pubblico dalle 09:00
alle 19:30. Dal 2002 al 2009 la mostra si è tenuta a Viterbo
all’interno del parco storico di Villa Lante di Bagnaia, uno dei
più famosi giardini all'italiana del XVI secolo. Dal 2010 si è
spostata a Roma nella splendida cornice di Villa
Borghese
all’interno del Parco
dei Daini.
Quest'anno l'evento si terrà il 19,
20 e 21 settembre 2014.


La
Conserva della neve is a floriculture
trade fair that
exclusively hosts nurseries chosen from collections among the best of
the Italian and European panoramas, as well as international artists,
scholars and landscape architects. The event takes place once a year
in the month of September for three days non-stop, and is joined with
this year’s 12th
edition.
The exhibition was held in Viterbo inside of the historic park of
Villa Lante di Bagnaia, one of the most famous Italian gardens of the
16th century, from 2002 to 2009. In 2010 it relocated to Rome in the
splendid setting of Villa
Borghese inside
of Parco
dei Daini.This
year the event will take place on the 19th,
20th and 21st of September 2014, from 9:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.


Una
kermesse completamente rivolta al mondo del verde, con oltre 120
espositori da tutto il mondo,
dove è possibile acquistare piante, trovare tutte le novità del
settore e scambiare informazioni difficilmente reperibili nei
circuiti tradizionali. É
questo che rende La Conserva della neve un
evento unico in Italia e in Europa.


This
is a kermesse aimed exclusively at the green world, with more than
120
international exhibitors.
Here it is possible to purchase plants, to discover all of the
novelties of the sector and to exchange information not easily found
in traditional circuits. This is what makes La Conserva della neve a
unique event in Italy and Europe. 

L'importanza
culturale e divulgativa della manifestazione è ampiamente dimostrata
dalla sempre maggiore affluenza di pubblico soprattutto giovane in
particolare studenti in Scienze Agrarie, Scienze Forestali,
Architettura del Paesaggio, scolaresche, ma anche dalle famiglie e
dai numerosi appassionati del verde, sia amatori che professionisti.
Dalle 3.000 presenze della I edizione nel 2002 si è giunti a 15.000
visitatori nel 2013.


The cultural and
educational importance of the event is amply demonstrated by the
growing affluence of the mostly young public, particularly students
of the Agrarian Sciences, Forest Sciences and Landscape Architecture.
Other guests include families and numerous individuals, hobbyists and
professionals alike, passionate about the ‘green.’ Attendance has
gone from 3,000 present in the 1st edition in 2002 to 15,000
visitors in 2013.


La
manifestazione ha contribuito in questi anni all’attuazione in
Italia di nuovi vivai specializzati, è riuscita a sostenere la
creazione di fondazioni scientifiche  per la salvaguardia della
biodiversità vegetale di specie appartenenti al nostro territorio
nazionale e a coadiuvare le associazioni internazionali che operano
soprattutto nei paesi in via di sviluppo per promuovere
un’agricoltura sostenibile, migliorare la qualità della vita
quotidiana, valorizzare i saperi tradizionali, fare economia.


In the past few years, this event has
contributed to the fulfillment of new specialized horticulturists and
has succeed in sustaining the creation of scientific foundations for
the safeguarding of plant biodiversity of species belonging to our
national territory. We have co-operated with international
associations that operate in developing countries to promote
sustainable agriculture, to improve the quality of daily life, to
economize and to value traditional know-how. 

Chi
siamo / Who we are
La
Conserva della neve è un'Associazione
non profit
che promuove e organizza l'omonima manifestazione culturale,
allo scopo di far conoscere al pubblico italiano e straniero
le nuove forme di arte e architettura del paesaggio e diffondere
il concetto di “biodiversità” vegetale.
La
Conserva della neve is a non-profit
association that
promotes and organizes the cultural event of the same name, with the
goal of rendering new forms of art and landscape architecture known
to the Italian public, as well as to diffuse
the concept of plant ‘biodiversity.’
Oltre
a questa finalità, l'Associazione ha posto uguale interesse verso
tutte le attività e creazioni rivolte al mondo del verde e del
paesaggio sottolineando l'importanza di figure professionali quali
ricercatori, studiosi, architetti del paesaggio, agronomi,
associazioni, artisti, scrittori, a cui ha sempre dedicato un posto
di primo piano.


But
that’s not all. The Association has geared an equal amount of
interest towards all of the activities and creations dedicated to
landscapes and to the green world, emphasizing the importance of
professional figures such as researchers, scholars, landscape
architects, agronomists, associations, artists and writers, to which
it has always dedicated a spot in the foreground.Nel
2011 è stata invitata ad un gemellaggio con il salone del
Florovivaismo Florexpo alla Nuova Fiera di Roma; inoltre è stata
chiamata a collaborare alla realizzazione delle edizioni 2011 e 2012
della manifestazione ""Era di Maggio…"", svoltesi alla
Galleria Nazionale di Arte Antica di Palazzo Corsini alla Lungara a
Roma. 



In
2011, the association was invited to a twinning event at the Florexpo
at the Nuova Fiera of Rome. It was also called to collaborate in the
realization of the 2011 and 2012 editions of  the “Era di
Maggio...” event, at the National
Gallery of Antique Art in the Corsini Palace
in Rome. Le
ultime quattro edizioni svoltesi nel Parco dei Daini di Villa
Borghese, divenuto la sede definitiva della mostra, hanno creato un
ottimo e costruttivo rapporto
tra la manifestazione ed il Comune di Roma rappresentato dalla
Soprintendenza Beni Culturali (Direzione
Ville e Parchi Storici) e
il Servizio Giardini.Questa
collaborazione si concretizza ogni anno nella
fornitura annuale delle specie storiche di bulbose, erbacee ed
arboree per i Giardini Segreti da
parte della manifestazione e nelle visite guidate dal personale
comunale ai Giardini Segreti per i visitatori della mostra.


The
past four editions have taken place in Parco dei Daini in Villa
Borghese, which has become the definitive location of the exhibition.
They have created an optimal and constructive relationship
between the individuals involved in the event and the Commune of
Rome, represented by the government department responsible for
cultural goods (direction
of villas and historic parks) and
the Servizio Giardini.This
collaboration manifests itself every year in the annual supplying
of historic species such as bulbs,
herbaceous and tree crops for the Giardini Segreti on
behalf of the event, as well as in the guided visits of the Giardini
Segreti provided by the personnel of the commune. Ciò
grazie alla passione e alla coraggiosa caparbietà delle sue socie
fondatrici Lusi
Nesbitt, Presidente
dell'Associazione, imprenditore nonché Grande Ufficiale al Merito della Repubblica
Italiana e Maria
Cristina Leonardi,
Agronomo Paesaggista, le quali spendono ogni anno gran parte delle loro energie e
del loro tempo per mantenere sempre alto il livello qualitativo della
mostra. 



This
is all thanks to the passion and to the courageous stubbornness
of the founding associates, Lusi
Nesbitt, President
of the Association, entrepreneur and “Grande
Ufficiale al Merito della Repubblica Italiana“ and Maria
Cristina Leonardi,
Agronomist-Landscape Architect, which spends a
large part of its time and energy each year constantly maintaining
the high qualitative
level of the show.

<h2>THE AUSTRALASIAN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION 2013-2014</h2>
<p>2013-2014 marks the centenary of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by the great scientist and explorer Sir Douglas Mawson. In a celebration of this remarkable endeavour, the new Australasian Antarctic Expedition (or AAE for short) will follow the route of its namesake, melding science and adventure, to discover and communicate the changes that have taken place in this remote environment over the last hundred years.</p>
<p>Led by Professor Chris Turney and Dr Chris Fogwill, from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, the 2013-2014 expedition will attempt to revisit the site of the original AAE huts at Cape Denison, Antarctica, the enigmatically named <strong>‘Home of the Blizzard’</strong>. However, recent attempts to access the area have been thwarted by the presence of a large iceberg, which in 2010 lodged itself across the bay. Over the last three years an extensive area of sea ice has built up within the bay, effectively barring ships from entering the harbour at Cape Denison but potentially making it possible to access the site over its surface with all-terrain vehicles (popularly known as ATVs). We have chosen to attempt the crossing using ARGOs, unique eight-wheeled amphibious vehicles. We aim to access this scientifically and historically significant site, <strong>but to make this possible we need your help!</strong></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To support our attempt to cross the sea ice and access Cape Denison we have secured two ARGOs in collaboration with ARGO ATV (Aus). However, to maximize the chances of our success in this remote region we need to secure at least one more ARGO.  We have selected the ARGO 8x8 Frontier, an amphibious all terrain utility vehicle designed for reliability in the toughest conditions.  The main chassis has been engineered using field-proven technology, allowing for increased payloads and greater durability under the harshest of conditions. This will allow us to tow large loads across the ice to support biological and environmental science projects below, on and above the ice.</p>
<p>Including snow tracks, winch system and operator covers, one of these ATVs costs a total of <strong>$37,919</strong>, critical to the success of this part of the expedition. If we exceed this target we may be able to get two Argos, improving our chances of getting in and allowing us to do more science on the sea ice! If we fall under our target, we will look to purchase a smaller model.</p>
<p>The concept of crowd funding with Indiegogo harks back to Mawson‘s original Antarctic expedition one hundred years ago, where many expedition items — including huskies, tents and sleeping bags — were funded by schools and public donations from across the world! To attract potential supporters we are able to offer a number of unique gifts and perks, ranging from limited edition t-shirts, exclusive photographic prints and the opportunity to join us virtually on the ice; you can even have an Argo named after you, your club, society or business!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 is all about adventure, exploration, scientific discovery, and importantly communication. The AAE aims to engage with a broad audience live from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean throughout the expedition. Through a variety of media, including Google+ Hangouts on Air, Twitter and YouTube, we will broadcast live from Antarctica using the latest satellite technology to support live streaming from the ice.  </p>
<p>The Antarctic remains one of the last great unexplored regions on our planet. In spite of over a century of discovery – including aerial and satellite surveys – remarkably little of this great continent has been explored on the ground. Crucially this pristine southern polar region is uniquely placed to monitor the health of our planet. <strong>The Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE) will focus its efforts on the Antarctic Commonwealth Bay and subantarctic islands to provide the first complete snapshot of this region for a century.</strong></p>
<p>The AAE has identified a team of scientists who are world experts in the natural and physical sciences while also being passionate about science communication. The research programmes to be undertaken include:</p>
<p><em>1. Oceanography:</em> The Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in global climate and the carbon cycle. 90% of the world’s excess heat trapped by the atmosphere is going into the ocean and changing circulation patterns, threatening to turn the region into a source of carbon, exaggerating future warming. <strong>The AAE will make detailed measurements on the passage south (e.g. temperature, salinity, carbon) to determine just how sensitive the Southern Ocean is to change.</strong></p>
<p><em>2. Climate: </em>The ‘screaming sixties’, the ‘furious fifties’ and the ‘roaring forties’ filled sailors of old with dread. And yet these fearsome westerly winds are migrating inexorably southwards taking warmer water with them, threatening the stability of Antarctic ice. <strong>The AAE will collect peat, ice and rock samples to place satellite data in the context of the past millennia.</strong></p>
<p><em>3. Biology: </em>Recent expeditions to the Southern Ocean and Antarctica continue to report the discovery of thousands of new species, while living and ‘fossil’ animal and plant remains provide a sensitive measure of the changing environment. <strong>The AAE will observe, document and monitor the wildlife above and below the Antarctic ice, giving new insights into this unexplored region.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>By supporting our campaign and making it possible for our team to reach Cape Denison, you will be helping us to achieve our scientific goals and extend our work onto continental Antarctica. The Argos will make it possible for us to support science on the ice in this remote and hostile environment, thus providing a unique perspective for understanding and communicating the changes going on in this remote part of our planet over the past century.  </strong></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Join us  in launching a grassroots campaign celebrating and calling on solar developers to build solar farms
that include habitat for monarch butterflies, honey bees, bumblebees, and other important
pollinators. 

Monarch and bee populations are in crisis and the best way to help is to create more habitat. 
Developers can easily and cost-effectively incorporate region-specific deep-rooted grasses and wildflowers in the land management practices for solar farms. What's needed is a small change in the planning/building process to evaluate the costs of hauling in and maintaining gravel versus other ground cover crops.


     

What We Need  The monarch butterfly population is at the lowest-recorded level in our lifetimes, and our honey bee and bumblebee pollinators that we rely on for our fruits and vegetables also are in serious decline
At a neighborhood level, everyone is encouraged to plant pollinator gardens. Solar sites are an opportunity to create millions of ""pollinator gardens"" throughout the United States.
 Base Goal $5,500An ad in a national solar industry trade magazine
Stretch Goal $24,000A full-page ad in a prominent regional newspaper and an ad in a national solar industry trade magazine



The ImpactMinnesota alone will build 2,500 acres of solar farms over the next two construction seasons — equivalent to more than 750,000 12'x12' backyard bee & monarch gardens.
With your support, the five largest companies building these solar farms will include honeybee and monarch habitat on all of these sites, establishing a best-practice standard to be implemented nationwide.



Use of Funds / Campaign Thanks

As a 501(c)3, with a 25-year track record of work in the public interest, Fresh Energy will receive a nonprofit rate for buying the ad and all funds raised will be used for the ad campaign and the organization's work related to it. If the base goal is not met, we will find a lower-cost ad placement. Funds that exceed one goal, but don't achieve another will be used for a lower-cost ad campaign.

Patagonia St. Paul has generously donated a special gift that will be given to someone drawn at random that has supported this campaign or entered to win. All campaign donors will be eligible. To enter at no cost, send a postcard with your name and address to Fresh Energy at 408 St. Peter St., St. Paul, MN 55102.    

    Other Ways You Can Help You can chip in toward the financial goal, and we would also love your help in getting the word out. Here are some sample tweets/Facebook posts you can copy/paste:

<h3>My Clean City </h3>
<p>My Clean City is a national environmental program that strives to provide youth with progressive volunteer opportunities, positive leadership experiences, and impacting community involvements in the environmental sector. We are a leadership program run by youth for youth, with measurable results.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the potential of young people to make our world a better place. There are so many incredible resources and community programs dedicated to improving our environment, but lack active youth engagement. Rather than add to the overflowing sector, My Clean City strives to strengthen the existing efforts of committed organizations. We are a collaborative project that works with existing environmental organizations, and grassroot programs to engage, enable and evaluate youth volunteer actions with the goal of building a more environmentally sustainable future.</p>
<p>As the catalyst between non-profit organizations and today’s youth, My Clean City will provide a unified portal for like-minded individuals to access all of these opportunities and realize as a team the big difference many small actions can make!<br/></p>

<p>Differing from other environmental initiatives, My Clean City is a merit and results-based endeavor; beyond simply raising awareness of core environmental issues and problems, My Clean City strives to quantify youth impact through the recording of results and the crediting of volunteers and organizations that assist in environmental goals.

<p>An integral pillar of our program is to acknowledge the work of young Canadian leaders. Through our CleanCred system, we strive to reward our passionate young environmental ambassadors for their hard work. </p>
<p>CleanCreds are based on both effort (volunteer time donated) and impact (positive effect in our community); those with the highest cumulative total at the end of our program will be awarded scholarships and mentorship opportunities to grow their impact to the next level.</p>

<p>$5000 is the bare minimum we need for our scholarships. This will only cover a $500/province scholarship. </p>
<p>Ideally we would like to offer at least $1000/province which would require us to raise $10,000.</p>
<p>Even better, with your generous support if you help us surpass this goal, we will be able to open up our scholarships to recognize more young leaders in your region.</p>
