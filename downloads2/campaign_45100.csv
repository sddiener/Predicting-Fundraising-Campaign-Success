<p><b>A little bit about me...</b></p>
<p>My name is Heidi Owens, and I've been making jewelry and painting silk since I was a teenager in the early 80's.  I've placed many things on hold to raise my three beautiful and very artistic daughters, but never gave up my love of beads, stones and silk painting.  As a single mother, I began to do the thing I love most as a way to earn extra income in the spring of 2012, and found myself nominated for accessories designer of the year in Oklahoma City through the RAW Independent artists program by November.  </p>

<p>If we don't raise the $3000 in this campaign, we still intend to create the Spring/Summer/Resort 2014 line, and take it to San Antonio on October 21st if possible.  Every opportunity to remind someone that they are beautiful and wonderfully made is important.<br/></p>
<p><b>The bigger picture...</b></p>
<p>We have a tremendous vision to sow into others. Our goal for the future is to mentor young mothers and encourage them to complete their education, follow their creativity, and keep dreaming and aspiring for great things.  We also have a desire to enter into a ""fair trade"" type of relationship with a village in Pakistan and help them establish economy in the village by purchasing fabrics, beads and other things they are able to make.  We hope this will be the first of many projects of this nature.</p>

Watch hands have brushed surface along with outer rings of sunray concentric sub-dials. The dial has applied volume index marks covered with luminous paint and consists of three independent layers, each with its own time unit to show.One of the coolest features is a domed mineral glass which lets to read the dial most spectacular way and supports overall vintage outlook. Date window has a magnifying lens on itself.Edmonton Noir is a special limited edition of our Plan B watches. It has black brushed steel dial with handcrafted black date window and stylish green luminous coating. Noir comes with a black genuine leather strap and black steel mesh band. There will be only 50 pieces of Edmonton Noir.Plan B case has an aerodynamic rounded shape inspired with french watchmaking of mid 1950-s and made of high grade composite stainless steel - the best material available in our price range. It is topped with domed panoramic glass which lets you enjoy Edmonton series vintage design in its full beauty. By the way the case was created from scratch, through a lot of research and hot debates. Every single detail was developed thoroughly, even the shape of lugs! Precision and reliability of prime watch function is also a vital matter for us. Plan B watches house accurate quartz movement with two chronographs, four jewels and gold coating. Also an outstanding battery life terms — 54 months! We love what we do so much that we spent a lot of time picking most comfy and convenient watch crown and chrono buttons!Our project means frequent strap change, so we needed to find lasting and durable decision for our straps. That's why we've picked dyed canvas and leather for basic strap and Milanese mesh steel for secondary one. These kinds of straps can easily last for ages even if you are going to change them on your Plan B every day!Case Diameter: 43 mm Case Thickness: 9 mm Band Material: Dyed canvas/leather and Milanese mesh stainless steelBand Max/Min Length: 215 mm / 155 mm Band Width: 20 mm Total Weight: 55 grCase / Backcase Material : 316L Stainless steel Strap buckle: 316L Stainless steel Glass: Crystal Mineral glass Water Resistant: 5 ATM / 50 MetersMovement:  QuartzOur backers will have the sweetest deals!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Same Old Expressions - Who they hell are we?</h3>
<p>Simply put, we are a company that believes unflinchingly in transparency about our faults, being purposeful (our purpose is NOT our side hustle), and the highest level of commitment (we call that quality assurance in blood).<br/><br/>This campaign is meant to put these beliefs to the test. This campaign is meant to put our ideas and product into the world and see if you agree that this is worth starting.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED:</strong> If what you've read and what you've seen speaks to you, if you're into what's going on here whether from a conscious stand point, or because it's just your style of fun, then ... choose the perk level you want based on how many designs you want (1-6). After you select the tier and pay, I'll message you directly and get the exact designs you want and the sizes you want.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The shirts are . . .</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>100% Organic cotton</strong> - because cotton is 4% of the world's crops, yet accounts for 25% of the world's pesticide use (that sits on your body, all day, impacts the world, and those that work in the fields)</p>
<p><strong>Locally</strong><strong> Designed in Crown Heights</strong> - aka I'm either on my couch or elsewhere in BK doodling, then I scan it, auto-trace, send to the printer, pick up my shirts a few days later</p>
<p><strong>Locally Printed at BKNY Printing</strong> - the short coming here is that the ink is plastisol which is not earth friendly like water based inks. But as you'll read later on, we won't hide our faults.</p>
<p>Since our values are some of the main reasons we think you'll end up giving a sh*t about what we got going on, check out the short explanations below before you get into the designs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>1.</strong> <strong>PURPOSEFULLY TRANSPARENT</strong></p>
<p>Everyone and everything is imperfect.</p>
<p>Yet even the most conscious companies really only focus on the sunny side of their efforts.<br/><br/>We at Same Old Expressions believe that there is too much to be learned and shared from failure and mistake to keep them to ourselves. As well, everyone and everything is a product of the good and the bad, so why try and pretend any company is all good? or hell, even all bad?<br/><br/><strong>We will be 100% transparent about . . .</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>How everything is made</strong><ul>
<li>Organic cotton</li>
<li>Platisol ink (not earth friendly like water based inks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Where it comes from</strong><ul>
<li>Econscious t-shirts purchased on jonestshirts.com</li>
<li>Designed on a sheet of paper and styled in Illustrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What your money is going towards - costs, re-investment, profit, donations, all of it</strong><ul><li>For this campaign it is all reinvested in the company, but you will receive a breakdown of where your money went upon the successful completion of the campaign</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tests we run, why we ran them, the results </strong><ul><li>Right now, this is the test</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What we learn along the way</strong><ul><li>Looking forward to check'n back with you here</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">​<strong>everything right and wrong with what we do, when we do it</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>In short . . . errrything</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>2. TRANSPARENTLY PURPOSEFUL</strong></p>
<p>What we stand for, why we exist, and why we think you just might want to give a sh*t, will never be hard to discern.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, we stand for these 3 principles and believe that if this value system permeated other companies we would all be living in a far different world.<br/><br/>Our purpose will develop over time, but before we go saving the world one organic t-shirt at a time, we're going to focus on a successful launch, then take it from there. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>3. QUALITY ASSURANCE IN BLOOD</strong></p>
<p>We would never ask you to put our designs on your body if we didn't whole heartedly believe in them.<br/><br/>Designs will have a set goal. Once sales reach that number I will be getting that design tattooed on my body.<br/><br/>It's not a gimmick, but instead, it is our ""quality assured in blood"" to you. This is a chance for you to participate in the direct reflection of our commitment to you, in a way that no other company allows people to participate. <br/><br/>Want in? Then bear with me, keep on reading on . . .<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Quality Assured in Blood - The Tattoo Goal</strong></p>
<p>In this crowd funding campaign, each contribution will be your active vote and participation in the process. Each shirt you purchase is your vote for the winning design. The first of many designs to be assured in blood.<br/><br/>1. Choose your contribution tier based on the number of shirts you want to get</p>
<p>2. Then, I will follow up to get all of the details about . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>specific designs</li>
<li>sizes</li>
<li>whether male or female style</li>
</ul>
<p>. . . and keep the tally going as we count down to $2400.</p>
<p><br/>The design with the most contributions will be the tattoo that I get. As well, any design that gets greater than 23<strong>*</strong> contributions will also become a tattoo on my body. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>*Why &gt; 23 contributions? </strong></p>
<p>Because it allows me to produce shirts in the next tier of reduced costs from the company that I get the 100% organic shirts from, and from the local printer that we work with. Thus, those cost reductions will be reinvested in our commitments to you and the community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our goals and aims are bigger than this, but this is where we start. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It would be an honor if what we stand for resonates with you.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Honesty: Where the money goes - each shirt</h3>
<p>First off, there are fixed costs . . .</p>
<p><strong>Blank shirts</strong> = $8.51/shirt</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Printing cost/design</strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> (12-23 shirts same design) = $10/shirt</span></p>
<p>. . . From there I will follow up to discuss the specific plans of where the difference between the costs to me and the costs to you go. This clarity down to the exact fraction of a penny is crucial to me. I want you to know exactly what you've invested in because that's what you're doing, investing. <br/><br/>You are investing in a company, in an idea, in a future populated by the type of businesses and people that you want to see.</p>

</div></div>","Same Old Expressions - Who they hell are we?
Simply put, we are a company that believes unflinchingly in transparency about our faults, being purposeful (our purpose is NOT our side hustle), and the highest level of commitment (we call that quality assurance in blood).This campaign is meant to put these beliefs to the test. This campaign is meant to put our ideas and product into the world and see if you agree that this is worth starting.
HOW TO GET INVOLVED: If what you've read and what you've seen speaks to you, if you're into what's going on here whether from a conscious stand point, or because it's just your style of fun, then ... choose the perk level you want based on how many designs you want (1-6). After you select the tier and pay, I'll message you directly and get the exact designs you want and the sizes you want.
The shirts are . . .
100% Organic cotton - because cotton is 4% of the world's crops, yet accounts for 25% of the world's pesticide use (that sits on your body, all day, impacts the world, and those that work in the fields)
Locally Designed in Crown Heights - aka I'm either on my couch or elsewhere in BK doodling, then I scan it, auto-trace, send to the printer, pick up my shirts a few days later
Locally Printed at BKNY Printing - the short coming here is that the ink is plastisol which is not earth friendly like water based inks. But as you'll read later on, we won't hide our faults.
Since our values are some of the main reasons we think you'll end up giving a sh*t about what we got going on, check out the short explanations below before you get into the designs.
1. PURPOSEFULLY TRANSPARENT
Everyone and everything is imperfect.
Yet even the most conscious companies really only focus on the sunny side of their efforts.We at Same Old Expressions believe that there is too much to be learned and shared from failure and mistake to keep them to ourselves. As well, everyone and everything is a product of the good and the bad, so why try and pretend any company is all good? or hell, even all bad?We will be 100% transparent about . . .


How everything is made
Organic cotton
Platisol ink (not earth friendly like water based inks)



Where it comes from
Econscious t-shirts purchased on jonestshirts.com
Designed on a sheet of paper and styled in Illustrator



What your money is going towards - costs, re-investment, profit, donations, all of itFor this campaign it is all reinvested in the company, but you will receive a breakdown of where your money went upon the successful completion of the campaign


Tests we run, why we ran them, the results Right now, this is the test


What we learn along the wayLooking forward to check'n back with you here


​everything right and wrong with what we do, when we do it
In short . . . errrything
2. TRANSPARENTLY PURPOSEFUL
What we stand for, why we exist, and why we think you just might want to give a sh*t, will never be hard to discern.
Out of the gate, we stand for these 3 principles and believe that if this value system permeated other companies we would all be living in a far different world.Our purpose will develop over time, but before we go saving the world one organic t-shirt at a time, we're going to focus on a successful launch, then take it from there. 
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE IN BLOOD
We would never ask you to put our designs on your body if we didn't whole heartedly believe in them.Designs will have a set goal. Once sales reach that number I will be getting that design tattooed on my body.It's not a gimmick, but instead, it is our ""quality assured in blood"" to you. This is a chance for you to participate in the direct reflection of our commitment to you, in a way that no other company allows people to participate. Want in? Then bear with me, keep on reading on . . . 
Quality Assured in Blood - The Tattoo Goal
In this crowd funding campaign, each contribution will be your active vote and participation in the process. Each shirt you purchase is your vote for the winning design. The first of many designs to be assured in blood.1. Choose your contribution tier based on the number of shirts you want to get
2. Then, I will follow up to get all of the details about . . .

specific designs
sizes
whether male or female style

. . . and keep the tally going as we count down to $2400.
The design with the most contributions will be the tattoo that I get. As well, any design that gets greater than 23* contributions will also become a tattoo on my body. 
*Why > 23 contributions? 
Because it allows me to produce shirts in the next tier of reduced costs from the company that I get the 100% organic shirts from, and from the local printer that we work with. Thus, those cost reductions will be reinvested in our commitments to you and the community.
Our goals and aims are bigger than this, but this is where we start. 
It would be an honor if what we stand for resonates with you.

 
Honesty: Where the money goes - each shirt
First off, there are fixed costs . . .
Blank shirts = $8.51/shirt
Printing cost/design (12-23 shirts same design) = $10/shirt
. . . From there I will follow up to discuss the specific plans of where the difference between the costs to me and the costs to you go. This clarity down to the exact fraction of a penny is crucial to me. I want you to know exactly what you've invested in because that's what you're doing, investing. You are investing in a company, in an idea, in a future populated by the type of businesses and people that you want to see.

The Designs: 
HOW TO GET INVOLVED: If what you've read and what you've seen speaks to you, if you're into what's going on here whether from a conscious stand point, or because it's just your style of fun, then ... choose the perk level you want based on how many designs you want (1-6). After you select the tier and pay, I'll message you directly and get the exact designs you want and the sizes you want.
FINALLY!!! DESIGNS!!! FEAST YOHHH EYES ON THESE MULL SUCKAHS!!!!
1. George Washington Wore A Weave - If one of the world's most revered leaders can achieve that position with a powdered wig fastened to his dome, then you can too! This homage to GW pokes fun at a now defunct style, but is meant to highlight that what you wear matters, but what matters more is how you rock it. So, shoulders back . . . tits out . . . do you, because realistically GW wore a weave (like, he actually did wear an actual weave y'all). 

 
2. Don't Tread on I - What you said, has been said before. So say it differently, SAY IT BETTER! Don't tread on me? Nah, sonion, DONT TREAD ON I. Revolutionary Rasta Snake (the rasta flag crown, Jamaican flag pattern on the snake, and rasta colored rattler) pays tribute to one people that say everyday phrases in a way that's just better. If I've said it once, I'll say it again, it's been said before. SAY IT BETTER.

 
3. I ❤️️ The Idea of NY - I ❤️️ NY? Sure, maybe. But, if you've lived here for any period of time you really get the feeling that the best part about New York is the idea of New York. It takes a special breed to love a city where finding a solid pile of human poop on your subway car is not as uncommon as you might expect, or what seems like a strategically placed gaggle of tourists looking directly up in the sky at seemingly nothing snapping their 150th picture while you're just trying to get to where you're going (at lightspeed walking pace), or hell, the family of rats that live in your apartment wall that your slum lord swears isn't his problem. In the end, all of this is ❤️️  worthy, but the idea of the city that never sleeps, that's what we're all here for.
 

 
4. Mustard on the Beet - is pretty objectively simple and potentially stupid, but it's what started this whole jam. Messing around with friends, stuck in the catchy trance that only DJ Mustard can deliver, I wanted to pay homage to ""Mustard on the beat,"" in the most figuratively literal way I could think of. 

 
5. Frank Ocean - Is in a similar vein to Young Mustard aka Dijon J, aka Family Size Poupon. I started playing around with other peoples' names and settled on ""hot dog on oceanic sunrise,"" aka Frank Ocean. 

 
6. Marl-Bro - Ever been to a grocery store and tried to read a label full of fake words with no regulation that is meant to make you ""feel"" healthier. Me too, well fu*k that. This shirt calls that reality out by applying words from the FDA that could actually legally be used to describe a pack of cigarettes due to the lack of legal regulation any of these words actually have . . .as always, Keep it 100's.

Perk Additions: The Packs
As you've read in the perks section, the perks come with these ""packs"" so I elaborated on what they are below. Thank You Daps Pack - This comes with every tier and will be stuffed with little personal touches from us to you saying danke, grazie, 谢谢, and good lookin out. Fitting Pack - Whether you're buying more clothes for you, for a friend, or whoever it is we're going to be sending some essentials for more precise future fitting and self-measuring. Again, these will come with some touches. What's that mean? You'll see. Cleaning Samples - Most companies want your stuff to be dunzo quick. This way you can buy more of their crap faster. Plus, a lot of the destruction to this world comes in the cleaning process, so we're going to send you a pack of some products that can help maintain your stuff, your health, and the world in the process.

Now it is time to push our brands out to the ultimate market to be able to concentrate on our dreams full time while also being able to employ and support other local artists! My fellow brands such as Torture Couture, Modifiedminds, El Vaquero Muerto and Pink Moon Prophecy will be coming with Missconstrued to help promote as a team.

When I first joined the<br/>foundation my only goal and focus was to develop into a great basketball player<br/>that would surpass my potential. Not only did I gain the knowledge and the<br/>skills to become a successful basketball player, Coach Shannon also instilled<br/>in us the importance of life and what opportunities lie ahead. Some of the<br/>lessons I learned playing under her was first, not everything was going to be<br/>handed to me on a silver platter. We had a lot of outside people looking in<br/>doubting our foundation and thinking we were up to no good. No one saw the timeand effort that it took.

That taught me that I wasn’t above the team, that even if I was the “best player” I still had to earn my spot, and not just by playing, but by being a good teammate and being “coachable”. To me, that was the biggest lesson I learned, to be coachable. That is the one lesson that is prevalent in everything I do: college ball, classes, clinical and work experience. If I hadn’t learned how to deal with constructive criticism, teamwork and hard work, than I would not have earned a full basketball scholarship, been voted captain of our team and graduated Cum Laude from SCC.

<a href=""http://retromountain.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Retro Mountain</a> is a modern take on the mad ski suits of the 80s and 90s. Many of the originals are chilly on the cold days, soggy on the wet days and fit like a brightly coloured bin bag (in the coolest possible way!) Retro Mountain has addressed all these issues to create a truly unique and striking yet technical and comfortable range of one piece skiwear.<br/>

<div>Our first season was amazing with lots of sales to all corners of the world. As we had to reinvest most of our revenue in to digital marketing and brand visibility, we now need a cash injection to order our next load of stock, increase our digital marketing and PR and focus on a few key events leading up to the next season. We have a lot of exciting collaborations being planned both for the UK and French Alps, all we need is the backing to bring those plans to fruition. Thats where YOU come in! <br/>
</div>
<div>Our skiwear range is expanding along with a super secret Jacuzzi range which is due to be launched later this year. We are really excited to get our unique products out to a hugely lucrative and exciting market of young, outgoing holiday addicts with a love for all things retro and stylish.</div>

Retro Mountain is a modern take on the mad ski suits of the 80s and 90s. Many of the originals are chilly on the cold days, soggy on the wet days and fit like a brightly coloured bin bag (in the coolest possible way!) Retro Mountain has addressed all these issues to create a truly unique and striking yet technical and comfortable range of one piece skiwear.













Graduated insulation to regulate your body temperature
YKK aqua-seal zips to keep the weather well and truly out
Thumb mitts to keep the snow out and your sleeves down
Inside and outside waterproof pockets
Fully waterproof but breathable fabric
Removable hoods and faux fur trim on the girls suits
As it is a one piece design, when you inevitably stack it showing off to your mates, you won't get any snow up your back or down your trousers! 














 

As exciting news goes we think a SHOP ON THE KINGS ROAD is pretty big! We are creating an Apres Ski bar in the heart of Chelsea on one of London's most prestigious roads with a number of fantastic partners to kick off the ski season in absolute style.  It's going to be big so make sure you are there. Lots of alpine cocktails, music and of course retro skiwear. We open our doors at 340 Kings Road on November 16th, its going to be Bold, Brave and offensively Retro!







 
Our first season was amazing with lots of sales to all corners of the world. As we had to reinvest most of our revenue in to digital marketing and brand visibility, we now need a cash injection to order our next load of stock, increase our digital marketing and PR and focus on a few key events leading up to the next season. We have a lot of exciting collaborations being planned both for the UK and French Alps, all we need is the backing to bring those plans to fruition. Thats where YOU come in! 

Our skiwear range is expanding along with a super secret Jacuzzi range which is due to be launched later this year. We are really excited to get our unique products out to a hugely lucrative and exciting market of young, outgoing holiday addicts with a love for all things retro and stylish.

Aren't onesies novelty items so won't they get wet and cold?
Well usually yes they are but not in this case. We realised that onesies are worn by loads of skiers not only because they are AWESOME but also because they're quite practical. They stop the breeze getting where it shouldn't and they keep the snow out. We've designed our skiwear to exceed current standards so you can ensure that you'll be toasty warm and dry all day.

How do i wash it?
Just bung it in the washing machine on a 30 degree wash, hang it up to dry (this can take a while because of the insulation and layers but it will dry) and it'll look as good as new. Girls make sure you take the hood and faux fur trims off just to stop the fur getting everywhere.

Do you ship worldwide?
We do indeed. We want to make Retro Mountain as accessible as possible to skiers whether they ski in France or New Zealand.

We hope you'll agree and take advantage of this incredible introductory price of $109, and help us bring this great boot to production.  Ridgemont was founded in 2014 to challenge the traditional look of outdoor footwear. Ridgemont is all about form and function. Ridgemont is great quality, good looking footwear that performs when you're walking the dog or conquering the trail—but also feels comfortable enough to wear at work or out for dinner. We combine the best materials and construction techniques but with a modern aesthetic. Our mission is to move the outdoor footwear market forward to the 21st century.We've always loved the style and durability of the original alpine hiking boots. What's better than a boot mostly made from of one big piece of beautiful full-grain leather? Talk about durable! It’s that simplicity and purposeful design that inspired us to create what we consider to be the perfect light hiking boot.You're probably thinking, ""If you like the old hikers so much, which are still around pretty much unchanged, why are you bothering to make your own?"" Good question. Here's why: While the originals are awesome in principle, we just find the proportions too clunky in practice. They make your feet look like boulders, and they're not much lighter, so we've slimmed the Heritage boot down for a thinner silhouette. We've made the upper from high quality full grain leather sourced from a gold rated ecologically responsible tannery, so it looks as good as it goes. We decided to put the Heritage boot on a half-cup outsole with an exposed EVA midsole to not only enhance comfort, but also to give the boot a more relaxed vibe around town. A set of self-colored laces is included with every pair.    We didn't design these boots for off-road duty only. We want to wear them to work, school, dinner and on the trail. We want sneaker level comfort with boot level durability. We want it all, and we know you do too. That's why we've built the Heritage on a super comfortable EVA midsole for all day, everyday comfort.We've also included our bespoke EVA Cush open cell foam insoles which, in addition to being super cushy yet supportive, are also anti-microbial, non-absorbant, and promote airflow.We know that comfort isn't all about cushioning when it comes to the trail, so we've used our custom Variflex lasting board to add rigidity where it's needed, without disrupting natural foot flexion.Finally and super importantly, we've also given the Heritage a fully waterproof lining from Hydroguard, because nothing ruins comfort like wet socks and feet.What good is a great looking boot if you're afraid to wear it while doing the stuff you love to do?

<div><b>How did we achieve such a low price?</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our motivation was to make 3D printing affordable and easy for everyone. We starting way back in 2013 by trying literally hundreds of component combinations. When we found the iteration that worked best in its simplest form, we redesigned and customized the motor while leaving only the essential structure needed for stable, quality 3D printing to make it affordable, simple and easy to use.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>101Hero’s cutting-edge technologies and specialized components give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. We have built more complex and more expensive 3D printers in the past and built upon that valuable experience to simplify design, optimize performance, and minimize costs.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hard work, perseverance and never compromising our goals paid off and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring 101Hero to you.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We rewarded our earliest supporters with 101Hero for only $49. Those limited rewards went fast but there is still incredible pricing available.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The retail price for 101Hero will be $99 but there is still time to save, for just $74 you can get a 101Hero with 2 rolls of printing plastic while that Pledge level lasts. See our rewards list below for more details.<br/>

How did we achieve such a low price?

Our motivation was to make 3D printing affordable and easy for everyone. We starting way back in 2013 by trying literally hundreds of component combinations. When we found the iteration that worked best in its simplest form, we redesigned and customized the motor while leaving only the essential structure needed for stable, quality 3D printing to make it affordable, simple and easy to use.


101Hero’s cutting-edge technologies and specialized components give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. We have built more complex and more expensive 3D printers in the past and built upon that valuable experience to simplify design, optimize performance, and minimize costs.


Hard work, perseverance and never compromising our goals paid off and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring 101Hero to you.


We rewarded our earliest supporters with 101Hero for only $49. Those limited rewards went fast but there is still incredible pricing available.


The retail price for 101Hero will be $99 but there is still time to save, for just $74 you can get a 101Hero with 2 rolls of printing plastic while that Pledge level lasts. See our rewards list below for more details.




101Hero 3D Printer Assembly Structure Rendering


Delivery and Set-up


In order to lower shipping costs and protect the 101Hero during shipping, your printer will arrive 90% pre-assembled. Set-up is simple and can be accomplished by anyone in minutes with just the turn of a few screws. Once final assembly is complete, simply insert the memory card, press the button and start creating!


In addition to rewards listed for your pledge level, the 101Hero will include a detailed instruction manual and a 100-240V A/C power adapter with a country-specific plug (EU, US, UK, AU).

A travel became more of a way to move around than a way to learn, experience, to have an adventure. Laurynas thought that hitchhiking is the best way to live a travel as an adventure but unfortunately it lacked a modern spice in it.

<h3>Sterling Sphere</h3>
<p>Glasses with side-shields are my passion.  I have one successful crowdfund under my belt and two years of production.  Over 5,000 pair of Sterling 23 and Eagle 48s have been delivered.  Those are the two lines I started after the last Indiegogo campaign.   It is now time to produce the Sphere.  The Spheres are a full .25 inches wider than the 23s with 50mm round lenses.</p>
<p>The Spheres measure in at 5.3 inches across from outside temple hinge. </p>

<p>I have already been through this process with over 1400 backers two years ago, and it is through them that I have been able to continue the business I have today.  I am excited to be launching another Indiegogo Campaign.  It is the vision of the backers that helped me achieve my goal before.  My original crowdfund campaign 2 years ago funded over 800% and set me on the path I am on now.  I faced a lot of pitfalls, and a lot of success in the previous campaign.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk is delay I found this out the hard way last time assuming my production run would be done 30 days after the end of the crowdfund campaign.  This campaign I have allowed for delays and have estimated a January Delivery.  That said if they come in sooner I will be able to ship as soon as I have them</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Sterling Sphere
Glasses with side-shields are my passion.  I have one successful crowdfund under my belt and two years of production.  Over 5,000 pair of Sterling 23 and Eagle 48s have been delivered.  Those are the two lines I started after the last Indiegogo campaign.   It is now time to produce the Sphere.  The Spheres are a full .25 inches wider than the 23s with 50mm round lenses.
The Spheres measure in at 5.3 inches across from outside temple hinge. 

Sphere Prototype
The Sphere has gone through rigorous testing to ensure that the final product is something I can be proud of.  The Rivets are strong and work beautifully with the Stainless Steel Wire Frames and the Mesh Stainless Side-Shields.

 
The Sterling Spheres are a bold statement of style and look great on both men and women. 



Colors
The Sphere will be offered in 6 colors using UV 400 Polarized Polycarbonate Lenses.
The Colors offered will be the classic Gray, Green and Amber

The reflective revo colors will be Blue, Black/Red and Silver

Prototypes are Done Now the Order
I have already invested in the molds and manufacture of the prototypes.  Now it is time to place the first order.  I have returned to the domain of crowdfunding as it is an efficient way to introduce my product to a mass audience of people with the same interest in these types of glasses and it affords me the opportunity to raise capital an pay for the initial order of the Sterling Spheres.

We donate $1 per order to the foundation of your choice. This month we are ""paying-it-forward"" to these 3 foundations:</p>

Our app can also integrate with Apple Health, so you can store all your health data in one place.</p><div data-id=""21087909""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509783/jwikwixhlsaxvs0nu1h8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""21192968""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""21235303""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""21193066""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509790/xrpds7tugjoeatz3b1fr.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""21429642""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530671316/idqbcterqbevsqjfacui.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""21248160""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.gizmodo.jp/2018/05/kickstarter-mim-x-smartwatch.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509791/zhvgo4uykuodiwgcbpuf.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p><a href=""https://www.gizmodo.jp/2018/05/kickstarter-mim-x-smartwatch.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">                                               </a></p><div data-id=""21262018""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://japan.cnet.com/article/35119257/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509792/tuy2vgnztzn8roucd3qz.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><div data-id=""21429803""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://thxpalm.blogspot.com/2018/05/mim-x.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509792/yv7vpgbmqmgsbbvfgx9e.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p>     </p><div data-id=""21192984""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509793/hthlcjkndfajoddeeff6.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""21020214""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1529509793/wkhqv532gqp1thsfstqk.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>mim X incorporates the patented* Transparent Levitation Display (TLD). </p><p>When switched on, information is shown on the glass without being obscured by the watch arms.

Users will be able to easily select the notifications they want to show on mim X. Taking advantage of the TLD technology, mim X can show two time zones independently.

You will be able to select either the display or the hands to commence auto time sync. Precisely monitor your cardiac frequency while exercising or at restDespite having the look of a traditional analog watch, mim X has all the features you can expect from a modern smartwatch.

Combining with the step counter and other sensors, mim X can do much more. From counting how much steps you take in a day, to notifying you for sitting too much.

It is considered as one of the most remarkable vistas on Earth. At certain times of the year, it transforms into a stunning canvas that perfectly reflects the clouds and the blue altiplano sky. Inspired by the fascinating characteristics of the lake, we came up with the idea of a smartwatch with a display that only appears when needed. mim X also has a minimalist stainless steel bezel that blends in with the unmarked watch face seamlessly, like the horizon disappears at Salar de Uyuni.Salar de Uyunimim X comes with two finishing, Steel and Stealth.

<h1> <strong>Our Story</strong> </h1>
<p><em>We created BeClothed because we wanted to create products that are comfortable, look great and are better for the environment.</em></p>
<p>We believe it is our mission to reinvent the relationship you have with your everyday wear. We do this by making clothing that is not only good for you but for the world too. Our clothes are designed to eliminate odour, thereby requiring you to wash them less often, leading to less wasted water, energy and wear on your clothes.</p>
<p>Born out the frustration that our clothes would never be the way we wanted, we set out to disrupt an outdated industry which is focused on planned obsolescence, the practice of intentionally and artificially limiting the useful life of a product for the purpose of driving more sales, something we're completely against.</p>
<p>We’re dedicated to crafting high-quality timeless products designed to last (and, hence, reduce waste). Our products are made from some of the best materials and are intentionally designed to last for years.</p>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Comfort, Hygiene and Versatility</strong></h1>
<p>The three pillars of everything we make are underscored by comfort, hygiene and versatility. We believe that every single thing you wear should be the best version that exists. </p>
<p>Our main focus above all is <strong>comfort</strong>, because who's going to wear something that doesn't feel great? We try our hardest to give your clothes that extra cosy feel. You can see everything we use in our garments below.</p>
<p><strong>Hygiene</strong> is the second of our pillars which is a huge part of our culture as many clothes get smelly very easily and need washing after every single wear which ultimately leads to degradation. Our garments don't smell for up to seven days, so you can pack light on that weekend away and come back wearing the clothes you went in (so you've got plenty of space for presents).</p>
<p>Last but by no means the least, <strong>versatility</strong>. We believe everything you buy should withstand everything you do, so whether you're at work, at the gym or even on a hike, all our clothing is made to withstand any environment so you won't need any athletic or smart versions of your clothes to take up more room in your wardrobe. </p>

<p>Grown from a soft, fluffy boll that's cultivated all over the world -  and even on the far side of the moon, - cotton is by far one of the oldest and most widespread materials around.</p>

<p>We were picked up by many outlets in the wake of our launch that by the end of it all we had shipped <strong>over 10,000+ pairs</strong> of our SilverSocks No-Show across all our platforms. This gave us the green light that we were doing something that was in very high demand and we knew we couldn't stop there.</p>
<p>With our first product hitting shelves and our team working tirelessly to keep up with orders on our site, we were being <strong>asked by thousands of customers</strong> if we'd be able to make our socks in a longer crew version that they were more used to. </p>
<p>Even with the demand, we had to spend countless months perfecting every single aspect so as to ensure we'd release only the best version before launch day.

 Our Story 
We created BeClothed because we wanted to create products that are comfortable, look great and are better for the environment.
We believe it is our mission to reinvent the relationship you have with your everyday wear. We do this by making clothing that is not only good for you but for the world too. Our clothes are designed to eliminate odour, thereby requiring you to wash them less often, leading to less wasted water, energy and wear on your clothes.
Born out the frustration that our clothes would never be the way we wanted, we set out to disrupt an outdated industry which is focused on planned obsolescence, the practice of intentionally and artificially limiting the useful life of a product for the purpose of driving more sales, something we're completely against.
We’re dedicated to crafting high-quality timeless products designed to last (and, hence, reduce waste). Our products are made from some of the best materials and are intentionally designed to last for years.
Comments on the SilverSocks
Some people who've written about us


   


 
How it works
The Cotton is intertwined with threads of our patented Silver fibers that weave in and out to ensure full coverage.
When any part of the Silver touches a bacterial cell, it breaks down its cell wall until the bacteria is no longer able to function, effectively rendering it inactive and unable to produce the pungent smell that comes when it feeds on your sweat.
Method of Application
Our patented Silver fibers are made from a specialist design allowing them to be woven directly into the fabric. During manufacture, the Cotton fibers are intertwined with our patented Silver fibers to ensure each and every surface is covered. 

Comfort, Hygiene and Versatility
The three pillars of everything we make are underscored by comfort, hygiene and versatility. We believe that every single thing you wear should be the best version that exists. 
Our main focus above all is comfort, because who's going to wear something that doesn't feel great? We try our hardest to give your clothes that extra cosy feel. You can see everything we use in our garments below.
Hygiene is the second of our pillars which is a huge part of our culture as many clothes get smelly very easily and need washing after every single wear which ultimately leads to degradation. Our garments don't smell for up to seven days, so you can pack light on that weekend away and come back wearing the clothes you went in (so you've got plenty of space for presents).
Last but by no means the least, versatility. We believe everything you buy should withstand everything you do, so whether you're at work, at the gym or even on a hike, all our clothing is made to withstand any environment so you won't need any athletic or smart versions of your clothes to take up more room in your wardrobe. 

 Origins of Cotton
Grown from a soft, fluffy boll that's cultivated all over the world -  and even on the far side of the moon, - cotton is by far one of the oldest and most widespread materials around.
Usually planted in the spring, it is a perennial that lives on year after year and keeps growing. With evidence of use in the old world before 5000 BC, it sits firmly near the top of the most resilient fabrics around.
What Does It Do?
Cotton is super lightweight and durable and as a result, is one of the best base materials there is. The soft-to-the-touch quality ensures comfort and cosiness with every wear.
With its roots in the neolithic period, cotton is a reliable, weather-proof insulator that's perfect at any moment and for every occasion.
The comfortable yet flexible stretch makes cotton the perfect fabric to use in all garments, along with its hypoallergenic properties that make it a flawless favourite.
With the prominently high tensile strength of the twill weave, it's able to withstand multiple washes without a problem.
Sustainable Farming
We only source our cotton from organic crops which haven't been adulterated by genetic modification. This gives an experience as similar to the original cotton that we strive to implement. By cutting out the use of pesticides and other chemicals, we can ensure all our garments are held to a higher standard and free from allergens.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are two sisters that love when the clothing we own can serve multiple functions. It never made sense to us to wear ugly sneakers on the walk to work, then carry fancy but uncomfortable high heels to wear at the office. We feel burdened by the need to wear workout clothes to bike from place to place, and carry a change of clothes to look presentable when we arrive at our destinations. <strong>Why can’t one item do it all? </strong></p>
<p>We desire <strong>clothing that will suit our active lifestyles, but also encompass the stylish way we present ourselves every day</strong>. With Amber coming from New York City and Beth from Denver, Colorado, we both desire attire that can transition easily between any kind of activity - from office hours to happy hour, from cycling on a bike to spinning on the dance floor. </p>
<p><u>We are creating The Bike Dress in order to: </u><br/><strong>Support</strong> a way to live more simply with a dress that can be used for any type of activity. <br/><strong>Create</strong> clothing in which any person can feel comfortable and confident.<br/><strong>Empower</strong> people to be more active throughout every facet of their lives, not just when wearing athletic gear.<br/><strong>Reduce</strong> the need for carrying a bag or purse, but still have the ability to carry the necessities in pockets. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have completed our first round of prototypes, and need funding in order to complete the second round to be sure we’re creating exactly what we want to present to the world. We are creating three versions of The Bike Dress to suit different body types, as well as two types of fitted shorts to be worn underneath. </p>
<p>The funding will go towards paying for <strong>new prototypes, fabrics, and marketing</strong>. It will be the foundation we need to get our company off the ground so that we can begin to sell The Bike Dress online.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although The Bike Dress began with the desire to merge fashion with function, it also stems from the desire to give power back to whoever wears it. </p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Jeans that come with fake pockets, or pockets sewn shut. Dresses without any pockets at all. <br/><strong>Our Solution:</strong> Big deep pockets that zip shut to carry all belongings with ease. An additional hidden pocket for added safety and convenience. </p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Fashionable dresses that are restricting, made out of delicate, uncomfortable materials. <br/><strong>Our Solution:</strong> Fashionable dresses made out of breathable, wicking fabric, forgiving materials that are easy to wash and wear over and over again, and flexible components that allow for movement. </p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Lack of confidence with dresses that ride or fly up. <br/><strong>Our Solution:</strong> A weighted hem that stays in place. “Safety” shorts that come with each dress to wear underneath.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We want to keep The Bike Dress affordable and accessible to all, but also keep the materials sustainable and coming from responsible sources. </p>
<p>Beth has over 15 years of experience in marketing, advertising, and design, and will take the lead on these aspects. Amber has 12 years of experience in project management, research, and planning. We are determined, hardworking, and passionate, all which will fuel the success of this endeavor.</p>

Together they make the ready-to-wear fashion brand Staci Sherri.</p><p>The brand's designs integrate feminine prowess with sleek, contemporary styles for fearless women who're unwilling to compromise on quality. The designs celebrate the feminine form with sexy silhouettes and delicate accents.</p><p>Staci Sherri, the brand's founder and creative director, creates collections inspired by the unforgettable moments of daily life and love (the universal connector). This imaginative and forward-thinking designer is best known for her uncanny ability to identify trends before they reach mass appeal. Her designs incorporate vivid expression, intricate details, lines tailored to accentuate natural beauty and remarkable functionality.</p><div>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/382/251/8b7fda2808615900b3364953eeac97ca_large.jpg?1407120470"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>While Staci Sherri has caught the attention of stylists, celebrities and industry tastemakers, the brand has outgrown its humble beginnings and seeks to expand its production to meet the growing demand. We need your help to undergo the next phase in Staci Sherri’s growth.</p>
<p>Staci Sherri has a three-fold mission: (1) to build a national brand of high-quality apparel for the fashionably conscious contemporary consumer that accentuates natural beauty and stirs innate curiosity; (2) to support economic resurgence and sustainable manufacturing in the United States by solely partnering with domestic companies; and (3) to represent and infuse messages that empower, inspire and encourage our consumers to advance themselves in a positive direction.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/381/975/4eb6d32d73d0d947dfadc1248fb4bc0c_large.jpg?1407116839"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>The Staci Sherri consumer is ambitious, fearless and on a journey of self-discovery. Our target market is contemporary women, ages 18 to 40, with an urban chic sensibility. With women accounting for 85% of all consumer purchases in the U.S., your pledges will help us reach one the nation's largest markets.</p>
<p>We're hoping to raise as much money as possible. Any money we raise beyond our target goal will go towards completing additional collections, as well as help with overhead costs, compensating the great team of people working on this project and the continuation of a developing brand.</p>
<h1>Our Goal</h1>
<p><b>$10,000</b> is our target goal and will be enough to start and produce small minimums in production, create a collection look book and line sheet, and produce production samples for showrooms and sales representatives. If we raise more than $10,000, we'll be able to produce additional seasons, show in New York Fashion Week, market the brand and advertise at trade shows.</p>
<p>It's your turn to stand out in Staci Sherri, and help us get our message out.</p>

<h1>Our Stretch Goals</h1>
<p><b>$20,000</b> - Will support Staci Sherri's debut for Spring/Summer 2015 collection in New York Fashion Week. The funds will also help produce the brand’s Spring/Summer 2015 NYFW runway show, look book, line sheets, and production samples for showrooms and sales representatives.</p>
<p><b>$30,000</b> - Will help relaunch Staci Sherri’s website and showroom to reflect the current state of the brand. Fifty of the top elite fashion insiders and celebrities will be invited to the showroom launch, along with buyers, investors and press. Event attendees will get the opportunity to enjoy drinks and food, while viewing Staci Sherri’s latest collection. Media outlets will be on-site to interview Staci and broadcast from the grand opening of the showroom.</p>
<p><b>$40,000</b> - Will help us exhibit in various trade and market shows in 2015. This will be great exposure for the brand and will put our message in front of millions of consumers. Buyers from all over will be able to buy the latest collection, and event exposure will take the brand to greater heights.</p>
<p><b>$50,000</b> - With everyone's help we can continue the growth of Staci Sherri. If we raise more than our goal, we'll be able to produce an additional collection for Fall/Winter 2016, including a runway show in New York Fashion Week, look book, line sheet, production samples for showrooms and sales representatives, marketing and branding campaigns, and department store placement.</p>

</div><br/></div>","Who is Staci Sherri? ""Staci"" is young, fun and flirty, and ""Sherri"" is grown, sexy and sophisticated. Together they make the ready-to-wear fashion brand Staci Sherri.The brand's designs integrate feminine prowess with sleek, contemporary styles for fearless women who're unwilling to compromise on quality. The designs celebrate the feminine form with sexy silhouettes and delicate accents.Staci Sherri, the brand's founder and creative director, creates collections inspired by the unforgettable moments of daily life and love (the universal connector). This imaginative and forward-thinking designer is best known for her uncanny ability to identify trends before they reach mass appeal. Her designs incorporate vivid expression, intricate details, lines tailored to accentuate natural beauty and remarkable functionality.

While Staci Sherri has caught the attention of stylists, celebrities and industry tastemakers, the brand has outgrown its humble beginnings and seeks to expand its production to meet the growing demand. We need your help to undergo the next phase in Staci Sherri’s growth.
Staci Sherri has a three-fold mission: (1) to build a national brand of high-quality apparel for the fashionably conscious contemporary consumer that accentuates natural beauty and stirs innate curiosity; (2) to support economic resurgence and sustainable manufacturing in the United States by solely partnering with domestic companies; and (3) to represent and infuse messages that empower, inspire and encourage our consumers to advance themselves in a positive direction.


The Staci Sherri consumer is ambitious, fearless and on a journey of self-discovery. Our target market is contemporary women, ages 18 to 40, with an urban chic sensibility. With women accounting for 85% of all consumer purchases in the U.S., your pledges will help us reach one the nation's largest markets.
We're hoping to raise as much money as possible. Any money we raise beyond our target goal will go towards completing additional collections, as well as help with overhead costs, compensating the great team of people working on this project and the continuation of a developing brand.
Our Goal
$10,000 is our target goal and will be enough to start and produce small minimums in production, create a collection look book and line sheet, and produce production samples for showrooms and sales representatives. If we raise more than $10,000, we'll be able to produce additional seasons, show in New York Fashion Week, market the brand and advertise at trade shows.
It's your turn to stand out in Staci Sherri, and help us get our message out.


Our Stretch Goals
$20,000 - Will support Staci Sherri's debut for Spring/Summer 2015 collection in New York Fashion Week. The funds will also help produce the brand’s Spring/Summer 2015 NYFW runway show, look book, line sheets, and production samples for showrooms and sales representatives.
$30,000 - Will help relaunch Staci Sherri’s website and showroom to reflect the current state of the brand. Fifty of the top elite fashion insiders and celebrities will be invited to the showroom launch, along with buyers, investors and press. Event attendees will get the opportunity to enjoy drinks and food, while viewing Staci Sherri’s latest collection. Media outlets will be on-site to interview Staci and broadcast from the grand opening of the showroom.
$40,000 - Will help us exhibit in various trade and market shows in 2015. This will be great exposure for the brand and will put our message in front of millions of consumers. Buyers from all over will be able to buy the latest collection, and event exposure will take the brand to greater heights.
$50,000 - With everyone's help we can continue the growth of Staci Sherri. If we raise more than our goal, we'll be able to produce an additional collection for Fall/Winter 2016, including a runway show in New York Fashion Week, look book, line sheet, production samples for showrooms and sales representatives, marketing and branding campaigns, and department store placement.

How many times in your life have you been gaining or losing weight and needed a hole in your belt where there wasn't one? Not to mention, perhaps you have thicker clothing and/or more layers making your normal belt hole too tight. This belt is the solution! I purchased two different colors and got the hanger which is excellent and very convenient. Another great feature of these belts is since you do not have to push the post into a belt hole while you pull the belt backwards day after day, you will not have that worn out crease that looks hideous if you use a different belt hole. - W.

 The new Kore Tek Belt features Grade 1 Titanium Buckles, Full-Grain Leather Belts with Flex-Core™ center and our micro track with more adjustment ability (40+ size positions) than any other ratchet belt.                                                                                                           Welcome to our 4th IndieGoGo Project !  In 2013, we introduced our first Kore track belts (then Trakline Belts) and set a crowdfunding record for fashion accessories. Since then we’ve sold over 100,000 belts worldwide.But our goal isn’t to sell the most belts – it’s to sell the best.  Introducing the  >> WORLD’S FIRST  TITANIUM  TRACK  BELT.  THIS PROJECT HAS ENDED GET A BELT ON OUR WEBSITE  >>  KORE ESSENTIALS   Why’s all this such a big deal? Because throughout the day as you work, walk, eat, sleep and play, your waist size fluctuates - in a little – or out a little in small increments. That’s why traditional belts with 5 holes don’t work. The holes are spaced too far apart. They never seem to match your waist.  THIS PROJECT HAS ENDED GET A BELT ON OUR WEBSITE  >>  KORE ESSENTIALS   But Kore belts are different. Our track system, sewn into the back of the belt, has 40+ micro size positions to adjust with - each just ¼” apart. It actually locks to your exact waist size every time you slide it on. It’s the best-fitting, most comfortable belt you will ever wear.   For the first time ever, we’re introducing 4 solid, grade 1 titanium ratchet buckles. Each buckle features a 2 millimeter thick body, with alloy undercarriage (1.5 to 2 oz. total weight). Titanium is one of the strongest, lightest metals known to man, and used to make rocket ships and supersonic jets.  These buckles do a lot more than just look good.  The Leather is Full-Grain (1-3/8 inches or 35mm wide) and chrome tanned to resist the fading and scratching you get from vegetable tanning.  Full-Grain is the highest grade of leather and actually improves with age.  Next we added a proprietary Flex-Core center for added durability and strength.  This strong, fibrous core ads strength and extends the belt life. Backers can choose between classic or pebble-grain in black or brown.  Next we added a proprietary Flex-Core center for added durability and strength.  This strong, fibrous core ads strength and extends the belt life. Backers can choose between classic or pebble-grain in black or brown. Each belt comes extra long and in One-Size that FITS ANY waist size from 24” to 44”. You trim it to your size in minutes with household scissors. Simply locate your pant size on the back of the belt using the Printed Ruler Marks (no measuring needed).  Add 4 inches and cut. Then clamp the belt into the buckle and wear. If the belt is too long, remove the buckle and cut off another inch. It's that easy. Here's your buckle and belt choices.  THIS PROJECT HAS ENDED GET A BELT ON OUR WEBSITE  >>  KORE ESSENTIALS   Now you don’t have to choose between comfort and style – you get them both. Kore Titanium Buckles and Belts are INTERCHANGEABLE with all our Kore standard fashion belts and buckles so you can mix and match. Click to Visit >> KoreEssentials <<To expedite the process, we have already begun manufacturing the items so that Backers can get their rewards sooner. We are planning to get them out 30-60 days after the project ends.  We will offer expedited worldwide service for faster delivery.  At Kore, all of our products have a 30 Money Back Guarantee if you are not happy with your purchase and 1 Year Warranty against unusual wear or any defects.                                                                 Thanks for your support ! THIS PROJECT HAS ENDED GET A BELT ON OUR WEBSITE  >>  KORE ESSENTIALS  See what a few CUSTOMERS had to say about our belts....   Here I am, a half a year later, still using the belts every day and they're still rocking.

Thanks to him for letting us use some pictures (from his book) of soldiers proudly sporting their Wristlet watches.</p><h1>Challenge/Opportunity</h1><p>Pocket watches are usually in the range of 50mm+ and as you can imagine housing a pocket watch of 50mm+ you would need a big leather cup. Along with the cup and outside seam on the leather would make the leather case diameter in the range of 55mm-60mm, which is pretty big for a wrist watch. On top of that, pocket watch ""Bow"" would always be protruding out of the strap.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>In order to make a more manageable design we started by creating 2 custom watch cases, 37mm and 32mm. We built our wristlet prototypes around these cases. 37mm case makes the wristlet of around 45mm and 32mm case makes wristlet of 37mm diameter. In order to produce these cases we worked with a reliable and reputable watch case and dial manufacturer, who we’ll using for production as well.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/394853/files/20140225171443-Dials_New.png?1393377283"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>For the straps itself, we are collaborating with a very well known company which is known for quality leather products since 1880. Leather straps for wristlets are all handmade and it’s a very labor intensive process to make them. Leather used in these wristlets is very high quality English calf leather. There were few challenges we had to overcome</p><ul>
<li>Stiffening of the leather so that the cup retains its shape. This process takes more than 3 days for each strap.</li>
<li>Stitching around the cup where it attaches to the wrist strap. You can notice, this stitching is very close to the cup and needs a sewing with an exceptionally narrow foot.</li>

<h1>Where we are now &amp; Where are we heading?</h1>
<p>We have had a successful run on KickStarter and we are already in the process of producing our first production run. We’ve been working with manufacturers and finalizing the details. The pictures you are prototypes that have been developed in last one year. We’ve created a product we’re really excited to share with you and we hope you’ll love.</p>
<h1>Production Plan</h1>
<p>We are working with manufacturers for strap and watch inserts for our initial production run for delivery of May 2014 and second batch in June 2014.</p>
<p>Watch Straps will be manufactured in India by a manufacturer who's been manufacturing leather goods since 1880. They have helped us with our prototypes and have capacity to handle from small quantities to a large volume of order.</p>
<p>Watch Inserts will be manufactured in China by a very reputable and reliable manufacturer who manufactures watches for some very famous watch brands. We have verified the quality and their capacity to handle large volume of orders. Also, we have ensured they'll be committed to a timely delivery of our orders.</p>
<p>As far distribution is concerned we have partnered with multiple carriers who can deliver our products anywhere in the world. We'll be choosing appropriate carrier depending on the destination of delivery.</p>
<p>The next step is to get these watches on to your wrist. It's very exciting to see when your vision of a product becomes a reality. But this is where you, the backers come in to save the day.</p>

On top of that, pocket watch ""Bow"" would always be protruding out of the strap.SolutionIn order to make a more manageable design we started by creating 2 custom watch cases, 37mm and 32mm. We built our wristlet prototypes around these cases. 37mm case makes the wristlet of around 45mm and 32mm case makes wristlet of 37mm diameter. In order to produce these cases we worked with a reliable and reputable watch case and dial manufacturer, who we’ll using for production as well.For the straps itself, we are collaborating with a very well known company which is known for quality leather products since 1880. Leather straps for wristlets are all handmade and it’s a very labor intensive process to make them. Leather used in these wristlets is very high quality English calf leather. There were few challenges we had to overcome
Stiffening of the leather so that the cup retains its shape. This process takes more than 3 days for each strap.
Stitching around the cup where it attaches to the wrist strap. You can notice, this stitching is very close to the cup and needs a sewing with an exceptionally narrow foot.
DesignOur case design allows not only to wear these watches in the Wristlet strap but also use them in more conventional wrist straps of 20mm and 16mm. If we were to build these in small quantities, cost would be very high. In order to make this a viable product and bring down the cost of manufacturing we need to meet our manufacturer's minimum order quantity and that’s the reason we are here.

Where we are now & Where are we heading?
We have had a successful run on KickStarter and we are already in the process of producing our first production run. We’ve been working with manufacturers and finalizing the details. The pictures you are prototypes that have been developed in last one year. We’ve created a product we’re really excited to share with you and we hope you’ll love.
Production Plan
We are working with manufacturers for strap and watch inserts for our initial production run for delivery of May 2014 and second batch in June 2014.
Watch Straps will be manufactured in India by a manufacturer who's been manufacturing leather goods since 1880. They have helped us with our prototypes and have capacity to handle from small quantities to a large volume of order.
Watch Inserts will be manufactured in China by a very reputable and reliable manufacturer who manufactures watches for some very famous watch brands. We have verified the quality and their capacity to handle large volume of orders. Also, we have ensured they'll be committed to a timely delivery of our orders.
As far distribution is concerned we have partnered with multiple carriers who can deliver our products anywhere in the world. We'll be choosing appropriate carrier depending on the destination of delivery.
The next step is to get these watches on to your wrist. It's very exciting to see when your vision of a product becomes a reality. But this is where you, the backers come in to save the day.

<p><b>But... here goes:</b></p>
<p>I have a lot to offer the world.  I'm an artist, musician, blogger and storyteller - but - more than that... I have:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Completely</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> transformed my life, my body, my career, my lifestyle and the way I educate my kids... (and I want to share that journey with others and offer encouragement, advice and inspiration)...</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And I have a fairly successful <a href=""www.liveagainsttheflow.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>... with a couple-thousand visitors per month...</span></li>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And I have hosted creative self-esteem &amp; self-discovery workshops for women and girls (<a href=""https://heathercostaras.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/cell-c-girl-achiever-bootcamp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like this one</a>)... </span></li>

(including what it feels like to burn-out from trying to help <i>everyone else</i> at the expense of one's own dreams)...</li>
<li>And I've travelled extensively,  been nominated as a Tearfund <a href=""http://inspiredindividuals.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Inspired Individual""</a>,  won a Diamond-in-the-Rough award and was invited to Nashville by a producer to record a demo (which I did), spoken (and sung) at various events around the world,  been interviewed on various radio &amp; TV shows (both in South Africa and abroad), was chosen as one of 10 social entrepreneurs from around the world to speak at the City Hall during Design Indaba... (the list of stuff and stories could go on)...</li>
</ul>
<div>And yet...<i> in spite </i>of all these incredible experiences and opportunities... and all of my abilities...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>I have $3.50 in my paypal account.  And about $6.50 in my personal bank account.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><i>Why?</i></div>
<div>Because - although I am VERY GOOD at what I do... (all the <b>creative</b> stuff, that is)...</div>
<div>I <i>utterly suck </i>at marketing myself.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And I suck at strategising... sales... business-planning... and neatly project-managing all of my zillions of creative ideas in a coherent way which *could* earn me a decent income... (but doesn't.  And hasn't.  For a long, long time).</div>

<p>(Heather Costaras)</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary Okay... so... (*phew*)... this is hard for me.  I'm trying to channel Amanda Palmer and just *ASK*... but asking is excruciatingly hard for me... 
But... here goes:
I have a lot to offer the world.  I'm an artist, musician, blogger and storyteller - but - more than that... I have:



Completely transformed my life, my body, my career, my lifestyle and the way I educate my kids... (and I want to share that journey with others and offer encouragement, advice and inspiration)...

And I have a fairly successful blog... with a couple-thousand visitors per month...
And I have written an illustrated book titled ""How Heather got her HAT'ness back"" (soon to be self-published and shared with the world)...
And I have hosted creative self-esteem & self-discovery workshops for women and girls (like this one)... 
And I host concerts and story-telling evenings... and I write music and sing songs...

And I've launched this humanitarian project (with support from people like Vivienne Westwood)... and this youth development project (with corporate sponsorship)... and this NGO... (and hooooo-boy.... the LESSONS I have learned and the STORIES I could tell you about *those* experiences!!!)... (including what it feels like to burn-out from trying to help everyone else at the expense of one's own dreams)...
And I've travelled extensively,  been nominated as a Tearfund ""Inspired Individual"",  won a Diamond-in-the-Rough award and was invited to Nashville by a producer to record a demo (which I did), spoken (and sung) at various events around the world,  been interviewed on various radio & TV shows (both in South Africa and abroad), was chosen as one of 10 social entrepreneurs from around the world to speak at the City Hall during Design Indaba... (the list of stuff and stories could go on)...

And yet... in spite of all these incredible experiences and opportunities... and all of my abilities...

I have $3.50 in my paypal account.  And about $6.50 in my personal bank account.

Why?
Because - although I am VERY GOOD at what I do... (all the creative stuff, that is)...
I utterly suck at marketing myself.  

And I suck at strategising... sales... business-planning... and neatly project-managing all of my zillions of creative ideas in a coherent way which *could* earn me a decent income... (but doesn't.  And hasn't.  For a long, long time).
It's embarrassing.  And - I'm embarrassed to even share this story with you.

Thankfully - I have a very supportive husband (who is currently the sole breadwinner)... and we are careful with our spending and we have drastically reduced our debt... but I am frustrated with myself because I *know* I can contribute something of value to the world AND earn myself an income at the same time... and I know I *could* contribute financially to our family (and ease the load on Nick)... but it's like all the little itty-bitty pieces and zillions of ideas are floating all over the place and I really struggle to bring it all together... in strategic, coherent manner.
   What I Need & What You Get Enter Marie Forleo's B-School.
What's B-school?
Well, in Marie's words:  'B-School is an 8 week online training program that shows you step-by-step how to build a unique and profitable brand, market more effectively, and turn your online presence into a world-changing machine"".
Eeeeee!!!
I need B-school!  In fact - I wanted to sign up for B-school last year (but didn't have the money and was too embarrassed to ask anyone for help).
I desperately need those step-by-step strategies (because my brain just doesn't think like that!)... My brain doesn't do ""step-by-step""... my brain doesn't do ""strategic plan-of-action""... my brain thinks in bright colours and stories and images and endless streams of creative ideas!
I really-really-really think that B-school can help me cohesively organise my business (and I'm especially convinced after I read through the curriculum offered... and then read about all the B-school grads - many of whom are creative creatures like me!  :-) )
And even better news... after writing a blog post on how I needed help and was searching for my ""Andrew"" (a business partner - polar-opposite in strengths to me)... I now have wonderful-Tracy (helping me on a part-time basis).
Tracy is opposite to me (strengths wise).  She's brilliant with admin, budgeting, counting, organising and implementing - and she's great at holding me accountable... but even Tracy can't read my crazy-creative brain!  
Tracy still needs a cohesive, strategic business plan to work from.  And B-School can help us put it all together!
B-school... however... costs money:
$2000 - or rather, $1999 to be precise.  What's more - registration closes on the 4th of March... and B-school only happens once a year (so I've sorta got a little fire lit under my bum at the moment)...
If you DO decide to support me on this quest... and send me through B-school... I'll post you all kinds of happy-Hat art-offerings (just check out the ""perks"" on the right)...
The Impact
 I just know that B-school is going to help me gain CLARITY and a cohesive, step-by-step plan of action.   I know that it will help me to better answer the following questions: 

Who is my target market?

Who am I trying to help and serve?
How do I keep people interested in my books and projects without drowning them in boring promotional material?
Should Living Differently be somehow combined with Beautiful Life Project?
How do I effectively combine all my pet-projects with the least possible confusion (to the people who follow those different projects).?
How do I market my creative workshops?
What should come first:  ""SHINE! Camp for Girls"" or the creative workshops designed to help folk of all ages to discover and embrace their uniqueness...?
Which of my courses will be MOST helpful to my audience?
Which of my courses are irrelevant and should be ditched?
Should I offer online courses - and if so, how much content should I include?
How much should I charge for those online courses?
How do I make a decent living (for Tracy and myself)... whilst still offering lots of free, fun material for my wonderful online tribe?
How do I sell myself (and my products)... without making my tribe feel used and abused?
How do I answer the dreaded dinner-party question:  ""So... what do YOU do?""

(And many, many other questions that I really struggle to answer in a cohesive manner).


And if we don't raise enough money... (or raise MORE than the $2000 goal)...?If we don't raise the full $2000... I will use whatever we *have* raised to get myself into B-school (Marie offers a 4-month payment plan of $549)... and I'll have to think of some creative ways to come up with the balance.
If we raise *more* than the $2000... the rest of the money will be invested in to the following:



Printing lots of copies of ""How Heather got her HAT'ness back""...

Promo material, food and musicians for the launch (of above-mentioned book) which will include an evening of Songs & Stories... :-)
Anything else will go towards producing the course material... the short film... and all kinds of other big-dreams and stuff...

(Basically saying... I'm not gonna blow the money on shoes.  Or Nutella). 



So... there you have it.


  As I mentioned, this is hard.  Asking is really hard for me.  Deep down inside of me (and I'm pretty sure that every artist struggles with this on some level)... there's an angry little voice screaming:
""Stop begging, you loser!""  and  ""Get a REAL job!""
I suspect there's still some dodgy remnants from all those years ago when I first ""lost"" Hat (for those of you who have no cooking clue of what I'm talking about when I talk about ""Hat"" - just click here).
Anyhoo... I remember something Amanda Palmer said (after she had raised all that money on Kickstarter) and the press were saying:  ""Amanda - how did you make all those people support your campaign?"" - and she said:  
""I didn't make them.  I asked them"".
So... this is me... *asking*... :  Can you help enrol me in B-school?  Can you help me print some Hatbooks?  Can you help?   Other Ways You Can Help If you don't have any funds to spare... I'd still appreciate your support spreading the word - or simply connecting with me.   Any words of advice or encouragement are always enormously appreciated (I'm a words-of-affirmation love-language person).
A million thank-you's!!!!

It's a sign of wealth and as the price of gold and silver rises and the barrier to purchase increases, it's never been more important to pass on those precious metals as heirlooms and I truly believe my product will allow you to do just.

This exemplifies exactly the look and character of our next collection. Clean lines, neat styling, pure concept, correct timekeeping. The appeal of the watch is in the simplicity, it’s all about removing the trees and seeing the wood, suspending the gadgets and revealing the clarity and effortless style of an immaculate timepiece. No clutter, no confusion. For men and women, for all occasions and lifestyle. Wear every day and any day made possible by the choice of 40mm for the larger wrist or 36mm for the smaller wrist, with stainless steel silver or gold cases and a choice of eight straps (for now - more to come) in soft supple leather or NATO. A great selection to match your own mood and individuality.   WHYTES PRIMARY GOALS1. Quality – Our primary goal for all watches we manufacture. Quality is the mainstay of our philosophy which means not only the watch but also the packaging, shipping and customer service.2. Price – We painstakingly source the best component parts, but that does not mean a high price tag. Our profit margin is low to provide direct sales to you on Kickstarter whilst allowing us sufficient funds to develop the next watch. It is a formula that works and which we will stick to. Exorbitant prices are not necessary to be able to produce an excellent watch. We have proved that. 3. Design – We want the watch to look beautiful. Take a look at our pictures; we think they look stunning. Minimal fuss, maximum impact. Fine craftsmanship need not be loud, quiet, refined and understated speaks for itself. 4. Manufacture – Our ultimate goal is to bring as much of the manufacturing process as possible into Canada. We want our future production to be fully completed in beautiful British Columbia, bringing more work to the region and ensuring our other goals are achieved.  Premium components come as standard with the TERSUSA slim polished 316LStainless Steel case with built in strength and integrity lies flat to the wrist, surgical instrument quality, unobtrusive and beautiful.SWISS Ronda quartz movement, extremely reliable and highly praised for its accuracy and precision and made by one of the most reputable movement manufacturers in the world.Sapphire crystal glass which only a diamond can scratch.

<p>A.
The art industry is a $60 billion-dollar industry. Right now, online art sales
account for $5 billion of the total global revenue with a prediction of 20%
annual growth. The art buyer demographics is also becoming younger. The same
holds true for the home furnishing industry. Out of the $41 billion global
sales, $9 billion are through online purchases. Both industries are
shifting to the online market and we are at the cusp of it. </p><p>

<p>I'm an artist, activist &amp;
businesswoman, whose life revolves around passion. I immerse myself in projects
I am passionate about. Starting out as a jeweler, I focused on how to
contribute to society by helping and empowering women. I moved to designing
home furniture, wanting to bring color, originality, and energy to as many
homes as possible. Now I am an online gallery owner who brings the art
community closer to the business world, all while helping artists to get more
exposure.</p>

skills and passion for the arts successfully bridging her clients, artists and

<p><i>While visiting Venice, CA last summer I
fell in love with a particularly large and delicate piece of wall mounted
sculpture. No kidding, this piece was at least 3'x4' and I needed it for my NYC
office for a re-model I was wrapping up in just a few days. Instead of taking
chances with a commercial shipper, Dary actually arranged for a courier to
deliver it personally from point A to B... It arrived in  perfect condition

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We're a team of fashion, beauty and style enthusiasts with experience in business development, marketing, sales, healthcare and social media; co-located in New York and Houston. We develop a monthly Style Box available via subscription, to help women stay in style during their pregnancy. Preggonista is also creating an online community where preggonistas can encourage each other, share information and enjoy special perks. Due to launch on Labor Day, we need your help to bring this into the world.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our campaign goals are twofold: One, raise $20,000 toward hard costs associated with this long-term venture, specifically to further build our inventory. And two, to establish relationships with businesses and brands who want to work with us to empower pregnant women. Whether you are a business or individual (you don't have to be pregnant!), you’ll enjoy the perks for your contributions. We’d appreciate your support toward making this a reality and hope that we’ll get to meet you either through one of our launch events or on PreggonistaTV!</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In July 2012, Tamisha Piper, co-founder, admitted during a hushed phone call with co-founder, Tina Hawkins, that her pants were unbuttoned – while she was at work. Tamisha was nearing her sixth month of pregnancy and still hadn’t bought maternity clothes. Tina, not believing Tamisha’s claim that it was difficult to find maternity clothes, spent the weekend shopping and quickly discovered that, unless one finds muumuus appealing, it was difficult to find stylish maternity wear. The pair finally found six fashion essentials that Tamisha was able to style with her existing wardrobe to make it through her pregnancy with confidence.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Inspired by this search, the co-founders developed an idea of a monthly subscription service that would take the pain out of the process and provide classic, wearable fashion essentials for style-obsessed pregnant women, along with an accessory to add a splash of color or texture, and a pregnancy-related beauty product.</p>
<p>In addition to the Style Box, Preggonista is also creating an online community where pregnant fashionistas can become inspired, encourage each other and share information. Enabled by social media and PreggonistaTV, the goal is to make this network a place where women receive support and draw inspiration. We hope to create a virtual home that they will be sad to leave!</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Raising Funds </strong>– We are seeking to raise $20,000 for operating costs, including purchasing unique, stylish and high-quality products for our preggonistas and establishing a spot on delivery system to flawlesly store, pack and deliver each Style Box.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we exceed our goal: We will be able to expand the reach of our service to additional preggonistas. (With the ultimate goal being that we have such a huge, dynamic community of preggonistas that the top high-end brands come knocking down our doors to be in our Style Box! This also enables us to offer the Style Box at a lower price.)</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal: We will launch as planned using the funds raised, but will limit the number of members we can accept.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Establishing Relationships</strong> – We want to develop partnerships with brands and businesses with a common interest in preggonistas and feature products in our Style Boxes and flash sales.</p>

We’d appreciate your support toward making this a reality and hope that we’ll get to meet you either through one of our launch events or on PreggonistaTV!



In July 2012, Tamisha Piper, co-founder, admitted during a hushed phone call with co-founder, Tina Hawkins, that her pants were unbuttoned – while she was at work. Tamisha was nearing her sixth month of pregnancy and still hadn’t bought maternity clothes. Tina, not believing Tamisha’s claim that it was difficult to find maternity clothes, spent the weekend shopping and quickly discovered that, unless one finds muumuus appealing, it was difficult to find stylish maternity wear. The pair finally found six fashion essentials that Tamisha was able to style with her existing wardrobe to make it through her pregnancy with confidence.


Inspired by this search, the co-founders developed an idea of a monthly subscription service that would take the pain out of the process and provide classic, wearable fashion essentials for style-obsessed pregnant women, along with an accessory to add a splash of color or texture, and a pregnancy-related beauty product.
In addition to the Style Box, Preggonista is also creating an online community where pregnant fashionistas can become inspired, encourage each other and share information. Enabled by social media and PreggonistaTV, the goal is to make this network a place where women receive support and draw inspiration. We hope to create a virtual home that they will be sad to leave!



Our fundraiser has two goals:


Raising Funds – We are seeking to raise $20,000 for operating costs, including purchasing unique, stylish and high-quality products for our preggonistas and establishing a spot on delivery system to flawlesly store, pack and deliver each Style Box.

If we exceed our goal: We will be able to expand the reach of our service to additional preggonistas. (With the ultimate goal being that we have such a huge, dynamic community of preggonistas that the top high-end brands come knocking down our doors to be in our Style Box! This also enables us to offer the Style Box at a lower price.)
If we do not reach our goal: We will launch as planned using the funds raised, but will limit the number of members we can accept.

Establishing Relationships – We want to develop partnerships with brands and businesses with a common interest in preggonistas and feature products in our Style Boxes and flash sales.

Whether you’re an individual or business, we have some great perks to stash in your swag bag.




If you can't contribute to the campaign or partner with us, you can still help! Please spread the word about our campaign to your social network.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>My Story<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>- <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I was abused</span>:</h2>
<p>I was in a abusive relationship for 9 years. I started <b>SOUL: Supporters Of Unfettered Love</b>, because I felt soulless, helpless, and loveless during and following those years. I thought my life was over-I was doomed to be miserable because something was ""wrong with me"" -- I was broken and I would never be ""fixed"". I thought what I was experiencing was because ""relationships are hard"" as everyone says -- I didn't know they were not supposed to be <i>this</i> hard. </p>
<p></p>

<h2><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The purpose of this campaign </span></h2>
<p><i>is to turn something awful into something right and good; I was a victim but I don't have to stay a victim. And neither do you. Nor do any of your friends, relatives, or significant others.</i>  I began<b> SOUL </b>because something needed to be done about the overload of abuse occurring in society. Souls need help now-- souls need to see the light out of the darkness that abuse creates when authentic love does not exist or has been corrupted inside a relationship. I want people to experience healing as I have.  My healing came through the loving relationships of my counselor, my family, my friends. We need each other desperately in order to heal our souls.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126028/files/20131010145011-indiegogo004.jpg?1381441811"" src="""" style=""""/> I believe that in order for one to understand whether to ""stay or go"" in a relationship, the number 1 priority is to <i>get well individually</i>. This means any obstacles to receiving personal treatment and help must be overcome-- leaving no excuses for getting well. There was a time when my job income went 95% for my own treatment, but this left nothing to make for a solid financial future. I felt disempowered financially which worsened my symptoms...which increased my need for counseling.... :) I started <b>SOUL</b> to help myself get the treatment I needed and to also help others get the treatment needed to get well, which is essentially ""finding oneself"". </p>

<p>While abuse was going on in my most significant relationship, I was also a licensed associate marriage and family therapist. As the fog from abuse was slowly lifted from my own eyes and as my brain-washed mind began to think for itself again, I found myself empathizing incredibly with the women I worked with; some <i>amazing healing was happening </i>for the women because they said I understood and ""got it"" even though my story was not revealed to them (after all counseling is about my clients, not me). Like my own experience, the financial power to continue paying for counseling was being withheld from my clients by a controlling partner. I saw it right to begin discounting or offering counseling services for free until a woman became well enough to stand on her own. I found out quickly that while this approach was working for my clients, this discounted approach for my own profession was not a sustainable one.</p>
<p>I decided that <b>SOUL </b>would be a for-profit social enterprise because I needed to find a creative way as a relationship therapist to keep offering free or discounted counseling to women coming from abusive relationships while not going under financially myself. I knew I needed to sell a product that could be profitable enough to to be both sustainable from a business model perspective and generous to the cause of helping myself and others get well and rise above abuse.</p>

***UPDATES 10/26/2013 -- a blog about SOULbags from a good friend of SOUL: http://www.thebannicks.com/2013/10/soul-bags/***

My Story - I was abused:
I was in a abusive relationship for 9 years. I started SOUL: Supporters Of Unfettered Love, because I felt soulless, helpless, and loveless during and following those years. I thought my life was over-I was doomed to be miserable because something was ""wrong with me"" -- I was broken and I would never be ""fixed"". I thought what I was experiencing was because ""relationships are hard"" as everyone says -- I didn't know they were not supposed to be this hard. 


The purpose of this campaign 
is to turn something awful into something right and good; I was a victim but I don't have to stay a victim. And neither do you. Nor do any of your friends, relatives, or significant others.  I began SOUL because something needed to be done about the overload of abuse occurring in society. Souls need help now-- souls need to see the light out of the darkness that abuse creates when authentic love does not exist or has been corrupted inside a relationship. I want people to experience healing as I have.  My healing came through the loving relationships of my counselor, my family, my friends. We need each other desperately in order to heal our souls.

 I believe that in order for one to understand whether to ""stay or go"" in a relationship, the number 1 priority is to get well individually. This means any obstacles to receiving personal treatment and help must be overcome-- leaving no excuses for getting well. There was a time when my job income went 95% for my own treatment, but this left nothing to make for a solid financial future. I felt disempowered financially which worsened my symptoms...which increased my need for counseling.... :) I started SOUL to help myself get the treatment I needed and to also help others get the treatment needed to get well, which is essentially ""finding oneself"".

providing help and shelter to injured and homeless animals in Iran. The Vafa
shelter is a non-government charity organization relying solely on private
donations and volunteers.Their shelter
as well as the Center for Animal Lovers has made great strides over the past
few years but there is much more to be done. Please consider making a
contribution for the care of over 400 homeless dogs. 
Part of EasySlide Wallet fund is an
emergency financial assistance program developed to provide immediate
intervention for animals in life-threatening situations. By wallet fund grants

animals from abusive situations; and supported innovative spay/neuter programs, pet meds, food, shelter maintenance and other
expenses. Shelter staff and the animals appreciate your care and concern.

They
organized them in teams and started caring for the dogs by giving them a shot,
two to three pills, and tick medication. Each dog was sprayed with a bright
color (it was actually anti-infection spray) so they could be identified as
having been treated. It was a long day and they must have taken care of at
least 200 dogs.Please go to our gallery to see more doggies who need your help.Preparation for winter months continuesFurry inspectors at work!May I always be the kind of person my

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Aloha, </p>
<p>My name is Lenei and I am a Hawaiian artist and entrepreneur. I decided recently to create my own jewelry because I wanted to own the beautiful Tahitian, gold/silver, pearl, shell, and sea glass jewelry that I see for sale in my local stores, however I could not afford it. I thought it sad that so many Hawaiian products target purely tourists, as they are unattainable to Hawaiians and locals who have the highest cost of living coupled with the lowest average salary, as compared to the American states. Within the Hawaiian Islands, Hawaiian people contribute to the highest rates of depression, suicide, drug addiction, and imprisonment. I want to help evolve my culture by contributing to Hawaiian-owned and made businesses, co-ops, and shares. I plan to sell my jewelry pieces at a fraction of the comparable tourist-driven ones, as well as trade them for food, goods, and services, as Hawaiian tradition dictates. </p>
<p>I have named my company ""La‘anei,"" which means the sacred present (time) because it is important to me to uphold the sacred traditions of my kÅ«puna (ancestors), while evolving my culture and the Hawaiian people. I’ve also chosen a Hawaiian proverb, ""KÄhiko o na akua,"" which means the adornments of the gods because we should feel that we are blessed and adorned with godly/ancestral love each and every day.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I would like $10,000 in order to buy an inventory of jewelry supplies (Tahitian and fresh water pearls, gold, and silver wire, plus soldering and polishing supplies), as well as rent at various markets. Eventually I would like to have my jewelry in stores, and/or open my own Hawaiian-run store/co-op with locally grown and made products. Currently I have spent over $2,000 on equiptment, supplies, and classes to create the pieces you see in the pictures. I am running out of both inventory and money.</p>
<p>I will send you a handpicked shell or piece of sea glass, or freshwater pearl of your choice, either drilled or undrilled when you donate at least $25 to my start-up company.</p>
<p>When you donate at least $100, I will send you one hand-made shell, freshwater pearl, or sea glass silver or gold bangle of your choice. </p>
<p>When you donate $500 or more, you will receive 2 bangles of silver, gold, Tahitian or freshwater pearl, sea glass, or handpicked shell of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Donating to La‘anei allows a Hawaiian to go into business for herself, as well as provides locals and Hawaiians with the opportunity to have the same things offered to tourists at a fraction of the price.

<h3>&gt;Who is Dynasty?</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Dan and I started <strong>Dynasty in 2010</strong> to design unique, Asian inspired pieces to satisfy the urban, fashionable male demographic. Dynasty</strong> was created to represent Chinese and Asian culture. For our 2012 Collection, we're launching the first two rash guards for our Mixed Martial Arts / Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fans, but <strong><em>we need your help in order to make it a reality</em></strong>.</p>
<h3>&gt;Custom Designed Rash Guards for the Elite Athlete<em><br/></em>
</h3>
<p>Are you tired of wearing the same rash guard every one else at the gym wears? Ones that fade out after a few washes? I know your pain because I am an athlete just like you and I wanted a great fitting, ink dye sublimated rash guard without compromising on style. Therefore I created my own rash guard designs to wear while tapping out fools on the mats! (Check out our designs below)</p>
<h3>&gt;What is a Rash Guard?</h3>
<p>A rash guard is a form-fitting sports athletic shirt that is comprised of a polyester and spandex blend, worn during sports activities to wick away sweat, keeping the body cool, dry, and odour free, while tightening and supporting the muscles needed to perform at your best. It also prevents skin on skin contact in contact sports, preventing skin diseases and rashes. Our rash guard is geared towards mixed martial artists / Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners, but can be worn by any athlete practicing any sport.</p>
<h3>&gt;Who is making them?</h3>
<p><strong>Armourtech </strong>will be manufacturing the rash guards. They are a UK-based sports apparel company (also known as Tatami Fightwear), and most recently they produced the very popular Honey Badger Rash Guard by Meerkatsu.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>&gt;What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a small commitment from our fans who are interested in getting their hands on our one of a kind rash guards. We are launching the first two of our rash guard designs to garner initial interest. If it is successful we will launch more designs!</p>
<h3><strong>Bammy The Panda Stickers:</strong></h3>
<p>Bammy The Panda is Dynasty's official mascot. If you choose to contribute to our project for <strong>$5</strong>, you'll get 1 Bammy Sticker of your choice: ""H.A.M."", ""Army"", or ""Lover""! Waterproof vinyl, will last 18 months outdoors, printed in 3” x 4” window, including 3mm white padding around the edge.</p>

<strong>Note</strong>: Each rash guard contains our <strong>Dynasty</strong> ""Old School"" Chinese calligraphy handwriting logo on front chest, <strong>Dynasty</strong> ""Imperial Seal"" stamp on the sleeve, <strong>Armourtech</strong> patch on the hip, and <strong>Armourtech</strong> logo on the back neck. <em>We aren't trying to brand you; we're letting imitators and copycats know that you're wearing the real deal, not a fake knockoff.</em>

<p>London Alexander is the quintessential line for the man in pursuit of exquisite exclusivity.</p>
<p>London Alexander grew up in Squamish, British Columbia. Alexander's career choice stemmed from silk screening hand sewn t-shirts for friends.

His Aunt was instrumental in teaching him basic technical skills and soon after London began applying this knowledge into his own designs.</p>
<p>We are the company that caters to the man who wants clean, well made clothing. All of our pieces are hand-sewn here in Vancouver, British Columbia. We support local business and in return we want our community to support local fashion.</p>

</div></div>","How GRMTAC Began I started out as a volunteer, designing custom apparel for a government agency's nonprofit side.  They would not (and still do not) allow public sale of their items.  As my designs became more popular, I became more frustrated.  I felt that anyone should be able to buy them.  What was available to the public seemed very in-your-face and lacking in artistic vision.  I helped generate more than $1 million designing for a limited audience and now I bring similar, better designs to you.  The name: GRMTAC is short for Green Monster Tactical.  It is an abbreviation I created (and copyrighted) that represents the olive drab green body armor worn by certain military and law enforcement personnel during our operations.The project is simple: by contributing to GRMTAC, you will help to generate more cool apparel.  All of the funding being requested is going to production and inventory.  We have already secured our website; the design work is ongoing and there is no overhead.  All we need is the capital to bring 18 other designs (and growing) to life.  A long term goal for GRMTAC is to support not only to the Wounded Warrior Project and Sheepdog Impact Assistance, but also the Innocence Project, which provides DNA testing to those wrongly convicted of crimes.  We are partriots who stand up for justice and stand against injustice.  Investor Perk: $10 GRMTAC Steel Chevron Logo Bottle Opener         Investor Perk: $20 GRMTAC Original Operator TInvestor Perk: $30 GRMTAC Original Operator T + multitool    Investor Perk: $50 GRMTAC  Operator T x2 + multitoolInvestor Perk: $70 GRMTAC Assault Hoodie

We are a very small startup without enough people and money to accomplish this on our own. Thanks to our many supporters who have enthusiastically contributed to taking on this challenge, however, we have reached a point at which we are confident we will be able to manufacture Orphe on a medium scale provided we can raise enough funds.</p><p>At present we have produced our second prototype shoe and completed our basic software application, and we have also fabricated custom soles to hold the electronic components and uppers designed by a master shoemaker. As long as we don’t run into problems with durability or the production process the current prototype models are ready to be turned into shoes we can ship to backers.</p><p>The first hurdle we will have to overcome in manufacturing Orphe shoes is the fabrication of metal moulds for the custom soles needed to hold the electronic components. This is expensive, and new moulds must be made for each size of shoe. As a result, even if we meet our minimum funding goal we won't necessarily be able to produce a satisfactory range of sizes. We will decide what sizes to produce based on the level of funding we receive and then send backers the one best suited to their measurements.</p><p>The biggest risk of a change in our final product is related to the battery. In our current prototype we are using lithium-ion polymer batteries with protective circuits, and right now they are capable of providing over three hours of continuous use on a single charge.

This crowdfunding campaign succeeded, now on sale in general! You can purchase Orphe on Amazon and others.皆様のおかげでスマートフットウェアOrpheのクラウドファンディングキャンペーンは成功し、現在一般発売中です！Amazon他で購入いただけます。What is orphe?Orphe is a smart-shoes system designed for performance that functions both as a customizable lighting system and a musical instrument/audio-visual controller. The sole of each shoe contains advanced motion sensors, around 100 full-color, serially-controlled LEDs, and a wireless module (patent pending). This technology allows users to intuitively express themselves in new and interesting ways by freely mapping interactions between their movement sand light and sound. We also provide a system that makes it easy for users to share the assets they've created online, and we hope to grow a community of artists and performers working in different media and genres who can take inspiration from each other's use of Orphe hardware and applications.Orpheは照明となり楽器ともなる、パフォーマンスに特化したスマートシューズです。この靴のソールには最新のモーションセンサ、約100のフルカラーシリアル制御LED、 無線モジュールなどが内蔵されており、ユーザは自分のモーションと光と音のインタラクションを自由にマッピングして、直感的に様々な新しい表現を追求することができます（特許出願済）。また、web上でユーザが自分のデザインしたアセットを簡単にシェアできるシステムを提供することで、異なるジャンルのアーティスト同士が触発し合えるようなシェアシステムを提供します。Who are we?no new folk studio Inc. is a Japanese hardware startup launched in November, 2014. We create technology for artists and performers with a focus on wireless interaction and the Internet of Things (IoT).What people are saying about Orphe:
""L.A. Lights were pretty great (and perhaps the original wearable), but they have nothing onOrphe.""
 
""The Orphe is not your average wearable system.""
 
""They're like those light-up shoes that you had when you were a kid -- the ones that blink and flash, activated by the pressure of your tread -- but they're also 200 percent cooler than that.""
 
""Le projet vise à créer une nouvelle forme d’art, mettant en relation les mouvements, la musique et la lumière, en se servant de ce nouveau support audio-visuel… Les possibilités de création deviennent infinies !""
 

Shoe DesignOur goal has been to design shoes that will serve as a canvass or palette for the artists and performers who wear them.Using applications on their smartphones or other devices to customise their shoes' LEDs, Orphe users can wear whatever colours they want. We’ve designed white and black prototypes that look good no matter what colour the lights are.Finding a way to make shoes that have batteries and a host of electronic components inside them has been very challenging, but through close collaboration between a traditional shoemaker and our engineers we’ve been able to achieve a minimalist design that functions well both as an interface and as footwear.Orpheのユーザはスマートフォン等のアプリケーションを通じて、好きな色の光を纏うことが出来ます。我々はどんな色を選択しても魅力的に見える白と黒の二種類の靴をデザインしました。靴のデザインについては、日本の伝統的な靴職人をチームに招き入れました。多数の電子部品や電池を内蔵するOrpheの製法を確立することは大変にチャレンジングですが、エンジニアと靴職人が綿密に話し合うことでミニマルなデザインの中にインタフェースとしての機能とスニーカーとしての機能を両立させることができました。Black ShoesWhite ShoesOn-board electronicsEach Orphe shoe contains a small unified circuit board with an ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor, invensense mpu9150 motion-tracking device, wireless module (Bluetooth LE), and charging circuit. Each sole is also surrounded by a high density LED tape with lights that can be controlled individually by the microprocessor. We have already created two trial circuit boards for use in our prototypes.OrpheにはARM Cortex-M3プロセッサ、InvenSense MPU-9150、 Bluetooth LEモジュール、そして充電回路が一体となった小型の電子基板が内蔵されます。また、オリジナルソールの側面には高密度のシリアル制御のLEDテープが取り付けられ、マイクロプロセッサによってすべてのLEDが個別制御されます。我々はすでに２回試作基板をつくり、それらをプロトタイプに使用しています。Orphe shoes can be used in conjunction with various applications on smartphones or computers via a Bluetooth connection. We provide a free iOS application that allows users to control the lights on the shoes and integrate Orphe into their performances (Android and OSX versions are stretch goals and will be developed if enough funds are raised). We also want to release an SDK to make it easy for anyone to create applications that make use of the Orphe hardware, and we encourage users to develop and release their own applications.OrpheはスマートフォンやコンピュータにBluetoothで接続し様々なアプリケーションと連携することのできるスマートシューズです。我々はOrpheの光り方を操作したり、Orpheで演奏を行うためのベーシックなiOS専用アプリケーションを無償で提供します（android版、OSX版はファンディング達成金額に応じて提供が決まります）。また我々はOrpheと連携するアプリケーションをつくるためのSDKを公開したいと考えています。ユーザ自身が自分の開発したアプリケーションをマーケットに公開することも促進していきます。Development update #1Easily and intuitively create custom illumination designsThe shoes' illumination can be controlled easily and intuitively using a tablet, and the designs you create can be uploaded to the shoes. We will also make it easy to upload your illumination designs and share them with your friends on the Internet.タブレットを使って簡単に靴の光り方を操作することができます。またデザインした色をweb上にアップロードして友人とシェアすることが可能です。Orphe's lights can be set to change along with the speed and orientation of a dancer's movements, allowing for various forms of expression and performance - giving motion an “aura”, for example, or creating a design using after-images. (The image above is an unedited photo taken with a normal DSLR camera without any CGI).Orpheは向きや速度に応じて光の強さや色を変え、動きをオーラのように見せることや残像で模様を表現することができます。Control various performance elements with your feet.The 9-axis sensors embedded in each sole pick up the movements of each shoe in real time. These data can then be used to wirelessly control various external devices, allowing the shoes to function as musical instruments, video game controllers, foot switches, etc.ソールに内蔵された９軸センサはリアルタイムに靴の動きを検出し、コンピュータに送信します。このデータは光や音に変換するだけでなく、ビデオゲームのコントローラとして利用することや、インターネットに接続された様々なモノを操作することができます。Share sound/light/gesture designsSounds, lighting designs, and gestures can be uploaded and shared with other users on the Internet. For example, a user might practice by imitating the gestures of a dancer they want to emulate.Webを通じて自分のデザインした音、光、ジェスチャをアップロードし、他のユーザーにシェアすることができます。例えば上手なダンサーのシェアしたジェスチャを真似することで、ダンスの練習を効果的にすることができます。Open APIWe have open-sourced elements of our Orphe software and made it easy for other developers to create various applications for our hardware. We provide libraries for open source platforms such as OpenFrameworks, Processing, Pure Data, and Max/MSP, and we encourage the entire user community to further extend the system's capabilities.我々はOrpheのプログラムを一部オープンにし、他のデベロッパーがOrpheを使った様々なアプリケーションを簡単に開発できるようにします。我々はOpenFrameworks, Processing, Pure data, Max/MSP といったオープンソースプラットフォームに対応したライブラリを提供し、ユーザーコミュニティ全体でOrpheを更に進化させていくことを促進します。Funding goals and perksWe need funding to:
Make the metal moulds for our custom soles
Make uppers (the parts of a shoe above the sole)
Make circuit boards
Make approximately 100 LED lights for each pair of shoes.
Obtain wireless regulatory approval
Cover the cost of developing software applications
Because new moulds have to be made for each size of shoe, the amount of money we raise will determine how many sizes we can produce. If we raise enough we may also be able to increase the number of engineers working on the project and extend the compatibility of our software application to other operating systems.If we raise $30,000: 3 shoe sizes + iOS applicationIf we raise $50,000: 5 shoe sizes + iOS, OSX applicationsIf we raise $70,000: 7 shoe sizes + iOS, OSX, Android applicationsファンディングの資金は主に
特殊形状ソールの金型の製造
靴のアッパーの製造
基板の製造
１足役200個のフルカラーLED
無線規格の認可
アプリケーションの開発費
に使われます。特に特殊形状ソールの金型の製造は靴のサイズ毎に金型をつくる必要があるため、我々はファンドの達成額に応じてサイズ展開の数を変えていきます。また達成額に応じてエンジニアを増員し、対応アプリケーションも増やしていきます。
達成額30000ドルの場合：3サイズの展開, iOS App
達成額50000ドルの場合：5サイズの展開, iOS App & OS X App
達成額70000ドルの場合：7サイズの展開, iOS App, OS X App & Android Application
PerksRisks & ChallengesCreating smart-shoes with embedded circuit boards and batteries that can withstand a dancer’s movements will not be easy. We are a very small startup without enough people and money to accomplish this on our own. Thanks to our many supporters who have enthusiastically contributed to taking on this challenge, however, we have reached a point at which we are confident we will be able to manufacture Orphe on a medium scale provided we can raise enough funds.At present we have produced our second prototype shoe and completed our basic software application, and we have also fabricated custom soles to hold the electronic components and uppers designed by a master shoemaker. As long as we don’t run into problems with durability or the production process the current prototype models are ready to be turned into shoes we can ship to backers.The first hurdle we will have to overcome in manufacturing Orphe shoes is the fabrication of metal moulds for the custom soles needed to hold the electronic components. This is expensive, and new moulds must be made for each size of shoe. As a result, even if we meet our minimum funding goal we won't necessarily be able to produce a satisfactory range of sizes. We will decide what sizes to produce based on the level of funding we receive and then send backers the one best suited to their measurements.The biggest risk of a change in our final product is related to the battery. In our current prototype we are using lithium-ion polymer batteries with protective circuits, and right now they are capable of providing over three hours of continuous use on a single charge. We may use a different battery, however, if we can find one that carries a larger charge, is safer, and is small enough to fit inside a shoe. If this occurs it may result in minor changes to the design of our shoes.We may run into difficulties that will delay shipment of our product. We will post regular updates to keep backers informed of our progress and respond to comments and questions as quickly as we can.※Delivery of perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.基板や電池、LEDを内蔵し、ダンサーの激しい動きにも耐えるスマートシューズを製造することは容易ではありません。我々はとても小さなスタートアップ企業であり、人手も予算も十分ではありません。しかし一方でこのチャレンジングなプロジェクトに献身的に参加してくださる多くのサポーターのおかげで、現在の我々は適正な予算が確保できればOrpheの中量生産が可能な状況まで至ることができました。現在我々は２回目の試作基板と基礎的なアプリケーションを完成させ、また電子部品を内蔵できる特殊形状のソールと熟練した靴職人のデザインしたアッパー部を完成させています。耐久性や生産手順の確定といった問題を除けば、現在の試作でも普通の靴として履くことができ、パフォーマンスを行うことができます。このチャレンジを行う上でまずネックとなるのは、電子部品を内蔵できる特殊形状のソールの金型の製造です。金型の製造はそれぞれが高価な上に靴のサイズの分必要になります。そのため最低限のゴールを達成した場合でも十分なサイズ展開ができるわけではありません。我々は達成金額に応じてサイズ展開を決定し、その後backerに最適なサイズの靴を郵送します。またこのチャレンジを行う上でもっとも変更のリスクが高いのは、電池に関する仕様です。我々は現在の試作に保護回路付きのリチウムイオンポリマー電池を使用しています。現在の仕様では一回の充電で３時間以上の連続使用が可能です。しかしスニーカーに内蔵できるほど小さく、大きな放電を行える、より安全な電池を探すことができれば、電池を変更する可能性があります。この変更によってスニーカーのデザインにも若干の変更が加えられる可能性があります。Development processRight now we are developing Orphe at a shared factory/office called “DMM.make AKIBA” in Akihabara, Tokyo, and using the machines available there we have been able to construct many Orphe prototypes.私たちは東京、秋葉原のシェアファクトリー付きのシェアオフィス DMM.make AKIBA に入居しており、Orpheの試作品の多くはそのファクトリー内の機械を使って作られました。TimelineSupportersno new folk studio Inc. is supported by ABBA Lab Inc., a company that invests in Internet of Things (IoT) hardware prototyping.no new folk studio はIoT(Internet of things)ハードウェアのプロトタイピングへの投資育成を行っている株式会社ABBA Labのサポートを受けています。We are receiving assistance from Cerevo, a hardware startup company founded by Takuma Iwasa and based in Tokyo since 2007, in developing Orphe and bringing it to market as a consumer product.株式会社Cerevoは岩佐琢磨氏が2007年に設立したハードウェアスタートアップの先駆け的企業です。Orpheの製品化に当たって、我々は株式会社Cerevoの協力を受け開発を進めます。We are also receiving support from GUGEN, a contest that recognizes devices that represent “what will be normal in the future” and supports their realization as products.「未来のふつう」となるデバイスやアイデアを評価し、具現化をサポートするコンテスト「GUGEN」のサポートを受けています。Special Thanks

</div></div>","Our Story


Three
years ago I had a fall which has led to a chronic pain condition
affecting both my knees. As a result I use a wheelchair. I am seeking sponsorship for an upcoming event in Orlando, Florida.

I
do Cheerleading 'stunting' from my wheelchair. This had never been
done before. I had to fight initially to get acceptance from the
local gyms and national governing bodies but once they saw what I
had achieved in the first month of my return to the sport they soon
began take notice. I now have a team comprising myself, a â€˜flyerâ€™
and two 'spotters' for safety. 
Some American coaches came to the UK
in 2010 and met with me at the national championships in Bournemouth.
They organised an invitation for my team to perform at the 2011
Cheerleading World Championships at Disney World, Orlando, Florida.

Following
the success of last yearâ€™s performance, the organisers of the 2012
World Championships (the IASF) have once again invited us to perform
(April 18th -
2nd May).
We have been working on our routine and believe we can once again
â€˜wowâ€™ the crowd with an even better performance than last year. I
believe this is important as it heightens awareness of disability and
what disabled people are capable of. It also inspires other
wheelchair users to get involved in sport.

Quotes
from some of my â€œfansâ€:

â€œThe

</div><p> </p></div>","Modern Cyclist Apparel x Life-Saving FashionAs members of the alternative transportation community, we couldn’t understand why we were forced to sacrifice fashion for function in order to stay safe when riding our bikes, scooters, or skateboards.So, we did something about it.In October 2015, we decided we were through complaining about the lack of clothing that combined safety and style, and we put our heads together to create a line of cyclist apparel that was fashionable and fun, with the ability to save lives of urban cyclists.From there, Urban Circus was born.Our high visibility jacket can reduce the risk of accidents on the road by 70% with its fluorescent and reflective technology, all without sacrificing fashion or comfort.Certifiably Safe CyclingThe Urban Circus High Visibility Cycling Jacket comes equipped with enough reflective and fluorescent material to keep you visible in any lighting condition, any time, day or night.But don’t just take our word for it.Our jacket complies with the European Standardisation Organisation (ESO) as certified protective visibility clothing for non-professional use (reference NF EN-1150), so you can ride with peace of mind every time you zip up.  Fluorescent Material for Daytime CommutesDon’t risk your safety during your morning or afternoon rides.The Urban Circus High Visibility Cycling Jacket features polyester fabric designed with specific pigments to capture invisible UV light that is emitted by the sun and is reflected through visible light.By making the material appear more colorful and pairing the fluorescence with a contrasting fabric, the visibility of the jacket is increased under direct sunlight and low natural light, so you never need to worry about getting lost under cloud cover, fog, at dusk, or at dawn. Retroreflective Material for Night RidesDon’t just count on the red blink of your bike’s reflectors to keep you visible in the dark.Our retroreflective material combines glass beads with a prismatic technology that join forces to reflect light back in the direction of its source (e.g. a car’s headlights) from any angle, so you’re always riding in the light.

The idea of the Manta Ray was to combine a vintage aesthetic dive case and incorpororate it into a modern dive watch with modern elements and parts. The case is crafted of the industry standard for well built timepieces, solid 316L Stainless Steel and features mirror polishing on the sides of the case while the top portion including the caseback are finely brushed, without any sharp edges or error. This is a true dive watch and is water pressure tested in our factory to 200 Meters, the standard for a true diving watch. The case also features a beautifully signed Manta Ray screwed down crown and caseback with proper sealing for that 200 Meters. Instead of a standard etched caseback, we created a 1:1 embossed moulded caseback of the Manta Ray which features amazing detail and is quite visuaully appealing to the eyes. Now, the dimensions are what most dive enthusiasts are looking for - a standard 40MM case diameter, a 47.5MM lug to lug distance, and a very slim profile of just 11.8MM in thickness. My wrist is 6.5"" which is not too big...and this thing wears perfectly across and conforms like a glove, with extreme comfort! Comfort is key when it comes to a well built timepiece because hey, you will be wearing it a lot! In between the lugs it is 22MM - which can accomodate numerous straps from any company you wish. However, considering the comfort of these rubber straps we have produced, I do not think you will be needing one!

Both dial options feature Swiss Made BGW9 Lume, which has a blue glow to it, and is filled in deep. The lume is potent, long-lasting, and done extremely well. This is something I know most enthusiasts need and strive for - which is why we went the extra mile not to only fill the markers with BGW9 lume, but also fill the bezel with BGW9 lume! It is a bit more expensive than layering on a printed dial, but it is well worth it in my opinion and gives off a much stronger and potent glow which will last you the night. A nice reference to the old dive watches of the mid 1900's is the red ""MANTA RAY"" text on the black matte dial, which was featured on some of the first true tool dive watches of mechanical watches. The bezel itself is 120 Clicks , and can be used to time up to 60 minutes for diving...or whatever it is you may want to time! The hands are also vintage like in their broad pointer shape mimicking early dive watches of some other famous swiss brands as well. However, this is truly our design - and this is not a homage watch or anything of that nature.

</h3>
<br/>My name is Lauren Saraswati Zavlunov. <br/>An  ever aspiring Yogini. Mother. Jewelry Designer. Musician. Educator. Explorer.<br/><br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83716/files/20130919070758-blessings_cross_process.JPG?1379599678"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>Ever since I can remember, I have been enamored with stones of all kinds. Childhood found me collecting pebbles and artifacts from every sojourn - tumbling them repeatedly in my hands and treasuring them deep in my pockets.<br/><br/>Today, designing beautiful jewelry with a deep spiritual and emotional message has blossomed into a practice for me. Motherhood, the Divine feminine, and spirituality are all inspirations for my collections.  I specialize in creating custom malas for meditation, but have been also very drawn to creating unique jewelry collections to not only bring joy and light to me personally through their creation, but to share that light with my clients and the world. <br/><br/>I hope that my work brings you a little slice of peace, a touch of inspiration, a dream of the exotic, and a gentle reminder to nurture your own goals and life intentions. Jewelry can be intensely personal: handed down from mother to daughter, gifted to friends and lovers as they share their life journeys…and I am so honored to have my work be a part of your stories. My hope now is that you will be a part of mine.<br/><br/><b>My heart is brimming with ideas and I have yearned for a chance to start a full collection that explores all seven chakras (or energy points) within the body.</b> <br/><br/>I have been asked many times by clients for chakra charms to add to malas, or necklaces and bracelets. Every time I searched for a design out there I never found one that really resonated with me. I would love to bring a sleek and simple design into being that lets the ancient Sanskrit symbols speak for themselves.<br/><br/><br/><h3>~My Goal~</h3>My goal is to create a beautiful and delicate small charm of each Sanskrit symbol for the seven chakras. If my financial goal is not reached to create all seven, I will explore as many chakras as I can!<br/><br/><br/><h3>~Be a Part of the Journey~</h3>Help me start this beautiful journey! Many may not know the capital needed to create a full collection. Jewels of Saraswati is single woman owned (and run!) business and every aspect of your jewelry touches my hands. Without assistance, I would not be able to create more than one charm. My dream is to launch all 7 charms as a collection so that customer can choose which chakra resonates most with them at a given time.<br/><br/>Every piece I create is not only an artistic journey but a spiritual and emotional one. I have already sketched the design for each charm/pendant to be created. My aim is the blend the joy and mystery of spirituality with a chic and minimal design and, as I move Jewels of Saraswati further into eco-friendly initiatives, I would like to cast this design in recycled silver and offer it as part of an eco-conscious collection.<br/><br/>Your contribution will assist me in the physical creation of these designs, one that I know will resonate with so many people both in the Yoga community and beyond!!<br/><br/><br/><h3>~How Your Contribution Will Be Used~</h3>
<p><br/>Your contribution will assist in getting this design through the early stages of creation all the way to creating the first pendants and molds so that it can be cast to the finished necklace designs. Any left over funds will be used toward production of the pendants and any costs of launching the collection.<br/></p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly towards:<br/>CAD Designs (This means a designer will take my original sketches and create a 3D image in professional software.)<br/>Wax Carvings- (artisans will then carve the wax from this image)<br/>Molds for casting<br/>Casting<br/>Casting Labor<br/>Polishing<br/>Finishing<br/>Materials (silver)<br/>Shipping costs<br/>Shipping materials</p>

My name is Lauren Saraswati Zavlunov. An  ever aspiring Yogini. Mother. Jewelry Designer. Musician. Educator. Explorer.

Ever since I can remember, I have been enamored with stones of all kinds. Childhood found me collecting pebbles and artifacts from every sojourn - tumbling them repeatedly in my hands and treasuring them deep in my pockets.Today, designing beautiful jewelry with a deep spiritual and emotional message has blossomed into a practice for me. Motherhood, the Divine feminine, and spirituality are all inspirations for my collections.  I specialize in creating custom malas for meditation, but have been also very drawn to creating unique jewelry collections to not only bring joy and light to me personally through their creation, but to share that light with my clients and the world. I hope that my work brings you a little slice of peace, a touch of inspiration, a dream of the exotic, and a gentle reminder to nurture your own goals and life intentions. Jewelry can be intensely personal: handed down from mother to daughter, gifted to friends and lovers as they share their life journeys…and I am so honored to have my work be a part of your stories. My hope now is that you will be a part of mine.My heart is brimming with ideas and I have yearned for a chance to start a full collection that explores all seven chakras (or energy points) within the body. I have been asked many times by clients for chakra charms to add to malas, or necklaces and bracelets. Every time I searched for a design out there I never found one that really resonated with me. I would love to bring a sleek and simple design into being that lets the ancient Sanskrit symbols speak for themselves.~My Goal~My goal is to create a beautiful and delicate small charm of each Sanskrit symbol for the seven chakras. If my financial goal is not reached to create all seven, I will explore as many chakras as I can!~Be a Part of the Journey~Help me start this beautiful journey! Many may not know the capital needed to create a full collection. Jewels of Saraswati is single woman owned (and run!) business and every aspect of your jewelry touches my hands. Without assistance, I would not be able to create more than one charm. My dream is to launch all 7 charms as a collection so that customer can choose which chakra resonates most with them at a given time.Every piece I create is not only an artistic journey but a spiritual and emotional one. I have already sketched the design for each charm/pendant to be created. My aim is the blend the joy and mystery of spirituality with a chic and minimal design and, as I move Jewels of Saraswati further into eco-friendly initiatives, I would like to cast this design in recycled silver and offer it as part of an eco-conscious collection.Your contribution will assist me in the physical creation of these designs, one that I know will resonate with so many people both in the Yoga community and beyond!!~How Your Contribution Will Be Used~
Your contribution will assist in getting this design through the early stages of creation all the way to creating the first pendants and molds so that it can be cast to the finished necklace designs. Any left over funds will be used toward production of the pendants and any costs of launching the collection.
Your contribution will go directly towards:CAD Designs (This means a designer will take my original sketches and create a 3D image in professional software.)Wax Carvings- (artisans will then carve the wax from this image)Molds for castingCastingCasting LaborPolishingFinishingMaterials (silver)Shipping costsShipping materials

<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">Hello, my name is Marta Antonelli and I'm 26 years old. I design and create wood bags with my father. Over the last 12 months, I have experimented with the application of wood for producing bags and shoes.</span></p>
<p> <em><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;""> ""Our strength is  in innovation - we turn wood into a soft and pliable material""</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;""> How can we accomplish this seemingly impossible feat? Indeed, wood's rigid and heavy appearance belies its true nature.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">We processed a method whereby wood becomes flexible and soft. At this point, however, any further development will require your support.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;""> As I left the IED in June 2012, I pondered on fashion's traditional association with animal materials such as suede, python skin, and leather. What makes these materials so befitting for <strong>fashion?</strong> May it be their softness? Or is it perhaps their weaving and intricate pattern?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">For weeks, we searched for an eco-friendly material, recyclable, durable but soft at the same time - not disregarding those of plant origin - that could replace animal skin. All the sudden, it dawned on us: wood was our answer. Then we realized the first fashion accessories collection entirely in wood.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;""><a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligneah"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/1272/b6zz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">This new ""skin"", <strong>Ligneah, </strong> was created in September 2012 by Marcello and Marta Antonelli; accessories were designed by  <strong> Marta Antonelli</strong>.  Ligneah is more than leather : is ecofriendly, cruelty-free, plant derived recyclable and there is no waste in the processing phase.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">The processing</span></strong></h3>
<p> <span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">At the outset, we manually bonded extremely light wood sheets but our results were far from satisfactory -the material kept on breaking. We tried numerous approaches to no avail. Success was finally attained by laser-etching the wood sheets and bonding them with a natural material.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">We succeeded much to our surprise. Today, however, I can confidently claim that wooden shoes and bags are akin to those made of animal skin but for one minor yet very significant detail: their plant origin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">We conducted laboratory tests to verify the level of wear and water resistance of our materials (waterproofing conferred by a water protection layer applied on wood). Once improved to overcome all tests and patented, our wooden skin was finally ready for use.</span></p>
<p> <strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">Our new material</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5306/5hkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"">Now we present <strong>Ligneah</strong>, a material made from thin sheets of wood, which are bonded to a fabric using an environment-friendly adhesive. Furthermore, to ensure the material is pliable and soft like leather, wood sheets are micro laser etched. Our ultimate goal is environmental preservation; a tree will produce about 100 shoes and 200 bags; what is more, the wood used comes from ethically managed forests in accordance with the whole ecosystem and, by planting a tree for every product sold, we return to the environment 300% more trees than those used; all this thanks to an agreement with <strong>TreeNation. </strong>Our forest is located in Niger: <a href=""http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/674"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/674</a> </span></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1) When can we choose the color of wood, or the Men/Women sneakers size?</strong></p>
<p>A: Following the end of the project, backers will be contacted to confirm color choices and men/women size. <span>So keep an eye out on your Indiegogo message box!</span></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><strong>Are there any other colors / patterns available on Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>No. For now we are only doing three colours: walnut, white multilaminar and orange multilaminar wood.</p>
<p><strong>3) I would like to buy the accessories too, can I do that in 1 contribution?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, you will have to pay in 2 separate contributions.</p>
<p><strong>4) I'd like to buy 2 or more Pixel Wood, can I pay extra using the same perk?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, you would have to place them in a separate order.</p>
<p><strong>5) Am I suppose to manually add shipping?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you have to add shipping on top of your selected perk. </p>
<p><strong>6)</strong><strong> I forgot to add the shipping costs. What to do?</strong></p>
<p>A: No problem, just click CONTRIBUTE NOW and put in the actual amount you need to pay. Select ""No perk, I just want to contribute."" Pay for it and done!

<p>Ciao, sono Marta Antonelli, ho 26 anni e insieme a mio padre disegno e creo borse di legno. Ho trascorso gli ultimi 12 mesi a sperimentare l’applicazione del legno nella produzione di borse e scarpe.</p>
<p><em>“L’innovazione è la nostra forza, il legno diventa morbido.”</em></p>
<p>Come è possibile? Non pensate solo al legno come un materiale rigido, pesante.</p>
<p>Abbiamo scoperto il modo di renderlo flessibile e morbido e vogliamo chiedervi un aiuto per continuare nel nostro lavoro.</p>
<p>Uscita dallo IED nel Giugno 2012 riflettevo sul fatto che la maggior parte della moda si focalizza su materiali di origine animale: pelle di camoscio, pitone, pelle di vitello. Cosa hanno questi materiali di origine animale che li rende così unici? La morbidezza? La tramatura?</p>
<p>Io e mio padre pensammo per settimane ad un possibile materiale ecologico, riciclabile, resistente ma allo stesso tempo morbido, magari anche vegetale, che fosse in grado di sostituire la pelle animale. Alla fine, ci venne in mente il legno!</p>
<p>Realizzammo la nostra prima linea di prototipi e ora siamo qui per chiedere il vostro supporto per produrre la nostra prima collezione.</p>
<p><a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligneah"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/1272/b6zz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>

<p>Questa nuova ""pelle"",<strong>Ligneah,</strong> nasce nel Settembre 2012  dall’idea di Marcello e Marta Antonelli, gli accessori sono disegnati da <strong>Marta Antonelli</strong>.Le nostre borse e scarpe sono ecologiche, di origine vegetale e riciclabili. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5365/xda.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IL PROCEDIMENTO DI LAVORAZIONE</h3>
<p>Inizialmente, provammo ad applicare su alcuni fogli di legno, dei leggeri tagli a mano, ma il legno si spezzava. Continuammo molte altre volte fino a che non capimmo che la cosa migliore era creare sui fogli di legno delle trame con il laser e accoppiarli con un materiale naturale.</p>
<p>Non ci crederete ma ci riuscimmo, e oggi posso dire con sicurezza che scarpe e borse di legno sono molto simili alla pelle animale ma con l’unica differenza che provengono dai vegetali.</p>
<p> Abbiamo effettuato test di laboratorio per verificare il livello di usura e impermeabilità del nostro materiale (impermeabilità conferitagli da un protettivo ad acqua che noi applichiamo sul legno). Una volta superati tutti i test, la nostra nuova pelle era finalmente pronta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>IL NOSTRO NUOVO MATERIALE</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligneah"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5306/5hkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></strong></a></p>
<p>Vi presentiamo <strong>Ligneah</strong>, ovvero un  materiale composto da sottili fogli di legno, accoppiati ad un tessuto  tramite un collante a basso impatto ambientale; successivamente vengono effettuate sul legno delle micro incisioni  al laser; ciò rende il materiale maneggevole e morbido come la pelle.</p>
<p> Puntiamo  alla conservazione dell'ambiente:  con un albero si realizzano circa 200 borse e 100 scarpe. Il legno che utilizziamo, proviene da foreste gestite eticamente nel rispetto dell'intero ecosistema. Inoltre, piantando per ogni prodotto venduto, un albero, ne immettiamo nell’ambiente il 300% in più rispetto al nostro consumo e questo grazie all'accordo con <strong>TreeNation. </strong>Potete visitare virtualmente il nostro bosco che si trova in Niger: <a href=""http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/674"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/674</a>.</p>

MATERIAL CONNEXION ITALIA: "" After fabrics, leather, plastic and metal, soft wood is the fifth element of fashion.....""

                                Vai alla Versione Italiana  
Hello, my name is Marta Antonelli and I'm 26 years old. I design and create wood bags with my father. Over the last 12 months, I have experimented with the application of wood for producing bags and shoes.
  ""Our strength is  in innovation - we turn wood into a soft and pliable material""
 How can we accomplish this seemingly impossible feat? Indeed, wood's rigid and heavy appearance belies its true nature.
We processed a method whereby wood becomes flexible and soft. At this point, however, any further development will require your support.
 As I left the IED in June 2012, I pondered on fashion's traditional association with animal materials such as suede, python skin, and leather. What makes these materials so befitting for fashion? May it be their softness? Or is it perhaps their weaving and intricate pattern?
For weeks, we searched for an eco-friendly material, recyclable, durable but soft at the same time - not disregarding those of plant origin - that could replace animal skin. All the sudden, it dawned on us: wood was our answer. Then we realized the first fashion accessories collection entirely in wood.

    
This new ""skin"", Ligneah,  was created in September 2012 by Marcello and Marta Antonelli; accessories were designed by   Marta Antonelli.  Ligneah is more than leather : is ecofriendly, cruelty-free, plant derived recyclable and there is no waste in the processing phase.
    
The processing
 At the outset, we manually bonded extremely light wood sheets but our results were far from satisfactory -the material kept on breaking. We tried numerous approaches to no avail. Success was finally attained by laser-etching the wood sheets and bonding them with a natural material.
We succeeded much to our surprise. Today, however, I can confidently claim that wooden shoes and bags are akin to those made of animal skin but for one minor yet very significant detail: their plant origin.
We conducted laboratory tests to verify the level of wear and water resistance of our materials (waterproofing conferred by a water protection layer applied on wood). Once improved to overcome all tests and patented, our wooden skin was finally ready for use.
 Our new material

Now we present Ligneah, a material made from thin sheets of wood, which are bonded to a fabric using an environment-friendly adhesive. Furthermore, to ensure the material is pliable and soft like leather, wood sheets are micro laser etched. Our ultimate goal is environmental preservation; a tree will produce about 100 shoes and 200 bags; what is more, the wood used comes from ethically managed forests in accordance with the whole ecosystem and, by planting a tree for every product sold, we return to the environment 300% more trees than those used; all this thanks to an agreement with TreeNation. Our forest is located in Niger: http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/674 
 
Pixel-Wood: the sneakers revolution
               
 

We introduce you our first Sneakers Collection: Pixel-Wood. The thin wood sheets, thanks to the laser engraving, become like a picture composed by small pixel.
Our shoes are entirely made in wood and  with a latex sole; they are available and in three different variety of wood (with a visible wood grain): walnut, orange or white multilaminar wood . 
 
   




 
 We need your support:

 
Our goal has been partially attained: we have created our first prototypes made entirely of wood and turned wood into a pliable material. However, this is not the end of the journey. Help us improve and continue our pursuit of eco-friendly materials. We require  Euro 10,000:
-  To acquire and produce new material.
-   To present our new limited edition collection of wooden shoes, bags and accessories.
-  To fine-tune our material and conduct further experiments, improving the Ligneah brand.
If you wish to contribute, please review our perks and choose the one you fancy the most; no matter where your preference lies, your fashion choice will be a cruelty-free one. If you do not want to contribute with a perk, share this link with all your friends; the greater the awareness, the easier it would be to make today's fashion a cruelty-free one.
On the other hand, do not hesitate to contact us should your blog deal with issues of environmental sustainability connected with fashion.

Ciao, sono Marta Antonelli, ho 26 anni e insieme a mio padre disegno e creo borse di legno. Ho trascorso gli ultimi 12 mesi a sperimentare l’applicazione del legno nella produzione di borse e scarpe.
“L’innovazione è la nostra forza, il legno diventa morbido.”
Come è possibile? Non pensate solo al legno come un materiale rigido, pesante.
Abbiamo scoperto il modo di renderlo flessibile e morbido e vogliamo chiedervi un aiuto per continuare nel nostro lavoro.
Uscita dallo IED nel Giugno 2012 riflettevo sul fatto che la maggior parte della moda si focalizza su materiali di origine animale: pelle di camoscio, pitone, pelle di vitello. Cosa hanno questi materiali di origine animale che li rende così unici? La morbidezza? La tramatura?
Io e mio padre pensammo per settimane ad un possibile materiale ecologico, riciclabile, resistente ma allo stesso tempo morbido, magari anche vegetale, che fosse in grado di sostituire la pelle animale. Alla fine, ci venne in mente il legno!
Realizzammo la nostra prima linea di prototipi e ora siamo qui per chiedere il vostro supporto per produrre la nostra prima collezione.


Questa nuova ""pelle"",Ligneah, nasce nel Settembre 2012  dall’idea di Marcello e Marta Antonelli, gli accessori sono disegnati da Marta Antonelli.Le nostre borse e scarpe sono ecologiche, di origine vegetale e riciclabili. 

 
IL PROCEDIMENTO DI LAVORAZIONE
Inizialmente, provammo ad applicare su alcuni fogli di legno, dei leggeri tagli a mano, ma il legno si spezzava. Continuammo molte altre volte fino a che non capimmo che la cosa migliore era creare sui fogli di legno delle trame con il laser e accoppiarli con un materiale naturale.
Non ci crederete ma ci riuscimmo, e oggi posso dire con sicurezza che scarpe e borse di legno sono molto simili alla pelle animale ma con l’unica differenza che provengono dai vegetali.
 Abbiamo effettuato test di laboratorio per verificare il livello di usura e impermeabilità del nostro materiale (impermeabilità conferitagli da un protettivo ad acqua che noi applichiamo sul legno). Una volta superati tutti i test, la nostra nuova pelle era finalmente pronta.
 
IL NOSTRO NUOVO MATERIALE

Vi presentiamo Ligneah, ovvero un  materiale composto da sottili fogli di legno, accoppiati ad un tessuto  tramite un collante a basso impatto ambientale; successivamente vengono effettuate sul legno delle micro incisioni  al laser; ciò rende il materiale maneggevole e morbido come la pelle.
 Puntiamo  alla conservazione dell'ambiente:  con un albero si realizzano circa 200 borse e 100 scarpe. Il legno che utilizziamo, proviene da foreste gestite eticamente nel rispetto dell'intero ecosistema. Inoltre, piantando per ogni prodotto venduto, un albero, ne immettiamo nell’ambiente il 300% in più rispetto al nostro consumo e questo grazie all'accordo con TreeNation. Potete visitare virtualmente il nostro bosco che si trova in Niger: http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/674.
 
PIXEL-WOOD: LA RIVOLUZIONE DELLE SNEAKERS


 
 
Ecco a voi la nostra prima collezione di sneakers: Pixel-Wood. Le abbiamo chiamate così perchè la lavorazione laser rende il legno composto da piccolissimi pixel, mantenendo le sue venature originali.
Le nostre scarpe sono interamente composte da legno e lattice; sono disponibili in tre tipi di legno : noce (che ha le visibili venature tipiche del legno) multilaminare bianco e multilaminare arancione.
Questi sono i nostri prototipi e grazie al vostro supporto, potremmo lanciare la nuova linea di sneakers in legno.






 
 
 ABBIAMO BISOGNO DEL VOSTRO SOSTEGNO:
Il nostro obiettivo è stato in parte raggiunto: abbiamo creato i nostri primi prototipi completamente in legno, abbiamo reso il legno duttile, ma non vogliamo fermarci qui. Aiutaci a migliorare e continuare la ricerca di materiali ecosostenibili, ci servono 10.000 EURO per:
-          Acquistare e produrre nuovo materiale.
-          Presentare la nostra nuova collezione in edizione limitata di borse ed accessori in legno.
-          Perfezionare il nostro materiale ed effettuare nuove sperimentazioni, migliorando il marchio Ligneah.
Se volete aiutarci, date un’occhiata ai nostri premi e scegliete quello più vicino ai vostri gusti, farete una scelta alla moda ma allo stesso tempo cruelty-free. 
Donare non è l'unico modo di aiutarci: diffondete questo link a tutti i vostri amici, più gente ci conosce e più avremo il modo di rendere la moda di oggi cruelty free.
Inoltre se possiedi un blog che tratta argomenti di moda ed ecosostenibilità econtattaci, saremo lieti di conoscervi.

    The LucidaCam is a graphics tool that can help you trace the correct perspective view of your subject, quickly and easily. You see the complete view of your subject in front of you through the LucidaCam viewer.  Not partial views or upside down as in other ""Lucida"" type drawing devices.
</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/116086/files/20131006095534-LucidaLarge2.jpg?1381078534"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/116089/files/20131006095607-LeftRightPam.jpg?1381078567"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/116095/files/20131006095628-Dsc00104.jpg?1381078588"" src="""" style=""""/><p>
    The LucidaCam was created using state of the art 3D CAD Design Software and prototypes were printed on 3D Printers to test the optics and ergonomics of the design. We feel that THIS! design is hands down the lowest cost, largest view, easiest to look through copy/trace device of its type soon to be available!
</p>
<br/><p>
    With your Funding Help, we can make these devices a reality and available to everyone who wants a LucidaCam. First production ships 60 days after the Kickstarter campaign ends. We are looking at January 2014 to begin shipping orders out and will continue shipping until all orders are filled.
</p>
<br/><p>
<i>(NOTE: Because we have done all our pre-production work we only need to order the injection molds based on our designs, deliver the mold base to the molding house and place the orders for the bendable clamping arms from our suppliers. Other parts like cut mirrors and machined small parts will be made by our shop and assembled with local help - This is our goal!)</i>

    Included with every LucidaCam will be a software CD that has all the LucidaCam instructions, study lessons and tips to help you use the LucidaCam correctly and successfully, and the history of the original Camera Lucida devices from the 1800's to 1960's that inspired the development of the modern day version <b>""LucidaCam""</b> <em>(only for Windows Computers only at this time).</em>

    The LucidaCam can help you get started with any art project by letting you see your projected image right on your drawing paper, canvas, board, leather or cake <em>(Yes! - Cake Decorating!)</em> in correct perspective. Once this is done you will have an accurate view whereby you can trace around this image while looking through the LucidaCam eyepiece.
</p>
<p>
    You can transfer an image from your computer, photograph or other subject to your work media. Even Tattoo artists have used our prototypes to transfer art from a design to carbon paper to be applied to a customer for Tattooing.

    As a professional Aerospace Draftsman, Engineer and then Inspector, I always found that I could draw straight lines, parallel lines with square shapes, circles and complex polygons with correct scale and accuracy easily, this is what I did day in and day out.
</p>
<br/><p>
    In moving from being a Draftsman and Engineer to wanting to become an Artist for personal enjoyment, I discovered that drawing a Landscape Scene, a Vase, Flowers, Animals or Birds, the Human Form or a Face was like hitting a giant brick wall.
</p>
<br/><p>
    My drawings looked like a 7 year old attempted the feat, the things I learned as a draftsman had virtually no correlation to drawing real life scenes or objects that were not rocket engines, space shuttles, airplanes and the thousands of sub component parts I was used to drawing.
</p>
<br/><p>
    This was beyond frustrating!  How is it that I could I draw a Billion Dollar Spacecraft and fail to be able to draw even a simple creature like the Blue Crabs that I so loved to catch and eat in the summer months on the Jersey Shore.
</p>
<br/><p>
    Frustration had only gotten worse when I was too busy to attend art classes to learn to draw real life subjects was out of the question, I had no time because of work schedules, money and transportation issues were mounting. <b>I Love Art</b> and want to draw and paint like the Masters, I needed to find a Solution.

    After searching the internet for a device purportedly called a ""Camera Lucida"" whereby a subject could be drawn from still life or landscape and accurately transferred to paper in the correct perspective, I felt that this might possibly be the solution.
</p>
<br/><p>
    Ancient Camera Lucidas from as far away as France and Israel were purchased at great expense to be able to reverse engineer the optics behind the <em>original</em> early designs and discover how they worked or didn’t work as was the case.
</p>
<br/><p>
    These early Camera Lucidas were disassembled and studied to discover the advantages and disadvantages of the tiny glass prisms optical qualities. It was discovered through trial and error testing with an actual original early 1900's Camera Lucida obtained from Israel (and made by the French optics manufacturer P. Berville of Paris), that viewing and squinting to see through such a tiny prism is difficult at best and only offers a partial image that must be constantly adjusted and moved to allow for drawing the whole scene.
</p>
<br/><p>
    The early photographic pioneer “William Fox Talbot” who in 1833, was so disappointed with the Tiny Viewing Prism used in the Camera Lucida that it drove him to invent photography, to “Cause these images to imprint themselves durably”.

    We have learned from experimentation with the mirrored prism mistakes others historically have made in the past, and developed a means to obtain the same effect of transferring a viewed image to paper or other art media accurately using 3D Printed CAD prototype models.
</p>
<p>
    We have studied the optical qualities of using 2 plastic mirrors to obtain the larger higher quality image results, and a far greater viewing field which allows for less strain with greater clarity because you are not constantly “Squinting” and adjusting to see through a tiny prism.

  It might be falsely stated that the LucidaCam is just a copy of the 1950’s 60’s “Master Art Helper” copying device made popular in advertisement sections of Popular Science and similar magazines.

<br/><p>
    This would simply be like comparing the fact that Aircraft built in the 1950’s are still old and outdated today simply because they share the same fact that they have Engines and Wings!.  Today we have Mach 3+ Aircraft and we have sent spacecraft outside our solar system while Rovers travel around the surface of Mars. Things have changed since the 1950’s, and the LucidaCam has incorporated all the advancements available to us using the most modern means at our disposal.
</p>
<br/><p>
    We obviously know that since the 1950’s, Computers and 3D Modeling of designs have come along and allowed us to develop a new and far more advanced version of the earlier table top copy devices popularized in the backs of magazines. The LucidaCam addresses all the older failings and is a Modern version<i>""On Steroids!""</i> that uses a “Different” mirror angle <em>(Not the 45 Degree angle of mirrors used for years in those devices).</em>
</p>
<br/><p>
    We found an angle that works <i>BETTER!</i> Enclosing the mirrors inside a cylindrical black ABS tube isolates the viewing image in darkness to allow for better viewing. No more rigid rods or erector-set type large and bulky mounting arms that won’t allow for simple quick adjustments.

    The LucidaCam can be used by both Right and Left handed artists because of the large 18 inch long bendable arm and sturdy clamp base.

    We are relying on 100% American made parts to build the LucidaCam.  We decided that the bendable mounting arms that could have been sourced from cheaper Chinese manufacturers were not up to the quality standards we demanded. So we found a reliable American manufacturer to supply these higher quality stronger arms.
</p>
<br/><p>
    The cheaper Chinese flex arms would not retain their memory in place and wiggled while clamped to a table, which made it difficult to draw, although costing twice the Chinese prices <i>we think the quality justifies the added cost!.</i>
</p>
<br/><p>
    The injection molded <i>LucidaCam</i> body parts will be made in New Jersey at an injection molding house that makes over 11 million dollars worth of medical grade plastic components each year therefore the quality of our LucidaCam will Not be compromised by cheap overseas molding houses.

<br/><p>
    The 2 internal Primary and Secondary mirrors will be made from American plastics and laser cut here in Pennsylvania. The small internal screw cap holding the LucidaCam to the Bendable Arm will be machined in Pennsylvania as well. And all components will be assembled and tested using local labor here in PA.

</p></span></span></span></span></div>","The LucidaCam is a graphics tool that can help you trace the correct perspective view of your subject, quickly and easily. You see the complete view of your subject in front of you through the LucidaCam viewer.  Not partial views or upside down as in other ""Lucida"" type drawing devices.


    The LucidaCam was created using state of the art 3D CAD Design Software and prototypes were printed on 3D Printers to test the optics and ergonomics of the design. We feel that THIS! design is hands down the lowest cost, largest view, easiest to look through copy/trace device of its type soon to be available!


    With your Funding Help, we can make these devices a reality and available to everyone who wants a LucidaCam. First production ships 60 days after the Kickstarter campaign ends. We are looking at January 2014 to begin shipping orders out and will continue shipping until all orders are filled.


(NOTE: Because we have done all our pre-production work we only need to order the injection molds based on our designs, deliver the mold base to the molding house and place the orders for the bendable clamping arms from our suppliers. Other parts like cut mirrors and machined small parts will be made by our shop and assembled with local help - This is our goal!)


    Included with every LucidaCam will be a software CD that has all the LucidaCam instructions, study lessons and tips to help you use the LucidaCam correctly and successfully, and the history of the original Camera Lucida devices from the 1800's to 1960's that inspired the development of the modern day version ""LucidaCam"" (only for Windows Computers only at this time).



LucidaCam CD with Instructions, Tips Camera Lucida History


    The LucidaCam can help you get started with any art project by letting you see your projected image right on your drawing paper, canvas, board, leather or cake (Yes! - Cake Decorating!) in correct perspective. Once this is done you will have an accurate view whereby you can trace around this image while looking through the LucidaCam eyepiece.


    You can transfer an image from your computer, photograph or other subject to your work media. Even Tattoo artists have used our prototypes to transfer art from a design to carbon paper to be applied to a customer for Tattooing.


    As a professional Aerospace Draftsman, Engineer and then Inspector, I always found that I could draw straight lines, parallel lines with square shapes, circles and complex polygons with correct scale and accuracy easily, this is what I did day in and day out.


    In moving from being a Draftsman and Engineer to wanting to become an Artist for personal enjoyment, I discovered that drawing a Landscape Scene, a Vase, Flowers, Animals or Birds, the Human Form or a Face was like hitting a giant brick wall.


    My drawings looked like a 7 year old attempted the feat, the things I learned as a draftsman had virtually no correlation to drawing real life scenes or objects that were not rocket engines, space shuttles, airplanes and the thousands of sub component parts I was used to drawing.


    This was beyond frustrating!  How is it that I could I draw a Billion Dollar Spacecraft and fail to be able to draw even a simple creature like the Blue Crabs that I so loved to catch and eat in the summer months on the Jersey Shore.


    Frustration had only gotten worse when I was too busy to attend art classes to learn to draw real life subjects was out of the question, I had no time because of work schedules, money and transportation issues were mounting. I Love Art and want to draw and paint like the Masters, I needed to find a Solution.


    After searching the internet for a device purportedly called a ""Camera Lucida"" whereby a subject could be drawn from still life or landscape and accurately transferred to paper in the correct perspective, I felt that this might possibly be the solution.


    Ancient Camera Lucidas from as far away as France and Israel were purchased at great expense to be able to reverse engineer the optics behind the original early designs and discover how they worked or didn’t work as was the case.

Early 1900's Antique Camera Lucida

    We have studied the optical qualities of using 2 plastic mirrors to obtain the larger higher quality image results, and a far greater viewing field which allows for less strain with greater clarity because you are not constantly “Squinting” and adjusting to see through a tiny prism.


  It might be falsely stated that the LucidaCam is just a copy of the 1950’s 60’s “Master Art Helper” copying device made popular in advertisement sections of Popular Science and similar magazines.


    This would simply be like comparing the fact that Aircraft built in the 1950’s are still old and outdated today simply because they share the same fact that they have Engines and Wings!.  Today we have Mach 3+ Aircraft and we have sent spacecraft outside our solar system while Rovers travel around the surface of Mars. Things have changed since the 1950’s, and the LucidaCam has incorporated all the advancements available to us using the most modern means at our disposal.


    We obviously know that since the 1950’s, Computers and 3D Modeling of designs have come along and allowed us to develop a new and far more advanced version of the earlier table top copy devices popularized in the backs of magazines. The LucidaCam addresses all the older failings and is a Modern version""On Steroids!"" that uses a “Different” mirror angle (Not the 45 Degree angle of mirrors used for years in those devices).


    We found an angle that works BETTER! Enclosing the mirrors inside a cylindrical black ABS tube isolates the viewing image in darkness to allow for better viewing. No more rigid rods or erector-set type large and bulky mounting arms that won’t allow for simple quick adjustments.

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have been running programs around the streets in Palestine, in whatever space we can get. To ensure our programs remain sustainable, and continue to serve the community - we need to establish a home in the form of a gym, that can accommodate a range of sports programs, including boxing!</p>
<p>We currently have a great boxing coach and an enthusiastic group of boys and girls that train with us regularly. We have been able to raise enough funds to provide the basic equipment, but would love to be able to provide them with a boxing ring to help them better prepare for international competitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Boxing ring will cost us approximately 6000 USD, we have some funds that we are allocating to this, but we are still well short!</li>
<li>Your contribution would be highly valued and would provide the seed funding to develop a dream and launch Palestinian athletes onto the world stage - Think Cuban Olympic Boxing Team, Jamaican Athletes and Palestinians right up beside them on the podium.</li>
<li>Every cent raised will go to the purchase of a boxing ring to support our boxing programs and Palestinian Youth</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>70% of the Palestinian Population is under the age of 24, with excessively high youth unemployment rates and limited access to recreational facilities. Our programs provide a fun and safe outlet with a view towards supporting individuals in pursuing a happier, healthier and more fruitful life.</p>
<p>This includes providing participants with various pathways in sports, both as athletes, or as coaches and administrators. We have partnered with Rise Global (<a href=""http://www.rise-global.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rise-global.com</a>) to look at how to best develop the sector, so as to ensure maximum benefits to Palestinian Youth and the community at large and contributing to a vibrant sports sector in Palestine</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We share our vision with you, so you can also share it with your friends, family and extensive network of like minded, well intentioned folk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share our campaign</li>
<li>Please give whatever you can afford</li>

We have been running programs around the streets in Palestine, in whatever space we can get. To ensure our programs remain sustainable, and continue to serve the community - we need to establish a home in the form of a gym, that can accommodate a range of sports programs, including boxing!
We currently have a great boxing coach and an enthusiastic group of boys and girls that train with us regularly. We have been able to raise enough funds to provide the basic equipment, but would love to be able to provide them with a boxing ring to help them better prepare for international competitions.

A Boxing ring will cost us approximately 6000 USD, we have some funds that we are allocating to this, but we are still well short!
Your contribution would be highly valued and would provide the seed funding to develop a dream and launch Palestinian athletes onto the world stage - Think Cuban Olympic Boxing Team, Jamaican Athletes and Palestinians right up beside them on the podium.
Every cent raised will go to the purchase of a boxing ring to support our boxing programs and Palestinian Youth



The Impact
70% of the Palestinian Population is under the age of 24, with excessively high youth unemployment rates and limited access to recreational facilities. Our programs provide a fun and safe outlet with a view towards supporting individuals in pursuing a happier, healthier and more fruitful life.
This includes providing participants with various pathways in sports, both as athletes, or as coaches and administrators. We have partnered with Rise Global (www.rise-global.com) to look at how to best develop the sector, so as to ensure maximum benefits to Palestinian Youth and the community at large and contributing to a vibrant sports sector in Palestine

<h2><strong>REASONS TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN</strong></h2>
<p>If you've read this far, you probably already want this wireless speaker. In the event you need a few more reasons to get off the fence, take a gander below.</p>
<h3><strong>HELP BIKE MESSENGERS</strong></h3>
<p>The life of a bike messenger is to get your stuff from one part of town to another in the least amount of time. Their day consists of weaving between traffic to get people the stuff they need. One accident can instantly take them out of the work force. They barely make enough wages to get by in the expensive urban areas where they work, let alone create a safety net in case of an emergency. Here is our chance to support a community that is working hard every day to make ends meet.</p>
<h3><strong>SHARE YOUR MUSIC</strong></h3>
<p>Boombots will change your life. They add a soundtrack unlike anything else. Summer is here and you should be getting outside and enjoying it. Whether you're at the beach, boardwalk or taking a hike, there are tons of occasions where you're going to find this product useful.      </p>
<h3><strong>ENJOY SAFER RIDING + STAY CONNECTED</strong></h3>
<p>In many states, riding with headphones is illegal. Those of us who have (or still do, for that matter) biked with headphones long enough can speak to a couple close calls in traffic. Boombots help to connect you with your environment better than headphones. Not only can you bump your tunes, but you can also interface with your phone handsfree, receive directions and command voice control.</p>
<h3><strong>SUPPORT A SMALL STARTUP</strong></h3>
<p>The Boombotix team is a group of ambitious visionaries that want to make the world better through sound. We are creating jobs, driving innovation and pushing the frontier of audio technology. We need your continued support to continue building the devices you love.  </p>
<h3><strong>CONTRIBUTE TO MUSIC TECHNOLOGY</strong></h3>
<p>Our team is currently working to develop an app that allows music to stream to multiple mobile devices in sync. This technology is not only fun for doing group playback but may also have other applications in community development, music discovery and social interaciton.  </p>

<p><img alt=""BMEF Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/indiegogo_boombotix/BMEF-Logo-200x150.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>The <strong>Bicycle Messenger Emergency Fund  </strong>is a 501 c3 non profit public charity organization that provides emergency compensation to bicycle messengers who are hurt on the job. Currently the BMEF allocates a $500 emergency check to help messengers anywhere during the first week of injury. This provides a boost, to both the financial and the emotional state of the injured messenger. The goal is to help the messenger cope and recover. </p>

<p><img alt=""FAQ"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/indiegogo_boombotix/Headers/FAQ.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is the perk value on the page different from the price I see on the right hand column?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The domestic shipping cost of $8 has been included in each perk. For international backers, additional shipping costs should be added to the contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you guys don't reach the $50k goal, will the product still be manufactured?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes. We are already assemblying product. This campaign was primarily to support a charity we care about. Our delivery is still projected for August.  </p>
<p><strong>Q: I want a Boombot REX, but I just want one of the normal colored ones.  Can I still support the campaign?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! You can purchase any of the $108 perks and we will send out a survey at the end of the campaign. You can pick from any available color on the site. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What kind of warranty do you guys offer?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We offer a thing called the No Matter What One Year Warranty. Should you have any problem with the performance of your speaker during the first year of use, you are entitled to free repair/replacement.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">We also offer an </span><a href=""http://boombotix.com/support/exchange"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 10px;"">exchange program</a><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> where you can take any old Boombot speaker and trade it in for a $25 credit towards any new model of your choice.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where are these speakers made? </strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">A: </strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Boombots are made with a contract manufacturer in Shenzhen, China. We have been working with this manufacturer for three years. We have confidence that this manufacturer can deliver a solid product in a timely manner. We have already taken a lot of measurements on this production run to get the projects moving along before this campaign has even started. We are confident that we will be able to get these units to our customers in a timely fashion.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What differentiates these speakers from all the others on the market?  </strong></p>
<p>We have done extensive work on the acoustics and design of our products to insure that it is the industry leader in power-to-size ratio.

Whether on your handle bars or fastened to your pack, the Mudrunner is made for the messiest of adventures. This model was designed by the CEO of our company, Lief Storer. Limited to 1000 pieces worldwide.  

The Plox pattern was initially sketched by hand and vectorized in a 2-color graphic. Think of Plox as the hybrid of gator skin. Designed by Chris McKleroy, our VP of Product, it's tough, relentless, and a true force of nature. Only 1000 pieces available worldwide.

 WHAT YOU CAN GET...








REASONS TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN
If you've read this far, you probably already want this wireless speaker. In the event you need a few more reasons to get off the fence, take a gander below.
HELP BIKE MESSENGERS
The life of a bike messenger is to get your stuff from one part of town to another in the least amount of time. Their day consists of weaving between traffic to get people the stuff they need. One accident can instantly take them out of the work force. They barely make enough wages to get by in the expensive urban areas where they work, let alone create a safety net in case of an emergency. Here is our chance to support a community that is working hard every day to make ends meet.
SHARE YOUR MUSIC
Boombots will change your life. They add a soundtrack unlike anything else. Summer is here and you should be getting outside and enjoying it. Whether you're at the beach, boardwalk or taking a hike, there are tons of occasions where you're going to find this product useful.      
ENJOY SAFER RIDING + STAY CONNECTED
In many states, riding with headphones is illegal. Those of us who have (or still do, for that matter) biked with headphones long enough can speak to a couple close calls in traffic. Boombots help to connect you with your environment better than headphones. Not only can you bump your tunes, but you can also interface with your phone handsfree, receive directions and command voice control.
SUPPORT A SMALL STARTUP
The Boombotix team is a group of ambitious visionaries that want to make the world better through sound. We are creating jobs, driving innovation and pushing the frontier of audio technology. We need your continued support to continue building the devices you love.  
CONTRIBUTE TO MUSIC TECHNOLOGY
Our team is currently working to develop an app that allows music to stream to multiple mobile devices in sync. This technology is not only fun for doing group playback but may also have other applications in community development, music discovery and social interaciton.  
 

The Bicycle Messenger Emergency Fund  is a 501 c3 non profit public charity organization that provides emergency compensation to bicycle messengers who are hurt on the job. Currently the BMEF allocates a $500 emergency check to help messengers anywhere during the first week of injury. This provides a boost, to both the financial and the emotional state of the injured messenger. The goal is to help the messenger cope and recover. 
 

Lucas Brunelle is a professional bike videographer. He has documented biking around the world using his custom helmet cameras. He has been known for capturing riders taking calculated risks. He has pushed riders to go faster and harder than they've ever gone before. Lucas joined the BMEF back in 2009 as his way of giving back to the community he cares about.  We are thankful to have Lucas helping us promote this campaign.
 

The journey with Boombotix never ends. We will be keeping all of our backers updated with the exact metrics of our campaign. You can share your impact with your friends and family and hopefully convince them to get on board for the cause.  Some really easy things to do are:

Share this campaign with your social network (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
Write about your impact on your blog and help raise awareness
Tell your friends about the cause and get people stoked
When you get your Boombot REX, you'll be able to have a soundtrack in your life.  And you can tell everyone about how you helped make the world a better place through your love for music and sound.   

Q: Why is the perk value on the page different from the price I see on the right hand column?
A: The domestic shipping cost of $8 has been included in each perk. For international backers, additional shipping costs should be added to the contribution.
Q: If you guys don't reach the $50k goal, will the product still be manufactured?
A: Yes. We are already assemblying product. This campaign was primarily to support a charity we care about. Our delivery is still projected for August.  
Q: I want a Boombot REX, but I just want one of the normal colored ones.  Can I still support the campaign?
A: Yes! You can purchase any of the $108 perks and we will send out a survey at the end of the campaign. You can pick from any available color on the site. 
Q: What kind of warranty do you guys offer?  
A: We offer a thing called the No Matter What One Year Warranty. Should you have any problem with the performance of your speaker during the first year of use, you are entitled to free repair/replacement.
We also offer an exchange program where you can take any old Boombot speaker and trade it in for a $25 credit towards any new model of your choice.  
Q: Where are these speakers made? 
A: Boombots are made with a contract manufacturer in Shenzhen, China. We have been working with this manufacturer for three years. We have confidence that this manufacturer can deliver a solid product in a timely manner. We have already taken a lot of measurements on this production run to get the projects moving along before this campaign has even started. We are confident that we will be able to get these units to our customers in a timely fashion.  
Q: What differentiates these speakers from all the others on the market?  
We have done extensive work on the acoustics and design of our products to insure that it is the industry leader in power-to-size ratio. You can check out some of the portable speaker comparisons we've done on our blog.",46.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Esty Lingerie</h3>
<p>I launched <a href=""http://www.estylingerie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Esty Lingerie</a> over 3 years ago as a student. Originally a very small site selling only my own creations, it's now the largest online boutique dedicated to independent and handmade lingerie brands.</p>

<p><em>The Buttercup beaded bra in lemon satin from my first collection.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although my own collection is only one of over 30 brands now at Esty Lingerie, it's always been my favourite part of what I do. Since the very first collection, Buttercup (pictured above), my philosophy has always been the same - luxurious lingerie that costs no more than your typical everyday lingerie would.</p>

<p>This means I spend a <em>lot</em> of time researching fabrics and trims to find the best quality at the best price. I also don't spend a fortune on photography, and I sew most pieces myself which keeps production costs down.</p>

<p><em>The Valentine Kiss corset I designed for UK Chocolate Magazine (now UK Gent Magazine). This in ivory and pale gold would be perfect as bridalwear!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm now a bride-to-be myself and it's got me thinking about bridal lingerie all the time! However, everywhere I look I can only find affordable-but-boring bridal lingerie or beautiful pieces that are well out of my (and most people's) price range.</p>

<h3>About My Campaign:</h3>
<p>Hello there, </p>
<p> My names is Vanion Paradis, I am a graphic artist recently out of college. I have a background in Graphic Design, Video Game Design, 2D/3D art and animation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am looking to set up a high quality home printer in order to create, print, and sell my own prints and artwork. Being recently out of school I could use all the help I can get!</p>
</div>
<h3>What I Need To Get Started:</h3>
<p>The printer I'm looking to acquire is approximately $300.00 (including rebates, discounts, and taxes). </p>
<p>The high quality semi-matte paper is around $60 for 50 sheets of the largest size (this can be purchased on demand). </p>
<p>The archival ink (in bulk) costs approximately $80.</p>
<p>Paper cutter and other supplies $20-$150 </p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise at least $360 for the majority of the cost. Of course any amount (less or more) would go a long way in getting me on my feet in this venture. Anything exceeding my goals will go towards a higher quality cutter, more inks, paper styles and sizes, as well as any other supplies that could help make this business become successful.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I'm Giving Back:</h3>
<p> As a thank you for your contributions I have a wide range of prints and packages available for you as the different perks. Some of the packages have the opportunity to have a custom print created, this means that I will be creating a print specifically for you around any subject, person or anything sentimental to you. It's completely up to you!</p>
<p>Please note: I cannot do a custom print featuring any trademarked/copywritten characters not owned by you. I retain the rights to reuse and sell the custom prints, although any personal info and such will be removed. If you own or intend to own a character you want featured in a print, I will not sell or redistribute the print featuring the character without explicit permission.</p>
<p><strong>To take a look at my current selection click </strong><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/VanPrints"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a></p>
<p>Here you can see available prints and their sizes (I will attempt to get sizes as close to the nearest frameable size, possibly using a border as long as it suits the image). As well you can see prints that are coming soon (most of which should be finished by the end of the campaign and will be available to be chosen, but I cannot make any guarantees).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Professional make-up artist Coral Melnyk has offered her time and skills to make abstract canvas paintings to give away as perks for this campaign! Pictures of her previous works will be posted shortly. Visit her website <a href=""http://www.coralmelnyk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.coralmelnyk.com</a> or follow her on twitter @CoralMelnyk (<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/CoralMelnyk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.twitter.com/CoralMelnyk</a>) </p>
<p> If you have a look at the perks you will see I am doing digital/paper sketches. On paper it will be done in black ink or pitt pen on 6x6 bristol board. Preferrably a cartoony request would be easier for me, but I can do more complicated styles when given the time. Same goes for the comic strip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please have a look at the awesome space themed perk packages to the right... Why space themed you might ask? Well it's a fact that everything space themed is just that much cooler (Ex. Dinosaur.... Space Dinosaur. You tell me which is better!)</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Your Impact:</h3>
<p>If this project is successful, it would allow me the opportunity to go to places like Fan-Expo and Comic-Con and have the chance to have signage and sell my work at a reasonable cost. This benefits both myself as well as any potential customers and gives me the opportunity to actually show off my work or do custom prints without having to set orders exceeding 50 copies to get a fair price. </p>
<p> Not to mention this will help me get started on future projects as well, such as hosting charity events with other artists selling/auctioning their work, a children's book with professional make-up artist Coral Melnyk (a project which is currently underway. Story by Coral, Illustrations by me), and much more!</p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>Hi, welcome to DesignsByAlva. Thank you so much for supporting my endeavor to pursue my long-time passion of starting a business and creating fashions made with the needs of people with disabilities in mind. </p>
<p>I'm starting a fashion line consisting of designs inspired by my lived experience as a woman with a disability. My design philosophy is to create fashion pieces that adhere to society's current trends, while successfully incorporating the necessary functional elements needed by people with disabilities. Items include: modified jeans, business attire, water-proof gear with wheelchair attachments, and trench-coats.</p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>I'm currently a 5th year at UC Berkeley working on my senior thesis which is exploring the inaccessibility of the fashion industry to people with disabilities, specifically women. As part of this project, I have gotten the opportunity to begin producing and manufacturing some of my accessible fashion designs. These designs are what I call ""functional fashion"" and keep in mind the accessibility needs of people with disabilities while adhering to existing fashion trends.<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>Our budget, $2,000, is based on making the prototypes and getting my business off the ground. Basically, what your money is going toward is the raw costs to start the business, including materials and labor, because I require physical assistance from other people to manufacture my designs. This also includes sewing, sketching, and shopping for supplies and materials. </p>
<p>If I do not reach the goal, I will use the money to start paying someone to make the designs, buy preliminary supplies, and try to make enough money to get the business started. And if I exceed the funding goal, I will put the money to use in furthering the marketing of my business and being able to produce more products at the outset. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>-Get the word out!</p>
<p>-Volunteer to help to make a logo or help me with a webpage for my new business. </p>
<p>-Help manufacture and sew, or recommend someone who wants to work for me.</p>

With the BH81H smart helmet, you can control turning signals through the bling remote controller to ensure cycling safety.Additionally, the high-visibility LED indicator lights will be your perfect bodyguard against overtaking traffic.SOS Alert 
Unfortunately, accidents are likely to occur. After a bad fall, it can be hard to seek medical help. Our helmet solves this problem. It detects when you fall, and automatically sends a message to a preset emergency contact person who can locate you via the message.Walkie-Talkie Chatting with fellow riders is hard when you're cycling. The BH81H combined with the LIVALL Riding App provides riders an easy to use Walkie-Talkie when cycling. Phone CallsYou won't miss any calls now. Answer and make calls by pressing the button in the middle of the remote controller.Play MusicListening to music with headphones or earbuds while cycling is dangerous; but, the BH81H relies on Bluetooth so you can hear both music and ambient noises around you for safe riding.Snap PhotosThe photo-taking button on the bling remote controller enables you to easily take photos with your phone and store them in the LIVALL Riding App. This is a far safer option that a handheld mobile phone to snap photo is dangerous for riding. Be a rider and a photographer all at once!Bling remote controller can be attached to your handlebar. It allows you to easily control the LIVALL helmet and LIVALL Riding App, while remaining stable and focused. Control volume, skip tracks, pause music, make calls, snap photos and control the colored LED tail-lights to blink like the indicators. You can press the button 'left' or 'right'  to allow people behind you see where you are going.1.Connect the Bling RemoteThe connection will automatically be established when you turn on the helmet and bling remote, you can control the turn signal lights on the helmet via the bling remote.2. Connect the SmartphoneIf you want to play music, answer and make calls, you need to connect the smart helmet with a smartphone over Bluetooth 4.0.3.Connect the LIVALL Riding AppIf you want to activate functions like the heart rate monitor, Walkie-Talkie, photo button, and SOS alert, you need to connect the helmet with LIVALL Riding App.The incredible BH81H is just a starter. We've also started crowdfunding for the MT1, a mountain-biking helmet, and the KS2, a helmet for kids.Mountain Bike Helmet - MT1This smart helmet is specially designed for mountain bikers. With Walkie-Talkie, music playing, turning signal, phone calls, and SOS alert features, the helmet is the perfect choice for enjoying every mountain challenge.Kids Helmet - KS2Protect your child with this stylish helmet.

Parents can easily locate their children.Used cooperatively with LIVALL Riding App, BH81H (or MT1) and bling remote controller will offer riders a variety of functions.LIVALL helmet can quick connect bling remote controller directly.We use EPS foam and PC to make a one-piece helmet. Being puncture resistant and able to endure external impact at high speed, the helmet can scatter the force. With reasonable hole locations, the helmet is safe, well ventilated, comfortable and easy to wear. Between the inner side of the helmet and the head there is a ventilation channel, through which air can enter freely and therefore remove heat and achieve good ventilation. The helmet is also quite light.Adjuster designA high-end adjuster is configured inside the helmet to ensure the helmet is put on your head firmly. In this way, the helmet is safer and more stable. The helmet size can be adjusted.LIVALL helmets conform to international standards, including impact tests.  The shell of the LIVALL helmet comes in multiple colors so that your helmet can reflect your personality. We will contact our backers after the campaign to confirm what color LIVALL helmet you would like. If you don't specify your color, we will select the color for you. An adjuster inside each helmet allows you to fit the helmet snugly to the back of your head. We will contact our backers after the campaign.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Cautionary Tale: The Coffee Shop Story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: left;"">My friend and I were at our local coffee shop one afternoon last year. As I left, I
realized I forgot my wallet on the table inside.<span style=""""> </span>I panicked and ran back to the table, but when I got there,
it was already gone. I approached the barista and asked if they had found my
wallet. When she asked me to describe it, I tried to be as precise as possible,
but she still wanted more details. To my relief, she handed me my wallet and
explained why I had to be so specific; there had been nine wallets left in the
past week alone. </p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This made me realize something important that we usually don’t think about: Both men and women carry oversized, inconvenient wallets.  Like myself, many men remove them from their pockets while sitting to avoid discomfort. In doing so, we take the risk of forgetting them and leaving them on desks, tables, and dashboards. Women often carry their heavy wallets in their purses, weighing down their shoulders and neck.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> After the coffee house experience, which was not the first time I forgot my wallet somewhere, I set out with the intention of finding a wallet that I could carry and sit on comfortably in my pocket.  This meant it had to be light, thin and still have high capacity to fit everything I needed inside. After a long and exhausting search, I realized that it just didn’t exist. So I set out to create my own solution, and that is how WallX™ began.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> But, it was no easy task. It took over a year to perfect my idea because I wanted it to be stylish, as well as functional and high capacity. I wanted my wallet to feel almost invisible, so I sought advice from several sewers, fashion designers, and fabric experts. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> A lot of science went into making WallX. It had to be light and small enough to fit into any pocket without being bulky or stiff, and hold everything that old fashioned wallets twice the size would hold. To achieve all of these features, I knew that I had to use the highest quality elastic available.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> It couldn’t be just any elastic; it had to look sophisticated while being able to withstand vigorous wear and tear. I had to search around the U.S. to finally find what I felt was the perfect elastic that behaved and held up to my standards.  Because of its elastic material, WallX is able to expand and contract according to the users needs. As it stretches, WallX's elasticity keeps all of the users cards and bills securely inside.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It’s also washable, meaning it won’t be damaged by sweat or water, leaving the user free to carry it while working out, biking, motorcycling, golfing, hiking, at the beach, traveling – going anywhere and doing just about anything.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">With the help of some amazing designers, I was able to ensure WallX remained ultra-stylish, for both men and women, without sacrificing comfort and function. But that was not enough. I had to find sewers who could construct the wallets in a way that would make WallX functional, practical, and long lasting. Once I had what I thought was the perfect answer, I made samples to give to as many men and women as possible to try and give their feedback. The input we received from nearly everyone, was that the WallX made the everyday use of a wallet far easier to wear, much more comfortable and much more convenient—and it kept them more organized. For some, they even stated that it literally changed their lives! </p>
<h3>Your Contributions</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">With your help, I want to launch WallX to the next level. Your contributions will cover production costs. I feel that WallX is truly on the cutting edge of wallet design, and with your support it will only get better. Every donation helps and is deeply appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In order to put WallX into as many pockets as possible, I designed the perks with affordability in mind.

A Cautionary Tale: The Coffee Shop Story


My friend and I were at our local coffee shop one afternoon last year. As I left, I
realized I forgot my wallet on the table inside. I panicked and ran back to the table, but when I got there,
it was already gone. I approached the barista and asked if they had found my
wallet. When she asked me to describe it, I tried to be as precise as possible,
but she still wanted more details. To my relief, she handed me my wallet and
explained why I had to be so specific; there had been nine wallets left in the
past week alone. 

This made me realize something important that we usually don’t think about: Both men and women carry oversized, inconvenient wallets.  Like myself, many men remove them from their pockets while sitting to avoid discomfort. In doing so, we take the risk of forgetting them and leaving them on desks, tables, and dashboards. Women often carry their heavy wallets in their purses, weighing down their shoulders and neck.
 After the coffee house experience, which was not the first time I forgot my wallet somewhere, I set out with the intention of finding a wallet that I could carry and sit on comfortably in my pocket.  This meant it had to be light, thin and still have high capacity to fit everything I needed inside. After a long and exhausting search, I realized that it just didn’t exist. So I set out to create my own solution, and that is how WallX™ began.
 But, it was no easy task. It took over a year to perfect my idea because I wanted it to be stylish, as well as functional and high capacity. I wanted my wallet to feel almost invisible, so I sought advice from several sewers, fashion designers, and fabric experts. 
 A lot of science went into making WallX. It had to be light and small enough to fit into any pocket without being bulky or stiff, and hold everything that old fashioned wallets twice the size would hold. To achieve all of these features, I knew that I had to use the highest quality elastic available.
 It couldn’t be just any elastic; it had to look sophisticated while being able to withstand vigorous wear and tear. I had to search around the U.S. to finally find what I felt was the perfect elastic that behaved and held up to my standards.  Because of its elastic material, WallX is able to expand and contract according to the users needs. As it stretches, WallX's elasticity keeps all of the users cards and bills securely inside.
It’s also washable, meaning it won’t be damaged by sweat or water, leaving the user free to carry it while working out, biking, motorcycling, golfing, hiking, at the beach, traveling – going anywhere and doing just about anything.
With the help of some amazing designers, I was able to ensure WallX remained ultra-stylish, for both men and women, without sacrificing comfort and function. But that was not enough. I had to find sewers who could construct the wallets in a way that would make WallX functional, practical, and long lasting. Once I had what I thought was the perfect answer, I made samples to give to as many men and women as possible to try and give their feedback. The input we received from nearly everyone, was that the WallX made the everyday use of a wallet far easier to wear, much more comfortable and much more convenient—and it kept them more organized. For some, they even stated that it literally changed their lives! 
Your Contributions
With your help, I want to launch WallX to the next level. Your contributions will cover production costs. I feel that WallX is truly on the cutting edge of wallet design, and with your support it will only get better. Every donation helps and is deeply appreciated. Thank you.
Perks
In order to put WallX into as many pockets as possible, I designed the perks with affordability in mind. Because WallX would make a great gift for the upcoming holiday season, I will guarantee delivery before 12/25 if your donation is made before 12/1, and only if made through PayPal. Any donations after 12/1 will receive a WallX as timely as possible, but I cannot guarantee a delivery date.

A former Coca-Cola analyst and CFO of Nabisco International/Richardson Vicks: ""Pepsom is the American Dream in Technicolor and will become a ""case study"" in Harvard Business School."" 


Gary Uribe former UCLA Asst. Athletic Performance Coach: ""John, thank you for providing me with samples of Pepsom Fire-Ice product. I have distributed these samples to a few of our football-athletes to utilize over the course of a 2-month period. The feedback I have received from those athletes has been very positive. They have reported that they have received relief from aches and pains and an overall improvement in muscle recovery. Thank you!"" 
 
A gym owner wrote, ""We love the display. All of our parents are excited to know its available, and our head coach used it the the other night after she hurt her knee while teaching, and she says it was amazing. She says it beats Epsom salt hands down."" 
 
Another customer wrote ""I'm a satisfied customer of Pepsom Sport Salt. I'm a former collegiate athlete. I was wondering how I could order BULK amounts of the Sport Salt? Please let me know if there is way to order BULK on-line or through a distributor. I'm dealing with numerous herniated discs in my back and I've found your product to be the BEST on the market.""

Our Group
 
Our founders are John Brown, President with 30 years of retail experience leading to the vast distribution of Pepsom, and the Vice-President and Creative Director Miya Haag, whom created all marketing and designed the vibrant zip-lock pouches which now make the products ""pop"" in the midst of an otherwise dull first aid section.
Our CFO has over 30 years of expertise with some of the top companies in the World.
 
The Company's Advisory Board includes an Executive VP of a professional basketball team, Culp, mentioned above (athletic trainer of 4 U.S. and World Championship teams), former CFO of Nabisco Int'l, etc and 3 retired Senior Executives of Walgreens, Winn-Dixie chains and Perrigo.
 
Our Story 
 
In 2005 while we were working on another project, the Executive VP of 6,000 store retail chain approached Brown and said ""John, bring me Epsom salt, I can't keep it in stock!"" That was the beginning of a two year odyssey of R & D, contracting chemists, pouring our time, financial, other resources into Pepsom, and never even took a salary.
 
We created Pepsom- a new soothing blend with minerals, refreshing formulas with spearmint, wintergreen and peppermint - with 100% natural ingredients and an smooth-flow formula and brought it to the VP of a professional basketball team.  Impressed, it was then brought to their head athletic trainer Ron Culp.   Culp already used 2000 lbs of this mineral per season with some other soothing ingredients. After further research, Pepsom Sports with wintergreen and spearmint blends were formulated.  Culp and other major sports icons have SINCE joined the Pepsom Group.
 

Fast forward - Pepsom  has gained distribution in U.S. food, drug and mass retailers, the internet, and we need your help.  It is in 20,000 stores, yet people only currently learn about Pepsom through word-of-mouth.  Fortunately it is so effective that word is spreading, because once people use it, they never stop! THE SPORTS ICONS IN THE PEPSOM GROUP are committed to making PEPSOM INTO A MAJOR SPORTS BRAND. 

WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTION, YOUR NAME OR YOUR TEAM'S NAME WILL JOIN IN WITH THESE AWARD-WINNING AND IMPORTANT EARLY SUPPORTERS OF PEPSOM. BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR TODAY! BE LISTED AMONGST THE FIRST ON OUR LIST OF PEPSOM VISIONARIES - ON OUR ""PEPSOM - I WAS FIRST"" PLAQUE - which will hang in our corporate headquarters forever!!!

All money received is going strait to production.  We are paying the sewers, washers, cutters, the people who store our denim, the fit models, the pattern adjusters...and on and on.  The more money we receive, the more jeans that we can put into production and have in stores for people to learn about and be inspired by.  We wanted to be able to earn capital without handing over more ownership interest in our brand.  It's important for us to stay to true to our values which is why we want to hold onto as much of the company as we can...

<p>Hello Indiegogo!  Thanks for checking us out!</p>
<p>What happened to your last pair of plastic sunglasses?  The odds are that they were either misplaced or thrown out. </p>
<p>In 2011, Americans generated more than 32 million tons of plastic trash.  Less than 8% was recycled.  The remaining plastic lasts forever in landfills.  That’s the best-case scenario.  Even worse is that it will break down into incredibly small components that end up in our water supply or our food.  dizm hopes to do our part and help ease our reliance on using plastic in many of our everyday products. </p>
<p><strong>dizm</strong> <strong>Eco Eyewear</strong> offers a full line of stylish, performance sunglasses with <strong>biodegradable frames</strong> to lessen the impact on our outdoor playgrounds.  As active lovers of all things outdoors and based here in Hermosa Beach, CA, we’ve created our sunglasses with design rooted in Southern California outdoor lifestyle with a look equally at home at the beach, on the boat deck or in the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Our sunglass frames are handmade with RB Cellulose Acetate that is a 100% renewable, recyclable, biodegradable and compostable plant-based material</strong>.  In contrast to our competitors who use petroleum-based materials in their frames, ours are made from renewable plant based raw materials.  With the appropriate environmental conditions, the frames will decompose into water, carbon dioxide and biomass.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>We searched the world for new materials to make sunglasses that are environmentally friendly, but do not require any sacrifice in fit, quality or design.

They are great glasses, but the handmade manufacturing process is expensive.</p>

This is a great choice for a guy. Simple, clean lines in the black and silver make a piece that can be worn every day. Girls, that doesn't mean you can't mix it up with some color and make a statement! You will have a choice of design of all silver, silver outside/ solid alternate color inside, or silver outside/ alternating color inside. See the gallery for color choices.
Hollywood Glamour Bracelet
This is a bracelet I designed for a charity auction and loved so much
 I made it part of my regular inventory. It is made using anodized 
aluminum and tiny silver beads in each of the large rings that really 
make it sparkle in the sun!
The Treasure Within necklace
This necklace is made using anodized aluminum and Swarovski pearls. 
Once I have the funds to play around a little bit with the size of 
rings, I intend to offer color choices on the aluminum as well. For now,
 it is only available in silver.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In a few short and sweet words, I'd say my project is about acceptance - loving yourself and being able to identify with what one sees on the runway! I want to make everybody feel beautiful and accepted just as they are, and not feel a need to live up to some sort of unhealthy ideal!<br/></p> <ul>
<li>My proposed fashion project is titled HEART:RAVE because I would like to create a Warhol-style fashion tribute to my two biggest style influences - Lady Gaga and David Bowie by designing looks that combine current popular music hits with current popular super heroes and villians all twisted together as if they fell through a rabbit hole illustrated by Tim Burton on Mars five years in the future! I think there are too many strict divisions in fashion, and runways don't need to be divided by height, size, age or gender, as everyone should be able to feel united through fashion! We all wear clothes, so why can't we all be a part of the same collections? Everyone should feel they are represented, whether they are 5'10"" and 120lbs or 4'5"" and 130lbs - no matter their race, whether they have religious dress requirements, piercings, tattoos, disabilities, or if they are drag queens, transsexuals, or 70 years old... basically any and all living human age 16 or over, and dogs... not cats, though - they ain't got time for that!<br/>
</li>
<li>Fashion is my passion, art is my life, and music is my inspiration. My name is Erica Rupp, and I am a 24 year old graduate of the Arts University Bournemouth with a BA(Hons) degree in Costume with Performance Design who is extremely enthusiastic about fashion!  I decided that I wanted to be an artist “when I grow up” when I was five years old; before I graduated high school I had been accepted to, and received two scholarships to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for college. I was always very interested in costumes and fashion; I have watched countless hours of movies and television from the 1940’s through present day, creating a large mental catalog of outfits and was very fascinated at how time changes  historical interpretations. I first became seriously interested in design and making in high school the first costume I fully drafted was a recreation of a David Bowie/Ziggy Stardust short, sleeveless leotard outfit with detached arm and leg sleeves when I was 16 – Bowie has been a major influence throughout! I believe what sets me apart from most emerging talent is that I draw inspiration from my experiences with music, fine art, and tattooing in my clothing designs. My goal with my personal work is to convey ideas and emotions whilst expanding visual perception by drawing inspiration from, and transforming the auditory medium of music into the visual ones of clothing and artwork. I absolutely love street and club style and have recently started creating my own print designs for textiles. I have also been working on a costume project with Miss Iowa 2013, Nikki Kelly, and now I want to expand ideas of classic beauty in fashion. <br/>

<p></p></div>","WNDRLUST College Fashion Week will consist of a fashion show and musical event in Stockton that allows students to get first hand experience in the fashion industry. Our goal is to raise $5,000 dollars to pay for production required to put on both the fashion show and the concert to conclude the day.WNDRLUST aims to  modernize online shopping in a way that connects with who we are as a generation by aggregating our favorite retail stores and providing a way to shop fashion editorial media such as lookbooks and videos with interactive shoppable technology.Why Us?Two Eberhardt School of Business students Marselus and Vanessa have teamed up to put their experience in the music and fashion industries together and put on College Fashion Week.Marselus  started his first DJ business in 2007 which would turn into Plural Music when he got to college. After finding success in Plural Music, he started The Getdowns, a concert series based out of Stockton California. He believes that culture can be stimulated through the sharing of music.Vanessa was nineteen when she started her first fashion startup for college students, a flash sale site. After two years, she watched the industry shift and foresaw new opportunities.  She took all she learned, and all the connections she made and founded WNDRLUST, the future of online shopping for millennials.What We Need To Make It HappenWe are looking to raise $5,000 to start the WNDRLUST College Fashion Week. The goal is to start a series of events centered around college students and fashion. The money will go towards producing high caliber fashion shows and music concerts on college campuses that allow students to get first hand experience in the fashion industry by submitting designs, networking with brand reps, and learning the backside of fashion show production.We hope to book one of the following artists: 
Jhene Aiko
Iamsu!
Sam Smith
Keys N' Krates
J Rabbit & TerraVita
** discalimer: the artists listed are viable options for the upcoming concert and are NOT guaranteed to be in attendance at the concert. As we finalize our show, we will have the selected listed in an official capacityThe WNDRLUST College Fashion Week aims to produce student inspired fashion shows, build and support college fashion communities, and provide students with opportunities to work alongside professionals in the fashion industry in order to get a better understanding of it.If all of the funds that we are attempting to raise do not get collected, we will still launch the WNDRLUST College Fashion week, we will just do so on a smaller scale. If our fundraising goal is exceeded we'd love to implement WNDRLUST College Fashion Week at other college campuses around the nation.Why WNDRLUST College Fashion Week?The WNDRLUST College Fashion Week is valuable in the fact that it does not just serve as a form of entertainment, it is an interactive fashion show that incorporates the thoughts, ideas, and contributions of students from different colleges. Moreover, it provides opportunities for college fashion communities to have a platform to not only showcase, but launch their designs and concepts.

The technology available today has increased access to resources that allow people to connect with the masses easily. With social media, fashion is easily shared and viewable worldwide. Recognizing this, we want to provide the stage for the college fashion community to be able to express and showcase their work in a way that has not been done before.If You Can't Contribute Financially

<p>So far we have managed to design, develop and test this
product to the sample stage and have been awarded several (expensive) patents
in countries around the world with other patents pending. Anyone who knows
anything about patents knows that this step can take years! If the concept
works and customers like you are enjoying the product, larger companies won’t
be able to legally replicate it and undo all of our hard work. This was a very
expensive and time consuming approach but one that we felt was necessary if
there is to be any future in the retail space for our summer footwear products.</p>
<p><b>Now...</b></p>
<p>We feel we have come as far as we possibly can. </p>
<p>Firstly we need to produce the molds required to be able
to create the rest of the thongs/flip flops sizes and styles.</p>
<p>Then we need to meet the minimum quantity requirements
set out by the manufacturers. They simply don’t deal in small quantities.</p>
<p>To do this we need your help to ‘pre-order’ some pairs if
you would like to try our new interchangeable range. </p>
<p>This will allow us to put that money to good use for the
production run and we can also pay for molds and other production costs as well
as patent fee’s, shipping and logistics. </p>
<p>Your 'perk' amount also includes the delivery cost if you are in Australia, USA or Canada so you will
receive the product direct to your door. </p>
<p>We intend to get our product on the shelves of
Australia’s leading retailers with a goal to have them available in the US
Market and other countries around the world.</p>
<p><b>Our team...</b> </p>
<p>Our team is made up of several key people with the skills
and expertise to make this happen. </p>
<p>If we can get the funding this will be our 4<sup>th</sup>
successful production run and without doubt will be our most innovative, fun, problem
solving and successful footwear product to date.</p>
<p>Not only have we spent our previous years doing this sort
of thing, but we have agreed to work with 1 footwear manufacturer... Led by an
Aussie that knows his flip flops and has spent the last 15 years being the
‘go-to-guy’ for some of the larger Surf brands such as Billabong, Quiksilver, Ocean
&amp; Earth and many more.</p>
<p>The quality of our product is exceptional and we already
have the systems in place to go from pre-production, molds, quality control
processes, development, shipping, warehousing and then domestic delivery direct
to your door.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/726345/files/20140718030633-the-team.jpg?1405677993"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>____________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>

<p><b>Graeme Kitchen -
Production Manager - AUS, USA &amp; CHINA (Head of Production / Footwear
Manufacturer)</b></p><p>“I have chosen to take on this project with ‘Willi
Footwear’ as I believe it has such massive potential. It is different to any
other footwear product I have developed previously and was like a
breath of fresh air when it came across my desk. From my experience in
production and retail I can see these thongs have real potential of creating a
huge impact in the market place here in Australia and overseas.”</p>

<p>“The guys from Willi Footwear have a vast knowledge of
the industry and always seem to go above expectations with
their work. I have seen the new thong range and I want this campaign to succeed
so I can eventually sell them in my retail outlets. We always appreciate their
transparency and will pursue a strong, on-going business relationship.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/725892/files/20140717202415-maxi-testimonial.jpg?1405653855"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/725894/files/20140717202506-Courtz-testimonial.jpg?1405653906"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>
</p><p><b>Changing your straps and bases is as easy as... 1...
2... 3...</b></p>
<p>Swapping your straps and bases to update your colours and
style is simple. The boomerang plugs have been designed to fit through the hole
in the thongs base, but only at a certain angle. This should prevent the plug
from pulling through at random or having the plug snap off, leaving you walking
around barefoot looking for a new pair. However, if any of the plugs do happen
to pull through (due to your idiot mate stepping on your heel, or because of
the sticky floor of your local bar), simply feed it back through as shown below
and it will be back to normal. If one of the previously mentioned scenarios
does happen, just remember... it is better for the plug to pull through than have
it snap off completely. Alternatively you can simply attach some new straps!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/715494/files/20140713232158-instructions.jpg?1405318918"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Product Materials and Features</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/715499/files/20140713233009-17.-Thongs-With-Text-Around-Them.jpg?1405319409"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>

</p><p><b>FAQ’s...</b></p>
<p><b>How do I know what size I am in Willi thongs / flip
flops?</b></p><p>
</p><p>You will find the thong
measurements in (mm) in the information above. You can measure your foot with a
ruler and choose the corresponding size. The Willi footwear sizing is based on
the US men's sizing model. As there isn’t a huge amount of difference in each size, you
will notice sizes such as the 7/8 have been merged. So if you’re a 7 or an 8
you will most likely fit comfortably in the 7/8. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p><b>I’m ordering from outside Australia... how do I add
‘international shipping’?</b></p>
<p>G’day! When ordering
outside Australia the shipping costs can differ greatly. After you have
selected your perk please then add the perk INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING COST to your
order. There are 2 international shipping cost perks. One is $20 and the other
$50. Please select the one that applies to your order as stated.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>How can I choose my size, style and colours of the
thongs/flip flops?</b></p>
<p>Easy done! We will contact
you by e-mail when the campaign ends to take your orders of size, colours and
style etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What is Willi Footwear doing with the money you raise
from this campaign?</b></p>
<p>A large portion of the
money will be spent on production molds – approximately $15,000 AUD. The actual
production costs are also quite high as we have to meet the minimum quantities
set out by the factory. This will be determined by how many orders we receive
before we go in to the production process. It might be wishful thinking, but if
there is any money left over it will be spent on establishing a base overseas
in the US market, stretch goals, more colours and styles, patent fee’s,
shipping and logistics, a new website that allows the user to customise his or
her thongs... the list is endless... unfortunately the money is not!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>When will I receive my new thongs?</b></p>
<p>The production process
SHOULD be done within a 3 month time period. That includes shipping the product
to us and then we will work as hard as we possibly can to get the individual
orders out to you. Any international orders might take a little longer.
Although if you’re in certain parts of the Northern Hemisphere you probably won’t
mind as you won’t be needing your thongs in the snow!</p>
<p>We will keep you updated
along the journey so you will know when to expect your package.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>I see that Brad Munro guy is ‘not bad’ looking... is
he single?</b></p>
<p>No... He’s got a really
hot Girlfriend that he’s marrying next year! Yay for him!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What happens if I order the incorrect size?</b></p>
<p>You idiot!!! Only joking –
it happens... Just let us know and we will do our best to swap them over for
you. You might have to incur some delivery costs but we will do everything in
our power to make sure you get our thongs on your feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What if my package gets lost in transit?</b></p>
<p>We will be so angry with
Australia Post! Although every individual package we send out will be track-able.
So just let us know if it seems like a long time since you received an e-mail saying
“your package is on its way” and it still hasn’t arrived. We will track it down
for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Do you plan to bring out more colours and designs?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! The more
colours and designs we can produce makes the whole range a lot more exciting and
customisable (is that even a word?!). The plan is to have new colours and
designs each year that can be mixed and matched with your old styles...
creating a new style!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Where can I buy this product after the campaign is
finished?</b></p>
<p>I’m glad you asked! If our
campaign is successful we will set up our new website where you will be able to

stop the common ‘blow out’ in your thongs, flip flops, sandals, jandals...
whatever you want to call them! Our new patented boomerang plugs won’t pull
through... unless you want them to, allowing the straps and bases to become interchangeable
so you really can design your own and create a number of different colour combinations. 

__________________________________________________________________________Hi Guys & Girls,
Thanks for taking the time to check out our Crowd-funding
project! Watch the short video above (if you haven’t already) and if you have
any questions, concerns, ideas or suggestions we’d love to hear from you. Contact
us by sending an e-mail to info@willi.com.auFeel free to keep up to date with news and promotions by following us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.                          info@willi.com.au    https://twitter.com/willifootwear    http://instagram.com/willifootwear/https://www.facebook.com/WilliFootwear___________________________________________________________________________Change your thong straps and thong base combination
yourself, as often as you like in less than 30 seconds... no tools, no fuss, no
more blow outs and pull-throughs... Just fashionable and comfortable footwear,
designed by you to suit your lifestyle!__________________________________________________________________________This is where we’re at...
So far we have managed to design, develop and test this
product to the sample stage and have been awarded several (expensive) patents
in countries around the world with other patents pending. Anyone who knows
anything about patents knows that this step can take years! If the concept
works and customers like you are enjoying the product, larger companies won’t
be able to legally replicate it and undo all of our hard work. This was a very
expensive and time consuming approach but one that we felt was necessary if
there is to be any future in the retail space for our summer footwear products.
Now...
We feel we have come as far as we possibly can. 
Firstly we need to produce the molds required to be able
to create the rest of the thongs/flip flops sizes and styles.
Then we need to meet the minimum quantity requirements
set out by the manufacturers. They simply don’t deal in small quantities.
To do this we need your help to ‘pre-order’ some pairs if
you would like to try our new interchangeable range. 
This will allow us to put that money to good use for the
production run and we can also pay for molds and other production costs as well
as patent fee’s, shipping and logistics. 
Your 'perk' amount also includes the delivery cost if you are in Australia, USA or Canada so you will
receive the product direct to your door. 
We intend to get our product on the shelves of
Australia’s leading retailers with a goal to have them available in the US
Market and other countries around the world.
Our team... 
Our team is made up of several key people with the skills
and expertise to make this happen. 
If we can get the funding this will be our 4th
successful production run and without doubt will be our most innovative, fun, problem
solving and successful footwear product to date.
Not only have we spent our previous years doing this sort
of thing, but we have agreed to work with 1 footwear manufacturer... Led by an
Aussie that knows his flip flops and has spent the last 15 years being the
‘go-to-guy’ for some of the larger Surf brands such as Billabong, Quiksilver, Ocean
& Earth and many more.
The quality of our product is exceptional and we already
have the systems in place to go from pre-production, molds, quality control
processes, development, shipping, warehousing and then domestic delivery direct
to your door.____________________________________________________________________________

Testimonials... Don’t just
take our word for it. These people know what they’re talking about!!!
Graeme Kitchen -
Production Manager - AUS, USA & CHINA (Head of Production / Footwear
Manufacturer)“I have chosen to take on this project with ‘Willi
Footwear’ as I believe it has such massive potential. It is different to any
other footwear product I have developed previously and was like a
breath of fresh air when it came across my desk. From my experience in
production and retail I can see these thongs have real potential of creating a
huge impact in the market place here in Australia and overseas.”
Brad Booth -
Retailer - NSW
“The guys from Willi Footwear have a vast knowledge of
the industry and always seem to go above expectations with
their work. I have seen the new thong range and I want this campaign to succeed
so I can eventually sell them in my retail outlets. We always appreciate their
transparency and will pursue a strong, on-going business relationship.____________________________________________________________________________
Changing your straps and bases is as easy as... 1...
2... 3...
Swapping your straps and bases to update your colours and
style is simple. The boomerang plugs have been designed to fit through the hole
in the thongs base, but only at a certain angle. This should prevent the plug
from pulling through at random or having the plug snap off, leaving you walking
around barefoot looking for a new pair. However, if any of the plugs do happen
to pull through (due to your idiot mate stepping on your heel, or because of
the sticky floor of your local bar), simply feed it back through as shown below
and it will be back to normal. If one of the previously mentioned scenarios
does happen, just remember... it is better for the plug to pull through than have
it snap off completely. Alternatively you can simply attach some new straps!_____________________________________________________________________________Product Materials and Features_____________________________________________________________________________

timeline of the interchangeable thongs / flip flops project so far and the projected
timeline over the next few months until the product is in your hands (or on
your feet).

through all the necessary processes and have ticked them off the list. As we
have done this before, we know we are fully capable of seeing it through and
hopefully launch our new summer footwear in to the market place!
From the end of the campaign, the production timeline
with be approximately 2-3 months dependent on smooth sailing with production,
shipping, customs etc. See the full time line below.

Feature Overview
            Coolbox in DetailBluetooth SpeakersRather than bringing an external outdoor speaker set, these marine-grade speakers are built right into your Coolbox and are designed to withstand harsh outdoor working environments. The speakers are accessible via Bluetooth, or via the auxiliary jack for any devices that do not have Bluetooth built in.  They are extremely high quality with volume capacity designed to cut through the noise of a busy job site.   USB PortsTwo USB ports are built into the front panel and charge devices even when the Coolbox is unplugged via the internal battery.     LED LightingThe rechargeable and detachable LED wand conveniently mounts inside the Coolbox to keep the work flowing when it gets dark.  It doubles as a multi angle flashlight-want when detached and is extremely powerful and versatile.  Many times external lights are hand held and difficult to balance. The light on the Coolbox allow you to use both hands while working at night, yet can be detached when needed for harder to reach spots. These lights are extremely useful in emergency and power outage situations where light is crucial but power is not available. Dual-Sided WhiteboardBe it writing a to-do list, measurements, project dimensions or anything else, the dry-erase board provides a surface for jotting down these important notes.   The whiteboard is also removable so you can leave your Coolbox behind but take your notes with you.   Internal Storage With Coolbox, you can store your tools just like any other toolbox. Fit every tool inside with the 2009 Cubic Inch capacity    Dual handlesEveryone has experienced being off balance and straining your muscles when carrying something heavy in one hand.   The Coolbox gives users the option to carry from both sides so that it can be picked up and carried using proper techniques and avoiding unnecessary muscle strains. WheelsThe Coolbox wheels are ideal for those that have difficulty carrying objects, or for the end of a project when carrying a heavy toolbox is too much to handle.    Device StandsTablets and phones are great for displaying instructions, schematics or blueprints without needing to worry about paper blowing away.   They are also great for playing music via Bluetooth connection and keeping you entertained.  Coolbox’s device stands are located on the lid and inside the box so that you can use your tablet with the Coolbox lid open or closed.   ClockRather than having to pull your phone out of your pocket, or risk damaging your watch while working, our LCD clock makes it easy to keep track of time.   The screen also displays the battery level so you can know when its time to plug the Coolbox in to top up the battery. Conveniently located next to the bottle opener... Internal BatteryThe Coolbox battery is designed to power the speakers and clock, LED light, charge devices, and will run small power tools for a short amount of time. Having portable power is extremely useful for construction workers and DIY’ers alike.  Having an internal battery ensures that the Coolbox is not another thing that draws power, but rather supplies it to users on demand. Wraparound CordHaving a warparound power cord makes the Coolbox incredibly convenient for charging and for utilizing the ""pass through"" power feature.     Rather than dragging around a tangled extension cord separately, the Coolbox power cord wraps neatly into a discrete rear storage area. 3-Way SplitterHaving a pass-through power option and 3-way splitter integrated into the Coolbox makes it handy for plugging in additional tools or small appliances when power sockets are limited or out of reach.     Connect Coolbox to an external power source or use its internal battery. Coolbox Storage Capacity   What You Can Power With Coolbox The built in battery can run all internal electronics and more, even when unplugged.

      The Idea Behind Coolbox
We really just like to build things...and have fun doing it.
Our team comes from a “hands on"" kind of background, with Mike having years of experience in the construction and mechanical industries, and myself taking apart computers and electronics only to put them back together for fun.
 

When we're not busy working 7 days on a week trying to succeed in the start up world, we also enjoy doing hobby projects around the house. These experiences inspired us to reexamine the toolbox and all of the potential it could have as an all-in-one product offering. 
We were tired of bringing speakers, phone charger, note pad, and lights with us to every job amongst other things, so that inspired the all-in-one solution.  We think it was long overdue that someone reinvented this important carrying case.
These experiences inspired us to reexamine the toolbox and update it for the 21st century and all the new gadgets that are part of the job.
 

The toolbox hasn't been update since the beginning of time. Why not build the new age toolbox for all the new tools we carry?
 
We have assembled this team so that every part of this project is done perfectly, and that our timelines can be met.  From our product designers, to our logistics and fulfillment team, all angles have been covered to deliver a flawless product.
We have all brought countless products from concept to market, and the amount of experts who have come together for the Coolbox is something we take great pride in.   We are going to deliver a product that you can’t stop bragging about.

 Built With Toughness & Quality In MindCoolbox is built to take a beating. Constructed of high impact resin,  heavy duty machined aluminum latches and handles, and an air/water tight lid seal, the Coolbox is engineered to last.
