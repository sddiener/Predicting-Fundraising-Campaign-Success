<p>GameGuard is an application that monitor's how long your children play's games on the computer and shut's the games down once the timer has reached zero.</p>
<p>This Application builds on principles of safe environments for children that play videogames and makes the child able to still use applications such as Paint, Word, Spreadsheet software and so on this means that homework is not an issue - Games will not be able to start once the timer reaches 0.</p>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>other software like this closes the computer down until the next day.</p>
<p>this does not!. This allows for your child to still develop skills with the computer, like creative software or homework, which is done more and more on the computer. It's hard for a child to focus, when computergames are in near sight.</p>
<p>this software counts down whenever a game is open, and stops the timer whenever a game is closed, so there is time for breaks and so on.</p>
<p>its important for children to have restrictions especially on computergames, aged restricted material for instance. but also on the time spent playing mindless video games. it can be hard for a parent to keep track of time and to keep an eye on the child whilst making dinner, being in the garden or grocery shopping, with gameguard, this is not a problem!</p>

<p>The idea behind this game is an instanced multiplayer turn based rpg that is focused on creating a unique story for your character while sharing achievements and dangerous missions with or against your friends.</p>
<p>The focus point is to create a character to play whilst building a legend around him or her.</p>
<p>Actions will have an effect on your journey as you play. For example, if you kill a noble, his son might hunt you down later, or perhaps you might save an old man, only to find out he can help you with a mission far later.</p>

<p><i>A schoolteacher wakes to find his entire life is missing from public record.  His bank account, his health care, his credit cards are all frozen when the government declares him to be a non-person.  As he takes the steps necessary to pull his life back together, he becomes aware of nefarious forces that have conspired against him.  The truth, it seems, is rarely pure and never simple.</i></p>
<p>Conspirocracy starts in an exaggerated, highly-bureaucratic re-imagining of Toronto, Canada.  Medical droids serve as gatekeepers between patients and doctors.  The activities of beggars and buskers are regulated and tasked.  Airport security is taken to an more extreme, disconcerting level.  As the player, you will have your work cut out for you finding what you're looking for when the system is stacked heavily against you.</p>

<p>For almost 40 years, the Foundation Fighting Blindness has funded dozens of research discoveries to identify the causes of genetic forms of blindness.  These discoveries have helped bring scientists to this very exciting time in vision research.  Today marks the first time that a treatment exists to prevent vision loss and restore some vision for those with an eye disease called 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - and the first time human trials exist to reverse blindness in certain patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).  <br/></p>
<p>To reaffirm, we live in an age where restoring sight to the blind is a real possibility!<br/></p>
<p>And what of the other half of your donation?  This project was paid for largely out of our own pockets and if we hit our target, we can safely say we've broken even.  Everything above our target will help us launch a larger and more ambitious adventure game, again for charity.  If you're wondering where exactly your money is going to go, the following reference chart will be of use.</p>

You get everything above, but instead of a background character, you will have a statue detailing your name and your accomplishments as a bureaucrat featured in-game.  The main character will read your story, as it appears on a plaque. 
 You just gave $200 to the FFB!  Thank you so much!
On behalf of our team, and of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, thank you for believing in us and our project!",16.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Kinky Island was born from the love of classic adventure games like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Monkey Island,</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Day of the Tentacle</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Flight of the Amazon Queen</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Teen Agent</span>. The game began its life as a freeware project (and just a joke) but now development is back on after continued interest in the project from fans. A demo was released in 2006 and at that time the project required new talent to help make it happen. By 2011 we had a brand new team formed and since then many of the games assets have been in production thanks to the hardwork and dedication of the team members who wanted to see the game exist. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The game is aimed at mature players who are 18+ as it features nudity, bad langauge and other adult themes !<br/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project has come a long way since 2006 - now we have all new gorgeous looking art and heaps of animation. The game features:</p>
<p>» Over 30 interactive hand-drawn rooms thanks to Micheal Cross</p>
<p>» Over 20 fully animated characters thanks to Luke Rideout</p>
<p>» Comic writing &amp; music by Mark Lovegrove</p>
<p>» Fun puzzles &amp; classic adventure gameplay thanks to James Spanos</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Screen 7</span> have been developing games for free since 1997 and working on other peoples projects. Over 2012 and the following years, we hope to finally bring Screen 7 up to commercial standard and become a proper games studio. We have plenty of projects in the pipeline that will please all fans of retro adventure games - your contribution to this project will help us deliver even more in the future!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By funding Kinky Island means this game can finally see the light of day. It also gives you the chance to pre-order and get a copy for yourself before the public. The game will usually cost around £8.99 ($14). Depending on your level of contribution, you can play the beta and even have a character based on yourself in the game. How much is currently done?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Story - 90%</p>

<p>Character art - 25%</p>
<p>Music - 10%</p>
<p>Coding - 5%</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hundreds of man-hours will have been poured into the game on completion. We thought carefully about making it free or gaining some renumeration.</p>

<h2>Turtle Stampie - the mobile game!</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Matthew and I am forunder and programmer from Cintul Apps studio. We introduce a new project named <em>Turtle Stampie</em>, is a mobile game for Android &amp; iOS platforms. You must rotate the screen by touching sides of the screen, next you must collect all of the shamans to reach next level, after 20 levels (from one of level pack) you can go to another ""pack"" of 25 levels with a different graphic! In the final version there will be a 100 levels, each of the 25 levels will be with new graphic theme and another enemies! On the video you can see an alpha 0.1 ver of Turtle Stampie. With Your help we can finish that project, publish it and go to another... but the second project is a secret now!</p>
<p>Some informations about me - I am 16 years old schoolboy living in Wroclaw, Poland. I've programming for couple of months - this game was created by me for four months. I started from ""Hello world!"" script, and <span>through these months I made Turtle Stampie</span>. Now I want to go forward, but I can't do it myself, because I do not earn any money due to my age, so I asked my dad for help in creation of this substdy campain.</p>
<p>The money, that we will get will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>buy a Development Enviroment License</li>
<li>Android Developer License</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Want to play video games, win great prizes AND do something amazing for charity? Then read on! 
1 gamer, 1 video game developer and 1 video game arcade are all working together to bring you a HUGE Dead or Alive 5 tournament in London as well as some online tournaments to win some great prizes including cash and DLC for the game itself! And have fun at a videogame arcade while you're at it!
What We Need & What You Get

On October 17th & 18th we’ll have a Dead or Alive 5 Last Round tournament here in London. It will be £20 to get into the venue for BOTH days, so you pay £20 for the Saturday and the Sunday is free. Don't forget the Heart of Gaming is a videogame arcade! You're not just playing to enter the tournament, but to play a great selection of both arcade and console games alike. Half of this money will go to the charity Human Appeal, to fund the ongoing aid work that they do. The other half will be going to support a gaming venue that is ONLY run by volunteers to pay the rent. We'll have some casual matches, and we’ll also be holding a big tournament on the day where all matches will be streamed. The tournament will be played on PS4.
Prizes so far include £200 cash, Season Passes and Digital Copies of the game!
Not got the full game? Not a problem! ANYBODY IN EUROPE with a PS4/Xbox One/PS3 will be able practice AND join in the online tournaments we'll be running as well as there is a FREE version of the game: Dead or Alive 5 Last Round Core Fighters. Players will just need to make sure to download it, buy an online tournament ticket, and practice before the day! All funds donated will go to the charity Human Appeal to fund the amazing aid work they do in Syria. But you'll need to get practicing as there will be some tough competition on the day...
To purchase a ticket for an online or offline tournament, please see the ""Perks"" section of the page. Please note payment for entry to online tournaments is separate from payment for the offline event.
When purchasing tickets for online events please leave your PSN ID or Xbox Gamertag
PLEASE NOTE: Due to DLC region lock and connection compatibility, online tournaments will only be for European players. 
   The Impact
The ongoing conflict in Syria and the recent earthquake in Nepal have left millions of people without food water and shelter. These are basic human rights that nobody should be left without. Human Appeal is a charity that seeks to help these people and we want to raise some funds so that they can carry out this work. 
Your donation will go towards helping people rebuild their lives on Syria and Nepal. These people are struggling to find food, water and shelter. With your donation, you will be able to support foreign aid workers to deliver these much needed supplies. 

Making a Donation without Entering the TournamentIf
 you dont want to play but you'd still like to donate then please feel 
free to do so on the website (just make a donation without selecting one
 of the ""Perks"")

Online Tournament Structure and Rules
We will be using the existing ""Tournament"" mode for these events. Details will be emailed to all entrants before tournaments.
Rounds: 3
Time: 60 seconds
Stage select: Random
Single Elimination (lose once and you're out!)One entry per tournament per player! (You cant buy multiple tickets for the same online tournament. Anyone found to be doing this will be disqualified WITHOUT REFUND).

If you disconnect then you're out too so make sure your Internet settings are optimised before playing ! We reserve the right to remove red bars / bad connections from the lobby!

Offline Tournament Structure and Rules
Rounds: 3
Time: 60 seconds
Stage select: Random

Offline tournament structure will depend on the number of entrants and will be confirmed when we have a better idea of numbers. If we only have a low number of entrants then it will be a ""Round Robin"" style tournament and may only last one day. If a player has paid for 2 days they will still be free to come back and play casuals/use the arcade on the 2nd day. If we have a large number of entrants, then it will be a double elimination tournament across both days. Please check back for updates!

(Quick Time Event) among others, to drive you totally insane!   Flush those evil creatures before they escape or someone discovers you!Now, with the mastering of your skills, unlock every playable level, buy every weapon and item to make your task easier, but the most important is:Don’t forget to flush!!! - Attack those little demons with plungers, brooms and even with toothbrushes when there aren’t better weapons around.- Block its karate chops at the precise moment to be rewarded, on the contrary, you will be knocked out for a little while, leaving you vulnerable to other attacks.- Destroy its disgusting flying projectiles before they reach you, dodge its armed attacks and blow away its terrible farts with the hair dryer before you die suffocated.- Each one of these twisted enemies have special skills depending on what you have eaten before facing them.- Also, you will count on help from a little character, who will supply you the necessary accessories to combat evil and many other features that will give you a guaranteed amusement!                                              Some features of this exciting and naughty video game are: - 12 frenetic main levels with different enemies each and some bonus levels!- 5 different weapons to make those poops wish they never came out!- An in-game store with 8 items to make the cleaning easier!- An almost total destructible environment (A perfect catharsis!)- An “I want to bloody know how it continues” story!- Hilarious in-game moments and cutscenes!- A lot of replayability, to repeat your favorite dishes!And a lot more!!! It is expected to be released, and those nasty creatures unleashed, at the beginning of 2018!Let’s hope the dev won’t be sleeping under a bridge by then...                      At this stage all the development costs, were made by the dev with very much effort and now the project is running out of resources (And the dev isn’t teaching on vacations from January to April, so this is the only chance to survive now).What is needed to make this happen? USD 9.500- To reach the end of the production of the twelve original levels, in-game store, remaining characters and game mechanics.- Service of voice acting for the remaining dialogues and characters.- Equalization of the soundtrack.- Game Post Production (Models, animations, texture, shaders, programming, gameplay polishing and and so on).- TestingThere are a lot ideas in my head. Help me make them come true! USD 15.000- Addition of different bonus levels to add more content and refresh the playability in different locations.- Addition of more enemies and game mechanics!      $3Mwah!!The goal is three dollar closer. The poops are going to kiss you, a lot!! $7Lots of fun on Steam! A digital version of the game on Steam once released + exclusive signed wallpaper (Full HD) to get your desktop dirty!           $15They are everywhere!A digital version of the game on Steam once released! + Making Off e-book     $25Fun everywhere!A digital version of the game on Steam + digital soundtrack     $50Mr. Contributor!A digital version of the game on Steam + name on credits    $100The Contributonator!A digital version of the game on Steam + digital soundtrack + making off e-book + name on credits as top contributor            $300You are in the game!A digital version of the game on Steam + your picture inside the game for a couple seconds in a cutscene! + name on credits.   $500Poops salute you!A digital version of the game on Steam + name on credits + a customized audio message for you, from the poops!    $1,000You are in the game, permanently!A digital version on Steam + your picture inside the game (In the Rat Store), permanently! + name on the credits as top contributor.(There are only 2 slots available, and the first contributor will get the biggest one)     $5,000Be the envy of your constipated friends!A digital version of the game on Steam  + digital soundtrack + making off ebook + name on credits as top contributor + a customized picture of you photomontage beating down those evil poops as a wallpaper!      Do you imagine  a 4 years-old boy with withdrawal syndrome for not being allowed to play Atari?. Well, that’s me! Since I was a little child I had video games, drawing, comics, music and animation movies addiction. I preferred to draw comics and design characters to pay attention to class at schooland of course, it was much more motivating to let my mind blows, than being sat at my desk within a suffocating classroom. I always knew that I wanted to dedicate myself to these kinds of artistic areas, because they fill my heart completely.When I got older I worked hard at a boring book store, to get money for affording my Digital Animation studies.Lately, as I’m  a self-taught person, l learned by myself about musical composition software, illustration software and video editing software among others, until I learned about video games.Besides, I’ve been teaching Digital Animation and Video Games Design during 8 years so far and I undertook “Sumersion Studio” business venture with two other partners. Finally, I’ve decided to follow my own path as a solo dev, because I have all the skills and tools to do it. I think that sometimes, it’s better to keep the unique personal vision and doing things as one has planned, more than making deals with others for making them happy. It’s been a long and a difficult path with ups and downs, with gratifications and disappointments,  but even like that, all I’ve been passing through motivates me. The fact of knowing I will be able to create and bring my ideas to reality, sharing them with others, giving them a good moment and leave them a positive message, helps me to wake me up happily.                                                                  - What happens if the campaign doesn’t reach the goal?The game will be released anyway, probably with fewer features than  the originally designed. - Why is a poop?A poop is a taboo in many different cultures, but it is something as natural as breathing.I think we should start laughing more at these  subjects and worrying less about shallow things.Besides, having a good time it’s not the only game goal, but, it also makes people think about their eating habits . - How many gameplay hours?It depends on your gaming skills, but the average I guess it  would be two hours. If you are one handed person, probably six. (Just kidding…)It would be more…- Are you crazy?For being an indie, for being a teacher or for developing a game about poop? - Where can I get ARKADIANAX?This game is unavailable right now, but a remake is on its way! Link to Youtube Video(And I guess there is an old torrent with the unfinished game) - Why Indiegogo?Because I’ve seen great projects raised (And I’ve donated lot of them too), and I’m surethis great community will help me now. We, people, have the responsibility to help each other and I hope this is not the exception! :D - Will this be for mobile?It’s  an option, it depends on all this. We will see… For more questions about this, please, leave a commentary. Thanks for your time, guys! www.ascenddigitally.comhttps://www.facebook.com/AscendDigitallyhttps://twitter.com/anhojman",64.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Class</h3>
<p>Do you have a burning desire to create video games?</p>
<p>In this class you'll learn how to create working games in the web browser using JavaScript and HTML5.  This is a course for game programmers, but we'll cover more than just programming.  You'll learn how to gather together graphics and sounds and use your code to bring them to life.  You'll learn how to tell a story, and how to add all the little details that make the difference between a graphics demo and an actual game.  Best of all, you can share your finished games immediately with the whole world on the class website or on your own website.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>If funded, the class will run from June 3 through July 8.  Each day I'll post new content online including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working demonstration code illustrating new concepts</li>
<li>Sample game code</li>
<li>Video explanations of key topics</li>
<li>Interactive online coding challenges</li>
<li>New tasks and dares for students</li>
<li>Feedback on student submitted tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>All content will be posted on the class website.  You'll be given accounts on the server to post your own demos and games, and a version control repository to keep track of your source code (you are not required to use it if you don't want to).  The class website will also have a forum section for discussions related to the class.  You will be able to post your task results in the forum or email them directly to me for feedback.</p>
<p><span>All the pledge levels from Student on up give you access forever to all the educational content of the class whenever you want it, whenever you have time for it.  I'll never take down the class content.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Prerequisites</span></h3>
<p>Students should have some existing programming knowledge, but don't need to be JavaScript experts.  To be successful in the class, you should have the following skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some experience programming (for example in Python, Java, C#, or JavaScript)</li>
<li>Able to edit text files</li>
<li>Familiarity with basic HTML markup</li>
<li>Ability to use a graphics program such as Photoshop or the GIMP to cut, crop, and do other basic operations on images</li>
<li>Willingness to learn new technologies and programming techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus of the class is on creating games, not crazy programming techniques.  We'll be using programming as a tool to help us create games.</p>
<p>If you're not sure that your programming skills are good enough, try this practice problem.  In your favorite programming language, write a function that returns the sum of all the positive numbers in an array.  If the input is the array [1, 3, -5, 10] then the result from your function should be 14.  If you can write a solution in a few minutes without any problems then your programming skills are good enough for the class.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>The class will cover making browser-based games using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas. We'll be using a bunch of JavaScript libraries to make our lives easier, including the <a href=""http://craftyjs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Crafty"">Crafty</a> game engine.  The finished games should work in any modern web browser.</p>
<h3>Funding Breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>$300 commissioned professional graphics for top game design proposals (will be CC-BY-3.0 licensed)</li>
<li>$178 royalty-free music licensing service (two months)</li>
<li>$60 server hosting for webpages and source code repositories (two months)</li>
<li>$50 miscellaneous royalty-free music</li>
<li>$40 email service for discussion group emails (two months)</li>
<li>$51 Indiegogo and Paypal fees</li>
<li>$30 video hosting for instructional videos (two months)</li>
<li>$20 royalty-free game sound effects sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $729</p>
<p>One expense is commissioning professional graphics for the top game design proposal(s). I want this to be a part of the class to show students how it works and what the costs are like. Of course most of the graphics we will use will be Creative Commons graphics gathered from many sources throughout the web. For music, I plan to use Magnatune's ILicenseMusic service and iStockphoto (they also have music) in addition to my existing collection of appropriately licensed Creative Commons works.</p>
<p>If the funding goal isn't met I will not be able to conduct the class.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I've always been interested in creating my own video games ever since I could understand anything. Working to create my own games as a kid led me down the programming path that I'm still on today.</p>
<p>In college I studied math and physics because I love figuring out how things work and discovering hidden beauty. At the time I saw programming as a means to an end, a way of getting things working, not really interesting in its own right. Then I discovered functional programming. I fell in love with programming all over again and realized that computer science is full of hidden wonders just as much as mathematics. I ended up getting a PhD in computer science at the University of California--Santa Cruz. After I finished my degree I joined the world of professional software development.</p>
<p>As a graduate student I've helped teach many classes in mathematics and computer science. Far and away the most fun class I've ever taught has been the UCSC COSMOS Game Programming summer school. High school students came for a few months in the summer to learn about game design and game programming. I was amazed at the creativity and drive of the students and at what they were able to accomplish.</p>
<p>I want to recreate the excitement of that class but in an internet class. I'm a believer in the power of online classes. Online classes can be cheaper and reach many more people simultaneously. I've done a few experimental classes before. It's actually pretty amazing. Hundreds of thousands of visitors have seen my ""Nathan's Lessons"" short interactive tutorial on JavaScript closures. That's more students than I ever saw in a classroom through years of being a graduate student. I got thousands of students for my class ""Create Your Own Programming Language"". Students learned esoteric programming language theory to be able to create their own programming languages.</p>
<p>I want this class to succeed because I want to bring the excitement of game programming to more students and get more games created. With just a little bit of guidance and direction, I know that beginning game programmers are capable of amazing things.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">How to Help</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even if you don't have time to take the class yourself you are encouraged to pledge at any level you can afford. Every contribution helps make the class possible. Because this is an all online class, you can never take away a spot from another student. There is always room for more students in a digital class!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to the campaign you can still be involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help get the word out to your friends that are interested in game programming</li>
<li>After the class is over, play the finished games and promote your favorite game</li>
</ul>
<h3>NEW: Free Student Waiting List</h3>
<p>I've gotten inquiries from students throughout the world in a variety of situations who would like to participate in the class but are unable to financially contribute. To help bring the class to as many deserving students as possible I've started up a waiting list for students to take the class for free.</p>
<p>If you pledge at the new ""StudentPlus"" level you get to be a student in the class with all the benefits that entails, plus you allow one student on the waiting list to take the class as well.</p>

<p><a href=""http://FrolicTribute.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FrolicTribute.com</a> is a website thats purpose is to enrich the lives of internet users. The site will provide many things including watching funny/trending videos, playing games with other users or by yourself. Later, after our basic model is working we plan to expand into areas such as music, art, and anything we feel that we can effectively help or support. How are we going to do it? Keep reading and we promise our concept will become clear!</p>
<p><strong>Whats the money for-</strong></p>
<p>We will be using Magento to run our site. Magento is a eCommerce platform that is much more sophisticated then the typical html, css, java sites. Providing an effectively more secure and elegant website. We need additional funding for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting</li>
<li>Extensions(functions)</li>
<li>Programmers(We need additional people for certain functions)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Videos -</strong></p>
<p>This is nothing new, our site will offer funny trending videos with a splash of our own humor. This has been done time and again but our site its trying to bring multiple sources of entertainment into one centralize location. Also the internet is becoming more and more effected by viruses and spyware, understanding this concern we will be trying to run a site that the user doesn't have to be wondering if its safe to visit or not.</p>
<p><strong>Games -</strong></p>
<p>Honestly the possibilities for what games to support is limitless. We plan to target the biggest and most played games especially ones we feel users want. Starting off <a href=""http://FrolicTribute.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FrolicTribute.com</a> will be supporting PC games but in the background working on adding other systems that way users are not limited to what they can play.</p>
<p><strong>Tournaments -</strong></p>
<p>The tournaments run through our site will be completely inside our own system. Each member/user will receive a rating promptly after playing a few matches. The tournaments will be sectioned off so someone that is one of the best cannot play against someone that is just ok or new to the game. Each tournament will earn the users prizes ranging from tokens, entry into bigger tournaments, or actual items such as $20 gift card. Hopefully as the site grows we can award big items such as electronics.</p>
<p><strong>Rating -</strong></p>
<p>With our rating system it will be a numeric value so essentially there are thousands of places the user could be ranked. We feel that this will create a better gaming experience. For example, in Dota 2 there are only 3 ranks supporting millions of users, or in CS:GO there is only 16. When playing these games you have no idea where you stand, you just keep playing until you rank up. <a href=""http://FrolicTribute.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FrolicTribute.com</a> plans to fix this frustration!</p>
<p><strong>Tribute Tokens -</strong></p>
<p>Each user/member obtains tokens on our site which is used as valueless currency. Tokens can be used for things such as entering tournaments, buying items such as a gift card or tv, or put them back into the site supporting projects and upgradable features to enhance your experience.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I get Tribute Tokens -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Signing Up</li>
<li>Referals</li>
<li>Watch Videos</li>
<li>Play Games</li>
<li>Being Active on the Site</li>
<li>Winning Tournaments</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>And much much more!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Growth -</strong></p>
<p>Right now we feel like there is a clear way to help the video and gaming communities. We are currently looking at music amongst other areas. When the video and gaming portion proves itself we will try to tap other areas and ask for our members input to help decide where to go. If for some reason we fail at one area we can move to the next only expanding to areas that we successfully better.</p>

<p><em><strong>Thanks for taking a interest in our project, we hope it has intrigued you and even if you don't donate we appreciate your time all the same.</strong></em></p></div>","What is FrolicTribute.com?
FrolicTribute.com is a website thats purpose is to enrich the lives of internet users. The site will provide many things including watching funny/trending videos, playing games with other users or by yourself. Later, after our basic model is working we plan to expand into areas such as music, art, and anything we feel that we can effectively help or support. How are we going to do it? Keep reading and we promise our concept will become clear!
Whats the money for-
We will be using Magento to run our site. Magento is a eCommerce platform that is much more sophisticated then the typical html, css, java sites. Providing an effectively more secure and elegant website. We need additional funding for the following:

Hosting
Extensions(functions)
Programmers(We need additional people for certain functions)
Videos -
This is nothing new, our site will offer funny trending videos with a splash of our own humor. This has been done time and again but our site its trying to bring multiple sources of entertainment into one centralize location. Also the internet is becoming more and more effected by viruses and spyware, understanding this concern we will be trying to run a site that the user doesn't have to be wondering if its safe to visit or not.
Games -
Honestly the possibilities for what games to support is limitless. We plan to target the biggest and most played games especially ones we feel users want. Starting off FrolicTribute.com will be supporting PC games but in the background working on adding other systems that way users are not limited to what they can play.
Tournaments -
The tournaments run through our site will be completely inside our own system. Each member/user will receive a rating promptly after playing a few matches. The tournaments will be sectioned off so someone that is one of the best cannot play against someone that is just ok or new to the game. Each tournament will earn the users prizes ranging from tokens, entry into bigger tournaments, or actual items such as $20 gift card. Hopefully as the site grows we can award big items such as electronics.
Rating -
With our rating system it will be a numeric value so essentially there are thousands of places the user could be ranked. We feel that this will create a better gaming experience. For example, in Dota 2 there are only 3 ranks supporting millions of users, or in CS:GO there is only 16. When playing these games you have no idea where you stand, you just keep playing until you rank up. FrolicTribute.com plans to fix this frustration!
Tribute Tokens -
Each user/member obtains tokens on our site which is used as valueless currency. Tokens can be used for things such as entering tournaments, buying items such as a gift card or tv, or put them back into the site supporting projects and upgradable features to enhance your experience.
How Do I get Tribute Tokens -

Signing Up
Referals
Watch Videos
Play Games
Being Active on the Site
Winning Tournaments

And much much more!
Growth -
Right now we feel like there is a clear way to help the video and gaming communities. We are currently looking at music amongst other areas. When the video and gaming portion proves itself we will try to tap other areas and ask for our members input to help decide where to go. If for some reason we fail at one area we can move to the next only expanding to areas that we successfully better.

Get all your emails, texts and notifications from Android in Linux, access all your files from both Android and Linux and so much more!By using an Open source ROM a growing community will easily be able to port this to more devices, allowing for many 'unofficial' builds for a huge support base.LinuxonAndroid already supports 8 different distributions, and in time we hope to support stable versions of all of these all tightly integrated with Android, just pick your favourite distribution and away you go! We will start with Ubuntu as the first officially supported distro but plan to quickly move to support Debian, Kali Linux, Fedora, ArchLinux and many more. These will come with a base of software including web browser, office and email clients with other modifications required to 'talk' to Android and access the file system, notifications etc. All the changes will be open source and available from our git and repositories. Below a break down of our funding goals, any money raised will go towards the project and pushing it to its goal, but we believe at these funding points we can archive these goals. Its also important to note that while we will only be officially supporting the below devices all the work will be open source so developers will be able to port to other devices in the future! £1500 - Open Source ROM as described above with Nexus 4 support, Ubuntu at launch with full integration (working audio, native video, shared file system, notification/email/text pass through)£2000 - All of the above, plus support for the Sony Xperia Tablet Z and full documentation at launch to make it much easier for other developers to port the project to other devices£3000 - All of the Above plus Nexus 5 support£5000 - All of the Above plus Nexus 7 (both 2012/13) and Nexus 10 supportLinuxonAndroid has been running for just over two years, and we have grown from strength to strength. From our simple beginnings of a guide on XDA the project has grown and grown, we currently stand at around 60,000 active installs of our app (Complete Linux Installer), get about 25,000 weekly downloads of our Linux images on source forge and now support 8 different Linux distributions. We have grown so much but its now time to take it to a new level with successful funding LinuxonAndroid will evolve into something truly useful, something that makes your Android device in to far more, into a full computer. And this is where we need YOU, we have the ideas, we have the skills we just do not have the funding or the free time. Only you can help here, by funding the project and helping us reach our goals we can guarantee dedicated time on the project to meet and smash our goals.As an added intensive to the project we have set up the current perks, with more perks possibly being added at a later date. Donate just £2 and you will be sent a donation key that will unlock all the extra features in the current app, donate £10 and you will be one of the first to get early access to the next version!Donate £40 and we will send you a nice little swag bag plus a donation key AND early access to the next version.Not everyone can contribute with money, we completely understand this as it is after all the holiday period, but there are plenty of ways you can help support the project!If you already have a root Android device why not download our app now and try out the current project app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zpwebsites.linuxonandroidAnd do not forget to make some noise about this funding, share to all your social network sites and get the word out!In the news:

<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Blackpowder &amp; Bloodlines is being run by Immersive Arts Melbourne - a group of experienced LARP writers and players who’ve participated in games all over Melbourne and around the world. We’re bringing our unique approach back to run the best game we can - and we need your help!</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>The campaign focuses on the interaction between Old World humans and New World orcs, their mutual struggle to survive, and the development of a new society. Humans from four nations as well as the orcs are available for player characters, all richly filled out with their own unique but recognisable cultures.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span>Our streamlined rules get out of the way and let players</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span> engage in deep role-playing, with resources tracked by in-game tokens and some brutal but forgiving combat mechanics. </span>Much of the game experience will result from emergent play driven by the search for resources, and their use. Success, story and survival will all depend on competition for these scarce resources.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The game itself is spread out over several different play spaces, both physically and conceptually, to allow players to pick and choose what parts they participate in. While each play space affects the others, it’s perfectly possible for a player to just do one thing they enjoy all event. Better still, players can work with friends to have an impact everywhere - and true power awaits whoever can best shepherd their assets.</span></p>
<p><span>Our goal is to create a campaign of at least five weekend events, for over a hundred players which engages and inspires everyone involved, creates an environment of real challenge, and leaves a lasting impression full of fond memories. </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We’re more than happy to do all the writing &amp; testing on our own time: it’s fun, we love it and we’ll keep doing it as long as we can. But, we’re going big this time and some of this exciting stuff costs money. We’re asking for $6000 to help cover the major setup costs to help us get everything moving:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Insurance &amp; Administration: $1000.</b> This is our first hurdle. We can’t run without it, most sites need us to have it before they’ll even take a booking.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Site fees: $1250. </b>If our game is going to be immersive, the choice of site is critical. We’re looking for a site that meets our atmospheric needs, as well as being able to support the hundred-plus people who’ll actually be at the event, so having some coin in the pocket will help us find the perfect place.</p></li>
<li><p><b>NPC costumes, weapons, gear: $2000. </b>We have some big ideas, and for that we’ll need a big crew. NPCs are the key to developing really cool play experiences, and we want them to be awesome.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Props &amp; set-pieces: $1000. </b>We can make do with posterboard and string, but we’d prefer to do some really special stuff to bring the world to life. With your help, we can make it happen.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Website &amp; photography: $400. </b>The photography that comes out of LARP events is amazing, and it really helps to get people to events. We think this deserves proper recompense, and we’re tired of paying for it in booze and pizza.</p></li>
<li><p><b>GM Supplies, radios, first aid kits: $250.</b> Making sure our Game Masters are properly-stocked, able to coordinate and look after everyone is a priority.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Storage &amp; transport fees: $100.</b> It’s not sexy, but we’ve got to put all our props somewhere.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t make our goal, we’ll still be running the game - even if we have to build stuff out of duct tape and cardboard!</p>

<p><span>Immersive Arts looking to build on the excellent LARP community that already exists in Melbourne and take it to the next level in every aspect: in immersion, in intensity, in maturity and in ambition. We fully expect that Blackpowder &amp; Bloodlines will have an ongoing positive effect on the community at large, since we’ve seen it before - each time a club makes something amazing happen, the benefits filter out everywhere else. We hope that we can capture that magic too, and help the entire hobby take the next step up.</span></p>
<p>When we write &amp; run LARP events, we don’t throw things together. We design them from the ground up with specific goals in mind. For Zeppelin Games, we wanted to ask “Can LARP be art?”; for Murder on the Ghan, we wanted to see what happens if players can’t trust the GMs; for Blackpowder &amp; Bloodlines, we have several major goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We want to give our players a wide scope of play options.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to create mature, theme-exploring play.</p></li>
<li><p>We want our players to intensely immerse themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to present serious moral choices with high personal stakes.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to help our players grow and improve in the hobby.</p></li>
</ul>We’ve seen &amp; done all of these before to varying degrees of scale and effectiveness and the results can be truly amazing.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p><img alt=""Jay"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.blackknightgames.ca/images/Online%20Images/staff-profile-jay-old%20sm.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>I'm Jay, the owner of Black Knight Games in Hamilton, ON.  Since opening our doors almost six years ago Black Knight Games has been proud to be Hamilton's premier store for miniature wargaming, CCGs, RPGs and board games.  In that time we have grown considerably, and the Black Knight Games community has expanded with us creating a large group of local gamers that I am proud to be a part of.</p>
<p>The only down side to any of this is that we are simply running out of room!  It is not uncommon for a gamer to show up hoping for a game with a buddy only to find the space completely filled with participants of a league or tournament.</p>
<p>Until recently there wasn't anything that we could do about that, but now there is.  We have reached an agreement with our landlords and will be moving soon to a larger space in the same plaza.  We will be committing a lot of the new space to an amazing new gaming space which we are calling <strong>The Stronghold Game Lounge!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>But We Need You!</h3>
<p>We have already secured enough funds to get the space and move, and even add some improvements, but as it is we will have a large area which will almost double the amount of gaming space we have, but it will really just be a room similar to what we have now...and where's the fun in that?</p>
<p>With your help we can turn this simple space in to a gaming lair that you will love, and want to spend all your time in!  So, we have created this funding campaign to allow you, the local Black Knight gamer, to pitch in and turn this in to the game room of your dreams.</p>
<p>We're not just asking for a donation, that's not what this is at all.  We are creating a fundraising campaign that will allow you to get all sorts of great perks which simultaneously helping us make our community an amazing club-space.  Please Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are already committed to providing our gamers with the the best area that we can.  Any funds from this campaign will only be used to add to the greatness which will be this lounge.</li>
<li>This campaign will reward all donors with perks based on the amount they have pitched in.  These perks are along the right, and are guaranteed rewards for donors.  So you get cool stuff AND the chance to pitch in!</li>
<li>We will also have stretch-goals based on how much has been raised.  The more money we can raise the more goodies will be unlocked for the new space!</li>
</ol>
<p>This funding campaign is not only a great way for you to pitch in financially, we will also make it a place for you to have a voice.  Do you have a great idea for a perk or stretch goal?  Do you know the one thing that will take this gaming space from good to great?  Well it's not too late, leave comments and create a conversation!  We would love to hear from you, because it is absolutely your space that we are making here!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What will the New Game Room Be Used For?</h3>
<p>The Stronghold Game Lounge will replace our current gaming area, and will:</p>
<p>Allow us to run more events, and allow us to run some huge events, like a Magic: the Gathering Grand Prix Trial with 70+ players, or a 30 Team (60 player) Warhammer 40K Doubles Tournament!  It will allow us to run events for more niche games that usually are usually pre-empted by events from the bigger systems.  Expect more opportunity for games like Malifaux, Dystopian Wars, RPGs, Infinity, Flames of War, World of Warcraft TCG, Pokemom, and Blood Bowl...We play so many great games at BKG, and now we can let them all shine.</p>
<p>Event when we have an event on we will usually have plenty of extra space for you to get a pick-up game with your buddy, or even just to hang out with other gamers.</p>
<p><img alt=""Stronghold Member Card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.blackknightgames.ca/images/Online%20Images/Stronghold%20Membership.JPG"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Who gets to use the Stronghold Game Lounge?</p>
<p>There are several ways that you can gain access to the Stronghold Game Lounge.  First of all every Stronghold Member will have access all the time.  Any participants in an official tournament or designated event will get access for the day as well.  Finaly you can gain access with a day-pass, or as the guest of a Red Card Member.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Look we've all been there, sometimes you just don't have the extra cash to throw at something you want, even something as cool as this.  But fear not, there are plenty of things you can do to help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends!, and family!</li>
<li>Post this campaign to Facebook, Twitter or other social media.</li>
<li>Follow the funding campaign and pitch in with ideas and opinions.</li>
<li>Offer up your labor or skills!  We have a TON of work to do to get our to our vision, and anybody wishing to vonlunteer is more than welcome!</li>
</ul>
<h3>But I Don't Have a Credit Card or Paypal!</h3>
<p>Really?  Dude it's 2013!  Don't worry, if you would prefer to contribute we can definitely work something out.  Drop by the store and let the staff know, or <strong><a href=""mailto:info@blackknightgames.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">email us</a></strong>!</p>
<p> </p>

<div align=""center"">
<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://blackknightgames.ca/images/Online%20Images/Kickstarter/Stretch%20Goals.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
</div>
<p>While we will be thrilled with any donations we get, the more we end up with the more great stuff we will be able to add to the space.  If we reach our normal goal you will have helped us out enough to make the space a reality, and to add to and update our tables.</p>
<p>That being said, we have all kinds of great ideas that would really make the Stronghold Game Lounge amazing.  So, if we make our initial $1000 goal we will then switch over to focussing on Stretch Goals.  As we knock-out stretch goals we will continually add more and more to the space until we finaly have the Gamer's Paradise of all our dreams!</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals will include things like:<br/></strong>A lounge Area to rest in, Premium Tables, new items on the menu like hot drinks and food, fun entertainment like an X-Box or Foosball table, amazing decor including great art and a medieval-village facade, and interconnected TVs.  We also have two major goals, which will take some effort: <strong>A fully licensed bar</strong> to allow us to run After-Hours Veteran's Nights, and an additional private gaming area to add even more gaming, and options called <strong>The Keep Game Room</strong>.  Also some stretch goals will even <strong>upgrade the perks</strong> you've earned, meaning you get even more stuff for your contribution!</p>

</div></div>","Hello!
I'm Jay, the owner of Black Knight Games in Hamilton, ON.  Since opening our doors almost six years ago Black Knight Games has been proud to be Hamilton's premier store for miniature wargaming, CCGs, RPGs and board games.  In that time we have grown considerably, and the Black Knight Games community has expanded with us creating a large group of local gamers that I am proud to be a part of.
The only down side to any of this is that we are simply running out of room!  It is not uncommon for a gamer to show up hoping for a game with a buddy only to find the space completely filled with participants of a league or tournament.
Until recently there wasn't anything that we could do about that, but now there is.  We have reached an agreement with our landlords and will be moving soon to a larger space in the same plaza.  We will be committing a lot of the new space to an amazing new gaming space which we are calling The Stronghold Game Lounge!


But We Need You!
We have already secured enough funds to get the space and move, and even add some improvements, but as it is we will have a large area which will almost double the amount of gaming space we have, but it will really just be a room similar to what we have now...and where's the fun in that?
With your help we can turn this simple space in to a gaming lair that you will love, and want to spend all your time in!  So, we have created this funding campaign to allow you, the local Black Knight gamer, to pitch in and turn this in to the game room of your dreams.
We're not just asking for a donation, that's not what this is at all.  We are creating a fundraising campaign that will allow you to get all sorts of great perks which simultaneously helping us make our community an amazing club-space.  Please Note:

We are already committed to providing our gamers with the the best area that we can.  Any funds from this campaign will only be used to add to the greatness which will be this lounge.
This campaign will reward all donors with perks based on the amount they have pitched in.  These perks are along the right, and are guaranteed rewards for donors.  So you get cool stuff AND the chance to pitch in!
We will also have stretch-goals based on how much has been raised.  The more money we can raise the more goodies will be unlocked for the new space!

This funding campaign is not only a great way for you to pitch in financially, we will also make it a place for you to have a voice.  Do you have a great idea for a perk or stretch goal?  Do you know the one thing that will take this gaming space from good to great?  Well it's not too late, leave comments and create a conversation!  We would love to hear from you, because it is absolutely your space that we are making here!


What will the New Game Room Be Used For?
The Stronghold Game Lounge will replace our current gaming area, and will:
Allow us to run more events, and allow us to run some huge events, like a Magic: the Gathering Grand Prix Trial with 70+ players, or a 30 Team (60 player) Warhammer 40K Doubles Tournament!  It will allow us to run events for more niche games that usually are usually pre-empted by events from the bigger systems.  Expect more opportunity for games like Malifaux, Dystopian Wars, RPGs, Infinity, Flames of War, World of Warcraft TCG, Pokemom, and Blood Bowl...We play so many great games at BKG, and now we can let them all shine.
Event when we have an event on we will usually have plenty of extra space for you to get a pick-up game with your buddy, or even just to hang out with other gamers.
Who gets to use the Stronghold Game Lounge?
There are several ways that you can gain access to the Stronghold Game Lounge.  First of all every Stronghold Member will have access all the time.  Any participants in an official tournament or designated event will get access for the day as well.  Finaly you can gain access with a day-pass, or as the guest of a Red Card Member.


Other Ways You Can Help
Look we've all been there, sometimes you just don't have the extra cash to throw at something you want, even something as cool as this.  But fear not, there are plenty of things you can do to help!

Tell your friends!, and family!
Post this campaign to Facebook, Twitter or other social media.
Follow the funding campaign and pitch in with ideas and opinions.
Offer up your labor or skills!  We have a TON of work to do to get our to our vision, and anybody wishing to vonlunteer is more than welcome!

But I Don't Have a Credit Card or Paypal!
Really?  Dude it's 2013!  Don't worry, if you would prefer to contribute we can definitely work something out.  Drop by the store and let the staff know, or email us!
 




While we will be thrilled with any donations we get, the more we end up with the more great stuff we will be able to add to the space.  If we reach our normal goal you will have helped us out enough to make the space a reality, and to add to and update our tables.
That being said, we have all kinds of great ideas that would really make the Stronghold Game Lounge amazing.  So, if we make our initial $1000 goal we will then switch over to focussing on Stretch Goals.  As we knock-out stretch goals we will continually add more and more to the space until we finaly have the Gamer's Paradise of all our dreams!
Stretch Goals will include things like:A lounge Area to rest in, Premium Tables, new items on the menu like hot drinks and food, fun entertainment like an X-Box or Foosball table, amazing decor including great art and a medieval-village facade, and interconnected TVs.  We also have two major goals, which will take some effort: A fully licensed bar to allow us to run After-Hours Veteran's Nights, and an additional private gaming area to add even more gaming, and options called The Keep Game Room.  Also some stretch goals will even upgrade the perks you've earned, meaning you get even more stuff for your contribution!









In addition to claiming perks donors may add additional funds and claim Add-Ons.  These add-ons are only available to donors that have already claimed a normal perk.  Some add-ons have added restrictions: The Red Card upgrade may only be added to a perk that includes the normal Stronghold Membership,  The additional Founder's Party ticket may only be added to a perk that already includes the pair of Founder's Party tickets.
To add an add-on simply increase your pledge by the number indicated.  At the end of the campaign we will find out through surveys which of the add-ons you wanted.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>Hello from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, headquarters of Game Scorpion Inc. which is a small Indie app and game development company.  We are a 3 person team consisting of myself (Abhinav Gupta - Lead Developer and CEO), my wife Seema Gupta and our other developer Amit Niraj in India.  <br/><br/>Since I was a little boy I've always been in love with playing video games and making them.  My first game that gave me the passion to create was a game called Nibbles made in QBasic.  For the first time I was able to take a game and edit levels and make my own version of the game.  For the first time I got a taste of the world of developing and soon fell in love with video game development.<br/><br/>Now many years later my team mates and I have been making games and apps for iOS, Android and various other platforms.  This is the first time we are going to be trying out the Indiegogo platform and crowd funding to help us in creating our new game title PENTORA VAGEN.  <br/><br/>You can read about my history in my personal page.  I have had a very challenging time, but I guess that's how the best stories are created right? </p>
<p>I've lost my job, my house, my car, and nearly everything I had in the recession. After a large loss like that, having FAITH in a greater power is a very important thing.  I can honestly say that without God and keeping faith we would not have been able to even get this far.</p>
That being said, we are now HOPING and having FAITH that many of you reading this and viewing this project will help us fund this great vision for this game so that we may continue to do what we love and hopefully build a larger company that helps to create jobs and keep families in their homes!<br/><p>Giving back to the community and helping out the economy is a lesson that we have learnt after loosing so much ourselves. We hope to one day become the next large company hiring thousands, but until then we will keep growing and working hard towards building a winning and responsible company!</p>
<p>DREAMS COME TRUE, please help us in making this vision a reality!<br/><br/>Thank you once again for your support, from the bottom of our hearts we would not be able to do this without you!<br/><br/>God Bless!<br/><br/>Abhinav Gupta<br/>Lead Developer and CEO<br/>Game Scorpion Inc.<br/><a href=""http://www.gamescorpion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gamescorpion.com</a></p>
<h3>WHAT IS THIS?</h3>
<p>Pentora Vagen is the name of the game.  We took several game concepts that we found highly addictive and built an entire world around it.  The closest way we can describe it is like taking a trading/buying/selling game and mixing it with an RPG!</p>
<p>You are a merchant known as a Vagen who must go around in this 2D/3D (Possibly 2.5D) world known as Pentora. As a Vagen (Merchant Class) you will travel to various kingdoms to buy and sell your various goods. </p>
<p>30 Moons will you have in order to gain as many crystals as possible.  After 30 Moons your time will be up at which point you will have a score of total crystals.  This score will be shared on Game Center and you'll be able to try another 30 Moon campaign again.<br/><br/>Each 30 Moon session will be considered a ROUND and after a round is over you can upgrade your character and purchase other items for your character such as special powers, special moves, etc.<br/><br/>Your ultimate goal is to see how much money (Crystals) you can amass in a single 30 Moon campaign.<br/><br/>Along the way you will be able to go into various forests to do battle with monsters and evil enemies including other Vagen who wish to steal your goods from you to turn a profit.</p>
<p>You may even be sent on various missions and quests by various purchasers or suppliers of material in order for a price discount (Example: the sword smith who supplies swords may give you a discount if you get the Shard of Illumen which will help him to increase his sword creation output.  The Shard of Illumen is guarded by the Cyclops like monster in the cavern of Euridiya.  In exchange you will get discounted swords at half off for the next 10 rounds)</p>
<p>Other neat things you can do would be to purchase in-app Additional Moon cycles, so instead of a 30 Moon cycles, you can have a certain round played at 45 Moon cycles and hence increase your high score.</p>
<p>Along the way other quests and achievements will be built in with various updates to the app and there will be many in-app purchases and new quests and worlds to explore.</p>
<p>We are hoping that Pentora Vagen will be the next big hit and with your support we can really get this game out there :)</p>
<p>Over time we will start adding screenshots, videos, gameplay trailers, etc. So keep yourself posted here :)</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to get funding of $100,000 (100k) or more to help us in our efforts.  More would be grately appreciated, if we can hit a million that will help us even more!</p>
<p>We are hoping to have this project completed in about 4 months time, but pushing ourselves to have something ready for christmas if possible.</p>
<p>Proposed pricing of the game will be between FREE to $4.99 for the base price and then various in-app purchases ranging from $0.99 to $99.99.</p>
<p>The proposed base version will have Advertisments to support it and a removal of ads inside the game via in-app purchase.</p>
<p>So what we need the money for:<br/>1. Software and tools to help us in creating the game<br/>2. Purchasing various assets in the game or for paying for those who can create these assets (Sounds, Music, etc.)<br/>3. General funding of the Game to help us in our continued support of the game and future efforts (Updates, Maintenenace, etc.)<br/>4. Marketing the game (This can be pricey)<br/>5. Purchasing the latest testing devices if applicable (To make sure we are up to date with the latest iOS systems)<br/>6. If we can hit over the 200k mark then we will also start porting everything over to Android devices as well so that we can hit the worldwide audience even more.  If not we will still attempt the Android port, however it may take longer to port.<br/>7. Once again if we can hit the higher million mark then we will also invest into getting the game Localized into several major languages as well and can then setup our office to start developing more great game titles and running a successful Game business.<br/>8. To pay ourselves and staff for their hard work (No money = no staff = no game.  It takes money to make great works like this, hence why we chose to use Indiegogo as one of our options along with our own personal funds thus far)<br/><br/>If we don't hit our targets, we have made the campaign variable so that at least we can start with what we have and attempt to create the game with whatever you are willing to give us.  We are grateful for all your support and please know that we will still attempt to create the game with whatever budget is achieved.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>The game for one will be something to look forward to.  For all those who are taking part, we will make sure you are amongst the first to know about the launch and will make sure you get the BASE version for free (In order to do this we will keep the game free for the first week just to make sure you obtain a free copy of the base version.  After that if you do not obtain a free version you will pay between $0.99-$4.99 depending on the promotion for the BASE game).</p>

We are hoping that Pentora Vagen will be the next big hit and with your support we can really get this game out there :)
Over time we will start adding screenshots, videos, gameplay trailers, etc. So keep yourself posted here :)
What We Need
We are looking to get funding of $100,000 (100k) or more to help us in our efforts.  More would be grately appreciated, if we can hit a million that will help us even more!
We are hoping to have this project completed in about 4 months time, but pushing ourselves to have something ready for christmas if possible.
Proposed pricing of the game will be between FREE to $4.99 for the base price and then various in-app purchases ranging from $0.99 to $99.99.
The proposed base version will have Advertisments to support it and a removal of ads inside the game via in-app purchase.
So what we need the money for:1. Software and tools to help us in creating the game2. Purchasing various assets in the game or for paying for those who can create these assets (Sounds, Music, etc.)3. General funding of the Game to help us in our continued support of the game and future efforts (Updates, Maintenenace, etc.)4. Marketing the game (This can be pricey)5. Purchasing the latest testing devices if applicable (To make sure we are up to date with the latest iOS systems)6. If we can hit over the 200k mark then we will also start porting everything over to Android devices as well so that we can hit the worldwide audience even more.  If not we will still attempt the Android port, however it may take longer to port.7. Once again if we can hit the higher million mark then we will also invest into getting the game Localized into several major languages as well and can then setup our office to start developing more great game titles and running a successful Game business.8. To pay ourselves and staff for their hard work (No money = no staff = no game.  It takes money to make great works like this, hence why we chose to use Indiegogo as one of our options along with our own personal funds thus far)If we don't hit our targets, we have made the campaign variable so that at least we can start with what we have and attempt to create the game with whatever you are willing to give us.  We are grateful for all your support and please know that we will still attempt to create the game with whatever budget is achieved.
What You Get
The game for one will be something to look forward to.  For all those who are taking part, we will make sure you are amongst the first to know about the launch and will make sure you get the BASE version for free (In order to do this we will keep the game free for the first week just to make sure you obtain a free copy of the base version.  After that if you do not obtain a free version you will pay between $0.99-$4.99 depending on the promotion for the BASE game).
$10 Perk (BACKGROUND PACAKGE):$10 - You'll get an Image Background Package (For Windows or your Mac)$25 Perk (POSTCARD PACKAGE):$25 - You'll get everything from the $10 Perk + A postcard of Pentora Vagen sent to you via physical mail.

If you have ever been out of a job or lost everything due to corporate greed, then you know where we are coming from, this is a campaign for you!

<h2>Overview - What is <i>Deceptive Inc</i>?</h2>
<p>Hi there! Welcome to the official crowdfunding page for Deceptive Inc - a VR experience. Please watch our pitch film to get a greater understanding of the overall experience or take a look down below for further information.</p>
<p><i>Deceptive Inc</i> is a VR Escape Room Experience created by five 4th semester students (Anders, Jeppe, Jens-Julius, Magnus &amp; Theis) all from the film school VIA Film &amp; Transmedia in Aarhus, Denmark. </p>
<p>In <i>Deceptive Inc </i>you are placed in the shoes of office worker <i>1326</i> in a small 1990's office cubicle - where you are told to work. Throughout the VR-experience, you will discover that the work you're doing might not be what you think it is, and in reality, it's all a simulation set up by an AI who wants you to do its dirty work. Your task is to escape the simulation and make the endless work end. Yet how you do it, and if you do so, is up to you. </p>
<p>The game is set to be released on STEAM through STEAM DIRECT. Anyone with a VR-Computer based headset will be able to play - FOR FREE! Since we're on a tight student budget we need your help to develop, create and distribute the experience!</p>
<h2><strong>How did <i>Deceptive Inc</i> come to be? </strong></h2>
<p>The modern society places high demands on how we as humans shall live and behave. You can live your whole life by following only the norms of society, and completely forget to follow your own thoughts and dreams. Almost like robots that just do what they are told. In <i>Deceptive Inc</i> you are inside a simulated world that mimics this kind of society, where everything is pre-programmed, and put into a system. It's the player's task to wake up from this 'trance', break the system, and thus find its own identity in this simulated world. </p>
<p>The driven force to create <i>Deceptive Inc</i> is made from a common motivation in going to the same film school and primarily having made short films in our young career as filmmakers. We teamed up because we have a united love for the VR-media and we all wanted to make something different for our 4th-semester exam - instead of any other traditional media (short film, music video, commercials etc.). We wanted to make something that could give us a challenge, more perspective, and knowledge in creating other unique audiovisual media.</p>
<div>
<h3>Impact, Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>First and foremost - we can't stretch this enough: This project is part of our exam, and therefore we have a deadline, which gives you a guarantee of seeing this as a finish VR-experience in the nearest future.</p>
<p>However, we're not going to hide the fact that <i>Deceptive Inc</i> is our first major VR-project. We knew from the get-go that there were going to be a lot of risks and surprises that could come our way as VR-greenhorns - especially considering our short 2-month time constraint our exam demands - but we do like a good challenge and we're aiming high. We want this to be a SUPER COOL VR-experience that will provide us with a lot of knowledge which we can benefit from in our future as VR creators. We are ready to tackle any hurdle coming our way. We have the skills, we have the passion and we have the gumption.</p>
<p>All we need now is your help!</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Hard Earned Money Will Go Towards</h3>
<p>Again, since <i>Deceptive Inc</i> is a VR school exam project for our 4th-semester we want to clarify completely: <u>EVERYBODY ON THE PROJECT - ARE WORKING FOR FREE</u>! Nobody gets paid. It’s all about the passion for the experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, every and any donation goes explicitly towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional English Voice Actors</li>
<li>Renting Professional VR-Equipment (INSTA 360 PRO 8K)</li>

<li>Paying the fee for uploading the game through Steam Direct (100$)</li>

One of the medium goals is the prime goal and is essential to the survival of the group (the other medium and hard goals are in place so that ideally, the players can maximize the success of their community).

<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">-or-</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">2. The prime goal is uncompleted, in which case everyone loses regardless of individual goal completion.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">This forces players to balance out their own goals and the goals of the group. Focus too much on group goals and the temptation to slip in an individual goal makes one player win. Focus too much on individual goals and no one wins. Different players will also play Conclave very differently. Conclave can be collaborative, competitive or anything in between depending on the players who play it.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">-Sunny the Thumb, three days before being executed for wearing a wire.</span></p>
<h1><span style=""font-style: normal;"">How does gameplay work?</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The first step in a game of Conclave is world building. Players go around the table and establish details of the setting of the game. Either a regimented set up can be used (where a set order of properties is established: Problem, Place, People, etc.) or a free form set up (where no set order is followed, for example, one person could come up with the </span><b style=""font-style: normal;"">Problem</b><span style=""font-style: normal;""> that the last of a lineage of kings is dying, then the next could determine that the </span><b style=""font-style: normal;"">Place</b><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is the last, dying city and the third determine that the </span><b style=""font-style: normal;"">People</b><span style=""font-style: normal;""> are humans who fled into underground shelter when the bombs first dropped). This allows multiple ways of play depending on player preferences and imagination. Then, the setting is further expanded with multiple sentences detailing the state of the community in depth. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;""><strong>Note:</strong> Conclave is designed to be as flexible and enjoyable as possible, so, specific settings and play styles incorporate tweaked rule sets. The rulebook includes the most common of these variants for everything for mechanical aspects of play like character creation and the end game scoring as well as setting specific aspects like having one character as a 'traitor' or ending the game at a set time, such as when the police come to investigate the strange sounds from the attic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The second step is to determine characters. In Conclave, you never determine your own character, rather, everyone contributes to every character, as in each step of creation, characters are passed along to the next person to write the next attribute. Characters each have unique advantages (such as having a contact in the FBI) and flaws (like having a zombie-bitten daughter) that they, or other characters, can invoke during the game. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Then, being a card driven game, 2 sub-decks are formed. Conclave uses two types of sub-decks: The event deck and the player deck. These are formed through distribution of the cards in a normal 52 card deck. The event deck determines what types of events your community will face, and the player deck determines the range of players actions towards each other. Each suit determines either the outcome of the event or the player action. Considering both sub-decks are created from the same 52 card poker deck, a game can be played with balanced decks, especially harsh events but limited player action or vice versa. The sub-decks can further be customized by the removal of cards. These sub-decks will then be shuffled.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Next, play starts. Every character is given a hand of cards and one player is chosen to be the starting narrator. An event card is flipped over and, based on suit and number, the narrator describes what happens. Then, players are allowed to respond however they'd like, through playing cards (which are only replenished by very specific draws from the event deck, and thus valuable), committing individual actions or calling for a vote. In the case of a vote, both sides of an issue are discussed, and then all players vote (unless they choose to abstain). If there is a tie nothing happens and you're forced to wait until the next round to vote again, meaning that if, for example, you can't decide whether to lock your town down from the invading orcs or mount an offensive, neither happens, and you put everyone at risk. Play continues, the narrator switching to the next player counterclockwise at the end of every turn, until an end condition is met. Many scenarios can have custom end conditions but the standard end condition is 3 turns after the prime goal is met, or when the event sub-deck runs out. </span></p>

What is Conclave?
Conclave is a card driven table top role playing game in the vein of Fiasco or The Quiet Year where instead of the traditional need for set up, a complex rules set and one player to act as the Game Master and facilitate the game, you set up during play, the rules are minimal but impactful and every player takes an equal role in the game.
The goal of Conclave is to simulate the meaningful and tough decisions any community's leaders must make. The players each act as a member of the governing body of the community, which can range from village elders to heads of interplanetary civilizations and everything in between.
Conclave is setting neutral, meaning it doesn't take place anywhere inherently, and can be easily adapted to any number of places and times, both real and unreal. Every quote at the head of each section in this description is taken from a trial game of Conclave, each using a different setting which was come up with during the game itself. Some examples of settings are:

A post zombie apocalypse group of survivors running low on supplies, stranded in rural Missouri.
An isolated planetary colony where people are disappearing, leaving behind only a rut in the ground, which runs to the foothills and the unexplored mountains before abruptly disappearing in the same place each time.
A 16th century coven of witches in Salem, Massachusetts who find that someone or something is causing famine and disease and blaming it on them.
A 1930s Chicago mob, who find that a rat is in their midst.

The rulebook will be full of these and other example scenarios in order to outline the mechanics of play through demonstration. There will also be several prebuilt scenarios complete with roles for each player.

A distinct change Conclave brings to the table (top), is that it is, rather than a completely collaborative game, a semi-competitive one with multiple win conditions. Every community has a pyramid of goals, with three easy goals, two medium goals, and one hard one. Easy goals are stepping stones to medium goals, and medium to hard.

Focus too much on individual goals and no one wins. Different players will also play Conclave very differently. Conclave can be collaborative, competitive or anything in between depending on the players who play it.

<p>Rollspelet Western är på väg ut i en fjärde helt reviderad
upplaga, där all text, delar av regelmotorn och alla illustrationer är helt
nya. Spelet tar sitt fokus i Amerika 1876 och blandar den klassiska
västernmyten med pulserande storstadsliv i New York och plantagernas sydstater,
där bitterheten efter Inbördeskriget fortfarande är stor. Western ger en god
inblick i en dynamisk och spännande epok, där den tekniska utvecklingen går
framåt med stormsteg och ändrar hela landet. Rollpersonerna möter kallhamrade
desperados, skoningslösa prisjägare, omutliga lagmän, tappra indiankrigare,
korrumperade indianagenter och svavelosande domedagspredikanter. Ranchkrig
blossar upp, guldruscher lockar tusentals lycksökare, byar lever i skräck för
stora banditgäng och rättvisa skipas av den som drar snabbast. Western är ett
spel för äventyrare och hjältar.<br/></p>
<p>Då denna kampanj är avslutad kommer vi att förbereda de två
grundböckerna Rollpersonen och Regelboken för tryck. Samtidigt har vi så
otroligt mycket extra vi vill göra för att expandera spelet ytterligare – och
med din hjälp hoppas vi att det blir möjligt.</p>

<p>Postorderkatalogen – även känt som prylar, prylar, prylar.
Denna nya modul består av två delar; en katalog att använda helt och hållet ”in
game” och en mer traditionell bakgrundsbok för spelledaren, som innehåller
regler, intressant information som _inte_ står med i katalogen, illustrerade
spelledarpersoner, äventyrsuppslag, och mycket mer. Tanken med detta supplement
är att låta rollpersonerna hitta saker de vill lägga pengar på, oavsett vilken
bana de har valt i livet. Dessutom underlättar katalogen för de rollpersoner
som vill dra igång egna verksamheter. Postorderföretaget och deras försäljare kan även dyka upp i flera olika kampanjer.</p>

<p>Inga delmål under denna kampanj kommer att försena trycket
av Westerns två grundböcker Rollpersonen och Regelboken. Istället har vi valt
att ge ut två unika samlingsvolymer – En handfull artiklar respektive En
handfull äventyr - i pdf-format. Dessa två samlingar kommer endast att finnas
tillgängliga under denna kampanj. Där samlas en del tidigare material med nytt,
tidigare opublicerat. Andra typer av delmål är att vi garanterar utgivningen av
nya tillbehör, och när en titel på detta sätt blir upplåst kan du också
beställa den. I en del fall har vi valt att sätta delmål som utökar dessa nya
titlar med mer material.<br/></p>
<p>I
listan över delmål som följer har vi valt att markera varje nivå med en av tre
olika symboler. Sheriffstjärnan markerar att det tillägg vi vill göra är
antingen att vi förbinder oss att trycka en helt bok till Western, eller att vi
utökar någon tryckt bok till Western på något sätt. Kortleken markerar att
samlingsvolymen En Handfull Artiklar utökas med nytt material, medan Derringern
visar att utökningen sker i den andra samlingsvolymen, En Handfull Äventyr.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Nästa delmål<br/>

<b>I månens klara sken</b><br/><p>En Handfull Äventyr utökas med denna historia om boskapsstölder i Arizona och vem man egentligen kan lita på.<br/></p>

<h3>
<b>Grundbok III: Amerika 1876</b>
</h3>
<p>I Amerika 1876 står de forna
 nordstaterna för den ekonomiska och politiska makten. Här görs 
överenskommelser i slutna rum som betyder skillnad på liv och död i 
resten av landet. I industrialismens skugga växer slummen – och 
reformrörelser som nykterhetsrörelsen, suffragetterna och 
abolitionisterna. I den politiska och byråkratiska maktapparaten är 
korruptionen utbredd, alla kan köpas och makt för maktens egen skull är 
ledstjärna.<br/><br/>I de forna sydstaterna vädrar rasisterna morgonluft 
då den militära ockupationen rullas tillbaka och det direkta politiska 
styret från norr avslutas. Ku Klux Klan har svårare att verka öppet, men
 den organiserade rasismen breder ut sig. Gevärsklubbar där alla är 
klädda likadant driver politiskt propaganda i formation och med vapen i 
hand – på dagarna genom att skjuta i luften och visa upp sig, på kvällar
 och nätter genom hotfulla och våldsamma besök hos svarta, idealister 
och profitörer från norr. Redeemers pratar om delstaternas rätt till 
självstyre och att skatt innebär ofrihet och korruption, men deras 
förslag leder till rasistisk särbehandling. Militären saknar mandat att 
ingripa mot det rasistiska våldet. Rasisterna möter dock motstånd, på 
orter som New Orleans har svarta makt och är fruktade även i bredare 
kretsar (rykten om voodoo hjälper till).<br/><br/>I västern möts alla 
intressen. Hit tar sig människor i hopp om en bättre framtid. Många 
lockas av drömmen om lättbrutet guld, andra har lämnat fattigdomen i 
Europa för en egen farm. En del söker äventyr, letar försvunna skatter, 
drar runt mellan spelhålor i Kansas boskapsstäder, osv. Andra vill bara 
vara ifred. De flesta ser indianer som ett hinder. Vissa har personliga 
skäl att frukta och hata indianerna, andra vill bara åt deras mark. 
Indiankrigens centrum är Black Hills. Där har de vita hittat guld, och i
 depressionens skugga kan en ny guldrusch få igång ekonomin igen, så 
indianernas reservat är i vägen. I Arizona leder Geronimo apachernas 
motstånd. San Francisco är porten mot Asien, med ett stort Chinatown.<br/><br/>Amerika
 1876 är en mångfacetterad och dynamisk spelvärld, med plats flera många
 olika sorters äventyr. Vi har proppat denna grundbok full med 
beskrivningar av organisationer och sammanslutningar till 
ögonblicksbilder av vad som händer i olika delar av landet.</p>
<p>Boken trycks i fyrfärg med
hårda pärmar. <br/>

Många som kämpar för ett fritt Irland tvingas lämna den gröna ön för att undkomma britterna, men kampen och motståndet fortsätter i USA. I detta avsnitt berättar vi mer om olika organisationer, deras planer, nyckelpersoner (med bild) samt äventyrsuppslag. Materialet kan användas som bakgrund för rollpersonen eller som motståndare eller allierade i ett äventyr eller en kampanj.</p>
<p><b>Amerika 1876 - Nykterhetsrörelsen</b><br/>Kapitlet om Sammanslutningar i Amerika 1876 kommer att utökas med ett avsnitt om nykterhetsrörelsen, och några av de mest hängivna i kampen för att förbjuda alkohol. Självfallet blir det illustrerade spelledarpersoner och äventyrsuppslag kopplade till denna organisation.</p>
<p><b>Amerika

III: Amerika 1876, tillsammans med en illustrerad spelledarperson och
äventyrsuppslag. Få organisationer är lika inflytelserika och de flesta hemliga

<h3>Dakota och Deadwood</h3>En
 maffig kampanjbok med en övergripande beskrivning av Dakotaterritoriet 
och en utförlig presentation av staden Deadwood och dess invånare. 
Dakota &amp; Deadwood är en utmärkt setting för äventyr som handlar om 
guldruscher, stadsbyggande, girighet och inte minst indianer. 
Indianernas situation ställs på sin spets då de måste välja på reservat 
eller strid. Det är en plats och en tid fylld av konflikter, intriger 
och äventyrsuppslag. Henrik Örnebring är huvudförfattare, Maria Bergius

Det är den kallaste vintern i mannaminne, när Washington beslutar att indianerna i området måste infinna sig på reservat – eller ses som fiender i krig, samtidigt som de mest våghalsiga lycksökarna söker sig till guldfyndigheterna Black Hills för att hinna dit före alla andra.</p>

<p>Postorderkatalogen – även känt som prylar, prylar, prylar.
Denna nya modul består av två delar; en katalog att använda helt och hållet ”in
game” och en mer traditionell bakgrundsbok för spelledaren, som innehåller
regler, intressant information som _inte_ står med i katalogen, illustrerade
spelledarpersoner, äventyrsuppslag, och mycket mer. Tanken med detta supplement
är att låta rollpersonerna hitta saker de vill lägga pengar på, oavsett vilken
bana de har valt i livet. Dessutom underlättar katalogen för de rollpersoner
som vill dra igång egna verksamheter. Postorderföretaget och deras försäljare kan även dyka upp i flera olika kampanjer.</p>

<h3>New Orleans</h3>
<p>Ny kampanjbok till Western IV om en stad som inte liknar

illustrerade personer och äventyrsuppslag inom allsköns områden. Dessutom ingår

<p></p>En handfull äventyr innehåller i sitt grundformat det tidigare opublicerade äventyret Revolverns lag (ca 40 sidor tjockt inklusive handouts, rollformulär, etc) samt fyra kortare äventyr som tidigare publicerats i Fenix. Därutöver har vi flera tidigare opublicerade äventyr på lager, som vi gärna skulle vilja utöka äventyrssamlingen med, som Frihetens Pris, Förrädarnas Skatt och Kalla Hjärtan. Även en del tidigare publicerade äventyr som konverteras till det nya regelsystemet kan bli aktuella, som exempelvis Kuppen i Mission Hill. Ännu roligare är att nya delmål även kan komma att låsa upp helt nyskrivna äventyr, bland annat av Magnus Seter och Gunilla Jonsson &amp; Michael Petersen. Allt material som hamnar i denna samling kommer att få en extra genomarbetning för att anpassas helt efter Western IV, sättas om i de nya mallarna och konverteras till de nya reglerna. Om kampanjen går tillräckligt bra för att göra en tryckt version av samlingen möjlig till ett vettigt pris kommer vi även att erbjuda detta som uppgradering. <br/><br/>En Handfull Äventyr innehåller nu:<br/><ul>

Western har även ett fristående figurspel: Guld &amp; Bly. Åskfågeln ger även ut rollspelet Ensamma Vargen, baserat på de klassiska bokäventyren som nu åter ges ut på svenska. Spelförlaget ger även ut Fenix – speltidningen.se – som är Sveriges bredaste speltidning, där rollspel står i fokus. Tidningen har en återkommande skämtserie av Åke Rosenius, Birger Barbaren, som även finns i ett samlingsalbum. Åskfågeln består av Tove och Anders Gillbring samt Lukas Thelin.<br/></div>","Rollspelet Western är på väg ut i en fjärde helt reviderad
upplaga, där all text, delar av regelmotorn och alla illustrationer är helt
nya. Spelet tar sitt fokus i Amerika 1876 och blandar den klassiska
västernmyten med pulserande storstadsliv i New York och plantagernas sydstater,
där bitterheten efter Inbördeskriget fortfarande är stor. Western ger en god
inblick i en dynamisk och spännande epok, där den tekniska utvecklingen går
framåt med stormsteg och ändrar hela landet. Rollpersonerna möter kallhamrade
desperados, skoningslösa prisjägare, omutliga lagmän, tappra indiankrigare,
korrumperade indianagenter och svavelosande domedagspredikanter. Ranchkrig
blossar upp, guldruscher lockar tusentals lycksökare, byar lever i skräck för
stora banditgäng och rättvisa skipas av den som drar snabbast. Western är ett
spel för äventyrare och hjältar.
Då denna kampanj är avslutad kommer vi att förbereda de två
grundböckerna Rollpersonen och Regelboken för tryck. Samtidigt har vi så
otroligt mycket extra vi vill göra för att expandera spelet ytterligare – och
med din hjälp hoppas vi att det blir möjligt.
Här nedan kan du ladda ner en förhandstitt på några uppslag ur Grundbok I och II.

Inga delmål under denna kampanj kommer att försena trycket
av Westerns två grundböcker Rollpersonen och Regelboken. Istället har vi valt
att ge ut två unika samlingsvolymer – En handfull artiklar respektive En
handfull äventyr - i pdf-format. Dessa två samlingar kommer endast att finnas
tillgängliga under denna kampanj. Där samlas en del tidigare material med nytt,
tidigare opublicerat. Andra typer av delmål är att vi garanterar utgivningen av
nya tillbehör, och när en titel på detta sätt blir upplåst kan du också
beställa den. I en del fall har vi valt att sätta delmål som utökar dessa nya
titlar med mer material.
I
listan över delmål som följer har vi valt att markera varje nivå med en av tre
olika symboler. Sheriffstjärnan markerar att det tillägg vi vill göra är
antingen att vi förbinder oss att trycka en helt bok till Western, eller att vi
utökar någon tryckt bok till Western på något sätt. Kortleken markerar att
samlingsvolymen En Handfull Artiklar utökas med nytt material, medan Derringern
visar att utökningen sker i den andra samlingsvolymen, En Handfull Äventyr.
Nästa delmål

I månens klara skenEn Handfull Äventyr utökas med denna historia om boskapsstölder i Arizona och vem man egentligen kan lita på.














































































Alla som väljer en perk som innehåller Western IV kommer
även att få belöningar för varje 5000 Euro vi når upp i. Dessa belöningar är bara
tillgängliga för dig som deltar i vår crowdfunding (eller har förhandsbokat Western
IV sedan tidigare). Vad det blir för belöning varje gång avslöjar vi först då
målet har passerats. För att göra det extra tydligt att det är dags för en Belöningsnivå har vi markerat alla dessa med ett guldmynt, en double eagle från
1876.

16-sidigt äventyr - Alla som deltar i vår crowdfunding, eller har förhandsbeställt Western IV, kommer att få ett exklusivt äventyr som inte går att beställa efter crowdfundingen.
Affisch - Alla som deltar i crowdfundingen kommer att få en A2 affisch med Lukas Thelins omslagsbild för Revolverns Lag.




Alla som skaffat Western IV i något utförande under denna crowdfunding kommer även att få en pdf på Grundbok II: Regelboken så fort den har skickats till tryck. Det räcker med att du har införskaffat Grundbok II: Regelboken för att få denna titel i pdf.
Texas Ranger - Specialskriven och illustrerad bonusroll med egna livsöden. Skickas i pdf-format.
Den sista rewarden blev en ny pdf-fil, denna gång med nya Livsödestabeller för er som vill spela Hillbillys. Tanken med dessa är att de används istället för Etnisk Bakgrund när ni slår för era släktingar, snarare än för Rollens Livsöden.



Under
 de år vi har utvecklat Westerns fjärde utgåva har vi arbetat parallellt
 med frilansare för att kunna hålla en hög utgivningstakt när spelet väl
 släppts. Under crowdfundingens gång kommer flera av dem att bli 
upplåsta, vilket innebär att vi garanterar att de blir av och du kunna 
skaffa dem som helt nya perks under kampanjen. De böcker som ligger 
närmast är Grundbok III: Amerika 1876, Dakota & Deadwood, New Mexico
 & Santa Fe, Postorderkatalogen samt New Orleans. Du kan även hjälpa
 oss att utöka dessa moduler med extra material, framför allt i form av 
fler spelledarpersoner och äventyrsuppslag, som finns med som egna 
delmål.Den största nyheten är dock att vi är beredda att 
garantera en stor äventyrskampanj i tre delar, förutsatt att den blir 
upplåst och dessa delmål uppnådda. Det blir ett renodlat 
Åskfågelnprojekt, där Anders och Tove Gillbring skriver materialet, 
medan Lukas Thelin illustrerar.

Grundbok III: Amerika 1876

I Amerika 1876 står de forna
 nordstaterna för den ekonomiska och politiska makten. Här görs 
överenskommelser i slutna rum som betyder skillnad på liv och död i 
resten av landet. I industrialismens skugga växer slummen – och 
reformrörelser som nykterhetsrörelsen, suffragetterna och 
abolitionisterna. I den politiska och byråkratiska maktapparaten är 
korruptionen utbredd, alla kan köpas och makt för maktens egen skull är 
ledstjärna.I de forna sydstaterna vädrar rasisterna morgonluft 
då den militära ockupationen rullas tillbaka och det direkta politiska 
styret från norr avslutas. Ku Klux Klan har svårare att verka öppet, men
 den organiserade rasismen breder ut sig. Gevärsklubbar där alla är 
klädda likadant driver politiskt propaganda i formation och med vapen i 
hand – på dagarna genom att skjuta i luften och visa upp sig, på kvällar
 och nätter genom hotfulla och våldsamma besök hos svarta, idealister 
och profitörer från norr. Redeemers pratar om delstaternas rätt till 
självstyre och att skatt innebär ofrihet och korruption, men deras 
förslag leder till rasistisk särbehandling. Militären saknar mandat att 
ingripa mot det rasistiska våldet. Rasisterna möter dock motstånd, på 
orter som New Orleans har svarta makt och är fruktade även i bredare 
kretsar (rykten om voodoo hjälper till).I västern möts alla 
intressen. Hit tar sig människor i hopp om en bättre framtid. Många 
lockas av drömmen om lättbrutet guld, andra har lämnat fattigdomen i 
Europa för en egen farm. En del söker äventyr, letar försvunna skatter, 
drar runt mellan spelhålor i Kansas boskapsstäder, osv. Andra vill bara 
vara ifred. De flesta ser indianer som ett hinder. Vissa har personliga 
skäl att frukta och hata indianerna, andra vill bara åt deras mark. 
Indiankrigens centrum är Black Hills. Där har de vita hittat guld, och i
 depressionens skugga kan en ny guldrusch få igång ekonomin igen, så 
indianernas reservat är i vägen. I Arizona leder Geronimo apachernas 
motstånd. San Francisco är porten mot Asien, med ett stort Chinatown.Amerika
 1876 är en mångfacetterad och dynamisk spelvärld, med plats flera många

hårda pärmar.

Dakota och DeadwoodEn
 maffig kampanjbok med en övergripande beskrivning av Dakotaterritoriet 
och en utförlig presentation av staden Deadwood och dess invånare. 
Dakota & Deadwood är en utmärkt setting för äventyr som handlar om 
guldruscher, stadsbyggande, girighet och inte minst indianer. 
Indianernas situation ställs på sin spets då de måste välja på reservat 
eller strid. Det är en plats och en tid fylld av konflikter, intriger 
och äventyrsuppslag. Henrik Örnebring är huvudförfattare, Maria Bergius 
Krämer skriver om indianer (och speglar Henriks äventyr ur indianernas 
perspektiv, om ni vill testa en annorlunda spelupplevelse. Dessutom 
väntas tillägg från Tove & Anders Gillbring. Boken trycks i fyrfärg med hårda pärmar. Släpps tredje kvartalet 2015.Uppfyllda delmålSpelledarpersoner och äventyrsuppslagKapitlet om Dakota kommer att

Äventyr till Dakota & DeadwoodDakota & Deadwood kommer att förses med ytterligare ett fullängdsäventyr, nyskrivet av Tove och Anders Gillbring. De äventyr som ingår nu tar sitt avstamp hösten 1876, och det nya vrider tillbaka tiden ytterligare några månader till början av år 1876. Det är den kallaste vintern i mannaminne, när Washington beslutar att indianerna i området måste infinna sig på reservat – eller ses som fiender i krig, samtidigt som de mest våghalsiga lycksökarna söker sig till guldfyndigheterna Black Hills för att hinna dit före alla andra.
Dakota & DeadwoodKapitlet om Black Hills kommer att förses med fler spelledarpersoner och extra äventyrsuppslag.

Postorderkatalogen


Postorderkatalogen – även känt som prylar, prylar, prylar.
Denna nya modul består av två delar; en katalog att använda helt och hållet ”in
game” och en mer traditionell bakgrundsbok för spelledaren, som innehåller
regler, intressant information som _inte_ står med i katalogen, illustrerade
spelledarpersoner, äventyrsuppslag, och mycket mer. Tanken med detta supplement
är att låta rollpersonerna hitta saker de vill lägga pengar på, oavsett vilken
bana de har valt i livet. Dessutom underlättar katalogen för de rollpersoner
som vill dra igång egna verksamheter. Postorderföretaget och deras försäljare kan även dyka upp i flera olika kampanjer.
Släpps andra kvartalet 2016.


New Orleans
Ny kampanjbok till Western IV om en stad som inte liknar
någon annan – och omgivningen runt omkring New Orleans. Joakim Andersson har
skrivit denna omfattande stadsmodul, där ett pulserande nöjesliv blandas med
misär, korruption, plantageliv och voodoo. Det kryllar av platsbeskrivningar,
illustrerade personer och äventyrsuppslag inom allsköns områden. Dessutom ingår
en liten turistbroschyr som kan delas ut till nyanlända rollpersoner på besök.

  






  Denna samlingsvolym är exklusiv för Westerns Crowdfundingkampanj, du kommer bara att hitta den här. I sitt grundutförande innehåller den tidigare opublicerade artikeln Santa Fes Spritualistiska Förening, en sammanslutning som presenteras med spelledarpersoner och äventyrskrokar. Dessutom har vi med de bästa Westernartiklarna ur Fenix, som nu fått en ordentlig genomarbetning för att anpassas helt till den nya upplagan av spelet (alla spelvärden har konverterats, materialet sätts om i Westerns nya mallar, etc).Sedan hoppas vi förstås att samlingen kommer att innehålla väldigt mycket mer innan vi är klara, inte minst eftersom vi haft kontakt med flera av våra favoritskribenter och bett dem bidra med extra material som kan bli upplåst via delmål. En del namn är gamla Westernbekanta, som Henrik Örnebring, Christoffer Krämer, Johan Englund, Joakim Andersson samt Michael Pettersen och Gunilla Jonsson. Andra står beredda att skriva sitt första större Westernmaterial, som Kenneth Hite, Anders Blixt, Marcus Brissman och Arvid Björklund. Vårt mål är att det här skall bli en galet välmatad samling med massor av inspirerande material. Blir intresset tillräckligt stort för att kunna göra ett tryck rimligt rent kostnadsmässigt kommer vi även att lägga till en möjlighet att uppgradera till en tryckt bok.En Handfull Artiklar innehåller just nu:

En handfull äventyr innehåller i sitt grundformat det tidigare opublicerade äventyret Revolverns lag (ca 40 sidor tjockt inklusive handouts, rollformulär, etc) samt fyra kortare äventyr som tidigare publicerats i Fenix. Därutöver har vi flera tidigare opublicerade äventyr på lager, som vi gärna skulle vilja utöka äventyrssamlingen med, som Frihetens Pris, Förrädarnas Skatt och Kalla Hjärtan. Även en del tidigare publicerade äventyr som konverteras till det nya regelsystemet kan bli aktuella, som exempelvis Kuppen i Mission Hill. Ännu roligare är att nya delmål även kan komma att låsa upp helt nyskrivna äventyr, bland annat av Magnus Seter och Gunilla Jonsson & Michael Petersen. Allt material som hamnar i denna samling kommer att få en extra genomarbetning för att anpassas helt efter Western IV, sättas om i de nya mallarna och konverteras till de nya reglerna. Om kampanjen går tillräckligt bra för att göra en tryckt version av samlingen möjlig till ett vettigt pris kommer vi även att erbjuda detta som uppgradering. En Handfull Äventyr innehåller nu:
Revolverns Lag –tidigare opublicerat, ca 40 sidor.
Frihetens pris –tidigare opublicerat, ca 36 sidor.
Kalla Hjärtan – tidigare opublicerat och nu omarbetat, ca 36 sidor.
Förrädarnas skatt - tidigare opublicerat och nu omarbetat, ca 40 sidor.

Detta spelförlag brinner för spel och har rötter tillbaka till 80-talet, då flaggskeppet Western gavs ut i sin första inkarnation. 2014 är det dags för en ny upplaga. Western har även ett fristående figurspel: Guld & Bly. Åskfågeln ger även ut rollspelet Ensamma Vargen, baserat på de klassiska bokäventyren som nu åter ges ut på svenska. Spelförlaget ger även ut Fenix – speltidningen.se – som är Sveriges bredaste speltidning, där rollspel står i fokus. Tidningen har en återkommande skämtserie av Åke Rosenius, Birger Barbaren, som även finns i ett samlingsalbum. Åskfågeln består av Tove och Anders Gillbring samt Lukas Thelin.",36.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We’re just parents looking for inspiring role models for our 7-year-old daughter.  We realised that we all know singers, actresses, etc., but in the end very little about the great women of science.  A quick search demonstrated that they do exist, but that for historical reasons they’ve rarely received the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>Being from Québec, we naturally thought that if collectible hockey cards let kids know about their favourite hockey players, there’s no reason the same tactic wouldn’t work with scientists who’ve made extraordinary discoveries.</p>
<p>But for it to work, the game had to both look good and be lots of fun – we didn’t want to produce a pack of cards that would just gather dust in a drawer!</p>
<p>To take care of the visual appeal, we got in touch with our friend Fran6co.  Francis is a passionate artist who’s drawn many comics, including <a href=""http://didjeridu.webcomics.fr/page/the-call-of-the-didjeridu-the-comic-strip-about-the-didj"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Call of the Didjeridu</a>. In the latter, he “cartoonified” several real people with really cool results. So we thought he’d be perfect for our scientists.</p>
<p>For the fun side of things, we tried out many ideas, first on paper and then with pretend-cards, trying to come up with a formula that included an element of chance but also required strategizing, with unexpected reversals and multiple possible decisions that could lead to winning tactics, while remaining simple enough for a child to understand within five minutes and start playing.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>Each player receives 6 cards, the deck is put at the center of the table and the first card is removed to start the discard pile. The goal is to collect 4 cards of the same color to form a « lab ». The first player who forms 3 labs wins.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a turn, the player chooses to take a card from the deck or to take the first card of the discard pile. At the end of the turn, he can only keep 6 cards in his hand, the rest has to be discarded.<br/><br/>To spice up things, some cards have more than one color, and special cards permit to take any scientist from the discard pile, steal 2 scientists from an opponent's lab (the lab is destroyed and the remains return in the opponent's hand) or make an exact copy of a scientist.<br/> <h3>Final Product Video</h3>

<h3></h3>
</div><p><b>About us</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can see our previous Meiko Indiegogo campaigns:
Lizardmen and Kaos Dwarves. <b>All the packages of these two campaigns were
shipped in less than 3 months after the campaign ended up</b>, accomplishing the estimated
shipment dates stated on the campaign descriptions:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-chaos-dwarf-fantasy-football-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-chaos-dwarf-fantasy-football-team</span></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Currently, <b>we are also running another Indiegogo
campaign, the Meiko Ratmen Team:</b></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniature-s-ratmen-fantasy-football-team/x/2362463"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniature-s-ratmen-fantasy-football-team/x/2362463</span></a></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the
release of the ultimate Lizardmen Team and the ultimate Kaos Dwarf Team, and
with the Meiko Ratmen Team actually active, the Meiko <span>Miniatures new project is the Undead - Necromantic Team. The
Undead Team will include: 2 Mummies, 2 Wights, 4 Ghouls, 2 Skeletons and 8
Zombies (2 Standard Zombies and 6 Racial Zombies). The Necromantic Team will
include: 2 Flesh Golems, 2 Werewolves, 2 Wights, 2 Ghouls and 8 Zombies (2
Standard Zombies and 6 Racial Zombies). The campaign will also include 5 Star
Players and several more items: Undead Plastic Gaming Mat, racial Range Ruler, racial
d6 Dice, </span><span>a Mummy Football</span>… </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sculpting of all these miniatures has already been
made. Only the Star Players need to be sculpted. But we need your help for the
casting process. That way, we will be able to release the Meiko Undead and
Necromantic Teams much sooner than what was initially planned. Using Indiegogo
as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new miniatures
and other interesting items, obtain feedback from our customers and it gives us
confidence to keep working on. In exchange you will get some cool rewards.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including
the <span>Mummy Football</span>. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany,
the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the
Willy Chaos Team and the 2 Willy Halfling Teams. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sculptor
of all the miniatures of these 2 teams is Franarcilla, the skilled sculptor of
many other Meiko  teams like the Chaos
Dwarf, Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of
them. Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark
sculpting style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Undead minis
will fit with the image we all have in mind when we think about Undead.
Currently, Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of
the best and most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide </p>

Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.
You can see our previous Meiko Indiegogo campaigns:
Lizardmen and Kaos Dwarves. All the packages of these two campaigns were
shipped in less than 3 months after the campaign ended up, accomplishing the estimated
shipment dates stated on the campaign descriptions:
http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team
http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-chaos-dwarf-fantasy-football-team
Currently, we are also running another Indiegogo
campaign, the Meiko Ratmen Team:
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniature-s-ratmen-fantasy-football-team/x/2362463

Why crowdfunding?
After the
release of the ultimate Lizardmen Team and the ultimate Kaos Dwarf Team, and
with the Meiko Ratmen Team actually active, the Meiko Miniatures new project is the Undead - Necromantic Team. The
Undead Team will include: 2 Mummies, 2 Wights, 4 Ghouls, 2 Skeletons and 8
Zombies (2 Standard Zombies and 6 Racial Zombies). The Necromantic Team will
include: 2 Flesh Golems, 2 Werewolves, 2 Wights, 2 Ghouls and 8 Zombies (2
Standard Zombies and 6 Racial Zombies). The campaign will also include 5 Star
Players and several more items: Undead Plastic Gaming Mat, racial Range Ruler, racial
d6 Dice, a Mummy Football… 
The sculpting of all these miniatures has already been
made. Only the Star Players need to be sculpted. But we need your help for the
casting process. That way, we will be able to release the Meiko Undead and
Necromantic Teams much sooner than what was initially planned. Using Indiegogo
as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new miniatures
and other interesting items, obtain feedback from our customers and it gives us
confidence to keep working on. In exchange you will get some cool rewards.
All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including
the Mummy Football. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany,
the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the
Willy Chaos Team and the 2 Willy Halfling Teams. 
The sculptor
of all the miniatures of these 2 teams is Franarcilla, the skilled sculptor of
many other Meiko  teams like the Chaos
Dwarf, Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of
them. Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark
sculpting style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Undead minis
will fit with the image we all have in mind when we think about Undead.
Currently, Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of
the best and most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide

<p><i>I set a goal for myself for 2014, and that was to build a game from start to finish. I spent most of the year drawing, writing, testing, and sourcing parts, and now I'm ready to put it all together.</i></p>
<p>I love games but I always have a hard time finding good one- and two-player sets. Most games <i>say </i>you can play with two players, but are almost always <i>best </i>with more people than I can honestly get together in one place.</p>
<p>So my goal, in addition to building a game in general, was to build a game that was <i>intended</i> to be played by one or two players at most.</p>

<p><b>Hero's Journey Home</b> is a game that begins at the end of a great quest.

<h3>What makes it so fun?</h3>
<p>I'm a big fan of old-school RPGs, but I know I'm not going to be playing one any time soon. Even so, I love the rulebooks, the artwork, and the idea of a group of adventurers surviving a grueling campaign against a bunch of bloodthirsty creatures. That's what I'm trying to capture here in a smaller and more intimate (not that kind of intimate) way.</p>
<p>Here, the gameplay requires you to manage your resources (adventurers, items, spells, and money) with an eye towards a long-term goal (home) in the face of short-term obstacles (monsters and other unfriendly cards). Every choice you make at every stage of the game will help decide if you make it home.</p>
<p>With dice involved there's obviously an element of chance, but I've worked to include methods of escape which don't doom you if you have some bad rolls or happen to meet a powerful enemy early on. A battle that takes you down to almost nothing may be followed by a trip to a palace where you're granted some additional adventurers. It's not all ghouls and harpies!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Do you (me, not <i>you</i>) have what it takes?</h3>
<p>I have everything ready to go, I just need the funds to actually buy the parts and I figured 100 sets was what I could realistically achieve at this point.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What if the goal isn't met?</h3>
<p>No one goes home empty-handed. If I don't hit my stated dollar goal I'll still deliver a game, just not as many as I'd hoped.* If the goal is met, obviously, same deal. If I hit 100 and there's time left, I'll just add more. My final limit is ~200 (unless I hit 200 :0).</p>
<p>* I'm legally required to state that due to unforeseen circumstances, there is a chance the product will not be delivered.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>New perks added!</h3>
<p>I've added two new perks: <b>Sticker Shock!</b> and <b>The Package of Power Plus!</b>. Sticker Shock! is two 3""x3"" black and white vinyl stickers with images of the Skeleton King and Leviathan.

I set a goal for myself for 2014, and that was to build a game from start to finish. I spent most of the year drawing, writing, testing, and sourcing parts, and now I'm ready to put it all together.

<h2 class=""p1"">Who is Mike Bithell?</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Mike Bithell is not a veteran game developer, and is in no way responsible for any of your favourite games. He is not afraid to jump on a bandwagon. He is, however, a game designer who's worked in professional dev for nearly 5 years, and is just about to release his first indie project, Thomas Was Alone. He hates talking about himself in the third person.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h2 class=""p1"">What is Thomas Was Alone? </h2>
<p class=""p1"">Thomas Was Alone is an indie puzzle platformer about friendship and jumping. You guide a group of rectangles through an array of dangerous and puzzling environments to make it to the end. Initially planned for release on PC and Mac, the game is due out in late May / early June.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The game's received some fantastic press already, with very positive previews on Indiegames.com and Hookshot Inc, and coverage on most of the major gaming blogs. It even made The Huffington Post's top 10 anticipated Indie games of 2012.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A couple of previews:</p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://indiegames.com/2012/03/preview_thomas_was_along_mike_.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://indiegames.com/2012/03/preview_thomas_was_along_mike_.html</a></p>

<p class=""p1"">Find out more at <a href=""http://www.thomaswasalone.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thomaswasalone.com</a></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h2 class=""p1"">Why crowdfunding then?</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Thomas is a project I've been working on for a year, balancing it around a full time day job in the games industry. Myself and a couple of awesome collaborators have worked on the game for free, and (fingers crossed) hope to make some money back when we launch. Unfortunately, as we approach the final months of dev, there are a couple of upfront costs we can't avoid.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>We need to record voiceover, we need to pay some legal fees, and we need to cover some marketing costs.</strong> </p>
<p class=""p1"">If this campaign is unsuccessful, I'll take out a loan to cover these costs, but I thought that given the massive appeal of crowdfunding right now, I might give this a go first.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h2 class=""p1"">What do I get for my money?</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Well, love, obviously. But we're prepared that this might not be quite enough for you. For that reason, We've lined up some rewards on the right. You can get a credit at the end of the game, or pay more and get a DRM free copy of the game when it launches (digital download, PC/Mac). I'm also willing to buy you a pint for an extortionate amount of extra cash.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h2 class=""p1"">But I have no money, can I help in another way?</h2>
<p class=""p1"">But of course. Follow me on twitter @mikebithell, and be sure to tweet this page. It's a relatively small amount, so hopefully it can happen. All money earned will go into making the game more awesome!</p></div>","--Update--

Mike Bithell is not a veteran game developer, and is in no way responsible for any of your favourite games. He is not afraid to jump on a bandwagon. He is, however, a game designer who's worked in professional dev for nearly 5 years, and is just about to release his first indie project, Thomas Was Alone. He hates talking about himself in the third person.
 
What is Thomas Was Alone? 
Thomas Was Alone is an indie puzzle platformer about friendship and jumping. You guide a group of rectangles through an array of dangerous and puzzling environments to make it to the end. Initially planned for release on PC and Mac, the game is due out in late May / early June.
The game's received some fantastic press already, with very positive previews on Indiegames.com and Hookshot Inc, and coverage on most of the major gaming blogs. It even made The Huffington Post's top 10 anticipated Indie games of 2012.
A couple of previews:

http://www.hookshotinc.com/thomas-was-alone-a-quadrilaterals-quest/
Find out more at www.thomaswasalone.com
 
Why crowdfunding then?
Thomas is a project I've been working on for a year, balancing it around a full time day job in the games industry. Myself and a couple of awesome collaborators have worked on the game for free, and (fingers crossed) hope to make some money back when we launch. Unfortunately, as we approach the final months of dev, there are a couple of upfront costs we can't avoid.
We need to record voiceover, we need to pay some legal fees, and we need to cover some marketing costs. 
If this campaign is unsuccessful, I'll take out a loan to cover these costs, but I thought that given the massive appeal of crowdfunding right now, I might give this a go first.
 
What do I get for my money?
Well, love, obviously. But we're prepared that this might not be quite enough for you. For that reason, We've lined up some rewards on the right. You can get a credit at the end of the game, or pay more and get a DRM free copy of the game when it launches (digital download, PC/Mac). I'm also willing to buy you a pint for an extortionate amount of extra cash.
 
But I have no money, can I help in another way?
But of course. Follow me on twitter @mikebithell, and be sure to tweet this page. It's a relatively small amount, so hopefully it can happen. All money earned will go into making the game more awesome!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p><a href=""http://quest.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quest Interactive Productions</a> has been running LARP events in the Connecticut area for over 20 years. We focus on high fantasy, especially our <a href=""http://quest.org/cg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">continuing gameworld</a>, which has seen well over a hundred events. If you're new to Quest, check out our <a href=""http://quest.org/newplayer/index.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Player Guide</a> for a more detailed rundown.<br/></p>
<p>Quest has run a fair number of weekend-long events in the past, but renting a site is expensive - and while people don't have to pay admission until the day of game, site fees need to be paid up front. Which brings us here: this campaign is designed to accumulate the necessary funds to run the game, so we can afford to bring you the best possible gaming experience.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What's on the table here?<br/>
</h3> <p>We're aiming for a total of $4000, which is enough to rent the campsite, as well as pay for food and props materials.</p>
<p>For this game, we're hoping to book Camp Cedarcrest, located in Orange, CT. Quest staff have looked over this new site, and it works great for our needs. (Check out the details, and some pictures, <a href=""http://www.campingct.org/facilities.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.) The game will run from Friday evening to Sunday around noon.</p>
<p>The game dates we're looking at are April 22-24, 2016, so save the date!<br/></p>
<p>If just the prospect of having a weekend game isn't enough, we also have some excellent donation rewards!</p>
<p><b>$10</b> gets you a copy of the video game based on <i>The Long Way Home</i>, so even if you can't make it to the event itself, you can share the experience - and if you can, you'll have a replayable reminder of the weekend's shenanigans. The game will be available for PC from <a href=""http://swanprincessgames.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Swan Princess Games</a> in summer 2016, so as to recreate <i>The Long Way Home</i> as it ends up happening live, bizarre war stories and all.</p>
<p><b>$25</b> provides you with a custom in-game bonus in the form of a minor divine blessing. What you get depends on your character's stats and needs, but all will come in handy.<br/></p>
<p><b>$40 </b>donations receive a handmade Quest papercraft bookmark by co-GM Alisha Richman. Take a look at the design below:</p>
<p></p>

Besides the fiscal advantage, it's also easier for GM staff to calibrate challenges if they know who's coming.</p>
<p><b>$125</b>, besides the lower-tier items, adds a bonus Lore sheet available only to Indiegogo sponsors. What secret and forbidden knowledge will be included? That would be telling. But suffice to say that something not even Sages can automatically know is probably <i>extremely</i> forbidden.</p>
<p><b>$150</b> adds the option for a custom holy symbol dedicated to the (Quest) divinity and sect of your choice. If you pick this reward, we'll be in touch with you after the campaign ends to find out your specific request.</p>
<p><b>$300</b> donors will have their character not just appear in <i>The Long Way Home</i> video game, but actively feature as PCs within the game. Haven't you always wanted to be a video game character? You know you have. <i>For obvious logistical reasons, only 6 sponsors can receive this reward.</i></p>
<p><b>$500</b>, our highest rewards tier, provides all the unrestricted lower-tier rewards but also will allow you to take home some of our game-specific props after the event. Do you want your very own [spoiler], [spoiler], or handmade [spoiler]?<br/></p>
<br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Long Way Home<br/>
</h3> <p>Quest's Events Committee has already processed and approved a proposal for <i>The Long Way Home</i>, with GM team Jackie Anderson, Beth Goldgar, and Alisha Richman. For some idea of what to expect (before everything goes horribly wrong), check out the teaser:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Following the successes of previous efforts to tame the northern wilds
of his domain, King Dmitri of Ragnorack has granted a charter for a new
settlement to be established at the edge of the kingdom. The young and
charismatic Lord Friedrich Kieferholt, a younger son of one of King Dmitri's
advisors, led the settlers as they struck out from their staging point in
Marilyna as soon as the snows melted enough for the ground to be clear,
following the shores of Lake Hrungar to what would become the site of their new
settlement.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>To the delight of Lord Kieferholt and his settlers, they discovered a
sheltered and welcoming river valley in the foothills of the Worldspine
Mountains, with fertile soil and ample lumber available from the untamed
forests. There, they carved out a home for themselves, working hard through the
spring and summer to erect homes and clear land for fields. By autumn, the
people of the new colony of Elsbethhalden – named for the second-born daughter
of King Dmitri – had completed the buildings and fortifications needed to
protect them from the harsh Ragnorackan weather and the predations of the
savage creatures known to stalk the northern reaches of the kingdom.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The settlers' preparations saw them through the first harsh winter of
the isolated northern reaches, and their success has encouraged other hopefuls
to relocate to the new lands. In addition, the homesteaders of Elsbethhalden
are now looking beyond mere survival, and seek to create more comforts and
long-term necessities in their new home. To that end, Lord Kieferholt has
announced an open invitation for skilled craftspeople, traders, woodsmen,
guards, and other brave and talented souls to come to Elsbethhalden and aid in
the efforts of the settlers. His Lordship promises that those who come to lend
their hands to the completion of the settlement will be generously compensated
for their hard work.</i></p>
<b>Here's what else we know (and can share):</b> <i>The Long Way Home</i> is a deadly game (as weekend games tend to be), as well as being heavily-plotted and high-action. However, there will be loads of opportunities for any skillset or play preferences.<br/><p>After the crowdfunding campaign concludes, everyone who's paid for registration will be contacted by the GM team to ask about any dietary or medical needs, as well as to check in on some plot-related character choices.</p>
<p><b>Some rules you should know:</b> For anyone considering attending for the first time, Quest has a fairly basic code of conduct. No live steel, real weapons, alcohol, or illegal drugs are permitted at the event. Further, sexual abuse and sexual assault are considered inappropriate topics at a Quest event. Real-world racial and other slurs are also inappropriate and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>All attendees must be 16 years of age or older; anyone under the age of 18 must have a waiver signed by a parent or guardian in order to play. If for whatever reason you are unable to engage in physical combat, Quest has noncombatant rules in place.</p>
<p>If you have any other safety or comfort concerns, info@quest.org will reach the Secretary, who will be happy to check or arrange whatever will help you have a good time. Her happiness is certain, as she is the one writing this sentence.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What if...?<br/>
</h3> <p>What's going to happen if we don't meet our goal? Well, we'll be sad, obviously, but the closer we get to our goal, the more likely we'll be able to cut enough corners to push the game through anyway. Of course, it won't be as awesome as it could be without your help.</p>
<p>On a more cheerful note, Quest as an organization has been running LARP events since 1991. We have solid experience, both in our GM staff and in general. We even have a proposal ready! In short, if we do make our goal, there need be no worry about the game failing to take place, pending unavoidable circumstances, natural disasters, and so forth. Past weekend games have been a lot of fun, controlled chaos and all, and we have every expectation of being able to bring you an equally delightful experience.</p>
<p>And if we exceed our goal? The first stretch goal will be revealed when we reach $3500, so if you want to see what exciting bonuses we've thought of, you know how to make that happen!<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What else can I do?<br/>
</h3>
</div>Don't have money to contribute? Or don't have enough money to commit to registration right away? That's fine with us! Tell your friends, tell their friends, just spread enthusiasm around until some of it sticks!<br/><br/>Pre-registration will be open until a month before the game, so even if you can't pay right now, you're not missing your chance to attend at the reduced price. Contact longwayhome@quest.org at any time to register or ask game-related questions.<br/><br/>Or, if you have more time than money, we can always use NPC staff! Fighters, face characters, and kitchen staff would all be deeply appreciated at any level of experience. Again, contact longwayhome@quest.org if you're interested.<br/></div>","Who Interactive What?

For this game, we're hoping to book Camp Cedarcrest, located in Orange, CT. Quest staff have looked over this new site, and it works great for our needs. (Check out the details, and some pictures, here.) The game will run from Friday evening to Sunday around noon.
The game dates we're looking at are April 22-24, 2016, so save the date!
If just the prospect of having a weekend game isn't enough, we also have some excellent donation rewards!
$10 gets you a copy of the video game based on The Long Way Home, so even if you can't make it to the event itself, you can share the experience - and if you can, you'll have a replayable reminder of the weekend's shenanigans. The game will be available for PC from Swan Princess Games in summer 2016, so as to recreate The Long Way Home as it ends up happening live, bizarre war stories and all.
$25 provides you with a custom in-game bonus in the form of a minor divine blessing. What you get depends on your character's stats and needs, but all will come in handy.
$40 donations receive a handmade Quest papercraft bookmark by co-GM Alisha Richman. Take a look at the design below:

Bookmarks are scheduled to ship January 2016, giving you a pleasant reminder closer to game time.$75 covers your game entry fee, allowing you to pre-register and save $20 off the at-the-door cost of entry. Besides the fiscal advantage, it's also easier for GM staff to calibrate challenges if they know who's coming.
$125, besides the lower-tier items, adds a bonus Lore sheet available only to Indiegogo sponsors. What secret and forbidden knowledge will be included? That would be telling. But suffice to say that something not even Sages can automatically know is probably extremely forbidden.
$150 adds the option for a custom holy symbol dedicated to the (Quest) divinity and sect of your choice. If you pick this reward, we'll be in touch with you after the campaign ends to find out your specific request.
$300 donors will have their character not just appear in The Long Way Home video game, but actively feature as PCs within the game. Haven't you always wanted to be a video game character? You know you have. For obvious logistical reasons, only 6 sponsors can receive this reward.
$500, our highest rewards tier, provides all the unrestricted lower-tier rewards but also will allow you to take home some of our game-specific props after the event. Do you want your very own [spoiler], [spoiler], or handmade [spoiler]?

  The Long Way Home
 Quest's Events Committee has already processed and approved a proposal for The Long Way Home, with GM team Jackie Anderson, Beth Goldgar, and Alisha Richman. For some idea of what to expect (before everything goes horribly wrong), check out the teaser:


Following the successes of previous efforts to tame the northern wilds
of his domain, King Dmitri of Ragnorack has granted a charter for a new
settlement to be established at the edge of the kingdom. The young and
charismatic Lord Friedrich Kieferholt, a younger son of one of King Dmitri's
advisors, led the settlers as they struck out from their staging point in
Marilyna as soon as the snows melted enough for the ground to be clear,
following the shores of Lake Hrungar to what would become the site of their new
settlement.

To the delight of Lord Kieferholt and his settlers, they discovered a
sheltered and welcoming river valley in the foothills of the Worldspine
Mountains, with fertile soil and ample lumber available from the untamed
forests. There, they carved out a home for themselves, working hard through the
spring and summer to erect homes and clear land for fields. By autumn, the
people of the new colony of Elsbethhalden – named for the second-born daughter
of King Dmitri – had completed the buildings and fortifications needed to
protect them from the harsh Ragnorackan weather and the predations of the
savage creatures known to stalk the northern reaches of the kingdom.

The settlers' preparations saw them through the first harsh winter of
the isolated northern reaches, and their success has encouraged other hopefuls
to relocate to the new lands. In addition, the homesteaders of Elsbethhalden
are now looking beyond mere survival, and seek to create more comforts and
long-term necessities in their new home. To that end, Lord Kieferholt has
announced an open invitation for skilled craftspeople, traders, woodsmen,
guards, and other brave and talented souls to come to Elsbethhalden and aid in
the efforts of the settlers. His Lordship promises that those who come to lend
their hands to the completion of the settlement will be generously compensated
for their hard work.
Here's what else we know (and can share): The Long Way Home is a deadly game (as weekend games tend to be), as well as being heavily-plotted and high-action. However, there will be loads of opportunities for any skillset or play preferences.After the crowdfunding campaign concludes, everyone who's paid for registration will be contacted by the GM team to ask about any dietary or medical needs, as well as to check in on some plot-related character choices.
Some rules you should know: For anyone considering attending for the first time, Quest has a fairly basic code of conduct. No live steel, real weapons, alcohol, or illegal drugs are permitted at the event. Further, sexual abuse and sexual assault are considered inappropriate topics at a Quest event. Real-world racial and other slurs are also inappropriate and will not be tolerated.
All attendees must be 16 years of age or older; anyone under the age of 18 must have a waiver signed by a parent or guardian in order to play. If for whatever reason you are unable to engage in physical combat, Quest has noncombatant rules in place.
If you have any other safety or comfort concerns, info@quest.org will reach the Secretary, who will be happy to check or arrange whatever will help you have a good time. Her happiness is certain, as she is the one writing this sentence.

  What if...?
 What's going to happen if we don't meet our goal? Well, we'll be sad, obviously, but the closer we get to our goal, the more likely we'll be able to cut enough corners to push the game through anyway. Of course, it won't be as awesome as it could be without your help.
On a more cheerful note, Quest as an organization has been running LARP events since 1991. We have solid experience, both in our GM staff and in general. We even have a proposal ready! In short, if we do make our goal, there need be no worry about the game failing to take place, pending unavoidable circumstances, natural disasters, and so forth. Past weekend games have been a lot of fun, controlled chaos and all, and we have every expectation of being able to bring you an equally delightful experience.
And if we exceed our goal? The first stretch goal will be revealed when we reach $3500, so if you want to see what exciting bonuses we've thought of, you know how to make that happen!

  What else can I do?

Don't have money to contribute? Or don't have enough money to commit to registration right away? That's fine with us! Tell your friends, tell their friends, just spread enthusiasm around until some of it sticks!Pre-registration will be open until a month before the game, so even if you can't pay right now, you're not missing your chance to attend at the reduced price. Contact longwayhome@quest.org at any time to register or ask game-related questions.Or, if you have more time than money, we can always use NPC staff! Fighters, face characters, and kitchen staff would all be deeply appreciated at any level of experience. Again, contact longwayhome@quest.org if you're interested.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>What type of game is it?</b><div align=""left"">Wicked Love is a western version of an Otome game (a visual novel that combines  elements of romance simulations with some rpg and adventure game mechanics like stat building and mini- games/puzzles). DRM-FREE Copies of the game will definitely be available and I hope to release for Window, iOS, and Ubuntu for Linux, and if greenlighted, Steam. <br/><br/>THIS WILL BE A COMPLETE GAME, it will NOT be released in chapters that you must buy, or pay extra to unlock other story elements. I personally loathe episodic Otome games, and I find it is impossible to immerse myself in the story as a player. <br/>
</div>
</div>
<div align=""left"">
<b><br/>What is the story?
</b>
<p>The player controls Eerie Bones, an eccentric human woman with 
plenty of moxie who mysteriously wakes up in a house called Limbo in the
 captivating underworld city of Tartarus, a city divided into 7 
different districts, each one is heavily plagued by a different sin. 
Without knowing how or why she ended up in Limbo, Eerie finds out she 
only has 100 days to prevent a rather grim fate. You will decide Eerie's
 destiny as you make difficult choices, solve puzzles, and develop 
relationships with the denizens of Tartarus. With 7 different romance 
options (including a same sex option), 21 different endings, and an 
unlockable secret path, plenty of easter eggs, can you uncover the 
mystery surrounding Eerie's fate?</p>
</div>
<div align=""left"">
<p><b>Anything else?</b></p>
<p>Wicked 
Love may have a name that sounds like a cliche' paranormal romance 
novel, but this playful game engages the player in an adventure to 
reflect on the way love, choices, vices, and virtues shape our paths. It is both thoughtful and scandalous. If you enjoy otome games, Catherine or the Persona series, or choose your own adventure novels then this game is for you :D<br/></p>

<br/><h3>-Why I am asking for help- <br/>
</h3>
<h3>The Game skeleton is already completely coded, so there is no 
worries on the game not being completed, as an avid contributor to 
crowdfunding I thought it was imperative before I sought any outside 
investment help that I was in a position where at least I could publish 
the game as is. So no matter what you will see the finished game and the
 release date is set around July at the latest perhaps I can even 
release it earlier. <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>With stretch goals I really would like to make this a unique otome experience by making it much more inclusive and diverse for all pIayers, if I raise enough money I can implement things like a male version of the protagonist, different skin tone options for the main character so that more players can relate to the main character.  If I raised $18,000 I would love to hire an illustrator to do traditional Japanese Anime style character skins so players could play with either the default graphic novel art style characters or more of a lovely traditional bishounen Otome art style. It would provide a new experience to the players and help with the replay value. I would simply release that version with the final game, so with the default game you would also get hot Bishies version. :3<br/>
</h3>
<h3>I need help funding more of the art assets mostly to
 make this game provide the best player experience. The list of things 
that are already completed finished are the following:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>The entire game skeleton including mini games/puzzles has been coded</li>
<li>6 out of the 10 characters have been finished</li>
<li>Most of the soundtrack, I have the background music already licensed and implemented.</li>
<li>6 out of 12 backgrounds</li>
<li>2 out 21 cg scenes</li>
<li>The interface assets (i.e buttons/menus/stat bars) are finished.</li>
<li>The writing/ plots are finished as well as the story branches</li>
</ul>
</h3>
<p>I have hired professional artists from respected companies around the
 world with excellent work history, I did this to insure I would not 
have a team member that would bail on the project during production as 
they are all contracted professionals. I did not do any of the art 
except the interface art as I have been quite busy with the coding. This
 means you will not receive any excuse after this campaign of delays due
 to issues frequently incurred by people who form a project team from 
friends. The budget is for the following:</p>
<p>4 characters x $125 = $500</p>
<p>3 song licenses x $60 = $180</p>
<p>6 backgrounds x $115 = $690</p>
<p>19 CG scenes x $150 = $2,850</p>
<p>Animations (nothing crazy here as that would cost a lot and I am not 
going to ask that on an indie game, but I would love to have an 
animation for the intro) =$800
</p>
<p>Voice acting about 30 minutes for each main character and 15 minutes 
for each non main character character x 10 characters = $4500 
</p>
<p>Publishing fees to different platforms = $400</p>
<p>This comes to a total of $9,920</p>
<p>If the budget is not met that is okay, :D I am still releasing the 
game, I will most likely cut the voice acting down and animation out if 
the budget is smaller.  The most important things are the characters, 
backgrounds, and cgs. <br/></p>

<br/><h3>-The Risks/Challenges- </h3>
<p> To be honest, Wicked Love will be created even without the 
success of the crowdfunding, but without these supporters the scope and 
quality I would love to give players for a more unique gaming experience
 will certainly not be achieved. To me it is very important to gauge a 
game's success by how much fun and entertainment it provides the 
players. To me this project's real success hinges on support. <br/><br/>Unforeseen
 events happen, unlucky things happen, and something unexpected will 
surely occur as this is the game development business, but rest assured I
 am the type of person who doesn't see an obstacle as a lay down and 
play dead moment, but I like the challenge of figuring out a way to 
accomplish something within certain parameters. which is most likely 
from the gamer side of me, or the inner Sherlock fan :D.

What type of game is it?Wicked Love is a western version of an Otome game (a visual novel that combines  elements of romance simulations with some rpg and adventure game mechanics like stat building and mini- games/puzzles). DRM-FREE Copies of the game will definitely be available and I hope to release for Window, iOS, and Ubuntu for Linux, and if greenlighted, Steam. THIS WILL BE A COMPLETE GAME, it will NOT be released in chapters that you must buy, or pay extra to unlock other story elements. I personally loathe episodic Otome games, and I find it is impossible to immerse myself in the story as a player. 



What is the story?

The player controls Eerie Bones, an eccentric human woman with 
plenty of moxie who mysteriously wakes up in a house called Limbo in the
 captivating underworld city of Tartarus, a city divided into 7 
different districts, each one is heavily plagued by a different sin. 
Without knowing how or why she ended up in Limbo, Eerie finds out she 
only has 100 days to prevent a rather grim fate. You will decide Eerie's
 destiny as you make difficult choices, solve puzzles, and develop 
relationships with the denizens of Tartarus. With 7 different romance 
options (including a same sex option), 21 different endings, and an 
unlockable secret path, plenty of easter eggs, can you uncover the 
mystery surrounding Eerie's fate?


Anything else?
Wicked 
Love may have a name that sounds like a cliche' paranormal romance 
novel, but this playful game engages the player in an adventure to 
reflect on the way love, choices, vices, and virtues shape our paths. It is both thoughtful and scandalous. If you enjoy otome games, Catherine or the Persona series, or choose your own adventure novels then this game is for you :D

















-Why I am asking for help- 

The Game skeleton is already completely coded, so there is no 
worries on the game not being completed, as an avid contributor to 
crowdfunding I thought it was imperative before I sought any outside 
investment help that I was in a position where at least I could publish 
the game as is. So no matter what you will see the finished game and the
 release date is set around July at the latest perhaps I can even 
release it earlier. 


With stretch goals I really would like to make this a unique otome experience by making it much more inclusive and diverse for all pIayers, if I raise enough money I can implement things like a male version of the protagonist, different skin tone options for the main character so that more players can relate to the main character.  If I raised $18,000 I would love to hire an illustrator to do traditional Japanese Anime style character skins so players could play with either the default graphic novel art style characters or more of a lovely traditional bishounen Otome art style. It would provide a new experience to the players and help with the replay value. I would simply release that version with the final game, so with the default game you would also get hot Bishies version. :3

I need help funding more of the art assets mostly to
 make this game provide the best player experience. The list of things 
that are already completed finished are the following:
The entire game skeleton including mini games/puzzles has been coded
6 out of the 10 characters have been finished
Most of the soundtrack, I have the background music already licensed and implemented.
6 out of 12 backgrounds
2 out 21 cg scenes
The interface assets (i.e buttons/menus/stat bars) are finished.
The writing/ plots are finished as well as the story branches


I have hired professional artists from respected companies around the
 world with excellent work history, I did this to insure I would not 
have a team member that would bail on the project during production as 
they are all contracted professionals. I did not do any of the art 
except the interface art as I have been quite busy with the coding. This
 means you will not receive any excuse after this campaign of delays due
 to issues frequently incurred by people who form a project team from 
friends. The budget is for the following:
4 characters x $125 = $500
3 song licenses x $60 = $180
6 backgrounds x $115 = $690
19 CG scenes x $150 = $2,850
Animations (nothing crazy here as that would cost a lot and I am not 
going to ask that on an indie game, but I would love to have an 
animation for the intro) =$800

Voice acting about 30 minutes for each main character and 15 minutes 
for each non main character character x 10 characters = $4500 

Publishing fees to different platforms = $400
This comes to a total of $9,920
If the budget is not met that is okay, :D I am still releasing the 
game, I will most likely cut the voice acting down and animation out if 
the budget is smaller.  The most important things are the characters, 
backgrounds, and cgs. 




-To show our appreciation- 
Please check out our perks for contributing, thank you!

 




-The Risks/Challenges- 
 To be honest, Wicked Love will be created even without the 
success of the crowdfunding, but without these supporters the scope and 
quality I would love to give players for a more unique gaming experience
 will certainly not be achieved. To me it is very important to gauge a 
game's success by how much fun and entertainment it provides the 
players. To me this project's real success hinges on support. Unforeseen
 events happen, unlucky things happen, and something unexpected will 
surely occur as this is the game development business, but rest assured I
 am the type of person who doesn't see an obstacle as a lay down and 
play dead moment, but I like the challenge of figuring out a way to 
accomplish something within certain parameters. which is most likely 
from the gamer side of me, or the inner Sherlock fan :D.


 -Other Ways You Can Help- Some people just can't contribute with their pocket paper, but that is okay :D  

Please feel free to get the word out about the campaign (you can use the share tools), I appreciate your time, thank you :3
If anyone desires to contribute artistically via game assets 
(graphics, scenes, animation, music,etc..) you will receive everything 
from the Acedia Perk and be credited. (this help would reduce overall 
asset costs in the budget and make the game even more dynamic, I like 
the combing art styles in a way that is cohesive and engaging (similar 
to graphic novels like Sandman or Fables)
If anyone has the time to spare and is familiar with coding, I coded
 the entire game myself, and would love to ask a few questions.  (this 
would reduce any development fees I might have to place the budget 
towards to enhance the player experience, or fine tune game mechanics)
  In turn I am also very willing to help anyone else if they have questions about creating a game, or digital art. Perhaps if you or a child you know is interested in how to get started, and whatnot. If you have any questions let me know, thanks for taking the time to look at this campaign.",22.0,1,"1 Campaign

No matter who is involved in the construction of a tower, whoever puts the last piece wins that tower.This exciting game of minimalist aesthetics has been endorsed by many experts and fans of boardgames and we now seek your help to launch it into production. The rules are very easy to learn, and as a game with great strategic and tactical depth you will enjoy many hours of fun with friends or family.“Abstract games do not usually win competitions, but when you do find one with this great combination of moves, possibilities, boards, with the simplicity of herimis... Then, you clearly have a winner for the competition.” Teresa Serván (Jury of VI Award of Granollers 2013)Awards: Winner VI award of Granollers 2013, winner Inventure Cloud 2014. 
Rules of the game
2 players  |  15 minutes  |  +12 ageThe goal is to build towers on top of the opponent's bases, the winner is the one with the most bases on the top of the towers at the end of the game. Players can perform one of these actions per turn:Place a base on an empty tile.
Move a base to an adjacent tile on top of an oponent's base (once there is more than one base on a single tile, they cannot be moved).
The game ends when a player can no longer perform any action. Each tower scores 1 point to  the player who placed their base on top of it. The winner will be the one with the most points from 2 rounds.Check extended rules hereComponents: 9 hexagonal tiles, 9 plain bases, 9 engraved bases.Measures: Tiles, 60 x 55 mm. | Diam. bases: 3 of 40mm, 3 of 30mm, 3 of 15 mm.About us

I'm here to ask you kind people for some money, with which I want to open a retro video gaming arcade. </p><p>Our aim is to break down boundaries, and bring gamers from all walks of life, and all abilities, together. From internationally recognised professionals to the new face just starting out and everybody in between. This is the place to come, make friends and achieve your goals. We truly believe that bringing communal gaming out of the bedroom and back into the social environment is the future for the way of life we all love so much. We hope you can join us for the journey ahead.<br/><br/><b>What will be in the Retro Gaming Arcade?</b></p><p>We want our arcade to include all types of gamers and we will have a diverse range of machines. There will be all kinds of gaming consoles from the Megadrive to the N64. We will have a large catalogue of games spanning the last 35 years for customers to play along with regular tournaments and leagues. Every week there will be a dedicated Tekken night and we will have regular nights for classics such as Goldeneye 64 and Mario Cart. We hope to purchase some CITY machines which hold classics such as King Of Fighters 98, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and 3, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike. Along with this we will have lots of classic arcade machines such as Donkey Kong, Tetris, Time Crisis  and sit down Naomi DX’s running titles such as King Of Fighters 2K2, CVS2 and Guilty Gear XXAC. <br/><br/>The amount of machines we have will be as a direct result of how much we can raise so if we can raise over the initial amount then we have more of everyones favourites.</p><p><b>Why a Retro Gaming Arcade?</b></p><p>Ever since I was a child I was fascinated by computer games. I spent most of childhood in my room with my best mate playing all the classics. I want to turn my passion in to a business so I can do this full time.<br/><br/>There is a distinct lack of places where gamers can go and play all their favourite games with their friends, or with complete strangers. People see gamers as people who sit in their house on their own when in actual fact we are very social and love to mingle with others who share their passion of video games. I want to bring all these people together, under one roof for the ultimate gaming experience. </p><p><b>What will the invested money go towards?</b></p><p>The bulk of the money will go on buying gaming machines. Some money will be set aside for the design and look of the arcade too. We will be purchasing numerous tvs, both old type and flatscreen. We will be stocking small amounts of soft drinks and sweets as well as having some hot and cold foods, as we know that countless hours of gaming can leave one feeling hungry! <br/><br/>Our intention is not to make loads of money, but to bring something great to the community. </p><p>If anyone has any suggestions for other rewards then please let us know, we always take comments on board and want to give back something that people will enjoy. Likewise, if anyone would like to know any more information about the project or just have a question then please don't hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter and hopefully you believe in it enough to make a donation.</p><p></p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>Our biggest challenge will be getting all the stock needed to make this a real success. It will require a lot of time going around and collecting games, mostly from individuals who are selling online, for the catalogue we will have in the arcade. But that is nothing that a few weeks searching online won't fix. We believe in this project 110% and no matter what challenges we face, we will beat them.</p><p></p><h3>How You Can Support Retro Gaming Arcade</h3><p>We understand not all of you can contribute to our campaign to open a retro gaming arcade but we'd like to give you some ways that you can help our campaign even if you don't have spare cash.</p><ul>
<li>Social Media<br/>Tweet our campaign out there, Facebook it, whatever you need to do, just share it!</li>
<li>Blog or Write About Us<br/>If you have a website, or you write for a site, blog, or another publication why don't you do a quick write-up of our campaign?</li>
<li>Youtube<br/>Are you a Youtuber? Why not tell folks on Youtube about our campaign?</li>
<li>By sending us any old games or consoles that you no longer use. The more games and consoles we have the less money we need to spend on buying them!</li>

We hope to purchase some CITY machines which hold classics such as King Of Fighters 98, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and 3, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike. Along with this we will have lots of classic arcade machines such as Donkey Kong, Tetris, Time Crisis  and sit down Naomi DX’s running titles such as King Of Fighters 2K2, CVS2 and Guilty Gear XXAC. The amount of machines we have will be as a direct result of how much we can raise so if we can raise over the initial amount then we have more of everyones favourites.Why a Retro Gaming Arcade?Ever since I was a child I was fascinated by computer games. I spent most of childhood in my room with my best mate playing all the classics. I want to turn my passion in to a business so I can do this full time.There is a distinct lack of places where gamers can go and play all their favourite games with their friends, or with complete strangers. People see gamers as people who sit in their house on their own when in actual fact we are very social and love to mingle with others who share their passion of video games. I want to bring all these people together, under one roof for the ultimate gaming experience. What will the invested money go towards?The bulk of the money will go on buying gaming machines. Some money will be set aside for the design and look of the arcade too. We will be purchasing numerous tvs, both old type and flatscreen. We will be stocking small amounts of soft drinks and sweets as well as having some hot and cold foods, as we know that countless hours of gaming can leave one feeling hungry! Our intention is not to make loads of money, but to bring something great to the community. If anyone has any suggestions for other rewards then please let us know, we always take comments on board and want to give back something that people will enjoy. Likewise, if anyone would like to know any more information about the project or just have a question then please don't hesitate to contact us.Thank you for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter and hopefully you believe in it enough to make a donation.Risks and challengesOur biggest challenge will be getting all the stock needed to make this a real success. It will require a lot of time going around and collecting games, mostly from individuals who are selling online, for the catalogue we will have in the arcade. But that is nothing that a few weeks searching online won't fix. We believe in this project 110% and no matter what challenges we face, we will beat them.How You Can Support Retro Gaming ArcadeWe understand not all of you can contribute to our campaign to open a retro gaming arcade but we'd like to give you some ways that you can help our campaign even if you don't have spare cash.
Social MediaTweet our campaign out there, Facebook it, whatever you need to do, just share it!

<p>After much consideration and discussion, we've finally got a stretch goal decided upon- Super Boss. Super Boss will be a slightly reworked version, for your PC.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's Halloween and I can't sit back and watch it go by without a celebration of epic proportions. I've rented the Varnum Armory (See photo below), which is a badass castle with an huge open hall, stage, catwalks, and general awesomeness. Not to mention that the proprietors told me Ghost Hunters were just there filming. Halloween in a haunted castle? Yes please.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Unfortunately I can't pay for the whole thing myself. The amazing venue, snacks, food, a certified bartender, sound, lights, etc. is going to total about $1250. Myself, and co-hosts Jesse Stuckey and Lewis Mai will be contributing $500 to make this happen for you lovely people, but that still leaves us $750 short. Help fund the event by making pledges with tickets as your reward!<br/><br/>I hate even having to charge, and $15 is steep I know. So if we 100 tickets (or raise $1500), we will 'buy' everyone a drink via a drink voucher with every ticket (Must be 21+ to redeem). This way we can still fund the party but give you something extra.  </p>
<p>The venue cost is fixed and known, but the rest are estimates only. If we find ways to reduce the estimated costs, we will use the money to improve the quality of the event (better food, entertainment, etc.)</p>
<p>Breakdown Of Costs: <br/>$650 Venue <br/>$50 Crowdfunding Fees <br/>$50 Plates/Napkins/Utensils/Cups <br/>$150 Food/Drink (Non-Alcoholic) <br/>$150 Decorations <br/>$200 Bartender (TIPS certified bartender required by venue to serve alcohol) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can't get funded by the deadline, then nobody pays the pledge amount, and we'll have to try again next year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Invite your friends and get as many people (that you know please) to buy tickets as you can so we can make this thing happen! Any donations of any of the things we are budgeting for will also help make this happen!</p>
<h3>Perk Eligibility </h3>
<p>Please note that to receive a ticket as a pledge reward, you must be eligible. This means you must be able to attend the event on October 29th, 6pm - 10pm. You must also know a host or someone who is also attending that can vouch for you. We are liable for the venue, which is also a museum, so we reserve the right to deny a ticket or entry. If you aren't sure if you are eligible, feel free to e-mail us first! We will be collecting names for a guest list that will be checked against ID's upon entry.</p>

<p>It's also a perfect complement to Indiegogo or other crowdfunding platforms. You could for example use Indiegogo to raise money to build a really great prototype, or even patent your idea (not that you need to with us), or hire a ghostwriter, or get your song professionally recorded, or have your fashion designed... you name it.

<p>It is an interesting challenge to fully estimate the innovation market size and its growth patterns. As a general guideline, however, we can use data from the US “Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity” to show qualitative trends of growth. The amount of new entrepreneurs has been steadily increasing since 2001 in the US when entrepreneurs created about 4.7 million new business. In 2011—the most recent year for which the US Kauffman Index has data—entrepreneurs created about 6.8 million businesses that year. An increase of 43%! We see that the growth is similar in other markets such as the UK. </p>

Well, one. Sure, we have learned that Indiegogo is not an ideal medium to raise funding for intangible products like websites (though it is great for tangible gadgets and independent films), but we want to say thank you to all our contributors who believed in this page (your contributions have taken us important steps closer), the press who praised us, the firms who put their names behind us, and the people who are supporting us in other ways. 
99.9% of you want to see our site launch, and this campaign has given us invaluable market research, so we're celebrating that! 
We are now looking into more fundraising options, to bring you the world's marketplace to turn your thoughts into things. Thank you again, and please see our closing update here if you'd like more info.

Your Big Idea Can Lead to Big Change – For the World and in Your Pocket. Help Us Make that Happen.Do you have an idea of any kind that you've never been able to get out there due to bureaucracy or prejudice, but that know could make a big difference and big money? If you have, or are a company that embraces innovation, we've got an idea...⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯



❝Hell, there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something❞ – Edison

Due to funding problems, Charles Babbage died before his invention was completed. That invention was the first computer.
For every one we know about, how many more world-changing ideas die away because there isn't a Babbage Jr. or Mrs Babbage to carry on the fight?
Global innovation is being slowed by an estimated 2300% because of this.
The culprits are prejudice and the Patent system which – founded in 15th century Italy – is an archaic, extortionate roadblock to innovation.
The solution to this problem will come through the computer itself...
With your support ""bid-ee-uhs"" will be a revolutionary, private auction website to crowdsource & detect the billion dollar ""Eureka!"" moments of everyday Edisons & Mrs Edisons like you and us, when they're still affordable, and 'blind auction' them confidentially to innovative company buyers in every market - no race or gender roadblocks, and no patent required.And you'll get a lot more than just success in return. Pledge $20 today, get $190 to use at our site. Pledge $35+, get $285! See 'Perks' for more great deals, and pledge now!Usage examples:
You think of a clever company slogan you want to pitch to big ad agencies...
You think of or write an innovative movie idea...
You come up with an amazing toy or game idea...
You write a seriously catchy song...
You invent a baby or mom product that solves a big problem...
You discover a scientific breakthrough or formula...
You create an advanced type of electric car battery...
You have a great idea for a mobile app that could make millions...
...but until now you had no idea where to take it? Let our site turn your thoughts into things!THE SELLER'S PROBLEM: In days of yore when you thought about selling – for example – second hand goods, it meant hoping for the best, using random shop windows and local newspapers, before eBay and Craigslist revolutionized that. Don't you think the laborious way ideas themselves are bought and sold belongs in the past too? $30,000 patents, million-to-one competitions, nerve-wracking TV shows, cold calls, sharks, dragons, unsolicited rejection letters, lawsuits... It's a minefield! Indiegogo is one of the few genuinely fun arenas for innovation out here.So whether you’re an ad-man or soccer mum, writer or composer, architect or father of three, where do all these amazing ideas go? Sadly, often nowhere. You think about them from time to time, try to get them out there, companies refuse to open their door, the ideas just die away, and mother earth loses out. This slows down global innovation. Don't you think that's crazy?THE BUYER'S PROBLEM: And if you were a company, would you rather: 
Use the best idea from your perceptibly ""safe"" in-house team & colleagues, or;
Play it safe until a great idea makes it big, then buy it, but for millions extra, or;

Safely receive the best new idea that day in the world, whilst it's still great value?

We have that solution. Our unique business model and groundbreaking mechanisms solve both conundrums, and rather than drive prices up like a traditional 'auction,' they predict the genetic fingerprint of future game-changers, thus saving the company money while making you a relative small fortune. See ""Our big idea"" below for more on all that in a moment.And let's never forget all the women who have world-changing ideas like those of Mary Anderson (windshield wipers) or Stephanie Kwolek (Kevlar), but whose innovations instead died away because they faced gender roadblocks in male-led industries. We want to create one level playing field to turn every human being's thoughts into things, via one friendly interface.And crucially, the whole process will take place whilst protecting both parties equally through a legally watertight confidentiality agreement, and a few trade secret special twists (they're our special sauce). Furthermore, unlike the public offerings on eBay, ours is a private portal where only the top companies we hand pick will be able to view your idea.We'll be working with top L.A. copyright and entertainment law firm, Lowe & Associates.Remember, companies already engage in blind 'auctions' every day – from film script bidding wars to inventors shopping round their ideas for the best deal. We securely tidy that process up for the good of all, without it even seeming like an auction, because companies must innovate better and cheaper to win big, and the key to that is your big idea.

❝Innovative companies .. understand innovation never happens in a vacuum .. are not afraid to break with the norm and push past conventional wisdom that causes people to think in a box.❞

– Rebecca Bagley, Forbes




❝A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.❞
– JFKJust like crowdfunders get ideas cheap by supporting them early, so can companies. And your mind is amazing! We know that you have that world-changing idea within you, that you'd rather not start your own company to sell. Especially when there's already a perfectly good company out there that could buy it. Nobody needs that much company.

❝...but now, corporate America is reaching out to the independent inventor .. You’ve got successful kid inventors .. grandmothers and everybody in between.❞

– United Inventors Association

❝The patent system is broken❞

– The Verge, Daily Tech, & many more
Transceive ideas privately with buyers in the world's new secure inno-bubble.The patent system is largely unchanged since it began in 15th century Italy. The Internet is amazing. Why haven't the two been effectively linked yet? Recent studies show the average cost of the 5% of infringements that don't settle out of court is actually $1 million per case.Yes, the copyright systems are decrepit and being abused. But out of the flames of the old, imagine what our world will be like if world-class organizations could tap safely into the innovation stream of all the world's ideas through a global 'one-stop-shop'. With your pledge we'll no longer have to imagine. ❝The small-time inventor appears to be making something of a comeback .. A surprising number of those pursuing better mousetraps .. are still garage and bedroom tinkerers.❞

– Mike Brunker, NBC

So this is the private idea crowdsourcing portal being built for the people. That's why we're coming to Indiegogo. We have to raise funds to complete the website, app, and our team, so it can partly be built by the people. Our founders know from experience that having to answer to big bucks investors often leads to a stifled, boxed in product, and we're all about thinking outside the box. We hope you agree.Great companies need great ideas.People with great ideas need great companies.Who are open and innovative enough to listen.Help us disrupt antiquated systems of stuffy rubber stamps and certificates you put in a frame, following practices from the 15th century. It's really starting to show (–Electronic Frontier Foundation). Because when that flood of new stuff appears via our site, it will quickly feel like we're living in the 22nd century.⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
THE SOLUTION: You could think of this also as a sort of 'online dating' that happily marries innovators to companies. If Cupid can use a helping hand, why can't Genius?The site and app will be a secure, private, bid-and-auction marketplace for you to get that idea in your head, sold, simply and quickly. Keep reading to find out how.❝It's not clear that we really need patents in most industries ... It's a problem.❞– Federal Judge Richard A. Posner (Reuters)

We agree, Judge. Where there’s a problem, there can be a solution. Welcome to our big idea!Companies' fear of being sued if they let you show them your ""Eureka!"" moment is an outdated, false economy that loses them an innovative edge, and therefore money. And if they're losing money, so are you. So our big idea includes a groundbreaking umbrella of review and detection mechanisms that will clear the long-standing, fossilizing hurdles – and ours are patent pending for what it's worth, so yours don’t have to be. 'It just works.' More on that in a second...Furthermore companies already work with old-school brokers every day, as do innovators with agents. With us as the secure hi-tech broker and agent in one, the need for such early red tape and bureaucracy that officials like Judge Posner criticizes, falls elegantly away. Goodbye old friend.We do this using a special, patent pending (rather ironically) combination of NDAs, defensive publication, tracked company clicks, and trade secret law. Click here for a Wikipedia ""Patent"" article that discusses just some of that in more depth. We realized that, by trading your idea in our watertight bubble – with only companies who have signed our unique confidentiality contract – we could remove the need for an 'up-front' patent that would protect you from nothing yet choke your purse-strings, and instead let the resourceful company obtain the idea safely first, and the expensive patent second, if at all. And the same goes for other forms of copyright.
Just like digital was the future of photography, we believe crowdsourcing is the future of innovation. We want big companies and your big ideas to be part of that future, rather than a 'Polaroid' of the world that fails to innovate, and like a photo, fades away...⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
We will finally give your big idea wings, while you're still in your PJs. Here's where the magic happens!:




Upload your big idea!As much or as little of it to the private, secure area of our site. (See FAQ for categories.)


Pick its sector!And pay an all-in-one fee, from just $10 - $95 depending on the sector. (Though we'd love to do it for nothing, we believe the industry expert opinions you'll receive, plus taking days of pitching work off your hands, has value.)


Stay safeBy agreeing to our special and unique Terms & Conditions that - with a few clever and novel twists - protect both parties equally.


Sit back, get fingerprinted & rated!Included in the small fee, our hand-picked panel of Industry Experts in each sector queue then analyze and rate your submission based on a number of factors (some of which stay behind-the-scenes). Our mechanisms then generate a likelihood score (out of 5 stars or 100%) as to whether your idea has the genetic fingerprint of later success on its early seed. Magic! This rating alone gives you invaluable feedback + market research as to your idea's viability.


Sent!We queue then privately send your idea directly to the inboxes of only those company's buyers, in that same category, who fit with receiving that success-star rating of idea or higher. Crucially company buyers only ever receive 1 such email per day, max. (They love this.)


SOLD!Those companies can then exchange as much more info/prototypes with you as needed – if any – and place their one 'best offer' to hopefully secure the rights to your big idea and their next. The 'blind auction' means nobody knows what each company has bid except you. Then just like in real world deals, the best offer wins. Simples.

It's that simple. Speculate to accumulate, #AuctionYourEurekas, then cash out, all without having to pick up the phone. And the companies win big too, with a broader spectrum of 5-star ideas at their e-doorstep, just once a day.

This is our big idea. Please PLEDGE and SHARE now, so we can help you sell yours. Because the clock is ticking before someone else comes up with your idea and profits from it instead (we know, we've been there). If you start, others will follow, so show the world what an innovator you are.

The value proposition promotes a rare but genuine win-win-win situation for all parties:Summary of how each party benefits:Companies:
Get access to the next big thing at a cut cost price to them (still a small fortune to the creator)
Retain their innovative competitive edge over their competition
Creatives:
Get to market their brainwave without the expense of antiquated legal protections
Get to cash out on their big idea without the stress of having to start their own company (because the above company is already a company!)

It's also a perfect complement to Indiegogo or other crowdfunding platforms. You could for example use Indiegogo to raise money to build a really great prototype, or even patent your idea (not that you need to with us), or hire a ghostwriter, or get your song professionally recorded, or have your fashion designed... you name it. Then, after your campaign closes, you can move the results onto our site for expert rating and to be opened up to secure bidding.

Either way, we know this will revolutionize the world of innovation, just as eBay revolutionized the antiques market, and sites including Indiegogo have revolutionized the market for raising capital. That's why you're here.⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯We did our due diligence in buckets. (Not literally, that would be weird.)

❝We wake up inventing (breakfast bacon chips – Patent No. 6,699,520) and go to bed inventing (arm pillow – Patent No. 6,691,353).❞ – Mike Brunker, NBC
It is an interesting challenge to fully estimate the innovation market size and its growth patterns. As a general guideline, however, we can use data from the US “Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity” to show qualitative trends of growth. The amount of new entrepreneurs has been steadily increasing since 2001 in the US when entrepreneurs created about 4.7 million new business. In 2011—the most recent year for which the US Kauffman Index has data—entrepreneurs created about 6.8 million businesses that year. An increase of 43%! We see that the growth is similar in other markets such as the UK. 



❝This is an extraordinarily inventive age.❞ – Arthur Molella, Smithsonian Institution

It's also an extraordinarily open age for innovative companies. Entrepreneurism is alive and well around the world, and with the recession and the unfortunate job cuts, more so than ever. We want to help. And due to the rapidly expanding market there is no reason why it will not grow to become the next big Internet friendly giant, to rival those such as eBay.

He knows his mission and he will put all his effort to neutralise the enemy. The Colonel will send him on various missions, both funny and dangerous. The outcome of those missions depends on you – the player.The amount of detail contained in each of the missions, the different types of animations, deaths, explosions and traps make John Mambo an experience you will want to play again and again.As pledgers, not only will you get rewards but you will see John Mambo fully realised as we imagined it! It's always more fun if a pal can help you out. We’ve introduced a cooperative mode so you can play with your friends! A second soldier will be able to accompany you in such difficult tasks but be aware, friendly fire and the decisions you both make will affect the course of the mission... and maybe even your friendship? We all know how much you love high scores!Do you miss the difficulty of classic retro games? We do and that is why John Mambo is an exacting experience. And if that's not enough, John Mambo has a Nightmare mode where the difficulty level is set to extreme. You will need to bandage your fingers when playing!             Who is John Mambo? John Mambo is not the kind of guy you want to stumble across while taking a piss in the jungle. He’s a loose cannon and he’s not to be trusted. But he’s also a hero. OUR hero. YOUR hero. The hero the world needs right now.John Mambo lives for DANGER. Think you’re tough? John Mambo eats bullets for breakfast! You do not want to get in his way, especially when he’s holding a machine gun. Actually, you do not want to get in his way EVER. He’ll take you out, and I don’t mean for dinner. And if he did take you out for dinner, he’d NEVER call you again. He’s got more important things to worry about… like GUNS! And not getting shot by them. Though, if he did, he probably wouldn’t care.He’s a man on a mission. A mission to blow sh*t up! Sometimes he’ll even save the local villagers, though most of the time he’ll blow them up too because they just slow him down. Our goal is simple, give John Mambo more guns. And grenades. And bombs. But ammo isn’t cheap. That’s why we need your help!John Mambo likes to work alone, he’s a lone wolf. But it’s dangerous out there for a wolf without his pack. And that’s why we need your pledges! We want to give John Mambo a co-op partner! Because every guy needs his bro!              With your help we can bring John Mambo into your life! And who wouldn’t want that? Punch the bad guys. Shoot the bad guys. Blow up the bad guys. Kill the bad guys. DESTROY THEM. DESTROY THEM ALL!We want to bring you more levels. More detail. More action. And more bullets. But MAINLY more John Mambo.                John Mambo cares not for financial planning. However, behind every hero there is a base of operations. Yes a lot of the budget goes into ammunition, helicopters and clean-up patrols. If we were to make a pie chart it would be made of meat, pastry and various herbs and spices. But if we were to make a financial budgeting pie chart it would look like this:               This is a question we hear a lot of villagers cry.“Why John Mambo?! Why?!”There’s a simple answer. Because John Mambo is the hero that everybody needs. They just don’t know it yet.If you want a couch co-op, arcade style, bullet injected action adventure, then look no further. This is it. This is the game for you. The only game. You will never be the same again after John Mambo comes into your life. Help us unleash in to the world. No one can take him down. Not even Chuck Norris. Okay,  maybe Chuck Norris.When the world sinks into the seemingly endless twilight of boredom, John Mambo will rise like a phoenix from the ashes of his enemies and Blow. Everything. To hell.                       We’ve been here since the start. Since the day John was born. We remember it well, he came into the world holding a gun and smoking a cigar. It was beautiful.We were there when he destroyed the villages, when he blew up the tanks, when he saved the civilians, when he accidentally shot the civilians, and when he blew it all up. We were there. We’ve been there for the highs - defeating the bosses - and the lows… when he lost it all, and died. We were there because without us, and without you, there would be no John Mambo.                f you can’t donate for any reason, just talk about John Mambo to your friends. Share this page.

<p>Hi everyone! Sam here! I would like to introduce you to this campaign of mine.</p>
<p>In the past few years, as a hobby, I have been working on a fantasy game word, creating the rules for the world, its inhabitants and stories of events occurring in it. One of these stories is The Last Student of Magic, a story of how this world ceased to exist, told from the perspective of a young wizard.</p>
<p>I'm a developer and as such I spent most of my free time working on the mechanic for this game, transferring the rules of the imagined world from paper to an actual game world inside Unity game engine.</p>
<p>One great example for this is the Adaptive AI system I have been working on for 3 years. As a smart, challenging and adaptive AI was the core requirement to make a unique world which adapts to the player, offering each and every player the ability to create his/her own story.</p>
<p>Over the past 5 years I managed to finish a great part of the game logic (AI, Spell crafting, casting and advancing system, Realms System, Puzzles, Story/Dialogues, Unique Save and Death System, Loot/Inventory System, ...) with the missing part being the visuals and sounds.</p>
<p>The Last Student of Magic is a immersive fantasy RPG, taking place underground and other small enclosed realms with all sorts of environments and creatures. And because of the scale, the amount of visual assets needed is huge, and not something a small budget game can handle.</p>
<p>Because of that I have split the game in multiple Chapters, with <strong>Chapter 1 being the first 5 levels of the game, a subset of creatures and 2-3 small realms (sub levels).</strong><br/><br/><strong>This campaign is meant to secure funds for the needed 3D models and audio assets, so we can release the 1st Chapter and get the initial feedback, exposure and hopefully also additional funds to continue with the next chapters.</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ajimal (M) &amp; Nimla(F)</i></p>
<p>The game starts with a cut-scene of a story book, read out loud by a old man's voice, introducing the player to the game world with some history.</p>
<p>The book starts with introducing the world called <strong><i>Almez</i></strong> a place inhabited by all sorts of different lifeforms and filled with mystic energy called <strong>Acinris</strong>.</p>
<p>By mastering that same energy, the human race came out as the dominating species. Mastering this energy was called Magic and the human species discovered two ways of doing so: Some had the ability to absorb the energy around them and store it inside their bodies, and with the use of special Magic circles they would use that energy to do their bidding. The other group has much better control over the energy flow, but couldn't absorb and store any of it in their bodies; however this enhanced control made it possible for them to use and control the energy stored in the crystals called <strong><i>Kupus</i></strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475492866/d3am5elxpixdfm1ftip7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But there would be a rare case where someone would be born with both of these abilities, allowing them to reach an unimaginable level of control over the energy <i>(like <strong>Ajimal </strong>&amp; <strong>Nimla</strong>)</i>.</p>
<p>In all previous conflicts between the races, only thanks to these masters, the human race would come out victorious. However, in the recent history, there was a war, not amongst species; this time all the species united against a dark force which came out of nowhere and swept across the land devouring everything on its path. As a last effort to stop this enemy, all the species formed a single force to match the darkness. The battle went on for days, weeks and months. In the middle of the battle a huge explosion happened which erased both forces, without a trace left.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Nimla (F)</i></p>
<p>In that war, many master of magic disappeared, including <strong><i>Rimas</i></strong><i> (Nimal's uncle)</i>, the young but already powerful protege of that time. To this day, two decades later, no one knows what caused the explosion, however the dark force never appeared again.</p>
<p>Now the book closes and shows a old man <i>(Nimal's grandfather)</i> reading it to two children <i>(<strong>Ajimal</strong> &amp; <strong>Nimla </strong>at the age of 10)</i>. He tells them that they are the new generation of magicians. To achieve that, they should join The Faculty of Magic, where they will learn to master the basics of magic before going out on an Adventure to fully master the control of <strong>Acinris</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years; the player is showing the entrance of the <strong>Central Tower</strong> <i>(The main building of the Faculty of Magic, where the final training and exams are held)</i>. The two characters are standing in front, discussing how this is their last step in mastering the basics of magic before going on a new adventure together.</p>
<p>The following scene blurs out and the player sees their character breaking out of a spell capsule, in a dark room, disoriented. The last thing the player remembers is standing beside their friend.</p>
<p>Soon the player finds himself in an underground training room of the faculty, noticing that something is wrong. The surroundings look like many years have passed; everything was damaged, covered in moss and dust.</p>

<p>You are the main protege of this story. At the very start you get to choose  your main character (boy/girl) which will have some effects on the story.</p>
<p>Your goal is to find your way back to the surface and on the way master the magic and it's elements. You start in a dark room leading to a training room, which is still somewhat functional and will lead you trough the basics of using the controls in the game <i>(an integrated tutorial)</i>. You will be taught about new stuff as you come across it the first time.</p>
<p>On your way back to the top you will come across puzzles to solve, you will encounter creatures (friendly or aggressive). In most cases it depends on your previous actions what kind of creatures your will encounter. Don't act hastily; do not attack everything on your way, you will only make it harder for yourself instead of finding allies to help you. Think. As you progress you will recover pieces of your memory, which will help you understand what happened. That will be the key to either your success or death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-Choice</strong></p>
<p>All the choices you make, including the choice of character, will have an impact on the story. Choices you make can alternate the ending.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-AI</strong></p>
<p>Most of the creatures are using my self-learning AI and as such they are improving throughout the gameplay. Creatures of the same species are sharing the AI, resulting in the sharing of experience between them. That being said, it is not recommended to stick to just one tactic, it may not work out well in the next encounter.<br/>As the AI improves, your allies will be able to help you more efficiently, and your enemies will use it to crush you to the ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-Space rings</strong></p>
<p>Small artifacts which have a small space-time realms integrated into them. They are used to store items. The time inside is frozen, so it is also a perfect place to store food for infinite time. They are the perfect inventories to carry stuff around. You will find different rings in the game with different space sizes and limitations to what type of items can be stored inside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-Realm </strong><b>artifacts</b></p>
<p>These artifacts are created by the most powerful of mages. Just like the space rings, they have a space-time realm sealed inside but with less limitations and a much bigger space. If you have the key integrated into your soul, you can enter and leave such realms freely. But be warned, you never know what you will encounter inside, as the time flow is different from the outside world. Only when someone with the soul key enters, the time flow will stabilize and match the outside world, just to revert back to it's previous state upon your leave. You could find someone you know inside one of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-Shadow creatures</strong></p>
<p>Most creatures will be found at predefined places, which are best suited for them, unlike the shadow creatures, who are living in the shadows and can appear in any space at any given time. The shadow creatures are controlled by a special AI constantly watching the player from the shadows, and will spawn creatures of different types at different times. This is affected by the play style and some of the choices the player made. The only goal of the shadow is your death, so be prepared and watch your shadow.<br/>*This feature also contributes greatly to a unique experience for each player.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-Spells and elements</strong></p>
<p>As you learn new spells and gain control over the power of elements, new paths open. You are free to combine spells and elements to create your unique spells set fitting your playing style. Create great combos using two or more elements to boast the effectiveness of your spells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- <strong>Free exploration</strong></p>
<p>The underground is a sealed place, having mostly a linear design. Depending on the players choices, the game can have a few different paths which intersect at different spots. However, all paths end at the same spot.</p>
<p>You are free to go back and forth in the underground, discovering secret places, accessing areas which you weren't able to access with your magic skills at that time. </p>
<p>Find the Realm artefacts and gain access to new areas with new and unique challenges waiting for you inside. It is also a beautiful place to take a break, refill your energy and work on your spells.</p>

Hi everyone! Sam here! I would like to introduce you to this campaign of mine.
In the past few years, as a hobby, I have been working on a fantasy game word, creating the rules for the world, its inhabitants and stories of events occurring in it. One of these stories is The Last Student of Magic, a story of how this world ceased to exist, told from the perspective of a young wizard.
I'm a developer and as such I spent most of my free time working on the mechanic for this game, transferring the rules of the imagined world from paper to an actual game world inside Unity game engine.
One great example for this is the Adaptive AI system I have been working on for 3 years. As a smart, challenging and adaptive AI was the core requirement to make a unique world which adapts to the player, offering each and every player the ability to create his/her own story.
Over the past 5 years I managed to finish a great part of the game logic (AI, Spell crafting, casting and advancing system, Realms System, Puzzles, Story/Dialogues, Unique Save and Death System, Loot/Inventory System, ...) with the missing part being the visuals and sounds.
The Last Student of Magic is a immersive fantasy RPG, taking place underground and other small enclosed realms with all sorts of environments and creatures. And because of the scale, the amount of visual assets needed is huge, and not something a small budget game can handle.
Because of that I have split the game in multiple Chapters, with Chapter 1 being the first 5 levels of the game, a subset of creatures and 2-3 small realms (sub levels).This campaign is meant to secure funds for the needed 3D models and audio assets, so we can release the 1st Chapter and get the initial feedback, exposure and hopefully also additional funds to continue with the next chapters.
Chapter 1 - Planned release is December 2017

 

The Last Student of Magic is a story of a young wizard, an adventure in the underground and the search for the truth of what happen with the world and the loved ones.

Ajimal (M) & Nimla(F)
The game starts with a cut-scene of a story book, read out loud by a old man's voice, introducing the player to the game world with some history.
The book starts with introducing the world called Almez a place inhabited by all sorts of different lifeforms and filled with mystic energy called Acinris.

However, in the recent history, there was a war, not amongst species; this time all the species united against a dark force which came out of nowhere and swept across the land devouring everything on its path. As a last effort to stop this enemy, all the species formed a single force to match the darkness. The battle went on for days, weeks and months. In the middle of the battle a huge explosion happened which erased both forces, without a trace left.

Nimla (F)
In that war, many master of magic disappeared, including Rimas (Nimal's uncle), the young but already powerful protege of that time. To this day, two decades later, no one knows what caused the explosion, however the dark force never appeared again.

Soon the player finds himself in an underground training room of the faculty, noticing that something is wrong. The surroundings look like many years have passed; everything was damaged, covered in moss and dust.


Ajimal Ajibibah(M) & Nimla Cispus(F)
Here starts their new adventure in the underground of uncovering the truth and gaining back their memories piece by piece in the attempt to reach the surface.
On their way back they will come across all sort of creatures (friendly or hostile, this will mostly depend on their actions), magic artifacts, and a lot of challenges blocking their path. There is not one solution, but multiple.
Discover what happens to you, your family and friends, and how you ended up in this situation as you reach back to the surface.

However, in the recent history, there was a war, not amongst species; this time all the species united against a dark force which came out of nowhere and swept across the land devouring everything on its path.
As a last effort to stop this enemy, all the species formed a single force to match the darkness. The battle went on for days, weeks and months. In the middle of the battle a huge explosion happened and erased both forces, without a trace left.

To this day, two decades later, no one knows what caused the explosion, however the dark force never appeared. Hundreds of years passed and the life returned back to normal.
 

You are the main protege of this story. At the very start you get to choose  your main character (boy/girl) which will have some effects on the story.
Your goal is to find your way back to the surface and on the way master the magic and it's elements. You start in a dark room leading to a training room, which is still somewhat functional and will lead you trough the basics of using the controls in the game (an integrated tutorial). You will be taught about new stuff as you come across it the first time.
On your way back to the top you will come across puzzles to solve, you will encounter creatures (friendly or aggressive). In most cases it depends on your previous actions what kind of creatures your will encounter. Don't act hastily; do not attack everything on your way, you will only make it harder for yourself instead of finding allies to help you. Think. As you progress you will recover pieces of your memory, which will help you understand what happened. That will be the key to either your success or death.
 
-Choice
All the choices you make, including the choice of character, will have an impact on the story. Choices you make can alternate the ending.
 
-AI
Most of the creatures are using my self-learning AI and as such they are improving throughout the gameplay. Creatures of the same species are sharing the AI, resulting in the sharing of experience between them. That being said, it is not recommended to stick to just one tactic, it may not work out well in the next encounter.As the AI improves, your allies will be able to help you more efficiently, and your enemies will use it to crush you to the ground.
 
-Space rings
Small artifacts which have a small space-time realms integrated into them. They are used to store items. The time inside is frozen, so it is also a perfect place to store food for infinite time. They are the perfect inventories to carry stuff around. You will find different rings in the game with different space sizes and limitations to what type of items can be stored inside.
 
-Realm artifacts
These artifacts are created by the most powerful of mages. Just like the space rings, they have a space-time realm sealed inside but with less limitations and a much bigger space. If you have the key integrated into your soul, you can enter and leave such realms freely. But be warned, you never know what you will encounter inside, as the time flow is different from the outside world. Only when someone with the soul key enters, the time flow will stabilize and match the outside world, just to revert back to it's previous state upon your leave. You could find someone you know inside one of them.
 
-Shadow creatures
Most creatures will be found at predefined places, which are best suited for them, unlike the shadow creatures, who are living in the shadows and can appear in any space at any given time. The shadow creatures are controlled by a special AI constantly watching the player from the shadows, and will spawn creatures of different types at different times. This is affected by the play style and some of the choices the player made. The only goal of the shadow is your death, so be prepared and watch your shadow.*This feature also contributes greatly to a unique experience for each player.
 
-Spells and elements
As you learn new spells and gain control over the power of elements, new paths open. You are free to combine spells and elements to create your unique spells set fitting your playing style. Create great combos using two or more elements to boast the effectiveness of your spells.
 
- Free exploration
The underground is a sealed place, having mostly a linear design. Depending on the players choices, the game can have a few different paths which intersect at different spots. However, all paths end at the same spot.
You are free to go back and forth in the underground, discovering secret places, accessing areas which you weren't able to access with your magic skills at that time. 
Find the Realm artefacts and gain access to new areas with new and unique challenges waiting for you inside. It is also a beautiful place to take a break, refill your energy and work on your spells.

Mariano Ruiz has been working with a number of music projects for years, and to get Kofi’s own music identity, he’s based it on soundtracks from sagas like Zelda, Final Fantasy, Skyrim or many other RPG from the 16-bit era, which has resulted in an interesting mix of musical concepts with a retro style that will perfectly accompany the moments of humor and action. </p>

You’ll control Kofi, a weak, lazy and unlucky videogame character that will be followed by a group of interesting (and pathetic) characters aiding him to live a great adventure.The videogame introduces a world of comic fantasy in which the characters are aware of being part of a videogame. Kofi is an RPG character that spends his days lazing around without leveling up. His game is a total mess and every character around him plays better.Features

RTS troop control. Real-time group management. Control your own army.
Captains with special skills.

Find or buy weapons and equipment that allows you to improve your characters; multiple enemies with different qualities: find the best strategy to win.
An adventure full of humor and exciting all the same that talks about a beginner adventurer’s road to self-improvement, and the importance of teamwork. With loads of surreal situations and unforgettable characters.

Explore a big map with different environments (forests, houses, caves, mountains, water areas…). Find chests with unique weapons, funny side quests or simply discover new details about Kofi's world through characters’ stories or written texts.
More than 60 different enemies.
Interaction with characters or elements of the stage. Many of the elements of the stage can be selected or destroyed (bushes, rocks…).

Fully functional game console. You can get some retro games to play if you can find them at sidequests.
Thousands of voiced lines for each language (English and Spanish).
GameplayIn this adventure, Kofi will recieve a war horn. If you sound the horn, your soldiers will know it's time to show up. Defeating enemies will give you motivation points (the more points you gather, the more allies you can call). Each combat unit has a motivation cost based on their value in battle. Motivation is the main theme in this game: you need motivation to psyche up your buddies and reach great goals together. Campaign and exploringYour camp (""the Shelter"") will be your gathering point. It’s where all the characters you recruit for your army will wait for you. You can talk to them and get them ready for a quest. Every time you want to resume the main campaign, you can go to a new quest and thus continue the game story.When you finish a new segment of the campaign, you can choose between continuing right away or freely exploring the map you’ve unlocked thus far in search of gold, treasures or side quests.Your armyEnemiesIn the game you’ll find over 60 different enemies. Before taking on one, it’s important that you assess the way it acts as well as its type of damage and defense. The objective is to offer a wide variety so that the player will always be on guard and learning something new every time they reach new regions.As you discover new enemies, they will all be recorded in a notebook and you’ll be able to check a file with additional information.Equipment and itemsThe game contains some RPG concepts in order to custom and improve your army. Weapons, armor and stupid and funny newbie items will affect your characters’ stats. You can see your characters equipment all time, during gameplay and at cutscenes. There are many weapons and objects scattered around the game. Find them all will be a challenge only suitable for great explorers.Retro consoleThere's a fully functional game console in Kofi's house. You can get some retro games to play if you can find them at sidequests.AwardsReferencesWhen creating Kofi's world, the biggest influences were the universes of Zelda and Warcraft, and some of these influences are quite represented in Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD gameplay and art. There is also a strong influence from Monkey Island saga, Kingdom Rush saga,  Munchkin card game, Adventure Time or Undertale.PlatformsWe're working on both the PC version and, for the next year, the Nintendo Switch port. With more support maybe we can bring the game to more console platforms or computer systems.LanguagesWe have worked really hard to put voice to the game in both English and Spanish. We would like to translate the game to more languages (text only), but the script is extensive and we would require a lot of support to be able to do it. If we get enough support, our priorities would be German, Russian and Chinese, although in the future would like to go for even more languages, such as French or Japanese. Please, contact us telling us what language you would like to see Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD in in the future!StoryKofi is a character from an RPG game. He spends his days lazing around and hasn’t even made it past level 10. Kofi goes to his instructor to ask for help improving and gets gifted with a summoning skill as an attempt to motivate him to keep pressing forward in the game. Kofi’s summon’s name is Lime, a slime that happens to have zero motivation and be even lazier than him, and that would rather nest himself in the couch in a valiant attempt at doing nothing together than help him progress.Your game starts in the region of Neighborwood. That’s where Kofi lives. Neighborwood is an ideal region for beginner mercebinaries, although it has birthed some powerful ones, too. It’s full of forests and mountains.Kofi doesn’t tend to leave Neighborwood because he never has a big quest to attend to. Maybe Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD will be a great chance to live a big adventure and discover new regions...While Kofi and the kids from Startville are enjoying their quiet and boring lives, they happen upon a mysterious guy dressed in red claiming to have lost a bottle. The kids of the Shelter and Kofi undertake this quest thinking it will be easy, but things will not quite go as expected... Voice actingIt’s important to take a minute in this point, since it’s a part of the game in which we’re investing a great deal of effort. A team of more than 10 actors and actresses voice dozens of characters. We’ve paid careful attention to each of the voiced lines, which are in the thousands.We have worked with a team of actors and everything has been recorded in a professional studio, paying close attention to the editing of each audio track.It should be noted that in Kofi’s world not all characters have the privilege of having been given a voice. It’s a recurring gag. Not all characters are voiced (some NPC don't), but all that are will speak in all of their scenes, no matter how unimportant they may be.  Campaign ItemsMore about Kofi Quest: Alpha MODFactionsHumans. Many mercebinaries are humans, but careful! Not all of them. Human mercebinaries tend to be independent, very self-centered, searching for gold, new weapons or leveling up. They’re always willing to live great adventures to tell them in the tavern at the end of the day. Elves. Elves tend to be perfectionists and word is, they generally handle their game properly. Usually, they know how to get gold and are more polite and well-behaved than humans. Orcs. Most orcs gather in tribes and tend to work as enemy characters, but a number of them live quite normally among other factions, such as humans or elves, and word is that they are generally good at managing their own businesses. Scales. The scales live in aquatic regions (and being the good aquatic creatures that they are, they fail to die when falling in water). Their warriors are strong and fast swimmers, although their NPC live quiet lives and don’t strengthen their muscles because they don’t tend to move around all that much. Or at all. There are more factions in Kofi’s world and in Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD, we’ve only shown some of them.CharactersOne of the most interesting aspects of Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD is the amount of characters you will find. Here we show you some of them.Kofi (the noob). Not the strongest warrior around, but… but nothing, really. His sword is half broken, and if worse comes to worst you can throw stones at your enemy or run away (spoiler alert: not the fastest guy around, either).Lime (the slime). He’s Kofi’s first summon. Instead of going out to fight, he’d rather spend the day eating snacks and playing video games. He’s rude, untrusting, lazy, slow and always willing to bring morale down whenever someone wants to do something, but at least his body is explosive and can deal great damage to his enemies (and to his friends).Wargo (the dire wolf). He’s Kofi’s second summon. He’s fast, strong and has incredible ice powers…which is why he doesn’t yet follow Kofi’s commands as much as he’d like.Instructor (the instructor). He’s in charge of managing the quests of all the mercebinaries assigned to him (and there are quite a few of them). He’s always scolding Kofi for his apathetic attitude. All of his free time goes towards online games and parties.Gratt and Rodt (two strong mercebinaries). They’re two powerful, inseparable mercebinaries. Kofi looks up to them as an unreachable goal, especially when they meet in the tavern and Rodt and Gratt sit around talking about their most recent epic adventure.Elfa (the friend). She’s Kofi’s best friend. Unlike him, Elfa handles her game properly and progresses lots. Maybe she’s too proper. She’s not quick to break rules, but will show her impish side if there’s money involved.The guy in red. This mysterious young boy will suddenly appear in the lives of Kofi and his friends searching for a missing bottle. ArtWe’ve attempted to create a unique style of cartoon with Japanese influences. The graphic style is inspired by the concept art of Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. We’ve designed a visual style that seamlessly fits in both the webseries and the video game to create a transmedia experience that’s as coherent as possible. The characters have lots of facial and corporal expressions to create cinematic sequences full of life. Kofi has more than 300 different animations.We want the player to feel like he’s inside an interactive cartoon film, which is why we’re treating those cinematic sequences with infinite care.Music


 
Mariano Ruiz is in charge of Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD’s soundtrack, with occasional collaborations with Javier Ignacio Córdoba and the Spanish punk rock band nO Regrets. Mariano Ruiz has been working with a number of music projects for years, and to get Kofi’s own music identity, he’s based it on soundtracks from sagas like Zelda, Final Fantasy, Skyrim or many other RPG from the 16-bit era, which has resulted in an interesting mix of musical concepts with a retro style that will perfectly accompany the moments of humor and action. 
 WebseriesThe Kofi project was born as an animated Webseries. In the timeline of the Kofi universe, the animated series takes place right before Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD, but both products are scripted so they can also be enjoyed independently. You don’t need to have watched the show to understand the game, nor the other way around! The Webseries can be watched for free on Youtube and Newgrounds and we have new more English episodes incoming.

(First Kofi animations published first time in 2014)
 About Loftur StudioThe studio began thanks to the spread of a parody comic, but mostly thanks to the Spanish manga 5 elementos (5 Elements), a story with 16 published books, over 40,000 sales and several awards over a 9 year period. Having worked on a long project like 5 elementos has been a fundamental exercise to be able to to create a universe so full of moments and characters, which is exactly what the universe of Kofi is.In the past, we also informally worked on the free-to-play fighting video game Mano-chan fighters, a project that gave us the push to take on the webseries Kofi and, later on, the video game Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD.  Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD dev Team

<br/><h3>About me and the toys you've been waiting for since 1989...</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can call me <em>Blackcherry Special</em>, I'm a mysterious french guy creating weird stuff.</p>
<p>When I'm not setting up secret plans to conquer the world, I'm playing Monster High and TMNT with my kids and our 7 years old neighbor. That's right, I've never stopped collecting and playing with toys because the inner 80's kid inside of me never left... and I'm quite happy with that!</p>
<p>My favorite toyline was (and still is) M.A.S.K. by Kenner, and when i take a look at my collection, something seems to be missing: Freshness. This wonderful toyline stopped in 1989 and this let me sad and empty (add violins here). As i get older and older  the idea of creating M.A.S.K. style action figures get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>That led me to start the Laser Punk toyline... and here's the first series: P.U.N.K.S.! A bunch of cool semi-parodic figures, compatible with Kenner's M.A.S.K., part faithful to the classic toyline and part homage to the crazy characters from 80's films like ""Mad Max 2"", ""Class of Nuke'em high"", ""Bronx Warriors"" and ""Escape from New York"".<br/></p>

<p>I need your help to bring Laser Punk to the next level of awesomeness!</p>
<p>Through this campaign, I'm raising funds to produce, promote and expand the Laser Punk toyline by offering the first one (P.U.N.K.S.) in an limited ""first shot"" colorway which will NOT be done ANYMORE!</p>
<p><strike>I don't need much money but i need some: 1000€, this is how i miss to take Laser Punk to the next level!</strike>  <b>DONE!</b><br/></p>
<p>This money will be used for promoting the P.U.N.K.S. series, producing custom blisters and eye-popping art for the packaging of the next Laser Punk series and a Laser Punk website. Trust me, you'll be SHOCKED and AMAZED to see what Laser Punk is coming up with!</p>
<p>Note that Laser Punk toys aren't average industrially mass produced toys, they're made with love in limited runs, <b>handcasted and handpainted</b> the good old way. <b>PRO quality fan made toys!</b><br/></p>

<h3>""What do i get if i make a pledge...?""</h3>
<h3><strike> T-O-Y-S!!</strike></h3>
<p><br/>P.U.N.K.S. means ""Powerful Useful Nasty Kommando Scums"" (what would be a tribute to M.A.S.K. if not named with an acronym?). Like every Laser Punk figures to come, they're 3 inches tall / 1:24 (yep, that's the classic M.A.S.K. scale!) action figures with mask (let's call them ""Power Helmets""), weapon and have 5 points of articulation.</p>
<p>The P.U.N.K.S. action figures are real, they're not abstract concepts or lines on a blueprint: <b>99 P.U.N.K.S. have been already produced and i'm offering them through this campaign as rewards for your help!</b><br/></p>

<br/><p> </p>
<p>So, as I wrote, there's 3 different P.U.N.K.S. characters nicknamed after their haircuts Mohawk, Celtic and London.</p>
<p><strike>So this is what you can get today: articulated action figures from the P.U.N.K.S. series, the very first series in the Laser Punk toyline, hand painted with style in a limited to 99 (that's only 33 of each!) colorway. </strike><br/></p>

IT'S HAPPENING! Website is coming soon and series 2 is on its way. Bookmark laserpunktoys.com and like the facebook page to get updates.





Do you miss the long-defunct M.A.S.K. toyline from the 80's like I do? Well, I've got something for you...

 

 P.U.N.K.S. is a retro M.A.S.K. style series of 3 inches articulated action figures with accessories, the first series in the 1:24 scale Laser Punk toyline!





About me and the toys you've been waiting for since 1989...

You can call me Blackcherry Special, I'm a mysterious french guy creating weird stuff.
When I'm not setting up secret plans to conquer the world, I'm playing Monster High and TMNT with my kids and our 7 years old neighbor. That's right, I've never stopped collecting and playing with toys because the inner 80's kid inside of me never left... and I'm quite happy with that!
My favorite toyline was (and still is) M.A.S.K. by Kenner, and when i take a look at my collection, something seems to be missing: Freshness. This wonderful toyline stopped in 1989 and this let me sad and empty (add violins here). As i get older and older  the idea of creating M.A.S.K. style action figures get bigger and bigger.
That led me to start the Laser Punk toyline... and here's the first series: P.U.N.K.S.! A bunch of cool semi-parodic figures, compatible with Kenner's M.A.S.K., part faithful to the classic toyline and part homage to the crazy characters from 80's films like ""Mad Max 2"", ""Class of Nuke'em high"", ""Bronx Warriors"" and ""Escape from New York"".
 

 


(note that there won't be no ""figure stand"" with the actual action figures you'll get)  
Why this campaign?

I need your help to bring Laser Punk to the next level of awesomeness!
Through this campaign, I'm raising funds to produce, promote and expand the Laser Punk toyline by offering the first one (P.U.N.K.S.) in an limited ""first shot"" colorway which will NOT be done ANYMORE!
I don't need much money but i need some: 1000€, this is how i miss to take Laser Punk to the next level!  DONE!
This money will be used for promoting the P.U.N.K.S. series, producing custom blisters and eye-popping art for the packaging of the next Laser Punk series and a Laser Punk website. Trust me, you'll be SHOCKED and AMAZED to see what Laser Punk is coming up with!
Note that Laser Punk toys aren't average industrially mass produced toys, they're made with love in limited runs, handcasted and handpainted the good old way. PRO quality fan made toys!

 

 
 
""What do i get if i make a pledge...?""
 T-O-Y-S!!
P.U.N.K.S. means ""Powerful Useful Nasty Kommando Scums"" (what would be a tribute to M.A.S.K. if not named with an acronym?). Like every Laser Punk figures to come, they're 3 inches tall / 1:24 (yep, that's the classic M.A.S.K. scale!) action figures with mask (let's call them ""Power Helmets""), weapon and have 5 points of articulation.
The P.U.N.K.S. action figures are real, they're not abstract concepts or lines on a blueprint: 99 P.U.N.K.S. have been already produced and i'm offering them through this campaign as rewards for your help!


 
So, as I wrote, there's 3 different P.U.N.K.S. characters nicknamed after their haircuts Mohawk, Celtic and London.
So this is what you can get today: articulated action figures from the P.U.N.K.S. series, the very first series in the Laser Punk toyline, hand painted with style in a limited to 99 (that's only 33 of each!) colorway. 
 

   
But wait, there's more...

   Comics!
 
Toys are way more interesting when they have a backstory, don't you think? Well, I don't have the power to bring you a saturday morning cartoon but i could do you a comic. Actually... I'm doing it right now. As you read this text, I'm finishing and lettering a 12 pages comic that will tell you both the origins and the future of the P.U.N.K.S. characters! This comic is going to be put online during the campaign so you can read it for free (more details coming soon).
 
 

 

 
 SPREAD THE WORD!!!
 
Throw a message on your Facebook, talk about it on forums, tell a friend, tell a foe, just talk about it and give links to this page that will help A LOT! I'll be a happy man if you just post this link http://laserpunktoys.com
I really need to reach as many people as possible to continue and bring more figures!

<p>One Of the
main objectives of this Crowdfunding campaign is inviting our community to make
something very special happen, taking part as beta testers of the videogame and
this wonderfull cubic experience. We want to share it in a organsied , taking
<b>timing as a serious part of the crowdfunding process </b>.</p>
<p>We have
alredy developed a 40 % of the game –including gamedesign, art developing,
animations, 10 platform game design and mechanics  and more than 10 touch games plus creating a team.</p>
<p>The Aim is
to work in a production package that we will split into 5 different
apps, all coherently divide into different cubes and activities. We are
inviting to the crowdfunders through perks to take part on the early product
feedback .</p>
<p>The
production planning is divided into 3 main stages : until june, the aim is to
focus into the art and game design, for ending the current process and starting
with programming idle and general development issues . There are two main
production packages –from May to August 2015- and from September to middle
December 2015 – for both art and programming. The aim is to divide the work
into 1, 2 and 2 cubes work.</p>
<p>The
official launch is programmed for February after 2 months work for fixing ,
server uploading and programming.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Funds</h3>

<p>We need the
money for music design, programming and English version adaptation of the
game.  The Crowdfunding USD$ Goal is  35000 dollars.</p>
<p>The art development
includes both ending art and gamedesign, focusing on improving the developments that have been carried out. The programming is based on a 3-4 people
team – interships, junior programmer and 1 supervisor- that works  together with the art team. </p>
<p>The taxes part is divided
into two different categories : the tax for the product has 21 % retention but
other rewards can be set as donations and have a 13,68 % retention fees. If we
add expenses of personel , it is a 25 % approximated
of the current budget.</p>

TimeLine



One Of the
main objectives of this Crowdfunding campaign is inviting our community to make
something very special happen, taking part as beta testers of the videogame and
this wonderfull cubic experience. We want to share it in a organsied , taking
timing as a serious part of the crowdfunding process .
We have
alredy developed a 40 % of the game –including gamedesign, art developing,
animations, 10 platform game design and mechanics  and more than 10 touch games plus creating a team.
The Aim is
to work in a production package that we will split into 5 different
apps, all coherently divide into different cubes and activities. We are
inviting to the crowdfunders through perks to take part on the early product
feedback .
The
production planning is divided into 3 main stages : until june, the aim is to
focus into the art and game design, for ending the current process and starting
with programming idle and general development issues . There are two main
production packages –from May to August 2015- and from September to middle
December 2015 – for both art and programming. The aim is to divide the work
into 1, 2 and 2 cubes work.
The
official launch is programmed for February after 2 months work for fixing ,
server uploading and programming.   Funds







We need the
money for music design, programming and English version adaptation of the
game.  The Crowdfunding USD$ Goal is  35000 dollars.
The art development
includes both ending art and gamedesign, focusing on improving the developments that have been carried out. The programming is based on a 3-4 people
team – interships, junior programmer and 1 supervisor- that works  together with the art team. 
The taxes part is divided
into two different categories : the tax for the product has 21 % retention but
other rewards can be set as donations and have a 13,68 % retention fees. If we
add expenses of personel , it is a 25 % approximated
of the current budget.
    Rewards

NOUS SOMMES ATTAQUÉS
 
Nous faisons face à de violentes attaques d’une force inconnue et actuellement presque toutes nos communications ont été coupées, mais nous avons une certitude : nous sommes en guerre !
Toutes les forces militaires sont mobilisées pour protéger les populations civiles et stopper cette invasion. Nous ne disposons pour le moment d’aucune information qui pourrait justifier ces terribles attaques ni déterminer qui sont ces ennemies, ce qu’ils nous veulent et d’où peuvent ils venir.
Le temps est venu d’une contre attaque regroupant toutes les forces militaires de tous les pays afin de faire face à cet ennemi commun. C’est pourquoi la PiewFighter AirForce est placée immédiatement sous le commandement opérationnel de l’Agence International de la Coalition.
Pour des raisons de sécurité, l’identité et la localisation du quartier général ainsi que des membres de la coalition doivent rester secrètes et ne seront communiquées qu’ultérieurement au personnel accrédité.
Les premiers éléments ennemis récupérés sur le terrain sont en cours d’analyse mais nous savons de sources sûres que l’ennemie est lourdement armé, qu’il possède une intelligence vive et une soif de destruction terrifiante.
Nous vous transmettrons régulièrement des éléments classés secret défense pour que vous puissiez vous préparer à votre future mission.
Rester à l’affut et soyez prêt à vous battre !
 
                                                       Nous avons besoin de vous.

<p></p></div>","Hi everyone. We’re Laia and Ian, founders of Sukubus Studio. We’re delighted to show you the first miniatures range we’ve developed on 3D for our studio. Thanks to this platform we are glad to show you our creations and would like to know your thoughts on them. We hope you like them as much as we’ve enjoyed developing them.The idea came to us when deciding what would be the first miniature we’d create. We thought it nice to start with our logo’s mascot. We made a few sketches looking for inspiration, until Laia modeled Sukubus Fighter #2, to give it as prize in Fantasy Football competitions or other promotional events.  When we received the master model, we liked it so much that it led us to develop a whole team. We wanted to give to each miniature its own flair and personality, making them easy to recognize, playable and a delight to paint.Sukubus Team is made up by a group of succubae arisen from the worst nightmares of mortals. In it there are diverse kinds of succubae that represent the diverse roles in a Fantasy Football match. We’ve prepared several stretch goals that will add to the team as the campaign develops.Production will be made in high quality resin on a 28mm scale. We’re certain of the finishing of each miniature, as they will be made by our friends at RN Estudio, great professionals that have a lot of experience in this kind of campaigns.This is the first master model that RN Estudio did for us before the campaign. This isn´t the final model, but it served to check the correct anatomical proportions and small details like spikes, horns or tails for the next models.An example of a painted miniature by RN Estudio.Mystical World has made these awesome Dark Stone Heads bases to complete the Sukubus Team. These magnificent art works fit perfectly with your miniatures.We want to offer the best quality for our backers. That's why we have managed to make the production of Sukubus Dices with Chessex. A great customized dices company that get the best results. Sukubus Star Shadow is a veteran Sukubus Dancer that improved her technique with infamous secret weapons. This miniature will be free for all those who have requested a Sukubus Team and will be a new reward for the rest of the backers.Impaler demon is the ripper of your hidden senses. This miniature will be free for 
all those who have requested a Sukubus Team and will be a new reward for
 the rest of the backers.Sukubus Spawn is an unpredictable twisted demon that changes her mood suddenly. This miniature will be free for 
all those who have requested a Sukubus Team and will be a new reward for
 the rest of the backers.The last Stretch Goal is here. Fanatics is composed by the team mascot and a girl that wants to be the official team cheerleader. Do you think that she will get it?. This miniature will be free for 
all those who have requested a Sukubus Team and will be a new reward for
 the rest of the backers.Thanks to your support we’ll be able to carry out production and all costs that it implies:1- Master models creation.2- Serial manufacturing of your miniatures.3- Packing, shipping and taxes costs.Thank you beforehand for your support. We’d like to thank particularly to all campaign collaborators and all those who have shared our links or send us funny comments.RN Estudio: Crowdfunding manager, 3D print, cast and professional painting.Mystical World: Customized bases.Chessex: Customized dices.Darkstone: Consulting; promotion, raffles.Forja y Desván: Consulting; promotion.Álvaro Pantoja García: Professional painting.Patrick Davenne: Translation.We expect to be able to deliver the product by January

Sing that Theme Tune! Reenact this Scene! (Did you just read that as a cheesy Game Show Host? Good.)Viewing Parties for live events like eSports tournaments or exclusive 360° trailers and movies.Workshops with eSports coaches, comic book writers/artists, cosplayers, VR vloggers or even virtual sculptors so you can learn how to create your own avatar upgrades, that you could then make and sell.We envision businesses opening virtual shops in Geekzonia, where the staff working in VR, will be able to communicate face to face with worldwide customers like never before!These events are only the beginning of our journey through time and space, as Geekzonia will always be working to bring you bigger and better adventures.

All donors will gain early access, be invited to exclusive virtual tours & automatically entered into our competition to WIN an Oculus Rift!Other perks include VIP access to exclusive events, permanent fixtures in your honour and even a VR Wedding!Once Geekzonia is ready you’ll be able to download & install Geekzonia from one of the VR app stores, like Oculus or Steam.

Web-Nomad's love of adventure, their ability to solve problems and
get around obstacles, their amount of movement, etc. The entire web
community before the voting day can discuss in the forums and chat
with other users and with the Web-Nomads to share their opinions and
solidify how they are going to vote. The users can create an online
campaign for their Web-Nomads via a separate forum or chat space to
support their favorite Web-Nomad,</p>

(described before)</b></p>
<p>At
random times the web community can propose challenges for the
Web-Nomad to complete. The amount of points awarded for each
challenge is based upon the difficulty of the challenge.</p>

example of a challenge:<i> Cross a boarder before the end of the week,
sleep in different places four consecutive nights, earn 150 euros in

The Web-Nomads who are selected
are expected to use common sense at all times and respect the spirit
of the game. They are expected to follow the game's rules and to try
their best to win.</p>
<p><b>The
most important factor for the Web-Nomads to realize is that winning
isn't simply about getting to the finish line first, but that they
maintain a high approval rating with the web community and the judges
and the points earned through the challenges.</b></p>
<p>However
there are controls set in place, so that if in the case a Web-Nomad
does attempt to break the rules or sabotage the game and it is
proven<b>,
the Web-Nomad will be immediately removed from the game and must find
their own way back home with no assistance from the organization.</b></p>
<p>
Through the dedicated app, the
web community and the judges will be able to follow the movement of
the Web-Nomads and in the case where abnormal movement is noted, that
does not correspond with the Web-Nomad's community interactions, the
Web-Nomad will be put on trial and adjudicated and sentenced by the
web community and judges. The end result of a trial could be loss of
points, complete a challenge or exclusion from the game.</p>
<p>
The users can place a Web-Nomad
on trial when something seems abnormal with the Web-Nomad by creating
a case by him or herself and/or with friends, parents that are near
to the Web-Nomad.</p>
<p>
There are also official
controllers (who are hired by the organization) that can investigate
and pursue a Web-Nomad to intervene if something is not right. The
Web-Nomad does not know the identity of the official controllers.
Above all, the most important clarification, is that the users
themselves are the ultimate controllers of the game.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642335/files/20140611133336-coppa.jpg?1402518816"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>-The
first and second place winners will receive awards (first
place will receive 50,000 euros and second place will receive 20,000

<p>All
the text, video and photos of the Web-Nomads will be summarized at
the end of the game for the creation of 12 e-books. The proceeds from
sales of these e-books will be given to the Web-Nomads. The first

</p><p>Our initial goal is to raise
50,000 euros, that will fund the start up of the project, including
the website, the dedicated app and all other costs, prior to the
commencement of the actual game itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of this 50,000 euros, 25,000
euros will used towards the technical side of the project, including
the development of the website and dedicated app and the other 25,000
euros will be used for promotion and ad campaigns. If we raise funds
above our original goal of 50,000 euros, this money will be used, so
that less users will have to pay for the fully function app and to be
a part of the selection process. If we raise more than 400,000 euros,
the app and the selection process will be start before next spring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We believe if we this
project is fully realized, it will revolutionize the idea of games
and social networks, because the users are able to participate in
real time with both. We believe it will also revolutionize reality
television, because the viewers, will not just be viewers, they will
be participants who will have constant control of the characters they
are watching and will have many different options to become fully
immersed in the experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case the the first
edition is a success, there will be the possibility of continuing
with new and alternative editions of the game, for example: a local
edition for each country, a couples or singles only edition, a family
edition, a extreme adventure edition and many more. This is just the
tip of the iceberg, that can evolve and change depending on the
organization as well as suggestions from the players and users. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During a period where there
is no game going on, the website and dedicate app will still be
active and function as a forum for travel knowledge, where users can
share their travels stories, long journeys or simply weekend
getaways, as well as share travel advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any contribution for the
start up of this project, will also be a contribution to a new way of
communicating, a new way of playing a game and a new way of travel.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/704666/files/20140709043627-ultimo_INDIEGOGO.jpg?1404905787"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b><b><br/></b></b></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b><b>WHO WE ARE</b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Just watch us:<br/></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FBnTN4dtbQgw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBnTN4dtbQgw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FBnTN4dtbQgw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>

No
money world tour
is the first web based global reality game which puts you right in
the thick of the experience, gives you the desire to pack up your
bags and rush out that door, to meet new people, see new places, to
get into sticky situations and just as quickly, get out of them, to
compete, to adapt to each unique environment, to face insurmountable
problems, obstacles around every corner, and above all, the desire to
be boundless, free!
No
money world tour is
a game where
the protagonists (Web-Nomads)
are real people and the players are users who can interact and engage
with them and each other through a web based platform and/or a
dedicated app, making it their duty to keep each protagonists' story
alive, literally.
It's
the real version of The
Hunger Games,
where the users through the interactive network are completely
immersed and are able to control and effect the adventure of the
Web-Nomads with just a click of the mouse!

Everyone has one life to live, a destination to get to, we are all in this game together!!Adventures,
explorers, solo travellers, dreamers, or simply wishers and watchers
who have no time to really travel. For all of you (and those who are
curious), I introduce you to the No Money World Tour: The world as
you've never seen it. But soon enough, you will see just that, the
world as you've never seen it, with your own eyes, from home or in
person.                              

All
the video content of the game is shot by the Web-Nomads and supported
by you, the users, a big web community ready to help the Web-Nomads,
to comment on them, vote for them, observe their every action and
communicate with them.The
game is like Second
Life,
but rather than graphics and sounds, the Avatars
are real people. 


EVERYONE
on this green and blue earth, from all walks of life, all shapes,
sizes and ages, deep down inside, yearns to be a nomad. 


The daily grind, the 9 to 5, endless patterns, eat, work,
sleep, repeat, we are bound to drive on these highways of so called
living forever, but we are always looking for that turn off, towards
freedom, away from the fast paced, the road rage and the all too
familiar.

EVERYONE
wants that lone chance to be strong, face your own inner fears,
EVERYONE wants that singular opportunity to go back to their
ancestral roots, alone, the unrelenting sun beating down, the chill
of cold ice rattling through every inch of your body, with only your
bare hands and your mind as survival tools, but in this game, also
having the knowledge that there is someone out there, a friend that
you do not know yet, who will help you in your most desperate hour. 
                    If
we think man is just a rational being, than we fail to consider all
of life's variables and possibilities.
If
true happiness is only authentic when it is shared with others, then
I will share my adventures, every intimate detail with you, my ups
and downs, facing myself in the mirror, the real one and the societal
one. I will share with you, as I overcome the depths of the seven
seas, climb the highest peaks, share with you my authentic happiness,
my authentic freedom. 


This
is the story of six people and six couples, that you chose to partake
in the no
money world tour.
70,000
euros are up for grabs and much, much more!                                                                 The Web-Nomads will be the 18 participants of the game (six single people and six couples), that will be selected by the users to partake in this first person adventure and will also be the Avatars of the web based community.                                                                        After the selection, the Web-Nomads will be ready to participate in the greatest adventure of their entire lives.There are some set rules to follow, but the most important component will be their ability to adapt and take part in a world tour with very little money.              

The
online community are the central players for the progression of this
reality game.
Everything
can be controlled through the website and the dedicated app via a
tablet or smartphone.
the
members of the community can:

-Vote

-Give
suggestions to the Web-Nomads around the world

-Organize
meetings between themselves

functions. Users

buying individual components.The website for No Money World Tour will also act as a social network to share your own personal travel stories and information. The purpose for users to suggest travel itineraries and ideas, is so that other users on the site may find new friends and travel companions and may benefit from others' travel knowledge and possibly partake on an adventure of their own. Whether it be a long journey across several countries or continents, a weekend getaway or simply a work trip, users will be able to easily share their experiences with the ability to post photos, video, advice, suggestions and stories on the network through the website and/or the dedicated app, allowing the community to get to know each user a little better. Allowing other users to get to know you better through your posted experiences and constantly updated travels may give you as the user an advantage if you decide to be part of the Web Nomad selection process. Everyone is able to download the app and join the website for free to be part of the community, as well as have a chance to partake in the actual game itself. 
The
judges of the reality game will be ten experienced travelers,
including people who have travelled the world with little to no money
or people who travel adventurously.
Each
judge will have a personal icon displayed on the website as well as
an in depth personal description about them.
Each
judge will post daily comments about the game and give suggestions to
the users.
The
users can post questions to the judges, who will answer through an
FAQ or directly to them, depending on the question. All the questions
will pertain to the Web-Nomads, general curiosities and comments on
the game. All other questions can be sent to game's administration,
the webmaster and/or the press.
The
winner of the game, if he/she/they want, can become a judge/judges
for the next game.A
constantly updated life bar
of the Web-Nomads allows users to see all the information required
for them to have constant control over the progress of all the
Web-Nomads;
The
life bar highlights the following information of the Web-Nomads:

Web-Nomad out. In this case, every user is allowed to make a single
donation of 50 euro cents, with the total amount for the entire
community being 300 euros. This function can be accessed a maximum of
three times per Web-Nomad, but every donation equals a loss of 1,000
points                                  
Phase
1  Subscribtions
The
first phase is for the user to subscribe to the website for the
selection process of the Web-Nomads to take part in the reality game.To
subscribe to be a candidate in the selection process to be a
Web-Nomad, would-be candidates must pay 7 euros for the single
Web-Nomads category and 12 euro for the couples Web-Nomads category.                                                                                                        There
will be a counter on every page of the website that will start at
100,000 and for every new user who subscribes, the number will decrease by one, (two for the couples selection subscribers). The
first 5,000 subscribers can participate in the selectionprocess free
of charge. The second group of 5,000 subscribers can participate for
half price.
When
the counter reaches zero, the game will commence. In one week's time
from the final subscription,voting starts for the selection of the
Web-Nomads.                                           The
12 votes can be cast anytime during theone month voting period. Subscribers
do not have to be Web-Nomad candidates to take part in web month voting period.
In
this phase, all members of the web community can create blogs and
forums to decide who to vote for, from what location in the world the
game should start from, the best route for the future Web-Nomads to
follow, the possible travel and situational scenarios for the future
Web-Nomads, discuss past travel experiences, post suggestions and
many other things.  

The
results of the vote will be announced the day after voting closes, so
everyone is unaware of who the Web-Nomads are until the very last
moment.
Rules
of the selection process
Anyone
around the world, above the age of 18 years old, with a valid
passport can partake in the selection process for
the great adventure that is the “No Money World Tour”.                                                                                                 To

-Music,
Movies, Books




-Types
of People I enjoy

father daughter/father son couple, the child must be at least 14
years old.Phase
2 The Selection
From
the selection process, 100 candidates will be chosen (50 couples and
50 single candidates). If several candidates have equal numbers of
votes, the three judges of the game will decide which candidates are
to be chosen. The 100 chosen candidates must release a second video.
This video must be shot in a public space (5 minutes max), simulating
a typical journey they may participate in within the game and an
additional self interview (3 minutes max).                                                                                                       
                               Phase 3 For
the Web-Nomads to learn during orientationOnly
three weeks prior to the start of the game the 18 Web-Nomads (six
couples and six singles) will be informed that they will participate
in the game. In the case that some of them refuse to participate, the
next in line will become the selected Web-Nomad.

A
date and location will be chosen anywhere in the world where the
Web-Nomads must be all together to start the game.

All
the travel expenses to the game's start location from the Web-Nomads
current location will be covered by the organization.
                                               
Game
Commencement
During
these three days of orientation all the Web-Nomads will receive the
No Money World Tour starter kit, which includes:

600
euros in cash – 1000 euros in cash for couples

One empty backpack – two empty backpacks for the couples

One small tent and one or two small sleeping bags

One tablet

One small portable computer, including all the software required

One smartphone with an international sim card

One dedicated app on the tablet, computer and smartphone to track
their location

Each Web-Nomad will have a separate bank account with no money
inside, opened by the the game's administration. Each Web-Nomad is
also given a credit card (due to the fact that traveling requires
that some transactions can only be done with a credit card), but the
Web-Nomads must find some means to put the money in this bank
account. The organization has access to all of these bank accounts,
including access codes and can control and view the transactions made
with each bank account. The users may also view the bank accounts and
transactions of the Web-Nomads.

                    
All
the Web-Nomads are allowed to be bring their own personal effects
with them. They are not allowed to bring with them additional cash
(besides the cash given to them in their No Money World Tour starter
kits), credit cards and/or bank cardsTRAVEL RULES

-There
will be constant updated rankings of the Web-Nomads through their   life bars

-
The Web-Nomads can choose to travel from west to east or vice versa

-
There are no limitations placed on the Web-Nomads to travel from
north to south and vice versa

-The
Web-Nomads are forbidden to use additional funds besides the money
they are give in the No Money World Tour starter kits or money they

-Everyday
the Web-Nomads must post on the website at least 10 minutes of video,
where the web community can see what they are doing. The Web-Nomads
may also live stream (with the on-air function) for ten minutes.


In
case it is impossible for the Web-Nomad to post or live stream video
due to something beyond their control (ie they are in a location with
no electricity), they must make a video summary of the blackout days
and post everything at a later date. In this case, the Web-Nomad must
post the video summary within a week's time. In the case of no
internet connection, the Web-Nomad must record everything and post
the video at a later date.

-Everyday
the Web-Nomads have to post a video journal (1.5 minutes minimum),
where they describe the current day or their upcoming day ahead.


In
case it is impossible for the Web-Nomad to post or live stream video
due to something beyond their control (ie they are in a location with
no electricity), they must make a video summary of the blackout days
and post everything at a later date. In this case, the Web-Nomad must
post the video summary within a week's time. In the case of no
internet connection, the Web-Nomad must record everything and post
the video at a later date.

-Everyday
the Web-Nomads must post at least 20 lines of text where they
describe their current day or their upcoming day.


In
case of no internet connection, they still must write this
description, and must post it within a week's time.

-The
Web-Nomads must maintain a constant connection with the web community

-
The Web-Nomads cannot spend more than 300 euros on the airplane
tickets – 600 euros for the couples

-The
Web-Nomads cannot accept monetary presents during their travels, all
the money spent, must be money they earn

-The
travel time for the world tour must be between 80 and 120 days

-Sometimes
a challenge will be chosen by the web community for the Web-Nomad to
participate in. The Web-Nomad can decide whether or not he/she/they
will do it. If they complete the challenge, they will earn points
and/or money, but if they do not wish to partake in the challenge
they will receive nothing.

-In
case a Web-Nomads looses or has his/hers/their tablet, smartphone,
portable computer and/or credit card stolen , the organization will
try to assist them as soon as possible. Prior to assistance, the
Web-Nomad must make an effort to find a solution (ie an internet
cafe, asking their host for assistance, etc)
                        -Each
Web-Nomad starts the game with 0 points. The winner of the game is
the Web-Nomad with the most points (with the possibility of some
Web-Nomads having minus points).
The
Web-Nomads can acquire points in the follow ways:
Every
ten days a vote will take place involving the entire web community.
The
vote will open and close on a single day. The web community is asked
to vote for their favorite Web-Nomad (one vote per user). The votes
will be tallied up and points will be given to each Web-Nomad based
on their overall ranking during the vote.
The
users vote for their favorite Web-Nomad based on sympathy, the
Web-Nomad's love of adventure, their ability to solve problems and
get around obstacles, their amount of movement, etc. The entire web
community before the voting day can discuss in the forums and chat
with other users and with the Web-Nomads to share their opinions and
solidify how they are going to vote. The users can create an online
campaign for their Web-Nomads via a separate forum or chat space to
support their favorite Web-Nomad,
-Challenges
(described before)
At
random times the web community can propose challenges for the
Web-Nomad to complete. The amount of points awarded for each
challenge is based upon the difficulty of the challenge.
An
example of a challenge: Cross a boarder before the end of the week,
sleep in different places four consecutive nights, earn 150 euros in
four days, etc.
-Judges
Votes
Like
the users, each judge has the ability to vote every ten days. The
judges must vote for their favorite Web-Nomad, but they must explain
to the community why they voted in such a way. The
votes will be tallied up and points will be given to each Web-Nomad
based on their overall ranking during the vote.-Time
to complete the entire world tour
In
the order that the Web-Nomads arrive back to the exact starting point
of the game, they will be awarded the follow points:-Country awarded pointsAt the start of the game, a specific country (chosen at random) will be presented to the Web-Nomads to travel to. If the Web-Nomad gets to this country, they will be awarded 8000 points.-Countries travelled toEvery country travelled to (including small countries) by the Web-Nomads, they will be awarded 800 points.                                    
A
Web-Nomad may receive a penalty in the case where a rule infraction
has been made.Some challenges and decisions may also result in a
penalty (ex. asking for user donations).
  -Breaking
specific rules may result in a Web-Nomad being ousted from the game.
The community may decide the gravity of the punishment.     
										       

-The
Web-Nomad may also decide to leave the game at his/hers/their
digression at any moment. In the case that one member of a Web-Nomad
couple decides to leave, the other person may continue the game solo,
but will receive a penalty of 3000 points. 

The Web-Nomads who are selected
are expected to use common sense at all times and respect the spirit
of the game. They are expected to follow the game's rules and to try
their best to win.
The
most important factor for the Web-Nomads to realize is that winning
isn't simply about getting to the finish line first, but that they
maintain a high approval rating with the web community and the judges
and the points earned through the challenges.
However
there are controls set in place, so that if in the case a Web-Nomad
does attempt to break the rules or sabotage the game and it is
proven,
the Web-Nomad will be immediately removed from the game and must find
their own way back home with no assistance from the organization.

Through the dedicated app, the
web community and the judges will be able to follow the movement of
the Web-Nomads and in the case where abnormal movement is noted, that
does not correspond with the Web-Nomad's community interactions, the
Web-Nomad will be put on trial and adjudicated and sentenced by the
web community and judges. The end result of a trial could be loss of
points, complete a challenge or exclusion from the game.

The users can place a Web-Nomad
on trial when something seems abnormal with the Web-Nomad by creating
a case by him or herself and/or with friends, parents that are near
to the Web-Nomad.

There are also official
controllers (who are hired by the organization) that can investigate
and pursue a Web-Nomad to intervene if something is not right. The
Web-Nomad does not know the identity of the official controllers.
Above all, the most important clarification, is that the users
themselves are the ultimate controllers of the game.
-The
first and second place winners will receive awards (first
place will receive 50,000 euros and second place will receive 20,000
euros).
All
the text, video and photos of the Web-Nomads will be summarized at
the end of the game for the creation of 12 e-books. The proceeds from
sales of these e-books will be given to the Web-Nomads. The first
place winner will have a real book published about their adventures.
The
winners can be couple or single Web-Nomads, but couples must share
their winnings.                                         
As
perks we offer a number of advantages for the supervision of the
game. Those who will sponsor the project through crowdfunding will
benefit of our extra perks. For funds of 25 euros up we will offer
limited edition gadgets. Thirty days before the end of the campaign
we will be sending the gadgets only to those who support us. The
tablets will also be shipped within 30 days along with the limited
edition cover. We will send the entire creation of the App as soon as
it is completed, before the launch of the game which is scheduled and
due in April 2015.Following is a summary of all the perks:         
The cost of the first
edition of No Money World Tour is quoted at 400,000 euros, without
the use of sponsors or other financial contributors.                                                   

Our initial goal is to raise
50,000 euros, that will fund the start up of the project, including
the website, the dedicated app and all other costs, prior to the
commencement of the actual game itself.

Of this 50,000 euros, 25,000
euros will used towards the technical side of the project, including
the development of the website and dedicated app and the other 25,000
euros will be used for promotion and ad campaigns. If we raise funds
above our original goal of 50,000 euros, this money will be used, so
that less users will have to pay for the fully function app and to be
a part of the selection process. If we raise more than 400,000 euros,
the app and the selection process will be start before next spring.

We believe if we this
project is fully realized, it will revolutionize the idea of games
and social networks, because the users are able to participate in
real time with both. We believe it will also revolutionize reality
television, because the viewers, will not just be viewers, they will
be participants who will have constant control of the characters they
are watching and will have many different options to become fully
immersed in the experience.

In the case the the first
edition is a success, there will be the possibility of continuing
with new and alternative editions of the game, for example: a local
edition for each country, a couples or singles only edition, a family
edition, a extreme adventure edition and many more. This is just the
tip of the iceberg, that can evolve and change depending on the
organization as well as suggestions from the players and users. 


During a period where there
is no game going on, the website and dedicate app will still be
active and function as a forum for travel knowledge, where users can
share their travels stories, long journeys or simply weekend
getaways, as well as share travel advice.

Any contribution for the
start up of this project, will also be a contribution to a new way of
communicating, a new way of playing a game and a new way of travel.WHO WE AREJust watch us:",83.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h3>BOTTLES NIGHT OUT - Drinking Game</h3>
<p><strong>I love drinking games</strong>. Sitting around with a group of friends with some beers and a deck of cards is how I've spent many weekend nights. But so many times my friends and I were out and about and didn't have a deck of cards to play a drinking game. So I decided to make a fun &amp; hilarious drinking game video game for your phone or tablet so you can take it with you wherever you go. Plus this game is way funnier than a deck of cards :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bottles Night Out</strong> is a drinking game you play with up to 6 people. It can be played on your ipad or android tablet, or if you're out at the bar played on your cell phone.</p>
<p><img alt=""Drinking game title screen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bottlesnightout.com/title.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" title=""Bottles Night Out- title screen""/></p>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY </strong>:</p>
<p>The game play is simple and fun. It is filled with hundreds of crazy animations with your characters getting into all sorts of adventures.</p>
<p><img alt=""Drinking game characters"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bottlesnightout.com/choose.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bottles Night Out - characters ""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Players take turns tapping drink icons. Each drink will take your character on a random wild animated adventure.</p>
<p><img alt=""drinking game icons"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bottlesnightout.com/drinks1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bottles Night Out - drinks""/></p>
<p>There are thousands of drink and animated adventure combinations so no 2 games will ever be the same.</p>
<h3>Here are some screen shots from the game:</h3>

<h3>If it's a good adventure you get to give out drinks, but if its a bad adventure you have to take drinks. Our ""<em>Project Video</em>"" is filled with actual animations from the game.</h3>
<p>There are also tons of your favorite aspects of regular drinking games such as crazy rules, truth or dare and even spin the bottle.</p>
<p><img alt=""Drinking game - truth or dare"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bottlesnightout.com/dares.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bottles Night Out - dares""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has always been my dream to make video games. I created, wrote and designed every aspect of the game. It has been a full time job for me for the past year.</p>
<p>This is my 1st video game and so far has been funded completely by me. I am hoping to raise funds to finish paying for the programming of this game and for marketing costs. With your help, we can make this funny game become a success and make sure it's a must have for anybody that is drinking with some friends :) </p>
Because of the large scale of this game (8400 drink and adventure combos) I am about $4000 over budget on the programming of this large game. Hopefully thats where you awesome supporters come in.</div>
<div>I also have some fun and unique ideas for marketing. Such as hiring alchahol promo girls to promote the game in bar districts of big cities and college towns all across the country. Most apps dont really have a ground campaign that includes attractive girls and guys promoting their apps in and outside of bars. So I think this will be a 1st. If I can raise enough support I can make this idea a reality. Which I think will help this game become a huge success.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you so much for even considering to support the game.</div>
<div>Have fun &amp; Happy drinking :P</div></span></div>","BOTTLES NIGHT OUT - Drinking Game

Players take turns tapping drink icons. Each drink will take your character on a random wild animated adventure.

There are thousands of drink and animated adventure combinations so no 2 games will ever be the same.
Here are some screen shots from the game:



If it's a good adventure you get to give out drinks, but if its a bad adventure you have to take drinks. Our ""Project Video"" is filled with actual animations from the game.
There are also tons of your favorite aspects of regular drinking games such as crazy rules, truth or dare and even spin the bottle.

 
It has always been my dream to make video games. I created, wrote and designed every aspect of the game. It has been a full time job for me for the past year.
This is my 1st video game and so far has been funded completely by me. I am hoping to raise funds to finish paying for the programming of this game and for marketing costs. With your help, we can make this funny game become a success and make sure it's a must have for anybody that is drinking with some friends :) 
Because of the large scale of this game (8400 drink and adventure combos) I am about $4000 over budget on the programming of this large game. Hopefully thats where you awesome supporters come in.
I also have some fun and unique ideas for marketing. Such as hiring alchahol promo girls to promote the game in bar districts of big cities and college towns all across the country. Most apps dont really have a ground campaign that includes attractive girls and guys promoting their apps in and outside of bars. So I think this will be a 1st. If I can raise enough support I can make this idea a reality. Which I think will help this game become a huge success.
 
Thank you so much for even considering to support the game.
Have fun & Happy drinking :P",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>         <strong>  Why does MacXTag work?</strong>
</h1>
<p>While teaching his own popular TaeRobics class one afternoon, former international karate champion Ian McCranor had a realization.  His classes were packed with women – most with no martial arts background – who loved the punching and kicking AND executed both with surprisingly good technique.  Yet, whenever Ian tried to incorporate a focus on self-defense into one of his classes, these same women were simply not interested.  Punching and kicking in an energized room pulsing with upbeat music and the whooping and hollering of their friends produced endorphins.  Punching and kicking as a defense against an attack – even a simulated one – produced adrenaline.  In short, his clients ran toward the pleasure and excitement (endorphins), and ran from the fear (adrenaline). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This revelation got Ian thinking.  For kids, exercise for the sake of exercise is hard work and drudgery and most parents have a fight on their hands getting their kids to participate.  If Ian could figure out a way to introduce exercise to kids disguised in a fun, endorphin-producing package, he would be a hero to all parents concerned with the health and happiness of their children.  Within days of this light bulb moment MacXTag was born!</p>
<h1><strong> </strong></h1>
<h1>
<strong>Extensive R&amp;D on MacXTag </strong><strong>has taken place</strong>
</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The first prototype for MacXTag had its issues, but we knew we were onto a winner. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""That's right, Ben, even Edison started somewhere!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/164/036/3e5493aabe944d75e1ba1d4371b69541_large.jpg?1347896366"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<h3 class=""template asset""><em><strong>That's right, Ben, even Edison started somewhere</strong></em></h3>
<p>We immediately set about patenting our concept and gear, and trademarking the MacXTag name. Research and development continued, resulting at times in gear that was – shall we say – <em>interesting</em>.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Hey, Rachel, Rocky the Squirrel has been looking for that hat!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/163/995/5dc3cdc61004d59254fc397bc2838338_large.jpg?1347894525"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p>Hook and loop was a major ingredient in the design of the MacXTag gear.  We experimented with different thicknesses and strengths, and spent hours in MacXTag classes with kids, testing and retesting the equipment.</p>

As gym owners, we spend all our time keeping fit and helping others achieve fitness. It’s always been our dream to make a powerful difference in the fight against childhood obesity – a dream we’ve talked about for YEARS with a mixture of frustration and helplessness. That is until now…

              With MacXTag and your help,
               we CAN make a difference!
MacXTag combines the discipline of regular exercise with the carefree fun of tag in a game that encourages physical activity in kids by rewarding them with collectible TAGs featuring their favorite stars, teams and sport heroes. In short, it blends the benefits of exercise with the thrill of a modern day video game. MacXTag will improve the health, self-esteem and social skills of children in the same way that exercise does, without the fight to get them participating! For organized MacXTag leagues and classes, instructors can also utilize our upcoming unique social media platform that offers a system of points kids can redeem for prizes, reinforcing their continued regular involvement.
MacXTag offers something for kids, for parents and for business owners who share our passion!  
Kids love the pure fun of MacXTag!

But, wait, there's more....!
 
Kids love the collectibles!  Whether its their favorite team, the completer piece in a MacXTag puzzle, or a rare collectible they’ve been lucky enough to win, the fun of finding that special TAG never gets old. 

 

But, wait…there’s more! 
 
Parents appreciate the many skills acquired and lessons learned as their children play MacXTag games. 

 
But, wait…there’s more!
 
Available only thru businesses offering organized MacXTag classes, the coded collectible TAGs can be redeemed for points that kids accumulate for prizes. 
 

 
But, wait…there’s more!
 
As kids scan their coded TAGs, their online community of friends is notified, keeping MacXTag and their MacXTag club top of mind!

 
But, wait...there's more!
 
Exclusive club rewards, challenges, discount notifications and unique offerings.  For more information go to www.macxtag.com.
…Kids have fun without even realizing they are exercising.
…Parents encourage healthy habits and social skills for their children in an educational environment.
…Business owners see their business grow through classes, the purchase of collectible TAGs and the redemption of TAG points.
 …And most importantly…
 
We ALL do our part to fight childhood obesity!
                
           Why does MacXTag work?

While teaching his own popular TaeRobics class one afternoon, former international karate champion Ian McCranor had a realization.  His classes were packed with women – most with no martial arts background – who loved the punching and kicking AND executed both with surprisingly good technique.  Yet, whenever Ian tried to incorporate a focus on self-defense into one of his classes, these same women were simply not interested.  Punching and kicking in an energized room pulsing with upbeat music and the whooping and hollering of their friends produced endorphins.  Punching and kicking as a defense against an attack – even a simulated one – produced adrenaline.  In short, his clients ran toward the pleasure and excitement (endorphins), and ran from the fear (adrenaline). 
 
This revelation got Ian thinking.  For kids, exercise for the sake of exercise is hard work and drudgery and most parents have a fight on their hands getting their kids to participate.  If Ian could figure out a way to introduce exercise to kids disguised in a fun, endorphin-producing package, he would be a hero to all parents concerned with the health and happiness of their children.  Within days of this light bulb moment MacXTag was born!
 

Extensive R&D on MacXTag has taken place

 
The first prototype for MacXTag had its issues, but we knew we were onto a winner. 

 
That's right, Ben, even Edison started somewhere
We immediately set about patenting our concept and gear, and trademarking the MacXTag name. Research and development continued, resulting at times in gear that was – shall we say – interesting.

 
Hey, Rachel, Rocky the Squirrel has been looking for that haa
Hook and loop was a major ingredient in the design of the MacXTag gear.  We experimented with different thicknesses and strengths, and spent hours in MacXTag classes with kids, testing and retesting the equipment.

This much hook and loop and Nate will stick to anything
 
With seamstresses and engineers working around the clock, the MacXTag gear changed, evolved and improved until the gear was complete.
 

 
Now we are getting somewhere, right Lauren?
 
 

Now that we had a working model, we set about designing the introductory MacXTag Lite kit.  This simple design provides everything we need: it's lightweight, completely functional and easy to pull on and off.

With the additional money we could complete the project without making any drastic cut.5) We would love to add Oculus Rift implementation for the game, since we believe that it would fit perfectly with the overall tone of “Forgive Me”.- 45.000€   1 more 3D artist and 1 more Composer.- 55.000€   1 more 3D artist, 1 more programmer and 1 more Composer.- 65.000€   2 more 3D artists, 1 more programmer and 1 more Composer. - 80.000€   2 more 3D artists, 1 more programmer, 1 more 2D artist and 1 more Composer.- 100.000€   1 more programmer and 1 more 2D artist15€ Early Digital Edition – The Game (digital Copy). 20€ Digital Edition – The Game, Soundtrack (digital copy) + Your name as a Backers (Credits).30€ Digital Deluxe Edition – The Game, Soundtrack, Ryan Gibson Postcard (digital copy) + Your name as a Backers (Credits).80€ Collector's Edition – The Game, Soundtrack, Artbook and Ryan Gibson Postcard (physical copy) + Your name as a Backers (Credits).160€ Extreme Edition – The Game, Soundtrack, Artbook, Ryan Gibson Postcard, T-Shirt (physical copy) + Your name as a Backers (Credits and Artbook).300€ Please, Forgive Me Edition - The Game, Soundtrack, Artbook, T-Shirt, Charlotte Buchant Postcard, The Comic Book (art by Davide Pascutti) Prequel the game (physical copy) + Your name as a Backers (Credits and Artbook).1) When will a demo be released? - We planned the official release of a demo by the third week of May 2014.2) How many hours will the game last? - The length will vary from player to player but we estimated that it would go between the two and five hours. If we manage to reach the necessary stretch goals, a couple more hours of gameplay are expected.3) What does the game actually consist of? - Forgive Me is a fantasy adventure set in an open environment, completely explorable from the beginning of the game.4) The game’s formula isn’t new, how does “Forgive me” stand out from the crowd? - The main value of forgive me is its subject, an uneasy topic that we hope will keep you engaged from the beginning to the end of the story. There won’t be any fights, but you’ll have to reach the solution before your soul is completely lost.5) Will there be any obstacles preventing me from reaching the end? - As we said before, even if our character is already dead, there is a Game Over. Your soul is not immortal and needs sustenance from the NPC located in the world in order to reach the end of the fame.6) What languages will be supported at launch? - The game will have Italian and English text from the beginning. With the stretch goals we’d like to add French and German, together with Italian and English voiceover.7) When will it be released? - We believe that with your support the game will be ready by the end of 2014, but should we reach the higher stretch goals we  may need to postpone it to 2015.The true power of crowdfunding is the possibility of including you, those for whom we are making this game with great love and passion, in the process. So, if you want to contact us please do so on our email, or on our profiles on Twitter and Facebook. Fabiano will answer personally your every question.http://forgivemegame.comgangstergames@forgivemegame.com",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Victory decided by skill. Not track memorization!</strong></h3>
<p>Why do people generally not want to play racing games when visiting their friends? In a traditional racing game, you are given a quantity of preset tracks. As a player, you are going to play this track over and over again. Invariably, you’re going to memorize the track.</p>
<p>In Velocity Stream, one player takes control of the Paver, a spacecraft that leaves a trail of energy in its wake. It’s on this trail that the other players race. This unique mechanic results in a brand new track being created by a human player in each race. Hence not only creating an infinite amount of tracks, but also resulting in the elimination of track memorization.</p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Do you refuse to keep on racing when you know you’ve already lost?</strong></h3>
<p>In Velocity Stream, we’ve got a new and exciting feature called the Activator Mode. Once you’ve lost, you are placed in the back of the Paver. Here you can place out obstacles and zip pads for the remaining racers to hit or avoid. We are also experimenting with a range of different activator modes, such as a fighter jet mode where players get to shoot down the Paver or annoy the Racers.</p>

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Do you think it’s a chore and a bore to wait in lobbies, waiting for a race to start?</strong></h3>
<p>In most racing games, when you want to join a race online, you enter a lobby and then wait for enough players to join. And if you’ve got bad luck, people drop out at the same pace that they join, not to mention that a lot of people drop during races as well. With Velocity Stream, we have the philosophy of zero downtime. To achieve this, players will join the match of their preference and are immediately placed in the Activator mode, while waiting for the next race, which commences without returning to the lobby.</p>

<p>     The Hall of Game is raising funds to finance a basketball and chess tournament.

<p><strong>     </strong>The <strong>chess philosophy</strong> teaches them to <strong>think strategically about the move they make before they make it. </strong>This is extremely relevant because we all make mistakes, however some are catastrophic because we reacted before we thought about the decision that was made.</p>
<p>     The <strong>basketball tournament</strong> promotes<strong> interpersonal communication by utilizing team work.</strong> ""There is no I in team"" and to be productive in life we must learn how to thrive and get along with others.

<p>Year 2022: society has truly changed during the last decade, the good old times have vanished. Help Max to survive through this unusual and hilarious adventure. For iOS and Android.</p>
<p><em>The Great Fusion</em> is a third person graphic adventure inspired by our childhood’s old classic point and click games. It has been touch optimised for mobile devices.</p>

<li>Spicy dialogues</li>

<h3>The Game: Tired of 1st person shooters?</h3>
<p>We have personally spent really great times playing old classic graphic adventure games such as <em>Monkey Island</em> or <em>Day Of The Tentacle</em>. Those funny conversations, the story interaction with other characters… It was a unique and unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>Our first priority has always been to make a funny and alternative game regarding current issues and problems. In addition to this, we have developed an intuitive and fresh interface in order to make the best possible experience. The gameplay idea is basically the same than our childhood’s classic graphic adventure games. It's not about being a hero, nor about dominating the world. <em>The Great Fusion</em> throws you into one of the plausible futures towards which society is unfortunately going straight to. How would you deal with it?</p>

What is all about The Great Fusion?
Year 2022: society has truly changed during the last decade, the good old times have vanished. Help Max to survive through this unusual and hilarious adventure. For iOS and Android.
The Great Fusion is a third person graphic adventure inspired by our childhood’s old classic point and click games. It has been touch optimised for mobile devices.

Hilarious story
Spicy dialogues
Hand-drawn art
Original Soundtrack



 
 


The Game: Tired of 1st person shooters?
We have personally spent really great times playing old classic graphic adventure games such as Monkey Island or Day Of The Tentacle. Those funny conversations, the story interaction with other characters… It was a unique and unforgettable experience.
Our first priority has always been to make a funny and alternative game regarding current issues and problems. In addition to this, we have developed an intuitive and fresh interface in order to make the best possible experience. The gameplay idea is basically the same than our childhood’s classic graphic adventure games. It's not about being a hero, nor about dominating the world. The Great Fusion throws you into one of the plausible futures towards which society is unfortunately going straight to. How would you deal with it?

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Video game journalism is plagued by people who don't understand the audience they're writing for. Far too often, we see people who don't know the first thing about the industry plastered all over our TV screens and websites. They're paid to look good on camera while holding a controller or reading a game review someone else wrote. The event that suffers from this the most is E3. Since it's closed to the public, we have no choice but to spend each year watching pretty faces drone on about their exclusive access to some game they obviously have no interest in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>The best way to solve this problem is to provide the gamers who truly care with coverage that meets their standards and matches their style. Giving the readers a hand in the creative process will allow for content that appeals to a more focused audience, satisfying communities that have demanded a more direct connection with E3 and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've partnered with the fantastic team at <a href=""http://gematsu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Gematsu</a> to gain access to the show and press conferences. In return, I'm going to be producing content for their site while covering the event as a volunteer. This will give me enough material to provide separate articles for my blog, which will be written during my free time before and after the show hours when all of my Gematsu work is completed. The only thing standing in my way is actually getting there. A flight across the country and a week's stay in California isn't cheap, and while I would love nothing more than to provide my services for free, financing the such a trip is an issue. If you can send me to California, each person who contributes $10 or more will become part of my team of editors that controls the types and topics of content I produce over the course of E3. By helping me, you're allowing me to reach out directly to the gaming community and allow access and influence to conference coverage and articles. Ten $50 contributors will even get to select a piece of my E3 swag to keep!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Along with the location requested by each article's backer, I will post my content on the <a href=""http://www.expobytheplayers.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Blog"">blog</a> I created for this project. The link can also be found under ""Website"" at the bottom of this description.</p>

obstacles all the time, and you have to overcome them to be successful.
While there are many of these obstacles along the road, we believe we can overcome them and be the best we can be.  Even if we don't get funded, we won't give up on our dream.
""Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts."" -Winston Churchill
Another big risk is not getting the funds we need.  Dogs of Combat may not look as compelling and innovative as other shooters, but we can make it better.  And, that's why we need your support so we make Dogs of Combat a game that everyone can enjoy on their iPhones and iPads.  

Crowdfunding isn't crowdfunding without awesome rewards for our backers!  With the exception of one physical reward, all of our rewards are 100% digital.  Yep, that's right! This is so that we can focus more on porting Dogs of Combat to iOS than shipping more physical rewards.  A few things to keep in mind about our rewards:
All digital reward tiers ship worldwide (some will be sent by email)
Sticker Man is only available in the United States and will not be included with rewards shipping outside the United States.

We will keep all backers updated with estimated delivery times
We do not charge shipping fees










If you just can't contribute, but still want to see Dogs of Combat on the App Store, you can still help us! Here's what you can do:
Spread the word about this campaign
Post it on social networks using the share tools


It would mean a lot to us if you did either of these things!

<p>Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for <strong>Archangel 2: Red Colony</strong>, an original full 3D space Point &amp; Click quest adventure game by indie development team comprised of two members.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/93770/files/20130924144748-fans4.gif?1380059268"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The purpose of the campaign is to make a sequel for the first part <strong>Archangel: Martian Orbit</strong>, that almost ready without any help from the side. You will see the first part final product for Android mobile devices before this campaign ends. So, you can try (for free!) and decide if the sequel is worth your attention and help.</p>
<p><img alt=""Story"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.archangelgame.net/indie/pic1new.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>As game designer I started to create 3d models and game environment on October 2012, without any possibility to work only on my project. But it was a Dream - to make something like this and to show for large people auditory the final result - new look of interactive Point &amp; Click mobile game.</p>
<p>Archangel episodes originally oriented for mobile devices, at least the first part. Its alternative historical event, reproduced in Point &amp; Click sci-fi quest adventure game. </p>
<p>In the first part of the game that almost ready, you play as the last awaken crew member on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DG6zPW5ZxI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Spaceship model"">Archangel soviet spaceship</a>. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Most things were created different than ""regular"" Point &amp; Click quest. We tried to make much more flexibility for gameplay and the game interactivity. How?</span></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> All scenes are fully modeled and rendered in 3d software allowing more options to move. You have huge spaceship to explore, four completed decks with at least 20 original sections. The main puzzle is the spaceship itself. While in a sequel - martian surface with its structures will be the main puzzle to solve.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Each action that your character do - all in movie clips. And you can see your hands, feel your body. You have total of 141 movies in the first part of the game. In a sequel will be less movies, but each movie much longer.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Mission is not so linear, you can decide and try different ways and devices, not every movie is a must, some of them can be played unlimited times for fun.</p>

<p><img alt=""Developers team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.archangelgame.net/indie/we.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>There are only two of us:</p>
<p><strong>Dmitry</strong> - game creator, responsable for all 3d aspects of design, animation and render processes. For this moment, sound and music in the game are also in my sphere of work.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong> - an experienced programmer, which can take all this mess of hundreds images, movie clips, schemes and soundtracks to create the final product on MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.</p>
<p>We are not working in the same office or even country, but our team is strong enough for creating nice projects without negative affects from secondary conditions. You can see - it works!</p>
<p><img alt=""Why crowdfunding?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.archangelgame.net/indie/why.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>Well, about 10 month of work on Archangel's first part and its ready to go! Actually, it can be done much more faster, I will explain that point later. So, why the sequel needs funds?</p>
<p>For now, we have not enough time to make it, we need to work for family, bills and food. We can't stay away from the other jobs. The second part of Archangel will take years to develop without any financial help or significant changes. So, if you think it worth and you want to help, check out the plan for the sequel.</p>
<p>Now its clear what can be done better in a sequel, or more correctly to say - different. You can find <a href=""http://archangelgame.net/next.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""What's next?"">some info</a> also on the game site, but here are few points:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Game zone will be significally changed - not only closed environment like rooms and sections, but also miles of the martian surface. Like a desert? No.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Martian surface will be represented in 3d world according to NASA's footages of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(region_of_Mars)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Cydonia region"">Cydonia region</a>. At least 4 different locations - Martian Face, Soviet colony and Pyramids area. Forth location is another human colony from the past with its features (see Astronaut perk for more details). Interiors and exterior zones. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> There will be <a href=""http://youtu.be/Pc5vBPw88VY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Characters"">another characters</a> for interaction, not only you and robots like it was before in part one. Friend(s) from Archangel spaceship, hostile cybernetic systems (from Earth), another nations astronaut(s).</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> This time - no silence. The characters can speak and interact.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Space suits will be redesigned for several versions with advanced textures and better animation flexibility. Few space transports will be also available.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Creation of realistic faces for the characters. Every emotion, speech, yell etc. will work in the game.</p>
<p>During this development, George will assist me with programming solutions and the best options that I will need for innovations and game requirements. At the final step, George will create again his unique engine in Unity3d.</p>
<p>Generally, a lot of  options can be done, we can't mention each of them, its a matter of imagination and project time. But, <strong><em>important to</em></strong><em><strong> remember</strong></em>, that the sequel will be the same Point &amp; Click quest game, available for <strong>mobile devices</strong> (priority), <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>Mac</strong> and <strong>Lunix</strong>. </p>
<p><img alt=""My investment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.archangelgame.net/indie/money.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><span>Our campaign is for flexible funding, so every dollar will be used for game creating progress, with possibility to pay the bills and food for several months. <strong>First step</strong> (me) - concepts, scenario, modeling and 3d environment render for images and animations. <strong>Second step</strong> (George) - interface adaptation, multilanguage versions, code for several platforms. <strong>Third step</strong> (both) - testing processes, upgrades and corrections, marketing, promotional material (trailer, site, press), music and sound.</span></p>
<p><span>To be honest, we need much more funds to make this kind of game, but we are estimating additional income from the almost completed Archangel's first part sellings. Anyway, here is a list of priorities:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>1.</strong> My work is at least for 4-5 months to create all 3d game scenes and characters: models, textures, rigging, animations and renders (<strong>about $15 000</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2.</strong> George need about 3 months to create the code in Unity and suit it on multiple platforms. Tests and so on... (<strong>about $15 000</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>3.</strong> The most significant time loss while working on <strong>Archangel: Martian Orbit</strong> was the render process of thousands frames for animation. So, in fact, all models and animated scenes were ready on January (first 4 month of work), then about 5 month of almost non-break rendering process on one machine. </span></p>
<p><span>Same situation can happen again with the sequel. If we reach our goal - strong computer especially for render purposes can be purchased, so the game development will be much faster, release earlier.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>4.</strong> This time we need third-party to be involved - Sound records studio.

<h3>Thanks and welcome aboard!</h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for Archangel 2: Red Colony, an original full 3D space Point & Click quest adventure game by indie development team comprised of two members.



The purpose of the campaign is to make a sequel for the first part Archangel: Martian Orbit, that almost ready without any help from the side. You will see the first part final product for Android mobile devices before this campaign ends. So, you can try (for free!) and decide if the sequel is worth your attention and help.

As game designer I started to create 3d models and game environment on October 2012, without any possibility to work only on my project. But it was a Dream - to make something like this and to show for large people auditory the final result - new look of interactive Point & Click mobile game.
Archangel episodes originally oriented for mobile devices, at least the first part. Its alternative historical event, reproduced in Point & Click sci-fi quest adventure game. 
In the first part of the game that almost ready, you play as the last awaken crew member on Archangel soviet spaceship. Most things were created different than ""regular"" Point & Click quest. We tried to make much more flexibility for gameplay and the game interactivity. How?
1. All scenes are fully modeled and rendered in 3d software allowing more options to move. You have huge spaceship to explore, four completed decks with at least 20 original sections. The main puzzle is the spaceship itself. While in a sequel - martian surface with its structures will be the main puzzle to solve.
2. Each action that your character do - all in movie clips. And you can see your hands, feel your body. You have total of 141 movies in the first part of the game. In a sequel will be less movies, but each movie much longer.
3. Mission is not so linear, you can decide and try different ways and devices, not every movie is a must, some of them can be played unlimited times for fun.
For more details, idea & game guide, screenshots and full list of features - you can visit game site or check out gameplay simulation. Demo-version for Android is now available - see updates!





There are only two of us:
Dmitry - game creator, responsable for all 3d aspects of design, animation and render processes. For this moment, sound and music in the game are also in my sphere of work.
George - an experienced programmer, which can take all this mess of hundreds images, movie clips, schemes and soundtracks to create the final product on MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.
We are not working in the same office or even country, but our team is strong enough for creating nice projects without negative affects from secondary conditions. You can see - it works!

Well, about 10 month of work on Archangel's first part and its ready to go! Actually, it can be done much more faster, I will explain that point later. So, why the sequel needs funds?
For now, we have not enough time to make it, we need to work for family, bills and food. We can't stay away from the other jobs. The second part of Archangel will take years to develop without any financial help or significant changes. So, if you think it worth and you want to help, check out the plan for the sequel.
Now its clear what can be done better in a sequel, or more correctly to say - different. You can find some info also on the game site, but here are few points:
1. Game zone will be significally changed - not only closed environment like rooms and sections, but also miles of the martian surface. Like a desert? No.
2. Martian surface will be represented in 3d world according to NASA's footages of Cydonia region. At least 4 different locations - Martian Face, Soviet colony and Pyramids area. Forth location is another human colony from the past with its features (see Astronaut perk for more details). Interiors and exterior zones. 
3. There will be another characters for interaction, not only you and robots like it was before in part one. Friend(s) from Archangel spaceship, hostile cybernetic systems (from Earth), another nations astronaut(s).
4. This time - no silence. The characters can speak and interact.
5. Space suits will be redesigned for several versions with advanced textures and better animation flexibility. Few space transports will be also available.
6. Creation of realistic faces for the characters. Every emotion, speech, yell etc. will work in the game.
During this development, George will assist me with programming solutions and the best options that I will need for innovations and game requirements. At the final step, George will create again his unique engine in Unity3d.
Generally, a lot of  options can be done, we can't mention each of them, its a matter of imagination and project time. But, important to remember, that the sequel will be the same Point & Click quest game, available for mobile devices (priority), PC, Mac and Lunix. 
Our campaign is for flexible funding, so every dollar will be used for game creating progress, with possibility to pay the bills and food for several months. First step (me) - concepts, scenario, modeling and 3d environment render for images and animations. Second step (George) - interface adaptation, multilanguage versions, code for several platforms. Third step (both) - testing processes, upgrades and corrections, marketing, promotional material (trailer, site, press), music and sound.
To be honest, we need much more funds to make this kind of game, but we are estimating additional income from the almost completed Archangel's first part sellings. Anyway, here is a list of priorities:
1. My work is at least for 4-5 months to create all 3d game scenes and characters: models, textures, rigging, animations and renders (about $15 000)
2. George need about 3 months to create the code in Unity and suit it on multiple platforms. Tests and so on... (about $15 000)
3. The most significant time loss while working on Archangel: Martian Orbit was the render process of thousands frames for animation. So, in fact, all models and animated scenes were ready on January (first 4 month of work), then about 5 month of almost non-break rendering process on one machine. 
Same situation can happen again with the sequel. If we reach our goal - strong computer especially for render purposes can be purchased, so the game development will be much faster, release earlier.
4. This time we need third-party to be involved - Sound records studio. They will have not so much work to do - only multiple short dialogues/emotions between characters according to the scenes. We need the same high-quality result, so the price can vary around estimated $2500. Sound and music can be done separately like before by our own possibilities. 
5. Some part of money will be spend for you, our friends. Digital and hand-made exclusive presents for backers. Free shipping worldwide.
6. Fees... 
* Game trailer, site and all graphic needs can be done by me, no need to pay to nobody else. At this stage you will start to see your names on ""Hall of Glory"" page - created especially for the people who helped us here with our project.
If we have a luck and get above what we ask for - where the money go:

Party with cakes for me and George on Skype conversation.
Just joking. More powerfull render station(s) can be purchased - see next point.
Game scenario can be extended for more exciting zones and characters modeling. In addition, mega-cool effects in 3d and video, still on time schedule, because render station processes run fast. Only one limit - game size. It can't be 1 GB for mobile devices.
Additional software like ZBrush can be purchased and used for better result in characters look. Plus may be couple weeks to timeline for studying these tools (online).
Professional composer can be hired for several needs.
Extra-present for everyone who participated in our campaign.
We are always open to receive your feedback and change these plans if it seems right step to all of us. 


As you can see from descriptions, your perk can be very special and unique, you will be not only listed on the game site, but also with possibility to affect the game and influence storyline. In addition, if it seems campaign running to pass its goal - there is an option to extra-present for at least officers staff - hand-made high-quality medal of honor. 
Important note: perks including shipping price - registered package with number, so you can track your order. All life examples of physical gifts like key-holder, medals, Archangel character figure will be represented here for your evaluation of quality and look.



Another note: everybody who helped, doesn't matter how much - will be listed in ""Hall of Glory"".

<h3>""What is Warbird Games?""</h3>
Hi, I'm Stacy Davidson, lead designer at<a href=""http://www.warbirdgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Warbird Games Official Site""><strong> Warbird Games! </strong></a>We are a Dallas area-based indie game studio that exists as a collection of artists of various breeds working both locally and remotely.  We each bring unique skills in the areas of game design, dramatic writing, traditional art, 3D animation, sculpting/molding, practical and visual motion picture effects, sound design, acting and vocal direction, and music composition and recording.
<p>Since I am at the core of this team, I thought I would start by giving you a little background on myself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>""Stacy Who?""</h3>
<p>My love of computer games began when I was eight years old with the introduction of a TI-99/4A computer in the household. I learned Extended Basic and programmed my first game, a simple text adventured called <em>The Quest</em> where the player could pick up a sword and lantern, explore a swamp and castle, and little else! I later developed simple action and RPG games on my dual C64 &amp; C128 systems and ran a local C64 gaming BBS. I played my first graphic adventure game on my 286, where I experienced <em>Space Quest III</em> and <em>IV</em>, <em>King’s Quest V</em> and <em>VI</em>, <em>Conquest of Camelot</em> and many more<em>.</em></p>
<p>As I upgraded, I fell in love with games like <em>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</em>, <em>Full Throttle</em>, and finally the adventure game that convinced me that anything was possible in the genre: the beautiful and haunting sci-fi masterpiece<em> The Dig.</em></p>
<p>As an avid gamer, I have owned a dozen game systems and even enjoy fixing up old arcade machines and collect boxes of arcade boards.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I spent a year in QA at <strong>Origin Systems/EA</strong> during their last days, published my own shareware game <em>Shadow of the Lost Citadel</em>, and have spent the last eleven years working in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1924108/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">motion pictures</a> as a producer, director, cinematographer, editor, sound designer and visual effects supervisor at my own studio, <a href=""http://www.odysseepictures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Odyssee Pictures</a>.</p>
<p>Returning to games really feels like going back to my roots. I spent many years living and breathing games, and the prospect of designing multiple adventure games would be nothing short of a dream come true for me. To this end, I’ve now set my sites on the point ‘n click world, starting with my lifelong pet project idea<em> <a href=""http://www.hansoloadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Han Solo Adventures"">Han Solo Adventures</a></em>, a purely “for fun” fan-game idea I’ve been recently making a reality.</p>
<p>However, under the banner of <strong>Warbird Games</strong>, I’m looking forward to exploring original ideas in my neverending quest to recapture the glory days of<strong> Sierra On-Line</strong> and <strong>LucasArts</strong>, where mysteries were solved and legends were born one click at a time!</p>
<h3>""What's the money for?""</h3>
<p>Warbird Games is just now in it's infancy, and we need to get cracking on every front. By pre-ordering our first title, you will be helping us do things like:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Visualize our concepts through terrific artwork and clay maquettes.</li>
<li>Develop the design bible and expand every detail so assets can be created.</li>
<li>Produce an exciting old-time radio drama podcast to help introduce our sci-fi universe.</li>
<li>Buy us time to work, because time is money!</li>
<li>Most importantly, prove that players are hungry for new adventure games in the vein of the Sierra and LucasArts classics we all remember and love!</li>
</ul>
<h3>""What will your first game be like?""</h3>
<p>Jack Houston and the Necronauts is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A serious <strong>point 'n click adventure game</strong> in the vein of <strong>Full Throttle</strong> and <strong>The Dig</strong>.</li>
<li>A pulpy, two-fisted, bubble helmets, rockets 'n rayguns <strong>sci-fi</strong> story in the tradition of <strong>Edgar Rice Burroughs</strong> and <strong>Frank Frazetta</strong>.</li>
<li>Set in the world of 1999 as envisioned by early 20th century sci-fi writers and artists like Chesley Bonestell.</li>
<li>An exercise in a rarely used, non-traditional animation technique with <strong>ZERO</strong> computer generated animation!</li>
</ul>
<h3>""So what do I get?""</h3>
<p>For the low early bird price of $15, you will be entitled to our very first game title as a DRM-FREE digital download.</p>
<p>At higher levels, you will also recieve additional perks such as the soundtrack and a high quality making-of book with tons of full color artwork and behind-the-scenes images along with a complete journal of the game design.</p>
<p>In addition, as a backer, you will recieve special access to our private video dev blogs and development community where you will be ranked ""Early Bird"" forever, along with our gratitude for being the first to help us spread our wings and take flight!</p>
<p>Please help us spread the word by facebooking, tweeting, or sending this URL by way of carrier pigeon to the entire world!</p>

<p>Indiegogo only allows a minimum of $500 for our campaign. As a result, after the above mentioned site expenses are taken care of we will use any left over money to purchase prizes and incentives. These prizes would be given to contributors as a thank you and as prizes for site contests.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>At TheROMShop.com we work hard to provide the best service possible. We offer thousands of free games and the applications to play them on your Mac or PC. We also have a members site at ROMGamer.net, that offers bundlepaks and rare ROM files not found elsewhere. We offer free support and troubleshooting to our users and strive to continue to maintain ourselves as an excellent resource for retro and nostalgic gaming. Our Facebook community of over 7K strong enjoys a daily schedule of entertaining posts in their news feed that was painstaking built by volunteers. We've done all this without charging a cent for any service and refusing to resort to smearing our sites with ads and pop-ups like most of the other ROM sites out there. All this bandwidth, web hosting and more doesn’t come free and unfortunately the minimal advertising that does exist on our site does not cover operating costs. In an effort to stay active beyond our current domain expiry date, we are reaching out to the public for support. No contribution is too small, you can also rest assured your donation will be wisely used and greatly appreciated.</p>

We are a small group of developers, designers, and artists, located in Los Angeles who want to make creative and useful applications that are inspired. Our designs are unique and innovative. We do this because, well, what else would we do?!

We do this because THIS is our passion! 

However,
""The road to success is not always paved with gold,"" and in this case it is very true; we need your help. 

My partner Jason's wife recently gave birth to two beautiful babies (July 14th 5pm), and time has run out to take things slow. That is why it is so important that we find a way to make this project a success otherwise we may need to shut down shop. I don't want this to happen.


Our Goal


If we can raise enough money to support our team to develop this project we will accomplish several things
- We will create a fun and unique game with loads of character!
- We will make Gengius a success.)
- So many more ideas/applications will be possible for our team to share with the app community whom we know will find them useful and entertaining. (Our team is talented and has experience, what we lack are resources)


What will it take and How can you Help?
The projected cost for ""Zebop's Escape"" is based on an engineering plan that includes the cost of our engineers, our artists, our designers, our composers, marketing, and our QA Team over the 2 months it will take to complete
the project. 

There are various perks available depending on the contribution which can be viewed in the right column.
Perks are available to anyone who supports the making of this game.



Additional Ways You Can Help?
If you have the time or inclination let people know about the app and have them download and play it. Also, if you know any generous individuals who would wish to support us please send them a link to our campaign as I am sure that would probably be the easiest way for them to get the information.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is <strong>James Dance</strong> and I am the owner of <em>Loading</em> bar, a gaming café and cocktail bar based in the Southwest of England.</p>
<p>After graduating I came up with the idea to open my own gaming venue. I worked full time as a chef and I filled my spare time with research and development for a new type of gaming bar.</p>
<p>In 2010, after three years of inhuman hours and after sacrificing both my social life and sanity, Loading bar opened its doors, offering gamers a place to drink, relax and play.</p>

<p>My business is unique in its take on the “Gaming bar” format for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of our consoles is free, as is access to the internet.</li>
<li>Gaming cafe during the day, gaming bar during the night.</li>

<p>We want to create a bar run by people focused on the venue not the profit margins, in London; The centre of the UK games industry. We would like to take the successful format we have down here in Cornwall and move it to the capital where we can serve a greater number of people as well as offering unique, industry sponsored events in a fit to purpose venue.</p>
<p>We will be Collaborating with Mitch and <a href=""http://thedrunkenmoogle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Drunken Moogle</a> to help curate drinks and Daniella from <a href=""gourmetgaming.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gourmet Gaming</a> to help lay on game themed snacks.</p>
<p>London based <strong>Nintendisco</strong> now <strong>Gamerdisco</strong> will be bringing their monthly ‘arcade for adults’ approach to the bar once a month as well, the aim really is to create a centre point venue for all things gaming culture in the UK and beyond.</p>
<p>We also want YOU to get involved to help us create something new and community driven.</p>
<p>Your support and contributions will ensure that London gets its first dedicated gaming venue. There are a few bars with consoles and a couple of competetive gaming centres in the UK but Loading is a different beast altogether; A celebration of the social side of gaming. Somewhere you can just come and spend time with your friends, grab a drink and play a few rounds of Mario-kart should you feel like it, no payment, no pressure.</p>

<p>The more eagle eyed (or prone to google) among you may be thinking “$50,000 is NOT enough to open a venue in London” and you would be correct.</p>
<p>The money will be used to allow us to secure the rest of the funding needed to make the project a reality. We already have the design, concept and experience and have been successfully running it on a smaller scale for two years, we know what we are doing and have already ironed out the bumps down here in Cornwall.</p>
<p>We will also be saving money by taking over the lease of one of the many pubs that are closing down in the city. These classic London pubs are perfect for two things; avoiding hordes of marauding zombies and developing into gaming venues.</p>
<p>Doing it this way rather than from the ground up not only saves us a bunch of cash, it also means that we avoid pricey and time consuming planning processes and issues.</p>

<p>We chose Indie-gogo because it is perfect because regardless of the outcome, we still get to deliver our perks to you, the supporters.</p>
<p>We are committed to this project and are determined that we WILL open in London one way or another. Having achieved what we have so far on a practically non-existent budget we can assure you that this project will happen even if we do not reach our target, it will just take a whole while longer.</p>
<p>All of the perks will still be valid including our drinks vouchers; you can use them at our bar in Cornwall, at any of our promotional events or just keep them as a keepsake as they will fold out into limited edition papercraft projects.</p>
<h3>Why we think this is important:</h3>
<p>As far as the gaming community goes, this project is valuable as it gives you, the community, a focal point, a place to gather and catch up whilst also having a damn good time.</p>
<p>On a grander scale, we feel it is important that venues like this start to be taken seriously. Places like Loading help legitimise gaming both as an adult activity and a genuine art form.</p>
<p>This is a space for collaboration and co-operation, a place you can be proud to be a part of and actively have a say in how it evolves on a day by day basis.</p>

With your help we're going to launch a 3-4 world 'Episodic' version of the game. Thank you SO MUCH for your support and welcome to the team!We started this journey with a simple dream. To create a love song to the history of video games by combining the graphics of every generation. We also wanted to offer console quality controls on touch screen devices, without the use of a D-Pad.
The title says it all. Super Adventure Mega Quest combines elements from numerous classic titles into one vision. With our new control scheme we've dubbed 'D-Padless', you can finally experience perfect platforming on a touch screen device.
In a far away world, not unlike our own, lied a happy planet. It was filled with creatures who all lived in harmony. Unless they were eating each other.Suddenly and without warning, a dark being who hated all things, de-pixalated the world. Reducing it to a monochrome nightmare.
Unable to cope with their low resolution, the animals of the forest began to revolt. It was then, when things looked their darkest, that a hero named Leonardo came to the rescue.
By spreading love around the land, he knew he could slowly return the pixels to the planet. Now his quest begins to track down the evil one who cannot be named! Whose name is Bill.
For the first time gamers will be able to experience precision controls on a touch screen device. We spent months fine tuning a new control system specifically for this title. The goal was to bring console platforming to the portable market.
There's no on screen buttons to obstruct your view. Tapping anywhere on the left side of the screen will change your player's direction. The right side of the screen is jump, or double jump. Controls so basic your grandmother could pick it up and play, but levels become increasingly difficult until mastery is required.
Every single level of SAMQ takes you through the history of video games. They start out looking like an old school gameboy game, and change dynamically in front of you as you power up by collecting hearts.The coolest thing about the dynamic changes is that certain secrets can only be found in specific resolutions. For example, you might find a key in the 1-Bit mode, and the door can only be found in the 16-bit mode. You can replay a beaten level in any resolution of your choosing to try and collect all the secrets.
An incredible team of some of todays most exciting artists are all composing an original soundtrack to SAMQ. Featuring  Dan Mangan,The Frederik, Alex Mind,Prototype Raptor,Ryan Enzed,  and Marc Remillard. Each level will feature four different compositions to match the different graphic styles.
Starting out with humble chip tunes, the music changes dynamically in front of you while you play. Slowly as you power up the resolution, the music simultaneously becomes more complex.
Here's a selection of samples from the first level to demonstrate the process.

Wander uses exploration, beauty, cooperation and transformation to give you a unique player experience. You begin life as a tree, brought to life by a mysterious and powerful flower and go through various transformations as you progress. The game encourages you to explore the beautiful world around you and discover others like you who work together and become new entities each with their own unique form and power. If you have ever wondered what it’d be like to soar the skies and feel the wind blow under your wings as a griffon, be one with nature as a noble ent or swim the depths of the ocean as a agile amphibian, you can find out in Wander.</span></p>

Instead players encounter challenges and puzzles that can be solved more easily with the cooperation of others. You can explore a lush rainforest and take in the gorgeous scenery, dive in the ocean or fly above the landscape, discovering other companions along the way who will share their discoveries. The idea is to relax in a non-competitive world and immerse yourself in the sounds and music carefully woven together to create an experience like no other. There are, however, unpredictable storms to be encountered and your success at this depends on your ability to work with others to find shelter and get your friends to them, where you can then ride out the storms.<br/><br/>Embark on a journey of discovery, form a fellowship and piece together the great mysteries waiting to be discovered in the worlds of Wander.</span></p>

<p> </p></div>","By helping to fund Wander, you are taking part in the development of a new concept in gaming. Wander uses exploration, beauty, cooperation and transformation to give you a unique player experience. You begin life as a tree, brought to life by a mysterious and powerful flower and go through various transformations as you progress. The game encourages you to explore the beautiful world around you and discover others like you who work together and become new entities each with their own unique form and power. If you have ever wondered what it’d be like to soar the skies and feel the wind blow under your wings as a griffon, be one with nature as a noble ent or swim the depths of the ocean as a agile amphibian, you can find out in Wander.
 

 
As Wander is all about co-operation, community and exploration, there is no combat in this game. Instead players encounter challenges and puzzles that can be solved more easily with the cooperation of others. You can explore a lush rainforest and take in the gorgeous scenery, dive in the ocean or fly above the landscape, discovering other companions along the way who will share their discoveries. The idea is to relax in a non-competitive world and immerse yourself in the sounds and music carefully woven together to create an experience like no other. There are, however, unpredictable storms to be encountered and your success at this depends on your ability to work with others to find shelter and get your friends to them, where you can then ride out the storms.Embark on a journey of discovery, form a fellowship and piece together the great mysteries waiting to be discovered in the worlds of Wander.
 
Wander is going to be released at PAX Australia, on the 19th of July 2013.

Wander is going to be released no matter how much funding we get, but it could be even better if we had some extra funds. Funds would go towards: 
 

Oculus Rift Dev Kit $300 (+$67 postage to Australia) *Goal Reached* - ""Oculus Rift is a new virtual reality (VR) headset designed specifically for video games. With an incredibly wide field of view, high resolution display, and ultra-low latency head tracking, the Rift provides a truly immersive experience that allows you to step inside your favorite game and explore new worlds like never before."" This sounds like exactly the kind of thing that would enhance the experience of Wander and make Wander a really unique experience for Rift owners.

Amplify Virtual Texturing $175 *Goal Reached* - Would mean we can have much higher quality textures, and reduce the memory requirements of Wander, so players with older machines can still play.


Triton Water, $475 - The default water in the game engine we are using isn't great, but writing a good water shader that is attractive and high performance is very hard. Triton is very good looking, the devs are friendly and the performance is great.

Additional copies of Unity $1500 / each - Would mean we could use additional machines for light mapping, which would cut baking times down considerably, allowing us to increase the quality of the lighting a lot.

Texturing tools $690 - allegorithmic’s Substance Designer and Bitmap2Material, would also make things easier for our texturing artists, speeding up asset creation. These are currently available as a special bundled deal for $690.

little bit of money for paying musicians to play instruments that we can't play would also make the sound track better, as we’re keen to use live musicians for the soundtrack. We already have a large collection of wonderful musicians donating their time; including guitarists, bassist, percussionist and vocalists. Our lead voice is a lyrical soprano opera singer.
 
 

Aaron, Anjay, Alex, Birrin, Chris, Daniel, David, David, Elaine, Garth, Jack, Joe, Justin, Loki, Sarah, Shelley, Sinead, Tadgh and YueYue are the Wander team. Members of the team have worked on many games before including major studio releases like My Little Pony and indie games like Dear Esther and Fruit Vs Robot.

Our Story


Ed Venture Studios is a bright new little game studio, focused on developing classic Point & Click Adventures.
Founded last month, we started to develop our first episodic game.





Till now, there is no Publisher in sight and my team of ten has to work hard on that Game at night after our regular work. To speed things up and being Independent, we need your help.

Help us funding the First Episode.

If ""Jerry McPartlin - Episode One"" could be made full time, it's just a little step to convince a publisher to get Jerry on the Road.

But what is Jerry all about?


Jerry McPartlin is a Rock 'n Roll star (wannabe). He lives in a typical American town in the late 50th. With teenagers, Cadillacs & Rock 'n Roll.
Jerry has an eye on Luna, the owner of the local diner. But he never told her, because she likes his rival Johnny Lash.
The day his brother Bobby, an excellent pilot and hobby archeologist, got the job to fly a customer into the desert of Arizona, Jerry's life changes forever.
When they are attacked by strangers just on discovering a hidden room in their parents' house, and forced to leave immediately, they slowly start to realize that there is no turning back.
Jerry Mc Partlin is a rocking, exciting and funny adventure filled with Rock 'n Roll.
It has a never-before-seen graphical style. Toony geometry, mixed with realistic textures & lightning.




(Work in progress)


Jerry McPartlin is planned to be released in six episodes.
The production costs of one episode is somewhere between $65.000 and $70.000
Jerry McPartlin will be voiced over in English and German. Subtitles are planned (Italian, Spanish, French).
It will feature a rocking an rolling soundtrack, performed by one of Germany's best Rock 'n Roll bands ""Hickory Cats"".




The Impact

We really want do that Game. And we want to do it right. So we need to drop our regular jobs, and start working full time and heart blooded, so that the first episode could already be released this summer. Episode 2-6 are planned to be released in a two month steps.
If we don't reach that goal, we wouldn't be able to finish the first episode in the next 12-18 months.



What We Need & What You Get
So as mentioned, we need 70.000$ to produce the first episode.


The money will be spent to monthly pay the team.
 
3D Artists
Story Designer
Sound Designer
Concept Art
Animator
Programmer
 
And also to do the synchronization in English and German, recording the ""Hickory Cats"", many other little things, and to be honest: Lots of coffee.
 
Every single dollar helps us, reaching that goal. Even, if we shouldn't reach the entire $70.000, the Project will be done. It would just need more time. So if you'd like us to speed up and don't want to wait several month till the next Episode is ready...

Even if you simply want to explore, all the 1950s environments are handcrafted to include a variety of puzzles, collectibles, and climbables.

Dozens of different enemies will stand in the way of your goal. While ants and rats may not be the smartest creatures, being swarmed by hordes of them will make life difficult.

Many years after being shut down Tyler is accidentally powered up during the height of a thunderstorm, you set off with Tyler to discover why your creator is missing and what has happened to your home, which is now overrun with robot-sized rats, cockroaches, and more.Size plays a huge part Tyler: Model-005. As Tyler, you are a miniscule machine. Pencils and coffee mugs can become weapons. Chairs, stairs and bookshelves are obstacles to your progress - things that are normal take on a completely new dimension in Tyler’s world. Even if you simply want to explore, all the 1950s environments are handcrafted to include a variety of puzzles, collectibles, and climbables. Details are important to breathe life into a game, and, as Tyler, it’s your role to find out as much as you can.But stairs aren’t your only obstacles. Dozens of different enemies will stand in the way of your goal. While ants and rats may not be the smartest creatures, being swarmed by hordes of them will make life difficult. Luckily, you and Tyler are equipped with a variety of different weapons, from your trusty bolt blade to boxing gloves. Samurai swords, Sticks! Cherry bombs! All of it will allow you to carve your way through the pests that have infested your home while your creator has been missing. Tyler’s relying on your help, so use every tool you discover to find the right combination for you.An important element we wanted to present to this Indiegogo was a playable demo of the very opening segment of the game - the Basement and a few of the early rooms. We didn’t want to give too much of the story away, but we wanted you to be able to try out the gameplay in Tyler.  Currently, the only section that has a degree of polish is the Basement, continuing play past that section may result in getting stuck or finding other weirdness.But that’s why we’re here on Indiegogo, to give the game a few more months of polish and shine before launching. We believe you’ll be able to get a sense of what the game will become and what sort of experiences you’ll enjoy as you explore. Check it out!Hi! I’m Tyler, the robot you’ve been reading about for the last few minutes. Running around with me looks pretty fun, right? My creator was a very, very smart man, and he gave me all sorts of different abilities that aren’t normal for a solar-powered robot. I mean, I guess solar-powered robots aren’t typical either. That reminds me - let me tell you a bit more about myself! Like I said before, any light source keeps me charged up. Running around rooms is dangerous, but it gets even worse if I’m in the dark. I can’t even imagine what it’s like in a dungeon - or a sewer! Finding light switches or kerosene lamps will let me do more exploring, which is what I like to do best. When I’m powered up, you can use my energy source to move objects like coffee mugs, pencils or boxes. I can even use these as bug crushers if I need to! I’m not the only robot my master made though, there’s quite a few of us running around, according to my mate, Conrad. I’m not sure if I trust that guy, but he seems sure that there’s a couple others tucked around my creator’s house. The more of them I run into the more I’ll be able to find out what happened to my creator!  And the coolest thing (which I’m not exactly sure how my creator managed to invent this) is the time shifting powers he gave me! I can travel back and forth through time - how cool is that?! So who knows, maybe I already know the answers to all my own questions and I just don’t want to give you any spoilers! Spoiler alert: Captain Picard totally killed Gandal with Dumbledore’s help. Luke Skywalker was there too. Hah!With his ability to time travel, Tyler is able to discover and wear a huge assortment of diverse outfits. Anything from medieval helmets to pixelated eyeglasses are possible, and you can see a large number of these in our trailer and throughout the GIFs on this Indiegogo. As a special gift for anyone that opts to back a tier level that includes a digital copy, we’re going to give you an exclusive “American Slasher” skin, which you can see below. It’s totally appropriate for Halloween! Other Indiegogo tiers also include additional customization options, allowing you to outfit Tyler however you’d like. While static images are great, we also wanted to give you an even more in-depth look at some of the customization options available to you, so we’ve utilized SketchFab - the online 3D model viewer - to create embeddable art for you to look at. Below you’ll find several of our different in-game outfits. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do.https://sketchfab.com/models/337f912e654748f984e6cf1def00809dhttps://sketchfab.com/models/a5e4d1e9d4794182be1c70992f44bea4Finally, we know that Tyler is awesome. Your journey with him will be chock full of personality. We think he’s pretty adorable, and we hope you do too. So as one of our Indiegogo perks, we’re including a 4” figurine of Tyler available. The Tyler statue is a high-quality full-color 3D print in a sandstone material. He’ll look great perched on the edge of your desk!Note: Tyler’s Statue is for decorative purposes only. We’d be sad if Tyler broke.Reversed Interactive is a very small team. Most of the development has been done out of pocket up until this point, and we fully anticipate to simply cover future costs with the funding you help us raise. However, we also know that Indiegogo can be a powerful platform and community, and we hope that - with your help - we can bring a fully realized amazing experience to gamers throughout the world.Although we’ve implemented many of the core features of the game, we know that the game needs more polish and additional content to match what exists in other action-adventure games on the market. We want to add more levels, animations, costumes, enemies, voice acting, and features into the final product, and that will only be possible with your help via this Indiegogo.Your funding will help us bring Tyler’s world to life and make it so you can fully immerse yourself in the novelty of running a tiny robot through a delipidated 1950s home.

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose for this campaign is to help development of Mech Merc Company be ready for Steam early access. Backers will get Steam pre-release keys so they can play the career mode as it is being created, and higher tier backers will be able to leave their mark on the game.</p>
<p>Mech Merc Company is meant to pay homage to the classic Mechwarrior titles of the 90's and early 2000's. The design is largely based on Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries with considerations from sequel titles. The gameplay will be playing missions, designing mechs, and managing your mercenary company. The target audience is those that want a more old school style hardcore mech simulation with complex mech designing and business management elements.</p>
<p>What sets Mech Merc Company apart is the mech customization is improvement on the best ideas from Mechwarrior games.  Some more advance mechanics have been added such as weapons supporting multiple ammo types, weapon modification system, laser arrays, and manual guided missiles.</p>
<p>This campaign is flexible, because I am promising that Mech Merc Company will be for sale on Steam as part of the early access program at some point in some state. Even after launching into early access it will require many more years of development to be a finished game.</p>
<p>At the end of the campaign emails will be sent out with the Steam keys and instructions for submitting materials related to pilots and factions.</p>

Achieving that classic look and feel is vitally important to us, which is why we've teamed up with legendary pixel artist <strong>Henk Nieborg</strong>, who previously worked on the Mega Drive title ""<strong>The Misadventures Of Flink</strong>"", developed by <strong>Psygnosis</strong>.</p><p>We're also working with ""<strong>Savaged Regime</strong>""; a highly renowned chip-tune artist that knows how to push the Mega Drive's <strong>YM2612</strong> chip to the limit - you can hear a sample of the Xeno Crisis soundtrack in the Kickstarter video above.</p><p>The game is currently at the <strong>prototype</strong> stage and we will be releasing the finished product in <strong>October 2018</strong> to coincide with the <strong>30th anniversary</strong> of the Mega Drive's launch in Japan.

Achieving that classic look and feel is vitally important to us, which is why we've teamed up with legendary pixel artist Henk Nieborg, who previously worked on the Mega Drive title ""The Misadventures Of Flink"", developed by Psygnosis.We're also working with ""Savaged Regime""; a highly renowned chip-tune artist that knows how to push the Mega Drive's YM2612 chip to the limit - you can hear a sample of the Xeno Crisis soundtrack in the Kickstarter video above.The game is currently at the prototype stage and we will be releasing the finished product in October 2018 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Mega Drive's launch in Japan. We're launching this Kickstarter campaign to fund the remainder of the title's development. The focus of Xeno Crisis' gameplay is the intense combat which pits you (and optionally another player) against thousands of alien enemies - players take control of a male or female marine capable of moving and shooting in 8 directions, and they can also perform an evasive roll to get out of tricky situations. If things get really desperate then a grenade can be deployed, destroy anything nearby, giving the player a brief moment of respite.Players have several weapons at their disposal, but ammo is limited so players must constantly be on the move, grabbing new weapons and extra ammo as they go. When a room has been cleared of all hostiles the player(s) can choose which exit to take, with the aim being to rescue any of the colony's inhabitants who might still be alive, and then progress to the area's boss. There are 6 areas in total, each with their own enemies, hazards, secrets and gameplay nuances.Every few enemies killed will result in a set of dog-tags being dropped - these can be collected and exchanged for upgrades between areas.Should the player run out of health they will be taken to the 'Continue' screen, where they can decide to continue the fight or start over - the player begins the game with 3 continues but more can be acquired between areas. If a player runs out of health in 2-player mode, that player will remain down until the end of the room, at which point they’ll be revived automatically.The arena shooter has seen something of a resurgence in recent years in the form of Geometry Wars, Enter The Gungeon, Nuclear Assault and The Binding Of Isaac, but the genre was defined back in the early 1980s through games such as Berzerk and Robotron: 2084. Xeno Crisis certainly takes inspiration from these great titles, and particularly Robotron's spiritual successor, Smash TV, utilising a similar game flow.We've expanded upon this popular and successful formula though by adding new elements which are better suited to console titles, such as the ability to backtrack, a keycard system, an equipment screen, procedural map generation and randomisation of enemies and pickups.A breakdown of Xeno Crisis' key features:

Intense arena-based combat where the player must constantly be on their toes, prioritising which enemies to engage next, and ensuring they don't run out of ammo.

Procedurally generated maps and rooms, so you never know what's coming up, and you have to adapt your tactics on a room-by-room basis.

Optional 2-player co-operative play, so you can take the fight to the enemy with a friend - just make sure you share the ammo!

6 diverse areas to explore, each with their own obstacles and hazards, and secrets, including The Outpost and The Nest:


Upgrade system which allows you to adapt the game to your style of play - are you a cautious player or more gung-ho?
An arsenal of 9 different weapons to switch things up and turn the tables in your favour.

6 intimidating bosses, each of which will demand you to learn a different strategy to defeat them.

Two modes of play; once you've completed the Arcade mode you can try your hand at the Infinite mode, where even veteran players will find a challenge.

Two difficulty levels; ""Rookie"" and ""Hardcorps"". Playing on Rookie will mean easier progress, but you won't be able to see the ""good"" ending!
As you progress through the colony you will come across many different enemies, each with their own traits and means of attack. Many of them can be gunned down without too much thought, but others will require the player to outflank them, attack them within a certain time window, or be avoided altogether! Here are the first few enemies you'll encounter:There are several weapons at your disposal, each with their own characteristics. Although your standard issue pulse rifle is perfectly capable of taking on the enemy, other weapons can give you advantages in certain situations, so picking them up is generally advisable - just don't run out of ammo!At the end of each area you will be given the chance to exchange any dog-tags you've collected for upgrades ranging from extra health to weapon power-ups to extra continues. Which upgrades you go for will depend on your style of play.Bitmap Bureau was formed early in 2016 with the intention of creating innovative and polished 2D games for desktops and consoles.

<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>For those of you sitting their wondering what in the world is Fungo Golf? Pay close attention, I'm going to give you a crash course in Fungo 101:<br/>
</div>
<p><br/></p>Basically Fungo Golf is a mix up of both golf and baseball. It's played with the same structure as Golf, except this game is played on a baseball field, with a Fungo bat, and a baseball. Just like when you play golf, the object is to hit your ball into a hole with as few swings as possible. Well, in Fungo golf it's the same idea, but instead of hitting your ball with a club into a hole you have to hit your ball off of certain targets on the field with a fungo bat. Many baseball players who've had to sit through rain delays or has had time between double headers know exactly what Fungo golf is all about. </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lets say hole #1 would be a sign on the outfield fence. The way you Tee off in this game is a little different than in traditional golf. In Fungo golf you have your bat in one hand, ball in the other and all you do is simply toss the ball up to yourself and swing away. Now from that point as long as you are close enough to the target, in this case the sign on the outfield fence. You have to ""Putt"" your ball just like in golf and try to hit your target. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> Score is kept the same way as you would keep it in golf. So every time you swing and hit your ball its considered a stroke, and at the end of the game the player with the least amount of strokes wins the game. There are many different variations of how people play it, but this is how we do it!</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> I am a recent graduate of William Paterson University in New Jersey, where I received a degree in Business management. I was also a four year starting pitcher for the Pioneers and an all-conference ""Fungo Golfer"". </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It was a little over a year ago, I had baseball practice on a Saturday morning. I got down to the field about an hour early, then a few minutes later, a few of my teammates showed up. I'm sitting there in the dugout and a few of the guys grabbed their fungos, and one by one started to tee off. As i'm sitting their watching them play, it hit me! I thought to myself this would be an awesome game to play against your friends right from your phone. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So I put pencil to paper and started sketching out what was in my head. As I tweaked the design concept of what I had in my mind, I was also going around campus networking, trying to find someone to join my one man team. Every day I would go to the computer labs, the computer science department, the student center, and the arcade. I met some really cool people, but everyone that I spoke to didn't have the time to help with their work and school schedule, didn't have the skills, or just told me to ""get lost, they were busy"". </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That didn't stop me though, playing baseball my entire life I'm not one to give up on anything!!! Plan B - was to try to find someone to invest in this idea and have it designed, and developed professionally.  I first reached out to my college pitching coach Scott Farber. I figured if anybody would see what I was seeing it would be this guy. He was an All American ball player in college, and although we didn't always see eye to eye on the field, we both had an amazing respect for each other off the field.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It took me about 5 months to actually get to meet with him in person. This was after the season had ended, and every time I reached out to him he was always in the middle of something, or on vacation, but he did seem interested in hearing what I wanted to tell him. So I continued to develop my story boards in more detail, and continued to call him once a week. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One morning I gave him a call, and he goes ""James meet me in my office at 10:30"". Without hesitation, I got in my car and drove out to meet him. He too dabbled in some Fungo Golf back in his day, so he knew exactly what I was talking about. He loved the idea, and agreed to help fund the development costs to take this from an idea into a product on the market. The next day I reached out to my development team and we started to build the game. I can not begin to thank him enough for believing not only in my idea but believing in me as well. Farbs once again you are the man!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>Why come to Indiegogo?</b>
</h2>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Like I said before, I am a business guy, that's what I went to school for. Although I have a very creative mind, drawing and programming really aren't my strong suit. As of right now all of the work that has been done has been made ""work-for-hire"" and contracted out professionally. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">As you scroll down you will see hiring a designer and programmer to come up with the designs of new fields, characters, and actually taking that artwork and bringing it to life does not come cheap. And all of the start up funds I had, have all dried up. Which is why we need your help to continue development and really take this game to the next level!</div>

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Child's Play works in two ways - with the help of the hospital staff, they set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. With the help of donations they also purchase new  consoles, peripherals, and games for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow children to interact with their peers, friends, and family, and  provide an awesome distraction from an otherwise unpleasant experience. We both share a similar mission and it would really mean a lot to me, to be able to help in some way.</div>

</div></div>","Sounds Great, but What the Heck is Fungo Golf?

For those of you sitting their wondering what in the world is Fungo Golf? Pay close attention, I'm going to give you a crash course in Fungo 101:

Basically Fungo Golf is a mix up of both golf and baseball. It's played with the same structure as Golf, except this game is played on a baseball field, with a Fungo bat, and a baseball. Just like when you play golf, the object is to hit your ball into a hole with as few swings as possible. Well, in Fungo golf it's the same idea, but instead of hitting your ball with a club into a hole you have to hit your ball off of certain targets on the field with a fungo bat. Many baseball players who've had to sit through rain delays or has had time between double headers know exactly what Fungo golf is all about. 

Lets say hole #1 would be a sign on the outfield fence. The way you Tee off in this game is a little different than in traditional golf. In Fungo golf you have your bat in one hand, ball in the other and all you do is simply toss the ball up to yourself and swing away. Now from that point as long as you are close enough to the target, in this case the sign on the outfield fence. You have to ""Putt"" your ball just like in golf and try to hit your target. 

 Score is kept the same way as you would keep it in golf. So every time you swing and hit your ball its considered a stroke, and at the end of the game the player with the least amount of strokes wins the game. There are many different variations of how people play it, but this is how we do it!



 Check Out What We've Added Since The Launch!

IS THAT A TORNADO!??








POOR LITTLE BIRDIE






My Story
 I am a recent graduate of William Paterson University in New Jersey, where I received a degree in Business management. I was also a four year starting pitcher for the Pioneers and an all-conference ""Fungo Golfer"". 
It was a little over a year ago, I had baseball practice on a Saturday morning. I got down to the field about an hour early, then a few minutes later, a few of my teammates showed up. I'm sitting there in the dugout and a few of the guys grabbed their fungos, and one by one started to tee off. As i'm sitting their watching them play, it hit me! I thought to myself this would be an awesome game to play against your friends right from your phone. 
So I put pencil to paper and started sketching out what was in my head. As I tweaked the design concept of what I had in my mind, I was also going around campus networking, trying to find someone to join my one man team. Every day I would go to the computer labs, the computer science department, the student center, and the arcade. I met some really cool people, but everyone that I spoke to didn't have the time to help with their work and school schedule, didn't have the skills, or just told me to ""get lost, they were busy"". 
That didn't stop me though, playing baseball my entire life I'm not one to give up on anything!!! Plan B - was to try to find someone to invest in this idea and have it designed, and developed professionally.  I first reached out to my college pitching coach Scott Farber. I figured if anybody would see what I was seeing it would be this guy. He was an All American ball player in college, and although we didn't always see eye to eye on the field, we both had an amazing respect for each other off the field.
It took me about 5 months to actually get to meet with him in person. This was after the season had ended, and every time I reached out to him he was always in the middle of something, or on vacation, but he did seem interested in hearing what I wanted to tell him. So I continued to develop my story boards in more detail, and continued to call him once a week. 
One morning I gave him a call, and he goes ""James meet me in my office at 10:30"". Without hesitation, I got in my car and drove out to meet him. He too dabbled in some Fungo Golf back in his day, so he knew exactly what I was talking about. He loved the idea, and agreed to help fund the development costs to take this from an idea into a product on the market. The next day I reached out to my development team and we started to build the game. I can not begin to thank him enough for believing not only in my idea but believing in me as well. Farbs once again you are the man!


Why come to Indiegogo?


Like I said before, I am a business guy, that's what I went to school for. Although I have a very creative mind, drawing and programming really aren't my strong suit. As of right now all of the work that has been done has been made ""work-for-hire"" and contracted out professionally. 

As you scroll down you will see hiring a designer and programmer to come up with the designs of new fields, characters, and actually taking that artwork and bringing it to life does not come cheap. And all of the start up funds I had, have all dried up. Which is why we need your help to continue development and really take this game to the next level!

OK Fair Enough, Lets Get Down to Business. Where's the money going?







Let me break it down into more detail so you know exactly where every dollar will be spent



$20,000 for IOS Development cost                                                                                 This includes development costs on both the Iphone and Ipad


$7,500 for new fields (Cost to design and program into the game)                         My goal is to get at least 5 new fields  ($1,500 per new field)                           $1,500 x 5 = $7,500


$7,500 for new characters (Cost to design and program into the game)            My goal is to get at least 10 new characters ($750 per new character)            $750 x 10 = $7,500



$4,000 for new power ups and new all new gear for player customization           (This means new hats, shirts, pants, hair styles, shoes, and new weapons)


$1,500 Chat Room in between innings where users can interact and see one another



$7,500 for our initial marketing and promotion


$2,000 for Indigogo's 4% processing fee




What if we exceed our goal, where is that money going to go?

Any additional funds we receive will be used to create more fields, characters, power ups, and design some awesome new gear the players can wear.
Some thing else I would like to do is donate 10% of all money raised after meeting our goal to an organization called Child's Play. Child's Play is a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games through a network of over 70 hospitals worldwide. 

Child's Play works in two ways - with the help of the hospital staff, they set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. With the help of donations they also purchase new  consoles, peripherals, and games for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow children to interact with their peers, friends, and family, and  provide an awesome distraction from an otherwise unpleasant experience. We both share a similar mission and it would really mean a lot to me, to be able to help in some way.



Here are all of the rewards we are offering - Be part of the game
Make sure your getting THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!!!      




You will get a virtual High Five from me

<p>During this 3-day event, Eclectic Endeavors strives to show that the arts found in nerdy interest are just a legitimate as the arts found in mainstream society.  Painting, drawing, sculpting, writing, making movies, crafting props &amp; costumes, digital artwork are all fine art pursuits that more and more are becoming recognized by the public as true art.  Shows on TV like “Face Off”, “Heroes of Cosplay” as well as launching platforms like San Diego ComicCon where major movies and TV shows are premiered and promoted – these show that geeky interest are becoming more public, mainstream and legitimate.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Support G.A.M.E.?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Without your support our events do not happen.  These activities like Picnic At The End of The Universe, Ozarks Adventure Quest, GAME Day at The Creamery and most importantly G.A.M.E. all require financial and volunteer support to take place.  We strive to make good memories for you with these events, and we cannot do that unless we have money to pay for stuff.</p>
<p>With the 4 events that we conduct, we seek to promote nerdy pride in Springfield and the surrounding communities.   We think that our community needs more events like ours.  In our eyes geek art is FINE art and we want to show that off.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>How Does G.A.M.E. Raise Funds?</h3> <p></p>
<p>The group behind G.A.M.E. and our other events is known as Eclectic Endeavors.  This group is a dedicated set of men &amp; women that meet frequently throughout the year.  This group goes out into the community and seeks out sponsorships from local business and philanthropist that want to help back our events.   We also conduct fund-raisers throughout the year.  The majority of our funds for events comes from individual attendees and the registration fees paid to attend G.A.M.E.</p>
<p>Each year our operating budget is $8,000 to $9,000 depending on what activities we’ve planned.  This money comes from sponsorships, fees for tables (artist, clubs &amp; orbs), vendor booths and individual registrations.</p>
<p>A chunk of this budget (for 2014 it will be about $5,000) has to be generated BEFORE the event.  This means before the doors open on G.A.M.E. in October 2014, we have to raise over $5,000 in the form of sponsorships and registrations.  Our fund-raising efforts have to be supported by everyone wanting to see Year 6 happen.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Where Does the Money Go?</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Eclectic Endeavors is a non-profit organization.  We are under the umbrella of the 501(3)(c) provided by the Springfield Regional Arts Council (SRAC).  All of our funding goes directly to paying for the expenses of the events we conduct.  None of the Eclectic Endeavors board members benefits financially from their participation in the organization.   It would be nice someday to have such a huge event that we could pay someone to work on it all year long, or at least compensate some of our folks for their time, but to date it is all volunteers, good-of-their-hear, for fun.</p>
<p>In years past for us to meet these expenses, we’ve often found ourselves putting our own money into the account until we get past G.A.M.E. in October and hope that once we pay the bills, we can pay back loans made by our generous board members.</p>
<p>For Year 6, 2014, our goal is to raise funds BEFORE they HAVE TO be paid and we can avoid making loans from our board’s personal finances.</p>
<p>In an average year our major expense are roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>$300 for Picnic At The End of The Universe</li>
<li>$100 for GAME Day at The Creamery</li>
<li>Over $3000 for the Expo Center Rental</li>

<p>We are a very small company with 40 very happy customers.  As it goes in the hosting business you need to make sure you have good hardware and fast connections,  but that comes at a cost.   To be able to do that I want to build out a server rack for ThunderPig's first colocation project.</p>
<p>This will involve renting rack space in a datacenter in Toronto, Canada. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Then purchasing the hardware to fill that rack.   This rack will be the home of your perks after the build out is complete.</span></p>
<p>Now for a little bit about myself as I am sure you are wonder who will be building this all out.</p>
<p>I am a System and Network Administrator with over 7 years experience in the IT field living in Toronto, Canada.   I have actually been playing with computers since I was 4 years old when I first learned DOS on my own. I really do love to do this stuff :) I work all day on computer issues, and then to wind down my day, I come home and play in my computer lab.  </p>
<p>I have always dreamed of having my own company and my own rack in a datacenter,  it is like the ultimate nerd dream and I am hoping you can help make it possible with me.</p>

<p>Needs to communicate, work, learn, entertain
through computers and multimedia tools highlights the growing need for a faster,
immediate and easy interaction. Input devices with input video systems such as
mouse, joystick or remote controls currently on the market detect a series of
constraints that limit the user's actions and therefore do not provide a simple,
fast and effective interaction. The continuous use of the mouse may also, for
the obliged position to use on a surface, can cause the onset of <b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">DISEASES SUCH AS TENDONITIS HAND OR CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME THE EFFECTS </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">of which incur musculoskeletal

DIFFICULT THE USE OF VIDEO SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS TO PEOPLE WITH MOTOR TEMPORARY
AND PERMANENT DISABILITIES.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In this conditions, in fact, the need to
interact with the multimedia tools is amplified but current systems sometimes make
impossible to use completely computers or software, partially fulfilling some
functions. Scanner emulators or ocular pointing devices, for example, are slow

<p><b>GRAZIE AL MOUSE NABALL</b>, progettato
con l’intento di semplificare l’accesso e l’interazione con i sistemi
informatici a tutte le utenze, persone normodotate, anziani, bambini e persone
affette da disabilità motorie temporanee e permanenti, <b><b>SARÀ POSSIBILE</b>:</b></p>
<p><b>PERMETTERE </b>alle

<p>Esigenze quali
comunicare, lavorare, informarsi, intrattenersi attraverso i computer e gli
strumenti multimediali evidenziano il crescente bisogno di un’interazione
veloce, immediata e facile. I dispositivi di immissione input con i sistemi
video quali mouse, joystick o telecomandi attualmente in commercio rilevano una
serie di vincoli che limitano le azioni dell’utente e di conseguenza non
soddisfano i bisogni di un’interazione semplice, veloce ed efficace. L’utilizzo
continuativo dei mouse inoltre, per la costrizione della posizione d’impiego su
una superficie, <b>provoca </b>l’insorgere di <b>PATOLOGIE QUALI TENDINITE ALLA MANO O LA SINDROME DEL TUNNEL CARPALE  </b>i cui effetti
incorrono in disturbi muscolo‐scheletrici. Bisogna evidenziare inoltre che <b>LE CARATTERISTICHE FORMALI E FUNZIONALI DEI MOUSE IN
USO LIMITANO L’UTILIZZO DEI SISTEMI VIDEO E DEL
COMPUTER DA PARTE DI PERSONE AFFETTE DA DISABILITÀ
MOTORIE TEMPORANEE E PERMANENTI.</b><b></b>.
Nel caso specifico, difatti, l’esigenza di interagire con gli strumenti
multimediali si amplifica e i sistemi d’ausilio in uso rendono talvolta
impossibile un utilizzo completo dei computer e di tutti i software in
commercio poiché soddisfano parzialmente alcune funzioni; gli emulatori a
scansione o i dispositivi a puntamento oculare, ad esempio, oltre ad essere
lenti e imprecisi, devono necessariamente essere abbinati con i mouse per
consentire la complessità di tutte le funzioni richieste e spesso accade che le
persone con disabilità non siano in grado di coordinare i movimenti in modo
sufficiente per azionare tali pulsanti. </p><p><br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">QUALI SONO LE FUNZIONI DEL MOUSE NABALL? </b><br/></p>
<p><b>AUTOINSTALLAZIONE</b></p>
<p>il mouse Naball
consente di avviare e/o riavviare le comunicazioni tra il mouse e il computer
automaticamente, senza alcuna procedura di installazione, senza alcun
posizionamento convenzionale e indipendentemente dall’orientazione assunta
rispetto allo schermo.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>PRIMA E UNICA SUPERFICIE TOUCH CURVA</b></p><p>il mouse Naball è
rivestito da una superficie sensibile al tocco del tipo capacitivo collegata al
nucleo elettronico. Questo consente l’immissione dei comandi di input sulla
superficie attraverso lievi sfioramenti senza la necessita di applicare una
forza di pressione, agevolando e semplificando, in tal senso, i movimenti
articolari. Grazie all’uniformità e omogeneità della superficie esterna è
possibile, inoltre, immettere input su qualsiasi punto della superficie esterna
del dispositivo di puntamento di forma sferica.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>FLESSIBILITA' DI UTILIZZO</b></p>
<p>è possibile impugnare e
utilizzare il mouse Naball indipendentemente dalla disposizione verticale
oppure orizzontale dello schermo. Questo consente di utilizzare il nuovo mouse
sia da persone in grado di svolgere normalmente i movimenti standard, sia da
persone con diversi livelli di disabilità motoria agli arti superiori fino a
persone prive di arti superiori (nello specifico le mani).</p>
<p>Pertanto l’uso può
avvenire nelle seguenti modalità:</p>
<p>- tenendo il
dispositivo nel palmo della mano e imprimendo movimenti di rotazione e
traslazione nello spazio;</p>
<p>- poggiando il
dispositivo su di una qualsiasi superficie e imprimendo movimenti di rotazione

<p>Per la ricarica come
per l’uso, il dispositivo può essere poggiato sulla base in qualunque
posizione. La ricarica avviene per induzione e quindi non richiede alcun
connettore elettrico tra la base ed il dispositivo. </p>
<p>Pertanto:</p>
<p>- non è richiesto un
posizionamento predeterminato né per la carica né per l’uso del dispositivo
sulla base di ricarica </p>
<p>- non ci sono
connessioni elettriche connettori elettrici tra il mouse e la base né
connettori sul dispositivo che interrompano la continuità e l’uniformità della
superficie, così pure è evitata qualunque situazione di rischio dovuta a
liquidi versati sul dispositivo e sulla base.</p>
<p>La ricarica si attiva
automaticamente al posizionamento del mouse sulla base e si interrompe
automaticamente a ricarica completata. La ricarica avviene anche durante l’uso,
seppure può richiedere tempi più lunghi sia per il simultaneo uso di energia
sia per le variazioni di posizione rispetto alla posizione ottimale di
ricarica.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/243398/files/20131205014443-Immagine1.jpg?1386236683"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ACCESSORIO BRACCIALE A MEMORIA DI FORMA </b><br/></p>
<p>Il mouse è costituito
da un accessorio a bracciale a memoria di forma corredato da un display
interattivo e un sistema di ancoraggio. </p>
<p>La struttura del bracciale
consente di adattarsi a qualsiasi tipologia di arto grazie al materiale a
memoria di forma e prevede l’utilizzo da parte di persone prive delle mani o
affette da paralisi totali o parziali delle mani.</p>
<p>Infatti il bracciale,
una volta collocato il mouse nel sistema di ancoraggio, viene fissato al
polso/avambraccio dell’utilizzatore “privo delle mani” mediante un avvolgimento
elicoidale programmato opportunamente rispetto alle diverse esigenze.</p>
<p>Questo consente di
effettuare movimenti di rotazione traslazione della sfera sul piano e di
interagire con il computer senza l’ausilio delle mani.</p>
<p>Il bracciale presenta

IT IS THE FIRST AND
ONLY MOUSE CONCEIVED AND DESIGNED TO ENABLEPEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES to
interact with every video systems. It is the result of the joint effort
of professors and researchers in industrial design, physics, materials
engineering and a student of design, suffering from physical disabilities,  who worked on the audit of the mouse.
[People with disabilities interact
with the environment around theirself through a series of actions carried out
in ways not always understood or effective. Its task is to make this
interaction easier and more effective, if necessary, through an activity of
translation of expression or functional codes. In the current cultural and
technological evolution there is an increasing interest in assistive
technology. Rather than help, we can talk about aid system, in other words a
set of hardware and software interacting with the user and the environment
around.]
NABALL ISMUCH MORE THAN A SIMPLE MOUSE, DUE TO FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY, is able to interact with all video
systems, integrating IN A SINGLE SYSTEM the functions of all the devices on the market
and in use.
This REVOLUTIONARY MOUSE can be used both by people unable to perform
normally standard movements, both by people with different levels of physical
disabilities in the upper limbs, and finally, by people without upper limbs
using the accessory bracelet.
WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING?
The raising need to COMUNICATE, INFORM AND ENTERTAIN are making more and more important the role of interaction by media in the contemporary society. EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO ASK, RECEIVE AND GIVE INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATE IDEAS THROUGH ANY MEDIA AND WITHOUT LIMITS OR BORDERS.The fundraising campaign will be used to finance the
activities of study, research and development of systems, products and services
able TO ENABLE AND CONNECTEVERYONE TO THE CULTURE OF INFORMATION, ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA
ASSISTANCE, ranging from able-bodied to the elderly people, from
kids to people with temporary and permanent disabilities or without limbs.
The fundraiser will be used to
transform into reality needs and desires of people. Having
numerous grants it will be possible to build and develop the first working
prototype of the mouse Naball. To
achieve this first goal
$32,000 are needed. By supporting this project in every possible way,
disseminating information between contacts friends and relatives will be possible
to speed up the construction and implementation of the new mouse for everything and everyone.
BECOME A BUILDER OF DREAMS ........!!!WHAT ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF NABALL?With Naball, designed with the
intent to simplify the access and interaction with computer systems to all
users, people without disabilities, the elderly, children and people with
temporary and permanent disabilities, it will be possible to:
ALLOW people with disabilities and
without upper limb - hand - to interact completely with all video systems and
software on the market;
PREVENT the onset of diseases derived from the
continuing use of the mouse;
MINIMIZE the effort and the necessary
movements to work on the computer, change channels on TV and play;
SIMPLIFY the procedures for interaction with
all multimedia systems to communicate, work and entertain;
SPEED UP the
interaction with all multimedia systems;
USE in a
customized way, in the space and on any type of surface systems of interaction;
SIMPLIFY the
interaction with game consoles to children under the age of 10 years;
ENABLE elderly
people to use video systems while minimizing operations.WHICH MEETS THE NEEDS NABALL MOUSE?
Needs to communicate, work, learn, entertain
through computers and multimedia tools highlights the growing need for a faster,
immediate and easy interaction. Input devices with input video systems such as
mouse, joystick or remote controls currently on the market detect a series of
constraints that limit the user's actions and therefore do not provide a simple,
fast and effective interaction. The continuous use of the mouse may also, for
the obliged position to use on a surface, can cause the onset of DISEASES SUCH AS TENDONITIS HAND OR CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME THE EFFECTS of which incur musculoskeletal
disorders. Moreover, must be emphasized that THE CURRENT FORMAL AND
FUNCTIONAL FEATURES OF DEVICES MAKE
DIFFICULT THE USE OF VIDEO SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS TO PEOPLE WITH MOTOR TEMPORARY
AND PERMANENT DISABILITIES.In this conditions, in fact, the need to
interact with the multimedia tools is amplified but current systems sometimes make
impossible to use completely computers or software, partially fulfilling some
functions. Scanner emulators or ocular pointing devices, for example, are slow
and imprecise and need to be combined with a mouse to allow all the functions
required. Often people with disabilities are not able to coordinate the
movements in a way sufficient to operate these buttons.WHAT ABOUT THE FEATURES OF NABALL?AUTOMATIC FUNCTIONWith the mouse Naball you can connect with ease, disconnect and reconnect to the computer without performing any additional steps, there is not a conventional position or an association between its direction and screen.  FIRST AND UNIQUE TOUCH SURFACE CURVEThe mouse Naball
is covered with a touch-sensitive, capacitive type surface connected to the
electronic core. For this reason you can enter input through slight touches of
its surface, without applying a pressure on it. As a result it simplifies the joint
movements. Due to the uniformity and homogeneity of the external surface is
also possible to enter an input in any point of the external surface of the spherical
shape device.FLEXIBILITY IN USEYou can hold and use the mouse Naball regardless of the vertical or
horizontal position of the screen. 
It can be used both by people unable to perform
normally standard movements, both by people with different levels of physical
disabilities in the upper limbs, and finally, by people without upper limbs
(specifically the hands).
Therefore, it can be used in the following
ways:
- Holding the device into the palm of your hand
and moving it, rotating and translating it into the space;
- Putting the device on any surface and moving
the ball, rotating and translating it, on a plan;
- Using the device on the charging base and
rotating it;
- Anchoring the device to the shape memory cuff,
putting it on a surface and moving, rotating and translating it, on the plan.

THE MAGIC OF TOUCHES WITH THE FIRST SPHERICAL TOUCH MOUSE NABALLRAPID ROTATIONAL
ACCELERATIONThis command allows you to enter an input
through the fast-moving acceleration towards right or to the left.
CLICKThis command allows the user to enter an input
through a single click on any point of the external surface of the sphere,
without any conventional button or holding the mouse into the palm of your hand
and rotating it in space, holding the mouse on the worktable or any surface, or
anchoring it to the mouse accessory cuff.DOUBLE CLICK
This command allows the user to open the file
by double clicking on any point on the external surface of the sphere, without
any conventional button,  holding the
mouse into the palm of your hand and rotating it in space,  holding the mouse on the worktable or any
surface, or anchoring the mouse to the accessory cuff.SCROLL 
This command allows the user to scroll the
window on the desktop PC and / or on the TV screen through the linear touch on
any point of the external surface of the mouse.CHARGING THE MOUSETo recharge, as well as to use it, the device
can be put on the base in any position. The charging takes place by induction,
and therefore does not require any electrical connector between base and
device.
For these reasons the mouse Naball:
- Does not require a predetermined position,
neither for the charging or use of the device into the charging cradle.
- There are no electrical connections between
the mouse and the base that can interrupt the continuity and uniformity of the
surface, in this way is avoided any risk situation due to spilled liquids on
the device and on the base.SHAPE MEMORY ACCESSORY CUFF, ADAPTABLE AND FLEXIBLEThe mouse has a shape memory accessory bracelet
equipped with an interactive display and an anchoring system.
Due to its shape-memory material, the structure
of the bracelet is adaptable to any type of limb, even to people without hands
or suffering from total or partial paralysis of the hands.
After you put the mouse in the anchoring
system, is possible to put the cuff at the wrist/forearm of the user without
hands just through a helical winding programmed for different needs. It enables
users to make offsets and rotation of the ball on a plan and interact with the
computer without the use of hands.
The cuff has an interactive display to interact
with the mouse and with the computer through the touch of the surface or
entering voice commands. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTIONvideo made by designer Elvira Passerobrand made by phd arch. Giuseppe VaccaroTEAM WORKING GROUPDICDEA

È il primo e unico mouse pensato per TUTTO e per TUTTI
Brevetto di Invenzione Industriale numero_
NA2011A000031 
Estensione PCT numero_PCT/IT2012/000217
NABALL È IL PRIMO E UNICO MOUSE PENSATO E PROGETTATO
PER CONSENTIRE AI DIVERSAMENTE ABILI di
interagire con tutti i sistemi video. È il risultato di un lavoro
congiunto di docenti e ricercatori dell’area del disegno industriale, docenti e
ricercatori di fisica e ricercatori in ingegneria dei materiali e un allievo
designer, affetto da disabilità motoria, che ha collaborato alla verifica del
mouse.
[La persona con disabilità si rapporta con l’ambiente
circostante mediante una serie di azioni svolte attraverso modalità non sempre
comprensibili o efficaci. Il compito dell’ausilio è quello di facilitare questo
rapporto e l’efficacia delle azioni, se necessario, attraverso una vera e
propria opera di traduzione di codici espressivi o funzionali. Nell’attuale
situazione di evoluzione tecnologica e culturale, si registra un fortissimo
incremento dell’interesse verso gli ausili tecnologici. Più che di ausilio si
può parlare di sistema di ausilio, da intendere come un complesso insieme di
hardware e software che interagiscono con la persona e l’ambiente circostante.]
NABALL È MOLTO PIÙ DI UN SEMPLICE MOUSE,
GRAZIE ALLA MASSIMA FLESSIBILITÀ E ADATTABILITÀ, è in
grado di
interagire con tutti i sistemi video, integrando in un sistema unico le funzioni di tutte le periferiche in
commercio e in utilizzo. Il rivoluzionario mouse può
essere utilizzato sia da persone in grado di svolgere normalmente i movimenti
standard, sia da persone con diversi livelli di disabilità motoria agli arti
superiori fino a persone prive di arti superiori con l’accessorio a bracciale.PERCHE' ABBIAMO BISOGNO DI FONDI ? 
Il crescente bisogno di COMUNICARE, INFORMARSI, e INTRATTENERSI rendono sempre più rilevante e
nevralgico il ruolo della interazione mediatica nella società contemporanea. CIASCUNO HA IL DIRITTO DI CHIEDERE, RICEVERE E COMUNICARE INFORMAZIONI E
IDEE ATTRAVERSO QUALSIASI MEZZO E SENZA LIMITI NÉ FRONTIERE.
La campagna raccolta fondi servirà per finanziare l’attività
di studio, ricerca e sviluppo di sistemi, prodotti e servizi in grado di
ABILITARE E CONNETTERE TUTTI VERSO LA CULTURA DELL’INFORMAZIONE,
DELL’INTRATTENIMENTO E DELL’ASSISTENZA MEDIATICA, dalle
persone normodotate agli anziani; dai bambini alle persone con disabilità
motorie temporanee e permanenti fino a persone privi di arti. 
La raccolta fondi servirà per trasformare in realtà i bisogni e i desideri delle persone, grazie ai numerosi
contributi sarà possibile COSTRUIRE E SVILUPPARE IL PRIMO MODELLO FUNZIONANTE DEL MOUSE
NABALL. Per ottenere
questo primo traguardo sono
necessari $ 32,000. Sostenendo questo progetto in tutti i modi possibili,
diffondendo le informazioni tra i contatti, amici e parenti, sarà possibile
accellerare la costruzione e realizzazione del NUOVO MOUSE PER TUTTO E PER TUTTI. 
DIVENTA ANCHE TU UN COSTRUTTORE DI SOGNI……..!!!
QUALI SONO I VANTAGGI DEL MOUSE NABALL? 
GRAZIE AL MOUSE NABALL, progettato
con l’intento di semplificare l’accesso e l’interazione con i sistemi
informatici a tutte le utenze, persone normodotate, anziani, bambini e persone
affette da disabilità motorie temporanee e permanenti, SARÀ POSSIBILE:
PERMETTERE alle
persone con disabilità motorie e prive di arti superiori – mano – di interagire
con tutti i sistemi multimediali e software in commercio in maniera completa;
EVITARE l’insorgere di dolori e
infiammazioni;
RIDURRE al minimo lo
sforzo e i movimenti necessari per lavorare al pc, cambiare i canali in tv e
giocare; 
SEMPLIFICARE le modalità
d’interazione con tutti i sistemi multimediali per comunicare, lavorare e
intrattenersi; 
VELOCIZZARE l’interazione con
tutti i sistemi multimediali;
UTILIZZARE in maniera
personalizzata, nello spazio e su qualsiasi tipologia di superficie i sistemi
d’interazione;
PERMETTERE alle persone
anziane di utilizzare i sistemi multimediali riducendo al minimo le operazioni;
FACILITARE l’interazione con le console game ai bambini con
un’età inferiore ai 10 anni.QUALI ESIGENZE SODDISFA IL MOUSE NABALL? 
Esigenze quali
comunicare, lavorare, informarsi, intrattenersi attraverso i computer e gli
strumenti multimediali evidenziano il crescente bisogno di un’interazione
veloce, immediata e facile. I dispositivi di immissione input con i sistemi
video quali mouse, joystick o telecomandi attualmente in commercio rilevano una
serie di vincoli che limitano le azioni dell’utente e di conseguenza non
soddisfano i bisogni di un’interazione semplice, veloce ed efficace. L’utilizzo
continuativo dei mouse inoltre, per la costrizione della posizione d’impiego su
una superficie, provoca l’insorgere di PATOLOGIE QUALI TENDINITE ALLA MANO O LA SINDROME DEL TUNNEL CARPALE  i cui effetti
incorrono in disturbi muscolo‐scheletrici. Bisogna evidenziare inoltre che LE CARATTERISTICHE FORMALI E FUNZIONALI DEI MOUSE IN
USO LIMITANO L’UTILIZZO DEI SISTEMI VIDEO E DEL
COMPUTER DA PARTE DI PERSONE AFFETTE DA DISABILITÀ
MOTORIE TEMPORANEE E PERMANENTI..
Nel caso specifico, difatti, l’esigenza di interagire con gli strumenti
multimediali si amplifica e i sistemi d’ausilio in uso rendono talvolta
impossibile un utilizzo completo dei computer e di tutti i software in
commercio poiché soddisfano parzialmente alcune funzioni; gli emulatori a
scansione o i dispositivi a puntamento oculare, ad esempio, oltre ad essere
lenti e imprecisi, devono necessariamente essere abbinati con i mouse per
consentire la complessità di tutte le funzioni richieste e spesso accade che le
persone con disabilità non siano in grado di coordinare i movimenti in modo
sufficiente per azionare tali pulsanti. QUALI SONO LE FUNZIONI DEL MOUSE NABALL? 
AUTOINSTALLAZIONE
il mouse Naball
consente di avviare e/o riavviare le comunicazioni tra il mouse e il computer
automaticamente, senza alcuna procedura di installazione, senza alcun
posizionamento convenzionale e indipendentemente dall’orientazione assunta
rispetto allo schermo.






PRIMA E UNICA SUPERFICIE TOUCH CURVAil mouse Naball è
rivestito da una superficie sensibile al tocco del tipo capacitivo collegata al
nucleo elettronico. Questo consente l’immissione dei comandi di input sulla
superficie attraverso lievi sfioramenti senza la necessita di applicare una
forza di pressione, agevolando e semplificando, in tal senso, i movimenti
articolari. Grazie all’uniformità e omogeneità della superficie esterna è
possibile, inoltre, immettere input su qualsiasi punto della superficie esterna
del dispositivo di puntamento di forma sferica.
FLESSIBILITA' DI UTILIZZO
è possibile impugnare e
utilizzare il mouse Naball indipendentemente dalla disposizione verticale
oppure orizzontale dello schermo. Questo consente di utilizzare il nuovo mouse
sia da persone in grado di svolgere normalmente i movimenti standard, sia da
persone con diversi livelli di disabilità motoria agli arti superiori fino a
persone prive di arti superiori (nello specifico le mani).
Pertanto l’uso può
avvenire nelle seguenti modalità:
- tenendo il
dispositivo nel palmo della mano e imprimendo movimenti di rotazione e
traslazione nello spazio;
- poggiando il
dispositivo su di una qualsiasi superficie e imprimendo movimenti di rotazione
traslazione della sfera sul piano;
- utilizzando il dispositivo
sulla base di ricarica e imprimendo movimenti di rotazione;
- ancorando il
dispositivo al bracciale a memoria di forma poggiandolo su qualsiasi superficie
e imprimendo movimenti di rotazione traslazione della sfera sul piano.LA MAGIA DEI TOCCHI CON IL PRIMO MOUSE SFERICO TOUCH NABALL 
RAPIDA ACCELLERAZIONE ROTAZIONALEquesto comando consente di immettere un input attraverso il movimento rapido di accelerazione verso destra o verso sinistraCLIC
questo comando consente
di immettere un input attraverso un singolo clic su qualsiasi punto della
superficie esterna della sfera, senza alcun tasto convenzionale, sia tenendo il
mouse nel palmo della mano e ruotandolo nello spazio, sia tenendo il mouse sul
piano di lavoro o su qualsiasi superficie e sia ancorando il mouse
all’accessorio bracciale.DOPPIO CLIC
questo comando consente
di aprire i file attraverso un doppio clic su qualsiasi punto della superficie
esterna della sfera, senza alcun tasto convenzionale, sia tenendo il mouse nel
palmo della mano e ruotandolo nello spazio, sia tenendo il mouse sul piano di
lavoro o su qualsiasi superficie e sia ancorando il mouse all’accessorio
bracciale.SCROLL
questo comando consente
di scorrere la finestra sul desktop del pc e/o sullo schermo del televisore attraverso
lo sfioramento lineare su qualsiasi punto della superficie esterna del mouse.RICARICA DEL MOUSE
Per la ricarica come
per l’uso, il dispositivo può essere poggiato sulla base in qualunque
posizione. La ricarica avviene per induzione e quindi non richiede alcun
connettore elettrico tra la base ed il dispositivo. 
Pertanto:
- non è richiesto un
posizionamento predeterminato né per la carica né per l’uso del dispositivo
sulla base di ricarica 
- non ci sono
connessioni elettriche connettori elettrici tra il mouse e la base né
connettori sul dispositivo che interrompano la continuità e l’uniformità della
superficie, così pure è evitata qualunque situazione di rischio dovuta a
liquidi versati sul dispositivo e sulla base.
La ricarica si attiva
automaticamente al posizionamento del mouse sulla base e si interrompe
automaticamente a ricarica completata. La ricarica avviene anche durante l’uso,
seppure può richiedere tempi più lunghi sia per il simultaneo uso di energia
sia per le variazioni di posizione rispetto alla posizione ottimale di
ricarica.ACCESSORIO BRACCIALE A MEMORIA DI FORMA 
Il mouse è costituito
da un accessorio a bracciale a memoria di forma corredato da un display
interattivo e un sistema di ancoraggio. 
La struttura del bracciale
consente di adattarsi a qualsiasi tipologia di arto grazie al materiale a
memoria di forma e prevede l’utilizzo da parte di persone prive delle mani o
affette da paralisi totali o parziali delle mani.
Infatti il bracciale,
una volta collocato il mouse nel sistema di ancoraggio, viene fissato al
polso/avambraccio dell’utilizzatore “privo delle mani” mediante un avvolgimento
elicoidale programmato opportunamente rispetto alle diverse esigenze.
Questo consente di
effettuare movimenti di rotazione traslazione della sfera sul piano e di
interagire con il computer senza l’ausilio delle mani.
Il bracciale presenta
un display interattivo che consente di interagire con il mouse e con il
computer attraverso lo sfioramento della superficie touch o l’immissione di
comandi vocali.GRAZIE PER L'ATTENZIONE.....!TEAM DI LAVORO

<div><br/></div>
<p data-select-like-a-boss=""1""><b>2) Crafting</b>
– Crafting is an important part of “<b>Sunken</b>”. More than anything, you will be
looting crafting materials. Crafting is done exclusively in the ‘crafting room’
found on every level of the dungeon. To be able to craft anything,
though, <b>you will need to find recipes for the items or the abilities that you want to
craft</b> (yes, the abilities are not gained through leveling, but by crafting!).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3) Randomization</b> – Although the levels aren't randomized (the
reason for this will be written below), the <b>monsters and the loot are random</b>. Whether
you’ll get a weak sword or a great armor, whether you’ll run into a few zombies
or an elite Impaler with Tormentors following in his wake, is left to chance, the chance you
will have to take in “<b>Sunken</b>”.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441741331/e7ikxcdsjw2aojl6nguk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p data-select-like-a-boss=""1""><b>4) Leveling </b>– Soooo, where is the real RPG element in all
this, right? By leveling, you gain stats. They are <b>Might</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>, <b>Vitality</b>
and <b>Intellect</b>. With each level gained, you have five stat points to distribute
as you see fit. Even when you find the
best-in-slot gear, the game is not over, you keep leveling and fighting. Just
be sure to use the distribution to follow your style, as you cannot get back
the points you have invested. As the death is permanent, invest these points
well!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<div><br/></div>
<p><b>5) Atmosphere</b>
– Sure, we like games that are simply
fun, but the immersion through visuals, sounds and storyline is irreplaceable for
us. Thus, “<b>Sunken</b>” will try to be heavy on immersion. This is also the reason
why the levels aren't randomized – they look too generic, at least
with the very limited assets available to us. This is also one of the reasons
(the other one being permadeath) why “<b>Sunken</b>” isn't as fast-paced as some other
games of its genre, thus there are no stats like “attack speed” or “movement
speed”.<b> Stomping the content as quickly as possible isn't the goal – survival is</b>. “<b>Sunken</b>” is set in an eerie dungeon out of this world and we want that atmosphere to sink into your bones.<br/></p>

<div><br/></div>
<br/>
<p><b>6) Narrative</b>
– We like story-driven games. Although “<b>Sunken</b>” is an ARPG, we have tailored
the narrative to our liking, and we tried not to allow the action to overshadow
the story. There are many lore books lying around in each level of the dungeon,
and we hope they will be a treat for the people who love having a good story in
their games. <b>The narrative is not spoon-fed, and you will have to figure out
some things on your own</b>. Of course, for those not interested, skipping any
narrative piece is always an option.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>7) Competition</b> – You will fight –
until you die. <b>Compete with other players by checking the leaderboard</b>.
Whoever reaches the farthest ‘spin’ and ‘level’ (hey, we do not have to reveal
everything, right?), is leading the boards. Go get them, tigers. You don't want to compete with other players? No worries, completing single player campaign will give you just as much satisfaction. You make the decision.</p>

guys giving their souls into making “Sunken” – a game, hopefully, worthy your
time and attention.






An atmospheric, dungeon crawling ARPG
with a touch of a Roguelike,
“Sunken” is
intended to be a marriage of genres with several aspects listed (and explained)
below.



1) Permadeath – Since the beginning of the project, we wanted
“Sunken” to be hardcore. When you die, you lose your levels and equipment,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Angelos Kyprianos. I am a full time musician and songwriter. The only thing that has managed to distract me from my music, is my love for pen &amp; paper role-playing games. I have been working on this game since i was 11 years old. 20 years later, i am about to set it free! It has been a long journey of endless work, fun and creativity. People who have grown up with these types of games, know how i feel, for others, i would recommend that you make some time and room for this in your life, it's going to blow your mind.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here is the deal: WE NEED:</p>
<ul>
<li>Such a game to be developed requires a lot. Artwork mainly, and lots of it, and good. We need the funds to cover the expenses of the amazing illustrator we are working with.</li>
<li>Printing of the books and production. Digital is fine, but printed books are always the best option for these types of games.</li>
<li>Miniatures and combat grid. It's a long shot, but maybe, we can pull off 3d printing of unique miniatures, dice, and terrains, basic stuff to start off a campaign!</li>
<li>Songs! Yes, a singer-songwriter can be turned into a bard if needed! I am trying to record a few game related bard style songs to give along with the game, contributing to the fantasy vibes.</li>
<li>IN RETURN YOU GET:</li>
<li>A lot of perks, assigned below, of course, game related.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why this game specifically?</p>
<ul>
<li>The detailed character generation system and combat gameplay is both detailed and fun. It includes all these small features we always wanted our pen &amp; paper game to have. It allows strategy, different combat maneuvers, spells and skills. Choice of weapons does matter, their range, their damage, the way they are used can change everything!</li>
<li>The stories. So much lore. So many years of creation and campaigning. This is not a bubblegum pre-made game of basic origin stories. It has been created through endless campaigns, inspired stories, hours &amp; hours of gaming and writing. They have depth, and characters with depth, and they blend in a great campaign setting of a fascinating world.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are so many difficulties to overcome. The creation of the artwork fo the whole project. We are talking weapons, creatures, races, maps, symbols, armors etc. We are talking about endless hours of beta testing, changes, tweaks and all sorts of trouble down the road.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no going back, It took me 20 years to make this game, it's coming out no matter what!</li>
<li>We'll proceed to finalizing this game regarding all areas for every month that passes through intense work and creative thought. All issues are being addressed and solved one way or another. The whole project is almost complete, to a stage that builds hype and excitement because we can actually see the end of this road!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You know it folks, share share share, and talk, and explain, and ask!</p>
<ul>
<li>We Fantasy Gamers and generally gamers are in love with this stuff. We are commited and we know the good it has done to our lives, growing up with games like these.</li>
<li>Please take a moment and tell a friend if you can't help financially. Or help by beta testing, or help with the creation of promo tools, videos, audio, anything that comes to mind. </li>
