<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px; font-weight: normal;"">Corelli [and band] project</span></p>
<p>Hi there, friends!</p>
<p>I'm Catherine Corelli, a singer/songwriter, composer, arranger, guitarist, lyricist, actress, painter from Moscow, Russia, half-Italian, quarter-Polish, quarter-Russian. I've been making music for a long time, actually most of my life, but the first instrumental album I made was finished in 2003. I started publishing my self-produced albums for free on Jamendo.com [<a href=""http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/360816/catherine-corelli"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/360816/catherine-corelli</a>] in 2010. All these years I've been looking for a band, for soul-mates, for someone with whom I could form a real project, the one I would be able to bring to live shows to Europe, Canada, USA, England etc.</p>
<p>And at last it happened! Right now I got the entire crew, a band that is able to perform a brilliant record and also bring the album to live shows with all the passion, masterpiece and expression possible directly to where you live.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>CORELLI</b> band is:</p>
<p><b>Alex Alexandrov</b> - drums, percussions<br/><b>Alfred Norton</b> - bass, techs<br/><b>Alan Matthews</b> - keyboards, trumpet<br/><b>Cat Corelli</b> - vocals, guitar<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What do we have for you?</span></h3>
<p>For the last two months I'm working on a re-make of my old 2010 album 'Through The Gehenna' [<a href=""http://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a73014/through-the-gehenna"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a73014/through-the-gehenna</a>]. The re-make already has it's first single, 'Snow' that is published and available for free streaming and downloading here: <a href=""http://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a125476/snow-outta-gehenna-single"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As you may get it from a simple compare, the re-make [Outta Gehenna] is not only a re-record, a re-arrangement, but in a huge part a whole one big re-concept, a new experience, and the new shape and sound of the album rather tends to alternative/rock/sky-fi/rapping. Contrary to the 2010 version these old songs have a more solid, rocking and up-tempo beat. And the sweetest part of it all is the live performance. Back in 2010 I had no drummer, no bass-player, no guitarist, and I was just making the whole thing on my PC in Reason 4.0, but times change. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have a nice studio in Kiev, Ukraine and all the necessary stuff there to do a real, rich, rocky hell of a sound for you, guys. I've been to that studio with another project and was really impressed with it's quality together with the exclusive charisma of it's owner. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I'll upload a video on YouTube about our record session there with L Angels so that you could see what's up! </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is the Outta Gehenna track-list, that will include a couple of re-makes from the Reborn Heart album [<a href=""http://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a116153/reborn-heart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a116153/reborn-heart</a>]</p>

<p>Actually we need 6.000$ to record this 12-track album and also handle the trip to Kiev from Moscow.

<p><br/></p>
<p>And do you know what are we fighting for here? Our music is a stand-up against the so-called fake-plastic-soulless-crap culture, against the dead-born modern mass-media.

<p>After the album is recorded and mixed we'll publish it on CDBaby.com and also order CD manufacturing so that you'd be able to get a hard firm disk in your hands with all the creative art-work and inside-bonuses!</p>

<h3>Disheveled Tour 2013, with no tires.</h3>
<p>It is time for us to venture out across the country to bring you high energy, emotional live shows.

We are left with old tires that will not get us across the country (some 1600 miles). </p>
<p>Every contribution that is made goes directly to getting these for our vehicle. Anything over will go to our tour fund. Let's face it, in this day - touring is pretty expensive and quite the challenge. We are stoping at nothing to overcome this and bring you the shows that you want to see! </p>

<p>Vincent
Bélanger
studied at the Québec
Conservatory and moved on to the Montpellier National
Conservatory in France where he graduated with the highest honors. He furthered
his studies two additional years with renowned French cellist,
Yvan Chiffoleau. Followed by a master class with Yo-Yo Ma.<br/></p>
<p><b>Professional Experience</b></p>
<p>Vincent particularly enjoys playing rare and unique works. Some were
composed for him, as in the case of a Chinese work with which he toured Canada
for the month-long Chinese New Year Celebration shows. In 2011, he was the
featured cellist in an extensive tour of China and Vietnam. He is also credited
with several original scores for theater and film, the latest being the
critically acclaimed <i>“</i><i>Ce
qu’il ne faut pas dire</i><i>”, </i>released
in Montreal in May 2015.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
<span>His album <i>“</i><i>L</i><i>À</i><i>”,</i>released in Spring 2011 on Fidelio,
received unanimous critical and public praise both in North America and

<p><b>The Current Project</b></p>
<p>His first solo album of rare and never-before-recorded music for solo cello
reflects perfectly Vincent’s desire to
reach out to a large public. He hopes to simultaneously touch everyone with
the sheer beauty of the music while impressing them with the very high level of
virtuosity it requires.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Your Support Matters</b></p>
<p>Supporting Vincent’s unique
project makes you a
participant in a state-of-the-art musical product giving you a new and exciting
listening experience. You will be the <i><b>First to listen to a First</b></i>. In today’s global recording world, supporting such an innovative professional
project also means you believe in supporting the very finest talents.</p>
<p><b>What W</b><b>e
</b><b>Need to Complete the Project</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442087512/wqeozpwc7hddmg981bjx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<b></b><p></p>
<p>The works have been recorded in an historical church near Boston which
boasts perfect acoustics. The project’s total cost is evaluated at $30,000. We need a
minimum of <b>$10,000</b> from supporters to see it through. The balance will be
financed<span>  by special events we will
be </span><span>holding.</span></p>
<p>The funds we
garner will serve to pay for a new bow, better suited for the repertoire,
recording costs – equipment, rental of facility - technical team,
artwork for the manufacturing of the cd, vinyl and their promotion.</p>
<p>
<span>This project is unique in its musical content, the excellence of the interpretation<span>  and the use of the most sophisticated
recording techniques and  the best
recording engineers working to produce the very best sound.  In short, we are aiming for a listening
experience that will blow you out
of your seat</span> ! </span></p>
<p>In such a
competitive, crowded recording world, THE ONLY way to stand out is by
originality and excellence and this is what we ask you to support.</p>

The Ultimate Listening Experience !
    Studies
Vincent
Bélanger
studied at the Québec
Conservatory and moved on to the Montpellier National
Conservatory in France where he graduated with the highest honors. He furthered
his studies two additional years with renowned French cellist,
Yvan Chiffoleau. Followed by a master class with Yo-Yo Ma.
Professional Experience
Vincent particularly enjoys playing rare and unique works. Some were
composed for him, as in the case of a Chinese work with which he toured Canada
for the month-long Chinese New Year Celebration shows. In 2011, he was the
featured cellist in an extensive tour of China and Vietnam. He is also credited
with several original scores for theater and film, the latest being the
critically acclaimed “Ce
qu’il ne faut pas dire”, released
in Montreal in May 2015.





His album “LÀ”,released in Spring 2011 on Fidelio,
received unanimous critical and public praise both in North America and
overseas, including China. It was ranked a best seller for several week on the
US site HDTracks.com.
https://vincentbelanger.bandcamp.com 




The Current Project
His first solo album of rare and never-before-recorded music for solo cello
reflects perfectly Vincent’s desire to
reach out to a large public. He hopes to simultaneously touch everyone with
the sheer beauty of the music while impressing them with the very high level of
virtuosity it requires.




Why Your Support Matters
Supporting Vincent’s unique
project makes you a
participant in a state-of-the-art musical product giving you a new and exciting
listening experience. You will be the First to listen to a First. In today’s global recording world, supporting such an innovative professional
project also means you believe in supporting the very finest talents.
What We
Need to Complete the Project



The works have been recorded in an historical church near Boston which
boasts perfect acoustics. The project’s total cost is evaluated at $30,000. We need a
minimum of $10,000 from supporters to see it through. The balance will be
financed  by special events we will
be holding.
The funds we
garner will serve to pay for a new bow, better suited for the repertoire,
recording costs – equipment, rental of facility - technical team,
artwork for the manufacturing of the cd, vinyl and their promotion.

This project is unique in its musical content, the excellence of the interpretation  and the use of the most sophisticated
recording techniques and  the best
recording engineers working to produce the very best sound.  In short, we are aiming for a listening
experience that will blow you out
of your seat ! 
In such a
competitive, crowded recording world, THE ONLY way to stand out is by
originality and excellence and this is what we ask you to support.

What they have to say:

Peter Qvortrup, Audio Note UK

""It pleases me greatly to have the opportunity to support a fine musician such as yourself in your efforts to communicate the beauty, hope, power an passion of music to your audience. 
Thus, it is with great pleasure that I have fully sponsor your new bow. I look forwarde to hearing your newest recording, Bélanger - Pure Cello to hear the result!""


Scott Hull, Part Time Audiophile

""That was the best thing I heard, hands down and game over. Of course, that was live. Hardly fair. That said, a nod is due — it was a marvelous demo.


After hearing Bélanger play, I was done. Show was over. I went home and cried like a lost little baby (well, no, not quite, but I was teary for an hour, which is almost the same thing)."" September 2015



Jeremy Bryan, MBL North America

""MBL North America has worked with Vincent Belanger on several occasions. He is a musician of the highest order; one whose love for his instrument is only superseded by his love for music. This virtuosity oozes from Vincent's very pores. You feel this whether you are experiencing his playing live or recorded.""
Keith Pray,  publisher of Stereophile Magazine 


""Playing the Cello with Vincent was an experience that I will never forget... The connection between instrument and Vincent was captivating and the sound produced was intoxicating.""
Robert Deutsch, Stereophile Magazine

<h2>Who are you, and why do you want my money?</h2>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""><b>Here's a quick summary:</b> i'm caleb mueller, a Canadian artist and musician, and i've been releasing music as Decomposure since 2002. In summer 2010, i embarked on a project creatively titled 'the podcast project', wherein i wrote and recorded a completely new song every week (or at least tried to) and posted it up as a podcast online. Now i'm over here in fall 2011, sitting on a stack of songs that i'm pretty pleased with, and i'd love to polish my favourites into a digestible album and release them into the great wide ocean out there.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"">But beyond that, i'm at the point right now where it isn't good enough to just put it up on iTunes, or have a pressing plant spit out a few shrinkwrapped plastic things. As a graphic artist by day, i send booklets and posters and brochures to printers all the time, and they handle it all perfectly, filling box after box with sharp, precise, color-matched copies. But i don't want that for my music. i don't want to stand off to the side while other people carry out my orders, i want to be <i>in</i> it, putting my imperfect self into each scrappy copy. Maybe i'm just in denial or deluded, but if i'm going to approach this album as a serious checkpoint, i want it to be handmade, tactile, personal, unique. And i want that DIY experience to be available to everyone, not just people who can afford the deluxe edition.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"">So, i have some big ideas for this album, and in order to make them work, i need your help.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"">First and foremost, your money will go directly toward paying down the album's engineering, pressing and packaging costs. That's the basic amount i need to fully develop the album as i envision it - if i reach that, i'll be ecstatic. Here's a rough estimate of the cost breakdown:<br/><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>$500.00 -</i> Engineering and post-production<br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>$500.00 - </i>Pressing the physical CDs<br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>$1500.00 - </i>Materials for building the album art and packaging<br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>$3000.00 - </i>Promotion<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"">You'll notice that last number is bigger than the first three combined, and has nothing to do with the album itself. (Most labels spend a lot more.) This is one of those unavoidable realities about music, one i honestly hate thinking about. But for the vast overwhelming majority of us musicians, the 'viral hit' fairy doesn't swoop down and save us - the interweb is dense with forgotten albums played once for single-digit audiences. Practically speaking, in order to be heard, someone with smarts and connections and tenacity needs to get on the phone and tell people over and over and over that i exist and that i'm worth listening to. Some people are good at this. i'm not. Demonstrably so. i suck at it, frankly.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"">So, the inclusion of this (pretty minimal) amount of promotion is just me dreaming a little bigger, setting a good ambitious goal - having a finished album is great, but it'd also be nice if people, you know, wanted it. Sure, it's just icing, but then, not many people like cake without icing. Chances are, you heard about me through some radio station or reviewer (or a friend who heard it from them, etc.), and you would have missed out on this album if it weren't for that. Helping me tackle this means that you'll be one of those special seed-people responsible for a harvesting a brand new crop of Decomposure fans. And that would be pretty cool, right? Right?</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""><br/></p>

<h2>What do i get for being awesome?</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"">Details are a still a little sketchy at the moment, as some things are reliant on funding - i'll update as things progress. So, depending on your level of support, you can get:<br/><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0px;""></p>

<li>
<b>Your name</b> in the album's 'thank you' credits and listed on the Blank Squirrel website.<br/>

</li>
<li>

Here's a quick summary: i'm caleb mueller, a Canadian artist and musician, and i've been releasing music as Decomposure since 2002.

$500.00 - Engineering and post-production


$500.00 - Pressing the physical CDs


$1500.00 - Materials for building the album art and packaging


$3000.00 - Promotion




You'll notice that last number is bigger than the first three combined, and has nothing to do with the album itself. (Most labels spend a lot more.) This is one of those unavoidable realities about music, one i honestly hate thinking about. But for the vast overwhelming majority of us musicians, the 'viral hit' fairy doesn't swoop down and save us - the interweb is dense with forgotten albums played once for single-digit audiences. Practically speaking, in order to be heard, someone with smarts and connections and tenacity needs to get on the phone and tell people over and over and over that i exist and that i'm worth listening to. Some people are good at this. i'm not. Demonstrably so. i suck at it, frankly.


So, the inclusion of this (pretty minimal) amount of promotion is just me dreaming a little bigger, setting a good ambitious goal - having a finished album is great, but it'd also be nice if people, you know, wanted it. Sure, it's just icing, but then, not many people like cake without icing. Chances are, you heard about me through some radio station or reviewer (or a friend who heard it from them, etc.), and you would have missed out on this album if it weren't for that. Helping me tackle this means that you'll be one of those special seed-people responsible for a harvesting a brand new crop of Decomposure fans. And that would be pretty cool, right? Right?


What do i get for being awesome?
Details are a still a little sketchy at the moment, as some things are reliant on funding - i'll update as things progress. So, depending on your level of support, you can get:



Your name in the album's 'thank you' credits and listed on the Blank Squirrel website.


The album - As yet untitled (though i'm really really close to picking one), it will be 50-60 minutes of finely engineered music packaged in colorful handmade album art, complete with lyrics of course.


Digital copy - There's always a large gap between the date the album is engineered and the date it's actually released, but you'll get a secret link that lets you access a digital copy much sooner.


'Complete' CD full of extra songs - Containing the remaining songs from the Podcast Project that didn't make it to the album for reasons of time and flow.


'Special Features' bonus disc - A DVD-ROM loaded up with even more bonus stuff, including videos, sound sources, images, instrumentals and acappellas, all the original podcasts, and more!


Decomposure T-Shirt - Available exclusively to people who donate here. They'll be limited-run screenprints on shirts made in either Canada or the US.


Decomposure's discography - Everything Decomposure has ever released on one snappy little USB drive or memory stick, including bonus stuff!


A lyric book - Again, completely exclusive. Made and bound by hand, containing the words to every song Decomposure's released up 'til now. Limited quantities available.


One totally exclusive song - Donors who hit this level will get access to a completely new song that i will never release outside of this offer.


'Producer' credit - in a giant font.





Above all that, you'll be investing in me - i can't tell you how wonderful it is to have the music i create actively supported by people. Most of the time, i am quite sure i'm all alone in this, dropping another stillborn into the vast silent pit of time. i'm getting better at being okay with that, but i'd be lying if i said i didn't well up with joy whenever i'm proven wrong, even slightly.

So prove me wrong, please! Thank you in advance.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><a href=""http://www.fmworldcharities.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FM World Charities""><strong>FM World Charities</strong></a>, a registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization devoted to promoting public health and improving the quality of life in underserved communities throughout the world, is seeking to raise the remaining $15,000 of a $50,000 initiative so it can provide its legendary free skin cancer screening and awareness at this year's <a href=""http://gatheringofthevibes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival""><strong>Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival </strong></a>in July 2013. FM has already <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39526954/ns/us_news-giving/t/rock-n-roll-charity-touts-skin-cancer-screenings/#.UaVC15VGhUM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""NBC News"">broken records worldwide</a> for mobile skin cancer screenings in North America and Europe, successfully screening over 10,000 concert attendees, in which over 1,500 needed follow-up. Help us continue to save lives in this much needed healthcare concern.</p>
<p>At FM we believe that part of providing adequate healthcare is to help screen for common illnesses <em>before</em> they become life threatening. One concept that we developed is to provide skin cancer screening sessions and awareness during concerts and other public events. Since FM is a music-based charity, having roots in an established record label, it is uniquely able to reach the youth demographic, mainly 16-25 year olds, who attend music concerts and festivals. This group is important to reach because they are at increasingly greater risk of skin cancer. In 2008 FM went on the <a href=""http://www.vanswarpedtour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Van's Warped Tour"">Vans Warped Tour</a>, the nation's longest running concert festival touring series, and conducted the largest mobile screening ever in 46 cities throughout the U.S. and Canada, screening over 6,500 concert attendees, in which over 700 needed follow-up. FM handed out 10,000 UV protective products and skin cancer awareness literature.</p>
<p><img alt=""Eric screening"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/w5bae5zbh/101005_Eric_Gast_4p_grid_6x2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Eric screening""/></p>
<p>Following up on that success, FM has since provided these screenings at the 2009 <a href=""http://www.surfexpo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Surf Expo"">Surf Expo</a>, conducted a cancer awareness initiative and seminar at the 2009 <a href=""http://www.bostonmusicconference.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Boston Music Conference"">Boston Music Conference</a>, performed screenings at the 2010 <a href=""http://www.ucmusicfest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UC Music Fest"">UC MusicFest</a> (Clark, NJ), and screened over 2200 concert attendees in France on the FM/NRJ/FDJ Music Tour in the summer of 2010. FM also ran successful screenings at the legendary <a href=""http://gatheringofthevibes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""GOV"">Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival</a> in 2011 and 2012.  </p>
<h3><strong>World Skin Cancer</strong></h3>
<p>In the US in 2008 alone, 59,695 people were diagnosed with melanoma, and 8,623 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Skin cancer - wiki"">people died from it</a>. In some parts of the world, such as Australia, people are four times more likely to develop skin cancer than any other form of cancer. <a href=""http://www.actcancer.org/sun-smart/skin-cancer.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Skin cancer Australia"">Approximately 2 out of 3 Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer before the age of 70</a>. Melanoma has also become <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/112073.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""melanoma women"">the most common cancer in women between the ages of 25 and 29</a>. However, if detected early, the survival rate for patients with skin cancer is about 99%.</p>
<p>FM’s screenings at music concerts and festivals are crucial in that they not only increase the number of individuals being screened for these conditions but, given the age of the people usually attending these events, <a href=""http://missmelanoma.blogspot.com/search/label/FM%20World%20Charities"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Miss Melanoma"">they introduce the idea of preventative health care to a young audience</a>. For example, the incidence of skin cancers is increasing rapidly throughout the world. A small lesion that develops when a person is 20 years of age will often be ignored for years before it becomes symptomatic and life threatening. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to avoiding these problems.</p>
<p>According to Eric Gast, CEO of FM World Charities, “The Warped Tour not only gave us an increase in the number of individuals being screened for these conditions, but given the age demographic of this US country wide and Canada tour, it introduced the idea of preventative health care to a young audience. Our hope is to increase awareness and provide rudimentary screenings particularly to this young age group, who seldom are concerned with health issues. This program is somewhat revolutionary for a charity to be administering an initiative across a tour of this magnitude.” </p>
<h3><strong>How We Do It</strong></h3>
<p>The portable screening stations that FM uses in its mobile screenings utilize SIAscopy technology. SIAscopy makes use of the way light interacts with skin – the way it scatters or bounces and the amount absorbed by cells and other structures. These small handheld machines are becoming popular to evaluate questionable lesions and will make it easier to screen larger numbers of people. Photographs of the lesions are taken and later re-evaluated. If there is anything suspicious about the lesion, the patient will be contacted by mail or phone and directed to the appropriate medical facility for confirming diagnosis and follow up treatment.</p>

<h3><strong>The Gathering of the Vibes</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://gatheringofthevibes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""GOVibes"">Gathering of the Vibes</a> (GOTV) is one of the world's longest running music festivals going. <span>GOTV is an annual four-day music, camping and arts festival that </span><span>showcases a very diverse variety of music. In both 2011 and 2012 FM brought cancer awareness and </span>ran successful screenings reaching thousands of festival attendees.</p>
<p>Help FM this year make a real difference in our public's health and awareness. If you or a loved one have been affected by cancer, we urge you to help us prevent and bring awareness to one of the most preventable cancers around the world.

<h3><strong>Other FM Initiatives:  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Legacy of Hope: the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Concerts</strong></h3>
<p>In 2012, FM World Charities embarked on its ""<a href=""http://legacyofhopeconcerts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""LOH website""><strong>Legacy of Hope</strong></a>"" initiative: an international multimedia concert in partnership with the <strong>Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Trust</strong> (<strong>NMCH</strong>), in cooperation with <strong>Operation of Hope</strong>. Through this partnership, FM World Charities will produce a multi-media concert featuring major artists performing on two continents simultaneously. The goal of this event is to raise awareness and funds towards the establishment of the <strong>Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital</strong> in Johannesburg, South Africa. Unique and revolutionary to this event will be the delivery of a documentary, broken down into short vignettes, interspersed between artists' performances. This documentary will celebrate the life and living legacy of <strong>Nelson Mandela </strong>. This year long ""Legacy of Hope"" initiative will be an educational push through music, culminating in this momentous simulcast concert.</p>
<p><strong>Nelson Mandela </strong>said ""<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fm-world-charities-embarks-on-groundbreaking-documentary-about-the-healing-power-of-music-150927335.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Nelson Mandela"">A dedicated children's hospital will be a credible demonstration of the commitment of African leaders to place the rights of children at the forefront. Nothing less would be enough.</a>""</p>

<h2><strong>Our Goal:  </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>FM needs to reach its goal of $15k towards its free skin cancer screenings at the Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival in July 2013. Funds will go towards such expenses as the SIAscopy equipment, cameras and laptops, food and lodging, printing for educational materials, medical scrubs, branded materials and give-aways (e.g., sunscreen) and production costs. Additional funds will also go towards all FM initiatives. </p>
<p>For your kind support, FM is offering these wonderful benefits (more to be added):</p>

<p><strong><img alt=""FM Bus"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/pc1qqetql/pomona_sunset.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""FM Bus""/> </strong></p></div>","Help us raise $15,000 towards FM World Charities initiatives.
FM World Charities, a registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization devoted to promoting public health and improving the quality of life in underserved communities throughout the world, is seeking to raise the remaining $15,000 of a $50,000 initiative so it can provide its legendary free skin cancer screening and awareness at this year's Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival in July 2013. FM has already broken records worldwide for mobile skin cancer screenings in North America and Europe, successfully screening over 10,000 concert attendees, in which over 1,500 needed follow-up. Help us continue to save lives in this much needed healthcare concern.
At FM we believe that part of providing adequate healthcare is to help screen for common illnesses before they become life threatening. One concept that we developed is to provide skin cancer screening sessions and awareness during concerts and other public events. Since FM is a music-based charity, having roots in an established record label, it is uniquely able to reach the youth demographic, mainly 16-25 year olds, who attend music concerts and festivals. This group is important to reach because they are at increasingly greater risk of skin cancer. In 2008 FM went on the Vans Warped Tour, the nation's longest running concert festival touring series, and conducted the largest mobile screening ever in 46 cities throughout the U.S. and Canada, screening over 6,500 concert attendees, in which over 700 needed follow-up. FM handed out 10,000 UV protective products and skin cancer awareness literature.

Following up on that success, FM has since provided these screenings at the 2009 Surf Expo, conducted a cancer awareness initiative and seminar at the 2009 Boston Music Conference, performed screenings at the 2010 UC MusicFest (Clark, NJ), and screened over 2200 concert attendees in France on the FM/NRJ/FDJ Music Tour in the summer of 2010. FM also ran successful screenings at the legendary Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival in 2011 and 2012.  
World Skin Cancer
In the US in 2008 alone, 59,695 people were diagnosed with melanoma, and 8,623 people died from it. In some parts of the world, such as Australia, people are four times more likely to develop skin cancer than any other form of cancer. Approximately 2 out of 3 Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer before the age of 70. Melanoma has also become the most common cancer in women between the ages of 25 and 29. However, if detected early, the survival rate for patients with skin cancer is about 99%.
FM’s screenings at music concerts and festivals are crucial in that they not only increase the number of individuals being screened for these conditions but, given the age of the people usually attending these events, they introduce the idea of preventative health care to a young audience. For example, the incidence of skin cancers is increasing rapidly throughout the world. A small lesion that develops when a person is 20 years of age will often be ignored for years before it becomes symptomatic and life threatening. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to avoiding these problems.
According to Eric Gast, CEO of FM World Charities, “The Warped Tour not only gave us an increase in the number of individuals being screened for these conditions, but given the age demographic of this US country wide and Canada tour, it introduced the idea of preventative health care to a young audience. Our hope is to increase awareness and provide rudimentary screenings particularly to this young age group, who seldom are concerned with health issues. This program is somewhat revolutionary for a charity to be administering an initiative across a tour of this magnitude.” 
How We Do It
The portable screening stations that FM uses in its mobile screenings utilize SIAscopy technology. SIAscopy makes use of the way light interacts with skin – the way it scatters or bounces and the amount absorbed by cells and other structures. These small handheld machines are becoming popular to evaluate questionable lesions and will make it easier to screen larger numbers of people. Photographs of the lesions are taken and later re-evaluated. If there is anything suspicious about the lesion, the patient will be contacted by mail or phone and directed to the appropriate medical facility for confirming diagnosis and follow up treatment.

The Gathering of the Vibes
The Gathering of the Vibes (GOTV) is one of the world's longest running music festivals going. GOTV is an annual four-day music, camping and arts festival that showcases a very diverse variety of music. In both 2011 and 2012 FM brought cancer awareness and ran successful screenings reaching thousands of festival attendees.
Help FM this year make a real difference in our public's health and awareness. If you or a loved one have been affected by cancer, we urge you to help us prevent and bring awareness to one of the most preventable cancers around the world. Check out below what we need and what we can offer to you.

Other FM Initiatives:  
Legacy of Hope: the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Concerts
In 2012, FM World Charities embarked on its ""Legacy of Hope"" initiative: an international multimedia concert in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Trust (NMCH), in cooperation with Operation of Hope. Through this partnership, FM World Charities will produce a multi-media concert featuring major artists performing on two continents simultaneously. The goal of this event is to raise awareness and funds towards the establishment of the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. Unique and revolutionary to this event will be the delivery of a documentary, broken down into short vignettes, interspersed between artists' performances. This documentary will celebrate the life and living legacy of Nelson Mandela . This year long ""Legacy of Hope"" initiative will be an educational push through music, culminating in this momentous simulcast concert.
Nelson Mandela said ""A dedicated children's hospital will be a credible demonstration of the commitment of African leaders to place the rights of children at the forefront. Nothing less would be enough.""
 
Our Goal:  
What We Need & What You Get
FM needs to reach its goal of $15k towards its free skin cancer screenings at the Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival in July 2013. Funds will go towards such expenses as the SIAscopy equipment, cameras and laptops, food and lodging, printing for educational materials, medical scrubs, branded materials and give-aways (e.g., sunscreen) and production costs. Additional funds will also go towards all FM initiatives.

It is now time to put our big NHC plan into operation, the NHC MUSIC HUB. </span></h3>
<p>The HUB will run primarily as a book/music cafe in the centre of Glasgow, with the emphasis on nurturing the wealth of talent on the unsigned and independent music scene, both local and national. Not only will the HUB have music from only unsigned and independent bands playing instore from morning til night, there will also be recorded and live shows, including an open mic stage and a couple of pick up and play acoustic guitars lying around for folk to play. We will also sell merchandise, music and tickets for musicians... and here is the clinker, we will do it absolutely free of charge. That's right, every penny we make from a band's own albums, singles, tickets and merchandise goes right back to them to help fund what they do best, making music.</p>
<p>We at NHC MUSIC believe a place like this can not only be an excellent meeting place for bands and musicians, but can also be hugely beneficial to the local music scene and beyond. We want to take music back from the big labels and money men and turn it into a bustling local scene to be proud of and one where bands and artists can make their own money while getting the promotion and help they need to bring their music to a wider audience. We want people to pop in for a coffee and a root through the books and music covering the walls and hopefully they will hear something new to love! You can help make this awesome place happen and with contributions starting at only 3 bucks you can help us out without breaking the bank. Every penny we can get really will make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we need and what you get:</p>
<p>We need a minimum of £600 to get the shop kitted out once we move in. This will buy us a lot of the simple, yet necessary things that we need to open the doors to the public. Things such as paint, a small stage, a till, chairs and tables etc. We have a lot of things already purchased and donated including a book and vinyl stock of our own (over 3000 items so far and growing weekly) as well as cups, t-spoons, glasses, amps, and microphones for the stage, but there is still a long way to go. We have a great selection of perks for musicians and bands (and also us normal folk!) to get you involved and give you something back for your donation, so please take a look at the side bar and see what we are offering, from specially printed mugs of your band to be used instore (for that extra promotional mug) to free coffee for a year and even full promotional photoshoots!</p>
<p>If we get over the target then we will just add more things to the shop for musicians to use, such as small amps and breakables that they can borrow for gigs free of charge, or we will go wild and get a bigger premises with a bigger stage so that we can squeeze more music and bands in! There is always more that we can do and as we always have done at NHC MUSIC, we promise that every penny of profit we get from the HUB (including coffee and book sales of our own) goes right back into the local music scene. We truly do believe that what we are planting the seeds for just now, will revolutionise the independent music scene forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More about the campaign:</p>
<p>We believe that bands have it hard enough without having to pay out more and more money every day and we don't want to add to that ever building budget! Our plan was always simple from the start, help bands to help themselves by making things easier for them. Give them a place that sells their stuff (without paying for the privilege) and plays their music, gives away their badges and flyers and puts on 'fair for all' non pay to play gigs for them. A place where they can go and chill out with a coffee or tea with other local musicians and possibly do some networking, with an open mic and a stage that they can practice on at select times together with with guitars sitting around wanting to be played. There will also be gig listings, and listings for local, excellently priced recording studios, van hire businesses that won't rip you off, venues and promoters that play fair and everything else they may need help with in store for them to look through. The NHC MUSIC HUB is that very place. It's not just an idea, it's the start of a better way of doing things!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other ways to help:</p>
<p>We know that a lot of folk are skint these days, that is one of the reasons that we are opening the HUB, but if you don't have any cash to give then please just share our idea and this campaign around to family and friends. People talking about what we are starting here in Glasgow helps us just as much as cash does, promotion is a necessity and there's no better publicity than people power and word of mouth, so if you know of a band or musician that this could benefit, from anywhere in the world, then please do tell them to visit the page here and on Facebook. Every little helps, even if that help is word of mouth!</p></span></div>","The NHC MUSIC team has been working hard this past year and a half, supporting and promoting unsigned and independent bands and musicians both online and off.

I am hoping to raise $20,000 to help with my immediate costs associated with marketing, advertising, and printing of books and CDs. I am also eager to record a series of songs that are yet to be professionally produced. 
 
Please consider making a contribution to help make a positive difference for the children in your community.
 
If you cannot contribute financially, please help spread the word about my bullying prevention initiative, by connecting with Nelson the Giant on Facebook and joining me in my effort to THUMP! Out Bullying.
 
A GIANT and sincere thanks for your support!

My youngest brother, Rasool, was in a motor vehicle accident at the age of five, leaving him brain-damaged and partially paralyzed. He cannot pursue an education or a career. He is now twenty-three years old. I am extremely grateful and blessed to have my brother in my life. As an individual with special needs, Rasool is subject to bullying. On March 22, 2011, I created a YouTube video called ""Stop Bullying Now"" in which I addressed and silenced Rasool's bullies. However, what started off as a bullying project took a different turn. I looked at life differently and promised to live every moment of it trying to make my brother happy. So, on Saturday, July 23, 2011, I created a Facebook group page called ""Help a Disabled Fan Meet Justin Bieber."" Rasool's biggest dream in his life is to meet Justin Bieber, and as his sister, I will do everything I possibly can to fulfill his dream. So far, there are 9,000 group members who are supporting Rasool's campaign. </p>
<p>Rasool's group page has gained media attention, being published in City TV, <em>The Daily Metro</em>, <em>Burnaby NewsLeader</em>, and <em>Asian Journal</em>. </p>
<p>Furthermore, my love for my brother has given me the strength to publish my first book, titled, <em>Jeegareh Ma</em>, an autobiographical novel based on my family's journey to Canada from Afghanistan and on Rasool's life story. The book is published by The Key Publishing House Inc. and can be purchased on Amazon.</p>
<p>As his sister, I have been doing everything in my power to help my brother. I have contacted Justin's management team. I have been writing to Ellen Degeneres and Scooter Braun everyday for the past year. I have created petitions, contacted disability organizations, and wish foundations. I even took Rasool to the Warner Brother's studio in the hopes of gaining Ellen Degeneres's attention, but sadly, that too failed. There are several YouTube videos regarding this cause (please search ""Help a Disabled Fan Meet Justin Bieber"" on YouTube).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, while I realize that getting Justin Bieber to meet my brother may be an impossible task, creating a community of support is not impossible. Therefore, I have created this campaign in the hopes of taking my brother on his dream vacation because he deserves it. Please share my campaign and help my video, Rasool, go viral.</p>
<p>And, as for getting my brother to meet Beiber, I will continue to fight and one day, Rasool will meet Justin. However, this will only be possible if we spread the message.</p>

<h3>Every day our government and political leaders are writing new laws and destructive regulations that strip away our constitutional rights. They're stripping away the very rights that they have swore an oath to uphold!</h3>

<p>Is it because we believe and buy into their false promises for ""HOPE"" and ""CHANGE""?</p>
<p>Is it because our friends or our family have a history of being for or against 1 of the 2?</p>

<h3>Do the Democratic and Republican leaders have the answers?</h3>
<p>Has their been any real change for the better in your life or America over the past four decades?</p>
<p>Not talking about personal changes and growth! Of course, your life has been changed, however...</p>
<h3>The question you may want to ask yourself is...</h3>
<p>Has the standard/cost of living increased or decreased since America's Recession?</p>
<p>Have the gas priceses gone down? What can you buy with $1 in today's economy?</p>
<h2>What Does Real CHANGE Look and Feel Like in America?</h2>

<p>Everything seems worse now in 2012 than it was before Mr. Obama took term in 2008!</p>
<p>Why isn't this ""change"" with all of the millions of laws, regulations, destructive litigration to so call protect and benefit us Americans actually helping ordinary citizens such as me and you?</p>
<h2>What's really changed in America in the past four years?</h2>
<h3>Why is our Standard of Living going down instead of rising up?</h3>
<p>NO SHIT NO MORE is not speaking out against President Obama, for he may have genuinely wanted things to ""change"", but what has really changed for the better in our American society?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter which side -- Democratic or Republican -- gets your vote because they both have been given the same exact job description, which is to NOT serve the people and instead they're instructed to carry hidden agendas of the leaders who pulled the strings to get them in office.</p>
<h2>Pay attention and WAKE UP!</h2>
<h2>It's the same Political Party!</h2>
<h2>Just different color that's all</h2>
<p>What would it look like if the majority of we the people voted for neither of these two political parties this year and instead we voted for a new party that's entirely different political party in this election?</p>
<p>Would the veil of American politics be drawn if we witness them still choose and select their own candidate regardless of what we the people choose just like they did in 2004 presidential elections?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span lang=""en-US"">Hi there, I'm Kristian Sensini, a film composer from Italy, my full bio is at </span><span style=""color: #000080;""><span lang=""zxx""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a class=""western"" href=""http://www.scorekomposer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.scorekomposer.com</a></span></span></span><span lang=""en-US"">. I've recently composed the soundtrack for the Horror Movie ""Hyde's Secret Nightmare"" by Domiziano Cristopharo and I tought it could be a cool idea to share the production process with people using Indiegogo.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span lang=""en-US"">The campaign is for the release of the Soundtrack on Cd; when you work on a film project, the soundtrack you actually hear in the movie doesn't often see a realease on Cd. The campaign will cover the cd production process (music has been composed and recorded). </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span lang=""en-US"">The film follows the tradition of Italian horror movies and directors like </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Dario Argento</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Lucio Fulci</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">,</span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Mario Bava</span></strong><span lang=""en-US""> and also </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Federico Fellini</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span lang=""en-US"">The music inspiration comes from great composers such as </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Alex North</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Ennio Morricone</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Fabio Frizzi</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">The Goblin</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Claudio Simonetti</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Pino Donaggio</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Bernard Hermann</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">. The soundtrack (more than an hour of music) explores lots of different genres, from classical Orchestra and </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Chamber Music</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, to Minimal and </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Progressive Rock</span></strong><span lang=""en-US""> Music from the seventies. I've tried to stay away from the clichès of modern horror music, looking for a sort of vintage sound.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang=""en-US"">I've also composed the trailer music for the movie. Last year, this trailer received a nomination in the ""Music for Promotion"" category at the International Film Music Awards </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">""Jerry Goldsmith""</span></strong><strong><span lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.</span></span></strong><span lang=""en-US""> Here you can listen to the music from the trailer (this track is included in the Cd)</span></p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span lang=""en-US"">The Movie</span><span lang=""en-US""> “Hyde's Secret Nightmare” is a horror reactionary reinterpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's book “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”. </span><strong><span lang=""en-US"">Domiziano Cristopharo</span></strong><span lang=""en-US"">, an independent director from Rome, was the first Italian director to try and recover the erotic/horror genre almost 4 years ago, gaining an enormous success of audience and critics and 6 international awards. He has always been compared to a perfect mix between Fellini and Dario Argento: his touch has a vintage taste, his style is extreme, shocking and classic at a time.</span></p>

<li>
<p><strong><span lang=""en-US"">""Why can’t you find a Publisher or a Label that could publish the CD?""</span></strong><span lang=""en-US""> That's a good question... I actually work with several labels which can print and publish my works. The point is that when you give your music to a publisher, you usually have to sign an agreement, and at this point the composer isn't really free to use HIS music in the way he wants. For example, if my Music is published for ""XYXWZ record"" and I want to license one of my songs to a film-maker, I can't freely choose to give him the track, and he should ask the publisher for a license (and it could be really expensive). If the fans who buy the cd and want to support the campaign help to cover the expenses, actually WE can be the publisher: this can give me the freedom to make a cd and then make the use I want of my music (even let film-makers use it for FREE... if I decide that way). Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart did something like this... when he stopped serving the court, he became one of the first ""indie"" musicians in history. In 1781 he decided to become a freelancer musician and to do a series of subscription concerts... the public paid him in advance, to write and organize the concerts. Now... I'm not Mozart but the idea is pretty much the same... fans, music lovers and horror movie nerds like me can preorder the cd and contribute in this way to the production of the soundtrack.</span></p>

<p> </p></div>","HELLO !


Hi there, I'm Kristian Sensini, a film composer from Italy, my full bio is at www.scorekomposer.com. I've recently composed the soundtrack for the Horror Movie ""Hyde's Secret Nightmare"" by Domiziano Cristopharo and I tought it could be a cool idea to share the production process with people using Indiegogo.


The campaign is for the release of the Soundtrack on Cd; when you work on a film project, the soundtrack you actually hear in the movie doesn't often see a realease on Cd. The campaign will cover the cd production process (music has been composed and recorded). 


The film follows the tradition of Italian horror movies and directors like Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci,Mario Bava and also Federico Fellini.


The music inspiration comes from great composers such as Alex North, Ennio Morricone, Fabio Frizzi, The Goblin, Claudio Simonetti, Pino Donaggio, Bernard Hermann. The soundtrack (more than an hour of music) explores lots of different genres, from classical Orchestra and Chamber Music, to Minimal and Progressive Rock Music from the seventies. I've tried to stay away from the clichès of modern horror music, looking for a sort of vintage sound.


I've also composed the trailer music for the movie. Last year, this trailer received a nomination in the ""Music for Promotion"" category at the International Film Music Awards ""Jerry Goldsmith"". Here you can listen to the music from the trailer (this track is included in the Cd)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqI9VUNL6w
 


The Movie “Hyde's Secret Nightmare” is a horror reactionary reinterpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's book “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”. Domiziano Cristopharo, an independent director from Rome, was the first Italian director to try and recover the erotic/horror genre almost 4 years ago, gaining an enormous success of audience and critics and 6 international awards. He has always been compared to a perfect mix between Fellini and Dario Argento: his touch has a vintage taste, his style is extreme, shocking and classic at a time.

What We Need & What You Get


What We Need

The soundtrack has been recorded, so what I need is the founding to produce the cd and deliver it to the fans.
Here's the extimated cost:


Cd Mastering done by a professional recording studio (350$)


Cd Cover Graphics and Jewel Case done by a professional artist (200$)


Shipment and Handling to you (about 300$ for 100 copies)


Most important: Cd Print. I will use the service offered by CDBABY http://duplication.cdbaby.com/ (150 CD-Rs w/content & label print, Full Color On-disc Printing, Poly Wrap, Printed Digipak - UV Gloss Coating, UPC Bar Code) 661.80 $


Taxes (yes, making a project like this requires taxes to pay)



What You Get

Basically the Soundtrack on cd but I've added some interesting options.


CD SOUNDTRACK


Mp3 SOUNDTRACK (Download Link)

Here are a couple of ideas for Indipendent Film Directors, Studios, Film Students, Low Budget Movie Projects: if you contribute to the campaign, you will have the following options:


HAVE THE TRACKS ON THE CD LICENSED FOR YOUR PROJECT (several cues are good for Horror Movies (of course...), Thriller and even Drama Ones.


HAVE A PROFESSIONAL COMPOSER (me...) to write the music for your next Short Movie or Feature Film.

So you've several options, depending on your budget.
I thought this is a cool idea to share creativity and to contribute to the Indipendent Movie Market. As you can see the prices are really fair if you think that the average price for a professional licensed track is about 200$, not talking about the price for a full Soundtrack Custom made for you.
 
THE CD : here's the tracklist

Bad Dream
Hyde's Secret Nightmare
Bed of Horrors
Body Language
Vintage Tension
Truth or Dare
Transformation
Sad-Uction 
Death Lover
Bad Memories
Mother
Elektro Dark
Twinge of Love
Love You Madly
Beyond The Mirror
Serial Kill Her
Love Bites
Original Sin
Revelation
End Titles
Bonus Content
Hyde's Secret Nightmare 2nd Trailer
+ two songs from the soundtracks of the Horror Movie P.O.E. : Poetry of Eerie

Other Ways You Can Help
I've added an option for just 1$ donation, it's a fair price for downloading some music samples. If you don't want to spend any money you can still help this campaign... how?

<p class=""p1""><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Poaching of wildlife has increased throughout southern Africa dramatically over the last 4 years. Rhino poaching particularly is on the rise, with poachers using ever more sophisticated methods of hunting - including the use of the veterinary drug, M99. The year 2011 has had the highest level of rhino poaching with more than 400 killed  - that's one every 20 or so hours, with more incidents reported daily. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The National Parks have anti-poaching units, and all are learning on a daily basis as the threat increases and their own lives are put in danger. Each park has its own challenges and requirements as the wildlife and topography change. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There is a lot of importance placed on protecting wildlife from poachers, but very little filters down to the people on the ground actually fighting a war, often in very difficult conditions. </p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">The idea is to create a book of photography on Anti-Poaching Units around South Africa, and possibly other African countries if enough money is raised. Profits from the book will go towards equipment for rangers in an effort to make their lives that little bit easier, and give them the recognition they deserve. While rhino poaching is the biggest threat in the news at the moment, helping rangers will ultimately help all wildlife in these reserves. This book will not only cover rhino poaching but other forms as well. Anti Poaching Units play an essential role whether they're dealing with rhinos, abalone poaching on the coast, eliminating snares which often catch wild dogs and other animals, trafficking of animals such as parrots or those that hunt rare oribi antelope with dogs. </p>

<p class=""p1""><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>Vanessa Stephen</b> is a photographer, writer and ecologist. She has spent years working in the bush and has seen first hand the destruction and devastation that poaching can cause, as well as the extreme determination and passion of the people involved in preventing this. She worked with wildlife documentary makers Earth-Touch for a number of years, providing scientific input, taking numerous stills in many different places and filming for them for documentaries sold to National Geographic and Smithsonian. </p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>

<p class=""p1""><b>David Goldblatt </b>needs little introduction. One of South Africaâ€™s most famous documentary photographers, he is internationally acclaimed for his work. The following is a biography from the Goodman Gallery. ""David Goldblatt has been photographing and documenting South African society for over 50 years. Born in Randfontein in 1930 to parents who came to South Africa to escape the persecution of Lithuanian Jews in 1890, he was simultaneously part of privileged white society and a victim of religious persecution and alienation. Motivated by his contradictory position in South African society, Goldblatt began photographing this society, and in 1963 decided to devote all of this time to photography.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Goldblatt focuses on critical explorations of South African society. While he uses photography as a means of accessing and exploring people and societies, David Goldblatt is acutely aware of the ethics of photography, and has used the camera as a way of capturing the complexities and intricacies of the specific conditions and situations that he photographs. His photographs are neither propaganda nor violently provocative, but rather become far more complex, meditative documents that are open to interpretation and that permeate far more deeply, and for longer than the initial shock and violence associated with documentary and news photography.""</p>

<em>6/4/12 UPDATE:</em> We did it!  Thanks to everyone who contributed.  I can't wait for you guys to hear it.  That said, if you still want to give, you still can!  I can still use extra money for things like better mastering, hiring more musicians, and marketing/promotion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, you should still donate if you want to garauntee that you'll get a copy of the <em>FULL cd</em>.  There will <strong>ONLY BE 50 MADE</strong>, and after those are gone, I'm only going to have cd's in sleeves and downloads.</div>
<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<div>People have been asking me if they can contribute, so I wanted to address that here: <strong>YES!!!!!</strong>  Also, here is the breakdown of what I can/will use the money for so you can see exactly where your support will be going:</div>
<ul>
<li>Paying a professional drummer: $200-$400 (either 1 or 2 songs)</li>
<li>Mastering: $150-300 (depending on who I choose for this)</li>
<li>CD Ducplication: $250-??? (depending on how many CD's I need)</li>
<li>Marketing/Promotion: $100-??? (depending on...)</li>
</ul><div>The last item I will only use if I have money left over after everything else (which would probably mean if I got over $1,000).  Otherwise, I will probably have to spend a bit of my own for that if I decide to do it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now that I've reached the minimum, don't feel like you have to contribute (unless you want to make sure you get a CD).  But if you still want to it is greatly appreciated!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There's nothing quite like buying a new album from your favorite artist, right?</div>

<div>As much as you enjoy the anticipation, and finally, the first listen of their new music, typically you are left in the dark about the entire process until you have the finished product in your hands.  Not anymore!</div>
<div> </div>

<div>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<div>After 10 years of working on getting this done, I'm finally realizing I need help!  I would love to hire a drummer to record some professional drum tracks for me and have someone else do the post production (aka ""mastering"") to make it sound AWESOME.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most importantly, I want your help not just in financial support but in helping me make some decisions!  This can and will include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>song choice/order</li>
<li>CD cover art</li>
<li>and even the tile of the CD itself!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>I would love for you to be involved and that's why I asking for your help.</div>
<p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</p>
<p>Craig Allen</p>
</div></div>","6/4/12 UPDATE: We did it!  Thanks to everyone who contributed.  I can't wait for you guys to hear it.  That said, if you still want to give, you still can!  I can still use extra money for things like better mastering, hiring more musicians, and marketing/promotion.
 
Also, you should still donate if you want to garauntee that you'll get a copy of the FULL cd.  There will ONLY BE 50 MADE, and after those are gone, I'm only going to have cd's in sleeves and downloads.
NOW WHAT?
People have been asking me if they can contribute, so I wanted to address that here: YES!!!!!  Also, here is the breakdown of what I can/will use the money for so you can see exactly where your support will be going:

Paying a professional drummer: $200-$400 (either 1 or 2 songs)
Mastering: $150-300 (depending on who I choose for this)
CD Ducplication: $250-??? (depending on how many CD's I need)
Marketing/Promotion: $100-??? (depending on...)
The last item I will only use if I have money left over after everything else (which would probably mean if I got over $1,000).  Otherwise, I will probably have to spend a bit of my own for that if I decide to do it.
 
Now that I've reached the minimum, don't feel like you have to contribute (unless you want to make sure you get a CD).  But if you still want to it is greatly appreciated!!

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Mind The Art Entertainment is proud to develop an original, exciting and new Japanese Opera in New York City. As a majority of Opera houses close their doors to new work, we embrace growth and innovative voices and continue to fight against the norm that is the rapidly dissapearing Opera world. We believe strongly that an art form must continually grow and evolve and for that, new work must be supported, encouraged and developed. It is with great interest and commitment then that we ask you to help us develop this wonderful work with us.</p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<h3>The Opera</h3>
<p><em>Kiyo</em>, an opera in three Acts based on the Japanese legend of Kiyo-hime, was written by Jan and Kayo Albert with the utmost respect for Japanese historical and cultural heritage.</p>
<p><em>Kiyo </em>presents a story of purity and passion taken to the extreme while realizing the impermanence of all things.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Kiyo</em> begins with a young girl named Kiyo whose painful past follows her to Mrs. Haru's tea house. There she works and meets the young priest Zenshin who lives at Abbott Kukai's temple and is his promising student. In the spring, Kiyo and Zenshin fall hopelessly in love with each other, and Mrs. Haru, for her own reasons, cannot approve.</p>
<p>As time passes through summer and autumn Zenshin begins to question his true calling. He is assured that Buddha’s teaching is what he must follow and his passion for Kiyo grows cold. Kiyo, after losing her entire family and whose future life with Zenshin means everything, cannot accept that and swears revenge. She attains supernatural powers from Kompira, a legendary serpent, by surrendering her own soul. At the opera's climactic scene, taking place during the winter, Kiyo turns herself into a serpent. She chases Zenshin who hides inside the temple bell.  In a moment of passion she climbs the bell and melts it, killing herself and Zenshin.  </p>
<p>Both Japanese and western audiences will appreciate <em>Kiyo’s </em>universal themes. <em>Kiyo</em> includes wonderful Japanese traditional and cultural themes such as the stories of <em>Jizo</em> and <em>Kaguya</em>, <em>O’Bon </em>and<em> Tea Making Ceremony, Stone Garden</em> and<em> Ikebana, Susuki Ballet</em> and<em> Buddhist Chants.  </em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Opera <em>Kiyo </em>first and foremost inspires to reveal a true human story in a thoughtful and entertaining way.</span></p>
<p><em>Kiyo</em>’s melodic musical score closely describes its character’s emotions and dramatic situations.        </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Ariel and Tom have no greater love and joy in life other than performing, studying, and composing jazz music.</p>
<p>They are a voice and guitar duo, as well as a couple (loving girlfriend and boyfriend) who were brought together by a common and <em>overwhelming passion for jazz music</em>. Audiences have commented that they are <strong><em>unusually talented and many have noticed their commitment to creating opportunities to share jazz music</em> with all-age audiences in their small hometowns and nearby towns of Westminster, Upperco, and Detour, Maryland.</strong></p>
<p>Since Ariel and Tom met and began playing together over three years ago, they have been performing monthly as well as weekly at local coffeshops, farmer's markets, and art galleries in their local, small town communities. In short, they have helped create live opportunities to hear and learn about the great American artform of jazz music, where there was no chance to hear it locally before. As both are professional musicians, all of their income stems from their music. While money has never been and never will be the reason they devote their lives to music, financial support is necessary to help them meet all the nearly-crippling expenses associated with getting to the gig and back as well as making ends meet as highly active and devoted creative musicians.</p>
<p><em></em> </p>
<p><em><strong>A note from Ariel and Tom:</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks for reading about us above. Now here is how you can help us keep our music in the ears of communities. These small, sleepy working-town environments need creative stimulation and opportunities to see live music, but  ... <strong>Nearly All<em> of our most beloved gigs do not pay anything in terms of money</em></strong> and so we have been having <strong>great</strong> <strong>difficulty in covering expenses</strong> for doing these performances. But we truly cherish the chance to touch peoples' lives with our music. Our expenses are mainly things like travel (gas and vehicle) and parking fees but we are also under pressure to repay college loans and help meet basic needs such as food for our stomach, decent clothing, and proper equipment for our performances. For example, Ariel has been borrowing a undendable P.A. system for our performances and Tom's guitar amp has stopped working properly. Simply put, we are facing large expenses that are necessary to help keep us performing for our beloved audiences at places like Birdie's Cafe in Westminster, MD. <strong>Since we have almost no income from our concerts, we are not sure where we will find the money to fund our creative passions and help us keep the musical giving coming. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>The great thing about our campaign is that we are already out there giving it our best effort and our cause is already being felt by jazz lovers in our area.</strong> Our audiences cannot get enough of our music and we do not want to disappoint them by not being able to: pay for gas to get to the gig, park, have a decent amp and sound equipment, and get back home safely that evening. We don't ever want to stop sharing music because it becomes too financially burdensome to do so. Our job is to make music-it doesn't bother us that we don't get paid for it..but we just want to keep doing our job. You never know who is listening and may fall in love with music, too.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> <strong>The dream right now is just being able to cover the expenses we have incurred by making the music we do.</strong> <strong>Every Little bit Counts right now.</strong> We just want to keep on the highly creative and productive path we have been pursuing un-funded for over the past three great years. We don't want to lose momentum now!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day we would love to begin work on a CD or recording but perhaps that will the be the topic of another campaign some day. <strong>If we do exceed our goals for expenses, however, we will defintely put the extra funds towards our first recording as well as continuing our musical education of jazz in graduate school-which we both fully intend to accomplish someday!</strong></p>
<p>Also, have a look at our perks! We hope you enjoy the chance to be ""in the club"" of a great jazz master.</p>
<p>As we begin to cover expenses, we will certainly be able offer more material perks in a future campaign, perhaps we will be able to afford a website and offer you our CD recording.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If what we are about excites you and inspires you to action, we will be forever grateful. If you'd prefer not to offer any monetary funding remember that you can help immensely by letting others know about us using the share tools here. Put us on your facebook page or text a friend who may be interested, too. </p>
<p>Remember that by helping us, you are also keeping creative music in small-town communities that truly need the enrichment and enjoyment of Live artistic music. Live music performance is becoming a less common occurence but Ariel and Tom are committed to changing that.</p>

<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"">What</font></h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">Jazz trio Paradigm Shift is recording a new album entitled <i>Sounds Like Us</i>. As we explain in the video, Paradigm Shift's mission is to make music that continues to expand the role of the organ, come up with fresh approaches to baselines and rhythms, and (last but certainly not least!) write memorable<i> tunes</i>. The album will feature compositions from all three of our members and feature appearances by very special guests and longtime friends of the band Wycliffe Gordon and Marcus Printup. We strive to make music that is both accessible to the average listener and compelling to the trained ear. We can't wait for you to hear our latest work and get this show on the road.</font></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"">Why</font></h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">The goal of this project is to raise $8,000 which will help us offset the cost of high-end recording, mixing, manufacture as well as promotion to achieve the utmost quality in every department. </font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">Your contribution will go towards ensuring that Paradigm Shift -- a seasoned, highly ambitious, forward-thinking jazz trio -- will be able to make the highest quality album that it possibly can. You contribution will of course help the bank, but on a broader scale will also have an impact on jazz music as a whole because that is what this Paradigm Shift strives to do. Each member of the group has dug deep to come up with compositions that not only work for this album but stand the test of times as TUNES. Melvin Henderson, Gerry Youngman and Sean Jefferson all see the songs they brought in for this album as an attempt to reach the essence of jazz, songs that work not only in a trio format but in any configuration of instruments. As a band, Henderson, Youngman and Jefferson were all very deliberate about sifting through the tunes and working them into shape in rehearsal and asking themselves ""do we have a body of music that honors jazz history while also reaching beyond genre to speak universal truths?""</font></p>

As a band, Henderson, Youngman and Jefferson were all very deliberate about sifting through the tunes and working them into shape in rehearsal and asking themselves ""do we have a body of music that honors jazz history while also reaching beyond genre to speak universal truths?""

The plan is to have an album launch party next August in Finland  but it is going to take a lot of hard work (and money) between now and then to get this done. 
The estimated cost of producing this album is $15,000 - and this is where you come in: if you are kind enough to donate to this project, as well as earning the perks listed, and Alan's eternal gratitude, every last pfennig of your financial support will go towards the following:

session musicians, studio hire & travel
recording, mixing, and mastering 12 completely original songs
publicity & promotional material for the album & its release
manufacturing, printing & delivery of the CD

Heartfelt thanks ahead of time for your support, and a big shout out to those who have already helped get this project off the ground - especially Dan Cox, Producer; Jon Cox, rhythm section; Svante at Chartmakers.fi - mix and mastering; and of course to the many family members and friends who are helping Alan realise his dream - THANK YOU!
Flexible funding simply means that if the target is not met the funds will still be put to use reaching Alan's goal - this album will be made!!And if you can't support us financially, please  spread the good word and help us reach as many people as possible - with your help we will  get this done!

<h2>Portrait Maker Makes a Record</h2>
<p>In April, I will be bringing a 12 piece version of Portrait Maker to Fantasy Studios in Berkeley. The record we will make there will be a culmination of my work as a composer, bandleader, and musician during the last six years since I graduated college and before I leave the bay area to enter grad school. Please consider pre-ordering the record here to help me raise funds to pay for the professional quality recording (at least one of your favorite multi-platinum records was recorded at Fantasy), and the giant band (full of Grammy award winning musicians*). Additionally, you can get access to the video we made of our <i>The World of Dogs</i> multi-disciplinary and multi-media storytelling concert experience, or commission a drawing or painting (get it? <i>Portrait</i> Maker), or choose from a number of other special ""perks.""</p>
<p style=""font-size:10px;""><i>*they really are all good musicians but none of us have Grammys**<br/>**yet</i></p>
<p><strong>Portrait Maker will include </strong>(but may not be limited to)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size:12px;"">Roger Kim: acoustic guitar, banjo<br/>Ryan Pate: acoustic guitar<br/>Andrea Wang: voice<br/>Marica Petrey: voice<br/>Debbie Gold: flute<br/>Michelle Lee: alto flute<br/>Steven Lugerner: alto flute, Bb clarinet<br/>Jason Gillenwater: Bb clarinet<br/>Kyle Beard: bass clarinet<br/>Zachary Hazen: violin<br/>Mia Nardi-Huffman: violin<br/>Evan Buttemer: viola<br/>Misha Khalikulov: cello</p>
<h2>PERKS</h2>
</div><div>
<h3>The <strike>EP</strike> full length record</h3>
<p>All contributions above $10 will come with an advanced download of the EP. All perks $50 and above will also come with a physical CD copy of the record.</p>
<h3>The World of Dogs</h3>
<p><i>The World of Dogs</i> is Portrait Maker's multi-disciplinary multi-media storytelling event featuring music, video, dance, and live narration. Over the course of one night 10 musicians, 3 dancers and 2 narrators tell an <font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">allegorical tale about the secret underground economy run by dogs, how it relates to the gentrifying bay area, and how finding solution that seems too easy, too simple, and too good to be true may lead to </span>disastrous<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> consequences. If you are only now just learning about <i>The World of Dogs</i>, it's too late, we've already performed it last December and you missed it.</span></font></p>
<p><font>Not to worry! because you now have a second chance to see the whole thing in 1080p glory. You now have the option to contribute $25 to download video of the entire show, or $50 to get the DVD. All contributions $100 and over will include the DVD (or download - your choice).</font></p>
<h3><font>Animal Animal Animal Animal Animal Portraits and Custom Drawings</font></h3>
<p><font>It is a little known fact that the ""Portrait Maker"" in Portrait Maker is me, and that I have a soon to be viral <a href=""http://animalanimalanimalanimalanimal.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> that displays my portraits of people with very appropriate animals. For a very low price you can have your own animal portrait (delivered by mail and be immortalized on the web). Unfortunately you cannot choose your own animal, the process for selecting animals is a closely guarded secret. If you want to have a animal portrait with a specific animal, you have to choose the custom drawing option. If you do this, be sure to let me know you want an animal portrait with a specific animal.

</div></div>","Portrait Maker Makes a Record
In April, I will be bringing a 12 piece version of Portrait Maker to Fantasy Studios in Berkeley. The record we will make there will be a culmination of my work as a composer, bandleader, and musician during the last six years since I graduated college and before I leave the bay area to enter grad school. Please consider pre-ordering the record here to help me raise funds to pay for the professional quality recording (at least one of your favorite multi-platinum records was recorded at Fantasy), and the giant band (full of Grammy award winning musicians*). Additionally, you can get access to the video we made of our The World of Dogs multi-disciplinary and multi-media storytelling concert experience, or commission a drawing or painting (get it? Portrait Maker), or choose from a number of other special ""perks.""
*they really are all good musicians but none of us have Grammys****yet
Portrait Maker will include (but may not be limited to):
Roger Kim: acoustic guitar, banjoRyan Pate: acoustic guitarAndrea Wang: voiceMarica Petrey: voiceDebbie Gold: fluteMichelle Lee: alto fluteSteven Lugerner: alto flute, Bb clarinetJason Gillenwater: Bb clarinetKyle Beard: bass clarinetZachary Hazen: violinMia Nardi-Huffman: violinEvan Buttemer: violaMisha Khalikulov: cello
PERKS

The EP full length record
All contributions above $10 will come with an advanced download of the EP. All perks $50 and above will also come with a physical CD copy of the record.
The World of Dogs
The World of Dogs is Portrait Maker's multi-disciplinary multi-media storytelling event featuring music, video, dance, and live narration. Over the course of one night 10 musicians, 3 dancers and 2 narrators tell an allegorical tale about the secret underground economy run by dogs, how it relates to the gentrifying bay area, and how finding solution that seems too easy, too simple, and too good to be true may lead to disastrous consequences. If you are only now just learning about The World of Dogs, it's too late, we've already performed it last December and you missed it.
Not to worry! because you now have a second chance to see the whole thing in 1080p glory. You now have the option to contribute $25 to download video of the entire show, or $50 to get the DVD. All contributions $100 and over will include the DVD (or download - your choice).
Animal Animal Animal Animal Animal Portraits and Custom Drawings
It is a little known fact that the ""Portrait Maker"" in Portrait Maker is me, and that I have a soon to be viral website that displays my portraits of people with very appropriate animals. For a very low price you can have your own animal portrait (delivered by mail and be immortalized on the web). Unfortunately you cannot choose your own animal, the process for selecting animals is a closely guarded secret. If you want to have a animal portrait with a specific animal, you have to choose the custom drawing option. If you do this, be sure to let me know you want an animal portrait with a specific animal. Custom drawings can be anything, but be advised that I am not a professional drawer, so be realistic about what you ask for. All drawings will likely be in pencil, charcoal, acrylic paint, and/or sharpie marker on paper.

<h3>About my project: </h3>
<p>Hi!!! I am <a href=""http://www.jijiguitar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jiji</a> (Jiyeon Kim), a Korean Classical guitarist based in Brooklyn, NY. I am in the midst of working on my debut EP, focusing on works that I perform regularly in 2017-18 season. </p>
<p>This EP consists works from the Baroque to contemporary, I love bringing unusual repertoire to my audience-- in my recitals, I will perform pieces on the classical guitar then the next piece would be on the electric guitar! I love all different types of music and I think it's important for me to share that love and passion with the audience.</p>
<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>Applauded by the Calgary Herald as “…talented, sensitive…brilliant,” Jiji is an adventurous artist on both acoustic and electric guitar, playing an extensive range of music from traditional and contemporary classical music to free improvisation. Her impeccable musicianship combined with compelling stage presence and fascinating repertoire earned the Korean guitarist First Prize at the 2016 Concert Artists Guild International Competition.</p>
<p>Following recent performances at the 92 nd Street ‘Y’ Guitar Fest and at Festival Napa Valley, Jiji has a busy 2017-18 season, featuring her New York recital debut at Weill Recital Hall on the CAG series, along with recitals for the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts in Illinois, Lincoln Center in New York, Purdue Convocations in Indiana, and the Virginia Arts Festival(co-presented by the Tidewater Classical Guitar Society).</p>
<p>The Kansas City Star described Jiji as “A graceful and nuanced player,” adding that “…she presented an intimate, captivating performance” in its review of her recent appearance as guest soloist with Kansas City Symphony and conductor Carlos Miguel Prieto. Upcoming concerto appearances include the Great Falls Symphony (MT), Roswell Symphony (NM), and the Southwest Michigan Symphony.</p>
<p>Currently sponsored by D'Addario Strings. Jiji’s performances have been featured on PBS (On Stage at Curtis series), NPR’s From the Top, WHYY-TV, FOX 4-TV, Munchies (the Vice Channel), The Not So Late Show (Channel 6, Kansas), and Hong Kong broadcast station RTHK’s The Works.</p>
<p>A passionate advocate of new music, Jiji has premiered a duo piece Talking Guitars by renowned<br/>composer, Paul Lansky, and her subsequent studio recording of that work (with young Chinese guitarist Hao Yang) will be released on Bridge Records in the 2017-18 season. As a recipient of the 2017 BMI commissioning award resulting from the CAG Competition. Jiji has commissioned Nina C. Young to write a new guitar piece scheduled for premiere in early 2018. She has premiered works by numerous emerging composers, including Gabriella Smith, Riho Maimets, Krists Auznieks, Gulli Björnsson, Andrew McIntosh, and Farnood HaghaniPour.  </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Storytelling is at the heart of my music and the content I create. Many of you know me as a composer, bandleader and pianist/vocalist. Now, I'm taking my art further with addition of visual content - hence, a music video.</p>
<p>This video is my way of trying to use my music as a vehicle of social change and expression. To awaken what's hidden, to say what we are thinking, using music as a barrier-breaker.</p>
<p>Who Can Relate tells a story of human isolation and connection told through the lens of two strangers who pass on the sidewalk. We learn how compassion and an intentional disconnect from our technology has great rewards.</p>
<p>With your support, we hope to acquire the equipment and resources needed to produce a professional and commercially-viable product that is marketable to a national audience through social media platforms, YouTube, festivals and competitions. </p>

</div><h3>Ground control to Major Tom...</h3>I'm a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist who performs with <a href=""http://bethkinderman.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Beth Kinderman &amp; the Player Characters</a>,
 a geeky progressive rock band. Since 2009, my bandmates, my friends, my
 husband, and I have operated Space Oddity Music Club &amp; Brew Pub, a 
room party at the annual MarsCon science fiction convention in 
Bloomington, MN, taking place this year from March 4-6, 2016. On both 
nights of the con, Space Oddity opens its doors to feature several 
varieties of geeky entertainment with a focus on concerts and 
music circles. Our main goal is to give convention attendees the chance to join a circle with a diverse 
group of musicians (from beginners to professionals) and perform for an 
appreciative crowd.<br/><br/>To learn more about Space Oddity's history and philosophy, check out our successful IndieGoGo funding campaigns from <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/space-oddity-music-club-brew-pub-at-marscon-2013/x/2103678"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2013</a>, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/space-oddity-music-club-brew-pub-at-marscon-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2014</a>, and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/space-oddity-music-club-brew-pub-at-marscon-2015"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2015</a>.
 The geek community has always supported our party through its 
generosity of time, money, and spirit, and we were thrilled to exceed 
our crowdfunding goal the past three years running. <br/><br/><h3>Commencing countdown, engines on</h3><p>We try to bring more than just music to our community. In addition to Space Oddity's music circles, guests at our party can play 
board and card games from our personal libraries, snack on a variety of 
foods including delicious cheeses and fresh home-baked cookies, or 
sample beverages including Wall's End English brown ale from our 
favorite local brewery, <a href=""http://northgatebrew.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northgate Brewing</a>.</p><p>As many of you are also aware, David Bowie, whose music gave our party its name, recently passed away. We can't let this year's celebration pass without honoring him, so on Friday night of the party we'll also be hosting a sing-along and tribute and serving a specialty cocktail inspired by one of his songs.<br/></p><p>The money in our goal amount will be used as follows:
</p><h3><ul>
<li><p>$300 to reserve a hotel room for both nights of MarsCon and to leave a generous tip 
for the hard-working people who kindly clean up after us.</p></li>
<li><p>$200 for our keg of Northgate Brewing Wall's End beer and for ingredients for our David Bowie tribute cocktail.</p></li>
<li><p>$150 for food - cheese, crackers, meats, chocolate, and cookie baking supplies.</p></li>
<li><p>$200 for IndieGoGo fees, perks, and other incidental expenses 
incurred in the course of throwing the party (sign printing, masking 
tape, ice, that thing we forgot at home that we realize we really need 
at 6:30 p.m. Friday...).</p></li>
</ul></h3><p>This year, in honor of David Bowie, any funds raised in excess of our costs will be donated to charity. Half will go to one of our namesake's preferred charities, <a href=""http://keepachildalive.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Keep a Child Alive</a>, and the other half will go to cancer research.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Take your protein pills and put your helmet on</h3><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a crowdfunding campaign without great perks to encourage you to donate! You'll see that this year, many of our perks share a common theme. Here are a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Badge ribbons:</strong> 
Customized ribbons that affix to your membership badge are a tradition 
at many Midwestern SF cons. A $5 donation gets you a ribbon emblazoned with the words ""There's a Starman waiting in the sky - Space Oddity 2016."" </li>
<li>
<strong>Custom engraved pint glasses:</strong> Donate $25 or more and 
receive a new and unique Space Oddity pint glass, beautifully engraved with some of the lyrics from the song that gave us our name.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Musical rewards: </strong>Once again, the bands and artists of TropeStorm Records have kindly 
agreed to perform for your amusement, whether that takes the form of CDs
 or of cover songs or originals recorded by your
 request.</li>
<li>
<b>New this year - You call it!: </b>If you'll be attending MarsCon this year, contributing at the $175 level earns you the right to request a beverage for us to stock in our bar, for you and perhaps a few of your friends.<b><br/></b>

<h3>Planet Earth is blue and there's something you can do</h3>
<p>Can't contribute cash right now, but still want to help make Space Oddity happen? Here are a few other ways you can help us:</p>

<h3>La petite histoire de Gen &amp; Marcus</h3>
<p>Geneviève et Marcus se sont rencontrés lors de leur parcours en jazz à la Faculté de musique de l’Université de Montréal. Ils ont vite eu un coup de foudre musical lors de leurs premiers jams ensemble.  Passionnés l’un autant que l’autre par le jazz et la musique folklorique, l’idée était toute naturelle de continuer à jouer ensemble et d’en faire un projet plus sérieux, ce qu’ils ont entrepris l’hiver dernier.  </p>
<p>Ils ont alors décidé de combiner leurs talents d’arrangement et de composition afin de constituer un nouveau répertoire original, tissé d’influences musicales variées.  Et cela, toujours dans un esprit de présenter une musique accessible, mais qui révèle une véritable recherche au niveau des mélodies, arrangements, structures et du son en général.  Depuis, leur duo violon-guitare résonne avec une poésie acoustique naturelle.  </p>
<p>La prochaine étape est de concrétiser ce projet sous forme d’enregistrement de qualité professionnelle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Le projet de EP</h3>
<p>L’objectif de cette campagne est de produire notre premier EP, soit un album de 6 titres.  Nous avons déjà plusieurs compositions qui ont été travaillées et retravaillées, et celles-ci seront bientôt prêtes à être enregistrées.  Le produit final permettra de diffuser notre musique au grand public et servira de carte de visite pour faire avancer le groupe.</p>
<p>Notre mission artistique est claire : faire vivre à notre auditoire (vous!) un instant de simplicité, de poésie, de moment présent et d’authenticité.  Cela s’incarne par la recherche d’une fraîcheur musicale, d’un folklore modernisé, d’une musique qui se distingue par ses mélodies touchantes, ses arrangements bien ficelés, savamment orchestrés, et par une complicité naturelle.  </p>
<p>Nos compositions proposent une version modernisée de la tradition folklorique en lui donnant de nouveaux accents, ce qui permet de rejoindre aussi bien les férus de jazz que les inconditionnels du folklore et les fans de folk et de bluegrass.</p>
<p>L’enregistrement du EP se fera au Studio du Chemin 4, bien reconnu dans la sphère trad.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>La campagne</h3>
<p>Les fonds recueillis serviront à couvrir divers aspects de la démarche de production : enregistrement, mixage, matriçage, réalisation d’une pochette, séance de photos, promotion, etc.  C’est grâce à vous que nous pourrons atteindre notre objectif et concrétiser le projet. Chaque don compte !</p>
<p>En même temps, vous avez la possibilité de réserver d’avance votre copie du EP, d’obtenir un macaron ou un bandeau tricoté à la main, de dîner avec le duo, et même de participer à une agréable soirée d’écoute en primeur !  Tout cela pour souligner l’immense reconnaissance que nous aurons pour votre appui.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>D’autres façons de nous aider</h3>
<p>Partagez !  Faites circuler le mot, faites écouter notre musique, parlez de notre campagne de sociofinancement autour de vous !  Nous vous en serons bien reconnaissants.</p>
<p>Nous vous remercions du fond du coeur pour votre aide et votre appui !  On vous garde très près de nous dans cette belle aventure. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Luthia</i> are a music trio based in Glasgow, Scotland, consisting of Martyn McKenzie, Scott Jack Glanville and Jamie Wilson. Together we have been writing and playing music as a group for over a year, aspiring to make music that pushes boundaries and connects with a diverse audience. As a band inspired by a multitude of ideas and approaches to music and art, we want to make our first release something more intimate and unique for people to experience.</p>
<p>This project will involve working closely with film-maker Lewis Landini and Black Bay Studios where we will work on the live music recording, alongside the filming of our music. Out of the studio with Lewis we will also explore and capture the landscape around the studio, with the vision of making a film that creates a relationship with the ever changing light and atmosphere of the landscape with the mood and dynamics of our music. </p>
<p>We intend for this project to produce a high quality document of our music as a live performance trio, offering people a way of connecting with us in a deeper way.</p>
<p>At the end of this project we will have created and released both; a 30 minute film, and a 15-20 minute Live EP consisting of tracks featured in the film.</p>
<p><i>Recently, we worked with Lewis Landini to produce a live music film of our song 'Roslyn' which you can check out below. </i></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our project requires a minimum of £2,500 to fully create and complete. </p>
<p><u><strong><i>Where The Funding Goes:</i></strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Studio:</u></strong> The studio, Black Bay Studios, is an essential element to our vision and ability to create this project due to the unique and specific qualities it has and what it allows us to capture in performance as well as the surrounding environmental setting. Funding raised will pay for our hiring of the studio and engineering costs. <a href=""https://www.blackbaystudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.blackbaystudio.com</a></p>

</div><p>Thank you from <i>Luthia</i>: Scott, Martyn and Jamie. </p></div>","Short Summary
 
Luthia are a music trio based in Glasgow, Scotland, consisting of Martyn McKenzie, Scott Jack Glanville and Jamie Wilson. Together we have been writing and playing music as a group for over a year, aspiring to make music that pushes boundaries and connects with a diverse audience. As a band inspired by a multitude of ideas and approaches to music and art, we want to make our first release something more intimate and unique for people to experience.
This project will involve working closely with film-maker Lewis Landini and Black Bay Studios where we will work on the live music recording, alongside the filming of our music. Out of the studio with Lewis we will also explore and capture the landscape around the studio, with the vision of making a film that creates a relationship with the ever changing light and atmosphere of the landscape with the mood and dynamics of our music. 
We intend for this project to produce a high quality document of our music as a live performance trio, offering people a way of connecting with us in a deeper way.
At the end of this project we will have created and released both; a 30 minute film, and a 15-20 minute Live EP consisting of tracks featured in the film.
Recently, we worked with Lewis Landini to produce a live music film of our song 'Roslyn' which you can check out below. 

 

What We Need & What You Get
Our project requires a minimum of £2,500 to fully create and complete. 
Where The Funding Goes:
 
Studio: The studio, Black Bay Studios, is an essential element to our vision and ability to create this project due to the unique and specific qualities it has and what it allows us to capture in performance as well as the surrounding environmental setting. Funding raised will pay for our hiring of the studio and engineering costs. https://www.blackbaystudio.com

 
Film-Maker: Our collaborator on this project is Lewis Landini,  an exceptionally talented, young and diverse film-maker with a distinct and dynamic approach to cinematography that is ideal for our project.

I am currently finishing Year 12 VCE. I'm passionate about Indigenous rights and want to work to better the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in whatever ways I can when I finish school. I have been heavily involved in activist circles these past few months and I believe the UN Youth Aotearoa Leadership Tour 2015 is another important stage of my activist work.</b></p>
<p><b>Last year in November, I traveled from my home in Geelong to Brisbane to protest the G20. I traveled independently and protested with hundreds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from across the continent to make the international community aware of the oppression and injustices that Indigenous peoples continue to experience. Spending that weekend in Brisbane was and still is a very important experience to me. I made many friends there and I spoke with elders and I learned about the struggles that my people face on an everyday basis. I gained a greater insight and valuable knowledge into Aboriginal sovereignty and real land rights by speaking with community leaders and grassroots activists. </b></p>
<p><b>I also hold the position of Year 12 FIRE Carrier at my school (Friends Igniting Reconciliation through Education) along with another young Aboriginal woman in Year 12. In this leadership role, I organize cultural activities and events for the Indigenous students at my school and in my personal role, I have aimed to raise greater awareness on the struggles that Indigenous peoples face today.</b></p>
<p><b>I was involved in National Youth Week 2015 and a 2 x 2 m poster of my face was displayed on an iconic Geelong landmark. You can read about my poster here; <a href=""http://streetface4.geelong.social/about/sample-page/315-streetface/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://streetface4.geelong.social/about/sample-page/315-streetface/</a></b></p>

<div><b>Whatever contribution you make, it will help me get one step closer to raising funds for the tour. My family isn't rich and so we often find it hard to pay for big trips like this. </b></div>
<div><b>Apart from the financial side of things, me going on this tour will help me gain valuable knowledge from Māori community leaders.</b></div>
<div><b>The Māori people have a treaty, unlike the indigenous peoples of Australia. I am interested to find out from Māori community leaders if this has improve their lives and status in New Zealand. </b></div>
<div><b> How can we preserve indigenous cultures? How can we ensure that indigenous peoples are still able to exist as cultured peoples, whilst still being able to be included, supported and given independence by the state? How will constitutional recognition benefit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples? How has New Zealand addressed indigenous disadvantage and land rights? It's question like this that I aim to answer and delve into whilst on the tour.</b></div>
<div><b>I will bring back valuable knowledge and insight back to my community and use it to further my activism and broaden my understanding of Indigenous rights and justice.</b></div>
<div><b>However, I can only do this if I have the funds - that's where your contribution comes in!</b></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What happens if I don't reach my fundraising goal?</h3>
<div><b>There's a big possibility that I won't be able to reach my goal in time, but I have devised ways around this. I will be applying for grants, applying for sponsorship and selling chocolates at my school as a back up plan in case my IndieGoGo project falls short. </b></div>

I'm a proud, 18-year-old Barada/Barna woman from Central Queensland. I am currently finishing Year 12 VCE. I'm passionate about Indigenous rights and want to work to better the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in whatever ways I can when I finish school. I have been heavily involved in activist circles these past few months and I believe the UN Youth Aotearoa Leadership Tour 2015 is another important stage of my activist work.
Last year in November, I traveled from my home in Geelong to Brisbane to protest the G20. I traveled independently and protested with hundreds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from across the continent to make the international community aware of the oppression and injustices that Indigenous peoples continue to experience. Spending that weekend in Brisbane was and still is a very important experience to me. I made many friends there and I spoke with elders and I learned about the struggles that my people face on an everyday basis. I gained a greater insight and valuable knowledge into Aboriginal sovereignty and real land rights by speaking with community leaders and grassroots activists. 
I also hold the position of Year 12 FIRE Carrier at my school (Friends Igniting Reconciliation through Education) along with another young Aboriginal woman in Year 12. In this leadership role, I organize cultural activities and events for the Indigenous students at my school and in my personal role, I have aimed to raise greater awareness on the struggles that Indigenous peoples face today.
I was involved in National Youth Week 2015 and a 2 x 2 m poster of my face was displayed on an iconic Geelong landmark. You can read about my poster here; http://streetface4.geelong.social/about/sample-page/315-streetface/
It would mean the world to me if I could reach my fundraising goal. Should you be in a position to donate, however small or big, I look forward to expressing my appreciation for your support.    What is the tour about and where will the funds go?
The UN Youth Australia Aotearoa Leadership Tour 2015 (29th June - 11 July) is about learning about indigenous rights and culture in Australia and New Zealand through a two-week tour of the North Island of New Zealand. Throughout the tour, delegates will; ""...meet and engage with a range of stakeholders in Australia and New Zealand involved in indigenous affairs including as academics, politicians, public servants and nongovernment organisations.""

The tour aims to educate delegates about the post and pre-colonial histories of Australia and New Zealand, as well as enabling delegates to compare and contrast the broad cultural similarities and differences between Indigenous Australians and Maori New Zealanders. On the tour, the other 15 delegates and myself will also develop an understanding of the social, cultural, economic and political and legal issues that affect the indigenous peoples of Australia and New Zealand with a particular emphasis on land rights, recognition in the law and governmental programs to address disadvantage in both countries. 



All of the funds will go towards to the $2300 registration fee for this tour which includes:


All flights
All breakfasts and dinners
All accommodation 
All ground transport
All scheduled activities 

A portion of the funds will also go towards purchasing warm clothing for winter in New Zealand as well as business attire for New Zealand Model United Nations (NZMUN).
Even if I do not reach my fundraising goal, all the raised funds will still go towards all of the above


    The impact your contribution will have
Whatever contribution you make, it will help me get one step closer to raising funds for the tour. My family isn't rich and so we often find it hard to pay for big trips like this. 
Apart from the financial side of things, me going on this tour will help me gain valuable knowledge from Māori community leaders.
The Māori people have a treaty, unlike the indigenous peoples of Australia. I am interested to find out from Māori community leaders if this has improve their lives and status in New Zealand. 
 How can we preserve indigenous cultures? How can we ensure that indigenous peoples are still able to exist as cultured peoples, whilst still being able to be included, supported and given independence by the state? How will constitutional recognition benefit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples? How has New Zealand addressed indigenous disadvantage and land rights? It's question like this that I aim to answer and delve into whilst on the tour.
I will bring back valuable knowledge and insight back to my community and use it to further my activism and broaden my understanding of Indigenous rights and justice.
However, I can only do this if I have the funds - that's where your contribution comes in!
    What happens if I don't reach my fundraising goal?
There's a big possibility that I won't be able to reach my goal in time, but I have devised ways around this. I will be applying for grants, applying for sponsorship and selling chocolates at my school as a back up plan in case my IndieGoGo project falls short. 
I'm resilient, open minded and optimistic. Not reaching my full goal won't bring me down.  Other ways you can help...

If you're not in a position to donate, you can certainly help me in other ways.

Please tell your friends and family, and anyone who you think might be interested in donating any amount of money. 
In whatever way you choose to help, I will be extremely grateful.Thank-you. :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Check out my Facebook page also: </p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/madclubbarcelona/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/madclubbarcelona/</a><br/><br/>Now in Barcelona I do not find a good guide to all that has to do with live music. It is hard to find jam sessions , open mics , little alternative concerts and believe me there are many. When you google live music barcelona allways you get sites that talk about where you can eat , sleep , and maybe they talk about 5 bars that do live music.  Musicians have a hard time finding gigs to play , and bar owners have a hard time to reach clients. We all loose hours to find information and in the end we give up. This is a shame , with todays technology we should have this info within 5 min. <br/><br/>To create more opportunities for artists in Barcelona and make it easier for local people and tourists to find all these alternative places I want to create a platform about live music in Barcelona. I call it a platform because I want to include : <br/><br/>1. Calender of events going on big and small<br/>2. List of venues - bars that organise live music <br/>3. List of Local Artists . <br/>4.

Check out my Facebook page also: https://www.facebook.com/madclubbarcelona/Now in Barcelona I do not find a good guide to all that has to do with live music. It is hard to find jam sessions , open mics , little alternative concerts and believe me there are many. When you google live music barcelona allways you get sites that talk about where you can eat , sleep , and maybe they talk about 5 bars that do live music.  Musicians have a hard time finding gigs to play , and bar owners have a hard time to reach clients. We all loose hours to find information and in the end we give up. This is a shame , with todays technology we should have this info within 5 min. To create more opportunities for artists in Barcelona and make it easier for local people and tourists to find all these alternative places I want to create a platform about live music in Barcelona. I call it a platform because I want to include : 1. Calender of events going on big and small2. List of venues - bars that organise live music 3. List of Local Artists . 4. List of Music Schools, workshops, etc5. List of Music shops 6. List of Recording studios. 7. Information on street performing , where, laws,..8. Newsletters, interviews with local bands 9. Create a mobile app to find live music. 10. And many more ideas and information. Now to make this come true I need funding. I need money for programming / Constructing website and mobile app. All that has to do with the website like SEO optimization and so on.. This platform should be in different languages. Venue owners and artists should be able to make a profile and upload their events , music , pictures,.. Setting all this up and connecting everything is a really big job.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hi Sub-Radio family,</p>
<p>2019 has been a year of really incredible firsts for us. We started it by flying to Los Angeles to record the collection of songs that would become <i>Dog Years</i>, the EP that we’ve been tirelessly promoting and touring on for the last nine months. It was the first time we’d worked with a producer, the first time we’d gone on a real tour (!), and the first time that we all made the scary, crazy, exhilarating decision to make Sub-Radio our full-time job.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578445168/eybstjkifwj9ryflijan.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>DC9, Washington, D.C., July 2019 (Photo by Kurt Heyde)</i></p>
<p>We ended the year huddled in a carriage house in rural New Jersey, sequestered for 10 days as we tweaked and refined the songs we’re going to share with you this spring. This EP is going to take us in some new and challenging directions, sonically and lyrically. We can feel the color palette we paint with expanding. And honestly, these songs mean more to us than anything we’ve created so far.</p>
<p>We’re attacking 2020 with a vengeance. We’ll be heading to SXSW in March, touring for most of the year, and investing in PR and marketing to get this music in front of the world. It’s an insane amount of work, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>Of course, this all comes with a lot of costs. As a truly independent band, there are so many hurdles to success -- and a big one is money. Our community of fans and friends has gotten us this far, and we're asking for your help one last time in 2020.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Specifically, we need to raise <strong>$12,000</strong> to support all our activities this year. That includes a portion of the costs of recording, mixing, and mastering our entire EP (<strong>~$9,000</strong>); producing a music video for a single off the EP (<strong>~$2,000</strong>); and paying the incredible people who design our shirts, take our photos, and pitch us to the press. Even if we hit that goal, we'll still be digging into our own pockets throughout the year. The music industry is expensive as hell, y'all.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we can't do this on our own. So your help is absolutely critical to helping us succeed. </p>
<p>We’ve done a little math — if all the people who came to a Sub-Radio show in 2019 gave just a little bit, we’d never have to ask for money again. We can get there, but only with your help.</p>
<p>To thank you for your support, we'll be sending personalized and signed copies of the EP, custom stickers specifically for our Indiegogo backers, Sub-Radio t-shirts, credits in our liner notes, and a lot of other exciting rewards. Check out the full perks list to see what makes sense for you.</p>

<p>I started playing at a young age, and quickly found a love for playing guitar and singing. Many different styles have influenced me over the years. From Country, Metal, Rock, to Punk, I’ve played it all and still listen to a lot of it to date.</p>
<p>I have always been fond of the old Country music icons like Randy Travis, Conway Twitty, Don Williams, and Johnny Cash. With a resonating tone in my voice that is reminiscent of those giants in music, I carry on that deep Baritone bellowing country vocal sound within the music I play and write.</p>
<p>My original songs have a style that mixes a number of those various influences, capturing the essence of those Country roots. My songs are very personal and there is a lot of emotion that I pour into them. Living through those moments of desperation, loneliness, and heartache, the moments of joy, success, and hope too… We all have our share of both sides of the coin.</p>
<p>I am planning on a full studio recording &amp; production of 11 of my songs. I've always done quick live sessions with an acoustic guitar, and that just does not do these songs justice. I get some amazing feedback from my music, and it always boils down to ""I wish there was a studio recording, that would be on my daily playlist for sure..."" type of reactions. I have the amazing Engineer and Producer David Ponder ready, once there are funds for the project.</p>
<p>Being able to get these tracks done by a true professional would fulfill a huge goal of mine. I could then reach the masses, via Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Facebook, etc. I can, more importantly, get more gigs which is hard to do without a good recording of my music.</p>
<p>I will need $10,000.00 to fund the project. That goes toward pre-production, recording, engineering, producing, cover rt,etc. I am hopeful that I can get 1000 CD's made for merch as well.Basically, the whole ShaBang!</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>I have some very perks in mind:</li>
<li>hand written thank you notes</li>
<li>Professional photos w/ personal note 5x7</li>
<li>original hand written lyric sheets for a song(s) of your choice</li>
<li>Story telling of the songs origin and meaning</li>
<li>Live Recording of a rehearsal session, just me and my dog</li>
<li>thank you list in the liner notes of the CD</li>
<li>In-Home Concerts(dates and times TBD)</li>
</ul>
<p>If for some reason I do not meet or exceed the final 10k goal, I will use what funds I do get to make as much of the recordings as I can. Perhaps an EP will come out of it. Perhaps only a couple of singles. It is all up to you all, and me of course to push this as far as I can.</p>
<p>I have been struggling for a long time on my own trying to make this happen.  Old &amp; rickety vehicles break down, Appliances on the fritz, childcare financial needs, you name it. I unfortunately don't make enough between working Full Time and playing gigs, to save and get this done on my own.  This is why I'm asking you to help me make this happen.</p>

<h3>Hey there! We're making a Full Length Children's CD!</h3>
<p><u>The Story:</u> Our names are Fariss and Eva Ryan and we have been working with the children of Weaverville, CA for almost three years now. From our kids Sunday School lessons, we and the children have written and recorded 10+ tracks of fantastically catchy songs!<br/>You can listen to a sample of the new music is in the video above. <br/><br/>We've done this sort of thing before <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/151538189/stowaways-ep?ref=user_menu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>, but we've discovered how to do more with less. <br/>You can listen to our last project ""Stowaways EP"" on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/stowaways-ep/id1161626752?app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iTunes</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1fRD4ar4V1oxjeTk78-9XA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong><br/>Our vision is to release 100+ free hard copy albums to the children in our church community and town. To do this there are financial hoops to jump through like copyrighting, mixing and mastering, production...etc. <br/>This is where you can partner with us to get the CDs into the hands of the children! <br/>There are some fantastical perks available to those who donate to the Cartwheels project!<br/>You can check them out on the sidebar.<br/> </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Hey there! We're making a Full Length Children's CD!
The Story: Our names are Fariss and Eva Ryan and we have been working with the children of Weaverville, CA for almost three years now. From our kids Sunday School lessons, we and the children have written and recorded 10+ tracks of fantastically catchy songs!You can listen to a sample of the new music is in the video above. We've done this sort of thing before here, but we've discovered how to do more with less. You can listen to our last project ""Stowaways EP"" on iTunes, and Youtube. 
Vision:Our vision is to release 100+ free hard copy albums to the children in our church community and town. To do this there are financial hoops to jump through like copyrighting, mixing and mastering, production...etc. This is where you can partner with us to get the CDs into the hands of the children! There are some fantastical perks available to those who donate to the Cartwheels project!You can check them out on the sidebar.

Contrast is created with the replacement of the baritone saxophone with the soprano saxophone, adding another fiddle-like melodic instrument to the mix.

This creative and spiritually connected band held early rehearsals in complete darkness to have an unobscured focus on developing their musical and aural connection. These rehearsals guided them as they targeted each other’s individual sounds. Duos and trios formed within the ensemble, as well as building and molding the sound of the band.

<p>This campaign will complete our journey into the 21st century by adding heat and air conditioning to our historic theater.

</div></div>","Through hard work and the support of many believers, the Earlville Opera House has made a wonderful journey in the past 45 years. The once grand theater, that was on the verge of demolition, has made it all the way back. Today it is a venue that charms national performers to the delight of enthusiastic, appreciative audiences who travel miles for an evening in Earlville.
This campaign will complete our journey into the 21st century by adding heat and air conditioning to our historic theater. With this piece of our 45-year renovation in place, we will be able to expand our concert season to 12 months with heat for the cold months and comfort for our patrons in the heat of summer.

I’ve been playing bass guitar for 8 years.<br/><br/>When I was around 15 years old, I wrote in my journal that I would explode if I didn’t learn a skill. I wanted to be good at something. I was looking for  a purpose, and I’d always wanted to be in a band. But what would I play? I thought guitar was too hard because we’d been given one by a family friend and I hadn’t been able to figure it out. In my 15 year old mind,  I wasn’t learning it fast enough.  I figured that drums would be too much for me to carry around, place to place by myself, and too expensive.  But bass, seemed to fit me. I began to dream of playing bass. <br/><br/>It was the most noticeable part in all the music that I loved best. I was into  Booker T and the MGs, and obsessed with James Brown at the time. And I’d just started getting into The Clash and was particularly inspired by Joe Strummer’s story. The bass is solid and fun and I could be in the background since I was shy. I didn’t think that I could lead a band. I knew that I needed to play bass.  <br/><br/>My 4 siblings and I all went to the same high school. While the older ones were there, they were all members of the gospel choir. I was in middle school and my family would go to the concerts. I always intently watched whoever played bass for each song. They were some amazing bassists. Somehow, I got the guts to ask my brother’s friend, who was also the main bassist for the choir, if he could give me lessons.  He saw I really wanted to learn and that was key.  I may not have played without his help. When he left for college. he gave me his bass to keep because I didn’t have one of my own. Over the course of that year,  I practiced constantly, with a goal in mind. Once I was in high school too, I stepped out on a limb and I asked the Gospel Choir director if I could be the new bassist. She agreed.  She gave me a try and it meant lot. <br/><br/><br/>Bass and Songwriting became my purpose.  It was what I had and so I began to write my own songs on bass and to look for and hope for band members. I wrote guitar ideas and vocals to go along with the beats in my head. Since I didn’t have a band, I ended up trying to figure out a way to express all the parts of my songs on the bass, so that I could try to sing them.  I didn't at all expect to end up playing primarily solo, but I’ve gained so much insight from both playing alone and with a band.  I still prefer to play with friends.  I’m excited going forward to,  now have Elliot Napier as a bandmate on the drums<br/><br/>It’s been a winding road, but I am thankful for every person who has pushed me on in any way and there are many.

Hey, I'm Davey Lyon.
Again, the time has come to release a second Pulsar album, but it cannot be done without your help. Reaching my goal will allow me to release a well produced album,  enabling me to share my music with those who are interested in hearing it. 
Being a DIY artist has allowed me to have free range over my music, resulting in an album that is not influenced by the music industry. 
This album will feature Travis Orbin ,recording drums and Wally, who will be recording bass. For this album I've worked really hard to create a unique sound for you-- the listener-- , by using recurring melodies and themes. The album will consist of two parts that will be released separately. 
As great as this all sounds, unfortunately these things come with a price. I'd like to avoid trying to get signed by a record label and would rather do whatever I can to get this album out to you on my own. So what say you? Help me get this album out to you.  


What I Need & What You Get
Let me break it down for ya':

I need $3500 to finish this project.  Any money raised will be used to cover the cost of equipment, mixing and mastering the album and the album art work, 
Even if I don't reach my goal, all donations will go toward the completion of my album.

<h3>About Palm Tree Radio</h3>
<p>We know there is a whole host of Internet Radio stations available these days so why are we different? Well, there certainly is a load of stations on the 'virtual' dial but in the world of Trop Rock the choice is much more limited.</p>
<p>We are passionate about Tropical music and the feeling it can convey, from sitting on the shoreline to chilling in a hammock with a Pina Colada. We all need to escape the stresses of the world from time to time and that's something we like to offer, 24 hours a day, when you're ready to hit the beach.</p>
<p>Trop Rock itself is still a niche genre of music but we mix unsigned and undiscovered Trop Rock artists alongside some of the biggest names in Country and Reggae for an intoxicating blend of beach magic.</p>
<p>All this is done with our years of experience on radio stations in the 'real world' and we make a professional mix that sounds great piped around your house or sitting at your desk dreaming of the beach.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So the bottom line is quite simple, we LOVE playing the music for our many listeners but we also like to make sure we do it legally. That means we need funding for ongoing licences. We've got the tunes, we've got the volunteer team, we've got the equipment, this is the final step to ensure we broadcast the best beach mix.</p>

</div></div>","About Palm Tree Radio
We know there is a whole host of Internet Radio stations available these days so why are we different? Well, there certainly is a load of stations on the 'virtual' dial but in the world of Trop Rock the choice is much more limited.
We are passionate about Tropical music and the feeling it can convey, from sitting on the shoreline to chilling in a hammock with a Pina Colada. We all need to escape the stresses of the world from time to time and that's something we like to offer, 24 hours a day, when you're ready to hit the beach.
Trop Rock itself is still a niche genre of music but we mix unsigned and undiscovered Trop Rock artists alongside some of the biggest names in Country and Reggae for an intoxicating blend of beach magic.
All this is done with our years of experience on radio stations in the 'real world' and we make a professional mix that sounds great piped around your house or sitting at your desk dreaming of the beach.

What We Need & What You Get
So the bottom line is quite simple, we LOVE playing the music for our many listeners but we also like to make sure we do it legally. That means we need funding for ongoing licences. We've got the tunes, we've got the volunteer team, we've got the equipment, this is the final step to ensure we broadcast the best beach mix.

<p>Hi there! I'm Gabrielle Stravelli, a critically acclaimed New York-based singer and songwriter currently working on producing my first studio album, featuring EIGHT NEW ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS! (my debut album was released in 2011 and was recorded live because the rent is too damn high). </p>
<p>I am proud to say that I support myself entirely through making music- I have premiered a new song-cycle with Fred Hersch, toured with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, work as a teaching artist at NYC's Kaufman Center and in NYC schools and have performed 2 solo shows, both of which received <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/arts/music/gabrielle-stravelli-intoxicates-at-the-metropolitan-room.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rave reviews from the New York Times</a>. (woo hoo!) I recently returned from a month-long US State Department-sponsored international tour in which I worked with local musicians in various countries and performed with my own quartet. That experience restored my faith in the power that music has to create connections between people of vastly different backgrounds and to therefore be a force of good in the world. Music is important and I'm ready to make some of my own again. </p>
<p>You may now find yourself saying ""Well Ms. Stravelli, why do you need MY help in producing your CD? You're making it sound like you're awfully fancy...""</p>
<p>To which I can reply: ""Thank you! That's very kind of you to say! The fact is, that while I have had some awesome gigs and opportunities, those are career highlights. Many of the regular performing work I do in small clubs pays approximately $50-$100. I don't love this kind of work any less. It's just that being a working musician doesn't exactly= I'm a high roller!""  </p>
<p>Producing a professional studio CD costs around $20,000-$30,000, which is a tremendous amount of money in my world and yet it's essential for a musician to have this. It's been 5 years since I released an album and I must produce a new CD that reflects where I'm at as a vocalist NOW- since releasing that first album I've worked hard to continue honing my craft and happily, I can say that I've grown and improved a lot!

<h3>My Story: ""Song of the Soprano""....</h3>
<p>In any career field, to pursue our dreams we must work tirelessly at our craft and create or seize our own opportunities (or ""opera-tunities"") as they come as we pursue our dreams.  This is especially true in the world of opera and has been a large part of my story, or the melody in my song as a soprano.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am Elisa Rose Jordan, a young soprano who is about to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Music from Point Loma Nazarene University, a small liberal arts university located in San Diego, California.  When I began my university experience, pursuing a career as an opera singer was definitely not something I had considered as a career.  An interest in music, coupled with scholarship opportunities, led me to major in music, where I quickly fell in love with opera. Performing in<i> Amahl and the Night Visitors</i> and then having a lead in the <i>The Magic Flute</i> cemented this love.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As my sophomore year of college was ending, we learned to our chagrin that the opera program was going to be discontinued, something my friends and I could not bear to lose.  We united to create our own student-led organization, the ""Point Loma Opera Theatre"" (or PLOT, as we affectionately called it), in which I served as President during my Junior and Senior years.  We resourced and produced our own student-led, operated and performed operas, including works from Puccini, Purcell and Massenet!  Our performances were well received by the greater music community in San Diego and have led to many other ""opera-tunities,""  such as being a part of the San Diego Opera Chorus in <i>Madame Butterfly</i>, <i>Nabbuco</i> and <i>Turandot</i>.  My experience as President of PLOT also allowed me to create my own position as the Administrative Intern for the 2010 OperaWorks program. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Since I began my voice studies in college, I have been given and created opportunities for myself to be featured in operas, oratorios, recitals, choir concerts, numerous solo appearances and have won or placed in  several competitions. Here is a brief summary of what I've been working on this past year:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>

</div></div>","My Story: ""Song of the Soprano""....
In any career field, to pursue our dreams we must work tirelessly at our craft and create or seize our own opportunities (or ""opera-tunities"") as they come as we pursue our dreams.  This is especially true in the world of opera and has been a large part of my story, or the melody in my song as a soprano.

I am Elisa Rose Jordan, a young soprano who is about to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Music from Point Loma Nazarene University, a small liberal arts university located in San Diego, California.  When I began my university experience, pursuing a career as an opera singer was definitely not something I had considered as a career.  An interest in music, coupled with scholarship opportunities, led me to major in music, where I quickly fell in love with opera. Performing in Amahl and the Night Visitors and then having a lead in the The Magic Flute cemented this love.

As my sophomore year of college was ending, we learned to our chagrin that the opera program was going to be discontinued, something my friends and I could not bear to lose.  We united to create our own student-led organization, the ""Point Loma Opera Theatre"" (or PLOT, as we affectionately called it), in which I served as President during my Junior and Senior years.  We resourced and produced our own student-led, operated and performed operas, including works from Puccini, Purcell and Massenet!  Our performances were well received by the greater music community in San Diego and have led to many other ""opera-tunities,""  such as being a part of the San Diego Opera Chorus in Madame Butterfly, Nabbuco and Turandot.  My experience as President of PLOT also allowed me to create my own position as the Administrative Intern for the 2010 OperaWorks program. 

Since I began my voice studies in college, I have been given and created opportunities for myself to be featured in operas, oratorios, recitals, choir concerts, numerous solo appearances and have won or placed in  several competitions. Here is a brief summary of what I've been working on this past year:


Sang the title role in Massenet's Cendrillon

Soprano soloist in Handel's Messiah


Won the T. Davis Encouragement Award from the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions
Winner of the Virginia and Susan Hawk Memorial Scholarship in 2010 
Winner in the La Jolla Symphony Young Artist Competition for two consecutive years
Accepted to the nationally recognized OperaWorks Advanced Artist Program
Sang as one the youngest members of San Diego Opera's productions of Nabucco and Turandot

Preparing for my senior recital entitled ""Faces of Eve"" on April 9th




My latest ""opera-tunity"" came just this past February, when I was chosen as one of only 30 singers from more than 300 applications worldwide to participate in OperaWorks' Advanced Artist Program! (That's a 10% acceptance rate!!) This is a nationally recognized 4-week long program for singers with professional management or demonstrated major career potential. OperaWorks is renown for its innovative holistic approach to training singers, voice teachers, and coaches. Program studies include: 


Conducting
Music/Dramatic Analysis
Performance Techniques
Improvisation
Acting 
Yoga
Movement 
Alexander Technique
Coaching & Diction 
Marketing & Career Planning

The program will be held June 27th - July 24th on the campus of California State University Northridge under the direction of renowned opera coach and instructor, Ann Baltz.


Without a doubt, Ann Baltz’s OperaWorks stands above the rest in its unique ability to transform singers into complete artists.  The OperaWorks method is far more creative.  It encourages the individual singer to find and explore his or her own limits and go beyond.”
Gregory Buchalter, Assistant Conductor – The Metropolitan Opera


The Impact...

The OperaWorks program is not only an incredible opportunity for world-class training and professional networking, but I have personally witnessed the incredible personal growth in spirit of those who have attended. Alumni of OperaWorks are currently singing in many of the major opera houses of the world, such as the Metropolitan Opera, and are recognizable by their positive attitude and performance at auditions, competitions, and back stage! With your generous support of any amount, I, too, will be able to participate in this amazing journey of personal and professional growth. 

What I Need & What You Get...


For me to take advantage of this exciting opportunity, I need to raise $2,700 for the program's tuition. As one who will soon be graduating, I need more than my own meager resources to take advantage of this amazing opportunity. Your gift will enable me not only to attend the OperaWorks program, but also work and continue to grow as a performing artist!  I invite you to become a donor or sponsor of my participation in OperaWorks and follow my journey.

The loose change in your couch or car will be appreciated just as much as a check of $10, $25, $50, even $100, or any other amount of your choice. Your donation will go directly to the OperaWorks program and be used for no other purpose. Your gift is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE if made directly to OperaWorks (referencing me, of course!).

<h2><strong>The Country Mourns need sweethearts!</strong></h2>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Have you ever tasted the sweets of new love? C'mon we know that you have! Well, we are Mike and Jody and we have some new love to share with you! The kind of love that you feel when you see a pile of puppies or spend a warm day at the beach or when you get smacked with a bunch of wet kisses. We have 14 songs that are just like those warm fuzzy feelings, and we want to give them to you so that you can visit them over and over again forever.</p>
<p><strong>Okay! before skipping to the end of this for all the sweet kissing and the considered track list, will you please read the next three paragraphs?</strong></p>
<p>We both have been involved in music our entire lives. I suppose we were born blessed with songs in our hearts. But with that blessing comes the Catch 22 that though we have dedicated thousands of hours to learn how to sing and play and write, the art of creating music does not come cheap, we need funds just to be able to share the songs we create. Like a non-profit, we put all that we earn back into creating the music for you to enjoy. And like a non-profit, we need support to be as effective as we know that we can be.</p>
<p>In our many years of performing music in various genres and projects, etc.,  Jody and I have been lucky enough to see this concrete fact: that music and song produce a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without. We both are involved in sharing music with infants and young children, with teens and with adults, and we have seen that the love and happiness created out of little but melody, rhythm and lyric is powerful and wonderous.</p>
<p>The muses have given us more than a dozen brand new songs that are made up of the magical stuff that I am talking about. Of the hundreds of songs I have written, a few that have become well known and the majority best forgotten, I believe that these are my very best. The stars further aligned when Jody began to pursue roots and pop music. Her voice is the voice that I have long dreamed would sing my melodies.</p>

<h3>What you are helping us with.....</h3>
We debated long and hard about what monetary goal that we should set for this project. In this consideration we looked at what our expenses will be, what we hope to achieve, and what our peers who have run similar projects have required. While the goal we set may seem like a lot of money, it is in reality a little more than half of what we expect to spend to make these songs come to life and spread the joy contained within them to more than only those who we can reach in person.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have been involved in many recording sessions. The expenses include the studio itself, a producer/engineer, the extra musicians that we need to hire to flesh out the songs, and the post production of mastering. We are lucky that we can do our own artwork and do have a network of musical friends who will work at a discounted rate, but it will still require several thousand dollars to make this happen.</div>
<div>
<br/>A major label, for profit musician like Kanye West or Taylor Swift will have hundreds of thousands spent on recording their music. Smaller acts like Gillian Welch still require several tens of thousands of dollars. We can only expect a budget that is a fraction of these artists. However, the listener expects a relatively similar sonic sound, and that is only achieved through time and gear, which costs money. Most importantly,  we believe strongly that our songs will touch you in the same ways that a big budget song would even if we can not dream of having the same resources that those artists are blessed with.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER!<br/></strong></h2>
<p>We will forever be in a debt of gratitude to those who contribute to this campaign. But like the small yet viital group who contribute to, for instance, public radio, your contribution will not only be a benefit to The Country Mourns, but also to all of those who potentially will enjoy the songs we have written and the performances that we and our musical friends put onto tape.</p>
<p>Please put us to work! We will stretch every nickel and bend every penny to get these songs ready for you to sing along to in the comfort of your own home, car or headphones!</p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even the smallest contribution will help and will be greatly appreiciated. But beyond that, we are hoping that you are among our friends who will help spread the word about the campaign.</p>

<p>Our goal is to raise an additional $50,000 more to build a Phase One of the Downingtown Skatepark. This is our attempt to entertain you during our final push to raise this money. Check out our videos and news below these slides to see the timeline progress of this project. We do have the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) approval to build at our proposed location, so now all we need is your support to break ground in Spring 2013. We are thrilled that this project has come this far along and hopefully we can get the final push we need. This fundraiser will end Jan. 1 2013!</p>

Our goal is to raise an additional $50,000 more to build a Phase One of the Downingtown Skatepark. This is our attempt to entertain you during our final push to raise this money. Check out our videos and news below these slides to see the timeline progress of this project. We do have the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) approval to build at our proposed location, so now all we need is your support to break ground in Spring 2013. We are thrilled that this project has come this far along and hopefully we can get the final push we need. This fundraiser will end Jan. 1 2013!

<p>We are<strong> The Underline</strong>, a 5-piece band from Hopewell Junction, NY. We all have experience playing with previous bands, but are moving fast in the music scene. Within nearly 6 months, we have already recorded one single along with finishing up a 5 song EP.</p>
<p><span>This EP encompasses every emotion we could have put into our music. It is filled with catchy, fast-paced guitar riffed choruses, strong female vocal presence, and a rhythm section that is both intricate and simple. The Underline strives to play music that we love, covering genres from pop-punk to post hardcore to alternative. Influenced by artists such as Paramore, Evanescence, Set Your Goals, Fall Out Boy, Lights, and Green Day. Even with those influences, we are able to create a sound that is unique to us as a band.</span></p>
<p>We put all the money that 5 students enrolled in college had into this EP, and that is why we come to you to ask for your help. Recording an EP and having it pressed onto CDs is very expensive, and we cannot afford all of the costs on our own. Money that is donated will be used towards recording costs and CD printing, and any additional money will go towards touring costs (gas, food, etc.), band merchandise, and promotion.</p>
</div>
<p>Even if you are not able to make a donation, we appreciate the time you took to read this. Please share this with your friends and ask them to donate as well. Any form of publicity and advertising is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Last, we would like to thank everyone who has helped us get where we are in such a short period of time. In less than six months we have already written and recorded a five song EP, and continue to play shows at the support of our fans. We can't wait to share this EP with you all of you; thank you for giving us this opportunity.</p>

<p>Greetings everyone! Due to the effects of Superstorm Sandy in our region, we   have pushed the concert date back a week to Sunday, November 11,2012. It is still at the same place and time...The Spiritual Empowerment Center - Baltimore, 5 - 8 pm. Hope to see you there, and PLEASE Donate!</p>
<p>with gratitude - Deletta</p>
<h3>I'm Deletta Gillespie, teaching and performing artist/vocalist/songwriter...I wear a lot of hats.</h3>
<p>I have twenty-five years in the entertainment industry as a vocalist, actress, dancer, voice over artist, entertainment coordinator and educator. Currently I am on the performing arts faculty at a small university. And while teaching brings me great joy, these days, I find myself wanting to use my talents as a vehicle to help others. As an artist, I am passionate about the arts being a wonderful tool for social change, and all of the work I create, whether it be a play, a song, or some other kind of performance, can be categorized as work that promotes social change and healing. </p>
<p>For example, in 2006, I wrote and directed a play, ""What a Girl Wants"" that premiered in Bermuda. With sponsorship of nearly $4000 and shrewd advertising and marketing, my partners and I were able to donate nearly $15,000 to the Women's Resource Center in Bermuda. </p>
<p>And in 2011, I created a concert event that created awareness about the refugee rape crisis in Haiti. This year via that same concert series, I was able to raise funds and collect clothing for an organization whose focus is reentry for women rebounding from substance abuse. </p>
<p>I knew that human trafficking is a big problem in other places around the world, but I had no idea how big a problem it is in the US until I heard my minister speak about it in one of her sermons several months ago. Then I saw a documentary on PBS a week later, and knew that I wanted to raise awareness and funds around this issue at my next event. I have been a part of eleven CD's over the years, but have never recorded my own CD...mostly because of lack of funding, and, because my best performances happen in front of a live audience. So, after being nudged one more time, I decided that now was the time. I have merged them together for TRIUMPH, a cd of heartfelt, sometimes quirky songs from several genres of music (reggae, pop, rock, r&amp;b, latin) but all seasoned just a bit with the music my mother played the most...jazz. </p>
<p>I hope you join me in this venture. You contributions will go to defray the costs of the recording, mastering, and duplication of the CD and DVD. Ten percent will go to organizations such as Samaritan Women, a Baltimore-based organization that helps people who are the equivalent of modern day slaves gain their freedom. Another ten percent will go to my spiritual home, The Spiritual Empowerment Center, that creates and manages educational and outreach programs for children and youth in the region.</p>
<p>Perks include receiving the CD's and DVD's of course, but also getting mentioned on my website, to being able to advertise your product or company on my website for anywhere from 1 - 3 months. Also, if you donate before the Concert date, you will get a mention in the 'Roll Call' of donors during the performance. It will be recorded for posterity! </p>
<p>There are gift bags and other merchandise being offered as well, but as we are still finalizing those details and will keep everyone as the offers are completed.</p>
<p>If you are not able to donate at this time, YOU CAN STILL HELP by sharing this appeal with others. Also, do some research and see if there are organizations whose focus is also human trafficking.</p>

<h2><strong>Short Summary:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>My name is Scott MacMeeken. I have had a life long passion for music and documentory film. I was first introduced to the music of Albannach approximately three years ago. I have seen very few bands that are as passionate about what they are doing as members of the band Albannach.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is the first film that I have done of this magnitude. The band Albannach has given me the honor of helping me to pursue my dream as a filmmaker by allowing me to film and produce their newest DVD project. This honor I do not take lightly. I intend to give them, and fans, the most brilliant Albannach DVD to date.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By contributing to this project you will help ensure not only that the popularity of this great band continues to grow, but that people will be able to see Albannach on a grand scale.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are setting a goal of $5,000.00 to get this project started. Anything more then that will only help to futher this endeavor. Albannach has nearly nearly seventeen thousand fans just on facebook alone. If that many fans would donate simply one dollar, this production would be completely financed start to finish. You can also rest assured that 100% of any funds that you donate will be used only toward production costs for this DVD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We would not ask anyone to give their hard earned money without offering some rewards. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is what you get,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Douglas Package: $50.00 and you will receive an autographed copy of the completed DVD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MacGregor Package: $75.00 and you will receive the autographed DVD as well as an autographed t-shirt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wallace Package: $100.00 and you will receive the autographed DVD, t-shirt, and an autographed drum head.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due to touring constraints only one of the final package will be made available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bruce Package: The first person to donate $1,500.00 will receive all previously mentioned rewards, and Albannach will perform a concert at your private engagement! This of course will be negotiated by Albannach around scheduled tour dates and within reasonable traveling distance from concert venues.</strong></p>

<h3><em>To all my friends and family:</em></h3>
<p>Since 2009, I have been working steadily with talented and wonderful people—Michael Wethington and Christopher Hontos, Jason Edmunds and Cole Weiland, Micky Alfano and Joseph Berns, Sarah Burns and Jim Pfeffer—on a project that has vastly transcended our initial modest plan of simply playing music together to generate happiness for ourselves and those around us in the world. To date have already released <strong>eight major releases in a span of three years</strong> with the help of all the wonderful people at Moon Glyph Records in Minneapolis, Naturebliss Records in Tokyo, Debacle Records in Seattle, and several smaller record labels internationally. This includes cassette tape releases, compact-disc releases, <em>and</em> vinyl record releases, all of which are also available digitally.</p>
<p>For those who have understandably been doing it up in their own little corner of the world and have missed these FP things, a career-length review of our releases is available at <a href=""http://foodpyramidband.tumblr.com/sound"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://foodpyramidband.tumblr.com/sound</a>.</p>
<p>That this project has gone as far as it has is due in large part to the people in my life who have supported and encouraged me in artistic pursuits, past and present. I thank you now and forever for allowing me the freedom to ask questions and create new possibilities for sound and life. We have enjoyed a small degree of success in touring nationally, as well as playing locally: some memorable events include playing at Franklin Art Works in Minneapolis with NYC-based artist Conrad Ventur (<a href=""http://www.conradventur.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.conradventur.com/</a>), at Midway Arts in Minneapolis and at the Convent of St. Cecelia in New York City with international artist Raha Raissnia (<a href=""http://www.obsessionscollective.com/index.php?page=artist&amp;id=14"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.obsessionscollective.com/index.php?page=artist&amp;id=14</a>), as well as South by Southwest in Austin and the Square Lake Festival in Minnesota.</p>
<p>As I have devoted countless hours to this project, I have slowly begun to collapse the boundaries between it and my world outside of it to the point where I must be honest and declaim that anything extra I could ever gain monetarily in life would most certainly be funnelled into making this idea, this project, more clearly defined and and all-around better, brighter, faster, and stronger. I believe in what I do and in the people I choose to do it with, and want nothing more than to continue to make this a success.</p>
<p>Money is the simple tool that allows this to continue. This has become an important part of my life that I want to share with anyone who wants to listen. Any hope for holiday or name-day well-wishing in any other fashion than good cheer and mutual happiness has been co-opted by this very real and personal ambition to upgrade the tools of my trade and finance the realization of lasting musical documents with the people I love. You get the idea.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><em>What We Need &amp; What You Get</em></h3>
<p>For the next 60 days, I am aiming to raise $2000, or approximately $50 from approximately 40 people.</p>
<p>Each donation amount has a different perk!</p>
<p>I set this number because I have set my sights on upgrading my music production tools and this is the cost of doing so. A better music production situation will allow me to make and produce a more sophisticated body of work at a higher sound quality - immediately increasing my ability to pitch to higher-profile music licensing and production companies and allowing this project to move closer to self-sustainability. <strong>To date this project has already generated over $7,000 in licensing our music to companies such as Vionnet Paris and Outsell.com.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><em>The Impact</em></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In return:</p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>You will help me directly and I will consider your contribution a blessing.</p>
<p>If you are inclined to give gifts at holidays, you won't have to worry about getting me a physical gift for holiday or if I will like said gift.</p>
<p>You will never have to wonder if I secretly returned whatever it is you got me or surrender to indecision and buy a gift card to a store you hope I may like.</p>
<p>You will be helping not only myself, but countless others who have invested their time and energy in this project. </p>
<p>That's quite a deal!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, you will be participating in a <em>collective effort of support</em>, where, like NPR, $5, $10, or $25 is quite welcome, and everything above that ecstatically encouraged—but never expected. Your contribution pools towards the ultimate goal, which removes a lot of pressure on the material side of things. </p>

<p>Again, I don't expect miracles. The goal is just that: a goal. Anything less or more will still be utilized effectively and greatly appreciated.</p>

<p class=""western"">Hi! We're Peace Mercutio from Seattle, WA.  We're a alt. rock four-piece that's been around since 2011. We have two full-time vocalists Andy Lundman and Dan Buckley, a fantastic drummer Taylor Jurgens, and a brand new bass player Nick Emacio (lead singer of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thelookoutmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Lookout"">The Lookout</a>) Last October we released our first album <a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/news/Peace-Mercutio-Weather-The-Storm-Stream"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Weather The Storm"">'Weather The Storm'</a> it was an exciting time, and though not perfect, we felt it captured who we were as a band.  It also gave us an excuse to tour around the US.  After a two-week tour in August 2011, and a week-long tour March 2012, we realized that if we really wanted to make an impact, we were going to have to be on the road full-time.</p>
<p class=""western"">Which brings us to now.  You may have heard our newest single ""<a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/news/peace-mercutio-thats-how-good-charlotte-got-famous-video"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""(And That's How) Good Charlotte (Got Famous)"">(And That's How) Good Charlotte (Got Famous)</a>"" which will be the first track on a new 3-song EP due out in June.  Recording, promoting, and touring to make the most out of new music takes a lot of hard work and effort, and this time around, instead of staying in Seattle, WA (love Russel Wilson, and the Seahawks ok? know that) we want to bring the show to you. We just recently announced huge news that will be on tour with Emery, Wolves At The Gate, and The Seeking Apr 22 - May 13.

<h3 class=""western"">Why Crowd-Sourcing?</h3>
<p>We have seen crowd-sourcing being used in great ways to launch bands that people care about.  It's empowering musicians and their fans to work together to create music that would otherwise never be heard.  We hope that we can be a part of this phenomenon and use crowd-sourcing to deliver the music and live performances that our fans deserve.  We've set a high goal using flexible-funding, which means that we will be able to use whatever is raised even if we don't hit our goal.  We have done our best to show exactly how the money will be used, so you can be confident in what you are contributing towards.  We believe our fans care about the music we are making and can work with us to hit our goal.</p>

<h3 class=""western"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The most important thing you can do for us throughout this campaign is share what we're doing.  Posting about our indie go go campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking profile will help us more than you can imagine.  Share our new video, share our indie go go link, use the links above to share the campaign.  Tell your friends and family about that band with the weird Shakespeare reference for a name.  Not everyone will like the music, and not everyone will be able to contribute, but getting the word out will help us reach our goal.</p>

<h2>Nigredo's Debut Needs You!</h2>
<h3>Embrace our Nigredo moment!  </h3>
<p><strong>Nigredo has been meticulously creating and recording a musical effort dense with enigmatic movement and rich exploration of limitless dynamics and soundscapes. The end times has arrived, beckoning the official release of the much-anticipated debut, aptly titled Collapse and Resurrection, by a music collaborative considered ""among the city's elite artists, regardless of genre."" (LatestDisgrace.com)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Nigredo wants your help in completing what it’s started!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Astute and ever-evolving, the concepts and musical movements on Collapse and Resurrection are where Nigredo place their faith.

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p>¡Hola a todos! Somos una banda de mujeres que toca metal sinfónico y hemos estado trabajando arduamente en nuestro material original, del cual hemos ya compartido un par de canciones en público y hemos tenido una respuesta positiva y de mucho apoyo. </p>
<p>El proceso de hacer música es super gratificante, pero a la vez arduo y requiere mucha dedicación, por lo que nos encantaría ver cómo lo que hemos hecho cobra vida a través de  grabarlo y hacer videos, empezando por nuestra primera bebé, nuestro primer producto: Selene. Asimismo, nos encantaría compartir este material con todos ustedes y con gente de otros lugares del mundo que podría apreciar lo que hacemos.</p>
<p>Es realmente para nosotras un sueño poder hacer esto y les agradeceríamos muchísimo su colaboración &lt;3</p>
<p><strong>¿QUÉ NECESITAMOS?</strong></p>
<p>Esta campaña es para reunir fondos para grabar el video de nuestra canción Selene . Como saben, esto es bastante costoso, ya que requiere de mucho trabajo de profesionales durante muchas horas de dedicación para poder producir un material de excelente calidad. Por ello, cualquier cantidad que deseen enviar será de gran utilidad.</p>
<p>Asimismo, si no podés ayudar con dinero, igual podés ayudarnos enormemente al contarle a otros que quisieran colaborar también.</p>

<p><strong>Sziasztok! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Greetings!<br/><br/><br/>TÖRTÉNET / STORY (SCROLL FOR ENGLISH)</strong></p>
<p>Mi vagyunk a Leecher, a magyar szimfonikus-cselló metal zenekar. Tudtunkkal rajtunk kívül még senki nem ötvözte a csellók metalbéli használatát (amihez az utat az Apocalyptica járta ki) a nagyzenekari elemekkel. Az első lemezünk, a Sightless, 2016-ban jelent meg, azóta pedig játszottunk itthon, Romániában, Szerbiában, Bulgáriában, Horvátországban, Franciaországban, Németországban, Hollandiában, Olaszországban és Svájcban is.</p>
<p>Most eljött az idő, hogy megtegyük a következő lépést és kiadjuk a második lemezünket. A lehető legjobb zenét szeretnénk kiadni a lehető legjobb minőségben, de! Míg az első lemezünket egy versenygyőzelemnek köszönhettük, most nem áll mögöttünk hasonló forrás és ahhoz, hogy az álmainknak megfelelő minőségben hozhassuk ki a lemezt, szükségünk lesz némi segítségre.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>
<p>We are Leecher, a Symphonic-Cello Metal band from Hungary. As far as we know, we are the only band that combines using cellos instead of guitars (a concept pioneered by Apocalyptica) with symphonic elements. Our first album ‘Sightless’ came out in 2016 and since then, we have been doing shows at home, and in countries such as Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Now we want to go one step further and release our second album. We want it to be the best we can possibly do. But here’s the thing: most of our first album was funded by our victory on a contest. Without such a source behind us this time, we will need some help to be able to give something great to our fans.</p>
</div><div>
<br/><br/><strong>MIT KÉRÜNK ÉS MIT ADUNK?</strong>
</div><div> </div><div>
<p>A lemezünket feltétlenül fel fogjuk venni, de az álmainkban mindezt egy tapasztalt producer mellett tennénk meg, aki a fülével és a tudásával segít minket abban, hogy a lehető legjobb minőséget tehessük az asztalra, a lehető legjobb stúdióban és a legjobb emberekkel dolgozva. Ezen túl egy videóklipet is fogunk készíteni. Minden segítség ezeket a célokat támogatja és rendszeresen jelentkezni is fogunk a színfalak mögül.</p>
<p>November közepén lehetőségünk lesz egyetlen dalt, a Messenger Of Feart felvenni az említett körülmények között, így e hónap végén már hallgatjátok is, hogy pontosan mi is az a minőség, ami az álmainkban szerepel. A segítségetekkel az egész lemezt ugyanezen a színvonalon tudjuk majd megjelentetni!<br/><br/>Mindenki, aki segít nekünk, kapni fog egy digitális letöltést a lemezből. Ha úgy döntesz, hogy többel is hozzájárulsz a sikerünkhöz, különleges tartalmakban részesülhetsz, a kézbe fogható dedikált lemeztől az exkluzív pólókon át egészen a Leecher társasjátékig, amit sok év belső használat után kiadunk!</p>
</div><div>
<br/><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU'LL GET</strong><br/> <p>We are going to record our album no matter what, but our dreams include hiring an experienced producer with ears and knowledge to help us bring out maximum potential of our songs, in terms of arrangements and sound; and doing all this in the best studio with the best people we can afford. Also we will release a music video for one of the new songs.</p>
<p>Every cent we get goes toward these goals, and we will report on what is happening.</p>
<p>Thanks to a one-time opportunity, one song is already in the making. By the end of November, you can get a firsthand taste of how our dreams sound like. With your help, we can release an entire album in this quality.<br/><br/>For everyone who helps us out, we will give a digital copy of our album as a sign of gratitude. But if you decide to support us with a higher amount, more exclusuve content awaits you in the form of physical signed CDs, exclusive T-shirts available only through this event, and even a board game we have been playing for years but now we are releasing for you!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>HOGYAN SEGÍTHETSZ MÉG?</strong><br/><br/>- Terjeszd a kampány hírét!<br/>- Szólj a barátaidnak, akiknek úgy érzed, tetszhet a zenénk!<br/>- Gyere el a koncertekre!<br/>- Vegyél a koncerteken lemezt vagy pólót - jelenleg minden bevételt a lemezre fordítunk.<br/><br/><br/><strong>HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP</strong></p>- Spread news of this campaign<br/>- Tell your friends who you believe would like our music<br/>- Come to our shows<br/>- Grab merchandise at our shows - all our income is going towards making the album<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Hey everyone!  To those of you who don't know me, my name is Brent Shuttleworth.   I'm a singer and songwriter living in Nashville, TN.  It’s been almost TWO YEARS since the making of my last record ‘FEELS LIKE FLYING.’ I feel so fortunate (thanks to all of you) to have played over 250+ shows in almost every state in the US and met some people that have truly changed my life.  I am trying to raise 20K for this new project.  All told, this project is looking to cost upwards of 30K, however, with your contribution, I hope offset some of that cost.  Here are the 2 main things that I am working on:</p>
<p>1) NEW GROUP OF STUDIO RECORDINGS.  Anyone that knows me, knows that I try to make music that speaks directly to things that I've experienced.  For example, in this new group of recordings, I'm taking on some topics that are honestly, very uncomfortable for me to even talk about.  This includes my own experience with sexual abuse and clinical depression.  My hope is that others that have had a shared experience will find their own healing in this music.   The process of working on this has been really scary and overwhelming, but also something that I know I have to do.  On these recordings, I will be working with my brother and talented songwriter/producer, Mike Shimshack (Britney Spears, Jimmy Robbins, Joe Cocker, Laura Bell Bundy, Forever The Sickest Kids) and my close friend and collaborator producer/songwriter, Kyle Kelso (KYGO, Parachute).  These recordings will be mastered by Randy Merrill (Adele, Justin Bieber, Troye Sivan, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande).</p>
<p>2) VIDEO CONTENT.  In this new group of recordings, I want to develop a visual counterpart to the new music.  With your contribution, I'll be able to bring another dimension to the artistic experience.</p>
<p>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</p>
<p>A) NEW MUSIC</p>
<p>B) RIDICULOUS INCENTIVES </p>
<p>C) Your name in the album credits as an EXECUTIVE PRODUCER </p>
<p>D) NEW MERCHANDISE</p>
<p>Thank you so incredibly much for your unwavering support.  I am deeply humbled by everything that you have done and continue to do.  It means everything to me.  Also, if you don't have any funds to contribute to this campaign, THAT'S OK.  If you feel comfortable, feel free to share this on social media far and wide.  Hope to see everyone on the road again very soon.  </p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are WOODWOLF, a drum/guitar duo from Quebec City, Canada. Founded in 2013 by singer, guitar player and songwriter Frederic Moffet.<br/><br/>Following the departure of the ex group members, we have evolved into our actual duo with the arrival of drummer Alex Boutin. Since then we have participated in different band contests and played many shows in the underground music scene. After two years of refining our own music we were ready to take up a new challenge which was to create our first album: « Golden Road ».</p>
<p>This album is the accomplishment of many years of hard labour. We had to record our songs in order to share our music with our actual fans and to conquer new audiences. We had the opportunity to work with Dominic Pelletier (""Caravane"" and ""The Hunters"") as the producer and David Lizotte (""Hillward"" and sound engineer ) for the recording. We are extremely proud of the result and eager for you to hear it! We were also privileged to have David Paul Seymour, (""The Art of Rock and Roll"") for the album cover artwork. (<a href=""http://davidpaulseymour.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://davidpaulseymour.com/</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Résumé:</strong></p>
<p>Actif depuis 2013, WOODWOLF évolua en un duo drum et guitar en 2015. Croisement entre le rock, le grunge et le psychédélique, nous agençons plusieurs influences musicales, ce qui nous confère un style vintage et planant. Avec 11 chansons originales déjà enregistrées et masterisées, nous vous offrons une prévente d'album et des produits dérivés afin de nous aider à finaliser les dernières étapes du lancements de notre premier album ""Golden Road"".</p>
<h3>Qui sommes nous?</h3>
<p>Nous sommes WOODWOLF, un duo drum et guitare de Québec au Canada. Le band fut fondé en 2013 par Frédéric Moffet, chanteur, guitariste et auteur des chansons du groupe.</p>
<p>Originalement un trio, nous avons évolué sous la forme d'un duo en 2015 suite au départ des ex-membres du groupe et à l'arrivée du drummer Alex Boutin. Depuis, nous avons participé à quelques concours et joué dans plusieurs spectacles de la scène underground de la région de Québec. Après deux ans à peaufiner nos propres compositions semaines après semaines, nous étions prêts pour un nouveau défi, celui de lancer notre premier album ""Golden Road"".   </p>
<p>Cet album est l'accomplissement de notre travail acharné depuis plusieurs années. Il nous fallait immortaliser nos chansons en les enregistrant et ainsi pouvoir partager notre musique avec une audience plus large que celle qui vient nous voir en spectacle. Nous voulions aussi offrir à nos fans la possibilité de nous écouter partout avec un enregistrement bien produit et plus travaillé que les démos que nous avions déjà sur notre page Bandcamp. Nous avons donc saisi l’opportunité de travailler avec Dominic Pelletier (auteur-compositeur-interprète dans ""Caravane"" et ""The Hunters"") en tant que réalisateur et David Lizotte (auteur-compositeur-interprète dans ""Hillward"" et technicien de son pour ""Caravane"") à l'enregistrement. Nous sommes extrêmement fiers du résultat et nous avons hâte de vous le faire entendre! De plus, nous avons fait affaire avec David Paul Seymour, ""Th Art of Rock and Roll"", pour la réalisation de notre pochette d'album (<a href=""http://davidpaulseymour.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://davidpaulseymour.com/</a>). </p>

<p>Nous avons par contre besoin de votre aide pour finaliser le tout! L'enregistrement des chansons maintenant chose faites, nous vous offrons une prévente d'album et de produits dérivés pour finir de financer le projet!</p>
<h3>À quoi servira l'argent?</h3>
<p>Les fonds récoltés dans cette campagne serviront à la mise en marché de l'album, à l'impression de copies physiques sous forme de CD, à finir de payer l'enregistrement, à l'organisation du spectacle de lancement, à l'impression de t-shirt (et autres produits dérivés), à la promotion du band sur les réseaux socios, etc. </p>

We are extremely proud of the result and eager for you to hear it! We were also privileged to have David Paul Seymour, (""The Art of Rock and Roll"") for the album cover artwork.

<p> Hello. </p>
<p>I'm glad you've made it to my page.</p>
<p> I am Vinay Kaushal. I am a composer and guitar player currently based in Pune, India. I mainly write, compose and play music for my collective 'The Vinay Kaushal Collective' and the world music act 'Empty Cafe' among other projects. </p>
<p>I am also an official endorsee for Fender India and Ernie Ball Strings. That has been really great!</p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>I started working on my first album soon after music school and I have composed, mixed and produced this album on my own so far. Many of the songs have been inspired by real events around me including the title track.</p>
<p>Besides me, 11 incredibly talented musicians from around the world have played on this album so far. I have had bass lines recorded and sent to me from as far as Los Angeles and saxophones from England. Some songs were tracked in high end studios, some in smaller home studios and others in living rooms with great acoustics.  I love how it's all sounding.</p>
<h3>How You can Help:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am now at a point where the music for album is nearly ready. But an album needs so much more than simply recording some great music. Here's what all the funds of this campaign are going towards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Studio Costs: </strong>There's some recording left to do and studios cost money!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paying the Musicians: </strong>All the musicians have played on my album gratis! I want to pay them for their efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mastering the Tracks: </strong>The tracks will be mastered by the amazing<a href=""https://www.chrisgrahammastering.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Chris Graham</a> so the album sounds great whether you are listening to it in the car or at home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Album Art: </strong>While one shouldn't judge an album by its cover, I'd still like to have a really cool one made.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Music Videos: </strong>Two of the tracks from my album will have music videos made for them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Copies: </strong>For those of you that are interested, I'd love to have some LPs, CDs and USBs of my album made. Something tangible is always nice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Media Campaign: </strong>I want my music to really get out there. A great way reach the corners of the globe today is through social media promotion.  I will be running a campaign as soon as my tracks are mastered, artwork and videos are completed and the album is ready to be launched!</p></li>

</div></div>","Hello. 
I'm glad you've made it to my page.
 I am Vinay Kaushal. I am a composer and guitar player currently based in Pune, India. I mainly write, compose and play music for my collective 'The Vinay Kaushal Collective' and the world music act 'Empty Cafe' among other projects. 
I am also an official endorsee for Fender India and Ernie Ball Strings. That has been really great!
The Album
I started working on my first album soon after music school and I have composed, mixed and produced this album on my own so far. Many of the songs have been inspired by real events around me including the title track.
Besides me, 11 incredibly talented musicians from around the world have played on this album so far. I have had bass lines recorded and sent to me from as far as Los Angeles and saxophones from England. Some songs were tracked in high end studios, some in smaller home studios and others in living rooms with great acoustics.  I love how it's all sounding.
How You can Help:

I am now at a point where the music for album is nearly ready. But an album needs so much more than simply recording some great music. Here's what all the funds of this campaign are going towards:

Studio Costs: There's some recording left to do and studios cost money!
Paying the Musicians: All the musicians have played on my album gratis! I want to pay them for their efforts.
Mastering the Tracks: The tracks will be mastered by the amazing Chris Graham so the album sounds great whether you are listening to it in the car or at home.
Album Art: While one shouldn't judge an album by its cover, I'd still like to have a really cool one made.
Music Videos: Two of the tracks from my album will have music videos made for them.
Physical Copies: For those of you that are interested, I'd love to have some LPs, CDs and USBs of my album made. Something tangible is always nice.
Social Media Campaign: I want my music to really get out there. A great way reach the corners of the globe today is through social media promotion.  I will be running a campaign as soon as my tracks are mastered, artwork and videos are completed and the album is ready to be launched!
Indiegogo Fees: Yes people, Indiegogo costs money too. 

Give what you can. Like the famous tagline says""Every little helps"". There are some great perks to go with this campaign as well. They're just my way of saying Thank You for all your support, so please don't forget to click ""Get This Perk"" instead of ""Back It"" if you want to claim one.

<h3>More about <i>Pictures at an African Exhibition</i>
</h3>
<p>       Sound Reformation and I have been performing this music for about the past three years with my regular band consisting of Zaccai Curtis on piano, Luques Curtis on bass, Wayne Smith Jr. on the drums, and our special guest Nasheet Waits on the drums.  The project has grown with each time we have performed the music, and we recently documented the music over the course of a year from 2015-2016, first with recording the small group, and then with the wind ensemble.  Finally, each piece of music is accompanied by an original work of art work, done by London based artist David Emmanuel Noel.</p>
<p>       Now in the final phase we are hoping to raise funds  for the mixing, mastering, packaging,  and distribution, as well as promotional and marketing cost.  With certain levels of contributions you will be able to receive some amazing perks such as early copies of the album, signed copies of the album, prints of the art work, and more!   This project is 100% completely independent and while our desired target mark is $6,000, if we do not reach this cost we will still put all contributions towards the completion of this project.  If we are fortunate enough to receive more than our desired cost we will use these funds to promote the album to the best of our ability to make it a success, and if we receive further funding from this campaign it would go towards the budget for recording the second part of this music and arts collaboration.    </p>
<p>     With art programs across the country constantly taking budget cuts and some being removed from the schools, I am hoping this project will be able to come to fruition to serve as an example for younger generations to come as to what is possible if they use their creative powers.  In this project I have drawn inspiration from African art and music, jazz music, classical music, as well as the artwork of David and other visual artists and much more to create this jazz symphony. I am also hopeful that with the themes we've explored in this project we can see that although we all have differences in our various cultures across the world, we all have more in common than we have differences.  </p>
<p>      Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope you will find this project deserving of your support.  Even if you are not able to donate at this time, even spreading the words to friends and family about this project would be most appreciated and hopefully garner more support to bring it to life.  Once again, thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Carys. I've spent the past five years performing, writing and recording in several different bands. I'm the vocalist in avant-garde rock band 'Code Indigo' and symphonic metal cover band 'Lightwish', one half of the duos 'David Wright and Carys', 'Celandine' and 'Freyja's Fire', and a solo performer in my own right.</p>
<p>My next step is to record a solo album of my own original material, which will be called “A Different Kind Of Normal”. If you know me, you'll now be smiling and thinking how appropriate that is, and if you don't know me yet...I have Asperger syndrome and Anxiety disorder, so I have a unique outlook on most things. Let's just say that I'm told life is never dull with me around!</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the album. The plan is to have thirteen tracks, mainly because I really, really like the number thirteen (I was born on Friday the 13th). As for the style of music, well...its me, and I've had a lot of fun trying to get past that description, because I write in a variety of styles depending on my mood. While the track listing isn't finalised yet, the album will begin with the first song I ever wrote back in 2005, the unaccompanied 'Siren Call' (you can hear a snatch in the video at the top of the page) and will include the folk-horror song 'Sir Dominick's Bargain', the Celandine track 'Beating the Streetlights Home (with Rosemary Griffith on vocals) and finish with 'Apocalypse Dreams, which I wrote about the dreams I had whilst on anxiety medication last year. Oh, and there's my death trilogy, which I promise is a lot more fun than it sounds! So if you want to know more about the workings of inside my head, you definitely need this album!</p>
<p>But I need you as well, because without your help I can't create the product I know this album deserves to be. While my studio costs are covered, I still need to pay for the actual glass mastering and CD production, artwork design, promotion... and before that I need to pay the lovely musicians who will be playing alongside me on the album! And that, of course,is where you come in! I've come up with some great rewards that I hope you're going to be interested in, from as basic and sensible as an album download to getting your name in the sleeve notes or me knitting you a scarf! I'll even come and sing at your house for you and your friends!</p>
<p>Even if you aren't able to help fund the album right now, I'd be very grateful if you would please share this link far and wide and tell your friends so as many people as possible get to see it. I'm really passionate about this project and I know with your help we can create an album to be proud of! Thank you.</p>
<p>And a huge thank you to everyone who's helped me so far...</p>

<h3>The Story of ""MANA"":<br/>
</h3>
<p>While we were on tour in January of 2011, we had a last minute show cancellation and ended up playing a DIY house show in rural Pennsylvania.  We met a couple kids who came to see us play after finding out about us through myspace. It turns out they were DJ's at a nearby radio station and invited us to play a live set on-air the next day. At the station we met some truly wonderful human beings who would soon become the production team for our first full length album, ""MANA"". </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- WXLV studio owner and Emmy Award-winning sound designer Harry Snodgrass enthusiastically agreed to act as producer for the album. He designed sound for Napoleon Dynamite, Alien 3, South Park and hundreds of other projects. FUN FACT: he made the ""DUN DUN"" sound in Law and Order! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- Benjamin Fenstermaker, the enormously talented visual artist who designed the album artwork seen above.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- Vince Dejesus, Erich Hamill, Jared Gibson and a slew of other students who would spend hundreds of hours editing, mixing and tinkering with gigantic session files in Pro Tools... All while juggling a full load of college classes, part-time jobs and creative projects of their own.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""MANA"" is an album created and built on the generosity and creativity of numerous people brought together by what seemed like coincidence, but has proven itself to be much more.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where We Are Now:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Almost a year later we are in the final stages of completing this album! After spending 8 months of late nights in the studio and even longer road trips from Baltimore, MD to Allentown, PA, we handed off our mixes to the enormously talented mixing engineer Kevin Bernsten at Developing Nations Studio. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After completing mixes, the album will be sent to an equally talented engineer - Carl Saff of Chicago - to be mastered for both vinyl and CD/digital release in March 2012.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Altogether, that's over ONE YEAR spent working on SEVEN SONGS. Needless to say, we have poured our BLOOD, SWEAT and TEARS into this project and need your help to finish it off.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP and WHY THIS PROJECT IS SPECIAL:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Quite simply, we have reached the end of our ropes financially. As two recent college graduates who made the decision to be full-time musicians in addition to our day jobs, we have an extremely limited amount of money we can use on the project at a time. Up until this point, we have funded every step of the album's production ourselves and simply cannot finish it without the help of outside supporters like YOU!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project is so special because it would have never materialized if it weren't for the kindness, dedication and hard work of complete strangers who eventually became close friends. That idea is what brought us to the album title ""MANA"" which is a polynesian word that means spiritual energy or power that resides in the essence of particularly vibrant, life-affirming individuals. We think this record is brimming with mana. And to push forward in this idea of community, altruism and interconnectivity, we are asking for complete strangers like YOU to help us finish this project and give it the due process it deserves.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need your help to not only pay for the remaining costs of the record's production (i.e. mixing, mastering, printing, etc.), but also to HELP US FUND OUR NATIONAL TOUR TO THE SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST (SXSW) FESTIVAL IN AUSTIN, TEXAS THIS MARCH! The opportunity to play at SXSW is a huge achievement for this band and we are passionate about showing this album to as many people as possible. Simply put, we can't even afford to finish paying off this album without outside assistance, nevermind pay for all the costs of touring - renting a van, gas, etc. That's where your help comes in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are extremely frugal individuals. We sleep in vans. We eat Ramen Noodles in industrial amounts. Bottom line - the $5,000 we are asking for will go towards paying for the absolute essentials of this album and tour - NO FRILLS, NO LUXURIES, NO WASTE. We are here to make music and spread love to others, not to be comfortable or live a life of egotism.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Bottom Line:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We need your help to finish this record and then show it to the world on a tour halfway across the country to debut it at South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin TX, one of the nation's biggest music conferences! Please donate whatever you can, anything helps!</p>
<p><br/></p>

Studying the piano from the age of 7 through to University level and performing on radio, television, to corporate gigs and audiences of thousands, she was encouraged to record her own music. In 2007 she self funded an album of 12 original songs called ""WAITING"". Samples of the 12 songs from her first album can be heard here : <span style=""font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXbzJK25ID4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXbzJK25ID4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a</a></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> As they say ~ once bitten, but definitely not so shy, through the success of her first album, Lori had caught the ""recording bug"" and wanted to record another album. She joined the crowd sourcing site at <a href=""https://www.sellaband.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.sellaband.com/</a> and raised $50,000 through the help of 412 amazing fans from all corners of the world and is now in the process of completing her soon-to-be released album of 13 original tracks called ""No Ordinary Girl."" The release date is anticipated to be September, 2013.</p>

<br/>The album is currently still in the editing phase and Lori looks forward to it's release in 2013. She is now looking to raise funds to record a new music video for the first single off the album.<br/><br/><p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<br/>Lori's goal is to raise a budget of $5,500 for the filming of a professional music video which will help in the promotion of the song for use in every possible avenue to reach a greater audience. This budget will cover all aspects of the filming to the completion of the video. If only part of the goal is reached, she will add funds to complete the video and all contributors will still be rewarded with their perks. If per chance, she raises well over this amount (fingers crossed) the money will go towards promotion of the album and video with the possibility to record a second video.<br/><br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>This is an opportunity for you to help an Indie Artist reach another dream.

 Love of Children (FLOC) is a volunteer group that raises funds to 
provide enrichment and educational support for the neglected, abused, 
and foster care children of our greater Dayton area. The organization 
has worked with a population of approximately 6000 children in our 
community. The current reality of statistics regarding this population 
is frightening. 70% of our inner city youth cannot pass the mandatory 
OGT (Ohio Grad<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">uate
 Test). Of that 70%, it is estimated that 80% of those children become 
our homeless. We are really working with a three tiered population- 
children who are abused or neglected, or in foster care, (one), the 
emancipated youth who have little to no support (two) and eventually, 
the homeless (three). When our current board assembled four years ago, 
the youth in the first category were subsidized through our government 
by a yearly allotment of $2500; we came into a very damaged, shattered 
system. In the past four years, FLOC has been very actively fundraising;
 our efforts have collected over $170,000 for our kids. Because we are a
 full-fledged volunteer agency with no paid staff, we have been able to 
donate these funds on a 100% basis. Any interest in volunteering with 
our organization will be immediately recognized with great appreciation.<br/><br/>The
 afternoon activities include outdoor games and events beginning with 
the incredible DJ Fatty Lumpkin (Status Flo/Skratchmatik) on the 1's and
 2's playing music for your enjoyment, followed by live acoustic and 
music performances by Skilless Villains, Matter of Chance, and Stephanie
 Westfall. Next, for extra flavor, an extensive and talented lineup of 
local comedians will share their talents for some much needed comic 
relief. <br/><br/>The list of comedians is as follows<br/><br/>Jovan Runyon<br/>Carla Brittain<br/>Steve Mac<br/>Jeremy Johnson<br/>Drew Donisi<br/><br/>Mike Etienne<br/>Daren Christian<br/>Lori Graves<br/>Andre Clark<br/>Nate Washington<br/>Kenny Carpenter<br/>And Emcee Adrian Cosby<br/><br/>Last

information. Families and kids of all ages are welcome. There will be

<p>The main purpose of this instructional DVD will be to show how to develop the grooves and fills in all popular styles, while exploring the differences that make them unique!</p>
<p><strong>What inspired this project?</strong></p>
<p>I love playing in all styles of music, and I wanted to share that knowledge with others. I felt the best the medium to do this in was an instructional DVD.  My hope is that I will inspire other drummers to explore other genres, and eventually, help them further their own music careers.</p>
<p><strong>My story:</strong></p>
<p>I grew up in Greece, and since the age of 12, I've had a dream to become one of the best drummers in the world. I've been playing professionally in a variety of genres and with many different types of musicians and artists for over 12 years. Now, I'm attending Berklee College of Music on a scholarship, and continuing to play and tour with professionals such as Mario Frangoulis, my band Sunburst, and other artists in the Boston area. </p>
