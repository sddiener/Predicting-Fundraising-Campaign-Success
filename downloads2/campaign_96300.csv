<p><strong>And these are just examples of possible use of SoKreate ... there is no limit to creativity ... with SoKreate.com!  </strong></p>

<p>As a ""fan"" you'll have your own board, but you, in your turn, may participate in contests like <strong>Mr. or Miss SoKreate</strong>.</p>

<p>Do you want to join in the constitution of the next generation social network, a social network where you finally<span> become the protagonist?</span></p>
<p>Social networks today allow sharing of moods, moments, experiences… </p>
<p><span><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></span></p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>There is who is active and who is a passive reader. But if more than this, a social network allows you to enhance, integrate, suggest what one wants to share with others? </span><span>
<p>SoKreate is this, a platform where everyone can make the best thought, the idea, the art of everyone and thanks to the contribution of<span> all make it perfect.</span></p>
<p>Internet, globalization, social networks have given us a great power that we are using for fun… and this will not change…but having fun, we can improve the world and why not, also have a gain. <span>It 's great to think that a social network can really <em>unite people and nations which are located from opposite sides of the world giving a common purpose.</em></span></p>
<p>Forget humanity at the service of social networks, <em>Sokreate is the social network at the service of humanity</em>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But to do this we need your help.</p>
<p>We are working on this project since two years and we intend to release SoKreate.com in about 10 months, from the moment the campaign will end.</p>
<p>The figure that we estimated as a minimum to allow SoKreate to see the light and support it for at least one year, so that it can then stand on its own feet, is E. 1,925,000 (about $ 2,650,000).</p>
<p>The budget is broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>E. 450.000 (around $ 615,000) are needed for software development </li>
<li>E. 300.000 (around $ 410,000) are needed to support business costs (administrative, commercial, logistics) during the development of software (10 months)</li>
<li>E. 150.000 (around <span>$ 205,000) are needed for the technical management of the website and technical support, during the first year of life</span>
</li>
<li><span>E. 200.000 (around $ 275,000 ) are needed to ensure quality and compliance during the first year of life</span></li>
<li>E. 400,000 (around $ 550,000) are needed to support business costs (administrative, commercial, logistics) during the first year of life</li>
<li>E. 425,000 (around $ 590,000) are needed for taxes (e.g. VAT etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So we ask you for a contribution, huge or little, we will be happy to accept it ... and to thank you the best way we can.</p>
<p>For one euro, you will receive a deep thanks by the founders of SoKreate.com for supporting an initiative that will go down in history.</p>
<p>Per 10 Eur (around $14), you'll have a cute mouse pad with the logo of SoKreate.com. To navigate every day in freedom on SoKreate.com!</p>
<p>For 15 Eur (around $ 20) you will receive an elegant ballpoint pen with SoKreate.com logo, with which you can write your first novel ... and why not .... see it at the top of the SoKreate charts!</p>
<p>For 18 Eur (around $ 25), you will receive a cotton T-shirt of your measurement, branded with the logo of SoKreate.com ... and you may boast to wear a preview of the first fashion product come out of SoKreate!</p>
<p>For 37 Eur (around $ 50) you will have the opportunity to show off the pendant with the logo of SoKreate.com, complete with chain, all in hypoallergenic material. Very chic, very fashion!</p>
<p>For 500 Eur (around prox $ 700), you'll have all to yourself, dear musicians, a beautiful acoustic guitar branded SoKreate.com ... to compose your first ""social"" song ....</p>
<p>For 5,000 Eur (around $ 6,850) your company could publish an advertisement (banner) on SoKreate.com, <strong>visible in every country of the world</strong>, for one day and you’ll get a discount if you get an ad for three days or one week.</p>
<p>Every item you will receive will be shipped directly to your home at no additional charge (in the EU). And with it you will also receive the beautiful SoKreate.com stickers.</p>

<p><em><strong>Lastly, we consider that this initiative will enable millions of people to have a window, which enhances their creativity through the power of the ""social"" mechanisms.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We believe this will soon allow you to have products of great quality and great appeal, now in the fields of music, literature, photography, comics, cooking, videos, design … but then this mechanism will be easily replicable in other areas where the contribution of many people brings the work of the individual, according to the Magic Formula 1+1=3.</strong></em></p>

As a photographer, you can create with other fellow adventurers or just alone photo albums with the same mechanism explained
As a novelist, you can post the story or the first chapter of a novel, or a screenplay, and let others to complete your vision! Or directly upload a complete novel!
As an amateur video, you can post your videos, maybe using as soundtracks songs created by other users!
As a cartoonist, you can collaborate in the creation of comic strips ... or invent a character, the first scenes of a story and let your creature come to life thanks to other SoKreate friends
As a fashion or jewelry designer you can invent models and compose with other users or alone entire collections!
As an inventor, you can submit an idea, even in draft form, and let others perfect and make it feasible for you
As a chef, you can post recipes and see your ideas used as bases for thousands refined courses...The most fascinating, interesting and funniest creations will be voted on by your fans.
The produced material will initially be owned by SoKreate.com, but every composer of the ""social"" opera can take part in competitions and the best ones will work with our partners and have back their deserved royalties.
And these are just examples of possible use of SoKreate ... there is no limit to creativity ... with SoKreate.com!  
But SoKreate.com will also be a ""normal"" multilingual social network.
So you can just be a spectator, chat, post photos, videos, and vote ... of course ... the works of others, directly through your SoKreate account or through the most popular social networks.
As a ""fan"" you'll have your own board, but you, in your turn, may participate in contests like Mr. or Miss SoKreate.
And of course you can create a ""fan page"" of your preferred artist.
And…last but not least…access to all works posted, such as listening to the music 
created through the SoKreate.com webradio or reading posted e-books.
All this also means an Android, BB, iOS or Windows Phone app.  
Do you want to join in the constitution of the next generation social network, a social network where you finally become the protagonist?
Social networks today allow sharing of moods, moments, experiences… 
There is who is active and who is a passive reader. But if more than this, a social network allows you to enhance, integrate, suggest what one wants to share with others? 
SoKreate is this, a platform where everyone can make the best thought, the idea, the art of everyone and thanks to the contribution of all make it perfect.
Internet, globalization, social networks have given us a great power that we are using for fun… and this will not change…but having fun, we can improve the world and why not, also have a gain. It 's great to think that a social network can really unite people and nations which are located from opposite sides of the world giving a common purpose.
Forget humanity at the service of social networks, Sokreate is the social network at the service of humanity.  
 
But to do this we need your help.
We are working on this project since two years and we intend to release SoKreate.com in about 10 months, from the moment the campaign will end.
The figure that we estimated as a minimum to allow SoKreate to see the light and support it for at least one year, so that it can then stand on its own feet, is E. 1,925,000 (about $ 2,650,000).
The budget is broken down as follows:

E. 450.000 (around $ 615,000) are needed for software development 
E. 300.000 (around $ 410,000) are needed to support business costs (administrative, commercial, logistics) during the development of software (10 months)
E. 150.000 (around $ 205,000) are needed for the technical management of the website and technical support, during the first year of life

E. 200.000 (around $ 275,000 ) are needed to ensure quality and compliance during the first year of life
E. 400,000 (around $ 550,000) are needed to support business costs (administrative, commercial, logistics) during the first year of life
E. 425,000 (around $ 590,000) are needed for taxes (e.g. VAT etc.)

So we ask you for a contribution, huge or little, we will be happy to accept it ... and to thank you the best way we can.
For one euro, you will receive a deep thanks by the founders of SoKreate.com for supporting an initiative that will go down in history.
Per 10 Eur (around $14), you'll have a cute mouse pad with the logo of SoKreate.com. To navigate every day in freedom on SoKreate.com!
For 15 Eur (around $ 20) you will receive an elegant ballpoint pen with SoKreate.com logo, with which you can write your first novel ... and why not .... see it at the top of the SoKreate charts!
For 18 Eur (around $ 25), you will receive a cotton T-shirt of your measurement, branded with the logo of SoKreate.com ... and you may boast to wear a preview of the first fashion product come out of SoKreate!
For 37 Eur (around $ 50) you will have the opportunity to show off the pendant with the logo of SoKreate.com, complete with chain, all in hypoallergenic material. Very chic, very fashion!
For 500 Eur (around prox $ 700), you'll have all to yourself, dear musicians, a beautiful acoustic guitar branded SoKreate.com ... to compose your first ""social"" song ....
For 5,000 Eur (around $ 6,850) your company could publish an advertisement (banner) on SoKreate.com, visible in every country of the world, for one day and you’ll get a discount if you get an ad for three days or one week.
Every item you will receive will be shipped directly to your home at no additional charge (in the EU). And with it you will also receive the beautiful SoKreate.com stickers.
You will have the option to pay through Paypal: and for any information related to the payment or delivery of your perk, you may contact the address support@sokreate.com.
And if you can not contribute in any way, you always have the opportunity to share this campaign with your preferred social networks friends .... we we will be deeply grateful!

Lastly, we consider that this initiative will enable millions of people to have a window, which enhances their creativity through the power of the ""social"" mechanisms.
We believe this will soon allow you to have products of great quality and great appeal, now in the fields of music, literature, photography, comics, cooking, videos, design … but then this mechanism will be easily replicable in other areas where the contribution of many people brings the work of the individual, according to the Magic Formula 1+1=3.
So, in order to reach the campaign goal, we offer for E. 1,900,000 (approx $ 2,640,000) the acquisition, for one year, of the commercial rights for all or part of the material produced through SoKreate.

Our sophisticated software achieves exceptional results when scanning jewelry. This technology does not require expensive projectors and cameras. Thanks to mathematics and highly refined algorithms, jewelers can get a 3D model that meets their demanding requirements for precision. The D3D-s scanner is suitable for both self-employed jewelers and professional teams with experience using super expensive scanners. Kickstarter empowered FormLabs to revolutionize 3D printing. Now Kickstarter will help us revolutionize 3D scanning for jewelers!</p><h3> </h3><h3>6 degrees of freedom </h3><p>You'll face challenges when scanning with projection technology. Complex objects will require you to repeatedly reposition the model and be fully engaged in the scanning process. We've solved this problem. The D3D-s was designed to not require repositioning, so all you have to do is place the object on the table and start scanning. Thanks to its 6 degrees of freedom, the scanner can access any part of the model. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIKq3TjhCOY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3> </h3><h3>Retina resolution</h3><p>In 3D scanning, accuracy that allows details to be discerned is paramount. For example, if some scanner has a scan area that is 90х80х55 mm and a 1.3 MP camera, then the width resolution will be 0.070 mm (90 mm/1280 pixels), and the height resolution will be 0.053 mm (55 mm/1024 pixels). You're unlikely to get an accurate model with parameters like that. We've solved this problem too! The vertical accuracy of the D3D-s reaches 0.010 mm, and the horizontal accuracy is up to 0.015 mm. Our projector's step resolution is 0.000625 millimeters. That's more than 84 times the resolution of projection scanners. We even had to limit the maximum resolution in order to get you a finished result within 7 minutes. These specifications are significantly superior to all other existing scanners! This is possible because of the 5 MP camera and high-quality lens. By the way, the lens is very important if you value quality. Such lenses are used to inspect products in machine vision applications at factories. The camera's high resolution is also important for creating high-quality textures. Thus, the D3D-s is the world's most accurate jewelers’ scanner. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567766103/dicf1vqpectgsbxbxfyj.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Scanning examples  </h3><p>This is a model of a ring scanned with maximum precision.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fmodels%2F3430649df10c4adc84ae696fe57c5d38%2Fembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fmodels%2F73b9e9a591694f66aab6d8c3b2690ae7%2Fembed&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fd35krx4ujqgbcr.cloudfront.net%2Furls%2F3430649df10c4adc84ae696fe57c5d38%2Fthumbnails%2F276c6dd182954198a4d87048c731c6c3%2F448.jpeg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=sketchfab""></iframe></div><br/> <p></p><p>This is a model is an inexpensive brooch scanned in quick mode.

The four-layer circuit board distributes heat efficiently. Each part was selected for its high speed and accuracy. The electric motor is controlled by a L6472PD microcontroller. This lets us accelerate and slow the motor smoothly, and it supports other very powerful functions.

Only a few parts, such as the projector, mount, etc., are manufactured to order in small batches. Thus, we don't have to make a huge batch of scanners. This significantly reduces our costs and investments. </p><h3>3D scanning</h3><p>This demo shows scanning in quick mode. You can choose the mode that's right for you based on the complexity of the model and the required scan quality.  </p><div><div>

<p> </p>
</div></div><h3>Combining two scanned models</h3><p>Jewelers unfamiliar with 3D scanners often wonder how to remove the clips that hold the model. The answer is very simple — scan the model twice with the clips in different places. Then use special software, such as MeshLab (a free open-source program) to combine the models and remove anything undesired. In this video, you can see how to do this in a few clicks. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8q_xGyAUoY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Replacing models on the platform</h3><p>Our model platform attaches to the scanner with magnets. This means you can use different platforms. We also made sure that the models were easy to change. Take a look at how easy it is to attach any model.</p><div>

But many of them require expensive mass production. For example, a polycarbonate case that protects the scanner from dust requires the manufacture of a mold. Help us raise more money for this project and you'll receive a protective case, scanning spray, and a larger set of clips for attaching various objects. Tell everyone about us on forums. Show your friends! Together we can do more!</p><h3>How did this project get started?</h3><p>A year ago, we successfully completed a Kickstarter project to create a super-accurate desktop scanner. Since then, we started receiving requests from jewelers and dentists to make a scanner tailored to their needs. In creating our desktop scanner, we set out to achieve a resolution that would let us scan a coin. As a result, adapting the scanner to jewelers' needs was not a problem. We added another axis of rotation and reduced the size of the scanner. We also updated the optics and camera, since jewelers don't need color scanning. We also installed high-precision motors. Taken together, these changes significantly increased the accuracy of an already high-precise scanner. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567607239/ugqcf7elwnmlcxgbrqmr.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567607255/nmoncwokvgj9w2wjfovk.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567607271/kkiilntowdfwegvmpqjz.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567607297/givyr0gskvg4hognnavd.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567607312/n3bv1csw3soerummpsrm.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Who are we?</h3><p>Leonid Nazarenko began his career at the Antonov Plant, which built the An-225, the world's largest airplane.

For us, Kickstarter is only the first step, a springboard for mass production of the world's most accurate scanners.</p></div>","D3D-s: 3D jewelry scannerOur D3D-s scanner takes advantage of LED-line technology, combining incredible accuracy and a price you can afford. Our sophisticated software achieves exceptional results when scanning jewelry. This technology does not require expensive projectors and cameras. Thanks to mathematics and highly refined algorithms, jewelers can get a 3D model that meets their demanding requirements for precision. The D3D-s scanner is suitable for both self-employed jewelers and professional teams with experience using super expensive scanners. Kickstarter empowered FormLabs to revolutionize 3D printing. Now Kickstarter will help us revolutionize 3D scanning for jewelers! 6 degrees of freedom You'll face challenges when scanning with projection technology. Complex objects will require you to repeatedly reposition the model and be fully engaged in the scanning process. We've solved this problem. The D3D-s was designed to not require repositioning, so all you have to do is place the object on the table and start scanning. Thanks to its 6 degrees of freedom, the scanner can access any part of the model.  Retina resolutionIn 3D scanning, accuracy that allows details to be discerned is paramount. For example, if some scanner has a scan area that is 90х80х55 mm and a 1.3 MP camera, then the width resolution will be 0.070 mm (90 mm/1280 pixels), and the height resolution will be 0.053 mm (55 mm/1024 pixels). You're unlikely to get an accurate model with parameters like that. We've solved this problem too! The vertical accuracy of the D3D-s reaches 0.010 mm, and the horizontal accuracy is up to 0.015 mm. Our projector's step resolution is 0.000625 millimeters. That's more than 84 times the resolution of projection scanners. We even had to limit the maximum resolution in order to get you a finished result within 7 minutes. These specifications are significantly superior to all other existing scanners! This is possible because of the 5 MP camera and high-quality lens. By the way, the lens is very important if you value quality. Such lenses are used to inspect products in machine vision applications at factories. The camera's high resolution is also important for creating high-quality textures. Thus, the D3D-s is the world's most accurate jewelers’ scanner.  Scanning examples  This is a model of a ring scanned with maximum precision. This is a model is an inexpensive brooch scanned in quick mode. Note the complexity of the model. It's difficult to scan this many crystals if the scanner has less than 5 degrees of freedom in its movement. This signet ring is old and curved. It has a complex shape. But none of this is a problem for the D3D-s. It accurately reproduces all the flaws of the original model. The  D3D-s scanner has no trouble producing a 3D model of an ancient mantra engraved in stone.The large scanning area lets you scan more than just jewelry. Before you buy a scanner, ask the seller to scan a 2 euro coins with radial lines. This will make everything clear immediately. Here are two models. One was scanned with a very expensive 3D projection scanner. The other — with the D3D-s scanner for jewelers. Walnut  Comparison chart 1) This information is not indicated in official documentation.

 EMBARGOED AND SANCTIONED COUNTRIES We restrict exports to certain destinations: Crimea - Region of Ukraine, Russia, Venezuela, People's Republic of China, Iraq, North Korea, Balkans, Belarus, Central African Republic, Congo, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Zimbabwe, Cuba, Iran, Cyprus, Vietnam. ElectronicsWe're proud of the electronics we developed specifically for this scanner. The four-layer circuit board distributes heat efficiently. Each part was selected for its high speed and accuracy. The electric motor is controlled by a L6472PD microcontroller. This lets us accelerate and slow the motor smoothly, and it supports other very powerful functions. It's so awesome that we can't sell it in Russia, since it can be used to make rockets. SoftwareWe developed software specifically for the D3D-s with lots of unique features. The software is currently available for Windows 7/8/10. Once the scanning is done, you'll get an STL file that you can open in any program that supports STL files, such as ZBRUSH, RhinoGold, MatrixGold,  Jewelery cad dream and more.How did we make the D3D-s affordable? The scanner is made of parts that are used in 3D printers and can be purchased one piece at a time. Only a few parts, such as the projector, mount, etc., are manufactured to order in small batches. Thus, we don't have to make a huge batch of scanners. This significantly reduces our costs and investments. 3D scanningThis demo shows scanning in quick mode. You can choose the mode that's right for you based on the complexity of the model and the required scan quality.  

 
Combining two scanned modelsJewelers unfamiliar with 3D scanners often wonder how to remove the clips that hold the model. The answer is very simple — scan the model twice with the clips in different places. Then use special software, such as MeshLab (a free open-source program) to combine the models and remove anything undesired. In this video, you can see how to do this in a few clicks.  Replacing models on the platformOur model platform attaches to the scanner with magnets. This means you can use different platforms. We also made sure that the models were easy to change. Take a look at how easy it is to attach any model.

 
LED-line technologyCompared to laser sources, the light projector ensures more uniform illumination in addition to sharp edges and no speckle effect. RewardsWe want to give you a lot of different extras. But many of them require expensive mass production. For example, a polycarbonate case that protects the scanner from dust requires the manufacture of a mold. Help us raise more money for this project and you'll receive a protective case, scanning spray, and a larger set of clips for attaching various objects. Tell everyone about us on forums. Show your friends! Together we can do more!How did this project get started?A year ago, we successfully completed a Kickstarter project to create a super-accurate desktop scanner. Since then, we started receiving requests from jewelers and dentists to make a scanner tailored to their needs. In creating our desktop scanner, we set out to achieve a resolution that would let us scan a coin. As a result, adapting the scanner to jewelers' needs was not a problem. We added another axis of rotation and reduced the size of the scanner. We also updated the optics and camera, since jewelers don't need color scanning. We also installed high-precision motors. Taken together, these changes significantly increased the accuracy of an already high-precise scanner.  Who are we?Leonid Nazarenko began his career at the Antonov Plant, which built the An-225, the world's largest airplane. Since childhood, Leonid has created model planes, and then taught schoolchildren to do the same. He enjoys radio-controlled model planes and has won RC helicopter competitions. He has a deep understanding of metalworking and a wide range of engineering disciplines. He passed his meticulousness and love of accuracy on to his son. Denys Nazarenko has won various competitions in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Denys developed the well-known Start Menu X, which has delighted users around the world with a convenient alternative to the Windows start menu for more than 10 years. btw. This is a real plasma gun but with limited distance :( Risks and challengesWe've learned a lot from the process of producing our desktop scanners, which began with just an idea and ended with packaging and delivering finished products to end customers. Of course, our first attempt involved a lot of imperfections, and we delayed deliveries for several months. This was due to our inexperience and small budget.

<h2>Check the Gallery Tab for a Demo Video of the BladeKey!</h2>
<p>-------------</p>
<h2>Finally, a Pocket Tool Made to Fit Your Life!</h2>
</div>
<p>BladeKey was inspired by the lack of affordable and effective ways to comfortably carry standard metal keys in a pocket.  I found keys to be uncomfortable, noisy, and that they would easily get disorganized.  Furthermore, many keychain pocket tools are seemingly not designed to be comfortable in a pant pocket, and contain many different unneeded tools or too few tools. I knew there had to be a better way to carry keys and pocket tools.</p>
<p>The BladeKey is also a platform that users can customize to build their own pocket tool, that includes standard metal keys--without modification.  There are many one-off DIY solutions that require the destruction of a standard pocket tool.  These DIY solutions require a substantial amount of effort and modification to both keys and tools.  This makes it difficult to impelment these solutions because it may be hard to find the right tool or correctly modify existing keys and tools.  BladeKey attempts to solve this problem once and for all by providing a customizable platform that does not require modification of keys or tools.</p>
<p>With your support, an all metal version of the BladeKey will become a relality.    The factory has produced a high quality first batch, and is ready to produce as many as needed.  They just need to know how many to make in what colors and sizes!</p>
<p>As a supporter, you will get to vote on the colors that BladeKey will be manufactured in.  Furthermore, backers can also pre-order BladeKey devices at a discount to the anticipated retail price.</p>
<h2>About BladeKey™ DIY Modular Pocket Tool and Key Organizer   </h2>

</div>
<p>BladeKey was created to be as minimalist and utilitarian as possible, and to solve specific problems that everyone encounters carrying keys.  Keys can be bulky, become disorganized, or become tangled with other objects.</p>
<p>BladeKey keeps the sharp parts of keys away from flesh, and itself contains no sharp edges. Additionally, the BladeKey keeps keys in order and eliminates any jingling of keys, while the design remains minimal so that there is not a great deal of bulk added to the keys. </p>
<p>To hold the keys in, the BladeKey uses a single zip-tie. A zip-tie was chosen over other fasteners for several reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>Zip-ties are ubiquitous, and strong. </li>
<li>Zip-ties do not become too loose or too tight when keys are rotated (like a screw or Chicago Binding Post does).</li>
<li>Zip-ties are easy to insert and remove (as compared to pop-rivets).</li>
<li>A zip-tie works regardless of the width of any particular BladeKey device. </li>
<li>A zip-tie applies pressure to the heads of the keys thereby applying constant friction that keeps the keys in place whether stored or deployed for use.</li>
<li>If keys need to be occasionally removed, it is easy to snip a portion of the zip-tie, reconfigure the keys, and install a new zip-tie. </li>
</ul><p>Using the BladeKey is easy. The key that is needed is simply rotated out from the device.  The other keys can remain stored in the BladeKey.  The deployed key is held in place with friction.</p>

<h2>History of BladeKey</h2>
<p>BladeKey has been a hobby of mine for some time.  It started as a little project in 2005.  The original version was quite bulky and was composed of many pieces that were held together with bolts.  The bolts would work themsleves loose over time.</p>
<p>In 2009, my efforts were reinvigorated when I purchased a 3D printer.  With the 3D printer it was easier to prototype numerous different concepts.</p>
<p><img alt=""BladeKey Prototypes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://g.virbcdn.com/_f/files/87/FileItem-273375-1IMG_1708.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""BladeKey Prototypes""/></p>
<p><em>Timeline of BladeKey Prototypes</em></p>
<p>After producing several plastic versions, people started asking me if I was ever going to produce the BladeKey in aluminium.  While the plastic worked well, the quality depended largely on the particular 3D printer used to make each BladeKey device.  Furthermore, the look and feel of ABS plastic simply does not compare to high quality aluminium.</p>
<p>After selling many BladeKey devices in all shapes and sizes on Shapeways, I had the data I needed to determine the most optimal sizes to manufacture an aluminium version of the BladeKey.</p>
<p>With your support, the aluminium production version of the BladeKey will become a reality.</p>
<h3>Aluminium BladeKey Sizes</h3>
<p>If our funding goal is reached, the BladeKey will be manufactured in three different sizes.  All of the money will go to covering the costs of production and shipping.  In addition the three different sizes will come in Black, Silver, and other colors that backers will get to vote on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BladeKey N3 - Up to 3 Standard Metal Keys.</strong> The BladeKey N3 can accommodate any number of keys measuring at most 6.5 mm wide x 57 mm long.  In addition to zip ties, spacers are included to ensure a proper fit for people with less than three keys.</li>
<li>
<strong>BladeKey N6 - Up to 6 Standard Metal Keys.</strong> The BladeKey N6 can accommodate any number of keys measuring at most 12.5 mm wide x 57 (on each side) to ~63 mm (in the middle).  In addition to zip ties, spacers are included to ensure a proper fit for people with 4 or 5 keys.</li>
<li>
<strong>BladeKey N9 - Up to 9 Standard Metal Keys.</strong> The BladeKey N9 can accommodate any number of keys measuring at most 19 mm wide x 57 (on each side) to ~66 mm (in the middle).  In addition to zip ties, spacers are included to ensure a proper fit for people with 7 or 8 keys.</li>

Finally, a Pocket Tool Made to Fit Your Life!

BladeKey was inspired by the lack of affordable and effective ways to comfortably carry standard metal keys in a pocket.  I found keys to be uncomfortable, noisy, and that they would easily get disorganized.  Furthermore, many keychain pocket tools are seemingly not designed to be comfortable in a pant pocket, and contain many different unneeded tools or too few tools. I knew there had to be a better way to carry keys and pocket tools.
The BladeKey is also a platform that users can customize to build their own pocket tool, that includes standard metal keys--without modification.  There are many one-off DIY solutions that require the destruction of a standard pocket tool.  These DIY solutions require a substantial amount of effort and modification to both keys and tools.  This makes it difficult to impelment these solutions because it may be hard to find the right tool or correctly modify existing keys and tools.  BladeKey attempts to solve this problem once and for all by providing a customizable platform that does not require modification of keys or tools.
With your support, an all metal version of the BladeKey will become a relality.    The factory has produced a high quality first batch, and is ready to produce as many as needed.  They just need to know how many to make in what colors and sizes!
As a supporter, you will get to vote on the colors that BladeKey will be manufactured in.  Furthermore, backers can also pre-order BladeKey devices at a discount to the anticipated retail price.

<p></p>
<p>Cables, cables, cables, and more cables. Nowadays, most people have multiple devices and gadgets that often create a ""cable catastrophe"" on the desk. Personally, I have cables and cords from my laptop, external hard-drive, printer, cellphone, monitor, and, tablet. A couple friends of mine have even more cables. More annoyingly, when I remove the cables from my devices or gadgets, the cables always slide and drop under the table.</p>
<p>I went searching online for solutions, but the cable organizers that I have found can typically hold only 1 or 2 cables at once. To meet my need, I would need to use 3 to 5 cable organizers.<b>This is too wasteful and tedious. </b></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/3-08-2016/wKRPRf.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><p><br/></p>
<p>My friends and I thought to ourselves - ""why don't we design something that can meet our needs? Something that can hold many more cables at once? Something that doesn't have to be wasteful?"" And this is what we have come up with - <b>the 2+3 Cable Organizer. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457407498/e5c73od10scuwj2smfgt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

It is simple, and it works. It can hold up to 5 cables which eliminate the wasteful need to use multiple cable organizers. Each slot diameter is 6.4mm. More importantly, the product is made of environmental-friendly material called Thermoplastic Rubber, and the packaging of the product is made of 100% recyclable plastic.<br/>

Cables, cables, cables, and more cables. Nowadays, most people have multiple devices and gadgets that often create a ""cable catastrophe"" on the desk. Personally, I have cables and cords from my laptop, external hard-drive, printer, cellphone, monitor, and, tablet. A couple friends of mine have even more cables. More annoyingly, when I remove the cables from my devices or gadgets, the cables always slide and drop under the table.
I went searching online for solutions, but the cable organizers that I have found can typically hold only 1 or 2 cables at once. To meet my need, I would need to use 3 to 5 cable organizers.This is too wasteful and tedious. 

My friends and I thought to ourselves - ""why don't we design something that can meet our needs? Something that can hold many more cables at once? Something that doesn't have to be wasteful?"" And this is what we have come up with - the 2+3 Cable Organizer. 



It is simple, and it works. It can hold up to 5 cables which eliminate the wasteful need to use multiple cable organizers. Each slot diameter is 6.4mm. More importantly, the product is made of environmental-friendly material called Thermoplastic Rubber, and the packaging of the product is made of 100% recyclable plastic.


No more cables falling to the ground. 


 It can be used to shorten cables that are too long.



Holds up to 5 cables with up to 6.4mm in diameter. 




The 2+3 Cable Organizer works really well for desktop users who often struggle with many more cables and cords. Very often, the cables and cords come in at various lengths which can be really intimidating to deal with. Since the 2+3 Cable Organizer has multiple slots and can shorten long cables, the task is much simpler.




Having the cables secured on a vertical surface prevents the feet from kicking and disconnecting the cables and cords....especially the power cord.
It also works well for people who like to charge their devices all at once at night before they go to sleep.






Furthermore, not having lots of cables lying on the ground really makes vacuuming much easier. 
Lots and lots of samples were made and tested to ensure this product works.
 We were very selective on the adhesive. After experimenting with lots of adhesive, we decided to use a high quality 3M adhesive that does not leave any residue!



The 2+3 Cable Organizer come in classic black. 



And also three other amazing colours - China red, blue violet, and space grey. 



The 2+3 Cable Organizers will come in a set of 3 and will retail at 9.99 USD later on. 




By supporting our project, you will be able to receive the organizers at a special price (+ a bonus unit!!). Please check out our perks structure below! 




After working with several manufacturers, we have decided that the 2+3 Cable Organizer will be made by a reliable and trustworthy manufacturer located in Taiwan.

<p>Throughout my life, I never really knew what I wanted to do. I would try any and everything, but be good at essentially nothing. In 2016, it felt like I had a mid-life crisis (strange for a teenager, I know), I felt hopeless for the future, all the projects I've tried have failed miserably. After months of feeling sorry for myself, I decided to pick myself up and jump headfirst into self-improvement.</p>
<p>I asked myself the question, ""How did the most successful people get where they are?"" With that guiding question, I started to read. I found a common principle that seemed to be evident in all of the books I've read. It was first in one book. Then two. Then eventually, dozens of books that have stated essentially the same one single concept.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595599978/s9fxhy11irkzdowocr2m.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <p>To get anything you want in life, do something consistently and become 1% better every single time.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, ""that's too simple to be true."" It was until it wasn't. I started implementing this rule in my life, and suddenly everything began to change for me. It was with this one principle that pulled me out of my negative spiral and built up a life of satisfaction, intention, and focus for myself.</p>
<p>Everything that I have ever learned in self-improvement is put into this one journal. With this key concept at the forefront, the Progression Journal was my way of improving myself 1% every single day. It can do the same for you.</p>
<p><strong>With the Progression Journal, every day you write in it, you are becoming one step closer to who you were meant to become.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595600018/rucpym7jpqel5lyxyp7l.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Progression Journal is a physical journal designed to cater to your self-improvement needs.</strong> The sole purpose of the journal is to keep your daily schedule steady with a 1% improvement regularly. </p>
<p>We’ve designed the journal so that you start with the Progress Section, which will help you clarify your life to the main essentials. Then you’ll reverse engineer those goals through the daily, weekly, and monthly sections. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong> Pushes you out of your comfort zone:</strong> Daily challenges that will invoke a sense of change into you after a couple of weeks of completing them. We also have weekly challenges to ensure you learn something new, make a small life change, and help someone else every single week.</li>
<li> <strong>Have a 30,000 feet view on life:</strong> Most of the time, we get bombarded by the small problems, we don’t realize the positives that are in our lives. We have a dedicated monthly and weekly review section to ensure a streamlined focus and push towards your goals.</li>
<li> <strong>Starts your self-improvement journey:</strong> The first 50 pages of the journal are to help prime you for the rest of the three months. This is done through utilizing growth writing exercises to figure out who you are, what you want, and your motivations towards it.</li>
<li> <strong>Helps you become happier:</strong> At the top of every journal entry, we have a daily quote to inspire and motivate you for the day ahead. We have also included gratitude prompts in the morning and for the night journal as well.</li>
<li> <strong>Organizes your life:</strong> Our brains are way better at creating ideas, rather than storing them. We have included notes and reflection portions on each daily, weekly, and monthly entry to ensure you keep a clear head and organized life.</li>
<li> <strong>Creates a sense of self-confidence:</strong> There is something about doing something consistently that makes us look back and feel a sense of pride. At first, you’ll start, it may be a little rocky, but as you go along, you’ll begin to gain confidence in your journaling abilities.</li>
<li> <strong>Saves you time:</strong> There are productivity prompts integrated into each page of the journal. By giving yourself ten minutes of using this journal every day, you save decision fatigue throughout the day. You can never get time back, so why not build a structure with the Progression Journal? </li>

<p> Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to have a pet food/water bowl that only the specified pet could get access to? Since dogs and cats don’t have opposable thumbs (and the toddlers we tested weren’t very cooperative) we’ve come up with a clever way to do this.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Conceptual Drawing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/010/329/9d2fc87448a0fee98f699d2fc16f8a18_large.png?1338474472"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div class=""template asset""><em>Conceptual Drawing</em></div>
<p><strong>How we’re doing it</strong></p>
<p>We have built a proof-of-concept bowl with a lid that opens when a specific pet’s tag is detected and closes when the pet moves away from the bowl. (Yes, you can have a bowl open up to multiple tags so several pets can get access to, say, the water.)</p>
<p>We have developed mechanical design prototypes that proved to be very useful in teaching us ways NOT to make the bowl (note: a loud motor is a) interesting to kids and b) scary to pets). Through testing various motor types, an RFID reader and numerous mechanical configurations we now have several prototypes. (With the help of lots of coffee and doggy treats.)</p>
<p>Here are some nifty features and innovations of the RFID-opening pet bowl:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically opens and closes to a specific pet i.d-type tag, worn on their collar. It’s not just a proximity sensor.</li>
<li>Designed with pet-friendly features (so that your pet will use it).</li>
<li>Human-friendly with a removable bowl for ease of filling and cleaning.</li>
<li>Eco-friendly, made out of recyclable materials/possibly post-consumer plastics.      </li>
<li>The initial bowl design has a 2qt capacity.</li>
<li>Powered by 4-AA batteries or a wall charger.</li>
<li>An RFID range of ~1 ft.</li>
<li>Aiming for a retail price around $100.</li>
<li>Nifty design that looks spiffy in your home. And a great conversation piece—‘cause it’s just so cool.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we need to do next, with your support (aka, help!)</strong></p>
<p>After extensive testing and research, we have three distinct design ideas to be cast or laser sintered and electronics and RFID antennas to be designed and fabricated. We are ready to build prototypes that are fully functional and manufacturable.</p>
<p>After additional prototype testing, a final design will be selected. That final design will become the production model that will be sent off for testing by an outside lab to verify that the bowl complies with FCC regulations for transmitting RF signals.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll be ready to manufacture the problem-solving RFID pet bowl! This includes building the injection molds, the electronic and RFID antenna boards, and assembly and product fulfillment (i.e., when it can show up at your door). Just think, if you’re one of the lucky Indiegogo supporters who invested at that level, you’ll get yours first!</p>
<p><strong>The budget and beyond</strong></p>
<p>The goal we have set for this Indigogo campaign covers the detailed mechanical, electrical and RFID engineering of the pet bowl and pet tag, the prototype manufacturing, testing, and production startup costs.</p>
<p>Our assembled team of mechanical, electrical, software and RF engineers are lined up and ready to go. As are the prototype shop and mold shop. We also have dogs, cats and kids on hand to test the product. (We want to be thorough.) Once we are fully funded in this campaign, we are ready to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal (woot!), we will be able to explore different versions of the bowl and other capabilities, such as:</p>
<p>       --a more cat-friendly sized bowl</p>
<p>       --a double-bowl design</p>
<p>       --a stand/base that can be adjusted for your pet’s height</p>
<p>       --testing for RF signal transmission compliance for Canada and Europe</p>
<p>       --a solar-chargeable adapter</p>

Maybe you have pet friends who come to visit or grandkids, so you only think about this when you’re leaping to remove your pet’s bowl out of range.

An adorable toddler named Jamie. Who has an affinity for dog food and water.
 Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to have a pet food/water bowl that only the specified pet could get access to? Since dogs and cats don’t have opposable thumbs (and the toddlers we tested weren’t very cooperative) we’ve come up with a clever way to do this.

Conceptual Drawing
How we’re doing it
We have built a proof-of-concept bowl with a lid that opens when a specific pet’s tag is detected and closes when the pet moves away from the bowl. (Yes, you can have a bowl open up to multiple tags so several pets can get access to, say, the water.)
We have developed mechanical design prototypes that proved to be very useful in teaching us ways NOT to make the bowl (note: a loud motor is a) interesting to kids and b) scary to pets).

Designed with pet-friendly features (so that your pet will use it).
Human-friendly with a removable bowl for ease of filling and cleaning.
Eco-friendly, made out of recyclable materials/possibly post-consumer plastics.      
The initial bowl design has a 2qt capacity.
Powered by 4-AA batteries or a wall charger.
An RFID range of ~1 ft.
Aiming for a retail price around $100.
Nifty design that looks spiffy in your home. And a great conversation piece—‘cause it’s just so cool.

What we need to do next, with your support (aka, help!)
After extensive testing and research, we have three distinct design ideas to be cast or laser sintered and electronics and RFID antennas to be designed and fabricated. We are ready to build prototypes that are fully functional and manufacturable.

<p>When you are on the road but still need to have fun and get things done, it’s always difficult on a small screen. Gaming on the go just isn't the same as playing games at home in front of the big screen. And carrying around a full-size, high-def monitor that is fast enough for games and work is inconvenient and unpractical. There's no substitute for a small-sized panel designed for gamers to enjoy the best gaming experience on the go as at home.<br/> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>How did the idea come from? </strong><br/> </li></ul>
<p>The most common refresh rate of portable monitors in the market is 60Hz. But the serious gamers need more than a smooth 60 FPS frame rates while playing the racing, first-person shooting, or competitive games. Why there is rarely a portable monitor with a high refresh rate? The main reason is that the high power consumption to maintain the high refresh rate continuously makes it difficult on the portable monitor. Besides, the high manufacturing cost makes it unpractical for the common office uses. We're always looking forward if there is a portable monitor that can bring us the smooth gaming experience on the go just as playing on big screen at home.<br/> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>How was MageDok born?</strong><br/> </li></ul>
<p>The idea of making a portable monitor with a high refresh rate came in our mind last year. After countless nights, we created MageDok, a portable gaming monitor with an incredible refresh rate of 144Hz at an affordable price. The monitor can be driven and powered by the laptop or smartphone with only one USB C cable. We manage to design the unique power and display management that can maintain the high refresh rate in low power consumption. </p>
<p>MageDok is lighter, faster, more vivid, and operates at a high refresh rate to keep game play smooth and images accurate. It’s the ultimate monitor with a more expansive view for work and play. <br/> </p>

</div></div></div>","When you are on the road but still need to have fun and get things done, it’s always difficult on a small screen. Gaming on the go just isn't the same as playing games at home in front of the big screen. And carrying around a full-size, high-def monitor that is fast enough for games and work is inconvenient and unpractical. There's no substitute for a small-sized panel designed for gamers to enjoy the best gaming experience on the go as at home. 

How did the idea come from?  
The most common refresh rate of portable monitors in the market is 60Hz. But the serious gamers need more than a smooth 60 FPS frame rates while playing the racing, first-person shooting, or competitive games. Why there is rarely a portable monitor with a high refresh rate? The main reason is that the high power consumption to maintain the high refresh rate continuously makes it difficult on the portable monitor. Besides, the high manufacturing cost makes it unpractical for the common office uses. We're always looking forward if there is a portable monitor that can bring us the smooth gaming experience on the go just as playing on big screen at home. 

How was MageDok born? 
The idea of making a portable monitor with a high refresh rate came in our mind last year. After countless nights, we created MageDok, a portable gaming monitor with an incredible refresh rate of 144Hz at an affordable price. The monitor can be driven and powered by the laptop or smartphone with only one USB C cable. We manage to design the unique power and display management that can maintain the high refresh rate in low power consumption. 
MageDok is lighter, faster, more vivid, and operates at a high refresh rate to keep game play smooth and images accurate. It’s the ultimate monitor with a more expansive view for work and play.

Compact and Portable 
The small size of MageDok 13 is perfect to pack in your bag and carry around. It is a lightweight and compact work station anytime and anywhere. 
 

Multi-touch Capacitive 
The 10-points multi-touch feature allows you to play mobile games, work on the big screen or type quickly and easily on a virtual keyboard. 

 
 
Plug and Play 
MageDok can be driven and powered by the laptop or smartphone with only one USB C cable. Display your laptop or smartphone’s content simply by plugging. The USB C port supports the data  transfer, the power supply and the reverse charge. MageDok can charge your connected device through the other power supply. 

 

Boost Your Productivity 
An extra screen helps you work more efficiently when you deal with multiple tasks, apps, or documents at the same time. It eliminates task switching and speeds performance and productivity.  
 

Portrait Mode for Better Coding 
Portrait mode gives you the perfect view of documents, books, or mobile websites and lets you perform tasks such as coding in a more practical viewing perspective. 
 
Versatile Connectivity
 
USB-C and micro-HDMI connectivity enable displaying content from a wide range of portable devices such as smartphones, laptops, Nintendo Switch, Play Station, Xbox, Raspberry Pi, and more.

Wir planen, Ladestationen zu installieren, die mit Solarenergie arbeiten. Willst du wissen warum? Erinnern Sie sich an die 7 Milliarden Kilogramm CO2-Emissionen, von denen wir Ihnen erzählt haben? Deswegen!Die Stationen benötigen keine harten Installationen oder Energiequellen. Ziel ist es, die Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien unter den Menschen zu fördern!Um Menschen zu helfen, die Spots schnell zu finden, planen wir eine mobile App zu entwickeln. Innerhalb der App können die Leute die Orte sehen, die am nächsten sind und mit ihrer Hilfe die Richtung dorthin bekommen.Möchten Sie sehen, wie unsere Solar-Ladestationen aussehen? Hier kommt's! Sie werden umweltfreundlich, kostenlos und sehr einfach zu bedienen sein!Wir sind sehr begeistert von diesem Projekt, denn wir werden nicht nur mit einer Stadt aufhören! Deine Stadt wird die nächste sein, und du wirst dein Leben mit uns genießen. :)Was ist unsere Evidenz?Im Rahmen des City-Charge-Projekts haben wir eine kleine Umfrage durchgeführt, um ein vorläufiges Verständnis für das Ausmaß des Bedarfs an Dienstleistungen zu erlangen, die wir anbieten möchten. 69,7% unserer Befragten gaben an, dass sie ihre mobilen Geräte mindestens einmal am Tag aufladen, und nur 9,1% von ihnen gaben an, dass sie immer eine Powerbank haben. 97% unserer Befragten gaben an, dass sie ein Kabelladegerät verwenden. Die große Mehrheit der Befragten (69,7%) gab an, dass sie ihr Telefon einmal am Tag aufladen, während bei einer vollständigen Nutzung des Telefons die einmalige Gebühr nur für 7 Stunden ausreicht. Dies zeigt deutlich, dass das Gerät mindestens einmal am Tag aufgeladen werden muss.Eine große Mehrheit unserer Befragten (~ 70%) äußerte eine positive Einstellung gegenüber Telefon-Ladestationen in Berlin und 93,9% äußerten die Notwendigkeit, ihr Telefon an sicheren öffentlichen Orten aufzuladen. Die am meisten bevorzugten Orte, an denen die Befragten angaben, waren Pubs, Bars, Clubs und Bus- / Bahnhöfe. Warum bist DU der Schlüssel zum Erfolg?Unser gewähltes Modell, um unsere einfachen, aber wichtigen Fragen des täglichen Lebens herauszufordern, kann nur verwirklicht werden, wenn wir gleichgesinnte Menschen haben, die uns unterstützen. Dafür haben wir unsere Vergünstigungen so entwickelt, dass Sie glücklich sind! Du kannst so viel wie möglich beitragen und wenn du mehr willst, möchtest du, dass wir deinen Beitrag der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren, du kannst es tun! Es ist unser Hauptziel: zu zeigen, dass Menschen für Menschen tun! Unser Zeitplan für das Projekt ist folgender: Die Möglichkeiten, wie Sie uns helfen könnenUm dieses Projekt umzusetzen, brauchen wir Ihre Hilfe! Bitte leisten Sie einen Beitrag zu unserer Kampagne auf jedem Niveau, das Sie können. Jeder Beitrag wird sehr geschätzt, und wir werden für Ihre Unterstützung für immer dankbar sein!Bitte TEILEN Sie diese Kampagne (den Indiegogo-Link) mit Ihrer Familie, Freunden, Netzwerk, Kunden, mailen Sie sie, posten Sie sie, tweeten Sie oder sprechen Sie einfach darüber :)",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

                |","Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation",https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-m-emy-your-emotions-scanner/pica
0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>What motivation causes us to start this project?</strong></p>
<p><span>In 2007, Winson was trying to sell computer hardware, software and network devices with his associates on the web. Although he and his associates were engineers, they found building an e-commerce site and all intranet operational applications involved huge amount of money and time. They realized something was wrong therefore they then spent the following 5 years on developing the “Codeless Computing Platform” to facilitate an economical method of rapid application development.</span></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Shred IT expenses, time and effort by 90% + </strong></p>
<p>Have you ever purchased or got quotes from Information Technology solution providers at staggering prices? Have you ever waited for a long time for these application to be ready? Have you ever wondered why computer programs must be done by technical experts? Have you wondered whether this money and time spent is worth your investment?</p>
<p>We have. And therefore, we built a platform that facilitates users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend only $200 per year for applications/infrastructure</li>
<li>Create an application in a day</li>
<li>Develop applications without technical knowledge</li>
<li>Use one ""Company-wide"" database across all applications</li>
</ul><p>Not only do we believe that applications should be created with minimal time, money, expertise and effort, but also, we believe that applications should and can be shared across the globe.</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Current IT issues</strong></p>
<p><em>Staggering Cost</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Why is it so expensive in developing applications? The cost involved are-</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Hardware cost</li>
<li>Software cost</li>
<li>Application Development cost</li>
<li>Maintenance cost including network fees, software maintenance</li>
<li>Future upgrade cost</li>
</ol></ol><p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Just a simple web application like on-line marketing survey or order taking, may cost at least $8,000 to $10,000 already.</p>
<p><em>Long lead-time</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Even if you would like to spend these huge expenses, the lead time is unbearable. It may take 3 to 6 months to develop a simple application. It includes requirement gathering and confirmation, prototyping, programming, testing, installation etc..</p>
<p><em>Programming difficulties</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">What then is the real problem? The ugly truth is software applications started off with “hard-code” in mind. This means that only computer programmers can develop applications. While high-paid computer programmers are expert in programming, they do not know much about your business processes. So, they have to spend time and effort to understand your business process before even drafting anything. You can imagine there is enormous cost.</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>How we drive down cost, time and remove programming barrier: Codeless Computing</strong></p>
<p>Our view is totally different,  ”Applications must be code free.”  Software system should be able to handle all back-end development. Business owners should just handle application development themselves to drive down the cost. (The same analogy happened decades ago, only secretaries typed for the bosses. Now, everybody uses the Word Processor.)</p>
<p>We visualize the system should-</p>
<ul>
<li>Be code free</li>
<li>Have a single interface</li>
<li>Use one database across all applications</li>
<li>Be Zero hardware / software cost</li>
<li>Charge minimal cost</li>
<li>Incur minimal development time</li>
<li>Support multi-language</li>
<li>Be usable by personal computers, mobiles and tablets</li>
</ul><p>Users can develop their applications with simple points and clicks. So, anybody should be able to develop a simple application within a day or two.</p>
<p>Results of deploying canned solutions, eventually you were creating multiple data islands. Imagine you ask two different solution providers to deploy a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and an Account applications, it is highly likely that you have to input data twice by two interfaces. In contrast, BAX assigned only one dedicated database for each company therefore if you develop applications in our BAX platform then you use only one interface, input data once and maintain only one set of data.</p>
<p>BAX is a profile driven programming environment. Users need to fill in the detail of an application profile “form” then a module will be generated accordingly. A lot of pre-built functions are ready to use e.g. Document Audit Trailing, Document Add/Edit controlling etc.  BAX platform is not Independent Development Environment (IDE). It is much simpler than IDE. Better still, it is on the cloud. It means that once an app is developed, it can be used instantly.</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>What we offer</strong></p>
<p><em>Default business applications</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>A platform on Cloud comes with the most commonly used business applications:</em></p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Customer profile</li>
<li>Vendor profile</li>
<li>Sale Lead Management application</li>
<li>Purchase application</li>
<li>Account application</li>
<li>IT Helpdesk</li>
<li>Document Library application</li>
</ul></ul><p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Our platform supports multi-language in all field labels and data. We provide full flexibility for each user who can choose his/her preferred language.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">All of these applications can be customized by changing the application profile settings to meet user requirements. In our current practice, while we are getting user requirements, we can modify the application and show the application final results on the spot. In this way, an application is created already.</p>
<p><em>Application Generator</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We know you want more than our default applications. Our Application Generator allows you to add <em>your</em> own application. We provide all simple Web development interfaces for you to “Do It Yourself” and save cost and money.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">How much savings you can get from developing your own application? Let me give you an example. The most prominent Customer Relationship Management service provider, <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/crm/editions-pricing.jsp?d=70130000000rynQ&amp;internal=true"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">salesforce.com</a> is charging a whopping $250 per user / month for their highest end customizable solution. If there are only 5 users in the company, it costs $15,000 per year. We charge you only $200. That is a 98.67% savings. Remember our system does not confine a user to customize only the CRM application. All BAX applications are 100% customizable.</p>
<p><em>Application Sharing / Selling as a business</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Since applications can be easily developed through our platform, we believe users would like to share / sell their applications.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Can you imagine that you once are spending money on business applications can now earn money from developing applications? You can turn your brilliant business processes into an application and sell to the whole world. “BAX Application Marketplace” allows you to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Please back us up so that you can-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>spend $200 per year for application and infrastructure</li>
<li>create an application in a day</li>
<li>develop applications without technical expertise</li>
<li>share / sell your BAX applications by applying your business know-how</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p>Question: Why do you do this project? What is your vision?</p>
<p>Answer: We believe that computing and automation should not have high cost of entry.  Our vision is Information Technology (1) should be provided at a very affordable cost. It should be at most 10% of the current cost. In the event that only a SME with fewer than 5 persons, 90%+ of the cost can be saved. (2) Development time should be within a day or two. (3) Anybody can do this. (4) Since anybody can develop applications, these applications should be shared / sold easily in web-space.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question: Your project has an interesting name, Business Application Express?</p>
<p>Answer: Our vision is to facilitate Codeless Computing Platform to develop application with minimal time, a day or two.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question: What is codeless computing platform? What is the benefit?</p>
<p>Answer: Codeless Computing Platform means the user does not have to do any coding or learn any specific computer language. Our platform does all these already. Users with no technical knowledge can develop business application. A similar analogy is in the past only secretaries  typed. Now everybody uses word processors. Users only need to make an application process by some simple clicks.</p>
<p>Traditional application development results in multiple data islands and interfaces. Imagine you ask two separate IT solution companies to develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and an Account applications, it is highly likely that you have to input data twice by two interfaces. Our platform utilizes only one database. If you develop applications in our platform, you use only one interface, input data once and maintain only one set of data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question: How can I utilize BAX services? What devices are compatible?</p>
<p>Answer: BAX services need web browsers. Computers, iphones and android phones or any smart phone browsers like Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer can access our services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question: How can non-technical people develop applications? Shouldn’t this for smart programmers only?</p>
<p>Answer: Nobody believed everybody could type 60 years ago. Only secretaries did that. With word-processors around, everybody can type because there is no penalty for typing wrongly. BAX Application Generator provides a “What You See is What you Get” development environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question : How can an application be developed within a day or two by ordinary people when programmers say they need 3 to 6 months?</p>
<p>Answer: A typical application development process includes</p>
<ul>
<li>requirement gathering and confirmation, 1 month</li>
<li>prototyping and programming, 1 month</li>
<li>testing, 2 weeks</li>
<li>installation, 2 weeks</li>
</ul><p>That is a 3 month lead time.</p>
<p>For BAX, the back-end system with business logic, complex code and database are already there. Therefore, with the “What You See is What you Get” development environment, all these are done when you gather the user requirements. Please visit our demonstration video to see how we develop an application in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Question: My internet access is not stable and that storing data in the cloud at BAX platform seems not convenient. Can I install BAX software in my own server?</p>
<p>Answer: Well, we are just starting off and we plan to add in server software version. However, we strongly recommend you to test out our service via the web-space before initiating any purchase. We want you to be 100% satisfied with our platform before spending more money. Please drop us a mail, twitter or facebook instant message if you are interested in getting a server software version.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question: Are you saying that I can sell my application?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, you are right. BAX Marketplace allows users to host their applications for sale / trial in the web-space. Users decide whether they would like to charge other users for using their developed applications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Question: I like BAX services. But I have data in existing applications. It is impossible for me to change to your services.</p>
<p>Answer: Our services accept data from Excel spreadsheet. As long as your input data is in CSV format file, BAX can import it.</p></div>","What motivation causes us to start this project?
In 2007, Winson was trying to sell computer hardware, software and network devices with his associates on the web. Although he and his associates were engineers, they found building an e-commerce site and all intranet operational applications involved huge amount of money and time. They realized something was wrong therefore they then spent the following 5 years on developing the “Codeless Computing Platform” to facilitate an economical method of rapid application development.
 
Shred IT expenses, time and effort by 90% + 
Have you ever purchased or got quotes from Information Technology solution providers at staggering prices? Have you ever waited for a long time for these application to be ready? Have you ever wondered why computer programs must be done by technical experts? Have you wondered whether this money and time spent is worth your investment?
We have. And therefore, we built a platform that facilitates users to:

Spend only $200 per year for applications/infrastructure
Create an application in a day
Develop applications without technical knowledge
Use one ""Company-wide"" database across all applications
Not only do we believe that applications should be created with minimal time, money, expertise and effort, but also, we believe that applications should and can be shared across the globe.
 
Current IT issues
Staggering Cost
Why is it so expensive in developing applications? The cost involved are-

Hardware cost
Software cost
Application Development cost
Maintenance cost including network fees, software maintenance
Future upgrade cost
Just a simple web application like on-line marketing survey or order taking, may cost at least $8,000 to $10,000 already.
Long lead-time
Even if you would like to spend these huge expenses, the lead time is unbearable. It may take 3 to 6 months to develop a simple application. It includes requirement gathering and confirmation, prototyping, programming, testing, installation etc..
Programming difficulties
What then is the real problem? The ugly truth is software applications started off with “hard-code” in mind. This means that only computer programmers can develop applications. While high-paid computer programmers are expert in programming, they do not know much about your business processes. So, they have to spend time and effort to understand your business process before even drafting anything. You can imagine there is enormous cost.
 
How we drive down cost, time and remove programming barrier: Codeless Computing
Our view is totally different,  ”Applications must be code free.”  Software system should be able to handle all back-end development. Business owners should just handle application development themselves to drive down the cost. (The same analogy happened decades ago, only secretaries typed for the bosses. Now, everybody uses the Word Processor.)
We visualize the system should-

Be code free
Have a single interface
Use one database across all applications
Be Zero hardware / software cost
Charge minimal cost
Incur minimal development time
Support multi-language
Be usable by personal computers, mobiles and tablets
Users can develop their applications with simple points and clicks. So, anybody should be able to develop a simple application within a day or two.
Results of deploying canned solutions, eventually you were creating multiple data islands. Imagine you ask two different solution providers to deploy a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and an Account applications, it is highly likely that you have to input data twice by two interfaces. In contrast, BAX assigned only one dedicated database for each company therefore if you develop applications in our BAX platform then you use only one interface, input data once and maintain only one set of data.
BAX is a profile driven programming environment. Users need to fill in the detail of an application profile “form” then a module will be generated accordingly. A lot of pre-built functions are ready to use e.g. Document Audit Trailing, Document Add/Edit controlling etc.  BAX platform is not Independent Development Environment (IDE). It is much simpler than IDE. Better still, it is on the cloud. It means that once an app is developed, it can be used instantly.
 
What we offer
Default business applications
A platform on Cloud comes with the most commonly used business applications:

Customer profile
Vendor profile
Sale Lead Management application
Purchase application
Account application
IT Helpdesk
Document Library application
Our platform supports multi-language in all field labels and data. We provide full flexibility for each user who can choose his/her preferred language.
All of these applications can be customized by changing the application profile settings to meet user requirements. In our current practice, while we are getting user requirements, we can modify the application and show the application final results on the spot. In this way, an application is created already.
Application Generator
We know you want more than our default applications. Our Application Generator allows you to add your own application. We provide all simple Web development interfaces for you to “Do It Yourself” and save cost and money.
How much savings you can get from developing your own application? Let me give you an example. The most prominent Customer Relationship Management service provider, salesforce.com is charging a whopping $250 per user / month for their highest end customizable solution. If there are only 5 users in the company, it costs $15,000 per year. We charge you only $200. That is a 98.67% savings. Remember our system does not confine a user to customize only the CRM application. All BAX applications are 100% customizable.
Application Sharing / Selling as a business
Since applications can be easily developed through our platform, we believe users would like to share / sell their applications.
Can you imagine that you once are spending money on business applications can now earn money from developing applications? You can turn your brilliant business processes into an application and sell to the whole world. “BAX Application Marketplace” allows you to do so.

Frequently Asked Questions
Question: Why do you do this project? What is your vision?
Answer: We believe that computing and automation should not have high cost of entry.  Our vision is Information Technology (1) should be provided at a very affordable cost. It should be at most 10% of the current cost. In the event that only a SME with fewer than 5 persons, 90%+ of the cost can be saved. (2) Development time should be within a day or two. (3) Anybody can do this. (4) Since anybody can develop applications, these applications should be shared / sold easily in web-space.
 
Question: Your project has an interesting name, Business Application Express?
Answer: Our vision is to facilitate Codeless Computing Platform to develop application with minimal time, a day or two.
 
Question: What is codeless computing platform? What is the benefit?
Answer: Codeless Computing Platform means the user does not have to do any coding or learn any specific computer language. Our platform does all these already. Users with no technical knowledge can develop business application. A similar analogy is in the past only secretaries  typed. Now everybody uses word processors. Users only need to make an application process by some simple clicks.
Traditional application development results in multiple data islands and interfaces. Imagine you ask two separate IT solution companies to develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and an Account applications, it is highly likely that you have to input data twice by two interfaces. Our platform utilizes only one database. If you develop applications in our platform, you use only one interface, input data once and maintain only one set of data.
 
Question: How can I utilize BAX services? What devices are compatible?
Answer: BAX services need web browsers. Computers, iphones and android phones or any smart phone browsers like Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer can access our services.
 
Question: How can non-technical people develop applications? Shouldn’t this for smart programmers only?
Answer: Nobody believed everybody could type 60 years ago. Only secretaries did that. With word-processors around, everybody can type because there is no penalty for typing wrongly. BAX Application Generator provides a “What You See is What you Get” development environment.
 
Question : How can an application be developed within a day or two by ordinary people when programmers say they need 3 to 6 months?
Answer: A typical application development process includes

requirement gathering and confirmation, 1 month
prototyping and programming, 1 month
testing, 2 weeks
installation, 2 weeks
That is a 3 month lead time.
For BAX, the back-end system with business logic, complex code and database are already there. Therefore, with the “What You See is What you Get” development environment, all these are done when you gather the user requirements. Please visit our demonstration video to see how we develop an application in 3 minutes.
 
Question: My internet access is not stable and that storing data in the cloud at BAX platform seems not convenient. Can I install BAX software in my own server?
Answer: Well, we are just starting off and we plan to add in server software version. However, we strongly recommend you to test out our service via the web-space before initiating any purchase. We want you to be 100% satisfied with our platform before spending more money. Please drop us a mail, twitter or facebook instant message if you are interested in getting a server software version.
 
Question: Are you saying that I can sell my application?
Answer: Yes, you are right. BAX Marketplace allows users to host their applications for sale / trial in the web-space. Users decide whether they would like to charge other users for using their developed applications.
 
Question: I like BAX services. But I have data in existing applications. It is impossible for me to change to your services.
Answer: Our services accept data from Excel spreadsheet. As long as your input data is in CSV format file, BAX can import it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risks and challenges are as follows:</p>
<p>Taking a product from a prototype into mass production will always surface new challenges that have to be addressed. It takes time and patience to make the right call and can even lead to minor changes and tweaks in the appearance than what the prototypes currently show. Since this will be the first production run, we may have to change some things and will let everyone know about any changes via project updates.</p>
<p>Production delays: <br/>We are working with extremely experienced machining and finishing suppliers that are used to handling quantities well over the amount that are typical for Kickstarter which means that there is little risk of a production bottleneck. Though it is unlikely, delays can still happen as machinery can break down, raw materials can arrive late etc. which can create unanticipated setbacks. If this highly unlikely scenario takes place, frequent communication and transparency with our backers is our top priority.</p>

III elements
What makes Voyage so appealing. 

Locked in Handmade Timber Pen-case 
Hidden in Genuine Leather Pouch 
Made from Space-grade Aluminium Body

 
III functions
The Voyage in writing space.
 

The Pen - It’s a usual pen living in an unusual body. Made from space-grade aluminium to give you an experience of reliability and confidence for years. 
The Pencil - We know how important it is to sketch something before you write it down, so here it is: fully automatic, always sharp and just a twist away from the pen. 
The Touch Pen - For convenient use of devices with touch screen like tablets, smartphones or laptops. Specially designed shape of rubber end prevents from scratches on the screen surface, extending its lifetime. It’s irreplaceable when you need to write something quick.
 So, u can draft it, write it and send it using your Voyage and any type of touch device. III virtues
Trinity that u need for eternity.
 

Solid - Due to the design and components, it’s one of those things that you will pass to your descendant… unwillingly. 
Elegant - Looks like a pen, not like a heavy machine gun. 
Handy - Compass and thermometer are not included. Because you know what you need at work. 

Short Summary 
✅ Space-grade aluminium
✅ Automatic pencil
✅ Minimalistic and elegant design

SaaS Platform provides several built-in system roles which serve specific functions within SaaS Platform, and which provide common roles and functions. System roles are pre-defined in SaaS Platform. Some system roles may be assigned to specific user accounts to perform certain types of actions. Other system roles are special roles which allow you to grant certain users permissions to access specific objects.RAD is one of the most successful software development programs available today, with numerous benefits for both software development teams as well as their clients.Here are just a few advantages:
RAD lets you break the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks.
The task-oriented structure allows project managers to optimize their team’s efficiency by assigning tasks according to members’ specialities and experience.
Clients get a working product delivered in a shorter time frame.
Regular communication and constant feedback between team members and stakeholders increases the efficiency of the design and build process.
With a shorter planning phase and a focus on highly iterative design and construction, RAD teams are able to accomplish more in less time without sacrificing client satisfaction.A win-win for both project managers and clients.   We are currently in the development phase.We need donations, so we can have a good test of our platform. We need $3,500 for Amazon, AWS and Digital Ocean credit.We are developing this fundraising campaign to solicit for your support which may be financial or in-kind (technical support, advice, and suggestions). Please feel free to donate any amount you can. Each donation procures a codified voucher. Regardless of whatever you donate, you will be issued a certificate of appreciation/recognition which will reflect the amount donated and a number of coded vouchers rewarded.  Even if you can't make a donation, you can still help us meet our goal!If you are ready to join this exciting journey with us, please support our campaign and spread the word! A few clicks for you make a big difference for us. Each contribution or donation will receive a ‘thank you letter’ plus coded certificate (soft copy) as evidence of your contribution and for reference purposes. This is in addition to other rewards (see below indicated in Perks). The concept of design for SaaS Platform is based on the FLAT design and finally, it comes out with a clean and neat design. It is built on top of the popular Bootstrap Framework. Besides that, it is bundled with a lot of third-party plugins and other usable elements. 
What is SaaS Platform?

<p>We ask you for a funding of $1300. Without your help we would need months to get the funds to pay for the printing and shipping. So we hope you like the chance to preorder the Sketchbook.</p>
<p>Most of it will be used to pay the printing company. <br/>The production is so expensive, because we demand high quality, want to produce in Germany and only with a certain amount we can order for an cost-efficient calculation.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>I created Mesh-It, the world's first silent fidget pen as a discreet solution for fidgeters in an office or classroom setting.</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Currently, I'm a secondary teacher in Texas. After 16 years of teaching, I identified a desperate need to find a resource for my students and colleagues that would keep their hands occupied with minimal distractions.</p>
<p>I suffered from ADHD as a child and struggled to focus in the classroom. As a fidgeter myself, I discovered that a tangible object helped me focus. I created the Mesh-It pen (patent pending) to help quietly relieve nervous energy in both schools and offices alike.</p>
<p>The Mesh-It pen is an alternative to popular gadgets like the Fidget Spinner. Most of these sensory gadgets are highly visual and make noise becoming more of an interruption than a fix.</p>
<p>I have more than students in mind for the Mesh-It pen. My friends often vent to me about antsy co-workers who disrupt meetings with retractable pens or loud child-like widgets. The Mesh-It pen was truly created for all the nervous pen clickers of the world. </p>

<h2>
<strong><br/></strong>Besides, we still want to improve the Alivemaker LANDr:</h2>
<p><span>So the final LANDr you get may be a little bit different from the LANDr you see here.</span></p>
<p><br/><span>For example:</span><br/><span>1.We are working tightly together with lots of manufacturing partners and we may be able to change all the 3D printed parts into polyamides or ABS plastic injection, this would improve the reliability and durability. What you have seen in the video and photos is our prototype LANDr. We have melt down and reborn the LANDr for thousands times to perfect our design. (We believe it is one of the most useful aspects of 3D printers to test the design and rework it if needed).</span><br/><span>2.We may have to adjust the final appearance before the LANDr ships. But this will be just a little adjustment, not a big change. We would like to improve the quality of LANDr, and we also want to make it easy and fast to produce so our backers will get the Alivemaker LANDr fast.</span><br/><span>3.In the near future, we would like to make speciall IOS or Andriod Apps for Alivemaker, such as some software for 3D scanning, 3D Printing Controll, or Sharing. But this kind of software will not be finished in a short period. We will try to speed it up. ^_^</span><br/><span>4. We've staggered the rewards into several manageable batches so that we can meet our delivery targets on-time. However, Testing and Certification must be finished before the Alivemaker LANDr can be shipped. We've been careful to design and assemble the printer to make it more safe and reliable, but there is always a risk of delay while the product undergoes final testing and certification.</span></p>

such as the Alivemaker Custom USB-Flash card
 

 
Beside, we also provide Alivemaker custom T- shirts for our backers. Every T-shirt will have "" Alivemaker Pioneer"" printed on it. This will be limited and we hope it will be an honor for the backers. ""We are so Proud of you"".

Here's a tip we just forget to inform before
All of the perks were including shipping fees to worldwide, but not including the tax which it may occured.
 
 
Why Indiegogo?
We've been working on our hardware and software applications for over a year. We're very proud of the work we've done so far, but we need one more push to get it into production. Through Indiegogo you're ORDERING the Alivemaker LANDr . With your support, we will be able to bring the  Alivemaker LANDr 3D printer worldwide and carry on developing more useful, smart and affordable desktop 3D printers. While we're super close to entering production, your contribution will help fund:
 

Tooling and manufacturing setup.
Our first production run.
the development of some iOS and Android applications for 3D Printing Controll or 3D Scanning.
 

Besides, we still want to improve the Alivemaker LANDr:
So the final LANDr you get may be a little bit different from the LANDr you see here.
For example:1.We are working tightly together with lots of manufacturing partners and we may be able to change all the 3D printed parts into polyamides or ABS plastic injection, this would improve the reliability and durability. What you have seen in the video and photos is our prototype LANDr. We have melt down and reborn the LANDr for thousands times to perfect our design. (We believe it is one of the most useful aspects of 3D printers to test the design and rework it if needed).2.We may have to adjust the final appearance before the LANDr ships. But this will be just a little adjustment, not a big change. We would like to improve the quality of LANDr, and we also want to make it easy and fast to produce so our backers will get the Alivemaker LANDr fast.3.In the near future, we would like to make speciall IOS or Andriod Apps for Alivemaker, such as some software for 3D scanning, 3D Printing Controll, or Sharing. But this kind of software will not be finished in a short period. We will try to speed it up. ^_^4. We've staggered the rewards into several manageable batches so that we can meet our delivery targets on-time. However, Testing and Certification must be finished before the Alivemaker LANDr can be shipped. We've been careful to design and assemble the printer to make it more safe and reliable, but there is always a risk of delay while the product undergoes final testing and certification.
Last BUT not Least
For now, any news or update would be posted on these two website:

<p>My name is Breck and I make public domain software.</p>
<p>Recently I got fed up with the way Americans are forced to do taxes, and decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>This is the CopyPasteTaxes project, and I am confident it can change the way Americans do taxes and make the system work better for everyone*.</p>
<p>But I'm not going to do this unless other people think it's a good idea and believe in it too.</p>
<p>So that's why I'm launching this IndieGogo. If you believe in this and want to make it happen, please support this project.</p>
<p>There will be no perks or gimmicks. Just a public domain application that you can use for your taxes, as soon as this year. Of course, you will have my gratititude and the gratitude of your fellows Americans, because if we do this thing this is gonna rock.</p>

<p><strong>Inspire</strong>: Your buds send you suggestions (“springs”) for specific things they’d love to see you do or experience. Their job is to expand your thinking. Your job is to be open. When a spring resonates with you (no matter how little or big!), you post it to your Spring Board. You can post your own springs as well, as you never know when inspiration will strike.</p>

Although you may not take action on a spring right away, the seed has been planted. You update your Spring Board when you “tap” any of your springs. Need a boost? Your buds are there to encourage and support you. When a spring has sprung, you celebrate!</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Grow</strong>: As you receive springs, there can be a tendency towards resistance. Don’t worry about taking action on all of your springs right away; in time you will see that the springs, like seeds, start to work all on their own! As you move into the unknown, you will discover unexpected things about yourself that will amaze you. The point is that you’re perpetually, actively engaged in things that resonate with you. There is no goal, no end, no destination, but continuous renewal and a journey sure to unfold in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><em>And, just as important as it is to tend to your own Spring Board, posting springs on your buds’ boards is just as meaningful! Connecting with your buds and giving back renews the cycle.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Spring Board is not a bucket list.</strong></h2>
<p>With Spring Board:</p>
<p><strong>There is no bucket</strong>. The bucket can symbolize death, and bring fear into the process. The goals on a bucket list also tend to put fulfillment in the future, not the present.</p>
<p><strong>There is no goal</strong>. Setting goals can imply that success is only achieved by accomplishing the goal exactly as set forth. Goals are rigid, and don’t account for flexibility and wonderful tangents.</p>
<h2><strong>What Fuels You?</strong></h2>
<p>What gets you, excites you, nourishes you — what resonates with you? <strong>This is the core of Spring Board</strong> — making a habit of engaging in things that resonate with you.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind Spring Board is summed up in this: <em>“The vitality of your life does not depend on how much you achieve, but in how often you engage in things that resonate with you.”</em>  — My father-in-law, Ted Case (10,000 Year Thinking®)</p>
<p><strong>Ready to try it out?  </strong></p>
<p>Here's a <a href=""http://springboardapp.wufoo.com/forms/what-fuels-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>30-second exercise</strong></a> to get you started...</p>
<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Chris, and I'm the creative director behind Spring Board. A year-and-a-half ago, I was sitting around with some friends and family when one of us said she wanted to do something ""big"" in the year ahead. She had recently divorced, and was ready for some changes. She wanted to do something big for herself, but didn't quite know what to do or where to begin.</p>
<p>My father-in-law told her to get a pen and paper, and looked at the rest of us: ""Let's brainstorm some ‘big things’ for her to do."" We all jumped on board and started offering suggestions of things we thought would be fun, adventurous, challenging, transformative — and her only job was to stay open and write everything down. Within 20 minutes she had a surprising list of almost 50 things — from take a yoga class, to go on an international adventure, to buy an expensive pair of jeans, go on a date, take salsa lessons, and follow a new blog.</p>
<p>The creative juices flowing, it wasn't long before we all wanted a turn. We spent time brainstorming for each other, and finished inspired and motivated for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Over the next several months, something amazing happened — the lists we had created slowly began to seep into our lives, without effort. Not only was I inspired by what was happening for me, but watching my friends and family be transformed was just as exhilarating. My sister-in-law did start yoga... then she went on her first date, and then she went to China. My wife, Abby, quit her job, started her own business, made a new friend, and ran a 5K... As for me, I ran a half-marathon (having never run before in my life!), composed music for an iPad app, wrote a song for my 3-year old son, and started working on the big one — the creation of my first app. I began to realize that brainstorming a list with my closest friends and family planted a seed in my consciousness, and the items that resonated with me found their way into my life on their own accord. By writing them down, an awareness was cultivated that allowed me to jump on opportunities as they naturally arose. </p>
<p>After that, without fail, everyone we told about this resonance brainstorm asked us to do one for them. Before long, we had people joining improv comedy classes, getting energy healings, drinking daily green smoothies, trying new sports, and — my personal favorite — at the suggestion of doing a ""polar bear dip"", my own mother jumped into the Atlantic Ocean at midnight on her 60th birthday — in the middle of December!</p>
<p>From this experience, I’ve learned that tapping into what resonates with me is the #1 way to bring an energetic passion to everything I do. And just as important, to determine what is not worth doing. Engaging in resonance provides a horizon to follow, and shines light on the beauty of the journey. It reveals adventure everywhere you look. </p>
<p>As Ted says, <em>""The dynamics of creative energy imply that when you change your world, you change everyone else's as well.""</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Spring Board Team</strong></h2>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://springboardapp.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chris_Abby_profile.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;""/>Spring Board’s team is made up of husband and wife pair Chris and Abby Fitzgerald. He is a tech geek, Berklee trained film composer and the creative mind behind Spring Board. She is an MBA marketing guru with her own consulting business, a decade of admissions experience, and a passion for entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><span>The philosophy behind Spring Board stems from Ted Case's 10,000 YEAR Thinking® modality. </span>A thought leader in creative conciousness, Ted has decades of experience working with entreprenuers and individuals in the dynamics of human potential and effective change. (Ted is the wise father-in-law from the story above.) <a href=""https://twitter.com/10KYT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Follow Ted on Twitter @10KYT</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>I need your help</strong></h2>
<p>I fully believe that this app can make real and sustainable change in people's lives. I want people to get inspired, do inspiring things, inspire others, and basically have kick-ass stories to tell. All the time. To get this app off the ground will require an independent, grass-roots effort led by YOU. Get behind this app, and you'll already have one cool story to tell!</p>
<p>It's crucial that the app have top-notch design and development, with an organic user experience, and cutting-edge social network connectability. This can be done with $25,000. Indiegogo and processing fees, taxes and rewards will come to around $10,000, thus $35,000 total.</p>
<p>To be straight up with all of you potential backers,</p>
<p>I love this app idea, and want to see it succeed. I've realized (and this is sort of what Spring Board is all about) that while risks should be taken into account, focusing on them too much causes paralyzation on a project. I'm excited to see how far I can take Spring Board. It will be fun, and I would love it if you would join me to get this app made!</p></div>","Spring [spring]

Inspire: Your buds send you suggestions (“springs”) for specific things they’d love to see you do or experience. Their job is to expand your thinking. Your job is to be open. When a spring resonates with you (no matter how little or big!), you post it to your Spring Board. You can post your own springs as well, as you never know when inspiration will strike.



Engage: Visit your Spring Board often. Although you may not take action on a spring right away, the seed has been planted. You update your Spring Board when you “tap” any of your springs. Need a boost? Your buds are there to encourage and support you. When a spring has sprung, you celebrate!

Grow: As you receive springs, there can be a tendency towards resistance. Don’t worry about taking action on all of your springs right away; in time you will see that the springs, like seeds, start to work all on their own! As you move into the unknown, you will discover unexpected things about yourself that will amaze you. The point is that you’re perpetually, actively engaged in things that resonate with you. There is no goal, no end, no destination, but continuous renewal and a journey sure to unfold in unexpected ways.
And, just as important as it is to tend to your own Spring Board, posting springs on your buds’ boards is just as meaningful! Connecting with your buds and giving back renews the cycle.
Spring Board is not a bucket list.
With Spring Board:
There is no bucket. The bucket can symbolize death, and bring fear into the process. The goals on a bucket list also tend to put fulfillment in the future, not the present.
There is no goal. Setting goals can imply that success is only achieved by accomplishing the goal exactly as set forth. Goals are rigid, and don’t account for flexibility and wonderful tangents.
What Fuels You?
What gets you, excites you, nourishes you — what resonates with you? This is the core of Spring Board — making a habit of engaging in things that resonate with you.
The philosophy behind Spring Board is summed up in this: “The vitality of your life does not depend on how much you achieve, but in how often you engage in things that resonate with you.”  — My father-in-law, Ted Case (10,000 Year Thinking®)
Ready to try it out?  
Here's a 30-second exercise to get you started...
My Story
My name is Chris, and I'm the creative director behind Spring Board. A year-and-a-half ago, I was sitting around with some friends and family when one of us said she wanted to do something ""big"" in the year ahead. She had recently divorced, and was ready for some changes. She wanted to do something big for herself, but didn't quite know what to do or where to begin.
My father-in-law told her to get a pen and paper, and looked at the rest of us: ""Let's brainstorm some ‘big things’ for her to do."" We all jumped on board and started offering suggestions of things we thought would be fun, adventurous, challenging, transformative — and her only job was to stay open and write everything down. Within 20 minutes she had a surprising list of almost 50 things — from take a yoga class, to go on an international adventure, to buy an expensive pair of jeans, go on a date, take salsa lessons, and follow a new blog.
The creative juices flowing, it wasn't long before we all wanted a turn. We spent time brainstorming for each other, and finished inspired and motivated for the year ahead.
Over the next several months, something amazing happened — the lists we had created slowly began to seep into our lives, without effort. Not only was I inspired by what was happening for me, but watching my friends and family be transformed was just as exhilarating. My sister-in-law did start yoga... then she went on her first date, and then she went to China. My wife, Abby, quit her job, started her own business, made a new friend, and ran a 5K... As for me, I ran a half-marathon (having never run before in my life!), composed music for an iPad app, wrote a song for my 3-year old son, and started working on the big one — the creation of my first app. I began to realize that brainstorming a list with my closest friends and family planted a seed in my consciousness, and the items that resonated with me found their way into my life on their own accord. By writing them down, an awareness was cultivated that allowed me to jump on opportunities as they naturally arose. 
After that, without fail, everyone we told about this resonance brainstorm asked us to do one for them. Before long, we had people joining improv comedy classes, getting energy healings, drinking daily green smoothies, trying new sports, and — my personal favorite — at the suggestion of doing a ""polar bear dip"", my own mother jumped into the Atlantic Ocean at midnight on her 60th birthday — in the middle of December!
From this experience, I’ve learned that tapping into what resonates with me is the #1 way to bring an energetic passion to everything I do. And just as important, to determine what is not worth doing. Engaging in resonance provides a horizon to follow, and shines light on the beauty of the journey. It reveals adventure everywhere you look. 
As Ted says, ""The dynamics of creative energy imply that when you change your world, you change everyone else's as well.""
The Spring Board Team
Spring Board’s team is made up of husband and wife pair Chris and Abby Fitzgerald. He is a tech geek, Berklee trained film composer and the creative mind behind Spring Board. She is an MBA marketing guru with her own consulting business, a decade of admissions experience, and a passion for entrepreneurship.
The philosophy behind Spring Board stems from Ted Case's 10,000 YEAR Thinking® modality. A thought leader in creative conciousness, Ted has decades of experience working with entreprenuers and individuals in the dynamics of human potential and effective change. (Ted is the wise father-in-law from the story above.) Follow Ted on Twitter @10KYT.
I need your help
I fully believe that this app can make real and sustainable change in people's lives. I want people to get inspired, do inspiring things, inspire others, and basically have kick-ass stories to tell. All the time. To get this app off the ground will require an independent, grass-roots effort led by YOU. Get behind this app, and you'll already have one cool story to tell!
It's crucial that the app have top-notch design and development, with an organic user experience, and cutting-edge social network connectability. This can be done with $25,000. Indiegogo and processing fees, taxes and rewards will come to around $10,000, thus $35,000 total.
To be straight up with all of you potential backers,
I love this app idea, and want to see it succeed. I've realized (and this is sort of what Spring Board is all about) that while risks should be taken into account, focusing on them too much causes paralyzation on a project. I'm excited to see how far I can take Spring Board. It will be fun, and I would love it if you would join me to get this app made!",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Nullbits Story</h3>
<p>Nullbits was started by 3 engineers in Boulder, Colorado that have a passion for gaming and extremely high-quality computer accessories. We came up with the DB1 Pro because we couldn't find the hardware we were looking for. It simply didn't exist at the level we knew was possible.  So we decided to go and create it. </p>
<ul>
<li>The DB1 Pro has 4 fully customizable macro keys</li>
<li>Easy to program and use for any purpose</li>
<li>Built in audio enhancement &amp; 16-bit USB DAC</li>
<li>Custom RGB</li>
</ul>
<p>We wanted an easily programmable macro keyboard, that can be used by anyone. We did all the software, so you don't have to. And the DB1 Pro really is what we wanted to create for ourselves. </p>
<p>Once you start using it, it's hard to go on without it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Small batch hardware with custom designed parts is very expensive in low quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our minimum goal of $16,000 is based on having enough orders pre-filled that we can make our first large order on parts</li>
<li>This will cut the costs to us and make the DB1 Pro accessible to everyone </li>
<li>Above the initial goal, the rest of the funding will go to additional order fulfillment and what is left over will go towards holding an inventory that we can sell on our site directly</li>
<li>We intend on creating more products in the future. This campaign makes that dream a reality for us</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Assembled in the USA</h3>
<p>Every DB1 Pro is hand-assembled, inspected, and tested in the USA. The aluminum case is made in Colorado. Other parts will be sourced from around the world with the highest quality being our top priority. If it isn't perfect, we don't put it inside a DB1.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Potential Roadblocks</h3>
<p>Our main hurdle in getting Nullbits off the ground is simply getting enough pre-orders in so we can do a volume order from our parts suppliers. The extremely high cost of small batch orders just isn't feasible and scalable. </p>
<p>This is our primary goal with this campaign. In addition, we really want to get our company off the ground so we can create more amazing, high-quality products in the future. Believe us, we have a lot planned!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help out by preordering a DB1 Pro, please consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing our campaign on your social media or with friends and family</li>
<li>Buying some stickers ($10) to support our company, and get some cool swag in the process!</li>

<h2>Who am I ?</h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>my name is Christian, 22 years old and I'm an electricity student from Berlin. I had an idea few months ago while riding my bike.</p>
<p>I always like listen to music while I ride bike and there is nothing worse than an empty MP3 Player after just starting my tour. So I began trying to find a solution for my problem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then I've developped the de.light bicycle lamp.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How does my lamp work ?</h2>
<p>The functionality of my de.light lamp is based on a regular bicycle lamp. Only that this one has an integrated USB-port which makes it very easy to recharge mobile devices such as smartphones or MP3-Player.</p>
<p>Once the 6V dynamo is enabled you just need to pedal and the device will get charged.</p>
<h2><strong>What's the goal ?</strong></h2>
<p>I hope that my idea will help a lot of people who never want to be dependent on a socket anymore just like me. </p>
<p>For now the goal is collecting the needed amount of money to produce a batch. </p>

<h2>Another way to help?</h2>
<p>If you can´t donate but still think that my project is pretty cool then share or post it in your social networks or tell your friends. That would be really great as well.</p>

tractors and machinery, and industrial electrical generators greater than 20
KW. 
The market
This is a first to market, very
unique offering! There is currently no Noninvasive product similar to Engine
Guard anywhere in the world!
Main characteristics:
* Automatic operation – the product comes into operation immediately upon
starting the vehicle. It then carries out a self-test to make certain the
sensors are functioning properly – the temperature sensor and the level of
cooling fluid sensor.
* Warning of a fault in the
system – warns when a fault has been located during the self-test stage, or
during driving time and it’s shown by specific icons with different colors on a
color touch screen as well as by an audible alarm in each case. Furthermore,
the color screen has also two alphanumeric rows were the fault is indicated to
the driver in the Language chosen during the installation of the product.
* Constant monitoring – the
temperature and level of cooling fluid in the engine's cooling system are
monitored during the whole time of the engine's operation. In addition, every time the engine
starts, The Green Function will examine whether the engine
reaches optimal working temperature condition in within 15 - 30 minutes. The
Green Function will constantly examine whether the engine temperature
is lower than the recommended working temperature. Should the engine work at a
colder temperature than that recommended, then the engine consumes more
fuel than usual, its wear, soot and tear is greater and the air
pollution coming from the engine is much higher.* Warnings of engine faults using
GSM (two way communications) infrastructure and Global Positioning System (GPS)
– at any stage during the operation of the engine, should one and/or two of the
parameters monitored be found to be deviating from the safe working range, the
system will activate an audio-visual and alphanumeric warning to the driver and
to predetermined telephone numbers and will report on the type of fault and
location of the vehicle through the GSM/ GPS system!


* Keeping a log – the system
keeps the time and date as well as the type of fault of the warnings and
records it in the system's memory.
* The system will be designed for
giving high reliability (min. 10 years MTBF) to avoid giving false warnings.
* Automatic discontinuation –
the operation of the ""Engine Guard"" system is discontinued upon
switching-off the engine.* Easy installation – the electronics
control and display unit communicates in 2-way com with the sensor unit via the
+/- power cables of the vehicle. The units are installed by securing them
mechanically in their place and then connecting them to the +/- power cables,
that’s all that it’s needed!

<p><b>S</b><b>LEEPMAN UPGRADES ARE BASED ON</b><b> KICKSTARTER COMMUNITY ADVICES AND SUGGESTIONS.</b> We’ve cancelled our successfully funded Kickstarter campaign just over a year ago to implement our backer’s ideas and address their concerns. Finally, we are back with new Sleepman: smaller, sleeker, and fully upgraded. We’ve focused on the features that are crucial to our wellbeing, needed by most of us and unique to the Sleepman.</p>

<p>Check your activity level, sleeping data, meditate, or even watch your heart rate in real time without looking at your phone. An optional Sleepman display can be programmed to show the info you prefer. Components we’ve chosen do not consume much energy and would not significantly decrease your battery life. The optional display shares the plugin connectors with the Sleep Enhancer signal amplifier electrode and simply clicks on. It is not mandatory to have the display on for your Sleepman to work properly, it’s rather an accessory for your convenience. A display frame is compatible with any regular 22 mm watch band or bracelet of your choice. If you’d like to have an optional screen please add $29 to your pledge for each Sleepman unit.</p>

<p>The unique E-magnetic Enhancer generates scientifically designed and thoroughly tested micro-current impulses. They intensify your night sleep or daytime power relaxation, gently and absolutely safely. You may not feel them, but they are very effective due to Sleepmans' self-learning algorithms that adjust the impulses to your individual bio-rhythms.</p>

<p>Sleepman stores the history of your heart rhythms, oxygen levels, sleep patterns, daytime tiredness levels, etc. This information can be crucial for early diagnostics of dangerous heart arrhythmias, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and other health issues. The history may help your physician to diagnose your disorders better, cure them more effectively and even prevent the disorders. Sleepman is not a medical device and shouldn’t be treated as one. However, if a health problem happens, Sleepman may help your body to recover much fasterby enhancing your sleep and relaxation.</p>

<p>We have been working on bringing a good night’s sleep to the world for more than three years and now we are ready to share the new Sleepman with you. Sleepman monitors your brain activity and sleep stages through Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors using the most advanced EDA bio-signal tracking algorithms, thoroughly tested, and optimized for more than two decades. EDA monitoring is highly accurate, non-intrusive and does not interfere with your neuro-activity. After the cancellation of our successful 2016 Kickstarter campaign we’ve added heart and oxygen monitors, implemented e-magnetic enhancement system, made new Sleepman water-resistant and more comfortable to wear due to our self-adjustable slap-bracelets that could be put on or changed with one click.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>

The Sleepman team has a wealth of experience in developing and refining products for the mass market and are confident that we can deliver Sleepman as promised.<br/>Based on our previous experience with new products, we understand that unexpected problems and delays with manufacturing and delivery can arise. We’re in talks with manufacturing and assembly partners and are realistic about delivery. We promise to work hard and address any challenges that may arise. We also promise to keep you well-updated on every step of our progress. If any unexpected trouble occurs, you’ll be the first to know about the problem and our way of handling it. The most important phase of our project is to bring Sleepman to you, our backers. We’ll do our best to deliver it on time and exceed your expectations!</p>

SLEEPMAN UPGRADES ARE BASED ON KICKSTARTER COMMUNITY ADVICES AND SUGGESTIONS. We’ve cancelled our successfully funded Kickstarter campaign just over a year ago to implement our backer’s ideas and address their concerns. Finally, we are back with new Sleepman: smaller, sleeker, and fully upgraded. We’ve focused on the features that are crucial to our wellbeing, needed by most of us and unique to the Sleepman.
Sleepman with optional click-on display
New Sleepman display renderings might be slightly different from the actual app which is still in development
 

Check your activity level, sleeping data, meditate, or even watch your heart rate in real time without looking at your phone. An optional Sleepman display can be programmed to show the info you prefer. Components we’ve chosen do not consume much energy and would not significantly decrease your battery life. The optional display shares the plugin connectors with the Sleep Enhancer signal amplifier electrode and simply clicks on. It is not mandatory to have the display on for your Sleepman to work properly, it’s rather an accessory for your convenience. A display frame is compatible with any regular 22 mm watch band or bracelet of your choice. If you’d like to have an optional screen please add $29 to your pledge for each Sleepman unit.

 

 

 

 

 
You may not feel the impulses but surely feel the difference!
The unique E-magnetic Enhancer generates scientifically designed and thoroughly tested micro-current impulses. They intensify your night sleep or daytime power relaxation, gently and absolutely safely. You may not feel them, but they are very effective due to Sleepmans' self-learning algorithms that adjust the impulses to your individual bio-rhythms.

 

 

Daytime drowsiness is our common enemy. Sleepman monitors your activity level and wouldn't let you lose control by warning you of tiredness and focus loss.

 

 

Always wake up on the right side of a bed with Sleepman! Intensified sleep helps you feel energized and Sleepman Power Relaxation Mode takes care of daytime drowsiness even if you have only 15 minutes to spare while working, driving, traveling or staying home.

 
 
 

""It’s so great to see how deep this product goes into complexity to ensure a person’s better life well being by enhancing the every aspect of your sleep, truly fascinated!"" 
""Hi guys, I have just backed, looks like a great project!"" 
""All the best to your project restart...and be sure that I will support you again""
“Thank you for being up-front an honorable about all of this; I will absolutely be back for the next round. ^‿^"" 

 

 

 

Poor sleep & not enough rest are public health epidemics - about 87% of people suffer from sleeping problems! Nothing affects our mood, productivity and creativity as badly as a bad night sleep and a daytime fatigue. By helping you sleep better and boost your energy, Sleepman can make you look younger, and improve your daily performance, memory, general health and wellbeing.

 

 

 

Sleepman stores the history of your heart rhythms, oxygen levels, sleep patterns, daytime tiredness levels, etc. This information can be crucial for early diagnostics of dangerous heart arrhythmias, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and other health issues. The history may help your physician to diagnose your disorders better, cure them more effectively and even prevent the disorders. Sleepman is not a medical device and shouldn’t be treated as one. However, if a health problem happens, Sleepman may help your body to recover much fasterby enhancing your sleep and relaxation.

The estimated Sleepman MSRP is $200 and we've decided to include the optional E-magnetic Enhancer ($50 MSRP) as a gift with every Sleepman unit to our Kickstarter backers. Shipping to US is $8 and international shipping is $19 for any number of Sleepman devices at any pledge level.
Optional equipment at no cost is our way of saying Thank You Backers!
In the Box: 1 Sleepman device (your choice of black or white), 1 USB charger, 1 E-magnetic Impulse Attachment with software and 2 gel electrodes (each electrode can be used up to 100 times), 2 hypoallergenic silicon slap bracelets (black and white), and Sleepman App Download Code.

 

Options and Extras
Click-on Display Kit
An optional click-on display kit includes 1 display (black or white) all needed software, one silicon band (black or white) and a set of 22 mm spring bars. Please add $29 to your pledge for each kit unless it is already included in your pledge reward.

An executive genuine leather kit.
Please add $19 to your pledge for each set unless it is already included in your pledge reward. This option includes 1 leather strap with matte black rings, a hole puncher and an easy adjustment instruction. It can hold Sleepman on either side of a wrist and can be adjusted for any hand.

We have been working on bringing a good night’s sleep to the world for more than three years and now we are ready to share the new Sleepman with you. Sleepman monitors your brain activity and sleep stages through Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors using the most advanced EDA bio-signal tracking algorithms, thoroughly tested, and optimized for more than two decades. EDA monitoring is highly accurate, non-intrusive and does not interfere with your neuro-activity. After the cancellation of our successful 2016 Kickstarter campaign we’ve added heart and oxygen monitors, implemented e-magnetic enhancement system, made new Sleepman water-resistant and more comfortable to wear due to our self-adjustable slap-bracelets that could be put on or changed with one click.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 
 


 
Risks and challenges
We know that bringing a new product to market is a complicated and time consuming process. The Sleepman team has a wealth of experience in developing and refining products for the mass market and are confident that we can deliver Sleepman as promised.Based on our previous experience with new products, we understand that unexpected problems and delays with manufacturing and delivery can arise. We’re in talks with manufacturing and assembly partners and are realistic about delivery. We promise to work hard and address any challenges that may arise. We also promise to keep you well-updated on every step of our progress. If any unexpected trouble occurs, you’ll be the first to know about the problem and our way of handling it. The most important phase of our project is to bring Sleepman to you, our backers. We’ll do our best to deliver it on time and exceed your expectations!",63.0,1,"1 Campaign

collects advices and questions asked to a close group of people. For example you would like to
have an advice from your parents concerning a new job opportunity you have,
because you are not sure if it’s a good one. You send your question, collect advices
and make a better decision, because you may see this situation from another point of view. Many
other features are available to customize your question and get more
information. 















Whether your question is simple or complex, you will be able to get opinions
and answers that you didn’t have before. You can get instant answers using the “urgent question” option, which is a short question
sent to the telephone home screen of the group you have selected. In the other
hand you can send a survey that lasts for days or even weeks. In this case you
might use it as a temporal research, where you will collect data through a long
period of time.




This project will build a system where
users don’t feel alone anymore when they are making a decision. We put people in your pocket to ask them what you want, how
you want.          You can choose different types of
questions such as yes or no, rate, open and option, use
pictures to custom your scenario, select people you want, send it and wait for
their advices. With this application you will also receive questions by
your friends and get the opportunity to help them through hard times.

We live in Pisa, Tuscany. We have found

We thought we could create a different

a simple
tool that helps people in decision making, bringing accurate advices from
reliable people.

The project start is getting closer and
we really need people like you. Your donation will help us hire the programmer

developed the idea, the interface, the functionalities and the design! We have
chosen the Fixed Funding option, because we need exactly what we ask for. We are not

that your contribution is safe. Your donation is refunded if the goal is

9€ donation: You receive our most sincere
regards. Your collaboration means a lot for us! 

25€ donation: You get a guide on how to
create an app! We will provide an easy guide including strategy applied, useful
illustrations, design tips, tools used and economic advice. Every week, during

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bitcoin on Wikipedia"">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency which is ""mined"" or minted by pure computing power. It's like gold mining for computers but with some exciting and innovative technology involved. We will soon see advances in technology which have been brought about by the BTC network and these will be beyond what many can currently imagine. BTC has been around for 4 years and is the most widely used alternative currency in the world. At the current market price, the BTC in circulation today is worth around 150 million US Dollars. There's never been anything as successful as BTC and it will be exciting to see where BTC takes us over the next 10-20 years.</p>
<p>I've followed  BTC over the last four years and would have loved to have been involved other than as an observer from day one but I've always had enough going on with work, study (whilst working), starting and raising a family that I've never had the time to commit to being a 21st century miner.</p>
<p>Now I'm in a position where I don't need to invest so much time into those things, I want to get involved.  BTC is still relatively new but undoubtedly exciting and with the release of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_specific_integrated_circuit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ASIC on Wikipedia"">ASICs</a>) as tools for mining, technological advances which will improve on the current equipment will be ground breaking. With all the new things happening in this technology, who wouldn't want to be part of it?</p>
<h2><strong>What I Need</strong></h2>
<h3><em><strong>Other than 30,487 people to give me $1 each?</strong></em></h3>
<p>There are a range of options when it comes BTC mining. Anybody who has done even a small bit of research will know there are only a few companies producing the hardware needed to be competitive in the BTC mining world. One such company is <a href=""http://www.butterflylabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Butterfly Labs Website"">Butterfly Labs</a> (BFL) who I’ve been following for almost a year. I want to buy BFL ASICs and not just any ASICs because despite having a range of devices I could purchase, I’m shooting for the stars. I'm going for the big kahuna of mining gear; the BFL Minirig.</p>
<p><img alt=""BFL Minirig"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://forums.butterflylabs.com/dbtgallery.php?do=gallery_image&amp;id=112&amp;gal=gallery&amp;type=full"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Butterfly Labs Minirig""/> </p>
<p>The BFL Minirig provides the best return per dollar in the BTC mining scene. At 1500 GigaHashes per second, it literally screams through the BTC network seeking the elusive rewards hidden in the data blocks.  But it comes at a cost of US$29899 plus shipping ($30487 all up) which is what I’m seeking and on top of that, I’ll be paying all customs and import duties.</p>
<h2><strong>How I’ll Use It</strong></h2>
<p>Once I’ve get a Minirig funded, I’ll use it to mine like crazy until I have generated enough BTC to purchase a 2<sup>nd</sup> Minirig. I’m estimating this will take around 260 days. The first Minirig then continues generating BTC which will be turned into the Casascius perks and returned to the campaign investors at the end of the first year while the 2<sup>nd</sup> Minirig will be used to generate the perks for those investors who will receive the Minirig mining proceeds.</p>
<p>After the first year, 100% the BTC generated by the 1<sup>st</sup> Minirig (which you have funded) will be used to fund Indiegogo campaigns on a monthly basis. The actual dollar amount will vary depending on the market rate for BTC. By the end of the first year, I will setup a website through which investors in this campaign can nominate and vote for any Indiegogo campaign they believe deserves funding. Each month, on behalf of the voting community, the winning campaign as voted by investors will receive the equivalent of one month’s BTC generation from the first Minirig which you have funded. No campaign will be allowed to receive more than one donation from this process as I want to make sure we spread the love far and wide. That’s my perpetual “giving back” to the community that is helping me get started and this will be a forever on-going process until such time as the Minirig stops working and can’t be fixed or the BTC runs out – whichever comes first.</p>
<p>So you’re funding my entry into the BTC mining scene which will allow me to generate enough BTC to purchase additional mining equipment. After the first year, the funding you have provided will enable me to provide a perpetual donation to investor-chosen Indiegogo campaigns on a monthly basis.</p>
<h2><strong>What Have I Based Those Figures On?</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Bitcoin 101</em></h3>
<p>Hopefully I can explain how Bitcoins come into existence and how I figure I’ll be able to generate sufficient Bitcoin to be able to purchase a 2<sup>nd</sup> Minirig AND setup a perpetual investment into Indiegogo campaigns after the first year.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are “minted” at a predetermined rate which is roughly one block every 10 minutes. When the Bitcoin network hash-rate increases (as it will when new technology hits the network), the time taken to mine a block will decrease to less than 10 minutes. In order to maintain the 10 minute mining rate, there is a variable introduced into the network called difficulty. When the network hash-rate increases (reducing the speed of which a block is mined), difficulty also increases to bring the mining speed back to 10 minutes per block. In theory, this will maintain the ability to mine Bitcoins until around 2040 (give or take a year or so).</p>
<p>There is no accurate way to predict what the network hash-rate or difficulty will be in one, two, six or 12 months from today but you can make some educated guesses. Best guess at the moment is a jump of 1000% (10x current) for the network difficulty. If that’s the case, a BFL Minirig can be paid off in 88 days but you’ll recall I said 260 days so I’m obviously using a difficulty factor a little higher than what many people are speculating.</p>
<p>For all of my calculations, I’m using a change of 3000% of the current hash-rate and difficulty which, some might claim is unrealistic but let’s face it, my worst case scenario of 3000% allows me plenty of scope to meet or exceed those deadlines I’ve stated I’d like to achieve. There’s no real way to accurately predict what the difficulty will be once ASIC’s hit the market but the world is “guessing” 1000% (10x) and I’m working on 3000% (30x). I figure the world and I will meet someplace in the middle and my goals will be met either on time or earlier.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>I understand this is a big leap of faith for some investors and appreciate you might wish me well but don't want to part with your hard earned cash for this particular venture and I’m OK with that.</p>

<p><b>CREATIVE ANARKY -  and the Art and Science of Touch!</b></p>
<p><b>How cool
does that sound? What does it mean?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our ethos is about democratising <b>3D digital modelling, </b>re-drawing the conventional boundaries by using a software/hardware system that gives you the user a very real sense of touch for a more natural way of working. You have the opportunity to put the ‘passion’ back into digital creativity and the creative freedom to stretch the scope of
your imagination. </b></p>
<p><b>And the great news is that our <b>software/hardware system</b>, our <b>Anarkik 3D Design package that Farah is using in the video, is up for a 3DPrintShow Global Award in the ‘Best Consumer Software’ category. This is fantastic and we<b><b> are thrilled</b></b>! </b></b></p>
<p>(You can vote for us at this link: <a href=""http://rki.lt/15znnRs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rki.lt/15znnRs</a> as the award
is voted for by the public and is not a panel vote. And the award event is in London on 7th Nov 2013.)</p>

<p></p>
<p>Our campaign is about generating greater awareness of our <b>Anarkik
3D Design package: </b>it combines our creative software ‘Cloud9’ with a 3D haptic
device to give the real and powerful sensation of touch and feel to 3D modelling,
plus movement in 3D to more intuitively navigate in a virtual 3D work space.</p>
<p>Add to this the readily available 3D printing
facilities and your models can be transformed into real innovative customised
objects, all at a fraction of the cost not previously thought possible.</p>
<p><b>Why is this such
a powerful and valued concept?</b></p>
<p>Not only does <b>Anarkik 3D Design software </b>enable designer makers, artists and creative
enthusiasts to have full freedom of expression, applied arts and craft
businesses have a digital tool which can provide a distinctive edge and
differentiation because it supports working in 3D through more intuitive 3D interaction.
 After all it is more natural for
designers, artists and makers to think in 3D and work in 3D.</p>

<p><i><b>Image</b>: ‘3D Consequences’ project : 4 designer makers using Anarkik
3D Design package and swopping designs through 3 iterations so each works on
another's model, resulting in 12 objects for 3D printing. The 4 are: Farah
Bandookwala, Elizabeth Armour, Ann Marie Shillito and newbie, Lucy
Robertson, who had little or no experience before this project of 3D modelling
and 3D printing.</i></p>
<p>The ability to create with touch and feel can
provide other major benefits: for example, offering challenges to heads and
hands is a key feature of the creative education process and can be part of
clinical therapy to aid recovery for cognitive, brain and stroke conditions.</p>
<p><b>Why are we
seeking your help?</b></p>
<p>We are making sales. We want to make more
sales to invest in development<b> and</b>
enable as many users as possible to benefit from the unique capabilities of our
product and access 3D printing. </p>
<p>As with all innovatory products, building
market awareness and understanding is critical to stimulate interest. As we
have found from experience, 3D haptics is different and is something that most
people have not experienced. The only effective way to ""get"" the
experience and grasp the significance of touch for digital 3D designing is by a
hands-on demonstration.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve this is by being in
the market place. This means being at shows and exhibitions, giving hands-on
demonstrations and presentations. </p>

As a small business in this sector we cannot afford not to be there.  The cost to exhibit, present an illustrative
range of 3D printed models, for travel and accommodation, etc, for at least 4
people, and to produce the range of perks which we hope will attract you to
support us to do this, is £10000. If we can raise more, this can help us to

“Digital Crafts : Industrial Technologies for applied artists and designer
makers” is about how designer makers are already accessing and using digital
technologies. The book is both inspirational, with 200 colour images of work,
and useful with information about the different technologies and what you need
to know to get access to them.</p>
<p><b>Background </b></p>
<p><b>Anarkik 3D Design</b> as a 3D modelling system grew out of founder
Ann Marie Shillito`s vision for a way of working and designing digitally in 3D,
more attuned to designer makers’ needs and methods of working,offering a way around the barriers
presented by traditional, standard computer aided design packages. Makers think
and do in 3D so Anarkik 3D Design works this way.</p>

<i><b>Image: </b>Haptic - the sense of touch - how do you get across the
sensation of actually touching a virtual object other than physically
experiencing this?</i><p></p>
<p>It is this that is so special about Anarkik 3D Design: the use of
3D haptics and physically moving your hand in 3 dimensions, in x, y and z axes.
Haptics means 'touch' and a Falcon haptic device provides not only the
capability to touch and feel in 3D, to feel the process of modelling, shaping
and constructing,  you also more easily move
and navigate within your virtual 3D work space and ‘know’ where you are. This makes
Anarkik 3D Design very accessible, easy to learn and enjoyable to use. It looks
strange and the sensation is strange - but only for a very short
time because it taps into how we naturally interact with 3 dimensional
things in the real world.</p>
<p>Affordable, and easy to learn and use, Anarkik 3D Design offers the
means to produce unique, customised and innovatory items and jewellery. </p>

capacity to produce in a diverse range of materials including precious metals,
such as titanium, gold and silver, as well as ceramics, steel, nylon, bronze,
composites, glass, plastics and even chocolate. </p>
<p>As an example of what is possible, one of the most treasured
things that Ann Marie created is the wedding ring in titanium that her eldest
daughter Kari wanted so much, as featured below. The wedding ring and the
interlocking engagement ring were designed, in consultation with Kari, using our
Anarkik 3D Design software system, then prototypes were 3D printed to test for
fit, and finally the wedding ring was 3D printed in titanium.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>How is this affordable?</b></p>
<p>Anarkik 3D Design costs £600 (approx $900/€700). This is a bundle
price for both software (Cloud9) and the Falcon haptic device and can be bought
from our company’s distributors or direct as a special offer from us only during
this crowdfunding project. </p>
<p>You can also buy your own 3D printer – prices can be as low as
£700 – or as we also do, use commercial web-based 3D printing companies for a
professional service and much wider range of 3D printing materials.  </p>

How cool
does that sound? What does it mean?

Our ethos is about democratising 3D digital modelling, re-drawing the conventional boundaries by using a software/hardware system that gives you the user a very real sense of touch for a more natural way of working. You have the opportunity to put the ‘passion’ back into digital creativity and the creative freedom to stretch the scope of
your imagination. 
And the great news is that our software/hardware system, our Anarkik 3D Design package that Farah is using in the video, is up for a 3DPrintShow Global Award in the ‘Best Consumer Software’ category. This is fantastic and we are thrilled! 
(You can vote for us at this link: http://rki.lt/15znnRs as the award
is voted for by the public and is not a panel vote. And the award event is in London on 7th Nov 2013.)



Our campaign is about generating greater awareness of our Anarkik
3D Design package: it combines our creative software ‘Cloud9’ with a 3D haptic
device to give the real and powerful sensation of touch and feel to 3D modelling,
plus movement in 3D to more intuitively navigate in a virtual 3D work space.
Add to this the readily available 3D printing
facilities and your models can be transformed into real innovative customised
objects, all at a fraction of the cost not previously thought possible.
Why is this such
a powerful and valued concept?
Not only does Anarkik 3D Design software enable designer makers, artists and creative
enthusiasts to have full freedom of expression, applied arts and craft
businesses have a digital tool which can provide a distinctive edge and
differentiation because it supports working in 3D through more intuitive 3D interaction.
 After all it is more natural for
designers, artists and makers to think in 3D and work in 3D.



Image: ‘3D Consequences’ project : 4 designer makers using Anarkik
3D Design package and swopping designs through 3 iterations so each works on
another's model, resulting in 12 objects for 3D printing. The 4 are: Farah
Bandookwala, Elizabeth Armour, Ann Marie Shillito and newbie, Lucy
Robertson, who had little or no experience before this project of 3D modelling
and 3D printing.
The ability to create with touch and feel can
provide other major benefits: for example, offering challenges to heads and
hands is a key feature of the creative education process and can be part of
clinical therapy to aid recovery for cognitive, brain and stroke conditions.
Why are we
seeking your help?
We are making sales. We want to make more
sales to invest in development and
enable as many users as possible to benefit from the unique capabilities of our
product and access 3D printing. 
As with all innovatory products, building
market awareness and understanding is critical to stimulate interest. As we
have found from experience, 3D haptics is different and is something that most
people have not experienced. The only effective way to ""get"" the
experience and grasp the significance of touch for digital 3D designing is by a
hands-on demonstration.
The best way to achieve this is by being in
the market place. This means being at shows and exhibitions, giving hands-on
demonstrations and presentations. 



A major show coming up on 7-9 November is the
3DPrintShow in London. We need to be there and well manned for the full 3 days.
As a small business in this sector we cannot afford not to be there.  The cost to exhibit, present an illustrative
range of 3D printed models, for travel and accommodation, etc, for at least 4
people, and to produce the range of perks which we hope will attract you to
support us to do this, is £10000. If we can raise more, this can help us to
attend more shows and initiate fun, educational projects to spread the word and
awareness more extensively.

Can you,
will you help us?
If you would
like to support us and don’t want a perk your generous donation of £10 (Perk 1) will go even
further than you know in helping us towards our goal!
What we can
offer in return for donations is a range of great perks. Please scroll down for details and options on each perk:

(Anarkik 3D Design plus 3 day course for 1 or 2 people) (Perk 12).
* Ann Marie Shillito`s book,
“Digital Crafts : Industrial Technologies for applied artists and designer
makers” is about how designer makers are already accessing and using digital
technologies. The book is both inspirational, with 200 colour images of work,
and useful with information about the different technologies and what you need
to know to get access to them.
Background 
Anarkik 3D Design as a 3D modelling system grew out of founder
Ann Marie Shillito`s vision for a way of working and designing digitally in 3D,
more attuned to designer makers’ needs and methods of working,offering a way around the barriers
presented by traditional, standard computer aided design packages. Makers think
and do in 3D so Anarkik 3D Design works this way.





Image: Haptic - the sense of touch - how do you get across the
sensation of actually touching a virtual object other than physically
experiencing this?
It is this that is so special about Anarkik 3D Design: the use of
3D haptics and physically moving your hand in 3 dimensions, in x, y and z axes.
Haptics means 'touch' and a Falcon haptic device provides not only the
capability to touch and feel in 3D, to feel the process of modelling, shaping
and constructing,  you also more easily move
and navigate within your virtual 3D work space and ‘know’ where you are. This makes
Anarkik 3D Design very accessible, easy to learn and enjoyable to use. It looks
strange and the sensation is strange - but only for a very short
time because it taps into how we naturally interact with 3 dimensional
things in the real world.
Affordable, and easy to learn and use, Anarkik 3D Design offers the
means to produce unique, customised and innovatory items and jewellery.

composites, glass, plastics and even chocolate. 
As an example of what is possible, one of the most treasured
things that Ann Marie created is the wedding ring in titanium that her eldest
daughter Kari wanted so much, as featured below. The wedding ring and the
interlocking engagement ring were designed, in consultation with Kari, using our
Anarkik 3D Design software system, then prototypes were 3D printed to test for
fit, and finally the wedding ring was 3D printed in titanium.





How is this affordable?
Anarkik 3D Design costs £600 (approx $900/€700). This is a bundle
price for both software (Cloud9) and the Falcon haptic device and can be bought
from our company’s distributors or direct as a special offer from us only during
this crowdfunding project. 
You can also buy your own 3D printer – prices can be as low as
£700 – or as we also do, use commercial web-based 3D printing companies for a
professional service and much wider range of 3D printing materials.

<p>When you carry a 20 for Society product, you support the vision of socially responsible consumption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <b>every 20 for Society project is a Limited Edition item</b>. For our first project, we will only be selling<b> 5000</b> copies of Notebook20 worldwide, after which the same item/design will never be produced by us again.<br/></p>

<h3>*Who is the Beneficiary?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are not a charity fund raiser for any particular set of charities. 20
for Society is a social enterprise which adopts a revolutionary business model
of giving back 20% of the company’s sales to society.</p>
<p>We currently do not name the
specific beneficiary <u>before</u> the end of the project due
to strict requirements and overheads in Singapore on fund raising for certain
named charities. You can see how much funds we have raised through this Indiegogo campaign page, and verify the 20% give back to charity on our Website and Facebook page! <br/></p>
<p>We will also share snippets of our target beneficiaries.
For example, the Notebook20 project will see its 20% contribution go towards
helping children with cancer.</p>Please follow us on our <b><a href=""http://www.20forsociety.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a></b> and <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/20forsociety"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></strong>.
 Once each project
is completed, we will update the name of the beneficiary, and show you how your
support has made society a better place! We will also conduct periodic surveys
to get a better understanding of which communities you would like to see us
support.<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<p>We need your support to help us produce the Notebook20. With additional funds, we can prepare for more projects within this year.</p>Together, we can <b>show the world that a socially responsible business model is sustainable</b>, and take the first step in driving change  in consumerism.<p><br/></p>

In my free time I like to dabble with graphic design, photography and video composition which is why I have a subscription to the Creative Cloud suite.If you're an OSS fan, why not use OSS software?I do! I use Gimp, Inkscape, Audacity and many others on a regular basis. However, for complete projects I still prefer the Adobe suite, and there are many like me. For video editing I have not found a suitable alternative yet. It also doesn't help if clients or suppliers specifically ask for Adobe file formats.How did you make the movie?Using a Wacom tablet, Adobe Illustrator and After Effects. Running in Windows 7. Running inside KVM. On a Gentoo based KDE desktop.This is great, how can I help?Well, first of all by contributing to the campaign. If you are unable to help financially you can still help by spreading the word:

<p><strong>Exit Strategy Planner: A powerful daily planner to help you plan your escape from unfulfillment to pursue the career or business of your dreams.</strong></p>
<h2>HOW IT ALL STARTED</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597190573/enjxzqp8aclipzkntcm5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The idea to create the Exit Strategy Planner</strong> came shortly after I decided to make an exit plan to leave the practice of law for good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By way of background, all my life, I thought my dream was to become a lawyer but after my first semester of law school, I realized that becoming a lawyer wasn't my dream after all. I found practicing law unfulfilling and not a good fit for me. However, due to my fears of the unknown, fears of being perceived as a ""failure,"" and fears of not being able to pay off my student loans, I completed law school and began practicing law in New York City and New Jersey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I felt ""trapped"" in my career and began experiencing depression and anxiety. I realized I needed to make an exit plan and get out. <strong>I also learned a huge lesson: it's OKAY to start over.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After I decided that I would leave law for good, it didn’t take very long before I knew exactly what I wanted to do next. I wanted to create a tool that could help others, like me, escape unfulfillment to pursue their career or business dreams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I started doing research to understand how someone discovers work that adds meaning and fulfillment to their life. I also spent time studying how successful people increase their productivity and maximize their day to be more intentional with their time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After reading tons of books and listening to Ted-Talks from world-leading experts on these subjects, I learned that finding the right path requires deep self-evaluation, research, and gaining experience doing the thing you are interested in, so your next career or business pursuits are based on actual knowledge and experience, and not based on assumptions, biases, and expectations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The goal of the Exit Strategy Planner</strong> has always been simple: to create a tool that gives you <strong>clarity, confidence, and accountability</strong> as you take massive action toward your goals and dreams.</p>

<p>Let’s flash back to 2015.</p>
<p>David Demery was hobbled by a work-related injury but he still wanted to go out and play catch with his son. The thing was, 16-year-old Darien had a strong arm. Perhaps a little too strong. Eventually, Pops had to put down his glove and cut short the practice session. With his limited mobility and sore wrist, Demery thought to himself, ‘I’m done catching all these baseballs. And I’m sure as heck not going to run around and pick them all up.’</p>
<p>Light bulb. So the idea for the Cutoff Man was born.</p>
<p>Demery brought his concept to John Stirton, who helped with the development and design of the Cutoff Man. With the input and endorsement of 12-year MLB veteran Bip Roberts, the Cutoff Man is ready to help you get the most out of the daily grind, whether it’s baseball or softball.</p>
<p>The Cutoff Man by TeamMate Sports LLC helps make your practices more efficient than ever before. The lightweight frame houses a durable net that can handle all the throws from your infielders, outfielders, catchers and pitchers, before funneling the ball to a bucket at the base. Want to move it to another spot on the field? Easy, just lift it up by the handles and wheel it wherever you want to keep working. Fill up the bucket? Swap it out with an empty one. Boom.</p>
<p>With the Cutoff Man, you spend less time on logistics and more time teaching. Jobs that used to take two or three coaches only need one, helping you maximize your practice time and optimize your staff.</p>
<p>Currently used by the Triple-A affiliates of the San Francisco Giants (Sacramento River Cats) and the New York Mets (Las Vegas 51s), the Cutoff Man is valuable tool at all levels. From Little League to high school to college, the Cutoff Man helps players get more reps in less time.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have a come a long way since that fateful afternoon between father and son. But we still need your help to spread awareness and revolutionize the way we work on the diamond. By supporting the Cutoff Man, our Indiegogo contributors will help to realize these changes and be able to participate in this quest for improving players and the game.</p>
<p>We have a discount on our net, the big-ticket item. However, we have our own buckets (with logo), as well as baseballs and baseball cards.</p>

<h3>The Ultimate Thin Client</h3>
<p>Here is the ultimate Lapdock, crowdfunding starts at $100.</p>
<p>The Lapdock is a stable $100 Lapdock that can survive years of heavy usage, while users can upgrade the CPU, Memory, Connectivity, and other features by simply upgrading their Smartphone (which many people do every year or two anyway), or to be powered by an internal or external USB Type-C Stick (which has a fully functional PCB with CPU, Memory, etc but everything from Data, to Power and to Display running through the USB Type-C Port) or powered by a Development Board that feature some latest processor, memory, connectivity, ports and etc.</p>
</div><div>
<p>With at least $100K in orders. we can ship the Lapdock worldwide. If we don't reach that minimum goal, all backers will be refunded and thus you don't pay anything so don't worry.</p>
<p>The Lapdock currently works with Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+, Note 8, S9, S9+, Note 9, any other Samsung device that has Samsung Dex support. It also works fine with Huawei Mate 10, Mate 10 Pro, P20, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ7s9puKbn8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mate 20</a>, Mate 20 Pro, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LEPz_UuIpM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mate 20 X</a> and any other device with Huawei's PC Mode. It also works with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Smartisan+TNT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smartisan TNT based phones</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BQ+Aquaris+X2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BQ phones</a> (that we will be trying to source BQ X2 Acquarius phones running OXI Desktop UI see <a href=""http://getoxi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://getoxi.com</a>).</p>
<p>While Samsung and Huawei provide some great PC Mode Smartphones and Tablets already, we feel that the market is in need of some much cheaper PC Mode enabled Smartphones, Sticks, Development Boards and other devices, so we also aim to bring and to those cheaper options with this crowdfunding campaign such as the options linked here below.</p>
<p>The AmLogic S905X2 powered Type-C Stick runs Android (hopefully with OXI Desktop User Interface Mode). Which can be used with the Lapdock internally or externally.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 based USB Type-C Stick is also being promoted here for a powerful Type-C Stick that can use the open source Freedreno GPU driver for powerful and advanced Linux support. If Qualcomm and the supplier can provide Snapdragon 845/855 or even 8cx based USB Type-C Sticks, we will endeavor to also provide and to promote those on the market.</p>
<p>If any of these USB Type-C Stick projects don't get enough funding nor enough interest (probably that at least 1000 orders would be required to convince the supplier to design and to make them), or if we have any trouble in getting them made, don't worry any Type-C Stick orders will be fully refunded.</p>
<p>Starting at $110 we provide the Rock960 RK3399 Development Board with 4GB of RAM (in partnership with <a href=""http://vamrs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vamrs.com</a>) which can run either Android with OXI Desktop User Interface for PC Mode, or it can also run among several distributions of Linux such as Debian or Ubuntu.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We aim to revolutionize the PC and Laptop market. To change the way ARM Powered Smartphones, Sticks and Development Boards can be used for serious productivity throughout the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch goals are following:</strong></h3>
<p>- The more orders there may be, the higher quality displays, keyboard, mouse pad and the higher quality batteries for longest possible battery length can we sourced.</p>
<p>- The more orders there may be, the higher complexity the main Lapdock PCB will have. Certain stretch goals in mind can be a switch and a Wi-Fi module on the PCB to enable Miracast wireless Lapdock mode, engineering to easily power any external development board, an HDMI input port directly on the side or on the back of the Lapdock mold (to not require that HDMI input to USB Type-C Display port adapter), more USB3 bandwidth host ports, a full size SD card slot with also high bandwidth supported, an intergrated Gigabit Ethernet port would also be great to include.</p>
<p>- The more orders there may be, we would endeavor to distribute the Lapdocks through European and US based warehousing logistics which would enable us to reduce the shipping price. In exchange some bonus accessories might be included for those who placed early orders with the higher shipping price. Consider the currently high shipping price takes into account DHL based shipping from China to the whole world, considering the Lapdock ships with a built-in Lithium-Ion battery which is harder and more expensive to ship by air.</p>
<p>- The more successful the Lapdock orders might be, would enable us to push for more and better USB Type-C Sticks to be available, and we would even also be able to push the industry to bring more and better Smartphones that have stronger and better PC Modes supported in them. Possibly we could be launching some approx $200 Smartphones running off MediaTek chipsets or Qualcomm chipsets with good performance but affordable PC Mode supported. To help push the whole industry to adopt PC Mode functionality over the USB Type-C port as the industry standard for every new smartphone from the most entry level to high end.</p>
<p>- In the future, once Lapdocks are very popular, I can imagine that one could be made with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Charbax/search?query=Pixel+Qi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pixel Qi display</a>, or with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Charbax/search?query=CLEARink"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CLEARink display</a> or with even an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF1b3qgw-K4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">E Ink display</a>, to enable 50+ hour battery length on such a Lapdock, with sunlight readability, perhaps also that Lapdocks can come with a touchscreen display too (as with the Lapscreen project) for people who want to be using a Tablet like device also in productivity mode.</p>
<p>- If the Lapdock project becomes very popular, we will approach <a href=""http://Shadow.tech"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://Shadow.tech</a> to see if they would like to provide a free month's trial of their amazing cloud PC service for every new Lapdock user so users can be running apps and games on their Lapdock over the cloud that require very high performance. We expect Shadow to have excellent Android and Linux client apps supported with good stable keyboard and mouse inputs by the time the Lapdock starts shipping.</p>
<p>- If too few users request a specific color for the Lapdock for it to be justified to make it in that color, then backers of that color will be asked if they don't mind receiving the Lapdock in another more popular color.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We cannot provide as high quality as big brands like Lenovo or HP. They make great laptop keyboards, but we aim to be good enough for most demanding users to be quite satisfied with the quality. We work hard to provide a decent display, keyboard and mouse pad that we hope users will be happy using extensively.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread this campaign on your blogs, twitter, facebook and more.</p>
<p>There is soon going to be a support forum where people enthusiastic about this project also can discuss about feature requests for the Lapdock project at <a href=""http://Lapdock.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://Lapdock.net</a></p>

While Samsung and Huawei provide some great PC Mode Smartphones and Tablets already, we feel that the market is in need of some much cheaper PC Mode enabled Smartphones, Sticks, Development Boards and other devices, so we also aim to bring and to those cheaper options with this crowdfunding campaign such as the options linked here below.
The AmLogic S905X2 powered Type-C Stick runs Android (hopefully with OXI Desktop User Interface Mode). Which can be used with the Lapdock internally or externally.
The Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 based USB Type-C Stick is also being promoted here for a powerful Type-C Stick that can use the open source Freedreno GPU driver for powerful and advanced Linux support. If Qualcomm and the supplier can provide Snapdragon 845/855 or even 8cx based USB Type-C Sticks, we will endeavor to also provide and to promote those on the market.
If any of these USB Type-C Stick projects don't get enough funding nor enough interest (probably that at least 1000 orders would be required to convince the supplier to design and to make them), or if we have any trouble in getting them made, don't worry any Type-C Stick orders will be fully refunded.
Starting at $110 we provide the Rock960 RK3399 Development Board with 4GB of RAM (in partnership with http://vamrs.com) which can run either Android with OXI Desktop User Interface for PC Mode, or it can also run among several distributions of Linux such as Debian or Ubuntu.

The Impact
We aim to revolutionize the PC and Laptop market. To change the way ARM Powered Smartphones, Sticks and Development Boards can be used for serious productivity throughout the world.
Stretch goals are following:
- The more orders there may be, the higher quality displays, keyboard, mouse pad and the higher quality batteries for longest possible battery length can we sourced.
- The more orders there may be, the higher complexity the main Lapdock PCB will have. Certain stretch goals in mind can be a switch and a Wi-Fi module on the PCB to enable Miracast wireless Lapdock mode, engineering to easily power any external development board, an HDMI input port directly on the side or on the back of the Lapdock mold (to not require that HDMI input to USB Type-C Display port adapter), more USB3 bandwidth host ports, a full size SD card slot with also high bandwidth supported, an intergrated Gigabit Ethernet port would also be great to include.
- The more orders there may be, we would endeavor to distribute the Lapdocks through European and US based warehousing logistics which would enable us to reduce the shipping price. In exchange some bonus accessories might be included for those who placed early orders with the higher shipping price. Consider the currently high shipping price takes into account DHL based shipping from China to the whole world, considering the Lapdock ships with a built-in Lithium-Ion battery which is harder and more expensive to ship by air.
- The more successful the Lapdock orders might be, would enable us to push for more and better USB Type-C Sticks to be available, and we would even also be able to push the industry to bring more and better Smartphones that have stronger and better PC Modes supported in them. Possibly we could be launching some approx $200 Smartphones running off MediaTek chipsets or Qualcomm chipsets with good performance but affordable PC Mode supported. To help push the whole industry to adopt PC Mode functionality over the USB Type-C port as the industry standard for every new smartphone from the most entry level to high end.
- In the future, once Lapdocks are very popular, I can imagine that one could be made with a Pixel Qi display, or with a CLEARink display or with even an E Ink display, to enable 50+ hour battery length on such a Lapdock, with sunlight readability, perhaps also that Lapdocks can come with a touchscreen display too (as with the Lapscreen project) for people who want to be using a Tablet like device also in productivity mode.
- If the Lapdock project becomes very popular, we will approach http://Shadow.tech to see if they would like to provide a free month's trial of their amazing cloud PC service for every new Lapdock user so users can be running apps and games on their Lapdock over the cloud that require very high performance. We expect Shadow to have excellent Android and Linux client apps supported with good stable keyboard and mouse inputs by the time the Lapdock starts shipping.
- If too few users request a specific color for the Lapdock for it to be justified to make it in that color, then backers of that color will be asked if they don't mind receiving the Lapdock in another more popular color.

Risks & Challenges
We cannot provide as high quality as big brands like Lenovo or HP. They make great laptop keyboards, but we aim to be good enough for most demanding users to be quite satisfied with the quality. We work hard to provide a decent display, keyboard and mouse pad that we hope users will be happy using extensively.

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is a Calou?</b><br/></p>
<p>The Calou is a digital wall calendar based on Android functions with e-Paper display – and with that the first ever smart calendar!<br/><br/>It can be synchronized via Wi-Fi with an iPhone or Android smart phone and sets up all of your dates and appointments in a unified and clear manner. It’s a digital wall calendar featuring an Internet connection.</p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Smart Calendar for iPhone &amp; Google</b><br/></p>
The Calou is the world's first digital wall calendar for both iPhone and Android! It supports both calendar systems simultaneously and is mounted on the wall just like a normal paper-based wall calendar.<br/><br/>And that’s exactly how it functions too: All of your dates and appointments are clearly presented next to each other in columns. Every device is represented by a column.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1319231/files/20150323141142-Schema_Spalten_und_Devices_2-200dpi.jpg?1427145102"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
The days of writing down appointments in a calendar are a thing of the past! Be automatically up-to-date!<br/><br/>In addition to their electronic iPhone or Google calendars, many smart phone users have a paper calendar hanging on the wall at home. In everyday use, this means that all dates and appointments have to be entered per hand in writing and then checked every now and again, if not daily.<br/><br/><p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1319253/files/20150323141641-calou_und_alle_apps_u_devices_200dpi.jpg?1427145401"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p></p>
<br/><p>Thanks to the Calou, there’s no more crossing out or erasing things! The device automatically synchronizes itself with all possible digital calendars and smart phones, and then shows the calendar contents in a central manner and location. It’s simple and lucid, regardless of whether you use an iPhone/Android, a tablet PC or a computer. The registered calendar accounts are called up per Wi-Fi by the Calou, which then displays all of the dates and appointment entries bundled up together on its e-Paper display.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>iCloud and Google side-by-side</b> <br/></p>
<p>Every device or, said differently, every digital calendar account has an individual column, as is the case in a traditional wall calendar. As such, every user has his or her column in which his or her dates and appointments are entered.<br/>For just about the first time ever, Apple iCloud or Google Calendar Accounts can be viewed and processed or worked on at the same time.<br/>All calendar accounts will remain completely separate and independent of each other. No calendar has to be released or shared. Only the respective calendar/account owner knows his or her own password.<br/>Every calendar account in the Calou device is technically its own autonomous entity and the unwanted use by a third party can be individually protected with an additional password.</p>
<p><b>Information headquarters</b>
</p>
<p>The Calou is attached to the wall much like your typical paper calendar. With that, you’ll always have all your appointments available at a mere glance. The Calou is also a magnetic board to which you can attach paper notes, post cards, or whatever else you would like.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1317368/files/20150323031126-calou-front-freigestellt_v1.1.jpg?1427105486"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>The encasement is made completely of wood and fits perfectly in the selected environment. This allows the Calou to become THE information headquarters at home where all things come together. </p>

</p>
<p><b>e-Paper display and touch screen</b>
</p>
The Calou is operated simply and intuitively by hand via its touch screen. Appointments or changes can be done spontaneously and per hand directly on the Calou. There’s no searching around your smart phone, no uploading your computer, no need to log in – the Calou is always on and your appointments are permanently visible.<br/><br/>The display looks like electronic paper, much like the type found in an eBook reader. It uses so little electricity that you can ultimately use the device for weeks without recharging the rechargeable battery or putting in another load of batteries.

As such, no fixed electricity connection is necessary. The Calou runs on typical AA (mignon) batteries that are placed in a compartment on the backside of the device. If the batteries or rechargeable batteries are empty, simply turn around the device and switch them out per hand.<br/><br/>The Calou disposes of a micro-USB 2.0 connection for data and the electricity supply. It can also be continually connected to a power source via the USB connection, if you don’t want to operate it with batteries.

Android 4.4 is the operating system that runs on the Calou. The Android platform grants you access to the Google Play Store and all of the apps that can be selected there! As such, you can actually call up your e-mail, listen to music or Internet radio via the internal speakers, surf the net per browser, and install other useful apps such as Dropbox, Evernote, and co.<br/><br/><p><b>Your own apps</b>
</p>
On the Calou’s Android platform, you can run and operate your own self-developed apps. You can develop special apps for your Calou and make it even better.

<p>The Calou is round  and made of wood. Thanks to its minimalistic design, it perfectly and easily fits in its local environment, even giving the setting sublime accent.The front side features a varnished metal surface: It can be used for post cards or post-it notes that can be hung by small magnets.</p>

<p>The Calou masters a number of different calendar presentations in order to always provide an optimal overview of things. There’s a task bar on the lower edge of the screen for switching between options. In addition, you can always directly press on the date of a day or on the week number in order to directly switch to the desired period of time or date.

<b>Daily overview:</b> An overview of an entire day. The first line lists all of the full day dates.


By clicking on a cell in a calendar column, you directly receive a short
 overview of the selected day without switching over to the daily view.<br/><br/> <b>Priority:</b> A specialty feature of the Calou is the priority function. In the monthly overview, two dates per day are displayed together with a symbol that indicates how many additional dates or appointments are left in a specific day. With the priority selection box in the daily view section and in the new appointment dialogue, you can determine which two appointments should directly receive priority and “stand ahead” in the monthly viewpoint.

<b>Hide the columns:</b> <br/>By clicking on the name above the column, you can push the columns together to get more space and a better overview. As such, you can ‘hide’ all columns except for one to get a better sole overview of whatever it is you’d like to focus on. One more click back and the columns open up again.

<br/> <b>Selecting days or weeks:</b> In order to switch back and forth between the various viewpoints and appointments as quickly as possible, you can always click directly on one day or one calendar week. Then you switch the presentation directly to the daily or weekly overview.

<a name=""procedure"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a>
<p><b>THE CROWDFUNDING PROCEDURE: </b></p>
<p>There is a fixed, determined runtime and a target amount that has to be reached. The Crowdfunding campaign is first considered a success if we reach the target amount within a runtime of 30 days. The target amount has been set to the minimal amount necessary for a payable series production.

<br/><br/>

The Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo will collect all of your payments centrally. We ourselves do not initially receive any money. If enough supporters come together within 30 days and we achieve or exceed the target amount, the campaign will be deemed a success. In this case, we’ll be given your payments at the end of the campaign minus the Indiegogo and PayPal fees. The series production can begin and the Calou will be on its way!

<br/><br/>

If we can’t get enough supporters together and we don’t reach our target goal within 30 days, the campaign will automatically be reversed by Indiegogo. You’ll automatically get the full payments you made returned back to your PayPal account. In this case, we’d not be able to place the Calou into series production. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>Things that can help us</b><br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Spread the word: Inform as many people as possible. Only when enough supporters join in the cause will we be able to build the Calou.</li>
<li> Even a small donation will help: Each and every one of us can add to the cause with a donation of our own choice and this will bring us closer to success.</li>
<li> Do you want a Calou? Don’t bother waiting, just get it now! If you wait, we’re going to fail and then there won’t be any Calous to buy later in the store.</li>
<li> Don’t wait to see how the campaign develops: If we don’t achieve our goal, you’ll automatically get your money back. An early participation is not a disadvantage. Just the opposite! Campaigns that start off strongly grab more attention and interested parties, and the chances for success increase.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p><b> How many calendar accounts can be administrated? </b></p>
<p><b> How many calendar accounts can be displayed simultaneously? </b></p>
<p> The Calou can administrate an almost unlimited amount of calendar accounts. However, due to the size of the display, a maximum of 4 columns can be displayed at one time.</p>
<p><b> Is it possible to have several Google calendars displayed in one calendar column?</b></p>
<p><b> What do the columns look like when you administrate several calendars with Google calendar?</b></p>

<p><span><b>POSSIBLE  RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES - THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND</b></span></p>
<p>We have been working for no less than two years in developing and perfecting this product, however there will always be improvements and innovations. We hope many will include aspects of your feedback. By pledging to support this innovation, you are doing so with the understanding that you are making this new product happen - allowing cutting edge technology to be realized.</p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b> We are working closely with an experienced manufacturer who has been able to produce state of the art electronic devices at a high level of quality, so we have already resolved some of the manufacturing challenges. However in order to be able to produce on a larger scale, we will require increased tooling and production equipment. This could lead to a bit of delay. <br/></p>
<p><b>FULFILMENT: </b>Despite our best planning efforts, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunctions, transportation disturbances or supplier delays. While we hope that your support at Indiegogo will enable us to begin production on a commercial scale, we have no idea as to whether it will be 'business as usual' for us or an overwhelming demand. If more people than we anticipate would like to get their hands on a Calou, we may have to upscale the production. We will endeavour to produce the product quickly.</p>
<p><b>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS:</b> Extensive testing of the latest prototype has taken place throughout recent months and we think we have a product that is market-ready. However, adjustments may be made along the way (as we can’t think of everything in advance). This will result in a better product, but may delay production or shipment in some cases.</p>

(Der Text dieser Kampagne auf Deutsch)


What is a Calou?
The Calou is a digital wall calendar based on Android functions with e-Paper display – and with that the first ever smart calendar!It can be synchronized via Wi-Fi with an iPhone or Android smart phone and sets up all of your dates and appointments in a unified and clear manner. It’s a digital wall calendar featuring an Internet connection.

Smart Calendar for iPhone & Google
The Calou is the world's first digital wall calendar for both iPhone and Android! It supports both calendar systems simultaneously and is mounted on the wall just like a normal paper-based wall calendar.And that’s exactly how it functions too: All of your dates and appointments are clearly presented next to each other in columns. Every device is represented by a column.

_____
Automatically up-to-date




The days of writing down appointments in a calendar are a thing of the past! Be automatically up-to-date!In addition to their electronic iPhone or Google calendars, many smart phone users have a paper calendar hanging on the wall at home. In everyday use, this means that all dates and appointments have to be entered per hand in writing and then checked every now and again, if not daily.


Thanks to the Calou, there’s no more crossing out or erasing things! The device automatically synchronizes itself with all possible digital calendars and smart phones, and then shows the calendar contents in a central manner and location. It’s simple and lucid, regardless of whether you use an iPhone/Android, a tablet PC or a computer. The registered calendar accounts are called up per Wi-Fi by the Calou, which then displays all of the dates and appointment entries bundled up together on its e-Paper display.

Back to the top of the page




iCloud and Google side-by-side 
Every device or, said differently, every digital calendar account has an individual column, as is the case in a traditional wall calendar. As such, every user has his or her column in which his or her dates and appointments are entered.For just about the first time ever, Apple iCloud or Google Calendar Accounts can be viewed and processed or worked on at the same time.All calendar accounts will remain completely separate and independent of each other. No calendar has to be released or shared. Only the respective calendar/account owner knows his or her own password.Every calendar account in the Calou device is technically its own autonomous entity and the unwanted use by a third party can be individually protected with an additional password.
Information headquarters

The Calou is attached to the wall much like your typical paper calendar. With that, you’ll always have all your appointments available at a mere glance. The Calou is also a magnetic board to which you can attach paper notes, post cards, or whatever else you would like.

The encasement is made completely of wood and fits perfectly in the selected environment. This allows the Calou to become THE information headquarters at home where all things come together.

e-Paper display and touch screen

The Calou is operated simply and intuitively by hand via its touch screen. Appointments or changes can be done spontaneously and per hand directly on the Calou. There’s no searching around your smart phone, no uploading your computer, no need to log in – the Calou is always on and your appointments are permanently visible.The display looks like electronic paper, much like the type found in an eBook reader. It uses so little electricity that you can ultimately use the device for weeks without recharging the rechargeable battery or putting in another load of batteries.



As such, no fixed electricity connection is necessary. The Calou runs on typical AA (mignon) batteries that are placed in a compartment on the backside of the device. If the batteries or rechargeable batteries are empty, simply turn around the device and switch them out per hand.The Calou disposes of a micro-USB 2.0 connection for data and the electricity supply. It can also be continually connected to a power source via the USB connection, if you don’t want to operate it with batteries.

Android



Android 4.4 is the operating system that runs on the Calou. The Android platform grants you access to the Google Play Store and all of the apps that can be selected there! As such, you can actually call up your e-mail, listen to music or Internet radio via the internal speakers, surf the net per browser, and install other useful apps such as Dropbox, Evernote, and co.Your own apps

On the Calou’s Android platform, you can run and operate your own self-developed apps. You can develop special apps for your Calou and make it even better.

The Design

The Calou is round  and made of wood. Thanks to its minimalistic design, it perfectly and easily fits in its local environment, even giving the setting sublime accent.The front side features a varnished metal surface: It can be used for post cards or post-it notes that can be hung by small magnets.



In a wooden garment: The encasement is made of Multiplex.

The Calendar 
The Calou masters a number of different calendar presentations in order to always provide an optimal overview of things. There’s a task bar on the lower edge of the screen for switching between options. In addition, you can always directly press on the date of a day or on the week number in order to directly switch to the desired period of time or date.




Monthly overview: The most typical function of the Calou is the monthly view presented in a column format with the complete overview of all dates, appointments, and users on one side.












Weekly overview: If you want an overview of the current week, you switch to the weekly overview.














3 Days: For even more details, you can call up the following three days entirely onto the screen.















Daily overview: An overview of an entire day. The first line lists all of the full day dates.


By clicking on a cell in a calendar column, you directly receive a short
 overview of the selected day without switching over to the daily view. Priority: A specialty feature of the Calou is the priority function. In the monthly overview, two dates per day are displayed together with a symbol that indicates how many additional dates or appointments are left in a specific day. With the priority selection box in the daily view section and in the new appointment dialogue, you can determine which two appointments should directly receive priority and “stand ahead” in the monthly viewpoint. 




Between the years – The Yearly Overview: In order to be able to jump quickly between far-removed time intervals in the calendar, there’s the yearly overview. Here you can directly click on a day, a calendar week or a month and the display jumps to the selected point in time.












Hide the columns: By clicking on the name above the column, you can push the columns together to get more space and a better overview. As such, you can ‘hide’ all columns except for one to get a better sole overview of whatever it is you’d like to focus on. One more click back and the columns open up again.

 Selecting days or weeks: In order to switch back and forth between the various viewpoints and appointments as quickly as possible, you can always click directly on one day or one calendar week. Then you switch the presentation directly to the daily or weekly overview.




By clicking on a cell in a calendar column, you directly receive a short overview of the selected day without switching over to the daily view.







A new date: A new date can be directly entered in the Calou by clicking on a daily box or on the ""New"" key in the task bar.
Very recognizable in the picture on the right is the priority selection box, which is used to determine whether the date/appointment should be presented directly in the monthly view.

THE CROWDFUNDING PROCEDURE: 
There is a fixed, determined runtime and a target amount that has to be reached. The Crowdfunding campaign is first considered a success if we reach the target amount within a runtime of 30 days. The target amount has been set to the minimal amount necessary for a payable series production.



The Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo will collect all of your payments centrally. We ourselves do not initially receive any money. If enough supporters come together within 30 days and we achieve or exceed the target amount, the campaign will be deemed a success. In this case, we’ll be given your payments at the end of the campaign minus the Indiegogo and PayPal fees. The series production can begin and the Calou will be on its way!



If we can’t get enough supporters together and we don’t reach our target goal within 30 days, the campaign will automatically be reversed by Indiegogo. You’ll automatically get the full payments you made returned back to your PayPal account. In this case, we’d not be able to place the Calou into series production. 

Things that can help us


 Spread the word: Inform as many people as possible. Only when enough supporters join in the cause will we be able to build the Calou.
 Even a small donation will help: Each and every one of us can add to the cause with a donation of our own choice and this will bring us closer to success.
 Do you want a Calou? Don’t bother waiting, just get it now! If you wait, we’re going to fail and then there won’t be any Calous to buy later in the store.
 Don’t wait to see how the campaign develops: If we don’t achieve our goal, you’ll automatically get your money back. An early participation is not a disadvantage. Just the opposite! Campaigns that start off strongly grab more attention and interested parties, and the chances for success increase.


What won’t help

 “I’ll wait a bit and get it later in the store”. We won’t make it with this attitude and then the Calou won’t be available in a store later.
 “Let the others do it. I don’t like to do much posting or advertising”. We can only do this together with our combined efforts. We don’t have any advertising or marketing budget. If the information isn’t passed along, shared and posted by every individual, we won’t stand a chance.
 “I’ll wait and see how things go. Then I’ll join later”: There is no disadvantage to being along for the ride right from the get go. Should we fail in our endeavor, you’ll get your money back anyway. A weak start will make it very difficult to have any success.

 Is it possible to have several Google calendars displayed in one calendar column?
 What do the columns look like when you administrate several calendars with Google calendar?
 Are shared Google calendars displayed in the respective column? 
 Can you choose which Google sub-calendar or shared calendar is displayed and which isn‘t?
 Yes, all shared calendars and sub-calendars can be displayed in one column. The user can select whether only the main calendar or even all other calendars are displayed. All shared calendars and sub-calendars can be blended in or out at once. A selective choice of the individual sub-calendars is not currently possible.
 Can you also use the calendar horizontally (landscape)? 
 At the moment, the Calou only works in a vertical format (portrait). As part of the coming, charge-free software updates, a horizontal/landscape format presentation is also planned.
 Does the Calou also support CalDav, Microsoft Exchange, and the Live Calendar from Microsoft?
 At the current time, the Calou only supports Google Calendar and Apple iCloud calendar accounts. For the delivery of the first series models after the Crowdfunding is however there is a software update planed with CalDAV, Exchange, and Live Support.
 In what colors can I get the Calou?
 At the current time, we only deliver the den Calou in the color white.
 Are other designs and encasement forms planned?
 Not at the current moment.
 Can you get the Calou with a larger display?
 Larger displays are unfortunately not available on the market for series production at the current moment.
 How can you enter something by hand? Is a pen/stylus required? 
 The Calou is operated by the touch of a finger. A pen/stylus is not necessary.
Does the Calou require an electrical connection?
No, the Calou runs with 4 AA (mignon) batteries or rechargeable batteries, but can be continually connected to a general household electricity socket via a USB cable.
Data security: Is my data and information safe in the Calou?
The Calou only shows data and information that you have already entered in your Cloud – Google or iCloud. Other external databases are not made use of. Your Google or iCloud appointments are only stored in your Calou. We have not access to your data or information.
How long does the Calou run with one load of batteries?
Battery consumption very much depends on the usage and frequency of the synchronization. At a rate of two synchronizations per day with only but a few entries/display alterations, a set of batteries can last for roughly 10-14 days
Where can I get replacement storage batteries?
The Calou functions with common AA (mignon) batteries that are available in every supermarket.
Will there be software updates?
We are planning on regularly releasing online updates so that you can update your device directly online.
Why can’t I just buy the Calou in a store or web-shop?
We haven't yet started with series production. As such, the Calou can only be pre-ordered exclusively via this Crowdfunding campaign.

POSSIBLE  RISKS & CHALLENGES - THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND
We have been working for no less than two years in developing and perfecting this product, however there will always be improvements and innovations. We hope many will include aspects of your feedback. By pledging to support this innovation, you are doing so with the understanding that you are making this new product happen - allowing cutting edge technology to be realized.
MANUFACTURING: We are working closely with an experienced manufacturer who has been able to produce state of the art electronic devices at a high level of quality, so we have already resolved some of the manufacturing challenges. However in order to be able to produce on a larger scale, we will require increased tooling and production equipment. This could lead to a bit of delay. 
FULFILMENT: Despite our best planning efforts, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunctions, transportation disturbances or supplier delays. While we hope that your support at Indiegogo will enable us to begin production on a commercial scale, we have no idea as to whether it will be 'business as usual' for us or an overwhelming demand. If more people than we anticipate would like to get their hands on a Calou, we may have to upscale the production. We will endeavour to produce the product quickly.
PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: Extensive testing of the latest prototype has taken place throughout recent months and we think we have a product that is market-ready. However, adjustments may be made along the way (as we can’t think of everything in advance). This will result in a better product, but may delay production or shipment in some cases.

<p>Our first game, Farting Frenchies has continued to be a great success and since launching the initiative June, <strong>we've donated 1,600 games</strong> to kids in hospitals <strong>across the country!</strong><br/> </p>
<h2>The new game that has everyone laughing</h2>
<p>Our second game, Beware of Bears is continuing our mission to make people laugh!</p>
<p>Beware of Bears is an exciting fast-paced card game where players fight to sabotage and eliminate each other while watching out for... bears! Defeat your friends and make your path to victory before you end up in a bear's stomach! ??</p>
<p>The more you progress through the game, the crazier it gets with lava, evil squirrels, yummy donuts, and best of all, scary bears! Beware of Bears is a super strategic, family friendly, fast paced, 20-30 minute game that will keep you laughing... and running for your life!<br/> </p>

<br/>Beware of Bears Origin Story</h3>
<p>It all came from a trip... to the woods. We live in CT, pretty far from bear country, so when we went for a hike one day and came upon a “Beware of Bears” sign we were surprised...aaaand had a good laugh...See, one member of the family, who shall remain nameless, (pssst rhymes with icky) has a habit of falling into haaaaiiiry situations while on trips. We all laughed that chances are he’d be the one to get caught by a bear. </p>
<p>The backstory: rewind to 2017 when we went on a trip to L.A. to film for Shark Tank. The day before we went on set, Mickey took a tumble off an electric scooter, got four stitches and two fractured wrists! After insisting he was fiiiiine, (Brave kid!) the very next day Mickey went head-to-head with nature again- a SHARK named Mr. Wonderful! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1634832051/taulrsz6v023euq7gqd5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Fast forward to 2019; we’re on a trip, yet again, and Mickey gets stung by the third most dangerous jellyfish in the world-- a Portugese Man O War, aaaand, thank goodness, lives to tell the tale. See, nature and trips do not end well for Mickey!</p>
<p>So that’s why we had a good laugh...aaanand spent the rest of the hike talking about how it would make a hilarious game! We went home and immediately created the game. That game is 98% the exact same game to this day.</p>
<p>That infamous day:</p>

A sinister bargain has caused suffering for the people of the land and has created a mad witch-knight hungering for revenge.The adventure is partially set in Aglarion, a blossoming kingdom where all intelligent races are part of society and live in tolerance. This means that players can choose to play exotic monstrous races and still function effectively throughout the adventure.  Download the 10-page Adventure Summary booklet to learn every detail of the complete campaign background and the storyline of each chapter. SPOILER ALERT! The summary contains massive amounts of spoilers, so don’t read it unless you plan to be the GM for this adventure module.Krasnar Azennar, aberration infused lich-knight heir to the crown Crown of the Oathbreaker is based on an elaborate survey, which had over 2000 responses from dedicated RPG fans. We took the results and created an intricately woven story that incorporates every element of the desired aspects of a great adventure as decided by the community. Thank you again if you took part in this communal effort!You can still fill out the survey if you missed it. Your votes could shift the adventure in new directions.    Caress of the Elderbrain Based on the survey results, Crown of the Oathbreaker is a mix between sandbox and classic storylines, with a healthy blend of combat and non-combat encounters for all types of gameplay. It also combines elements of both high and dark fantasy, resulting in a singular style. Our approach was to come up with unique twists on classic features for every game aspect that was covered in the survey.Here are some of the major pillars of the adventure, as decided by the voting: The adventure takes the players to the three most favored planar settings: the Feyrealm, the Shadowrealm, and Hell. From 1 (I don't like it) to 4 (I love it) the result is clear, so the adventure features a combination of several intricately woven sandbox settings connected with some short linear storylines. The archvillain is a complex recurring enemy - a hexblade oathbreaker paladin infused with the power of an entity from the far realms who eventually becomes a lich-knight. Download the complete evaluation of the survey results to see how the responses to each section shaped the final adventure. The adventure and the campaign setting are also influenced by our community through our Discord server.  Join the discussion, add your thoughts, check out the latest content, and merge your intellect with the Elderbrain! We think everyone would agree that the quality of the finished product is paramount for both content and design.

We have always wanted to create shiny RPG products, which we can call our own, so we launched the Elderbrain.com site and have recently released our first D&D product, “Year of Rogue Dragons”, a 100-page adventure module for evil dragon characters set in the Forgotten Realms, which quickly became a platinum seller on DMsGuild.It was an amazing experience to hold our own printed hardcover adventure module in our hands. The pdf version was purchased by over 1500 like-minded fans, who gave feedback, support, and so much love.We didn’t want to stop there. So we rolled up our sleeves to create this project, and we hope you will share our excitement! Authors Gabor (Geek 6/Game Dev 4/Manager 6) has molten dice flowing in his veins. His most frequently used feats are: Get Things Done, Motivate Others, Create From Nothing. He has been GMing and playing RPGs for over 30 years and creates computer games for a living.   Tom (Geek 6/Historian 4/Manager 6) devours fantasy, history, and sci-fi books for breakfast, or really anytime he has a few minutes to read. His most frequently used feats are: Midas Touch, Satisfy Partners, Locate Anyone/Anything. He is a dedicated GM and RPG enthusiast and does business development in the computer gaming industry using his research background as a medieval historian.   David (Geek 6/Corp. Executive 13) fiddles with a D20 and dreams of dragons and dungeons after his top-level executive meetings in his office. He balances random encounters versus party levels in his head as he pushes the stroller in the park. It is his lifelong wish to become a successful RPG publisher. So let's help Dave fulfill his dreams! His fate depends on you... Illustrators Zsolt, David and Gergő are some of the most talented illustrators we have ever met during our extensive experience of working with professional artists and they collaborated on our previous module as well. They usually work for big international gaming brands but we all hope that we can keep them busy for a long time with a successful campaign.David: https://www.artstation.com/davidszaboartZsolt: https://www.artstation.com/zsoltkosaGergő: https://www.artstation.com/qbrt-cubeart The Matrons of Malice perform the dark ritual on the crown as Krasnar's body is burned on a pyre built from the hag-tree as the ghost of King Dasmag sings his lament The total budget is planned to be allocated to cover illustrations and designs, creating soundscapes, and of course those unfortunate taxes and fees. We do all the writing, which we enjoy doing a lot. Of course, we wouldn't mind making some money on the project if the campaign blew up, but as illustration costs are quite high, we expect that our main reward will be the realization of the product, which is a fantastic result for us in itself.Based on our experience with our first module, and keeping in mind that Crown of the Oathbreaker is a more ambitious project and several times longer, we expect to finish the core product by the end of 2021. The edited pdf version of the product should be available by December. The printing takes two additional months and it will probably take another month for the freight company to deliver our products to our US warehouse from the manufacturer. This means that the hardcover version and the booster cards will be available probably by March-April 2022. A melancholic Despair Giant of the Shadowrealm  Delivery of digital productsAll digital products will be sent via email.Delivery of physical productsPrinting costs are not included in any of the listed perks but will have to be paid directly at Elderbrain.com when ordering your physical products (book and/or cards) with the discount code in the value of your pledge, which we will send you via email.We charge printing costs later because we started out by offering a DriveThruRPG print-on-demand solution to deliver the physical products but we realized that we can achieve a lower production cost and better quality by doing everything ourselves. With this, we would cut the price of the now almost 600-page book to one-third of its previous price.  We have researched the best manufacturer, freight company, and fulfillment service provider we could find to accomplish this.We expect the module to be about 550-600 pages long and we will prepare the print files for the 8.5” x 11” large print format. The hardcover book will be sewn bound and printed on 128 gsm paper. The printing costs of the final hardcover book will be +$25 and it will be +$12 for the two booster card decks (packed in a neat combo box). These are the extra costs that you will have to pay for the physical products above the value of your pledge.  Shipping costs are also not included in any of the listed prices, they will be added to your order at Elderbrain.com when ordering your physical product.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

Preview Barry Doublet - Board Games Everybody Should...

Preview The Hungy Gamer
Preview Vin d'jeu (French) Preview Nox Spellenzolder (Dutch)Want to read the rulebook? This isn't in final layout yet, but already complete. If you want to learn more about the setup, also check the setup-guide. With the print & play you can take a look at al the cardboard components and cards. This way you can check all abilities of the aliens, exiled forces and warp guardians or the mission cards in the game.We only have to add the solo mode that will follow later. You can find more information about the solo mode in this thread. We offer 3 options.
Basic pledge: You receive the base game (1-4 players), all stretch goals and the Kickstarter Exclusive aliens.
Full pledge: You receive the base game (1-4 players), the expansion ( 5-6 players), all stretch goals and the Kickstarter Exclusive alien.
 Group pledge: Minimum 3 copies of the base game. You can add additional copies of the base game or the expansion to this group pledge You receive a discount and this option offers heavily reduced shipping.
Keep in mind, the final design and colors of the components can still be optimized during the final editing process.All of the above will be included in the base version of the game (1-4 players). If you want the full experience up to 6 players you can also add the expansion to your order. This will contain the following:You can add an add-on to your pledge by increasing the amount of your pledge with the price of the add-on. You can use the pledged amount in the pledge manager when the campaign ends to add the add-on to your order. Adding an add-on doesn't increase the shipping cost. Click the image below for more information. 2 extra aliens will follow as soon as the sketches are ready.This add-on pack will include:
6 player aliens cards
6 new exiled forces (printed on the back)
6 new warp guardians cards
In total you’ll receive 12 cards in 120*80mm format. All stretch goals are in euro.7002 CE. It’s been five years since a mysterious cataclysm destroyed several colonies on the planet Yortar. The subsequent gravitational distortions ravaged the planet and ended the golden age of interplanet trade and mining. Completely forsaken by the rest of the universe, the remaining colonies have endured in solitude behind their protective domes. But their survival has come at a great cost as revolts and banishments have vastly altered most societies.As the dust of social unrest is settling and the endless spacetime fluctuations are finally starting to diminish, the new leadership of each colony is looking outward again but with different agendas. Some leaders want to research new technologies to rebuild and improve living conditions for their citizens. Others will be seeking domination over the other colonies through conquest or by manipulating the exiled. Certain are hoping to reclaim their vast riches by rebuilding the abandoned gold mines and controlling trade. Some are only interested in answers, or even better, satisfy the general lust of the populace for vengeance. What and who caused the cataclysm? Are the rumors about secret experiments with a warping portal true?Whichever road is chosen, the results will determine what species will remain in power and which will succumb to revolution.MultiplayerIn this standard competitive mode all players will take on each other to achieve the most mission points. With the extreme amount of possibilities to configure a game the replayability is almost unlimited and with random setup you will never play the same game twice.Team ModeIt’s also possible to play The Warp in team mode. In this mode you will co-operate with a teammate to defeat your common foes. Team mode offers you the chance to discuss your individual strategy and draft your alien species and missions together during setup. With the base game you can play 2 vs 2. The expansion also makes it possible to play 2 vs 2 vs 2.Solo ModeThe game features a campaign based solo mode against an automa rival. You start with a limited pool of aliens to choose from. Like in the multiplayer game you combine 2 of them for your current mission. Choose an alien rival with a specific playing style and a unique way of scoring mission points. When you succeed you can recruit the alien species for your further adventures on the planet Yortar and you will unlock new rivals. Of course we are completely convinced about The Warp, but the game has been playtested by many players. Here are some other opinions about the game:Shipping will be charged through the pledge manager when the campaign is over. You don't have to add it to your pledge amount. You can find the safe estimates in the table below. Final prices will depend on the final weight and the volume we have to ship. Also big changes in the EUR/USD conversion rate can cause fluctuations. We'll do our best to maintain the prices listed below and we will provide clear communication if there would be a reason to increase them.We are quite experienced in shipping through Europe so we'll process these shipments ourselves so we can guarantee a high standard. For other regions we'll use partners that are experienced in the fulfilment of board games.You can find more information about the group pledge in update 14 on Kickstarter.

The possibilities are HUGE!Hi, My name is Alex, and this is my 3rd Kickstarter. About a year ago, because I couldn't find affordable generic nameplates for my miniatures, I started selling nameplates on Kickstarter under the Warg'Name brand.My will at first was to provide to the community affordable and easy to print by yourselves nameplates for the games who require generic tagging : Bloodbowl, Warcry, Warhammer Quest... And to help some makers adding a personal touch to their project (see Greg Kourakos' 2 kickstarters, Wukong and Pit Fighter)After a year, I felt greatly dissatisfied. I kept receiving demands for specific nameplates, and also it still took me a very long time to make all the nameplates for the games, because of the different sizes, the different designs, the different fonts... And mostly because people wanted their mini to be unique (Like I do myself!)How to solve that?The answer came from Greg Kourakos and some of my resellers.  Alex, you should stop selling nameplates, but sell templates so that people can make their own nameplates! And here we are. Well, while preparing the Kickstarter, we wondered if everyone might be familiar with nameplates. So this is our 2 cents about it.Nameplates are little plates that can be flat or curved, made of resin, that you put in front of your miniature base. they are mostly the same height or a little more than the base, and if done well, they follow the base perfectly.The size of the nameplate is mostly separated between those : a little less than 90° of the base, a little more than 90° of the base, almost 180° or a full ring.We decided to base our nameplates on around 135° arc. I will not lie to you : it's not a 2 clics nameplate generator. It's more like a 10-20 clics nameplate maker.I will basically provide you everything until the very last step so that you can make nameplates with blender. Once the software installed, you will just have to:
 choose your nameplate style
choose your greeblies
choose your text, 
choose your font, 
and export. done.
For most nameplates, you don't need to learn anything. Just follow the provided guide. For some advanced models (like carved ones) there are 4-5 more steps and really easy  tricks to follow.I wanted to make a video to show how it works, but Ben, from the Bonehead Podcast, was faster than me:

 
That's it.And if you are still asking yourself about the difference between the 3D model and the final result, watch this :Regarding your pledge, you will have access to :
A document that specifies how to use the nameplate creator

A document that specifies how to presupport your nameplates

A document that specifies how to paint your nameplates on Non Metallic Metal style

Different Templates

Different Sizes for the templates
Different greeblies


One year of updates after the KS
Regarding sizing :Some specific templates, like for bloodbowl, will be provided with limited number of sizes that fits the game.Is becoming a reseller worth it?Well, think about it. If you are in a club, you at least 5 or 6 people who needs nameplates for their teams. If you have a local miniature seller (or if you are one), maybe he'll be happy to add those to what he can sell to his customers. A physical nameplate sells today from 2€ to 5.5€ regarding the complexity/size. A bloodbowl(c) team for example is 16 minis. A game like the last warhammer quest is about 50 minis.  A dungeons and Dragons Party is 4-6 characters.  A 40K army or a AoS one includes easily 5 to 10 named characters... And the printing of a full plate is less than a euro of resin. It's really easy to get back on your investment, not even counting what you will print for yourself!There are many ways to sell :You can decide to be full custom, like an established nameplate reseller. Let the customers choose their size, their nameplate style, their greeblies, their fonts.... And give you the names they are looking for.you can prepare some styles, adapted to different games, and just give your customers the possibility to change the names. This way you can sell on different platforms, like etsy, ebay ...You can prepare nameplates like we did for bloodbowl, warcry, cursed city.... and sell them in bulk, printed or as STLsOur ONLY condition : Warg'Name's logo has to be apposed near every image of nameplate you made with our nameplate creator. This will help on one side promoting our work, and on the other side, it will be a proof of quality for your buyers. What about the competitors? Well, find me people that can sell as fast as you can around your place, be there to support... The market is increasing but still young, so the needs will all develop! Becoming a reseller is a way to participate in the community. You can also sign in with friends!All stretch Goals have been unlocked during the kickstarter. This is a recapitulative list showing you all the styles available (don't bother the colors, all is unlocked).Let's have a look at the full list:for the nameplate styles, title means it is meant to be used as a nameplate with title, oval means the design will also be made for oval nameplates.  For the greeblies, most are available in different positions to fit the styles. I show you different examples to work your imagination. You can also mix and match them to your needs.The restrictions are mostly for big sizes, or for oval nameplates.   Special : Marvel : Crisis Protocol and Infinity the Game nameplates + Star Wars Legion.Those were a real challenge, because they don't follow the standard models I use. So instead of forcing people to use the GW nameplates shapes for it, I decided to limit the choice of greeblies/models available, but adapt them exactly to the original base.Definitely, if you want to print by yourself, you need a resin printer. There are established brands, a lot bringing affordable machines : anycubic, elegoo, longer, phrozen... We tested our nameplates to be printed on 0.05mm on a Elegoo Mars pro. The sold nameplates will be printed on Phrozen sonic mini 4K on 0.035, with anycubic transparent green resin (the one we found to have the best properties).We tried to exaggerate most details on the templates so that they are visible on the final product.Don't worry about that, All will be delivered on a google drive, where you will have access to everything :) And Also the organisation will be clear so that you don't lose time searching for your nameplate's templates. Rob Baer, SpikeyBits

Intrepid colonists system-wide use Vipers in every manner of hard vacuum and hostile environment. The bipedal vehicles have proved to be rugged, durable, and easily printed and assembled, even from hobbyist weld-printers or simpler models of colonial material fabricator boxes (fabboxes).Humans being humans, though, the Viper Suit was soon pressed into combat.  The modular nature of the Viper makes it able to be fitted with weaponry from the Earth Defense Forces, the Titan Marines, or any other faction that wants to protect its oxygen and ore. Protective plating forged to stop incoming micrometeorites can also resist small arms fire. Open-source weapon files and ammunition recipes are readily found on the SystemNet.Mankind didn’t leave violence behind on Earth. The Viper Suit is proof that any tool, even one that is 18 feet tall, can be reforged into a weapon.Tell Me More.  Now.Like the opening text stated in such flowery prose, the Viper Suit is pretty simple.It's a downloadable package of .stl files so you can print a physical model of the Viper Suit mech. Stereolithography, or STL for short, is the format most printers take.At its simplest, The Viper Suit is hull, legs, and weapons, with the potential for more add-ons and other figures.  Where we go from there is a matter of stretch goals that will indicate how much more folks want. If things go well, there’s potential for redesigning some old 15mm Rebel Minis favorites, updating and refreshing the designs for both scales.GunCATs, RUMV civilian vehicles, new power armors, detailed interior cockpits, stowage sets, and much, much more. And Jetpacks. Jetpacks!!!Along the way, we’ll also have discounted digital files for 28mm and 15mm tanks, armored vehicles, and even Megatanks! Woot! Megatanks!      Will There Be Physical Models? I don’t have a printer. Yet.While we encourage every hobbyist to get their own 3D printer, we understand that finances and space requirements don’t always make that possible.We are going to sell commercial licenses, five on this Kickstarter, five others world-wide through other means, to service bureaus and entrepreneurs with printers who can take orders, print, and ship physical models to your address.Or, convince your boss at work that the office really, really needs one. Don’t ask why, boss, just order it! Which Printer Should I Get?There are two major types of printers on the market.  FDM printers, which extrude a thin string of hot plastic layer by layer on top of each other until you have a physical object, or resin printers, which flash-cure objects out of a tank of gooey resin, layer by layer.Both types are capable of great prints. Resin printers have a slight edge on detail and ease of operation, but can be messier to clean up. We recommend resin printers, despite the post-processing drudgery. Keeping a clean, well-ventilated workspace is key. Lots of rubbing or wood alcohol, rubber gloves, and paper towels helps.The Viper Suit was test-printed on an Elegoo Saturn resin 3D printer. The Saturn has proved to be a reliable workhorse, with capable resolution, great speed, and a generous build envelope.   You can get one delivered via Amazon Prime for $500 USD.https://smile.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Photocuring-Act...Now, that’s a lot of money. You can go smaller, or you can split the costs with a friend, family member, or local gaming club. I highly recommend the Saturn, though. I have no affiliation or endorsement deal. I’m just a happy customer who likes things that work.If the Saturn is out of the budget, there’s always the Elegoo Mars 2 Pro. It’s a proven printer with lots of aftermarket and consumer support. You’re limited in build envelope, but not resolution. It and other printers its size are probably ideal, if you’re just going to do 15mm Viper Suits.https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0957CK52TYou can go cheaper, and you can often find the above printers on sale. Those are the ones we can recommend, though, for personal use.Magnetization? What’s That?Some parts of the model will need to be glued together. We recommend a gel super glue. Larger models like the Viper Suit, though, lend themselves to swapping out components.There is an option for twist-lock joints at the shoulders, but we also made arrangements for magnets to be incorporated into the design.Specifically, neodyminium magnets 8 millimeters in diameter that are 3mm thick. If you have 8mm x 2mm or 8mm x 1mm, those are cool, too, but you might need to stack them or combine them with steel washers for optimum hold.You can buy a 100-pack of these magnets on Amazon at https://smile.amazon.com/DIYMAG-Refrigerator-Ma...We have also found them at our neighborhood hardware store, though they are in smaller packs. It’s good to support your local hardware store, though. Unless they’re mean, of course. I like Stretch Goals.  What Stretch Goals Are Planned?We are but simple prototyper folk, and do not have outrageous demands nor extravagant dreams.Here’s what we have planned.At $250 USD- We fund!  That Viper Suit goodness is guaranteed to be in your inbox at the end of the campaign, once the money clears. At $500 USD, If this initial goal is reached, we’ll offer our own 100mm and 50mm Scenic Bases and Base Toppers for existing bases. These round disks and accessories will be Industrial and Futuristic in nature.If you want your own non-printed bases, we can recommend a set.  For 28mm Vipers, we endorse 100mm bases from Reaper Minis. They have their own injection molding machine, and keep things in-house. https://smile.amazon.com/Reaper-Miniatures-100m...If’n you’re making 15mm Vipers, we recommend the 2-inch bases from Reaper (51mm for you metric types). https://smile.amazon.com/Round-Plastic-Miniatur...At $1000 USD- JBR will sculpt up a detailed VPR Cockpit with control displays, ejection seat, and other fiddly bits. The referenc pic is from an A-10, so some liberties will be taken. And a jetpack for the Viper Suit. Because why not? Jetpack!!!At $1500 USD- Off-Planet Colonial Stowage Set. Rolled-up survival bubble tents, bulk storage containers, tool boxes, personal storage units, ammunition cans, and even a beer cooler! Everything to make your life as a colonial militia Viper pilot a little easier. And a colonist-sized jetpack for your own figures. Jetpack!!!At $2000 USD- Gun Drones and Repair Drones.  Is that power-spanner just out of reach? Have your robotic hangar buddy bring it over to you. Or lift that missile off you that fell of its ready rack. These drones will be modified and updated to serve as well as protect.At $2500 USD- The CATs are Cybernetic Autonomous Troopers will be upgraded and redesigned for 28mm. Towering assault and support units with electronic minds of their own. They fulfill a variety of battlefield roles, from fire support to tank-busting. TomCATs, GunCATs, FireCATs, and even the anti-armor PanzerCATs! And jetpacks for the CATs. CAT Jetpack!!!At $3000 USD- The Titan Marines liked the concept of the Viper Suit, but their cold arrogance forces them to shun all things from the Inner Planets. They want their own Viper Suit. With a jetpack. Jetpack!!!At $4000 USD- The RUMV system enables you to mix and match dozens of parts to make the ideal tabletop vehicle. At this level, we can offer a Civilian Flatbed vehicle with multiple means of movement (legs, hover, wheeled, tracked, and a-grav) with numerous new accessories for that modular area in the rear(Camper, APC, Improvised Colonial Tank, Recovery Vehicle, etc.).At $5000 USD- Myrmidon Power Armors (Basic Infantry Trooper). Rebel Mike and I came up with the Myrmidon powered armour (spelled intentionally for you UK types) a few years ago, but it never made it past the prototyping and master-casting stage due to budget concerns. Direct 3D printing changes that. This design will be updated and put into circulation in both 28mm and 15mm versions. They’ll be nice and big, too, to take one those other guys from forty thousand years in the future. Of course, they’ll have jetpacks, too. Jetpacks!!!At $6000 USD- The Mama Snake, as we like to call her! Viper Suits can get to the battlefield under their own power, but the MegaTank Carrier/Recovery Version gets them there in style. Disembarking from a front or rear ramp, up to four Viper Suits can be carried on this mammoth armored vehicle. There are options for recovery cranes and weapon turrets to provide support for downed armors or recovery crews.Pictured above is one of our MegaTanks.  It will be modified to become the Mama Snake.No jetpack for the Mama Snake. Are you nuts?  She will have an a-grav option, though. ? How Does This Work?Backers will get the base Viper Suit immediately after funds are finalized via a link from WeTransfer.com or a similar file transfer site.After that, depending on how things go, stretch goals will be fulfilled and made available for download. Could be days. Could be weeks. Could be a few months for the big ones, like Mama Snake. I make sure to test-print models before I make them available, so I’m not handing over untested digital junk to you.Why Crowdfunding?Why run a crowdfunding campaign? Why not just put these on an e-store and wait for things to trickle in?There are a few things.One, crowdfunding is a great marketing tool. It not only has a built-in audience, but it’s a great gauge of market appetite.Two, these files will be available on a variety of STL Store platforms like Cults3D, CGTrader, and MyMiniFactory, once the initial campaign is over. You’ll be getting a better price and package deal with the fundraising campaign, though, so best not to wait. About Rebel Minis Digital Direct and John Bear RossRebel Minis has been serving the tabletop wargame community for decades, now. Mike Renegar started it from his home in Tennessee, and it has grown to be a worldwide presence.Rebel Minis Digital Direct is a small offshoot where Mike has let John tinker for years, hoping something would come of it.The Viper Suit is the result of that patience. Hopefully, it pays off.John Bear Ross has been a digital sculptor for over 20 years, working for Rebel, Reaper, Wizkids, Khurasan, Critical Mass, Conflict Horizon, among many many others.We have a known history of delivering above and beyond customer expectations, including our Motorpool STL Kickstarter Effort from 2020. We won’t let you down.Before You GoThanks for your time for scrolling through my screed.I hope you consider pledging at any level that fits your budget. If you can't afford it, a public mention would do a lot to help me get the word out, and it's completely free to post on social media or tell a friend.

TRPG games provide an opportunity to escape and explore. Our imagination can shape other worlds there, guided by chance and the roll of the dice.
United by the love of the game, our young team joined forces and created this mythical collection - InfiniDice. These unique designs express our imagination and passion for TPRG. These heavy, intricately carved metal dice feel substantial in your hand and represent the artistic pursuit of balance, brilliant color, and a more powerful gaming experience.
Join us to elevate your game and tell your stories with greater imagination.
 

 

 
InfiniDice is made up of 6 series of dice specially designed for all TRPG players. Each series symbolizes a legendary mythical story, yielding the power of ancient mythical gods to help you become the master of your games.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The Dark Fortress - InfiniDice Tower
Tired of those direct dice towers that quickly drop and dispense the dice in an oddly unsatisfied way? The transparent Dark Fortress is designed with a unique spiral staircase to increase the tumbling of the dice. All the while, the player's fate is being determined as the dice make their way down from the mystery medieval castle.
 

 
The sound of dice bouncing and rolling adds a special atmosphere to any RPG. The circular steps of The Dark Fortress make every roll of the dice full of surprises.
 

 
The rampart of the dark fortress continues the mystery medieval castle style with a detachable design for easy storage and organizing.
 

 
Vintage Brass Dice Case
This polished brass storage case with a magnetic latch and black memory foam complements the vintage metal design aesthetic of the dice. With it, you are fully armed and ready to battle at all times.
 

 
 InfiniDice Pouch: Leather & Velvet 


 

InfiniDice Canvas Tote Bag​
 

 

 
Besides the sets you have pledged, the basic black pocketable pouch will be provided to every backer.

   Anyone can make a game on SquareOne®: every console is a dev kit. There is no need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. Because SquareOne® is based on an Android stack, any game developer can easily publish their game on SquareOne®. The possibilities are limitless, and we are very proud that every console can be a game playground for your ideas.A developer platform will be available around March 2021 to give access to a free SDK, online documentation, a console simulator, a forum, and access to our support team.But if you want to be among the first - and be sure to have your games available on the store on day one - you should pledge for the Developer Kit Pledge. This pledge allows you to receive a SquareOne® and a Dice track several months before anyone else, to have access to the future developer platform during beta phase, and to a premium support level for 12 months to help you to develop your ideas. Don't miss this great opportunity.       E.M.B. [French]  SHUT UP & SIT DOWN [English]  LUDOVOX [English] LUDOVOX [French]

     Three years ago, a team who together admired many things - technology, video games, board games, art, shows and moments of conviviality - took up a challenge. Wizama was born, the contraction of Wizard and Ama, two different languages to signify Magic and Home.​Profiles specialized in electronics, user experience, design, software and video game development, business, coming from companies like Technicolor, Thales, Apple, Ubisoft, Tencent, Xbox, Ankama, Libellud, have joined forces to give birth to SquareOne®. Several board games authors, as well as video game companies, got involved in the adventure, and we thank each of them all for their confidence and support during the development process. ​Over the years, we have designed multiple iterations of the prototype and developed several games to test the potential of the gaming experience at conventions such as the FIJ in Cannes, the Gamescom in Cologne, etc. Player feedback has helped us design the best possible experience. We also tested several aspects of our platform at the biggest electronics conventions, and we were extremely pleased to receive major awards that validated our choices in terms of Product Design, User Experience Design, and Electronics.
        And now, we’re excited to offer this brand new experience to players all over the world. We can’t wait to see SquareOne® on your table and be a source of social sharing and happiness. It will be our best possible reward as players.​Join our community to receive exclusive preview information and stay tuned for game release announcements!    REFUND GUARANTEE ​If, for any reason, we are unable to produce the SquareOne®, we will provide a full refund to every backer. ​ RISKS & CHALLENGESEvery great project has its challenges, especially those that include the combination of software, hardware, and hundreds of pieces of plastic, paper, etc. We understand the importance of bringing a high-quality product to every home. For us, compromising quality or safety is unacceptable.Our team members' past experiences have served us well in both industry knowledge and product development. Our prototype is in its final stage, the manufacturing process is already settled. Most of Wizama's in-house games, as well as our partners' games, are in an advanced stage of development (many are already finalized).We have attended a dozen gaming conventions so that players could try the SquareOne® and some of our games. They gave us the motivation to be here today. We try our best to stay close to our community through comments, private messages and our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/wizamaplay/). We really take your feedback into account, and love interacting with our community.This is the first time that we will have a 100% delivery operation, so we have considered additional planning time after the project is funded to ensure the most efficient shipping solution. We estimate a delivery date of February 2022. This is the required time to finalize the manufacturing process, produce all necessary SquareOne® consoles, and ship them to you. It’s also the time needed for our partners to finalize all the games and experiences that will be available at the launch. We also included a safety margin, in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances. It is in our best interests to get the SquareOne® to our backers as soon as possible, and we will do our best to avoid any delay.",72.0,22,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>Greetings, all! My name is Mike Yow and I'm a professional actor, tour guide, teacher author, and of course, an independent game designer! My little publishing company, as it were, is Fire In The Head Productions and we produce the small, but mighty, Savage Kingdoms tabletop roleplaying (for the past 6.5 years, in fact). We're currently in the 3rd edition of the game, the core rulebook having been crowd-funded via Indiegogo about a year ago! The Savage Kingdoms RPG focuses on a narrative storytelling-based gaming, all set within a dark and gritty sword-and-sorcery styled setting. The Savage East, the current project in question, is the second book in the SK III game line and features the eastern and southern continents of the known world (and its many seas and isle-continents). Think the Hyborian Age of Conan meets Game of Thrones.</p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Fire In The Head Productions, the producers of Savage Kingdoms, is a very small indie company - mostly just one person - and therefore doesn't quite have access to the resources associated with larger publishing and game design firms. As such, we have used crowd-funding in the past to help raise money for printing, art design, and distribution and are hoping to successfully go that route again here with this project, The Savage East.</p>
<h3>What You Get In Return</h3>
<p>Your financial contributions to this project will help us afford layout, design, artwork, and distribution of The Savage East expansion book, all quite expensive endeavors when done right. In return, contributors will receive perks and rewards dependent upon the level of contribution given. Our goal of $1,500 is pretty low, the bare minimum to do what we need to do to make the book happen. If we fall short of that goal, we'll simply save that money for future - and smaller - Fire In The Head and/or Savage Kingdoms projects. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact Made</h3>
<p>With the resurgence of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and tabletop gaming in general, we feel that our project is important to the gaming hobby and game design industry. To wit, people want more tabletop RPG options and Savage Kingdoms delivers on a lot of those wants, offering more variety, streamlined character creation, an easy action-resolution system (just 1d20 needed!), a vast and detailed setting, a slight alternative to the usual ""high fantasy"" systems, and more. Thus, if we can raise the funds for The Savage East book, the SK III line gets further extended and even more enriched. And gamers deserve such things!</p>

<h3>Our Track Record</h3>
<p>We've quite a fortunate track record, succeeding in all six of our past fund-raising projects! However, this past go-round cut it a bit close - likely due to potential pandemic-inducing financial concerns - so we're hoping that our dedication to our projects, complimented with our excellent track record, will bring us well above our goal. In fact, the more we exceed our modest $1,500 goal, the more art we can get commissioned to better produce and even more amazing aesthetic for the book! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with all crowd-funding projects, there is some risk involved. Contributors are making a leap of faith, as it were, in hopes that the project they have monetarily assisted gets made and that they receive whatever perks where promised them. Conversely, project-makers are hoping that Mother Nature doesn't interfere and slow down - or even negate - the hard work we've put into our particular projects. It should be noted, as stated above, that Fire In The Head Productions has never defaulted on a project yet and that our contributors have, to our knowledge, received all the promised perks (and, in some cases, were even given additional perks). If, for whatever reason, we are falling behind time-wise on our promised perks, we will assuredly make posts or send emails to that point, as to make everyone involved aware of the situation. </p>

<p>Lark is a game of thrill and co-creating that will ask you and your friends to share, care, and dare together.  </p>
<p>It's a bit like truth or dare but with a life-giving, affirming, and creativity embracing edge that just might bring you and your friends closer together (while also spurring each other on towards mischievious and hilarious antics and stories)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i> ""Can't say enough wonderful things about Lark. Having played an early version hundreds of times with friends it's a game that fluctuates the players between deep meaningful conversations and ridiculously creative, fun and quircky antics. From sitting and talking to jumping and laughing, it plays well with close friends or people you barely know.  </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i> Sometimes 10 cards take 2 hours, sometimes they take 20 minutes. I've played it with 2 people in the Boundary Waters, with 10 people on a crowded wedding dance floor, and a small group in my living room, local bar, and everywhere in between. It's never the same twice, it's thoughtful, engaging, and I'm so excited to get the official version!!"" -Lloyd</i></p>

<p>We were originally going to call it “Mischief,” but we realized that the game offered more than that. We so often found ourselves grateful and touched by what fellow players had prompted and shared that we nixed that idea in favor of a broader, more benevolent - but still a bit mischievous - mix of framing and prompts.</p>

<p>Lark offers itself as an invitation to break free from the routines of our lives and make something of this very moment: to have a laugh, do something fun, or discover something about ourselves or a friend. </p>

<p>Challenge, little ones and big ones, invite us to engage in the now, to be present and grow. In a playful context, they draw us out of our ruts and into our agency. We see with new eyes how we relate to those around us, our place, ourselves, and the horizon-wide potential that is waiting at the edge of our awareness, calling us into better versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>Chance because no matter how much we strive, we'll never have control. It's a joy to climb aloft on the intolerably unknowable tide of life and embrace chance and whichever of the infinite possibilities of life she wants to offer us.</p>

<p>One way to think of Lark is as a 'build your own game' kit for engaging your friends and your creative side. Part of the difficulty in describing Lark is the ambiguity it comes with. The ambiguity, as difficult as it makes it to market, is a feature of its charm that we wouldn't dream of discarding.

<p>Players take turns prompting each other to do or share (the challenge) based on the prompts in their hands or heads and the roll of a 12-sided die (the chance). Here's a copy of the guidebook  (don't worry the final version will be copy-edited and pretty!)</p>
<p>Everyone draws cards. One player, the Dealer, prompts a fellow Player or Players with a challenge inspired by his card or his imagination and then assigns the odds of it happening using the 12-sided die. If the Players accept the proposed challenge and odds, the die is cast and the play either does or does not proceed. Either way the Player who accepted the challenge becomes the new Dealer. If multiple Players are challenged by the Dealer, let the die decide who becomes the new Dealer.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: </p>
<p><i>Mavis, Laura, Bob, and James are playing Lark. They agree to play their hand “cat up.”  James reads through his cards, finds one he likes, and says to Bob, “Bob, if I roll a 9 or 12 Peacock a little.”  Bob isn’t sure he heard correctly, asks for clarification. James says, “peacock a little.” Bob is still sure he doesn’t know what that means, but trusts he’ll sort it out by the time he needs to, so says “sure thing.” James rolls the die and it lands on 10. Bob gets the die without peacocking, even just a little. James puts his used card faceup in a discard pile. </i></p>
<p><i>Bob turns to Mavis and Laura and says, “Mavis and Laura. If I roll a prime number you two race to become upside down.” Mavis and Laura are down to clown, but want to make a scene so suggest, “we’ll do it if you and James join if it lands on 1.”  Bob and James agree. The die is cast and it lands on 5. Mavis and Laura race to become upside down. To determine who gets the die Bob says, “Mavis if it’s odd you get it, Laura evens.”  He rolls a 3 and gives the die to Mavis.</i></p>
<p><i>Mavis, deciding she likes her idea more than those on her cards, says, “James if I roll an even you reenact a scene from your favorite movie without speaking.” James says, “Nah, odds are too high.” Mavis says, “alright, 3-5.” James says, “I’m game.” Before Mavis can cast the die, Laura plays the “Everyone Join In”  Wild Card and looks around for consent. Everyone agrees so Mavis casts the die and the game goes on. </i></p>
<p>As the game goes on and you and your fellow players take the tenets to heart you will begin creating the game in your own style while inventing your own prompts. This improves the game exceedingly.</p>

<p>Lark was born out of a desire to engage in what Herman Hesse called ""the inexhaustible fun of daily life."" We wanted a playful way to engage each other at the edge of our comfort zones - a game that offered the opportunity to be playful and vulnerable, whichever best suited the group’s mood and location. The first game we ever played was at a distillery in Minneapolis - at least one of the prompts from that night is featured in the game we know today. We’ve since taken the idea and tried it everywhere we could.</p>
<p>We’ve transformed the game from an idea into a ready-to-roll adventure. It looks as good on your shelf as it does at a picnic or crushed in the brain of your backpack.</p>

<p>So, Lark is at least two things. It is a silly game designed to empower you and your friends to make some fun, some memories, maybe some mischief. It is also an invitation to explore in vulnerability and sincerity and to find yourself affirmed and maybe even a bit more confident and curious while engaging with your friends in a new way or shedding a new light on an old friendship.</p>
<p>Whether you find yourself playing in your living room, kitchen, via FaceTime , on a road trip, in the high alpine snow fields of the Rockies, a sauna, sailboat, ski yurt, Saturday afternoon hike, brewery, favorite bar, back row of a concert, front row of a concert, church, canoe trip, baptism, beach day, backyard bonfire, first date, mid-life crises, the hospital room where you just met your firstborn, or lastborn, or anywhere else you can imagine, Lark will keep good company and get better as you make it your own.</p>

</div></div>","Lark is a game of thrill and co-creating that will ask you and your friends to share, care, and dare together.  
It's a bit like truth or dare but with a life-giving, affirming, and creativity embracing edge that just might bring you and your friends closer together (while also spurring each other on towards mischievious and hilarious antics and stories)
 ""Can't say enough wonderful things about Lark. Having played an early version hundreds of times with friends it's a game that fluctuates the players between deep meaningful conversations and ridiculously creative, fun and quircky antics. From sitting and talking to jumping and laughing, it plays well with close friends or people you barely know.  
 Sometimes 10 cards take 2 hours, sometimes they take 20 minutes. I've played it with 2 people in the Boundary Waters, with 10 people on a crowded wedding dance floor, and a small group in my living room, local bar, and everywhere in between. It's never the same twice, it's thoughtful, engaging, and I'm so excited to get the official version!!"" -Lloyd

We were originally going to call it “Mischief,” but we realized that the game offered more than that. We so often found ourselves grateful and touched by what fellow players had prompted and shared that we nixed that idea in favor of a broader, more benevolent - but still a bit mischievous - mix of framing and prompts.

Lark offers itself as an invitation to break free from the routines of our lives and make something of this very moment: to have a laugh, do something fun, or discover something about ourselves or a friend. 
You can and should play anywhere and it gets better the more you make it your own.


 

 

Challenge, little ones and big ones, invite us to engage in the now, to be present and grow. In a playful context, they draw us out of our ruts and into our agency. We see with new eyes how we relate to those around us, our place, ourselves, and the horizon-wide potential that is waiting at the edge of our awareness, calling us into better versions of ourselves.
Chance because no matter how much we strive, we'll never have control. It's a joy to climb aloft on the intolerably unknowable tide of life and embrace chance and whichever of the infinite possibilities of life she wants to offer us.
And yet, Lark is just a game. Like life itself do not take it too seriously. Have fun, make mischief, affirm someone.
 

One way to think of Lark is as a 'build your own game' kit for engaging your friends and your creative side. Part of the difficulty in describing Lark is the ambiguity it comes with. The ambiguity, as difficult as it makes it to market, is a feature of its charm that we wouldn't dream of discarding. The ambiguity leaves room for you and your friends to make it in your own style, to transform and recreate it in ways that suit you and bring the game to life. 
We made up the guidelines, prompts, tenets, and wild cards, you do with them and the die what you want. Use all of the components or choose just a few.

<h2>Behind the Scenes...</h2>
</div></div><p>Technology has finally caught up to customer desires! We've created a new and innovative way to give our customers the widest selection of licensed products; but this campaign is also about helping our small business move from mass production in China to local, small batch manufacturing here in the United States.</p><p>Over the years, our teams have been decorated in the U.S., Haiti, Hong Kong, and China. Currently, our teams are made in large lots in China, shipped to the U.S., and then reordered when stock runs low. This is a four-month process with high minimum order quantities for each team and style. We currently make only one home and one away style per team.</p><p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626195612/tjltbbcgtxtw7ylwriae.jpg"" src=""""/><i>Uni-Forms vs. older production teams. Note the detailed bolts on the legs and shoulders. </i></p><p>The NFL has announced that teams will have the freedom to wear a variety of uniform styles. College football has been trending in the same direction, led by schools like the Oregon Ducks and the Oklahoma State Cowboys. The NBA and MLB are doing fun and interesting things with uniforms, and the NCAA is allowing student athletes to cut their own licensing deals.</p><p>Our production process worked fairly well in the past when uniform styles rarely changed. Many in our hobby don't realize that our stock of older production figures represents years of unsold inventory.</p><p>As today’s sports leagues increasingly embrace multiple uniforms per team, we want to be able to provide the uniform choices that fans want, without the long lead times and high minimum orders our current production process demands.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p><strong>Outdated inventory</strong>: Often times our inventory of newer production figures no longer matches the current on-field uniforms. When a team changes their uniform after we've ordered, or wears multiple uniforms, you can guess the rest -- excess stock, stock outages, and unhappy customers.</p><p><b>Guesswork</b>: Which teams are going to be good this year? Free agent signings? Power rankings? Winning teams sell. We have to guess/predict each team's level of success months before the season starts to make sure we have the right products available.</p><p>For example, we ordered Patriots when Tom Brady was quarterback. When Brady signed with the Buccaneers, we sold out of the Bucs and have plenty of Patriots in stock. The Bucs go on to win the Super Bowl, and we can't make them in time. In fact, we've been sold out of the World Champs two years in a row. The Bucs in 2020 and the Chiefs in 2019. Ouch!</p><p><strong>Details, details</strong>: Our Coaches want to put the best-looking team possible on the field, especially in tournaments and league play.  The uniforms on our figures produced in China are well-done, but missing the detail coaches and collectors want.</p><p>When setting the designs for manufacturing, we have to reduce the detail to meet the capabilities of the factory, so many key elements of the uniform such as team names, helmet detail, jersey and pant striping, socks, logos, and patches are missing or less detailed.</p><p>The result? Our customers see new and detailed uniforms on TV or in the stadium and are left wanting what we don't have and can't provide.</p><p><strong>Bottom line</strong>:  Our customers want realism and choices, uniforms are getting more complex, and our traditional production process just won't cut it. This situation is threatening our hobby, what can we do?</p><h2>Uni-Forms: Born of Blood</h2><p>During the Christmas rush, it's all hands on deck at the busiest time of the year.

<p>MEGAcquire GOLD is my next step in continuing the quest to expand Sid Sackson's magnificent ideas and get them onto as many gaming tables as possible. You can secure a new challenge based on an old, favorite, and familiar game for the price of $65 plus shipping to your location after production is complete. Not a cheap cardboard rendition of an icon, on which the pieces slide across the board, but a tough durable plastic edition with an expanded board and hexagon shaped tiles. Double the possibilities, double the fun, and an outcome undecided until the end.</p>
<p>We have made a few minor changes from the production run of MEGAcquire and this next production run of MEGAcquire GOLD. The money has been changed to prepaid debit cards and the denominations have been raised to 1, 5, 10, &amp; 50 million. Who will become the first billionaire in MEGAcquire GOLD? The rule booklet has a new cover and included in the booklet is a sample game narration to help first time players and a Stock Price Extension Chart that is used to help calculate payouts when companies are bought out and at the end of the game. We have also enlarged the tile holders and redesigned the box insert for better storage. The company markers are being made in three different shapes to better designate the difference in their starting price value and to give them a 3D effect. The playing tiles will be gold. So as the board fills up during game play, it turns to gold! Most importantly, we have demanded a better process for printing the designations on the tiles. </p>

<p>About MEGAcquire GOLD</p>
<p>MEGAcquire GOLD is an exciting journey of strategy and luck, for three to six players, through the corporate world of building empires and wealth. Live in the world of fun and fortune as you maneuver to outwit your opponents. Build and merge companies while shrewdly buying, trading, and selling stocks to become the wealthiest player.</p>
<p>Each player builds companies by adding tiles as they increase wealth by purchasing stocks in these companies. Cash flow is obtained by selling majority and minority shares through mergers. It is not always prudent to have the most stock in the biggest company, if you can build and sell enough smaller companies to generate a large income. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of the corporate world, but you will always need the “luck of the draw.""</p>

</div><p>MEGAcquire GOLD will appeal to players of any age, who like the feeling of power that is acquired through achievement. It is recommended for ages 13 and up, but cannot be limited in age because of the early possession of business savvy that can be found in younger players.

MEGAcquire proved to be a fantastic game and in some corners of the world, it is difficult to get avid players of MEGAcquire to play the game of ACQUIRE again.Below is a video that explains how to play MEGAcquire. Here are also two links to videos on YouTube that show actual game play of MEGAcquire complete with instructional and strategy tips. The game was filmed in two halves. Here is the first half and here is the second half of the game. 
Here is a link to the MEGAcquire GOLD Game Components Page on the Acquisition Games Website and here is a link to the MEGAcquire GOLD Rules Booklet Page.
MEGAcquire GOLD is my next step in continuing the quest to expand Sid Sackson's magnificent ideas and get them onto as many gaming tables as possible. You can secure a new challenge based on an old, favorite, and familiar game for the price of $65 plus shipping to your location after production is complete. Not a cheap cardboard rendition of an icon, on which the pieces slide across the board, but a tough durable plastic edition with an expanded board and hexagon shaped tiles. Double the possibilities, double the fun, and an outcome undecided until the end.
We have made a few minor changes from the production run of MEGAcquire and this next production run of MEGAcquire GOLD. The money has been changed to prepaid debit cards and the denominations have been raised to 1, 5, 10, & 50 million. Who will become the first billionaire in MEGAcquire GOLD? The rule booklet has a new cover and included in the booklet is a sample game narration to help first time players and a Stock Price Extension Chart that is used to help calculate payouts when companies are bought out and at the end of the game. We have also enlarged the tile holders and redesigned the box insert for better storage. The company markers are being made in three different shapes to better designate the difference in their starting price value and to give them a 3D effect. The playing tiles will be gold. So as the board fills up during game play, it turns to gold! Most importantly, we have demanded a better process for printing the designations on the tiles.

About MEGAcquire GOLD
MEGAcquire GOLD is an exciting journey of strategy and luck, for three to six players, through the corporate world of building empires and wealth. Live in the world of fun and fortune as you maneuver to outwit your opponents. Build and merge companies while shrewdly buying, trading, and selling stocks to become the wealthiest player.
Each player builds companies by adding tiles as they increase wealth by purchasing stocks in these companies. Cash flow is obtained by selling majority and minority shares through mergers. It is not always prudent to have the most stock in the biggest company, if you can build and sell enough smaller companies to generate a large income. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of the corporate world, but you will always need the “luck of the draw.""

MEGAcquire GOLD will appeal to players of any age, who like the feeling of power that is acquired through achievement. It is recommended for ages 13 and up, but cannot be limited in age because of the early possession of business savvy that can be found in younger players.

<p>Evolved Tabletop Games' vision is to create cost-effective 3D modular terrain which is immersive and compatible with a variety of tabletop games.</p>
<p>Evolved Tabletop Games started when we were dissatisfied of our missions being limited by one or two playmats and the limited layouts they provided. We were also struggling to be immersed in the narrative when we were using flat, 2D designs to portray hills &amp; valleys.</p>
<p>Our founder is a passionate tabletop gamer who plays Warhammer 40k and Dungeons &amp; Dragons and wanted to create immersive and thematic environment which could be incorporated into the games he played. Thus, our first project was born.</p>
<p>This project focuses on 3D printable, highly detailed modular battlefields, which opens the possibility of any thematic narrative. The modular battlefield can even be used in your display cabinets to complement your miniatures. The best part is you can print as much or as little as you need!</p>
<p>These tiles can be used as is, or be painted to suit the world's that your games are set, or lands that your miniatures inhabit.</p>
<p>After this campaign is concluded we hope to make other themes such as cities, deserts and temples, which will be able to combine with this project's terrain and blend together.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary



Evolved Tabletop Games' vision is to create cost-effective 3D modular terrain which is immersive and compatible with a variety of tabletop games.
Evolved Tabletop Games started when we were dissatisfied of our missions being limited by one or two playmats and the limited layouts they provided. We were also struggling to be immersed in the narrative when we were using flat, 2D designs to portray hills & valleys.
Our founder is a passionate tabletop gamer who plays Warhammer 40k and Dungeons & Dragons and wanted to create immersive and thematic environment which could be incorporated into the games he played. Thus, our first project was born.
This project focuses on 3D printable, highly detailed modular battlefields, which opens the possibility of any thematic narrative. The modular battlefield can even be used in your display cabinets to complement your miniatures. The best part is you can print as much or as little as you need!
These tiles can be used as is, or be painted to suit the world's that your games are set, or lands that your miniatures inhabit.
After this campaign is concluded we hope to make other themes such as cities, deserts and temples, which will be able to combine with this project's terrain and blend together.

<h3>For the True Crime/Horror Lover</h3>
<p>This game is a culmination of the love that I have for card games, role playing games, true crime and horror. My interest in killers, of all kinds, started at a young age. I grew up just outside Philadelphia and my dad had so many stories to tell. His dealings with Angelo Bruno (head of the Philly Mob), meeting Charles Manson, to leading us to believe that my childhood home was owned by Jeffrey Dahmer's uncle. There has always been one question that I have always wanted to understand: What is the one thing that causes someone to cross the line and become a killer? Many of us fit the common classification, but never cross the line...why? So as I have dug in and really researched these horrific stories I found the passion to create this game.</p>
<p>It is not only a card game, but a compendium of killers that you may/may not know. This has always driven my own curiosity to learn and discover more. As we continue to create expansions and grow the list of killers included it becomes a collectible trading card game.</p>

<h3>The Cold Hard Facts</h3>
<p>Killers - the card game is a collectible card game currently featuring 25 unique killer cards, 25 victim cards, and 4 unique scenario cards for the base game. The Organized Crime and World of Serial Killers Expansions adds an additional 140 unique killers, 40 weapons, 20 victim and 20 scenario cards to the game.</p>
<p>The base game is for 2-4+ players, but will increase with expansions.</p>
<p>To win the game be the player that reaches 10 kills first or has the last killer standing.</p>
<p>We are looking to hit our funding goal of $5000 to fulfill the quality manufacturing, production of new cards, and to take care of our legal needs. This will also enable us the ability to have some games in stock so we can continue sharing the fun at some of the local expos that we will be attending (HAH, Louisville - Horrorhound, Cincinnati - Dark History Con, Chicago)</p>
<p>In addition to the perks that we are already offering we will have some amazing stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7,500 - Upgraded Thick Tokens (from shards to chit board)</li>
<li>$10,000 - Custom Evidence Die</li>
<li>$12,000 - Custom Long Box to hold all cards</li>
</ul>

<p>Estimated shipping costs for Base Game, Add-ons, and Stretch Goals (up to 10lb package)</p>

<li>United States - $10 - 18 (most states) $20 - 25 (Hawaii &amp; Alaska)</li>

Killers - the card game is a collectible card game currently featuring 25 unique killer cards, 25 victim cards, and 4 unique scenario cards for the base game. The Organized Crime and World of Serial Killers Expansions adds an additional 140 unique killers, 40 weapons, 20 victim and 20 scenario cards to the game.
The base game is for 2-4+ players, but will increase with expansions.
To win the game be the player that reaches 10 kills first or has the last killer standing.
We are looking to hit our funding goal of $5000 to fulfill the quality manufacturing, production of new cards, and to take care of our legal needs. This will also enable us the ability to have some games in stock so we can continue sharing the fun at some of the local expos that we will be attending (HAH, Louisville - Horrorhound, Cincinnati - Dark History Con, Chicago)
In addition to the perks that we are already offering we will have some amazing stretch goals:

$7,500 - Upgraded Thick Tokens (from shards to chit board)
$10,000 - Custom Evidence Die
$12,000 - Custom Long Box to hold all cards


Estimated shipping costs for Base Game, Add-ons, and Stretch Goals (up to 10lb package)

United States - $10 - 18 (most states) $20 - 25 (Hawaii & Alaska)
Rest of the World - $29 - 40 (estimated)
NOTE these are rough estimated and accurate costs will be calculated after the campaign judging by your actual address.
NOTE we DO NOT cover customs or taxes




         
             

 

The Verdict
Since we have the option of a ""Flexible"" campaign we will be able to fulfill any orders that come in. So if you are a backer and are generous enough to support our amazing campaign, we will have the funds to fulfill any orders that are placed and the included perks. 
                     
                     

 
Slash Your Way to the Top
                                                     


Shuffle & Deal 5 Killer cards to each player or choose what 5 killers you want to play with (only one of each unique killer can be used each game)
Shuffle Victim & Scenario Cards and place in the middle of the play area
Decide who will be rolling for the Police (or share the responsibility)
Roll to see who goes first
That player will draw a Victim Card
Victim Card: place it in middle of the play area (Killers that kill within their specialty get a bonus point for each roll)
Scenario Card: follow directions on card


Choose which killer will attempt an abduction and if it will be a charisma or brutality abduction. Roll Dice and add your charisma or brutality points. 
Victim will either be abducted or get away, you may leave evidence
If evidence is left, complete an evidence roll


If Victim is abducted attempt a kill. Roll dice and add brutality points.
Victim with either be killed or get away, you may leave evidence
If evidence is left, complete an evidence roll
If Victim is killed, place that Victim under that killer


Next person takes their turn
When all the turns are completed the Police have the chance to search for evidence or apprehend a killer who has 3 pieces of evidence against them found.
Searching for evidence: Dice roll minus killers intelligence points determines if evidence is found
Apprehending a killer: 3 evidence tokens must be found - Dice roll minus Elusive points determine if killer is apprehended. If killer is apprehended you lose all kills that killer has accrued. 


First player to 10 kills or the player who has the last killer standing wins.


Specialty - Charisma/Brutality/Intelligence/Elusive

Well, here below a few reasons that may help you decide why it's worth supporting our little incredibly-awesome independent creation!</i></p><ol>
<li>
<strong>It's an extremely fast game.</strong> A match usually lasts about 15 minutes in Basic Mode (about 30 minutes with the Advanced Rules… and up to 60 minutes in Wastelands Mode), but <b>the real edge of the game is its pace</b>: run over your opponent withouth leaving him/her time to breathe. R:TA has been designed with the aim to simulate the passing of days and let you feel the pressure of surviving an hostile environment.</li>
<li>
<strong> It's unlike anything you've ever tried before.</strong> And why? Because there are no turns. A completely original game system that synthesize the best RPGs and boardgames elements into <i>one-of-a-kind</i> survival experience in which <b>players substantially play simultaneously</b>.</li>
<li>
<strong> It is easy to learn.</strong> But, at the same time, it is strategic:  and this is because the game system is intuitive and flexible... it's a game in which every choice you make is affected by need and by the choices of the other players. All the efforts of our creative team have been aimed at improving every single detail (from wording to cards layouts) in order to make the gaming experience the more immediate and enjoyable is possible. But, the more you dig into it, the more you will discover it's a game which offers endless possibilities... as we always say: <i>easy to learn, hard to master!</i> </li>
<li>
<strong>It is IMMERSIVE.</strong> It's not just about sitting down and casting spells and monsters against your opponents, like you do in almost any other card game. <i>In R:TA you can explore and conquer the world around you. You can make alliances with other survivors and recruit them. You can search for treasures or forge weapons with which to crush your enemies. It is completely immersive, since the protagonist is YOU within this rotten and decaying universe.</i> And it's not a game in which the only goal is winning... <b>the goal, in R:TA, is to stay alive in a hostile world</b>. One of the big limitations of standard role-playing games is that you have to follow a story... it's like walking on a fixed track. In R:TA it's you who create the story. Your story and the history of your world, according to the choices you make, game after game. And by progressing through your own story you earn experience and status, <i>leveling-up</i> and learning new skills which will help you shape your doom.</li>
<li>
<strong>It's a lot of fun.</strong> There is no way we can really tell you, and anyway you would not believe it... you just have to give it a try. You can play R:TA in classic two players mode, one versus one... or with all your friends, up to 8 players in various different <i>modes</i>. Even in SOLO gameplay, thanks to the <i>Wastelands Kit </i>(check the ADD-ONS section). But the feature we really want to point out is its <b>endless</b><strong> </strong><i><strong>replayability</strong>.</i> What the creators (<i>Daniele Visentin</i> and <i>Max Pietricola</i>) wanted to achieve was a game where players would never play twice the same match... and nobody expected it would have worked out so amazingly well!</li>
<li>
<strong>It's a true work of Art!</strong> We have worked hard with the best illustrators and designers out there and we put great efforts in creating suggestive lore and background for the game. The result is a really amazing experience on both the gaming and artistic side. You can check on our Instagram page almost all the cards and artworks of which R:TA is composed by following this <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rust_the_afterworld/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LINK</a></strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>It's an high quality and 100% eco-friendly product.</strong> This is a really important point for us... especially considering the subject matter of the game itself! Our playing cards are printed on a special 330 gr/sqm triplex paper of casino quality, assuring zero transparency, easy to shuffle and resistant to worn-out. <i>They are soooo cool</i>, not even comparable to the average gaming cards. BUT the high quality of the product does not prevent us from realizing a <i>100% eco-friendly game</i>, with the bare minimum quantity of plastic materials and only in re-usable forms. Also, we work with factories entirely powered by photovoltaics with the most modern and sophisticated technologies of printing and packaging and we are proud to say that<i> our game is 100% Made in Italy!</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It's a game we've created for you.</strong> The biggest limitation of many other card games is that they are ""collectible"" card games. R:TA is not, because there is no rarity of cards at all. And we will continue to expand it with new expansion sets (the first one called <i>THE KINGDOM</i> coming really soon) and packages for advanced players, but they will never be randomly combined. The player will always know what he/she is buying. We want people to play R:TA and have fun, we want tournaments to be run. And we are also giving life to an official championship, without all those elements that make other games so frustrating. We DO NOT want people to spend tons of  money just to build a deck that will be useless after a few months. Because we are not one of those greedy multinational companies: <strong>we are players creating a game for players.</strong>

<p>The major risk for a young independent company like ours is the unforeseen. Said so, the present one is our third crowdfunding campaign (after the successful ones of April 2019 and May 2021 on Kickstarter) and we are not newbies anymore... :)</p>
<p>The game is already complete in all its parts. The main core of R:TA has been enjoyed by tons of backers from all over the world in the last two years, and is ready to be reprinted. Also, as you may already know, this is actually a “<i>side campaign</i>” (or otherwise a complementary one), meaning that the actual production process is already in an advanced stage after our previous crowdfunding campaign (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theafterworldcompany/rust-the-afterworld-2nd-print-run-with-new-contents?ref=user_menu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">check here</a>) and all the perks of the present IGG will converge in tail of that same printing batch. In other words: <i>risks are lowered almost to zero since the main elements of the game are already in actual production phase</i>. And all the brand new IGG exclusive will be finalized soon as well!</p>
<p>The artists and collaborators we have involved in this project are talented professionals. We are all working really hard to bring you the best possible gaming experience within the date of delivery. And also the partners we have chosen to be entrusted with the printing and delivery process are international companies, so we are confident this amazing adventure will be accomplished without any issue at all.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. But be sure we are committed to create the best possible experience for the players and every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product.</p>

And now it's back in this new amazing EXTENDED EDITION just for you, for a limited time only.  Also with FREE SHIPPING on almost all worldwide destinations (check shipping paragraph below).PLEASE NOTE - this game edition is INDIEGOGO EXCLUSIVE. There won't be retail release and it is intended only for IGG backers. Furthermore there will be NO LATE PLEDGES nor Pledge Upgrades available (except for Shipping Upgrades) after the present campaign is ended. So: don't miss this chance, it's now or never! R:TA belongs to a completely new kind of game, we call it RolePlaying Card Game (or RPCG). It's an immersive experience with RPG's elements, supercool artworks by  world-famous artists (including John Avon, Richard Kane Ferguson, Drew Tucker and Paolo Parente), innovative mechanics and a sophisticated game system about survival. And it's unbelievably fun to play!R:TA is set in a near future, a prophetic future. A future in which the world has been devastated by a terrible Total War. And from the ashes of war a dreadful disease spread out, a plague which affects both men and machines: it is called RUST.In this rotten, shattered AfterWorld, humanity has been decimated... and the  survivors have gathered into 4 tribes, to the four corners of the Earth, fighting each others for survival. Among  the survivors, there are some chosen ones, a few special individuals  who seem to be immune to the plague and who soon become heroes for their  peoples.They are called: the Masters. And you, as a player, will be one of them!The below ADD-ONS are additional and totally optional contents, but they are meant to enrich the gaming experience. Furthermore all the PROMO CARDS included in these bundles will be printed in Limited Edition, and represent a unique opportunity to boost your R:TA collection.Among the available ADD-ONS there are some new acquaintances, as the never-before-seen INDIEGOGO exclusive Master Bundle, with many useful contents like the new Standees which makes every master's life much easier.And below you will find also some classics like the most-beloved Wastelands Kit, which is mainly a special set of cards that allow you to enjoy a new game variant... precisely called Wastelands Mode. As a matter of fact the Wastelands Kit substantially enlarges the playground and adds tons of new adventures to the basic R:TA set, pointing out the immense potential of the game also on a boardgaming perspective and offering the players a totally new and expanded gaming experience. Furthermore the kit also adds another long-awaited feature: gameplay in SOLO MODE! You can check the WIP Quickstart Guide of the Wastelands Kit HERE.Just add any of the ADD-ONS (or all of them) to your perk before check out! A very special video in which Italian reviewer JeruS gives you an overview of the new Wastelands Kit. Check it out to discover more...A Stretch Goal is an additional goal set for a fundraising campaign, in case the initial funding target is overcome... and we have some  pretty amazing Stretch Goals here to be unlocked, each one with terrific additional perks!As you can see below our Stretch Goals consist mostly in brand new limited edition Premium Cards but we included also some very special surprises too, like the first official set of R:TA MASTER MINIATURES!!! If unlocked, every supporter of this campaign that will pledge for the Extended Edition or superior perk tier (and exceptionally also including veteran backers of our previous campaign who already pledged for equivalent game sets) will have the Standees of his/her Master Bundle replaced by four new and original resin minis. It's a unique and never-before-seen upgrade for the game, not to be missed...Once again: the below items are INDIEGOGO EXCLUSIVE and not meant to be found anywhere else after the end of this campaign. When unlocked they are a special gift for ALL THE BACKERS that will support us pledging for most of the perk tiers (check the Perk buttons on top of this page). Don’t  let them slip out and help us spread the news: the more we are, the more we unlock!All the unlocked Stretch Goals will be automatically added to your perks, if eligible, at no further expense. Check them all here below... and get ready for the AfterWorld!Follow our social media pages and unlock additional goals just for being part of our Tribe. To partecipate you only need to follow our Instagram and Facebook pages linked below and contribute for at least a Perk tier before the end of this campaign. Share the news with your friends! 
If we reach 4000 followers on Instagram: a foldable paper mini-playmat for ALL THE BACKERS, really handy especially for R:TA beginners. 
If we reach 1000 likes on our Facebook page we will randomly pick 10 among our backers and they will get a Limited Edition poster (A3 format) by John Avon! 
Ok, so… why should you choose R:TA in the huge sea of nowadays tabletop games?! Well, here below a few reasons that may help you decide why it's worth supporting our little incredibly-awesome independent creation!

It's an extremely fast game. A match usually lasts about 15 minutes in Basic Mode (about 30 minutes with the Advanced Rules… and up to 60 minutes in Wastelands Mode), but the real edge of the game is its pace: run over your opponent withouth leaving him/her time to breathe. R:TA has been designed with the aim to simulate the passing of days and let you feel the pressure of surviving an hostile environment.

 It's unlike anything you've ever tried before. And why? Because there are no turns. A completely original game system that synthesize the best RPGs and boardgames elements into one-of-a-kind survival experience in which players substantially play simultaneously.

 It is easy to learn. But, at the same time, it is strategic:  and this is because the game system is intuitive and flexible... it's a game in which every choice you make is affected by need and by the choices of the other players. All the efforts of our creative team have been aimed at improving every single detail (from wording to cards layouts) in order to make the gaming experience the more immediate and enjoyable is possible. But, the more you dig into it, the more you will discover it's a game which offers endless possibilities... as we always say: easy to learn, hard to master! 

It is IMMERSIVE. It's not just about sitting down and casting spells and monsters against your opponents, like you do in almost any other card game. In R:TA you can explore and conquer the world around you. You can make alliances with other survivors and recruit them. You can search for treasures or forge weapons with which to crush your enemies. It is completely immersive, since the protagonist is YOU within this rotten and decaying universe. And it's not a game in which the only goal is winning... the goal, in R:TA, is to stay alive in a hostile world. One of the big limitations of standard role-playing games is that you have to follow a story... it's like walking on a fixed track. In R:TA it's you who create the story. Your story and the history of your world, according to the choices you make, game after game. And by progressing through your own story you earn experience and status, leveling-up and learning new skills which will help you shape your doom.

It's a lot of fun. There is no way we can really tell you, and anyway you would not believe it... you just have to give it a try. You can play R:TA in classic two players mode, one versus one... or with all your friends, up to 8 players in various different modes. Even in SOLO gameplay, thanks to the Wastelands Kit (check the ADD-ONS section). But the feature we really want to point out is its endless replayability. What the creators (Daniele Visentin and Max Pietricola) wanted to achieve was a game where players would never play twice the same match... and nobody expected it would have worked out so amazingly well!

It's a true work of Art! We have worked hard with the best illustrators and designers out there and we put great efforts in creating suggestive lore and background for the game. The result is a really amazing experience on both the gaming and artistic side. You can check on our Instagram page almost all the cards and artworks of which R:TA is composed by following this LINK.

It's an high quality and 100% eco-friendly product. This is a really important point for us... especially considering the subject matter of the game itself! Our playing cards are printed on a special 330 gr/sqm triplex paper of casino quality, assuring zero transparency, easy to shuffle and resistant to worn-out. They are soooo cool, not even comparable to the average gaming cards. BUT the high quality of the product does not prevent us from realizing a 100% eco-friendly game, with the bare minimum quantity of plastic materials and only in re-usable forms. Also, we work with factories entirely powered by photovoltaics with the most modern and sophisticated technologies of printing and packaging and we are proud to say that our game is 100% Made in Italy!


It's a game we've created for you. The biggest limitation of many other card games is that they are ""collectible"" card games. R:TA is not, because there is no rarity of cards at all. And we will continue to expand it with new expansion sets (the first one called THE KINGDOM coming really soon) and packages for advanced players, but they will never be randomly combined. The player will always know what he/she is buying. We want people to play R:TA and have fun, we want tournaments to be run. And we are also giving life to an official championship, without all those elements that make other games so frustrating. We DO NOT want people to spend tons of  money just to build a deck that will be useless after a few months. Because we are not one of those greedy multinational companies: we are players creating a game for players.

“Year 2030. After the Total War a terrible plague came out. They called it RUST.”In R:TA you are a Master, a very special individual who is at the head of one of the four tribes of Survivors that populate what remains of the Earth. Both you and your opponent(s) will start the game with a Stockpile of 20 resources, which is all you have to survive in the AfterWorld. Purpose of the game is to gain undisputed supremacy or reduce your opponent’s Stockpile to zero: the last of you who remains on the playground with still available resources is the winner of the match!The above sounds cool? Go on: you can find the FREE downloadable rulesheets (for both BEGINNERS and ADVANCED players) on our official website. Click the banner here below!In addition you can also check the How To Play video by Claudio Paola, who gives a really cool overview of the game with an entire gameplay session (check the Reviews chapter below). And don't forget to visit our INSTAGRAM and FACEBOOK  pages for having a look at tons of pictures, spoilers, decklists and much more...There is a big community out there that is already having fun with R:TA and is waiting for you to come join the Tribe! Take a look at what reviewers say about the game...    As you already know for this campaign we offer FREE STANDARD SHIPPING to almost all destinations worldwide. To the remaining ones - meaning those countries which are most distant from our shipping facilities or hardly reachable due to emergency situations - will be applied just a very minimum contribution (max. 5 euros) before finalizing the pledge, in order to support our endeavours.All of your rewards will be shipped via Standard International method (equivalent to First-Class Mail USPS) which has proved a really good and reliable service so far, according to our previous experiences. However this shipping mode doesn't provide any kind of tracking and it is fully at backer's risk, in case of loss or damages.If you want to be completely carefree you can always upgrade to a faster and 100% secure solution via TRACKED CARRIER. But you don't have to worry about this right now: we will collect the Shipping Upgrades after the campaign ends, using PayPal. We'll send all the backers a survey (some 3/5 months from now) asking if you are good with the Free Standard Shipping or if you want to upgrade to the Tracked one. So, you have plenty of time to decide!In the meantime, you can have a look at the chart here below to get an idea of how much tracked shipping to your location should cost. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated after the campaign is ended. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one-size-fits-all, and also because we may obtain a better quote with a considerable cost reduction from our fulfillment service once we have actual numbers to show.We are based in Italy but we partnered with international fulfillment/shipping services, so this project is EU/UK-FRIENDLY, US-FRIENDLY, CANADA-FRIENDLY and AUSTRALIA-FRIENDLY... meaning that all the backers from these locations won't have any import fee when getting the reward. In addition, we will definitely assist all our supporters from anywhere else in  the world, providing the best possible option in order to have the rewards delivered without any charge or issue. For any further question you can  contact us directly at: info@rusttheafterworld.comWe please ask all the backers living in remote places (i.e. islands,  war-zones, quarantined areas etc.) to get in touch prior to make any pledge so we can  guide you and offer a customized solution.The game will be printed only in ENGLISH language. However the rulesheet is already availabe also in ITALIAN on our official site www.rusttheafterworld.com.Want it translated also in other languages? Let us know, and if we reach at least 100 pledges from your country we will more than glad to work on it!Are you an event organizer or do you run a store and want to offer your playing community official R:TA sanctioned tournaments as part of our upcoming international Championship?

<p>Battle fearsome beasts. Parlay with pirates. Solve mysteries. Push back the apocalypse. </p>
<p>The Deck of Many Quests is a tool for TTRPG Game Masters and Adventurers alike. Think Cards Against Humanity meets Dungeons &amp; Dragons, minus the bathroom humor. We've created this deck to provide you nearly limitless inspiration for quickly and easily building your own adventures. Inside this box are over 200,000 unique quests.</p>

<p>The Deck of Many Quests is designed to be system-agnostic.

</div></div>","Battle fearsome beasts. Parlay with pirates. Solve mysteries. Push back the apocalypse. 
The Deck of Many Quests is a tool for TTRPG Game Masters and Adventurers alike. Think Cards Against Humanity meets Dungeons & Dragons, minus the bathroom humor. We've created this deck to provide you nearly limitless inspiration for quickly and easily building your own adventures. Inside this box are over 200,000 unique quests.

The Deck of Many Quests is designed to be system-agnostic. It doesn't matter if you're playing Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Dungeon World, or any other fantasy tabletop roleplaying game—we're here to inspire you. There are no additional systems or rules to learn, so you can start creating your own adventures in no time.
So how does it work? Read on to find out!

Quest Cards are the heart of The Deck of Many Quests. There are 50 in total, detailing adventures from simple fetch quests to saving the world from the apocalypse!

It all starts with a quest card, which details the challenge you set forth upon. In the description are places for creatures and items. Draw the necessary cards to fill out your quest!

Once you have a quest in hand, draw the necessary number of Creature Cards and Item Cards to fill out its description. There are 75 of each to choose from!

Creature cards fill your quests with deadly foes, bitter rivals, and helpful allies. Will your contact be a family of gnomes or an all-powerful lich?

Item cards provide you with treasure to strive for, and tools to survive. Everything from a mundane bag of beans to the game changing Robe of the Tesseract!
Some of your results may seem nonsensical at first. Why would a cat-sized dragon be the mayor of a town, after all? In those cases, you can either draw different cards or take it as a world-building opportunity and make sense of it all!

Every card in The Deck of Many Quests has a star-rating. These ratings indicate how difficult a quest is, how much threat a creature can pose, and how rare or game-affecting an item can be. 
Feel free to separate your cards by star-rating to provide a leveled experience, or mix-and-match for interesting and unpredictable results!

Our first project was so successful on Kickstarter Graphic Cheatsheet 1, we (@Fundamentool) decided to return with another deck! Have a look!Our goal is to create a functional purpose within a deck of playing cards (so not just cards with a pretty face! ?), we wanted to keep the color aspect (as we think color naturally helps spark inspiration and creates a mood) and also some how integrate useful references that can be used on a daily basis, whether you are a Graphic Designer or someone who maybe look into that career pathway. At the same time we wanted to keep things simple so that anyone who picks up this deck can instantly understand its purpose (that is quite a challenging checklist!).  After testing several concepts, we ended up with The Palettes.This time we used color palettes and combined it with useful and commonly used graphic terms, these infographic court cards will give Graphic Designers a quick and illustrative reference which they can use to share with their clients so they can quickly and easily understand these terms (this also helps get your client involved and interacting in the design process!), but most importantly, this means more time can be spent on Design! Have a look to see how we achieved this. Looking forward to seeing where this takes us, we hope to see your support! Features

Custom-Designed playing cards.

Custom Courts with illustrative diagrams and descriptions.

Custom Numbered Cards with hand selected color palettes on every card.

Two-Way Custom Backs which incorporates the face color palettes! (Consistency is everying!)
Printed in the USA by USPCC (United States Playing Card Company) with Traditional Cut.
Fulfilment in the USA by Murphy's Magic (Experts in shipping efficiency so you get these quicker!).
Shipment estimated to begin in July 2021.
The tuck box is an extension of the colored palettes from the numbered cards, the layout and design of the tuckbox is also reminiscent of the V1 tuckbox, we wanted to create a certain consistency between the two decks so visually they fit comfortably together. The Backs features the integration of the front color palettes which further develops into into a 2-way back design. The Numbered cards have been designed into integrate a set of 5 colors, with each card having a different set of color combinations. These will provide color themed inspirations for when searching for a group of colors to implement into your design. The CMYK code is provided for each color, so you can match exactly that color.

<h2>Queeng Playing Cards v2.0 </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>The first ever, multi-ethnic deck of cards where men and women are equal.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Story, </h3>
<p><strong>Queeng Playing​ Cards</strong> is a project that my father and I started on a family vacation 3 years ago. </p>
<p>We were relaxing by playing a game of gin rummy when I turned to my dad and asked <i><u>“Why is the queen card worth less than the king?” </u></i></p>
<p>It was an innocent question, but when my dad couldn't come up with a good enough answer, we decided to do something about it. <strong>I created a new card system where the kings and queens are equal</strong>, but we still end up with a winner.  We swapped two jacks for lovely princesses and designed a female joker, and it was incredibly successful!</p>
<p>In just one year, we sold more than <strong>50,000 decks to 15,000</strong> backers all over the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611244457/s9gksuw08agji3girqyd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You might be wondering why I am calling this ""Part 2"" of the story.</p>
<p>Well, <strong>though we got a lot of great feedback, we also heard from some supporters that our cards were not <i>actually</i> totally equal.</strong> I realized that a diversified representation of ethnicities wasn’t there, like it doesn't exist. This doesn’t actually represent the people of the world as we really are, and if we are going to give kids these cards to hold in their hands and play with, <i>don't we want them to see an accurate depiction of the world?!</i></p>
<p><strong><u>So here we are, at part 2! </u></strong></p>
<p>We went back to the drawing board and started from scratch. We wanted to make a deck that truly represents our world and celebrates our beautiful range of cultures and appearances! </p>
<p>And so, <i><strong>I created the first ever multi-ethnic deck of cards, where, once again, men and women are equal but now with more colors and characteristics.</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>Queeng</strong> is an updated version of the classic deck of playing cards, but still works with ALL the original principles, so you can play ANY card game with it. </p>
<p>With its attention to detail and gorgeous, hand-drawn illustrations, each deck is as special as the encouraging message it brings to the world ❤</p>

<p>Dangerous Destinations is the definitive guide to creating intriguing and dynamic destinations for storytelling and fantasy roleplaying games. Following the same model as our best selling book, 'Spectacular Settlements', Dangerous Destinations contains an easy-to-use, step by step builder system.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613165706/rblrsz6xlypfttb3viol.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Start with one of twelve destination types, each of which has multiple variables that flesh out unique aspects of that destination. Next, place that destination in one of twelve environments, and continue the process of adding more and more detail. Then, discover the particular danger that exists within the destination created, including beasts, monsters, humanoids, magic, and events. Each danger has its own distinct flavor and modifiers, and each step in the process creates a more and more unique destination, even establishing plot hooks and many different motivations for quests.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613165765/xozm6qff9px0obx1ybmz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Use Dangerous Destinations either as a planning tool, before your game session, or on the fly, to create unique locations for encounters, be they as simple as a troll’s den near the edge of a forest, or a vast labyrinth built deep underground by some long-forgotten culture. Our goal is to offer inspiration when creating locations within your fantasy world that are not only intriguing, but also exist regardless of interaction from the player characters. This helps to bring the world to life and enhance your storytelling.</p>

Next, place that destination in one of twelve environments, and continue the process of adding more and more detail. Then, discover the particular danger that exists within the destination created, including beasts, monsters, humanoids, magic, and events. Each danger has its own distinct flavor and modifiers, and each step in the process creates a more and more unique destination, even establishing plot hooks and many different motivations for quests.

Use Dangerous Destinations either as a planning tool, before your game session, or on the fly, to create unique locations for encounters, be they as simple as a troll’s den near the edge of a forest, or a vast labyrinth built deep underground by some long-forgotten culture. Our goal is to offer inspiration when creating locations within your fantasy world that are not only intriguing, but also exist regardless of interaction from the player characters. This helps to bring the world to life and enhance your storytelling.



1. Destinations. A comprehensive selection of destination types including: burial grounds, camps, fortresses, headquarters, hideouts, outposts, religious sites, and many more.

2. Environments. All of the standard environments found in most tabletop roleplaying games. These include: aquatic, coastal, desert, forest, jungle, mountains, plains, swamp, tundra, underground, urban, and extra-planar. 

3. Dangers. From epic events, maniacal monsters, and vengeful villains, a myriad of possible dangers await your heroes.

4. Antagonists. From the bandit leader to the campaign villain, this section of the book has a vast selection of antagonists.

5. Pre-Generated Destinations. Need a destination now? Select from a huge variety created by our design team. Complete with overviews and exposition.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

I’m one of the creators of this game and I’ve been playing Memory Card Games since the age of 5 when my family emigrated to Canada. My grandparents would send me PEXESO - sheets of matching cards which my older sister would cut into squares. I remember being good at the game despite being the youngest in the family. I remember cards featuring dog and horse breeds, castles and capitals of the world and my favourite cartoon figures. As the game was fun, learning and remembering were effortless and joyful. To this day, I still know that poodles don’t look at all like bulldogs, gazelles are not antelopes, Caracas and Calcutta are on different continents, Montevideo is the capital of Uruguay, there are lots of castles in Bohemia and my favourite horse is still the Clydesdale. Memory works in mysterious ways!</p><p>So when COVID shut down our travel business, we had to ask ourselves ""What now?!"". While self-isolating in our 'motorhome bubble', we spent September on a road-trip exploring the natural beauty and history of Yukon Territory and northern British Columbia and playing European Memory Card Games each evening with our daughter. In the heat of the game, one of us suggested Memory Card Games should become more available in North America as they are in Europe and Asia, where they’ve become a standard learning aid for children, an opportunity for all ages to play a quick, easy game and a popular souvenir and gift.</p><p>Since that first spark, we’ve been on fire, working full time on this project, without pay, investing our own savings, covering living expenses with COVID subsidies from our Canadian government.  So here we are, five months later, with our first game. Hurray!</p><p>WE WERE INTERVIEWED on CBC RADIO'S ""ON THE COAST"".

The sources for these images were poetic, seasonal, literary, etc., and depicted everything from flowers to noblemen peeking into a room. The inside of a shell was first cleaned, then gilded and painted. Only the outside of the shell retained its natural look. The most common way of playing PAIRS is to mix all cards face down and arrange them in a grid. Players then flip two cards face up over each turn in search of a matching pair. If a player finds a pair, they get another turn. The object of the game is to find the most pairs.PAIRS is best played by 2, 3, or 4 players and takes about 25 minutes with the full set of 90 cards (45 pairs). We suggest that the very young and those not so young start playing with fewer pairs. Warning: Team play with 6 players can get rowdy. You can also play solo to test/train your memory. The game is fast-paced, competitive, and requires strategic thinking. 

 
Hi. I’m one of the creators of this game and I’ve been playing Memory Card Games since the age of 5 when my family emigrated to Canada. My grandparents would send me PEXESO - sheets of matching cards which my older sister would cut into squares. I remember being good at the game despite being the youngest in the family. I remember cards featuring dog and horse breeds, castles and capitals of the world and my favourite cartoon figures. As the game was fun, learning and remembering were effortless and joyful. To this day, I still know that poodles don’t look at all like bulldogs, gazelles are not antelopes, Caracas and Calcutta are on different continents, Montevideo is the capital of Uruguay, there are lots of castles in Bohemia and my favourite horse is still the Clydesdale. Memory works in mysterious ways!So when COVID shut down our travel business, we had to ask ourselves ""What now?!"". While self-isolating in our 'motorhome bubble', we spent September on a road-trip exploring the natural beauty and history of Yukon Territory and northern British Columbia and playing European Memory Card Games each evening with our daughter. In the heat of the game, one of us suggested Memory Card Games should become more available in North America as they are in Europe and Asia, where they’ve become a standard learning aid for children, an opportunity for all ages to play a quick, easy game and a popular souvenir and gift.Since that first spark, we’ve been on fire, working full time on this project, without pay, investing our own savings, covering living expenses with COVID subsidies from our Canadian government.  So here we are, five months later, with our first game. Hurray!WE WERE INTERVIEWED on CBC RADIO'S ""ON THE COAST"". Copy this link into your browser to hear the interview:  https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-46/clip/15828732We’d like to thank our American friends, Scott and Morgan at JOVIAL GRAPHICS, for their patience and great design work and for guiding us through the production and printing process. Special thanks also go to Adrian at ECHOSITES Website Design, Ina and Manuel at KASHU Studio for the explainer video, and Jeannie at our printing company whose efforts to produce a quality product will be appreciated by all.All photos featured in our game were taken by us - the founders of Pairs Unlimited.We are avid RV travellers, hikers and passionate photographers.The photos represent a selection of personal favourites - places we love and want to share. The Cards - quantity, size and quality matters:
90 cards: 3x3”(76x76mm), 0.04”(1mm) thick
High-resolution colour photos
Glossy varnish on both sides
Location titles on each card
The Guidebook - 20 pages in colour:
Facts and a bit of history about each location
How to Play includes the dizzying “Spot the Pair”. 
The Box - simple, elegant design:
Sturdy 1500gsm cardboard
157gsm art paper. Glossy finish
Telescopic lid for ease of opening
Worthy of any coffee table

Al momento de cierre, estábamos en proceso de colección de autorización de uso de imágenes, y explorando alianzas con fundaciones que tienen nuestros mismos objetivos, todo esto previo a la manufactura y comercialización de la colección. Además, iniciábamos el proceso de diseño de otras piezas de nuestra colección permanente, que celebra Latinoamérica desde una perspectiva más integral y amplia.
