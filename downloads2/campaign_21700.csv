<h3><i>Some are born great;</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Project Nongenue started with a dream of representation and deep commitment to classical text. </strong>In 2017, a group of like-minded individuals broke open the Los Angeles classical theater scene with a critically acclaimed all-women production of Julius Caesar in an Echo Park parking lot. Since then, Project Nongenue has only grown in skill, ambition and hunger to create and perform deeply underrepresented narratives within Los Angeles theater and the entertainment industry at large - focusing on the ancient texts and stories which have shaped western society. <strong>At this poignant historical moment, we are bringing the Nongenue lens to Shakespeare's beloved Twelfth Night - opting to use its alternative title in our alternative examination of it: What You Will.</strong></p>
<p>Shakespeare's Twelfth Night begins with a shipwreck that disrupts everything - creating a leading lady who crossdresses for survival, social elites who accidentally fall in love with members of the ""wrong"" gender, a servant who courts a duchess, and other social anarchies. <strong>Historically, productions have often regarded the instances of queerness and gender non-conforming behavior in this play as the butt of a joke, but our production of What You Will instead centers an earnest exploration these unconventional desires, bodies and identities. </strong>This play will shed light on the often invisible machinations of gender and sexuality, and challenge us to consider what our own desires might look like in a world with less restrictive norms.</p>
<p><strong>Classical theater, historically, has not been a safe or understanding place for queer people, people of color or, more generally, people who differ from the dominant population. </strong>Because of this, we have become accustomed to a type of storytelling which leaves many of our identities and experiences. Your support for this project allows us to offer the world a new story - one that brings you, and many more of us, to the table. This is big stuff.</p>

We're Coffee &amp; Whiskey Productions, the awesomest group of theatre nerds this side of the Antilles. Coffee &amp; Whiskey was founded in 2014 by playwrights Nic Wehrwein and Matt Diel, with one purpose—reforming the old, less-than-helpful “moderated talkback” model of play readings, and creating something of real value for playwrights. The goal, ultimately, is to change the conversations that happen during new play development. Making them better... stronger... faster. We can rebuild them. We have the technology.</p><p><strong>The Script Pub</strong></p><p>The Script Pub is the heart of the C&amp;W enterprise; it is the central load-bearing wall of our Sears catalog pre-fab theatrical house. We take a play, put it on its feet, and give it a semi-staged, script-in-hand performance. Afterwards, we ask one simple question of the audience: <i>What did you think?</i> From there, we have a good, unscripted conversation, designed to help the playwright move their work forward.</p><p>Over the last 3 seasons, we've been fortunate to present some pretty freakin' fantastic plays from some pretty freakin' fantastic playwrights (including O'Neill finalists, National Latino Playwrighting Award Winners, and fancypants Kilroy Listers), and we’ve learned a lot about our process along the way. We’ve gotten to spend time with giraffes, eat ice cream with alcoholic clowns, and be consumed by Pez; we’ve explored visions of the future, memories of the past, and seen intersex fish in the present day (hey, trout!). All told, it’s been one hell of a ride so far, and we’d like your help to keep it going.</p><p><strong>Where You Come In</strong></p><p>What we're in search of is a gigantic pile of money. Once obtained, we will take that pile of money and place it in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and dive in a la Scrooge McDuck. Once we finish doing that, we will take the money out of the pool and exchange it for goods and services. Thus will the 2017 Coffee &amp; Whiskey Script Pub be born!</p><p>Seriously though, each and every Script Pub requires money for stuff, like:</p><ul>
<li>theatre space</li>
<li>rehearsal space</li>
<li>the time and talent of the actors and directors</li>
<li>a surprising amount of pizza</li>
</ul><p>We have thus far been able to fund Coffee &amp; Whiskey’s activities through audience donations, a few generous sponsors, and by scrounging loose change from the couch. But now it’s time to step up, and take it to the next level, and win one for the Gipper, or something. Every red cent that we earn from this wacky funding endeavor will go directly to funding Coffee &amp; Whiskey.

</ul><p> </p></div>","The BasicsHi there! We're Coffee & Whiskey Productions, the awesomest group of theatre nerds this side of the Antilles. Coffee & Whiskey was founded in 2014 by playwrights Nic Wehrwein and Matt Diel, with one purpose—reforming the old, less-than-helpful “moderated talkback” model of play readings, and creating something of real value for playwrights. The goal, ultimately, is to change the conversations that happen during new play development. Making them better... stronger... faster. We can rebuild them. We have the technology.The Script PubThe Script Pub is the heart of the C&W enterprise; it is the central load-bearing wall of our Sears catalog pre-fab theatrical house. We take a play, put it on its feet, and give it a semi-staged, script-in-hand performance. Afterwards, we ask one simple question of the audience: What did you think? From there, we have a good, unscripted conversation, designed to help the playwright move their work forward.Over the last 3 seasons, we've been fortunate to present some pretty freakin' fantastic plays from some pretty freakin' fantastic playwrights (including O'Neill finalists, National Latino Playwrighting Award Winners, and fancypants Kilroy Listers), and we’ve learned a lot about our process along the way. We’ve gotten to spend time with giraffes, eat ice cream with alcoholic clowns, and be consumed by Pez; we’ve explored visions of the future, memories of the past, and seen intersex fish in the present day (hey, trout!). All told, it’s been one hell of a ride so far, and we’d like your help to keep it going.Where You Come InWhat we're in search of is a gigantic pile of money. Once obtained, we will take that pile of money and place it in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and dive in a la Scrooge McDuck. Once we finish doing that, we will take the money out of the pool and exchange it for goods and services. Thus will the 2017 Coffee & Whiskey Script Pub be born!Seriously though, each and every Script Pub requires money for stuff, like:
theatre space
rehearsal space
the time and talent of the actors and directors
a surprising amount of pizza
We have thus far been able to fund Coffee & Whiskey’s activities through audience donations, a few generous sponsors, and by scrounging loose change from the couch. But now it’s time to step up, and take it to the next level, and win one for the Gipper, or something. Every red cent that we earn from this wacky funding endeavor will go directly to funding Coffee & Whiskey. If we net ourselves five grand, or fifty bucks, or even a measly two bits, it will help us continue the work.And lest you think this is merely an exercise in altruism, fret not, cause we've got amazing perks for you! Stickers and T-shirts and mugs and maybe even baked goods! You get some sweet swag, and we get to keep doing what we love to do. It's a win-win, really.Why It’s Important""Theatre is Conversation"" is more than just a pithy motto—it’s our guiding principle.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Aleixa Freire + Molly Kennedy are a collaborative, choreographic performance entity rooted in contemporary dance. Together we create and perform work that seeks to intertwine virtuosic, highly physical dance forms with narratives connected to questions of deeper socio-political implication. <a href=""https://www.aleixamollydance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.aleixamollydance.com</a></p>
<p><strong><i>BEAUTIFUL FEELINGS</i></strong> is our new evening length work premiering February 1st &amp; 2nd, 2020 at Center for Performance Research in Brooklyn, NY. <i>BEAUTIFUL FEELINGS </i> researches the ideas of connectivity in societal structures. How would the world be a different place if we each really knew one another? The work seeks to express how the physical language of our moving bodies can facilitate the creation of empathy and visibility. We are also studying rage and how we negotiate the expression or suppression of complex emotions. The exploration of how societal structures impose the image of perfection and how its intangibility creates an apathetic regard towards self and therefore towards others. Can candid emotional expression and sensitivity bring us closer towards inner and communal peace?</p>
<p>Dancers: Caylee Shimizu, Indigo Sparks, Alex Schmidt, Haley Sung, Shelby Nelson, Lindsay Wenning.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hi, we're the Wise Fish Theater Collective! Thank you for visiting our campaign page. As an intro, here are the fundamental tenants of our collective, or, what makes us Wise Fish and not fishbrains: <span style=""font-family: 'Antenna Cond Black', Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.1;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

<p><span>Catherine has sacrificed her education and social life to care for her father Robert, a once brilliant mathematician. </span></p>
<p>Following his death Catherine is now plagued with fears for her own mental health whilst dealing with the trauma of his passing and the attentions of his former student, Hal.</p>
<p><span>Hal desperately searches through the professor's notebooks hoping to discover something useable among his incoherent scribblings.</span></p>
<p>With the arrival of her estranged sister Claire, past pains and prejudices surface and the appearance of a brilliant proof, which Catherine claims to have written, ignites the doubts and tests the loyalties and love of all three.</p>

<p>In this country we have a growing tendency to ignore and victimise the weak, as demonstrated through Austerity. Amongst others, the disabled have suffered horribly but if the majority of people actually understood what it is to live with a disability – this abuse wouldn’t happen.</p>

</div></div>","The Play
Proof is a beautiful Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Auburn about the effects of mental illness on a family.
It will be performed at The Tabard Theatre (Chiswick, London) for 4 weeks starting 29 September 2015. 

SYNOPSIS
Catherine has sacrificed her education and social life to care for her father Robert, a once brilliant mathematician. 
Following his death Catherine is now plagued with fears for her own mental health whilst dealing with the trauma of his passing and the attentions of his former student, Hal.
Hal desperately searches through the professor's notebooks hoping to discover something useable among his incoherent scribblings.
With the arrival of her estranged sister Claire, past pains and prejudices surface and the appearance of a brilliant proof, which Catherine claims to have written, ignites the doubts and tests the loyalties and love of all three.
Collaboration

We are delighted to announce that we will be collaborating with the charity Sane.

 
SANE is a leading UK mental health charity improving quality of life for anyone affected by mental illness - including family friends and carers.

Through us you will be helping to raise
awareness about Mental illness and supporting the wonderful charity SANE with
whom we are partnered for this production. Proof deals with a very personal
exploration of mental illness and its impact upon the family – it is our honour
to be able to promote SANE in our efforts to connect theatre in a direct and
practical way with raising awareness.

What We Need 

Proof is a wonderful play that we are all very passionate about and can't wait to share it with an audience. We would like to use the money we raise here for advertising the show. This is important for two reasons:

The more people know about this play the more people we can reach with its important messages and raise awareness about mental illness. We are hoping to transfer the play to a bigger venue next year but this can only happen if we can show the management of the potential new venue that many people are interested. The best way to ensure this is to have a sell-out run.

All the cast and crew have kindly agreed to work on a profit-share basis, meaning that nobody will get a fixed fee. We will split the profit from the box office at the end. The more people who know about this show, the more tickets we can sell to make sure that our talented team will be compensated for their hard work.



 
Why Support Us?
1/ Art is one of the last pure conduits through which we as a people can reflect upon the human condition; it is a vital tool through which expression is given genuine freedom. We aim to produce plays which reach for people; that move them and hopefully leave them looking more closely at themselves and the world around them. In short, we hope to breed empathy and without this, without the ability to see and emotionally understand other people; other situations – what do we risk becoming?
In this country we have a growing tendency to ignore and victimise the weak, as demonstrated through Austerity. Amongst others, the disabled have suffered horribly but if the majority of people actually understood what it is to live with a disability – this abuse wouldn’t happen.
2/ Through us you will be helping to raise awareness about Mental illness and supporting the wonderful charity SANE with whom we are partnered for this production.

<h3>What's The Tarot Reading?</h3>
<p>We created The Tarot Reading to be a home for artists and entertainers of all stripes where audiences could always leave with something unforgettable. We wanted our artists and our audiences to feel like they had something at stake in their creation - that we could have fun, but also make a difference. Since it's inception, over 20 unique artists have created over 60 singular acts and formed over 300 personal memories in three awesome performances. Funding The Tarot Reading continues that goal, and creates space where that magic can happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's It Going Toward?</h3>
<div><p>The full amount of this campaign goes to supporting our artists with fees, commissions and cost of materials. If we don't complete our goal, the artists will (always) get paid first.</p></div>
</div><div>
<h3>What's The Impact?</h3>
<p>The Tarot Reading is always offered to audiences for a sacrifice of anything. It can be monetary, but doesn't have to be. We pay our artists for their valuable time and expertise, and do so with over 60%(!) of our earned income from generous sacrifices. </p>
<p>We ask you now to make us another, pre-sacrifice so our Revelations can always find exactly who they need to without cost being a barrier. Give to The Tarot Reading so we can continue to commission the area's best artists to create sensational, interpersonal shows-for-one-and-many.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Can't Give To The Tarot?</h3>
<p>There is one simple thing you can do to help out. All you have to do is tell one person - just one! - about your experience with us. Tell them what happened, tell them what excited you, tell them what you were left feeling and thinking and holding afterward. Then, point them here.</p>

Performance dates:  Sept. 20, 21 8:00 pm, Sept. 22 7:00 pm, Sept. 27, 28 8:00 pm, Sept. 29 7:00pm.  Tickets at https://joseph-walsh-play.square.site/
 
What We Need & What You Get
Like most independent productions, What's in Front of You is self-financed and produced.  To fund all planned performances, our goal is to raise $4,000.00 for remaining costs.
The funds raised will go toward theater rental costs, rehearsal space, fees for technical support and Stage Manager(s), expenses incurred by our Production Team and the care and feeding of our performers throughout the run.
For this we need YOU!  People who care about theater, new theater, funny theater, weird theater, experimental theater, independent theater; who care about laughter, tears, awe, language, character, surprise, refinement, offense!

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I enjoy creating dance works for both film and the stage, whether dramatically charged emotional stories, cheeky humorous pieces, or more meditative, abstract works. I love crafting complex ensemble patterns and setting intricate partnering that doesn’t need to conform to gender norms.</p>
<p>This will be an important aspect of my new work “Come Out Swinging”, a fun, high-energy piece inspired by a brief scene in the Wonder Woman movie where Diana claims the slow-dancing townspeople are merely swaying not dancing. So now I will combine two of my favorite loves (dance and comics) to answer the question: How do the Amazons of Themyscaria dance?</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b>Where the money goes:</b></span></p>
<p>I am asking for $1,000 which will pay for transportation to and from New Jersey for all the dancers, a stipend for performance, as well as food since it is an all day event.

<p>And since I want this to be step 1 for this work, I have a few stretch goals:</p>

<li>$1,250 Drone Footage! With just a little extra I will be able to provide drone footage of the work which should offer a great view of the dancer's interaction with the hedge mazes.</li>
<li>$1,500 Photoshoot! Push forward a little more with the funding and I'll be able to host a fantastic photoshoot on Governor's Island. </li>
<li>$2,000 Flash Mob outside Comic-Con! Since the initial version of the work will be site specific, I'll need to host some extra rehearsals, as well as pay dancers for another performance.</li>
<li>$2,250 Amazon headgear! I am not currently adding any armored headgear to the dancers wardrobes. But if I reach this goal, I'll be able to add some cut throat tiaras. Who doesn't love a tiara that doubles as a weapon?</li>
<li>$3,000 Video! If we reach this level, I will make a professional level video that takes elements of the dance, but will showcase it in a format that is best suited for video vs. a live performance. </li>

<p>I have been self-funding my work for the last 2 years, so no matter what is raised, the dancers will be paid.

<strong>Hello</strong>!</h3>
<p>We are Eleanor Westbrook (singing, clown-y type theatre-making musician woman) and Livvy Lynch (performance/sound/video artist). We are taking two new solo shows to Edinburgh Fringe and sharing a full run at the festival. We will perform on alternating nights in La Vida Room 3 from the 4th - 25th August.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Livvy's Big Bird is a fast-paced multi-media show about a sub-human, more-than-human, city-dwelling pigeon whose wings don’t work. In a style that mixes tragedy with absurdity, the links between mental distress and neoliberalism are explored through voice, video and live-looping.​</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Ellie’s Big Berg is a surreal adventure into antarctic exploration. It’s also a pondering on the meaning of life. It’s also really silly.

<p> </p>
<p>We are two artists who respect and want to support each other’s work, and we’re basically just asking for some help to pay for it. We have a long run with a lot of outgoing expenses and your (wonderfully generous) donation will help us cover the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Promo: flyers &amp; posters (a LOT of flyers and posters waft their way around the fringe, so we need to try and keep on top of the paper wave).</p></li>
<li><p>To be in the official digital programme.</p></li>
<li><p>Our travel costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Lighting hire (our venue is not a theatre space so we have to glam it up ourselves).</p></li>
<li><p>Props/costume.</p></li>
<li><p> </p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t make our goal, <strong>we will still perform</strong>. We will use whatever is raised to pay to be in the programme (£295.20), and use personal funds to cover the rest. The difference your donation can make is to render other purchases less of an obstacle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve been working really hard on making these new shows, and getting the word out is so important. It would be a shame to perform to no-one as we feel there is value in what we are bringing to the festival (a fundamental need for big laugh in face of big sad). If you are able to contribute anything, whatever the amount, it would go towards our presence on the scene and our learning &amp; sharing as artists/makers/performers/human beings as a whole.<i> (Just so you know, your taxes are going towards the Queen’s morning tit massage, so why not fund some art...?)</i></p>
<p>If you cannot make a contribution right now (maybe you’ve just spent your entire salary on a single cashew nut?), we understand. You can still help by making some NOISE about our shows.

    About the Show

Janet Cole Valdez, Deedee O’Malley and Bettie Ross are multi-award winning writers and composers. Together they have created WAITING FOR JOHNNY DEPP, inspired by true experiences in the entertainment industry.
WAITING FOR JOHNNY DEPP takes us on a wild ride with New York actress Rita Donatella, in her quest to land the role of a lifetime in a Johnny Depp film.   She constantly re-invents herself to be more perfect for the role, as she navigates the rough waters of surviving in the big apple with her dream intact.   It is both hilarious and heartwarming, to see how Rita comes to terms with the big questions:  how to survive financially, how to recognize true love, how to balance the demands of career and family, and ultimately, what is really important in life?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is an Independent Student Production at the University of Southern California. What that means is everything about this show is student organized, student run, and student produced. At USC, we are always challenged to take initiative and push ourselves to what we can create and do. This production is a perfect opportunity to showcase just that, but we cannot do that alone. That's why we are reaching out to all of you: friends, family, classmates, random people we've met in the elevator, all of you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for this show to reach it's full potential, we need help from all of you guys to afford the lighting, set design, and costuming for this show. Our goal is to reach $2,000 so the designers can afford the best proper materials to make this show as great as it can be.</p>
<p>You can think of your donation as your admission. As an independent student production, we have a ""suggested"" $5 ticket admission price, but any donations of a higher value can secure you at least one ticket on any night of your choosing. Other perks can include: mentions as donors and backers of this wonderful show in the program distributed at every performance, thank you videos from the cast and crew, and preferred seating at a performance of your choosing.</p>
<p>If in the unfortunate case we do not reach our total goal of $2,000 we will still do everything in our power to help the designers afford the materials they need. However, it would be terrific to see many different people donate to this cause and show their love and support for the arts. The cast and crew consists of 16 people total. If each person reached out to 10 friends, and all their friends donated $10, we would only be $400 short of our goal, and that's incredible to think about! Such a small personal donation can make the world of difference to those of us working on this production. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The People You Are Helping</strong></p>
<p>The cast and crew of this show who need your help are:</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At USC, students have the opportunity to work on shows fully funded by the school and directed, designed, and produced by professors and guest directors brought in from the LA area. What's special about Independent Student Productions like this one is they challenge and encourage students to produce everything by themselves. There are no academic advisors, or directorial help by professors during the process, but rather everything is created and collaborated by the students themselves. From rehearsals, to designing, to acquiring materials and resources, through to the final performance, it is 100% student run and organized, and provides everyone involved with a unique learning opportunity that cannot be achieved through other shows.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford any donations at this time, not to worry! Something that is just as helpful is awareness about this fund and campaign, so please share this on any social media platform you're on, as well as when you have the chance to talk about with friends, family, classmates, co-workers, etc. The more people hear about this campaign, the less each individual needs to donate to achieve our goal, and the easier it can be to come together as a community and help make this production a hit.</p>

THE HOOK…











Every theater company has its angle.  Hook & Eye builds plays collectively with our ""cloud"" of artists. The Summoners is being created in four phases:

Phase One (completed! Partially funded by your previous donations, thank you!):
In July, we headed out to a lovely farm in Pennsylvania - a creative army of ten - to build a new piece. What resulted is a moving examination of modern America, corporate intrusion, and the current state of hope


Phase Two (completed):

We just finished the Script Workshop of The Summoners in October. Our playwright, Gavin Broady (who wrote so brilliantly for all three of last year’s PlayLabs) is working on revisions. The company will convene on November 13th for a final read-through before we head into pre-production and rehearsal
Phase Three (RIGHT NOW!):

FUNDRAISING. The costs involved to make a piece of original theater and bring it to the stage are surprisingly high. We'd like to share with you exactly where your generous contributions will go.
Phase Four (January 2014):


The Summoners will run January 21-February 1, 2014 at the C.O.W Theater on Manhattan's Lower East Side!




THE EYE...

Chaski's provide a transatlantic platform for
outstanding work from the Americas largely unknown to the UK. We work with text
from North, South and Central America, but giving a UK platform to Latino
playwrights is also a central part our work. 
This debut performance project is a one-night showcase of six extracts
taken from a shortlist of plays that have never before been seen on a London
stage!
Where's your money going?

This activity is our first step into a public performance, following years of research and development and countless meetings and workshops. Your support will help us to take this first step with confidence and security, helping us to cover the cost of rehearsal space, set demands, marketing and to pay the artists involved and our cast of eight. We intend to divide funds as follows:
Rehearsal space: £900
Fees for production staff: £750
Director & cast travel expenses: £1100
Set, costume and props: £500
Marketing: £150
Contingency and other fees: £300

Come and see the results!

New World Playwrights - A Night of Unwriting 
Cockpit Theatre, 14th Dec. Book tickets here.

Featuring work by: Migdalia Cruz, Octavio Solis, Matthew Paul Olmos, Mariana Carreño
King, Pedro Miguel Rozo and Nate Rufus Edelman, as well as text from Pulitzer
Prize winner Nilo Cruz.
The showcase will give us the opportunity to physically engage in the staging of these plays and to present them in front of an audience - including peers, press and producers. We want to evidence the fact that there is a place for these texts here and to use our skills as artists to serve them in the best possible way to a British audience. Our achievements here will set Chaski's well on its path to a full production in 2015 and to further enriching the UK with a constant stream of outstanding American text. 
The event is truly a seed that we now need to plant, the first step into solidly establishing our company, to tell stories that need to be told.

<p>2020 is just around the corner, but the World Dance Instructor Survey is still using 1990 technology.  And it takes a long time to get our results.  We will hire a developer to bring this process to your phone or tablet, let you enter your teaches as you go, and get results almost instantly (by the end of the project.)   Currently many instructors send in their teaches to regional collectors who will continue to offer that service for those not connected to technology. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for seed money to fund the first phase of the development.  $2500 will pay for the design, initial coding and testing phase of developing the app.  Most features of the app will be free for everyone.  We might find some features that will be more expensive to offer and additional funding will be sought for that phase. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We already collect teaches from over 200 instructors around the world, but this app has the potential to increase that 10 times.  It also will be able to break down reports regionally and give instructors more details that they can truly use to make their classes the best in town!</p>
<p>It will encourage instructors to try new exciting dancers and encourage the best choreographers to keep working hard. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know apps can have glitches when they first launch.  We hope to set expectations that we will need everyone to help us test and work out the kinks.  This is a project for and by the dance community.  </p>

<p>In 2015, we presented a
site-specific world premiere of FLOYDADA, Barry Rowell’s play about two
eccentric, middle-aged sisters in 1927 Texas. Dalia, a terminally ill artist,
and Ada, the dutiful caretaker, are forced together again after years apart.
Unwilling to sit around and wait to die, Dalia shakes up her sister’s mundane
existence by convincing her to open a Dada-inspired cabaret in the family’s
empty storefront. <i>Floydada </i>was a
finalist in the 2011 Texas Playwrights Festival.</p>
<p>The response from the press
and audiences was so enthusiastic that we are reconfiguring the production for
traditional theater spaces and working with companies and festivals outside of
NYC—including Great Escape Stage Company in Marshall, MI—to bring FLOYDADA to
their audiences. We had an enormous raw storefront space for the premiere—so
large, we were able to include an art gallery as part of the event. For the
“portable” version, the team is retooling the video, staging, sets, and music
to work in a more compact, intimate environment—while still keeping a sense of
the huge expanse of the West Texas plains. To help with that, we’ve expanded
the sound effects in the play to make the aural experience grander and more
pervasive. We’ve also enhanced the set and projection screens to recreate some
of the scope that made the NYC production unique.</p>
<p>We’re entering the home
stretch now with a March 2016 workshop in The Lounge at Dixon Place in NYC.
Since we won’t be able to take everyone out on the road, the workshop gives the
team members two full days to really work on the show together and get it ready
to travel. We’ve raised over half of what we need; all we need to finish is at
least $3,000 to help us cover some of the expenses and stipends for all of the
artists.</p>
<p>We’re
SO-O-O-O close to a production that can be enjoyed by people around the country
and, eventually, around the world. Please HELP US reach our goals by donating
something—anything at all—right now.</p>

much.</p>

the huge expanse of the West Texas plains. To help with that, we’ve expanded
the sound effects in the play to make the aural experience grander and more
pervasive. We’ve also enhanced the set and projection screens to recreate some
of the scope that made the NYC production unique.
We’re entering the home
stretch now with a March 2016 workshop in The Lounge at Dixon Place in NYC.
Since we won’t be able to take everyone out on the road, the workshop gives the
team members two full days to really work on the show together and get it ready
to travel. We’ve raised over half of what we need; all we need to finish is at
least $3,000 to help us cover some of the expenses and stipends for all of the
artists.
We’re
SO-O-O-O close to a production that can be enjoyed by people around the country
and, eventually, around the world. Please HELP US reach our goals by donating
something—anything at all—right now.
Thank you so very, very
much.

<p>Since its

underground arts organization in Hungary that has gained reputation for its
politically reflective performances.The organization, that over the recent
years has become the artistic epicentre of the democratic movement in Hungary,
primarily produces stage performances and media art productions. It is led by
Árpád Schilling (artistic director) and Márton Gulyás (managing director).</p>
<p>As of 2010, Hungary slowly but surely has begun getting closer
authoritarianism, and has started resembling rather ang autocracy than a
pluralist, liberal democracy.The currently governing center-right party led by
PM Viktor Orbán has demolished the democratic institutions, and now has turned
against the non-partisan civil society organizations. It has blacklisted all
those organizations that are committed to defend human rights, democratic
values and individual freedom. Krétakör is at the top of its blacklist. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""247"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F100109067&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F100109067&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F481486436_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

Krétakör has gradually lost all its state funds. However, we consider it as a
success: our critical approach to depict politics compels us to remain

Hungarian government functions nowadays, so obviously we cannot be its
beneficiary either. This is one of the reasons why Krétakör is very dependent

(i.e.: loser) is a reconsidered concept of his earlier play `The Party` that
Krétakör staged in March 2014, just
a couple of days before the Parliamentary elections in Hungary. With his
provocative play, Schilling devoted himself to keep the nature of politics
under scrutiny. How does the Party take control? How can democracy become an
instrument of the ultimate power in the hand of the rulers? How could the Party
become a piece of breaking news day after day? Simply, how does the Party
operate and what it is good for? In 'The Party', Árpád Schilling invited
the audience to redefine their way of thinking about public life: both the
supporters of the current government and the skeptical members of the
opposition were addressed. </p>

</div><h3><span></span></h3><h3><span>Who we are</span></h3><p>We are Megan Rhyme and Elizabeth Hicks, two people from very different fields who share a similar goal: to collaborate across disciplines and investigate the connections between art and science. Megan is an independent choreographer in Chicago who has danced with Salty Lark Dance, Renegade Dance Architects, Synapse Arts Collective, and has produced work at the Chicago Fringe Festival, and Links Hall. You can find more about her work at <a href=""http://www.rhymedance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rhymedance.com</a>. Elizabeth is an astrophysicist who studies fluid dynamics.  She is also the founder of Epsilon Delta Labs (<a href=""http://www.epsilondeltalabs.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.epsilondeltalabs.org</a>), a research lab focused on interdisciplinary projects.  We met at a joint event between Northwestern Science and Society and the Art of Science Learning, which took place at the Museum of Science and Industry. We decided to collaborate on this project because we want audiences to see that art can happen anywhere and to show that dialogue between art and science can enhance both artistic and scientific inquiry. You can visit our project website at <a href=""http://epsilondeltalabs.org/far-from-equilibrium/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://epsilondeltalabs.org/far-from-equilibrium/</a> .</p><br/><p>Our project is an artistic exploration of turbulence. Turbulence is in most places in the universe: in cream stirred into coffee, in the raging, swirling flames of forest fires on Earth, and even in massive explosions of energy from the surface of our Sun. This chaotic, complex twisting and stretching of fluid is mysterious, even to scientists. “Far From Equilibrium” invites audiences to immerse themselves in the beauty of turbulence and consider uncertainty, complexity, and how motion underlies form. This dance will be presented as part of Science Works, an annual STEM career celebration held at the Museum of Science and Industry. Tickets are included with general museum entry and can be purchased at <a href=""http://www.msichicago.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.msichicago.org</a>. It is also a part of Chicago Artists Month, the 20th annual celebration of Chicago’s vibrant arts community presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events <a href=""http://www.chicagoartistsmonth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chicagoartistsmonth.org</a>.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441670098/pmlbslnan3tbihnr0u0f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping fund Chicago artists and building collaborations between arts and science. Our campaign funds are going directly to paying the dancers and artists involved in the project and production costs such as rehearsal space and costumes. By showing your support, you’re showing the world that art and science have a vibrant future together!</p><br/><h3>What We Need</h3><p></p><p><span>Our goal amount is $1500, which covers our necessary production costs, such as: </span></p><ul>
<li><p>Costumes - $150</p></li>
<li><p>AV setup at the Museum - $150</p></li>
<li><p>Audience engagement tools such as programs, signs, and turbulence experiments that audience members can play with after the performance - $200</p></li>
<li><p>Videography to record the performance - $300</p></li>
<li><p>Dancer stipends - $100 stipend per dancer x 7 dancers = $700</p></li>
</ul><p>Paying stipends to our dancers is very important to us, as they are the artists who are literally putting their brains and bodies to work to make this project possible.  We are going to pay a modest stipend of $100 to each dancer, which barely begins to cover the 50-60 hours worth of rehearsal time that they each put in!</p><p>We are very committed to the project and have already used our own personal funds to rent rehearsal space. If we don’t reach our goal, any funds we raise on Indiegogo will be going to cover dancer stipends and necessary production costs first and any remaining costs we will cover out of pocket. If we meet and can exceed our goal, there are some other costs that we would love to fund!

Megan is an independent choreographer in Chicago who has danced with Salty Lark Dance, Renegade Dance Architects, Synapse Arts Collective, and has produced work at the Chicago Fringe Festival, and Links Hall. You can find more about her work at www.rhymedance.com. Elizabeth is an astrophysicist who studies fluid dynamics.  She is also the founder of Epsilon Delta Labs (www.epsilondeltalabs.org), a research lab focused on interdisciplinary projects.  We met at a joint event between Northwestern Science and Society and the Art of Science Learning, which took place at the Museum of Science and Industry. We decided to collaborate on this project because we want audiences to see that art can happen anywhere and to show that dialogue between art and science can enhance both artistic and scientific inquiry. You can visit our project website at http://epsilondeltalabs.org/far-from-equilibrium/ .Our project is an artistic exploration of turbulence. Turbulence is in most places in the universe: in cream stirred into coffee, in the raging, swirling flames of forest fires on Earth, and even in massive explosions of energy from the surface of our Sun. This chaotic, complex twisting and stretching of fluid is mysterious, even to scientists. “Far From Equilibrium” invites audiences to immerse themselves in the beauty of turbulence and consider uncertainty, complexity, and how motion underlies form. This dance will be presented as part of Science Works, an annual STEM career celebration held at the Museum of Science and Industry. Tickets are included with general museum entry and can be purchased at www.msichicago.org. It is also a part of Chicago Artists Month, the 20th annual celebration of Chicago’s vibrant arts community presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events www.chicagoartistsmonth.org.  By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping fund Chicago artists and building collaborations between arts and science. Our campaign funds are going directly to paying the dancers and artists involved in the project and production costs such as rehearsal space and costumes. By showing your support, you’re showing the world that art and science have a vibrant future together!What We NeedOur goal amount is $1500, which covers our necessary production costs, such as: 
Costumes - $150
AV setup at the Museum - $150
Audience engagement tools such as programs, signs, and turbulence experiments that audience members can play with after the performance - $200
Videography to record the performance - $300
Dancer stipends - $100 stipend per dancer x 7 dancers = $700
Paying stipends to our dancers is very important to us, as they are the artists who are literally putting their brains and bodies to work to make this project possible.  We are going to pay a modest stipend of $100 to each dancer, which barely begins to cover the 50-60 hours worth of rehearsal time that they each put in!We are very committed to the project and have already used our own personal funds to rent rehearsal space. If we don’t reach our goal, any funds we raise on Indiegogo will be going to cover dancer stipends and necessary production costs first and any remaining costs we will cover out of pocket. If we meet and can exceed our goal, there are some other costs that we would love to fund! Those include upgrading the quantity and quality of our audience engagement tools and reimbursing ourselves for the cost of renting rehearsal space. Our perksWe have some fantastic perks for this project! All donations, regardless of the amount, will get recognition in our program. If you donate at one of the following levels, you will receive the perk for that level!
$20: Hand-made bookmark featuring the visual art of Elizabeth’s turbulence research

Our ChallengesThe unique and exciting opportunity to perform at the Museum of Science and Industry also means that we won't be earning ticket sales, a typical source of revenue for many performing artists and arts organizations. So your support would mean to world to us; it will allow us to pay our hard working dancers for their time and cover production costs such as costumes and AV rental. Megan’s company Rhyme/Dance is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization.That means that all your donations to this project are tax-deductible!  Contributions for the charitable purposes of Far From Equilibrium must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.

<h2>About the Samuel French OOB Festival</h2>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival started in 1975 and is Manhattan’s oldest, continuous short play festival.  In the first 36 years of the Festival, over 500 theatre companies and schools participated. Applicants included companies from coast to coast as well as abroad from Canada, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.  The Festival has given emerging playwrights the opportunity to have their work produced with the support of such theatres as The Public Theater, The Royal Court, Ensemble Studio Theatre,  The Flea Theatre, The Living Theatre and Naked Angels, and with the backing of prestigious university playwriting programs such as The New School for Drama, Columbia University, University of Iowa, and Tisch School of the Arts’ Dramatic Writing Program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Festival has served as a doorway to future success for many aspiring playwrights, and has helped launched the work of notables as  Theresa Rebeck, Shirley Lauro, Sheila Callaghan, Bekah Brunstetter, Steve Yockey, Saviana Stanescu, and David Johnston.  In many cases, Festival participation has sparked agent contracts for Festival finalists and all of the final forty plays selected to be perform in New York are guaranteed to be seen by an Artistic Director of a major theater, a professional playwright, and a theatrical agent.  Many past Festival playwrights have gone on to win major Playwriting awards and honors, as well as to have major theatrical productions of their works staged.</p>
<h2>How the Festival Works</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival is distinct in two ways: it requires applicants to collaborate with a producing organization and it offers a prize of publication in the notable OFF OFF BROADWAY FESTIVAL PLAYS series.  Though many of the works that play in the Festival have been developed under the wing of theatres, universities, and writer’s groups, many of the plays that are produced as part of the Festival are world premieres.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The application period for the Festival begins in late December/early January and lasts until early March.  Playwrights may submit up to three unpublished plays that may be performed in 30 minutes or less.  On their application, playwrights must cite the organization that will produce their play (at this early stage it is often the playwright themselves) and a liaison for Samuel French to contact with Festival information. Submissions are whittled down by the Festival editorial staff, and the Final Forty are chosen to present their play during Festival week.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Festival week consists of 6 performance sessions  in which 6 to 7 scripts are presented in front of a judging panel comprised of an Artistic Director, an agent, and a professional playwright.  At the end of each session, the judges deliberate and 1 to 2 plays are selected to move on to the Festival Finals.  Finals take places of the last of day of the Festival.  During the Finals, the Festival staff will watch the final twelve to fourteen plays and select six authors to be a published in a the OFF OFF BROADWAY FESTIVAL PLAYS series, which is published and licensed by Samuel French, Inc.</p>

<div>The London State Theater, built 79 years ago in 1936 in historic downtown London, Ohio, received a major facelift in 2010 by George Peyton. </div>
<div>But only two years after Mr. Peyton re-opened the theater, t<span style=""background-color: initial;"">echnology
changed. Movies aren’t distributed on film anymore. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>To keep running, The State needed a new digital projector. </p>
<p>
<span>With everything George had already put into
fixing up the State, the new projector was just one expense too many, and the
theater closed in January of 2013.</span><br/></p>
<p><span>Since the theater closed, the theater's roof has a sprung a few leaks. Portions of the ceiling plaster have collapsed from where water pooled. </span></p>
<p>There's no structural danger, but every expert we've had on the roof agrees that the roof needs to be replaced.</p>

We are raising $70,000 to re-open The State Theater in London.
It’s just a portion of the budget we need to get the place up and running
again but It’ll go a long way into helping us install a digital projector with
crystal-clear picture, and a roof that won't leak.</span></div>
<p></p> </div><div>
Your contribution, no matter the size, tells us
that we’re not alone in believing that downtown London needs to bring <i>fun</i> back!<br/>
</div><div>With your help, the State can be THE place to see first-run blockbuster movies, go on dates, visit with friends, and take the family.</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p><b>• Priority one: a projector<br/></b>Movies come as computer files now, and are played on digital projectors. The files are a proprietary format that protects the movie industry from piracy. Only three projector manufacturers (Christie, Sony, and NEC) make projectors capable of showing movies in the format sent for first-run movies.</p>
<p>We're looking to buy an NEC digital projector; a new, brighter, shinier screen - and having these professionally installed. The price to do so should cost about $40,000 to $43,000.</p>
<p><b>• Priority two: a new roof</b></p>
<p>We'd like people to be able to watch movies without needing an umbrella.</p>
<p>The roof has been patched so many times, that estimates for a temporary roof fix are nearly as much as the estimates for replacing the entire roof. </p>
<p>We project the roof replacement to cost between $27,000 and $30,000.</p>
<br/>
We've set our fundraising goal at $40,000. We'll open with a tarp on our roof if we have to. But we're hoping to raise $70,000 right off the bat. <ul> </ul> </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Because London is our home, we want to help revitalize downtown London and make it a destination for kids, teens, adults and seniors. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Plan</h3> <p>
We would love to run this movie theater. We think
this would be a great family business and a real asset to downtown London and
the greater London community as a whole. </p>
<p>We want to attract new business and
bring life back to our main street – <i>so
people want to be here.</i></p>
<p>
There’s a serious
lack of venues where folks can go on dates or  to
meet with friends in this town. Bringing a destination back to downtown London will go a long way to revitalizing the city.</p>
<p>Our plan is to upgrade the concession offerings to include gourmet meal  and snack options, beer, wine, and also the traditional premium movie fare of popcorn and candy.</p>
<p>We're also looking to start a semiannual local filmmaker's festival: Where Madison County residents' YouTube videos are showcased on the big screen, and the best are rewarded prizes and bragging rights.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Not only will your financial contribution be the first step in helping downtown London become a vibrant and attractive destination again, you also can get some cool perks and swag as a thank you.</p>

We are raising $70,000 to re-open The State Theater in London.
It’s just a portion of the budget we need to get the place up and running
again but It’ll go a long way into helping us install a digital projector with
crystal-clear picture, and a roof that won't leak.
 
Your contribution, no matter the size, tells us
that we’re not alone in believing that downtown London needs to bring fun back!
With your help, the State can be THE place to see first-run blockbuster movies, go on dates, visit with friends, and take the family.  What We Need • Priority one: a projectorMovies come as computer files now, and are played on digital projectors. The files are a proprietary format that protects the movie industry from piracy. Only three projector manufacturers (Christie, Sony, and NEC) make projectors capable of showing movies in the format sent for first-run movies.
We're looking to buy an NEC digital projector; a new, brighter, shinier screen - and having these professionally installed. The price to do so should cost about $40,000 to $43,000.
• Priority two: a new roof
We'd like people to be able to watch movies without needing an umbrella.
The roof has been patched so many times, that estimates for a temporary roof fix are nearly as much as the estimates for replacing the entire roof. 
We project the roof replacement to cost between $27,000 and $30,000.

We've set our fundraising goal at $40,000. We'll open with a tarp on our roof if we have to. But we're hoping to raise $70,000 right off the bat.   


Who We Are
We're the Treynor family. We already live and work in the heart of London. Rob worked for years with The Madison Press and still contributes regularly. Shannon has a law office on North Main, just a few doors from the courthouse.
We have two kids at London Middle School and one at London High School. Between them, they represent London in track, golf, baseball and band. Our two sons are Boy Scouts in London's troop 102. Our daughter is a regular altar server at London's Saint Patrick Church. 



Because London is our home, we want to help revitalize downtown London and make it a destination for kids, teens, adults and seniors. 

  The Plan 
We would love to run this movie theater. We think
this would be a great family business and a real asset to downtown London and
the greater London community as a whole. 
We want to attract new business and
bring life back to our main street – so
people want to be here.

There’s a serious
lack of venues where folks can go on dates or  to
meet with friends in this town. Bringing a destination back to downtown London will go a long way to revitalizing the city.
Our plan is to upgrade the concession offerings to include gourmet meal  and snack options, beer, wine, and also the traditional premium movie fare of popcorn and candy.
We're also looking to start a semiannual local filmmaker's festival: Where Madison County residents' YouTube videos are showcased on the big screen, and the best are rewarded prizes and bragging rights.


What You Get
Not only will your financial contribution be the first step in helping downtown London become a vibrant and attractive destination again, you also can get some cool perks and swag as a thank you.



    Other Ways You Can Help
What makes London so special of a community is the willingness for people to invest in their city. 
That's why we're confident that you'll understand that having a working movie theater in downtown London is an investment in our town's future. Having a destination downtown is a magnet that will attract other businesses and retail establishments.  
But we understand not everyone can invest with their pocketbook. But maybe you know someone who can. It costs you nothing to spread the news that the State Theater wants to re-open. Share this indiegogo campaign on your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter page (use hashtag #BringBackTheState) Harass your wealthy uncle into contributing.  Ride your bike down the street at 6 a.m. while shouting our URL.
Together, we can make this happen!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Acrobatic Conundrum, a new circus company from Seattle, Washington, was </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">one of 3 companies chosen to headline</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> at the 1st edition of the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival. Please join our community and support us bringing our show to Chicago! </span><br/></p>
<p><b>The Company</b></p>
<p>We founded the Acrobatic Conundrum with the goal of bringing groups of artists together, and expressing our creative voice via the immediacy of circus arts. We aim to connect with our audiences and perform our own truth on stage. Since we began in November of 2012, we have produced 3 completely different shows with a variety of performance artists. In less than a year our fledgling company has been honored to have appearances at fundraisers, festivals and on local television.</p>
<p>We will be taking our latest show to Chicago: The Way Out. In 90-minutes of heart-stopping acrobatics, aerial, theater and dance, the 8 performers tell a story of trying to escape from the ultimate dead end. Everyone inevitably gets lost somewhere along the way: in an unfulfilling job, a lonely apartment, or reduced to a statistic. The situation becomes literal when eight strangers find themselves in a room with no exit. Isolated from the world in a bunker where supplies are scarce. Unable to avoid each other, they discover themselves: vindictive and kind, desperate and hopeful. </p>
<p>This show uses contemporary forms of storytelling, combining the raw physicality of the performers, with video projection, and a powerful musical score. It features the choreography of Elizabeth Rose and artistic direction of Terry Crane.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The Festival</b></p>
<p>The Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival is the <b>first</b> of its kind here in the United States. They have created this event with the intention of developing a new and educated audience for circus in the US; they want to blow the doors off the idea that the circus is a big-top, big-budget extravaganza.  We are so excited to be a featured headliner at this festival, as we share the common goal of wanting to change how audiences see circus. Attending this festival is an opportunity for the Acrobatic Conundrum not only to get exposure on a national and international level, but also to make connections with other performers and collaborators in our field. </p>
<p><b>Community Support</b></p>
<p>We can't grow our company without your help. In Chicago, we will be performing for bigger crowds than we ever have before at the historic Athenaeum Theatre with 900 seats (gulp) and 40’ ceilings (whee!). To prepare for the national stage, we will be reworking the show with an artist residency at Open Space for Arts and Community on Vashon Island. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Although the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival will be generously paying us a stipend, it won't be enough to cover all the costs of bringing our growing troupe of performers across the country. Our expenses include airfare, insurance and shipping of our set and specialized equipment.  Our performers are all taking “vacation” time from their other jobs to rehearse and travel to Chicago.  We would like to pay them a reasonable stipend for their time and energy, rather than make them pay to share the art we have created together. We cannot do this without the support of our community.  Any donation amount is very much appreciated. Thank you!</span></p>

<p>A local and international circus artist, Tanya has been an integral and innovative part over the last eight years within the Seattle aerial scene, and frequently collaborates with other performance groups in town including SuperGeek League, The Aerialistas, and Animate Objects Physical Theater. She is currently a member of Terry Crane’s The Acrobatic Conundrum troupe, which is creating new modern circus work in Seattle and beyond. When she is not hanging from the rafters, she appears with her partner Orville Zharoff performing their sensual acrobatic routine on stages around the Pacific Northwest. Circus has taken her around the globe; her most recent jaunt to Ireland with Fidget Feet Aerial Dance Theater where she was performing in castles, art festivals, and flying 100’ off the ground suspended from a crane. She has worked with Club Med resorts as a Circus Program Advisor and Guest Performer, where she has made appearances in locales such as Turks/Caicos islands and Ixtapa, Mexico. She spent her youth in the ballet studio, training at the top schools in the U.S. (San Francisco Ballet School, School of American Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet School). Her training can be seen in her aesthetic for classical lines and solid technique; when blended with a formidable strength to flexibility ratio and explosive onstage drama she is a force to be reckoned with.

<p></p></div>","The Acrobatic Conundrum, a new circus company from Seattle, Washington, was one of 3 companies chosen to headline at the 1st edition of the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival. Please join our community and support us bringing our show to Chicago! 
The Company
We founded the Acrobatic Conundrum with the goal of bringing groups of artists together, and expressing our creative voice via the immediacy of circus arts. We aim to connect with our audiences and perform our own truth on stage. Since we began in November of 2012, we have produced 3 completely different shows with a variety of performance artists. In less than a year our fledgling company has been honored to have appearances at fundraisers, festivals and on local television.
We will be taking our latest show to Chicago: The Way Out. In 90-minutes of heart-stopping acrobatics, aerial, theater and dance, the 8 performers tell a story of trying to escape from the ultimate dead end. Everyone inevitably gets lost somewhere along the way: in an unfulfilling job, a lonely apartment, or reduced to a statistic. The situation becomes literal when eight strangers find themselves in a room with no exit. Isolated from the world in a bunker where supplies are scarce. Unable to avoid each other, they discover themselves: vindictive and kind, desperate and hopeful. 
This show uses contemporary forms of storytelling, combining the raw physicality of the performers, with video projection, and a powerful musical score. It features the choreography of Elizabeth Rose and artistic direction of Terry Crane.  


The Festival
The Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival is the first of its kind here in the United States. They have created this event with the intention of developing a new and educated audience for circus in the US; they want to blow the doors off the idea that the circus is a big-top, big-budget extravaganza.  We are so excited to be a featured headliner at this festival, as we share the common goal of wanting to change how audiences see circus. Attending this festival is an opportunity for the Acrobatic Conundrum not only to get exposure on a national and international level, but also to make connections with other performers and collaborators in our field. 
Community Support
We can't grow our company without your help. In Chicago, we will be performing for bigger crowds than we ever have before at the historic Athenaeum Theatre with 900 seats (gulp) and 40’ ceilings (whee!). To prepare for the national stage, we will be reworking the show with an artist residency at Open Space for Arts and Community on Vashon Island. 
Although the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival will be generously paying us a stipend, it won't be enough to cover all the costs of bringing our growing troupe of performers across the country. Our expenses include airfare, insurance and shipping of our set and specialized equipment.  Our performers are all taking “vacation” time from their other jobs to rehearse and travel to Chicago.  We would like to pay them a reasonable stipend for their time and energy, rather than make them pay to share the art we have created together. We cannot do this without the support of our community.  Any donation amount is very much appreciated. Thank you!
The Acrobatic Conundrum is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the purposes of The Acrobatic Conundrum must be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.


You can also give reward-free donations directly through our website: www.acrobaticconundrum.com  
We understand that times can be tight.  If you cannot donate financially, we appreciate you spreading the word about our work to people you think might appreciate what we are doing.  You can find us at www.acrobaticconundrum.com and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/acrobatic.conundrum
Thank you so much for your generous support.

The Acrobatic Conundrum
Visit With Our Artistic Director on a Trip in France
Check out Terry Crane's exploits ""being inspired"" by French contemporary circus. France boasts the worlds' most extensive network of venues, companies, places of residency, and educational institutions associated with circus. There is a thriving circus arts scene, constantly evolving and challenging bounds of all kinds. We would like to aspire to help create an arts community of this scope in the U.S., providing ongoing opportunities for performers, relevant art for the world, and transcendent performances for audiences.


Behind the scenes with Terry Crane
Starting a new circus scene in the U.S. presents significant challenges, such as educating conversant audiences, collaborating with other organizations, and finding sources of funding. Terry talks about the inspiration for the ""stealing French circus video"", and some of these challenges. Please support our mission of growing a sustainable contemporary circus company in Seattle.

Meet Jonathan and Emma, Aerialists and ClownsCheck out these interviews with Jonathan Rose and Emma Curtiss. They have been performing with the Conundrum since Vol. 1 in October, 2012. Here they talk about why they perform and their aspirations for what comes next. 

Meet our Directors!
Joselynn Tokashiki Engstrom - Managing Director, Trapeze Artist




Joselynn, a scientist by study, ran away and joined an international traveling circus when she was 29.  At 31 years old, she moved back to her hometown of Seattle, and immediately immersed herself in the circus community to study the trapeze.  She began training at the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts, where she met her artistic partner, Terry Crane.  At age 35 she left her coaching position to pursue the creative dream of The Acrobatic Conundrum.  Joselynn has performed with many groups including Dream Science Circus, Circus Contraption, Orkestar Zirkonium and Cafe Nordo.


Terry Crane - Artistic Director

A fascination with circus art has brought Terry to all corners of the globe, notably the Beijing International Arts School, the National Circus School of Montreal, the School of Acrobatics & New Circus Arts, and Oberlin College. Although inspired by lineages of various performance and movement disciplines ranging from capoeira to neo-buffoonery, all of Terry's work remains his fiercely unique, original style. Since finishing higher education--so to speak--Terry has performed his antics in 10 countries on 3 continents, met a king and a prime minister, starred on TV shows, and received accolades from aficionados, peers, and critics. Performance credits include: Honolulu Punch, Talvisirkus Hurjaruuth, and Circuses Starlight, Monti, and Flora. An advocate of collaboration of all kinds, he has founded two performance companies: Circus Syzygy, and the Acrobatic Conundrum. Terry continues to revel in sharing the sublime experience of performance with audiences around the world. 
Meet our Artists!


Tanya Brno - Rope and Straps Aerialist



A local and international circus artist, Tanya has been an integral and innovative part over the last eight years within the Seattle aerial scene, and frequently collaborates with other performance groups in town including SuperGeek League, The Aerialistas, and Animate Objects Physical Theater. She is currently a member of Terry Crane’s The Acrobatic Conundrum troupe, which is creating new modern circus work in Seattle and beyond. When she is not hanging from the rafters, she appears with her partner Orville Zharoff performing their sensual acrobatic routine on stages around the Pacific Northwest. Circus has taken her around the globe; her most recent jaunt to Ireland with Fidget Feet Aerial Dance Theater where she was performing in castles, art festivals, and flying 100’ off the ground suspended from a crane. She has worked with Club Med resorts as a Circus Program Advisor and Guest Performer, where she has made appearances in locales such as Turks/Caicos islands and Ixtapa, Mexico. She spent her youth in the ballet studio, training at the top schools in the U.S. (San Francisco Ballet School, School of American Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet School). Her training can be seen in her aesthetic for classical lines and solid technique; when blended with a formidable strength to flexibility ratio and explosive onstage drama she is a force to be reckoned with.

Marta Brown - Partner Acrobatics, Cyr Wheel





Marta Brown gets thrown through the air and usually gets caught before she hits the ground. Last summer she performed with Circus Bella in San Francisco with the Russian Bar Hoppers and this year she is looking forward to performing with the Acrobatic Conundrum. She can be bribed with Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Karmel Sutra and Half Baked are her favorites. (Photo credit: Karen Garret de Luna)
Arne Bystrom - Juggler, Acrobat



Arne is a juggler, acrobat, and natural born performer based in the Pacific Northwest. A graduate of l'Ecole de Cirque in Quebec, Arne has performed in productions in Quebec City, Chile, and toured New England with Circus Smirkus. He currently performs with two Seattle-based circus companies, the Acrobatic Conundrum and the IMPulse Circus Collective. Arne coaches at the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts and enjoys playing with radios. He is very excited to join with the Conundrum crew in bringing the Bunker (and maybe a Way Out?) to Chicago for this historic festival!


Emma Curtiss - Silks Aerialist, Clown




Emma Curtiss has been doing circus for the past four years. She loves art in many mediums and has been a glassblower as well as a performer. She loves yoga and toast, and believes that people move mountains, but great art is what moves people. She doesn't have a cell phone so it's hard to get ahold of her. Recently her rate of response in an email has improved dramatically, but due to some recent exciting events she has forgotten her due dilligence. She's not single (sorry guys ;-)) which is weird but awesome for her, mainly because now she has someone who can help carry her bags. There are A LOT of bags. She loves games, any kind, (except the kind where she might not understand or lose) and is pretty much easily excited by almost anything. She also feels writing her own bio is kind of awkward.
Tyler Ferraro - Acrobat, Partner Acrobatics, Cyr Wheel
Tyler Ferraro is a Pacific Northwest native hailing from the land of Wine and Onions also known as Walla Walla. Working as a software engineer at Amazon by day and is an acrobat with the troupe by night he has been called the Clark Kent of the computer world by ""his grandma."" Getting his start with a troupe in Southern Oregon over 7 years ago, Tyler is a self trained acrobat, tumbler and performer of a newer art form called martial arts tricking. He has performed with the Dead Man's Carnival Vaudeville troupe in Wisconsin and various places throughout Italy and China.

I'd like to actually put on a festival show with enough funds to get a really top-notch venue for a couple of weeks, and to put some proper marketing behind it - in previous shows, a few posters has been all I've been able to afford, and mainly I've relied on social media and word of mouth. </p>
<p>As I said, I've done OK, but I want this next one to be bigger and better and for the word to spread far and wide. My MICF show for next year, if this goes to plan, will be Trigger Warning, a show about things that people tell me I shouldn't joke about. My hope is that it will be deeply offensive, and even more deeply funny. My comedic progression, which in the last couple of years has encompassed improvisation with Let's Put On A Show, and will go into more personal territory with my upcoming Fringe show Wearing A Towel, will hence move into the ""possibly pissing people off"" area, which should be fun.</p>
<p>And basically, I want as many people as possible to see it, and talk about it, and spread the word. I also want to put the show on with only as much worry and stress and stomach ulcers as are strictly necessary - to achieve both these goals I'm asking for a tiny bit of your help, because my own funds are severely limited and mainly spent on feeding and clothing my children, which is of course less important than comedy, but more punishable by imprisonment if I don't do it.</p>
<p>All I'm asking for is ONE DOLLAR from you. Seriously - that's it. ONE DOLLAR. As you see my goal is $13,111. I chose that figure because as of the 21st July, 2013, that's how many Twitter followers I have. If I get just one dollar from each of them, I have my goal.</p>
<p>Now of course some of my followers are spambots, so they won't give me a dollar. But hopefully a few people who aren't on Twitter will kick in, and MAYBE I can even get more than a dollar from a few of you who can afford it and who really want this show to happen. If you do give more than one dollar, there are lots of sweet rewards on offer as you see. If you only give one though, you'll still be recognised on the Trigger Warning Honour Roll.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can reach this target, or even beyond it. If not, hopefully I'll still have enough to get Trigger Warning up and happening. The funds I raise will be spent on registration, venue hire, marketing and advertising, and other expenses like props, costumes, travel, etc, the sundries that go into a festival show, and basically making life a little easier for me as I try to pay the bills and mount a really professional show at the same time. Anything left over will be put toward my touring fund, and hopefully contribute to my being able to take one of my shows on the road and show off to other cities around Australia. So that's right - your donation could assist me in getting to YOUR town. Exciting right?</p>
<p>ONE DOLLAR. Twitter hashtag is #GiveBenaDollar. It's a very small amount, and it's all I ask. If everyone does it, this Trigger Warning is well on its way to reaching everyone it should reach, and naturally quite a few it shouldn't. Come on guys, let's shake this comedy world up a little, huh?</p></span></div>","2011: Ben Pobjie performs his debut Melbourne International Comedy Festival show, Ben Pobjie's Funeral.

<p><strong>My Story</strong> </p>
<p>I have been a family member of La MaMa – the world renowned experimental theatre club in downtown Manhattan since 1979. During the AIDS crisis in the early eighties a large number of my friends passed away. In 1985 my partner, Steve Lott, was diagnosed with the disease and suffered a slow and agonizing death in 1991.<em> R</em><span lang=""en-US""><em>avaged by Romance</em>, a multi-media musical which I produced in 2003, was based on poems by Steve Lott about how it feels to be dying. Some of these poems appear in this current play, <em>The Etiquette of Death</em>, composed to music by Tony Stavick. </span></p>
<p>Last year I lost my set designer Garry Hayes to AIDS. During that time, I started thinking a lot about the etiquette of death, the death of Ellen Stewart, our East Coast mother, and the fact that we're all going to die. How do you prepare for your mother's death? My idea is that when you add the artifice of etiquette and beauty to this unavoidable journey, comedy will ensue. What is the ""etiquette of death""?</p>
<p>As a painter and collage artist, I use everything from precious objects to household trash to create a single assemblage. I have done the same thing to make <em>The</em> <em>Etiquette of Death</em>, creating a collage from death's ugliness, beauty, comedy and horror, utilizing the work of the greatest writers and artists I know. We are creating one cohesive theatrical piece by putting together scenes, songs and poetry driven by music and dance that explore the ""etiquette of death"" and how one perceives it. I want my audience to look at the way we behave when people are dying. Let's not be scared but laugh about it!</p>
<p>As a visual artist, I have had over 20 solo shows here in New York and abroad. For the last 12 years I have been showing at Pavel Zoubok Gallery in New York. Before that I showed for 10 years with Bridgewater Fine Arts. Other recent solo shows include Carl Solway Gallery in Cincinnati and Atrium Gallery St. Louis. During the 90s I have had four shows with Jean-Luc Richard at Gallery OZ in Paris.</p>
<p><span lang=""en-US"">I am also a theatre artist and have been working at La MaMa since 1979 collaborating with John Vaccaro, Sebastian Stuart, Everett Quinton, Lance Cruce, Julie Atlas Muz and The New Stage Theatre Company. I have also worked with the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Penny Arcade, Mabou Mines, Maria Irene Fornes, Cyndi Lauper, The Wooster Group and David Lynch. During the last 10 years I have been performing with Karen Finley's <em>Make Love</em>, a cabaret show in memorial of the 9/11 attacks, all over the country.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><span lang=""en-US"">People in the gay community are still dying from AIDS. Those that did not die during the peak of the crisis are growing older and now their parents are dying. We were so busy taking care of people infected with the disease that we did not plan for our futures. <em>The Etiquette of Death</em> aims to deal with these matters in a comedic way. By proposing to live life to the fullest, it shows us that we do not need to be afraid of death. It suggests to come to terms with our mortality through comedy in order to explore the beauty of death. The protagonist of our show is going through the 5 stages of death. She tries to bargain with Death and give Death a makeover. But she realizes that this is impossible as she is afraid of Death, finds it ugly and repulsing. It is not until she is aware of all her accomplishments in life that she can finally give Death a makeover, make it beautiful, accept it, be less scared and leave this world. </span></p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>In order to produce this show we need money for costumes, sets, cards, publicity etc. We also need to pay the band and actors and cover running expenses for the theatre. If we raise all the money we need, we’ll have a six-piece band, which will allow for the audience to live and breath with us, great sets and wonderful costumes made out of silk and chiffon.  </p>

It's a playful tragedy about a generation of revolutionaries who prefer to rebel via social media than actually do something. In this era where so many of us are guilty of expressing political opinions with the click of a mouse and little more, it's a relevant and intriguing look at the world today, where politicians twist the truth and stories and images are created for our consumption online. </p><p>With original live music, created especially for the show and performed by the actors. </p><p>Three performers directly address the audience and slip in and out of different characters. The style of the show moves from open storytelling form to serious drama and engages the audience with it’s fast paced stylised dialogue and resonating political issues. </p><p>We use the story of Antigone to innovatively and sincerely face our internet-saturated culture, and asks questions about how it might affect our thoughts and actions on social change. </p><p><br/></p><h3>The Team</h3><p>Vivien Von Abendorff: Concept, Text, Performer <br/></p><p>Kalki Aporos: Concept, Text, Director </p><p>Claire Naylor: Performer </p><p>Iskandar Sharazudin: Performer </p><p>Edwina Strobl: Assistant Director </p><p>Mariana Geisinger: Producer </p><p>Ginny Kim: Producer </p><p><br/></p><h3>Performance History</h3><div>

I AM NOT ANTIGONE
I AM NOT ANTIGONE was first created by four RADA MA T&P graduates, as a co-production with the National Theatre ‘Sterija’ in Vrsac, Serbia. Since, it has toured Serbia and performed at the Fringe Festivals of Amsterdam, Brighton and Prague, where we were funded by the Amsterdam Art Fund, the European Cultural Foundation and the Netherlands Embassy. We are currently re-working the show further into a full length 90 minute piece and are our performance at the RADA Festival would be our London debut. dlgkjlkjUpcoming Performance  
22-23 June, RADA Festival, London, UK

WHAT TO EXPECTI AM NOT ANTIGONE is a multimedia show which brings the 2,500 year-old classic bang up to date, with three performers, an iPhone, a projector, a MacBook and Twitter. It's a playful tragedy about a generation of revolutionaries who prefer to rebel via social media than actually do something. In this era where so many of us are guilty of expressing political opinions with the click of a mouse and little more, it's a relevant and intriguing look at the world today, where politicians twist the truth and stories and images are created for our consumption online. With original live music, created especially for the show and performed by the actors. Three performers directly address the audience and slip in and out of different characters. The style of the show moves from open storytelling form to serious drama and engages the audience with it’s fast paced stylised dialogue and resonating political issues. We use the story of Antigone to innovatively and sincerely face our internet-saturated culture, and asks questions about how it might affect our thoughts and actions on social change. The TeamVivien Von Abendorff: Concept, Text, Performer Kalki Aporos: Concept, Text, Director Claire Naylor: Performer Iskandar Sharazudin: Performer Edwina Strobl: Assistant Director Mariana Geisinger: Producer Ginny Kim: Producer Performance History

Μέσα από τραγούδια, ποιήματα και εικόνες προσεγγίζουμε την καθημερινότητα με έναν ποιητικό τρόπο, άλλοτε για να φωτιστεί από διαφορετική γωνία ένα γεγονός κι άλλοτε για να γίνει αυτός ο ποιητικός τρόπος μία γέφυρα να ειπωθεί το ανείπωτο.

<h3>The fan man<br/>
or how to dress an elephant</h3>
<h4>Help us to make the performance.<br/>
Help us to make an untold story to be told.<br/>
</h4>
</blockquote><br/><h4>The topic of the performance</h4>The topic of this performance “ the fan man or how to dress an elephant” is human difference: Either how each individual perceives himself as different or how society influences and is influenced by or reacts to something considered different. <br/><br/><h4>On stage</h4><p>On stage we will witness a series of everyday events seen from a poetic perspective. This perspective will  both shed light on an event that can be seen from a different angle and will bridge the audience with what so far can not be said or can not be expressed. 
These brief acts  are characterised by the need to express the real, the specific, the subjective, the situations that the heroes experience. <br/></p><h4>The process of the performance<br/>
</h4><p>The process of the performance does not depend on a pre-existent dramaturgy. 
On the contrary the final text will come from the creative participation of the members of the group through written and oral work as well as improvisations. Each member participates actively to the performance with his/her own personal contribution. Moreover exploring the abilities and the expressive means of every member, we aim to show that performable-something that can be staged- is not only the common, but also the different and the uncommon. 

The integration of mentally challenged people:
Group membership and cooperative work lead to these peoples' development both on a social and individual level as they have to take initiatives. Because the rehearsals  
have equal demands from every participant, they become more active as they feel they won't be judged as individuals but as a team. Their enthusiasm about sharing the responsibility for what is to be performed, is gradually becoming discipline and consistency, as to reach the final goal is not easy and requires hard work. Also the fact that they' re asked to express their opinion on the work they have to do, helps them share thoughts, fears and dreams and therefore it makes them more communicative.
</p><h4>
En Dynamei ""Diverse Potential""</h4>En Dynamei (‘Diverse Potential') is an organization based in Thessaloniki, Greece, which
includes young people with intellectual disabilities, volunteers, parents and friends.
<br/><br/>Founded in 2008, the group was born from the overwhelming need to share and express
personal stories through the prism of artistic expression. En Dynamei exists to facilitate
exploration into the undiscovered sources of creativity as well as integration of its
members into the wider social environment. The group organizes, develops and
promotes a variety of educational, social, artistic and cultural activities, collaborating with
major organizations in Thessaloniki. The members coexist within a community focusing
on establishing a symbiosis of interpersonal relationships and identifying and developing
the individual skills and interests of each person.
The ultimate goal of En
Dynamei is to challenge the
conventional interpretation of
what is ‘different’ or
‘unfamiliar’ in the arts and to
embrace diversity in the
modern era. <br/><br/>Drawing together
people from mixed
backgrounds, En Dynamei
utilizes the artistic process
(theatre, film, music, visual
arts) to create a common
ground for experimental
creation and communication
through its fluid and daring language. The artistic medium becomes the meeting point
that breaks down the prejudices and barriers between audience and that which is
‘different.<br/><br/>En Dynamei is working towards ‘a place’ where:
<br/>• living an everyday life amongst passionate and devoted people is a daily source
of inspiration and an encouragement towards excellence
<br/>• holistic expression and creative integration using art is an answer to the question
‘Who am I really?’
<br/>• art becomes the common ground to meet with original ideas, thoughts and
feelings, through color, touch, words, shapes, sound, rhythm, movement
and….life.<br/><b><br/>Contact</b>:

The fan man
or how to dress an elephant
Help us to make the performance.
Help us to make an untold story to be told.

The topic of the performanceThe topic of this performance “ the fan man or how to dress an elephant” is human difference: Either how each individual perceives himself as different or how society influences and is influenced by or reacts to something considered different. On stageOn stage we will witness a series of everyday events seen from a poetic perspective. This perspective will  both shed light on an event that can be seen from a different angle and will bridge the audience with what so far can not be said or can not be expressed. 
These brief acts  are characterised by the need to express the real, the specific, the subjective, the situations that the heroes experience. The process of the performance
The process of the performance does not depend on a pre-existent dramaturgy. 
On the contrary the final text will come from the creative participation of the members of the group through written and oral work as well as improvisations. Each member participates actively to the performance with his/her own personal contribution. Moreover exploring the abilities and the expressive means of every member, we aim to show that performable-something that can be staged- is not only the common, but also the different and the uncommon. 

The integration of mentally challenged people:
Group membership and cooperative work lead to these peoples' development both on a social and individual level as they have to take initiatives. Because the rehearsals  
have equal demands from every participant, they become more active as they feel they won't be judged as individuals but as a team. Their enthusiasm about sharing the responsibility for what is to be performed, is gradually becoming discipline and consistency, as to reach the final goal is not easy and requires hard work. Also the fact that they' re asked to express their opinion on the work they have to do, helps them share thoughts, fears and dreams and therefore it makes them more communicative.

En Dynamei ""Diverse Potential""En Dynamei (‘Diverse Potential') is an organization based in Thessaloniki, Greece, which
includes young people with intellectual disabilities, volunteers, parents and friends.
Founded in 2008, the group was born from the overwhelming need to share and express
personal stories through the prism of artistic expression. En Dynamei exists to facilitate
exploration into the undiscovered sources of creativity as well as integration of its
members into the wider social environment. The group organizes, develops and
promotes a variety of educational, social, artistic and cultural activities, collaborating with
major organizations in Thessaloniki. The members coexist within a community focusing
on establishing a symbiosis of interpersonal relationships and identifying and developing
the individual skills and interests of each person.
The ultimate goal of En
Dynamei is to challenge the
conventional interpretation of
what is ‘different’ or
‘unfamiliar’ in the arts and to
embrace diversity in the
modern era. Drawing together
people from mixed
backgrounds, En Dynamei
utilizes the artistic process
(theatre, film, music, visual
arts) to create a common
ground for experimental
creation and communication
through its fluid and daring language. The artistic medium becomes the meeting point
that breaks down the prejudices and barriers between audience and that which is
‘different.En Dynamei is working towards ‘a place’ where:
• living an everyday life amongst passionate and devoted people is a daily source
of inspiration and an encouragement towards excellence
• holistic expression and creative integration using art is an answer to the question
‘Who am I really?’
• art becomes the common ground to meet with original ideas, thoughts and
feelings, through color, touch, words, shapes, sound, rhythm, movement
and….life.Contact:

sheet of paper into this typewriter (or more likely firing up the blank screen 
on his computer), or a painter confronting a virginal canvas, a sculptor staring 
at a raw chunk of stone, a composer at the piano with his fingers hovering just 
above the keys.  Some people find this moment - the moment before creativity

2013 season began last July with Artistic Director Vit Horejs teaching
directors from all over the world to play with puppets at La MaMa Umbria in the gorgeous Italian
countryside. This summer the company also performed in Montauk, Southampton
and in libraries and parks in New
  York City's five boroughs.  </p>
<p>And, only weeks after the U.S. government ground to halt, we
look forward to sharing with you the twenty-four-hundred-year old constitution
critique that is the basis for our new play, THE REPUBLIC, or, MY DINNER WITH
SOCRATES.  Is democracy not the ideal
form of government?  Was Socrates
executed by a vigilant Athenian ""department of homeland
security?""  The play may not answer
these questions, but we hope to open a dialogue in a true Socratic method.  </p>
<p><b>THE REPUBLIC </b>will premiere on November 29 presented in La MaMa's Fall 2013 Season, and run for three weeks. We want you to be part of the action as an

2013 season began last July with Artistic Director Vit Horejs teaching
directors from all over the world to play with puppets at La MaMa Umbria in the gorgeous Italian
countryside. This summer the company also performed in Montauk, Southampton
and in libraries and parks in New
  York City's five boroughs.  
And, only weeks after the U.S. government ground to halt, we
look forward to sharing with you the twenty-four-hundred-year old constitution
critique that is the basis for our new play, THE REPUBLIC, or, MY DINNER WITH
SOCRATES.  Is democracy not the ideal
form of government?  Was Socrates
executed by a vigilant Athenian ""department of homeland
security?""  The play may not answer
these questions, but we hope to open a dialogue in a true Socratic method.  
THE REPUBLIC will premiere on November 29 presented in La MaMa's Fall 2013 Season, and run for three weeks. We want you to be part of the action as an
audience member and supporter, and in post performance discussions.  
We have a cast of 6 actors, 50 marionettes and dozens of shadow puppets.  The live music is by Clifton Hyde, set design
by Tom Lee, marionettes
by Jakub “Kuba” Krejci and
Milos Kasal, and shadow puppets and
costumes by Theresa Linnihan.
Cast members are Deborah Beshaw-Farrell, Christopher Broholm, Vit Horejs,  Theresa Linnihan, Jonathan Mastrojohn, and Alan Netherton.
Rehearsals began in September and we need your help to bring
the play to the stage. Help us raise $2,644 toward the total budget of
$34,500.

<p>Bobby Hot Stuff is an improv comedy group from Los Angeles comprised of players with training backgrounds from iO West (formerly
named Improv Olympic West) and Upright Citizens Brigade Los Angeles.
We specialize in performing a variety of forms in repertory.<br/><br/></p>
<p>For the last four years, Bobby Hot Stuff has produced, booked, and
hosted a night of improv comedy in Hollywood every Friday night in
The Loft at iO West. BHS founded and hosts the Annual Slacker
Festival in the fall at iO West, and they have been featured
selections for the last three years at the L.A. Improv Comedy
Festival.<br/><br/>This year, for the first time, we have been invited
to perform at the San Francisco Improv Festival on Thursday, August
25th. BHS will perform a modified Slacker (an form of long form
improv) they created called a Memento Slacker (loosely inspired by
the film MEMENTO).</p>
<p>Cast: Aaron Bendele, Jonathan Flanagan, Bernard Hyland, Echo

<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of you reading this are improvisers, so you know that we
don't get paid for doing our shows. For the rest of you ""civilians"",
in addition to not getting paid (we do it for the thrill of
performing in front of a live audience), there are expenses that come
with being an improv group. Each of us pay our coach and room rental
fees (approx. $50/month per person), as well as the cost of promoting
our weekly show (printing show posters monthly, approx. $30/month
total). In other words, without your generous donations we will have
to pay for the entire trip out of pocket, possibly cutting the length
of our stay in San Francisco short.</p>

Carlton. We selected it for it's proximity to the performance venue,
it's in a safe neighborhood and they offered a great deal to SFIF
Performers.</p>
<br/><p>That brings the trip cost to $517.80. We rounded up to $550 to
cover the fees for the campaign (Indiegogo and credit card

go to us regardless of whether or not we hit our goal. However, if we

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is a play I have been working on for two years, and finally we are able to produce it in June.</p>
<p>We are a collective of artists interested in looking at important and relevant social issues through the arts. Theatre from its inception has been political, pointing out injustices to those in power. This play is important to all of us because of what is says about gender; highlighting and questioning the disparities between men and women. Especially those that we participate in, and those that we simply allow to happen to us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need help with all sorts of costs. Funds will go toward:</p>

This is a play I have been working on for two years, and finally we are able to produce it in June.
We are a collective of artists interested in looking at important and relevant social issues through the arts. Theatre from its inception has been political, pointing out injustices to those in power. This play is important to all of us because of what is says about gender; highlighting and questioning the disparities between men and women. Especially those that we participate in, and those that we simply allow to happen to us.
 


What We Need & What You Get
We need help with all sorts of costs. Funds will go toward:
Costumes - (There are a few period costumes in this piece, and so the cost of those may be significant)
Festival costs- (fees associated with publicity)
Rehearsal space - (renting rehearsal space in NYC can get pricey!!)
And most importantly, travel costs for the actors and crew - (cast and crew will be coming in for rehearsals and performances from the  boroughs, Long Island, and New Jersey. Being able to offset those costs for them would be amazing!)

<p>Local residents and theatre buffs alike are organizing in an effort to reestablish The American Shakespeare Festival Theatre  to its former glory.  That's where we come in. Our grass roots theatre company<em> Arch Villain</em> is set to catapult interest by producing the first play on the American Shakespeare Festival stage in 29 years: <strong><em>a</em></strong> <em><strong>steampunk version of Richard III. </strong></em></p>
<p>Together with your help, we will be able to breathe new life into this historical landmark, and bring theatre, culture and tourism back to Stratford, CT.   </p>
<h3><strong><em>What is The American Shakespeare Festival Theatre?</em></strong></h3>
<p>The historical American Shakespeare Festival Theatre of Stratford CT was first founded in the 1950's by Lawrence Langner, Lincoln Kristein and Joseph Verner Reed.  Mr. Langner was also a founding member of the New York City Theatre Guild and Westport Country Playhouse.</p>
<p>Between 1955 and the 1980's The American Shakespeare Festival theatre has nurtured such talents as Katherine Hepburn, Chrisopher Walken, Ed Asner, James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer. </p>

<h3><em><strong>Who we are:</strong></em></h3>
<p>This whole project began with three theatre artists:  Geoffrey Gilbert, Vic Terenzio and Melissa Schleier. We are all professionally trained actors who met while performing together in a local community theatre production.   Since then, we teamed up with Stratford town councilman and actor Matt Catalano, who has been advocating for the theatre for several years. </p>
<p>Together we founded<em><strong> Arch Villain Theatre Company:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>""We are on a quest to heighten emotions, envelope the senses and awaken the psyche.  By producing plays both new and old, we endeavor to propel an ancient art form into the modern age.""</em></p>
<p>We boast a highly skilled and diverse group of regional talent that includes an alumni member of the National Shakespeare Company, producers, professionally trained actors, and designers. </p>

<p>Welcome to Ebony Cabaret.. a warm trip back to the juke joint nights, sassy singers, Burlesque dancing and bands that swing! We have been appearing monthly at M Bar since launching in Sept 2012. Each month we get bigger audience, new songs,dances and memorable experiences. Our goal has always been to create an environment that nurtures the artist and leaves the audience feeling like they really are apart of a family.</p>
<p>I feel in the short time we have been on the scene we have done that. With that same intent and spirit we are participating in this year's Hollywood Fringe Festival. The Hollywood Fringe Festival is an annual celebration of the emerging arts. Environments for the Fringe include both traditional and unorthodox venues; fully equipped theatres, street corners, clubs, bars, and places unexpected. Performances are self-produced by local, national, and international arts companies and independent performers.</p>
<p>We plan to showcase ourselves at Three Clubs in Hollywood a premier spot for Burlesque and Cabaret. Since we are known for presenting our show as dinner theatre we are going to partner with a well known food truck to prepare some succulent tempting treats for all our guests.</p>
<p>In preparation for this venture we are doing a small overall of our show. Nothing is broke we just want to add a little more razzle dazzle, more dance, more variety acts, better costumes to take our show to the next level. Not to mention the festival fees, marketing,promotion and performance salaries that all need to be budgeted for. </p>
<p>As you see we need a little help from our friends. Friends like you who understand the need for wonderful live theatre. Who understand that building can be a community effort and that the results when met create magic! That is why we are here. To ask our community of friends, friends of friends, colleagues and new supporters to ""Come share the night with us"" as we like to say at Ebony Cabaret. Come share in the journey of a great concept that is evolving right before your eyes!</p>
<p>Your support will ensure that we are able to provide the best show possible. It will pay performers, it will pay our Fringe Fest fees, and moreover it will launch our marketing campaign. We want to see Ebony Cabaret in every city, entertaining the masses from small rooms like Three Clubs to the Vegas Strip baby. And our road starts this summer at the Fringe. Won't you Come Share the Night?</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and we look forward to entertaining you at a venue near YOU!</p>

<p><strong>WHO AM I?</strong></p>
<p><strong>My name is Heather Denham. I am excited to be a member of Spark! Circus this year. I am a fire performer and hoop dancer. For the past decade, I lived in San Francisco where I graduated from the master’s program in fashion design at the Academy of Art University.  After graduating, I worked seven years as a technical designer in the fashion industry.  Last year, I left my job to pursue hooping, fire performing, costume making, and circus arts full time.  I grew up in Carson City, Nevada.  At the age of three, I started acrobatics and dance lessons. I quickly fell in love with dancing, performing, acrobatics, and costumes. In the last few years, hooping has become my passion and has brought me back into performing. I appeared throughout the Bay Area as a solo act and with the hoop-dance group Mandala. I was a finalist on both seasons of Hooping Idol on Hooping.org. I am also a certified Hoop Dance Instructor from Body Hoops for both children and adults.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS SPARK CIRCUS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spark! Circus is an entirely volunteer circus that spends a month benefiting disadvantaged children on the Thai Burmese border. A group of over 20 international performers travel to refugee camps, migrant schools, hospitals and orphanages. We perform silly routines for the kids by day and circus-style fire shows at night. We also run playshops, bring donations of toys and art supplies, teach the kids how to make their own toys and generally make them laugh. The refugees live a life of insecurity and restricted freedom. There are very few opportunities to play, laugh, be creative or have any sort of childhood. Spark! reaches over 4,000 children each year.  Spark! Circus aim is to brighten days with magic, wonder, and laughter. We are all unpaid performers and Spark! relies entirely on your generous donations and community support .</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You are donating to help get me to Thailand to volunteer perform and teach with Spark circus. I will be using these funds for my airfare, food and accommodation expenses while on the project</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET AS A REWARD?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a master’s degree in fashion design and I worked for over 7 years in the fashion industry in technical design. You can get a tutu or furry leg warmers. They will both have fabric from my circus costumes incorporated in. Also, I will make a CUSTOM furry vest, furry coat, or any other costume you can imagine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF I DON’T REACH MY GOAL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>If I don’t reach my goal, all the proceeds will go to SPARK! Circus. I will still send you your reward.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW MUCH DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I need to raise $1200-$1500 for a plane ticket, $700 for living expenses, $300 for costumes, and $300 LED and fire tools.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spark! Circus is designed to develop creativity, physical fitness, communication skills, teamwork, confidence and cultural awareness. Play is a fundamental part of children’s development and a basic human right. We bring a big spark of happiness, love, amusement and entertainment into these children’s lives and the lives of those who work with them in the camps and orphanages. Through play we learn so much about ourselves. We not only learn physical coordination and skills, but also learn about the space around us. We let out our creative imagination, lightness, laughter, joy, and delight. This lasts long after the circus is in town The long term objective is to build the childrens’ confidence, cooperation, mental and manual skill levels, and creativity through play.</strong></p>

Short Summary
Hello -
Tug is a unique experience of sound, movement, design and natural occurrences chugs along the canal at 4 miles per hour on an adapted heritage work boat. Please help bringing it to Watford as part of Imagine Watford: A Festival of Extraordinary Open Air Moments. Tug will show on 26th, 29th 30th June presented by Watford Palace Theatre.
For bookings call 01923225671

Who are we?
Dog Kennel Hill Project is a dance performance collective combining the artistic voices of Ben Ash, Henrietta Hale and Rachel Lopez de la Nieta, each having a distinctive performing career in British contemporary dance.
See our website http://dogkennelhillproject.org/
find out more about Watford Palace Theatre - http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk
We are committed to exploring new contexts for dance, through a process of investigation, risk, experimentation and cross over with other art forms. Intriguing, slippery, mind-blowing and laugh-out-loud funny have been some of the ways past work is described. Asking questions about this crazy world forms the basis our work together, and we like to find a kind of beauty within the absurdity of being human.
About This Project
Highly ambitious – TUG is all about taking ourselves out of the contemporary arts bubble and placing our work in a deeply alien environment, creating opportunities for meetings, exposures and clashes with and around different ways of life. 
TUG will engage participation from canal communities and bring performance to an area rarely, if ever, the setting for contemporary performance.
Urban canals tend to conjure up ideas of disenchanted places, historically the place of the socially excluded navvies and more recently showing the decay and neglect of our abandoned industrial trade. It is in these wasteland territories, only now being reclaimed, repopulated and re-imagined with romantic notions of craft and folklore, that we will find material to weave into engaging scenarios. TUG is a meditation on waterways in which concepts and notions of fluidity, stagnation, social class, progress and degeneration all come into play.
the resulting production is a 30-40 minute performance journey with a cast of 4 multi-talented performers. It also includes a larger cast of participants who we recruit locally and work with to perform small incidental moments along the towpath, again,rooting the experience in its particular site. 
Audiences can either board the boat in exclusive groups to get an intimate immersive experience -stepping onboard means becoming an integral part of the whole spectacle as though they were our cargo that we transport....
 other larger groups follow the boat on a towpath walk with an audio guide containing an evocative sound score of voices, characters and music. Each experience plays with the merging of real, imaginary, functional and mythical situations and spectators are invited to form part the experience of their fellow audience members.
How can your contribution help?
We have been working in these environments starting on the heritage boat, Renfew based in Braunston, Northamptonshire. Here we began with the construction of a spectacular stage set designed to form an intriguing contemporary showboat. TUG had a successful first research presentation in Nottingham last year – now YOU can help support the re - development costs of taking the boat to Watford and embedding the themes of the work into the local histories and people this skippering, before we then take the work to some of UK's larger citeis such as London and Manchester, and more remote canal communities.
The plan is that during each stage of relocating the work to a new environment we will engage in local encounters where we discuss and document lives of people working the canal environment, talking about work and how they feel about things work, politics and economics related. An intriguing aspect of this is to research how our work, and more generally arts, performance and dance are perceived by the locals through these formal and informal conversations.

<h2>What is <i>Obedient Steel</i>?</h2>
<span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""></span>
<p><i>Obedient Steel</i> is a play about
the brightest minds in the world. They are young, smart, and talented. They
dance. They wear very stylish glasses. Their work is too complicated to explain
to parents or childhood friends - it is also too secret. But if you did know,
you would be very impressed. Then, something happens. A small thing, really, that could have happened to anyone, or just as easily not happened at all. And now
nothing will ever be the same.</p>
<p>This is a play about
Brilliance. This is a play about Progress. This is a play about the guinea pig
you <i>really</i> didn’t mean to hurt that is
now lying dead on the table. This is a play about You.</p>
<p></p>

<b>Tugboat Collective</b>, playwright <b>Chloe Brown</b>, and director <b>Rebecca Wear</b>. It will

<h2>What is Tugboat Collective?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Tugboat Collective is a Brooklyn-based group of
collaborative artists dedicated to developing accessible, low-cost,
experimental theater. Headed up by Artistic Directors <b>Eben Hoffer</b> and <b>Joseph Wolfslau</b>, Tugboat Collective is <b>Nathaniel Basch-Gould, Chloe Brown, Mike Faba, Isaac Hoffer, Kate Thulin,</b> and <b>Nick Trotta</b>. We are actors, writers, and designers; we make work that is surprising,
funny, and makes use of the fact that you are in the room with us.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We've been hard at work this past year. In December, we premiered </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Moon
&amp; Marble</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, a white-face clown show that </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">featured live music and a complex hemp-and-bag fly system at the Brooklyn Lyceum.  Next came </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Jack

surreal rock musical, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Violet Road, </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and produced a full album of music from the show.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>All the while, we worked on <i>Obedient Steel.</i> Since April of 2012, Tugboat has held regular workshops to develop the piece. When we began, we didn't have a script or even a story, just a lot of questions about things we'd read, heard, or seen through bullet-proof glass. After a year and a half of writing and workshops, we are so excited to share our fourth Tugboat production with you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Why We Need Your Support</h2>
<p>We're over the moon to have been selected for HERE Arts Center's SUBlet Series. However, even with this subsidized rental, the cost of the venue in addition to the other costs of putting together a full production mean that to present <i>Obedient Steel,</i> Tugboat must raise <b>$5,000</b>.</p>
<p>Where do these dollar bills go towards?</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance venue rental</li>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Material for set, costume, and props</li>
<li>Sound and lighting equipment</li>
<li>Transportation of equipment and materials</li>

Obedient Steel is a play about
the brightest minds in the world. They are young, smart, and talented. They
dance. They wear very stylish glasses. Their work is too complicated to explain
to parents or childhood friends - it is also too secret. But if you did know,
you would be very impressed. Then, something happens. A small thing, really, that could have happened to anyone, or just as easily not happened at all. And now
nothing will ever be the same.
This is a play about
Brilliance. This is a play about Progress. This is a play about the guinea pig
you really didn’t mean to hurt that is
now lying dead on the table. This is a play about You.



(graphic design by E. Noelle Bullion)
Obedient Steel has been developed since Spring 2012 with
Tugboat Collective, playwright Chloe Brown, and director Rebecca Wear. It will
premiere November 14-24 at HERE Arts Center, featuring Nathaniel Basch-Gould (Tugboat member),
E. James Ford, Craig Mungavin, Anastasia Olowin, Max Reinhardsen, and Kate
Thulin (Tugboat member).





What is Tugboat Collective?

Tugboat Collective is a Brooklyn-based group of
collaborative artists dedicated to developing accessible, low-cost,
experimental theater. Headed up by Artistic Directors Eben Hoffer and Joseph Wolfslau, Tugboat Collective is Nathaniel Basch-Gould, Chloe Brown, Mike Faba, Isaac Hoffer, Kate Thulin, and Nick Trotta. We are actors, writers, and designers; we make work that is surprising,
funny, and makes use of the fact that you are in the room with us.






(Jack the Bird and Moon & Marble)
We've been hard at work this past year. In December, we premiered Moon
& Marble, a white-face clown show that featured live music and a complex hemp-and-bag fly system at the Brooklyn Lyceum.  Next came Jack
The Bird, which appeared both in January's Snowballs Festival (Space on White) and August's Dream Up Festival at Theater for the New City. We also continued workshopping our
surreal rock musical, The Violet Road, and produced a full album of music from the show.

All the while, we worked on Obedient Steel. Since April of 2012, Tugboat has held regular workshops to develop the piece. When we began, we didn't have a script or even a story, just a lot of questions about things we'd read, heard, or seen through bullet-proof glass. After a year and a half of writing and workshops, we are so excited to share our fourth Tugboat production with you.



Why We Need Your Support
We're over the moon to have been selected for HERE Arts Center's SUBlet Series. However, even with this subsidized rental, the cost of the venue in addition to the other costs of putting together a full production mean that to present Obedient Steel, Tugboat must raise $5,000.
Where do these dollar bills go towards?

Performance venue rental
Rehearsal space
Material for set, costume, and props
Sound and lighting equipment
Transportation of equipment and materials
Marketing and printed materials

</p><h3>Help Relay Go On Tour!</h3><p>My name is Margit Galanter, and I am going on tour this spring with a piece called <b><i>Relay: Discovering New Species</i></b>. I am a dance poet and movement investigator, and my fascinations regarding the composition and value of movement have drawn me to collaborative embodied research for decades. I teach, curate, organize, write, and practice movement. Specifically in the movement arts, I practice the Feldenkrais Method, Chinese energetics, embodied language practices, and dance. I often hesitate with that final word 'dance,'  because my work is constantly finding new ways to expand perspectives on dance - and by doing so, building connections between things -- people, disciplines, languages, and aesthetics. I work with subtle practices to create conceptual work that springs from the body's ability to know and articulate, which is a long and potent road. </p><p></p>
<p><b><i>Relay: Discovering New Species </i></b>is an evening-length dance poetry performance piece when it interacts with artists in the environment where presented, in collaboration.<b><i> Relay </i></b>will tour both informally in February after a residency in Southern California in Joshua Tree - with presentations in LA and Riverside - then with shows in March in Seattle and NYC, and then in June with a culminating event in the Bay Area. This piece is inspired by a three-year research of dance poetry inspired by the poem <i>Concordance</i> by Mei-Mei Bersenbrugge and Kiki Smith, and 25 traveling interviews I instigated in the summer of 2013. Relay continues to defy the term solo; in each location I am collaborating with local artists to create unique events that spring from the location. </p>

<h3>
<b>Why Fund this Project, and Why Now?</b> </h3>
<p>I am seeking funds for this for a few reasons: Firstly, I am very excited about the research - the nascent fields of <i>dance poetry</i> and <i>movement culture</i> came directly out of my decade's plus research in embodied language, in response to the colleagues, mentors, and field from which my work springs. Over time I have found that the only way to move ideas forward is through enacting and being in conversation; this tour is this very engagement. </p>
<p>A second reason to fund this campaign is that this is a tour, and to make a tour is a big expense (both the traveling and the not-working-during part). Cost of living in art-making is for real, so your support will literally make the tour possible.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is an aspect of this piece which is about <b>felting</b> relations, that the <i>Relay </i>project is indeed an art piece, and it is also a life-practice-cultural investigation in meshing connections, so in earnest, to ask for support is to be indebted to you, and entangles us more deeply, beautifully. I seek to enrich my relations with you all, and hope that this project and campaign can not only bring in income to support itself, but also further open up a dialogue amongst us. </p>
<p>As you may know, I have spent many years supporting other artists as an organizer, curator, and co-director in the arts. Perhaps I have even offered you an opportunity over time. With this project, I am not only making a single work, but integrating my deep curiosity around relational aesthetics, cultural work, and the efficacy of community-building through the arts. I believe in the work enough to ask for support, both artistically and in the ways that the aesthetic material is coherently aligned with the material of the piece.</p>
<p>Your donation will support this tour, where the project will intersect with multiple performers and audiences in several cities, and by signing on now, you will help this project reach its goal of financial sustainability. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/345218/files/20140202165705-composite_2_relay.jpg?1391389025"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3>
</h3><h3><b>More Information:</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p><b><i>Relay:</i></b></p>
<p><i>Relay</i> is a longterm dance poetry project. It
is a three-part dance poetry performance working with material that ranges from
embodying poetry, transducing conversations into <i>practice-actions</i> in space, and studying energetics with
swords. Inspired by the visual poem <i>Concordance</i> by
Mei-Mei Bersenbrugge and Kiki Smith, for three years I have been investigating
particular questions around embodied language, in resonance withplace and
space. In the summer of 2013, I conducted twenty-five traveling conversations
with artist/practitioners in a region of the East Bay (<i>Relay Encounters)</i>. These conversations offered intriguing
perspectives movement, language, and landscape, and set up an ephemeral a web
of relations. This current touring iteration of <i>Relay: Discovering New Species</i> is a composition
experimentally-based on materials of the summers' encounters; while the piece
does not immediately address all of the interactions nor encompass them, the
conversations provided multiple layers of communication which became both
direct and indirect material for the piece. What<i>""Discovering New Species""</i> refers to is the awe of
what it means to make something, for it to be <i>named </i>in a sense  - be it sound or object or action -
that is entirely novel for that moment, yet drawn from what already is. This
delicate place of encountering language and tone is the material of this work.</p>

<p>Over the three years I have been: embodying and performing
segments of the poem through traditional and experimental tactics, writing a
poetry chapbook (<i>Relay transduxions</i>),
exchanging with artists in various disciplines, laying fallow and integrating,
and coming up with terms to meet new regions of practice, such as
""transductions<i>""</i> to
describe the process of taking material from one medium into others, and
""anchoring"" to deal directly with counteracting with confusion and
adrenaline in performing. I tend to take long periods of time to investigate
material when I work, so the art is deeply embedded in with my intellectual,
physical, cultural, imaginal, and aesthetic fascinations over time, and they
cross and exchange with others.</p>
<p>The experiential process of art always interacts in some
way with larger, cultural questions. At every step of this project, I have been
extending what it means to be in solo through multiple forms of conversation.
Actually, this piece is an early step in defining the term and field
""Movement Culture,"" which is coming to be defined like this: embodied
action has deep meaning and is mutually effected by the people and situation of
which it is part. This work as well as the term continues to be redefined
through the people from which is springs and conversations that grow over time.</p>

the threads of this work.</p>
<h3><b>Other Ways You Can
Help:</b></h3>
<p>Of course, if you are unable to offer any direct donations
to the campaign, there are other ways that you could support the project that
would be very valuable. Firstly, It would be so great if you could spread this
campaign, put it up on your wall or site or pass it along via email. This would
be so great! Additionally, if you live in any of the cities where there will be
a public event, you could help with coordinating or getting the word out.
Please get in touch directly, and we can figure this out. Thanks so much!</p>

<p>Triad Health Project is committed to tailoring their services to meet the ever-changing needs of clients.

<p>We realize that it's not always easy to give money- even if you want to.  If you're feeling that you're able to do so, we would love to show our gratitude as best we can.  We can offer tickets to see the show you're helping put up, as well as a private reception with the cast after the opening night performance! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Romeo/Juliet is an experimental adaptation of William Shakespeare’s classic love story. It was adapted and directed by Stefanie Harris employing gender blind casting (ever want to see Mercutio played by a fiesty girl??), movement, and music as part of Spectrum Player’s “Night of Experimental Works” at Hofstra University. Since its premiere in April 2012, Romeo/Juliet has been reworked and rehearsed, and expanded its creative team, including the addition of the production company, Royal Family Productions, Inc. The next step is the production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the largest arts festival in the world. Our venue has been secured and we are officially in the festival. That's where you come in!

It's a NEW year, we have NEW projects and we need your help. </span></span>March 19 - 24, 2013 the ATDF has TWO opportunities to engage, hire and collaborate with a number of dancers, vocalists and musicians where we will be presenting TWO different productions at the Theater at the 14th Street Y. One is entitled “Rhythm is Our Business” and the other is ""Rhythm in Motion"".</p>
<p>""Rhythm is Our Business"" is directed by dancer/choreographer Derick K. Grant and includes additional choreography by 2012 Bessie Award winner Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards and others. It will star a number of local tap dancers, musicians and vocalists including Ali Bradley, Brian Davis, Khalid Hill, Hank Smith, Andrew Nemr, Jason Janas, the Shufflettes, legendary performer Mable Lee and the Duke Ellington Center Band. </p>
<p>Following this production we will be presenting “Rhythm in Motion” which highlights new choreography by SEVEN of our Artists in Residence. Performers and choreographers include the amazing Brenda Bufalino (ATDF's Artistic Mentor), Michelle Dorrance, Derick K. Grant, Kazu Kumagai (from Japan), Max Pollak, Lynn Schwab, our very own Tap City Youth Ensemble, Cartier Williams and others. This production requires working with a standard jazz trio (piano, bass &amp; drums).</p>
<p>Your support will be used to compensate all performance and rehearsal fees associated with these performers. <span>The casts of fantastic tap dancers, vocalists and musicians are currently being assembled and our rehearsals begin in January. We will be posting new content (rehearsal footage) as we progress.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span>For 26 years we've been:</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span>In January of 2010, we moved into our new home at the American Tap Dance Center where we will be rehearsing. Our education programs have grown over the years and so have our students. But there are very few productions for our students to see and be inspired by these days.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span>So, this year we are producing these concerts for our students, their families and the community. W</span></span>e need funding to cover all the artist fees associated with these productions!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>Our philosophy is that Tap Dance is MUSIC and a UNIVERSAL form of </span><span style=""color: #000000;""><span>expression; plus its HEALTHY, FUN, and ACCESSIBLE to everyone!</span></span></p>
<p>Supporting our programs, and helping us raise enough funds for artist fees, will guarantee we have live music in this concert. Dancers will be paid to perform, and our audiences will enjoy TWO new tap dance shows. </p>
<p>Join us in CELEBRATING 26 YEARS of bringing Tap Dance into the world by donating what ever you can!</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donations, large or small, will help make this happen. We have already booked the theater and rehearsals are underway. Tickets are already on sale and we are definately doing this! We just need your support. </p>
<p>If you choose to support these projects, we would like to acknowledge your gift online, on-site and in future monthly newsletters.</p>

Following this production we will be presenting “Rhythm in Motion” which highlights new choreography by SEVEN of our Artists in Residence. Performers and choreographers include the amazing Brenda Bufalino (ATDF's Artistic Mentor), Michelle Dorrance, Derick K. Grant, Kazu Kumagai (from Japan), Max Pollak, Lynn Schwab, our very own Tap City Youth Ensemble, Cartier Williams and others. This production requires working with a standard jazz trio (piano, bass & drums).
Your support will be used to compensate all performance and rehearsal fees associated with these performers. The casts of fantastic tap dancers, vocalists and musicians are currently being assembled and our rehearsals begin in January. We will be posting new content (rehearsal footage) as we progress.
In Case You Don't Know Us
We are the American Tap Dance Foundation, a non-profit 501c3 Tap Dance Organization located in the West Village, New York City.
For 26 years we've been:
- creating new venues and original productions- presenting unique artists and contemporary choreography
- educating the next generation and building new audience
- preserving the American history of tap dance
In January of 2010, we moved into our new home at the American Tap Dance Center where we will be rehearsing. Our education programs have grown over the years and so have our students. But there are very few productions for our students to see and be inspired by these days.
So, this year we are producing these concerts for our students, their families and the community. We need funding to cover all the artist fees associated with these productions!
The Impact
Our philosophy is that Tap Dance is MUSIC and a UNIVERSAL form of expression; plus its HEALTHY, FUN, and ACCESSIBLE to everyone!
Supporting our programs, and helping us raise enough funds for artist fees, will guarantee we have live music in this concert. Dancers will be paid to perform, and our audiences will enjoy TWO new tap dance shows. 
Join us in CELEBRATING 26 YEARS of bringing Tap Dance into the world by donating what ever you can!

What We Need & What You Get
Your donations, large or small, will help make this happen. We have already booked the theater and rehearsals are underway. Tickets are already on sale and we are definately doing this! We just need your support. 
If you choose to support these projects, we would like to acknowledge your gift online, on-site and in future monthly newsletters.


Other Ways You Can Help
Share this project with your friends and families. And if you live in New York, come and see the shows! Many thanks!

<p>HUMANISSIMUS DANCING BAREFOOT is a dance exchange collaboration between Humanissimus and Dance Barefoot. Dance Barefoot is a free dance training program in Haiti created by choreographer Jeanguy Saintus, which benefits young dancers who cannot afford to pay for dance lessons. It is also a place where they can go express their emotions and the daily challenges they face. Vitolio Jeune joined Dance Barefoot when he was 17 years old. He went on to continue his dance education on a full scholarship at New World School of the Arts in Miami Florida. In 2009 he finished top 14 on So You Think You Can Dance season 5 and now he is a senior dancer with the world renowned Garth Fagan Dance in Rochester New York.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>MAKE OUR PROJECT HAPPEN BY PLEDGING YOUR SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>In August 2010 Humanissimus held a 4 day intensive dance training for Dance Barefoot. Because we had little funding, we had to limit the length of the program. This year Humanissimus will orchestrate one week summer dance seminar for Dance Barefoot in Haiti, which will be documented by our filmmaker. We will be taking on a mentoring project through dance by visiting the orphanage where Vitolio Jeune grew up (Our Little Brothers and Sisters of St Helen) to encourage groups of young adults to use dance as a form of self-expression.The program will include master classes, and creative improvisation that will give them the opportunity to develop their personal style of movement to better express their emotions. The dancers will also attend lectures, engage in dialogue on contemporary dance and Caribbean culture, as well as dance criticism. Vitolio Jeune will also choreograph a new dance for the participants, which will be performed at the end of the seminar. Our goal is to encourage these young dancers to continue to pursue their creative dreams, despite any economic disadvantages. Through this program, we hope to establish an intellectual relationship with additional art programs in Haiti and globally. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT YOU WILL MAKE</strong></p>
<p>Humanissimus hopes first and foremost to inspire forty to sixty dancers in Haiti to use dance as a tool to overcome any difficult challenges they face daily. Most of them are still dealing with the 2010 earthquake after-effects, which are both physical but mostly psychological. We want to give them a platform to express their stories and share them with their community and the rest of the world. Humanissimus believes each one of us has an important story to tell, and we want to make it possible for them to share their experience through dance as it heals their mind and spirit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>In total we need to raise a minimum of $10,000. Our financial goal is to cover the cost of the trip, which includes airfare, moderate lodging, gas, and meals for the dancers and our team of four people. The money raised will also cover for the rental of a bus to bring students from the orphanage to Dance Barefoot studio in Petion-Ville (estimate distance 15 Kilometers). Additional funds raised will cover the cost of dance attire and books to help establish a dance library for Dance Barefoot. While our goal is to successfully raise $10,000, we hope that you help us EXCEED that goal. Your donation is highly valuable to these dancers and us; so we thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts. You will get full access to how the program will unfold and our future plans. For questions you can reach us via info@humanissimus.org</p>

<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>We really hope that you are able to donate to our project, as every dollar counts and gets us closer to our goal. However, you can still help and support our project by spreading the word about HUMANISSIMUS DANCING BAREFOOT 2012.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Play or be Played is the first stage play to be produced by GRAFORSHA THEATRE &amp; PRODUCTIONS. The new company is engaged in theatrical and diversified communication activities. Graforsha is dedicated to producing Caribbean plays and will be collaborating with Caribbean and American playwrights. Graforsha is dedicated to the exploration of works from emerging artist. We seek to harness the talents of those who love and hunger for the opportunity to be molded in the arts and to be showcased on stage. Graforsha is dedicated to entertain, educate and influence audiences by introducing Caribbean culture through plays, folklore, storytelling and performance arts. We will create quality theater experiences that confront human morality and purpose in this universe. We strive to revamp arts in the Caribbean communities that will allow artist and audience alike, embrace our rich culture through the medium of theatre.</p>
<p>“Play or Be Played” mirrors the life of a young Christian woman who travels from the Caribbean to the USA, to reunite with her fiancée, in hope of a better life. Reality strikes when she discovers her ‘married’ fiancée is living in squalor and that the stories she has been told about America being a land of “milk and honey” quickly fades.  Soon fear of abandonment, homelessness and deportation threatens her loyalty to her love, and she spirals into a life of frivolous sexual escapades.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to secure funding to produce the stage play; <em>Play or be played On or </em>Off-Broadway.  We need to give the production every opportunity to be seen in front of every individual that cares deeply about immigration, religion, relationship and promiscuity.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $8000. This will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>rehearsal space</li>
<li>performance space</li>
<li>movement workshops for the cast</li>
<li>costumes, props, lights, and any set materials</li>
<li>insurance</li>
<li>posters, flyers  and ad space</li>
<li>stipends for our 9 actors, our stage manager, and our designers</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional funds beyond our goal will be used for administrative costs, community workshops, and future Graforsha Theatre Productions!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the deterioration of funding for great Caribbean plays, Graforsha Theatre &amp; Productions has made it their mission to bring to life Caribbean Theatre to the heart of New York City.   It has proven so far to be a tedious task with the limited resources for Caribbean artist. We are therefore seeking the assistance of everyone, who believe in the art of originality and the belief that every culture or artist must be given equal opportunity to tell their stories through any medium of the Arts. Your contribution irrespective of the amount will become that rock of hope for strong Caribbean Theatre.</p>

<p>HOWEVER! In the event that I do not raise enough funds to attend the training, <em>any donations made to this campaign will go directly to the Warm Springs Elementary School Music Fund in order to purchase instruments or fund an amazing field trip for the students. </em>Rest assured that no matter what, your contribution is going to help the kids directly! </p>
<p>Circus, in my opinion - more than any other art form - has the unique ability to fuse athleticism, theatre, dance, and visual art in such a way as to empower the individual from every angle. <strong>Circus can be everything.</strong> It is the ultimate personal development tool, as it incorporates and engages everything that makes us human - our bodies, our intellect, our ability to connect with, engage, and trust others. No circus artist is ever 'just' a juggler, contortionist, aerialist, stilt-walker - they must also be community-builders, culture creators and multi-faceted artists with intimate knowledge of struggle, self-discipline, and facing fear. Circus is inherently a dialogue between artist and audience, so practitioners have to learn how to engage with and speak to those that watch them. It is also inherently giving and trusting - practitioners must learn to trust their coaches, trust their partners, and most importantly - trust themselves. </p>
<p>I would love nothing more than to see the teaching methodologies for social circus brought to the Native American children I currently work with, and to future students of mine from all walks of life. Being selected to attend this training is a great honor for me, and what I want most is to bring these skills back to those who need it most.</p>
<p><strong>*The teaching methods learned from Cirque du Soleil will be brought directly back to the students I currently teach here in Warm Springs.</strong> There is not currently, nor has there ever been to my knowledge, any opportunity here for children to learn circus arts. I believe that utilizing the methods and techniques of social circus will help boost self-confidence and bring joy to a community still experiencing the emotional, mental and physical consequences of severe historical trauma.</p>
<p><strong>I will incorporate methods learned from Cirque directly into my music classroom, as well as host one or more free after-school workshops this spring, incorporating the structure and training from Cirque, to craft a student-driven performance that the kids can do for the community.</strong></p>

</font></p><p><font size=""3"">EMU Theatre Inc is an independent theatre group based in Lawrence, Kansas. EMU was founded in 1998 by a collective of actors, writers and performers dedicated to creating theatre which fosters a spirit of cooperation and artistic growth among its practitioners, and a spirit of aesthetic adventure in its audience. Over the years we have performed over 35 shows in Lawrence, Wichita and Kansas City, showcasing the talents of local writers along with the works of noted playwrights like Sam Shepard, David Mamet and David Ives. EMU has collaborated with theatre groups in Lawrence and across the Midwest and annually presents 10-minute play festivals, one-act plays and feature length shows. In 2007, we debuted our critically acclaimed annual Halloween show. E.M.U. Theatre is an inclusive association of individuals dedicated to mounting projects which foster a spirit of cooperation and artistic growth among all artists working in the theatre. We believe in providing opportunities, through theatre, for people seeking an outlet for their particular artistic expression. Our goal is to further the appreciation of arts and performance in the Lawrence community while promoting and contributing to our city's rich cultural history. We draw and maintain our strength with an ever-growing membership of veterans and volunteers, keeping the local flavor while expanding the possibilities available in the local arts scene. Idealistic? No doubt. Yet this concept has driven EMU from the beginning and continues to be our foundation. </font></p><font size=""3"">

We draw and maintain our strength with an ever-growing membership of veterans and volunteers, keeping the local flavor while expanding the possibilities available in the local arts scene. Idealistic? No doubt. Yet this concept has driven EMU from the beginning and continues to be our foundation. 

 
 
Over the years, we have made the most of the resources we have had to keep our ticket prices low. We have managed to do a lot with what little we have.  But even the most inexpensive theater production is still a costly affair. Our resources are running low and our best equipment is nearly worn-out from use. So we are asking you, friend of EMU, to help us out by making a tax-deductible contribution to our first ever fundraising campaign!
 
Here is a list of just some of the things your contribution will help us accomplish: 
 
·        Dedicated rehearsal space for our upcoming productions, something EMU has rarely had and which has limited our ability to reach our full potential, especially for large cast shows like our upcoming Shakespeare in the park production of The Tempest.
·        Quality makeup to replace aging makeup supplies that may be dangerous to the health of our performers, and the case to store it in too.
·        Enough extension cords to provide light backstage, as well as on stage, so our actors won’t bump into each other.
·        Storage containers for our meager equipment so that it will stay useful over time, and maybe even . . . 
·        Find a new home for our props, costumes, flats, and equipment so the Sorrels can finally park their car in their garage!
 
Our artists have been held back by limits of living room rehearsals and out-of-date equipment for far too long. Our history proves that we can make a dollar stretch, but we’re ready to flap our stubby little EMU wings and see how high we can get off the ground with a few more dollars. While we’d love to find a sugar daddy with deep pockets, every little bit helps: 
·        Your donation of as little as $10 will buy a storage container to keep our costumes well-preserved. 
·        Your donation of as little as $20 guarantees our performers a full hour of productive, uninterrupted rehearsal time in a reserved space. 
·        Your donation of as little as $40 will buy a quality extension cord to extend our lighting capabilities. 
·        Your donation of $100 will provide a month of storage for our flats and equipment in a secure storage facility. 
·        Your donation of $300 would secure an entire week of uninterrupted rehearsal time in a reserved space (and our undying gratitude). 
 
Your support really means a lot to us and your donation will make a direct improvement in our artists’ abilities to realize their goals.  We hope you will have an opportunity to see your money in action in our upcoming production of The Tempest, directed by Todd Schwartz, in summer 2011 and our next full season of shows beginning in August of 2011.

theatre performance collective, including Joshua Webb, Bryony Cole,
Emily Sitch, Bj McNeill and Nastazja Somers. McNeill
and Somers also run theatre company No Offence Theatre, which brought
the 5 star hit Torn Apart (Dissolution) to Theatre N16 in 2015. Balloons theatre are only in the first year of production and are currently taking the steps needed to power on to make theatre for years to come. Your help would be a massive step towards the future. 
Eastlake Productions, a
production company co producing our Edinburgh transfer ran by Jamie Eastlake, artistic director of Theatre N16 , a ""trailblazing"" company that wants to change the face
of the theatre industry. Eastlake’s career in producing includes
four Edinburgh Fringe productions as well as over twenty across the North East and London. His recent project which he also
directed YOUR EVER LOVING, a political piece about The Guildford Four
has taken the OFF WEST END scene by storm receiving high acclamation
from both the audiences and the critics.Jamie ""Is going to break the big time and do the North East proud"" Newcastle Chronicle. 
The Rules of Inflation
Born from the idea of creating a
political piece of art by exploring the most basic rules and
questioning the pathological patterns of our society, The Rules of
Inflation is an immersive piece of performance art theatre that aims
to make even the most comfortable uncomfortable. 

We live in a world of power, rules and
leaders. But really, it’s all just one big game. Do you want to
come and play? If so, welcome to your childhood dream: a world full
of colours, celebrations, a party, games and… rules? And you know
the rules. You would never dare to break them, would you? Play the
game, balloons and stakes are high and there is no way out. We take
you on a journey where nothing is the way it seems. Come to our party
and meet the other guests: Green, institutionalised and obedient;
Pink, curious, competitive and outcast; Yellow, playful and naïve;
and Blue, abused, objectified and wise. And, of course, our game
controller.
“wild
and pioneering” Grumpy Gay Critic ★★★★

“This
is theatre that stays with you long after the event itself and
compels you to talk about it“  Ginger Wig  ★★★★

“Brilliant
yet highly traumatic(…)Never have I left a theatre more swiftly
after a performance, and never has a play had a more lasting and
profound effect. “ A Younger Theatre 

“The
Rules of Inflation
constantly made me reassess about what I was seeing and feeling”
Female Arts Magazine
Following a highly successful one week
run at Theatre N16 in March “The Rules of Inflation” is now going
to The Edinburgh Fringe and will play at The Space, Surgeons
Hall from 15-20th of August.

<p>We are fundraising to develop and write a new production,
Journey to the Centre of the Earth. This will be an darkly comedic adventure
that examines what happens when we dig down.</p>
<p><b>The story?</b></p>
<p>Four geo-scientist wunderkinden journey to the centre
of Earth to find the answer to climate change. Standing on the drifting plates
of the aesthenosphere, their light goes out. Darkness settles. Panic ensues. In
the darkness, not knowing, they begin to dispute the way forward.</p>
<p><b>Why this show?</b></p>
<p>Plastic, silicon, oil, gas, mining, £££ and the big CC????? (Climate change - but we prefer not to say it out loud.) What does one do about these issues when you're not a scientist and feel the guilty claw around your
neck every time you order an almond milk latte? As performers, we
naturally thought we could don our adventure gear, BECOME the scientists, dig a big hole and see if any answers come to light.</p>
<p><b>Money matters?</b></p>
<p>We were granted an Artist Residency at Fljotstunga (an
eco-farm in the Icelandic wilderness dedicated to supporting international
artists). However, the residency doesn't cover little things like food,
transport and toilet paper.  We've already funded our flights, fees and preliminary research costs, but we need your help to feed and transport the artists while they make brave new theatre! You can also help by sharing this campaign in your
