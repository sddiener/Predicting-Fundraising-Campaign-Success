Also it is said that our Indiegogo goal is $3,000 but really is $1,500. First we apologize for any confusion this may of caused but all of these statements were true at the time of filming. There was a large gap between the time of filming and publishing this because of issues with how to accept the money through our nonprofit the Highlander Educational Foundation or HEF. All of those issues have since been resolved but in that time we received grants, gained additional expenses, and approved an official budget. Large changes like these are what caused the number differences and we hope this clears up any confusion you may have. </p><p><br/></p><p>What is FIRST Robotics?</p><p>FIRST is a program started in 1989 by founder Dean Kamen, inventor of things like the segway and the insulin pump. It started small but has now grown into a world wide event with over 400,000 students involved in over 38,700 teams. FIRST robotics is sold as the sport for the mind and Dean Kamen asks if kids look up to sports superstars why can't they look up to engineers and scientists? There are currently three divisions to FIRST robotics: FLL, FTC, and FRC. FLL stands for the First Lego League which is aimed towards students in grades 4th - 8th. Students are given a series of challenges at the beginning of a build season and are tasked with building a robot out of just Lego Mindstorms to complete the challenges presented to them. FTC stands for the First Tech Challenge which is similar to FLL but it uses a more advanced kit named Tetrix. FTC is aimed at students in the 7th - 12th grade. Students are given a game that they must play with their alliance members and like FLL must construct a robot to play that game. They are also given a certain amount of time to complete the robot. Lastly is FRC, what team 5107 is involved in, which stands for First Robotics Competition. This is very similar to FTC with three major differences: the materials allowed to use, cost of the robots, and the size of the robots. We are given 6 weeks starting on January 3rd 2015 to design and build a robot to play a game presented to us on that day. While this might still be as clear as mud to some here is a video taken at the 2014 world event in St Louis Missouri that should clear it up a bit, <a href=""http://bit.ly/1oXCCyX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/1oXCCyX</a>. </p><p><br/></p><p>How did the team come about?</p><p>This has been copy and pasted from our team website strictly because we feel it is the best and brief summary of where the team has been and plans on going. </p><p><br/></p><p>Pre - Rookie Year</p><p>The idea for team 5107 The Neurotoxins was originated from our current leader, Brenden Geary. He was apart of the 2011 offseason (Logo Motion) at team 2493 Robokong. It was a 30min commute for him to every meeting and head mentor of Robokong, Richard Sisk, urged him to create a FRC team in Inland Empire. He recruited his friends Sean and Ryan Gosiaco as the first editions to the team and quickly added Connor Leonard, Trenton Koeper, Ryan Barnhart, Padrick Osborn, and Liam Austin. We had very little idea on what to do or how to start the team. With lots of help from Richard Sisk we got registered in TIMS and established Tim Geary and Richard Leonard as our mentors. Then it came to money, the haunting $6,000 looming over us that we needed to raise to participate in our first season. We applied for the NASA and Boeing grant as well as holding a BBQ fundraiser at our schools annual Blackwatch wrestling tournament. We did not get much money from the fundraiser but we were fortunate enough to receive the Boeing grant which gave us the money we needed to participate. We were a rookie team now, team 5107!</p><p><br/></p><p>Rookie Year</p><p>On kick off day we went to a local kickoff event in Riverside, CA to watch the broadcast and pick up our first KOP (Kit of parts). We were beyond excited and scared of a possible 3 hour broadcast before we got to know this year's challenge. We were pleasantly surprised when it was not long, 15min, after the broadcast started that the 2014 game was revealed. Aerial Assist was considered the Rookies game because it could be played with a very simple robot. More information on what this years game was and what our final robot turned out to be can be found here <a href=""http://www.team5107.com/robots.html#2014aa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.team5107.com/robots.html#2014aa</a>. The build season was very hectic and fun. The main issue we ran into was that we had no money to buy/make additional ""robot parts"". This caused nearly 100% of additional costs to be completely out of pocket. This was a huge issue that we all agreed needed to be fixed next year. Another issue we ran into was the lack of communication between the entire team. People would make decisions without consulting the group and the team suffered as a result. This was again something we wanted to change next year. Through all of that we were very proud of what we produced and even held second place at the Inland Empire Regional before our claw broke. We finished the event in 31st place and was awarded the Rookie Inspiration award. We had a great time and learned so much in our rookie year and looked forward to our second year as a team. </p><p><br/></p><p>Where is the money we donate going?</p><p>I have added a copy of our approved budget below so you can get an idea of the teams financial need. $16,000 is what the team will need in order to continue to grow and establish itself enough so when its founding members graduate this year the program continues on. We have applied to many grants and are very grateful to have received $5,000 from the Upland Unified School District. This will cover our registration fees for the season which is a huge step in the right direction. We have also received an $8,000 grant from Chaffey College, $1,000 grant from BNI, $500 grant from HEF. This is again a step not the destination we are still $1,500 short of our goal. We have set our goal here on indiegogo at $1,500, but just because our goal is there does not mean we can not surpass it. The real goal of this fundraiser is to make as much money for the team as possible.

<br/><h3>What are we doing?<br/>
</h3> What does a shiny new TUK TUK have to do with access to education for rural children in Cambodia? Here's the low-down:<br/><br/>If this project reaches its funding goal, we will purchase a
 big tuk tuk. During the DAY the tuk tuk will provide free transport to 
70 young Khmer kids who live too rurally to get to school. 
During the NIGHT the tuk tuk will transform into a roving TACO vendor
 - with 100% of profits raised from taco sales going directly back to 
Sala Monkey, that same NGO school that provides free, high quality 
education to kids from desperately poor families living rurally in Cambodia.<br/><br/><p>
 Still following? Practical, smart, effective and freaking delicious. 
Kids go to school, expats and tourists eat tacos and The <a href=""http://salamonkeyschool.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sala Monkey Primary School</a> receives
 sustainable funding. Tick, tick, tick. All the good things. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/955193/files/20141023191314-share_23_.jpg?1414116794"" src="""" style=""""/></p>**This is actually a traditional style tuk tuk. The taco tuk tuk will be a wagon style tuk tuk, accommodating more kids and more room for selling tacos!<br/><br/><p><b>We fully intend to smash the target </b><br/></p>
<p>The funding goal is low and we think we will reach it, but ideally we will smash this target with all of the extra funding going to the school.  It costs $670 per month to operate the FREE school, so any extra funds will be directly used to fund education.  No admin costs, no exorbitant teacher salaries - every dollar will go directly into the education of the 70 plus kids at the school. <br/></p> <div> <h3>Who is Sala Monkey Primary School?</h3>
<p>Hi! My name's Tracy and I'm the founder, director and chief monkey of the <a href=""http://salamonkeyschool.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sala Monkey Primary School</a> here in Kep, Cambodia. We're a small non-profit village school currently educating 70+ of the most impoverished children in Kep; in just a few short years we've gone from teaching basic English conversation to now providing our youngest students with a full UK National and International Primary Curriculum.</p>
<p>Running a non-profit school in rural Cambodia takes funding and we've been fortunate enough to receive the support needed to get the school off the ground and keep it going for a year and a half now. Having donor support is fabulous, but insuring our long term success hinges on generating sustainable income from within.  <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/952854/files/20141022213707-10632658_10152304275451837_6590196442092077819_n.jpg?1414039027"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3><strong>The Tuk Tuk</strong></h3>The idea for the ""Taco Tuk Tuk"" came about through our initial need to acquire transportation for our students. The acquisition of a tuk tuk (Cambodian taxi - motorbike/cart) will serve many important purposes: 1. Providing safe transportation to and from Sala Monkey for the children living at the ASPECA orphanage, who will now be able to receive a quality education with us. 2.Transportation for routine and medical emergency services for our students and their families 3. Picking up school supplies and transporting the children for local field trips. <br/><br/><p><b>Here's where our friends and partners at <a href=""http://madmonkeyhostels.com/current/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Mad Monkey Hostels</a> come in...</b></p>
<p>The team behind Mad Monkey Hostels, a for profit social 
enterprise in Cambodia<b> </b>wants to fund more not<b>-</b>for<b>-</b>profit social 
enterprise projects in Cambodia just like this one.</p>
<p>They have already committed $800.00 of the funds required to make this 
project happen from events and parties<b> </b>and they see Indiegogo.com as a great 
way of widening and sharing participation in a unique idea like this.<br/></p>
<b>Pretty awesome indeed! </b>They also presented us with a challenge...they challenged us to find a way of generating sustainable income with the use of the tuk tuk during the off-hours when the tuk tuk isn't in use. There's already an excess of tuk tuk drivers in Kep providing taxi services, so we figured a taxi service wouldn't be a practical means of generating sustainable income. After some thought, it occurred to us that a tuk tuk would be perfect for selling street food!  Raising awareness and funding for the school. Currently, there are no (non-Khmer) street food options available to the tourists in Kep. In fact there's only a few options available even for Khmer food. <br/><br/><p>I'm a native Southern Californian who came to Cambodia as a teacher and ended up with her own amazing school.  I hail from a place where authentic Mexican food reigns supreme just across the border from Mexico. Logically, what could be a better option for street food here in Kep than offering the beloved street taco? Kep is located on the Gulf of Thailand and is home to the world renowned ""Crab Market"" of Cambodia.  The seafood is literally pulled fresh off the boats and the other fresh ingredients can be found just a short distance away at the local farmers market. Did I mention the homemade tortillas? Yep! Yummy homemade warm tortillas. <br/></p>
<h3><strong>Tacos and Tuk Tuks? <br/></strong></h3>After dark the Tuk Tuk will transform into a pimp my ride like Mexican - Khmer disco 
taco wagon selling delicious tacos to the good people of Cambodia and 
it's visitors.<br/><br/><p>100% of the revenue generated by sales of our delicious tacos will be
 used to fund The Sala Monkey School in Kep - a school that 
provides 100% free education to poor children in rural Cambodia and will
 of course provide employment for at least two local mums.</p>
<p><strong>Let's say that again – 100% of the money we generate will go
 back into providing free quality education to poor kids in Cambodia who 
otherwise would not be able to afford to attend such a school.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>I</strong><b>t gets even better...The Mad Monkey has enlisted the help of the Monkey Army.</b> What in the world is a Monkey Army you ask? It's a loyal following of friends and customers who partner with the Mad Monkey on social projects here in Cambodia. <br/></p>
<p>The Monkey Army has started coming together for a global fundraising event on November 5th to support our Indiegogo campaign.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>So, you're low on funds this month but you love tacos and you want to give underprivileged kids a chance at a better life through education. It's easy to help! Just share, share, and share again...Indiegogo has some awesomely easy to use share buttons. <br/><br/><br/>
</div>
</div></div>","Help Us Reach Our $2,000 Stretch Goal...
We did it! HOSTELWORLD.com has generously donated $2,800 to help fund the entire original goal for our Tuk Tuk Taco Project, which has inspired us to try and reach a little bit further for a stretch goal of $2,000. The stretch goal will help to support our school's operational budget for the next 4 months while we get the mobile taco stand up and running. You can help us by continuing to share our Tuk Tuk Taco project in order for us to reach our $2,000 stretch goal!



What are we doing?
 What does a shiny new TUK TUK have to do with access to education for rural children in Cambodia? Here's the low-down:If this project reaches its funding goal, we will purchase a
 big tuk tuk. During the DAY the tuk tuk will provide free transport to 
70 young Khmer kids who live too rurally to get to school. 
During the NIGHT the tuk tuk will transform into a roving TACO vendor
 - with 100% of profits raised from taco sales going directly back to 
Sala Monkey, that same NGO school that provides free, high quality 
education to kids from desperately poor families living rurally in Cambodia.
 Still following? Practical, smart, effective and freaking delicious. 
Kids go to school, expats and tourists eat tacos and The Sala Monkey Primary School receives
 sustainable funding. Tick, tick, tick. All the good things. 

**This is actually a traditional style tuk tuk. The taco tuk tuk will be a wagon style tuk tuk, accommodating more kids and more room for selling tacos!We fully intend to smash the target 
The funding goal is low and we think we will reach it, but ideally we will smash this target with all of the extra funding going to the school.  It costs $670 per month to operate the FREE school, so any extra funds will be directly used to fund education.  No admin costs, no exorbitant teacher salaries - every dollar will go directly into the education of the 70 plus kids at the school.   Who is Sala Monkey Primary School?
Hi! My name's Tracy and I'm the founder, director and chief monkey of the Sala Monkey Primary School here in Kep, Cambodia. We're a small non-profit village school currently educating 70+ of the most impoverished children in Kep; in just a few short years we've gone from teaching basic English conversation to now providing our youngest students with a full UK National and International Primary Curriculum.
Running a non-profit school in rural Cambodia takes funding and we've been fortunate enough to receive the support needed to get the school off the ground and keep it going for a year and a half now. Having donor support is fabulous, but insuring our long term success hinges on generating sustainable income from within.  

The Tuk TukThe idea for the ""Taco Tuk Tuk"" came about through our initial need to acquire transportation for our students. The acquisition of a tuk tuk (Cambodian taxi - motorbike/cart) will serve many important purposes: 1. Providing safe transportation to and from Sala Monkey for the children living at the ASPECA orphanage, who will now be able to receive a quality education with us. 2.Transportation for routine and medical emergency services for our students and their families 3. Picking up school supplies and transporting the children for local field trips. Here's where our friends and partners at The Mad Monkey Hostels come in...
The team behind Mad Monkey Hostels, a for profit social 
enterprise in Cambodia wants to fund more not-for-profit social 
enterprise projects in Cambodia just like this one.
They have already committed $800.00 of the funds required to make this 
project happen from events and parties and they see Indiegogo.com as a great 
way of widening and sharing participation in a unique idea like this.
Pretty awesome indeed! They also presented us with a challenge...they challenged us to find a way of generating sustainable income with the use of the tuk tuk during the off-hours when the tuk tuk isn't in use. There's already an excess of tuk tuk drivers in Kep providing taxi services, so we figured a taxi service wouldn't be a practical means of generating sustainable income. After some thought, it occurred to us that a tuk tuk would be perfect for selling street food!  Raising awareness and funding for the school. Currently, there are no (non-Khmer) street food options available to the tourists in Kep. In fact there's only a few options available even for Khmer food. I'm a native Southern Californian who came to Cambodia as a teacher and ended up with her own amazing school.  I hail from a place where authentic Mexican food reigns supreme just across the border from Mexico. Logically, what could be a better option for street food here in Kep than offering the beloved street taco? Kep is located on the Gulf of Thailand and is home to the world renowned ""Crab Market"" of Cambodia.  The seafood is literally pulled fresh off the boats and the other fresh ingredients can be found just a short distance away at the local farmers market. Did I mention the homemade tortillas? Yep! Yummy homemade warm tortillas. 
Tacos and Tuk Tuks? After dark the Tuk Tuk will transform into a pimp my ride like Mexican - Khmer disco 
taco wagon selling delicious tacos to the good people of Cambodia and 
it's visitors.100% of the revenue generated by sales of our delicious tacos will be
 used to fund The Sala Monkey School in Kep - a school that 
provides 100% free education to poor children in rural Cambodia and will
 of course provide employment for at least two local mums.
Let's say that again – 100% of the money we generate will go
 back into providing free quality education to poor kids in Cambodia who 
otherwise would not be able to afford to attend such a school.
It gets even better...The Mad Monkey has enlisted the help of the Monkey Army. What in the world is a Monkey Army you ask? It's a loyal following of friends and customers who partner with the Mad Monkey on social projects here in Cambodia. 
The Monkey Army has started coming together for a global fundraising event on November 5th to support our Indiegogo campaign.

<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Who Am I? What's my story? </h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">My name is Mali Fenning and I am a teenage girl from Pennsylvania, who is aspiring to be a leader and change the world. Moreover, My mom is an educational leader in the arts, and my sister is a Junior in High School, who is planning on attending California Berkley for business and non-profits. I truly hope to follow in their footsteps as leaders. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I am currently finishing my last year of Middle School, which I am extremely ecstatic about! Middle School has been an extremely tough time for me, ever sense I returned home from a life changing missions trip to India in 2011 (7th grade). India changed my life, and it caused me to examen every detail of my life as well. I wanted to be completely selfless, I wanted to give my life to God, I also grew beyond my friendships, but most of all I did not want to leave the house. Even though, I wanted to be the best person I could be; I focused on how much I regretted the person I was before, which made me go into an extremely depressive state. Also, it didn't help that when I expressed this to my friends at the time, they rejected me. Though after much trials and tribulation, I am a new person now, and I really am the person I wanted to be coming back from India. However, that experience still is a part of me, and I lost much confidence from it too. And, by attending GLI I will be stronger than I ever have been. Therefore, this won't just be a leadership journey, but a personal journey too.</p>
<h3>       What Is The Girls Leadership Institute? </h3>
<p>        The Girls Leadership Institute was co-founded by Rachel Simmons. Rachel has written four books about adolescent females. The Girls Leadership Institute mission is to teach, ""the practices of emotional intelligence, assertive self-expression and healthy relationships, giving girls the skills and confidence to live as leaders."" Girls Leadership Institute is a program designed to awaken girls to a life of ""authentic leadership"". Furthermore, GLI offers workshops for women of all ages, and summer camp for girls from sixth to twelfth grade. At GLI summer camp, the camp holds art intensives, workshops, a personal project, and the community of all females. In addition, their programs are specifically about developing girls’ “<em>internal</em>” leadership skills, and empowering the strength in young women to become effective, passionate leaders. </p>
<h3>       What Is GLI Going To Do For Me And Why Do I Want To Go?</h3>
<p>       By attending the Girls Leadership Institute I will gain many new experiences, relationships, and strong leadership skills. In addition, here are numerous amount of reasons why I want to attend GLI:</p>
<p> To gain inner confidence that will help form me into an improved leader.</p>
<p> New experience and to branch out from home.</p>
<p> To help influence girls in my community.</p>
<p> To help empower girls in other countries, like when I return to India for a missions trip.</p>
<p> To gain new insights on life, leadership, and myself.</p>
<p> To learn how to build stronger, healthier relationships. </p>
<h3>      What <em>I</em> Need And What<em> You</em> Get</h3>
<p>       What<em> I</em> need is 2,900.00 dollars to pay for my full tuition for GLI summer camp, and in a pretty short amount time. I have received a partial scholarship, however,<strong> if I do not raise all of my tuition for the Girls Leadership Institute on ""Indiegogo,"" than there is a possibility that I will not have the opportunity to attend GLI.</strong> In addition, 100% of your donations to my cause will be going to my tuition for Girls Leadership Institute summer camp. Furthermore, I can't stress enough on how every single dollar helps me get to Bryn Mawr (where GLI summer camp is being held). Also, if I were to raise more than my goal, the extra money will go to gas, paying for trips during GLI summer camp, supplies for camp, and any other expenses that will have to go into GLI summer camp. Now, what <em>you </em>get for donating to my cause depends on what amount of money you donate. For example, if you donate as little as $5.00, you will receive a virtual high-five! Woot! However, if you donate up to $1,000 or more you will receive all of the perks from, ""The Reflective Award,"" and you'll also be receiving a copy of one of Rachel Simmons book, with a personal note from myself. In addition, with every perk you will receive a virtual high-five, and a sincere, personal thank you because by donating, you will have helped me in so many ways you cannot even imagine, and you will have changed my life. </p>
<h3>     Why Should You Send Me To GLI?</h3>
<p>       I understand that there are so many causes, which you are willing to give to, and you want to know why you should give your hard earned money to me. Well, because I am a good investment. Why am I a good investment? Because, by attending the Girls Leadership Institute I will gain self confidence and leadership skills of a life time. By gaining these skills, I will be able to change the world around me, and one day the entire world. My generation has to be the change, and I can help start that change through my experience at GLI. Furthermore, by donating even just a dollar we can get a step closer to a better world.     </p>
<h3>         No Money? No Problem!</h3>
<p>         Of course by sending financial assistance you are helping immensely. However, you can also help by sharing my cause with everyone you know, or even people you don't know! I would appreciate so much if you would take the time to share this link with your friends, neighbors, aunts, uncles, grandparents, co-workers, boyfriends, girlfriends, even people on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook! It would also mean a lot if you kept me in your thoughts and prayers, while I am on this amazing leadership journey. </p>
<p>I am extremely excited that I was given the opportunity to be a part of the Girls Leadership Institute, and by donating you can be a part of my amazing leadership journey.</p>

Who Am I? What's my story? 
My name is Mali Fenning and I am a teenage girl from Pennsylvania, who is aspiring to be a leader and change the world. Moreover, My mom is an educational leader in the arts, and my sister is a Junior in High School, who is planning on attending California Berkley for business and non-profits. I truly hope to follow in their footsteps as leaders. 
I am currently finishing my last year of Middle School, which I am extremely ecstatic about! Middle School has been an extremely tough time for me, ever sense I returned home from a life changing missions trip to India in 2011 (7th grade). India changed my life, and it caused me to examen every detail of my life as well. I wanted to be completely selfless, I wanted to give my life to God, I also grew beyond my friendships, but most of all I did not want to leave the house. Even though, I wanted to be the best person I could be; I focused on how much I regretted the person I was before, which made me go into an extremely depressive state. Also, it didn't help that when I expressed this to my friends at the time, they rejected me. Though after much trials and tribulation, I am a new person now, and I really am the person I wanted to be coming back from India. However, that experience still is a part of me, and I lost much confidence from it too. And, by attending GLI I will be stronger than I ever have been. Therefore, this won't just be a leadership journey, but a personal journey too.
       What Is The Girls Leadership Institute? 
        The Girls Leadership Institute was co-founded by Rachel Simmons. Rachel has written four books about adolescent females. The Girls Leadership Institute mission is to teach, ""the practices of emotional intelligence, assertive self-expression and healthy relationships, giving girls the skills and confidence to live as leaders."" Girls Leadership Institute is a program designed to awaken girls to a life of ""authentic leadership"". Furthermore, GLI offers workshops for women of all ages, and summer camp for girls from sixth to twelfth grade. At GLI summer camp, the camp holds art intensives, workshops, a personal project, and the community of all females. In addition, their programs are specifically about developing girls’ “internal” leadership skills, and empowering the strength in young women to become effective, passionate leaders.

<p>We all know bullying is a serious problem and thankfully there has been a media push to give it the attention it deserves.

There are three ways to win*:  1) Get your school involved. Start by telling everyone you know, maybe post a challenge on Facebook or Twitter, or make flyers with your school's permission. (And if you're not in school, you probably know someone who is and how cool would it be if you helped them get a concert?). Use the hash tags: #LiveStandingUp, #SupportAntiBullying, #Bro5, #Vivoman, #ComeToMySchool. One lucky school will win an exclusive concert for raising the most funds on this Indiegogo campaign. To make your school eligible, please note in the comment field when making your Indiegogo donation the name of your school, the city and state. We'll tally the results and announce the winner in January. 2) How do you #LiveStandingUp? Post an Instagram video of what you stand for that makes the world a better place? Is it freedom of expression through the arts? Is it helping your community? Is it taking care of loved ones? Show us how you live to stand up and our celebrity band ambassadors will pick their favorite ones. Submit by tagging @vivoman, #LiveStandingUp. Five winners will receive the 10th grader perks!3) Post your personal bullying story on Facebook or YouTube. One story will be chosen and that lucky person will win the Super Senior perk! Be brave. Your story could be just the encouragement another kids need. Be sure to tag @Vivoman. * Kids under 18 need parent's permission.Here is our plan. Your donation will go towards:- purchasing anti-bullying wristbands (up to 35 million of them!)- packing/shipping wristbands to schools Our team will be donating staff time, logistical support, and additional promotional tools such as posters and dog tags, to make sure schools have an effective anti-bullying curriculum in place. Change starts with one person standing up for what they believe in. We ask you to stand up today and help this cause. We can get an anti-bullying wristband on every kid in America and create a united front against bullies everywhere. Let's get the word out, together. Please use the Indiegogo share tools and let as many of your friends and family know about our campaign. Chances are you know someone who is/was bullied. Perhaps, it is you. Take a stand and make a real difference. Always live standing up.Thank you.",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Dear valued customers,</p>
<p>I have my own personal life project started, which will not be possible without financial support.</p>
<p>Recently, both of my biological parents have died of cancer and the effects of chemotherapy. Because of the distance and the financial ability, I had little opportunity for them to be there.</p>
<p>Cancer is a really horrible disease that no one deserves!</p>
<p>I have therefore decided to sort my life and start a new medical school. I want to help other people be actively involved in the research. All that I could not afford for my parents.</p>
<p>Also, I want my 5 year old daughter to be proud of me can see me as a role model to want to help other people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm already 32 years old, which means in Germany to get any support handsome, even in the context of health insurance, there is no more perks. It is more than difficult to start with about a 30 degree.</p>
<p>I'm already working way, which leads unfortunately to have less time for my daughter. Unfortunately, this money is not enough to cover all costs. Currently I am trying desperately the cost of textbooks to finance. Without textbooks I will have it very hard.</p>
<p>I would be happy if there are people who want to help me realize this goal / dream.</p>
<p>Even now, I want to thank you from my heart! Ab imo pectore.</p>______________________________________________________________________<p>Liebe Interessenten,</p>
<p>ich habe mein ganz persönliches Lebensprojekt gestartet, was ohne finanzielle Unterstützung leider nicht realisierbar sein wird.</p>
<p>Vor kurzem sind meine beiden leiblichen Eltern an Krebs und den Auswirkungen der Chemotherapien verstorben. Aufgrund der Entfernung und der finanziellen Möglichkeiten, hatte ich kaum die Möglichkeit für sie da zu sein.</p>
<p>Krebs ist eine wirklich schreckliche Krankheit, die niemand verdient hat!</p>
<p>Ich habe daher beschlossen, mein Leben neu zu sortieren und ein Medizinstudium zu beginnen. Ich möchte anderen Menschen helfen, aktiv an der Forschung beteiligt sein. Alles das, was ich für meine Eltern nicht leisten konnte.</p>
<p>Auch möchte ich, dass meine 5 jährige Tochter stolz auf mich sein, mich als Vorbild sehen kann, anderen Menschen helfen zu wollen.</p>
<p>Leider bin ich bereits 32 Jahre alt, was in Deutschland bedeutet, keinerlei stattliche Hilfen zu bekommen, auch im Rahmen der Krankenversicherung gibt es keine Vergünstigungen mehr. Es ist mehr als nur schwer, mit über 30 ein Studium zu beginnen.</p>
<p>Ich arbeite bereits nebenbei, was leider dazu führt, weniger Zeit für meine Tochter zu haben. Leider reicht dieses Geld nicht, um alle Kosten decken zu können. Derzeit versuche ich dringend die Kosten der Lehrbücher zu finanzieren. Ohne Lehrbücher werde ich es sehr schwer haben.</p>
<p>Ich würde mich freuen, wenn es Menschen gibt, die mir helfen wollen, dieses Ziel/ Traum zu verwirklichen.</p>
<p>Schon jetzt, möchte ich mich aus tiefstem Herzen bedanken! Ab imo pectore.</p>

Love, care and nurture. BARC Education will be FUN! We want to engage the kids of Bali and inspire them to care for their fur-brothers and sisters like they would their siblings. We will be holding Movie Nights with fresh (healthy) popcorn featuring Doggy Movies. PLUS we will be performing Puppet Shows and important information all people should know about animals. At BARCS new Adoption and Information Centre we intend to set up a space dedicated to education! We plan to have weekly Doggy Movie Nights JUST for the village children. The Portable Projector can also be taken to other villages where we can set up temporary movie cinemas to showcase the films we as kids (and adults) love to watch! Imagine the delight on the kids faces when they see this special treat. Its moments like these that will resonate with them fur-ever.Additionally we will have puppet shows (a traditional form of Balinese entertainment) and tell the children (and their parents) the Yudhisthira Story! A story from Hindu scriptures about a mans relationship with his dog who he was asked to abandon when he made it to heavens gates. When he said no, he was accepted and passed his final test showing humility for all beings!  Click here to read the full story.We will also hold animal welfare seminars for the adults on animal health and welfare, puppy and dog training and so much more! What We Need & What You GetIt's a very simple set up with a few overhead costs to make it just right! We need to raise $3000 to cover the following
Portable Projector (so we can go to other locations)
Speakers
Bean Bags
Paint (for the screen wall)
Popcorn Machine (because you can't have a movie without pop-corn right?!)
Kids Doggy DVDs
Bilingual Education Banners to cover the walls
The ImpactTo start changing the perception of animals and their treatment in Bali we need to focus our attention on the next generation. The generation that will grow up to love and care for the animals, and to speak up when they know an animal is not being treated or cared for properly. This kind of impact is PRICELESS! Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>We are a group of ten students from Vergennes Union High School (VUHS) located in Vergennes, Vermont who will be traveling to the southern tip of Ghana for a service trip to the Trinity Yard School (TYS) in Cape Three Points, Ghana. This trip will take place from February 13-27, 2013. </p>
<p><strong>About Trinity Yard School</strong></p>
<p>TYS was established in 2007 by Vermonter Rory Jackson and is a place students from local villages on Cape Three Points are able to obtain a secondary education.  This was an opportunity not available to them before this school was established. The TYS provides a fee-free secondary education with a focus on English, math, and a variety of vocational workshops.   Not only does TYS enrich the lives of their students and help them locate apprenticeships upon graducation, it also creates these enrichment opportunities for it’s Ghanaian staff and volunteers/students from abroad who participate in the school’s development.   For more on TYS, please visit <a href=""http://www.trinityyardschool.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.trinityyardschool.org/</a></p>
<p><strong>Student Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Upon hearing about an opportunity to travel and donate time to TYS, we ten students from VUHS felt that this was an experience not to pass up and began working on a plan to make this goal a reality.  We will be working with TYS students on academic writing in English Composition.   We will design this writing course in collaboration with our English teachers and other staff to gather subject matter and resources to prepare and design our TYS project.  </p>
<p>In exchange, the students from TYS will offer us a course in arts-oriented trades such as Batik tie and dye and traditional Kente weaving.    We will also have opportunities to learn dance and drumming as well as participate in the daily chores of living in a place without electricity and machines.   As part of this trip we will also have the opportunity to visit the Akwidaa River, the Cape Three Points Forest Reserve, and Cape Coast to visit the slave forts.  </p>
<p>In addition to academics, we students have many other activities in our lives, such as sports and music, but we have made time together to formulate ideas on how to fundraise for this trip so that all ten of us can take part in this amazing opportunity.  So far we have hosted a public event for other students, held bake sales, sold flowers at local farmers markets and are selling firewood. </p>
<p><strong>Fundraising and What We Need</strong></p>
<p>With our trip’s deadlines fast approaching, the reality of going on this trip is in jeopardy for some of us. This trip is very important to each of us and feel we can make a real contribution to the students in Ghana and well as gain experiences we could never dream of. </p>
<p>The cost for each of us to take this trip is a total of $3,142.  This covers air fare, transportation in Ghana, excursions, staff, materials (water filters, mosquito netting, hygeine supplies), food, and an education fund donation to TYS.  We need to pay a total of $31,142 to make this trip a reality.   Raising money for this service trip will ensure  that all 10 of us can take this trip.   It will also give us a chance to take a journey that will change our perspectives for the rest of our lives.  </p>
<p>We are kindly asking for a donation so we can see our service project to TYS become a reality for each of us.  Your donation would be greatly appreciated by all parties involved!</p>
<p>If you are unable to make a contribution at this time PLEASE help us spread the word and share our story with your friends.    </p>

TYS was established in 2007 by Vermonter Rory Jackson and is a place students from local villages on Cape Three Points are able to obtain a secondary education.  This was an opportunity not available to them before this school was established. The TYS provides a fee-free secondary education with a focus on English, math, and a variety of vocational workshops.   Not only does TYS enrich the lives of their students and help them locate apprenticeships upon graducation, it also creates these enrichment opportunities for it’s Ghanaian staff and volunteers/students from abroad who participate in the school’s development.   For more on TYS, please visit http://www.trinityyardschool.org/
Student Exchange
Upon hearing about an opportunity to travel and donate time to TYS, we ten students from VUHS felt that this was an experience not to pass up and began working on a plan to make this goal a reality.  We will be working with TYS students on academic writing in English Composition.   We will design this writing course in collaboration with our English teachers and other staff to gather subject matter and resources to prepare and design our TYS project.  
In exchange, the students from TYS will offer us a course in arts-oriented trades such as Batik tie and dye and traditional Kente weaving.    We will also have opportunities to learn dance and drumming as well as participate in the daily chores of living in a place without electricity and machines.   As part of this trip we will also have the opportunity to visit the Akwidaa River, the Cape Three Points Forest Reserve, and Cape Coast to visit the slave forts.  
In addition to academics, we students have many other activities in our lives, such as sports and music, but we have made time together to formulate ideas on how to fundraise for this trip so that all ten of us can take part in this amazing opportunity.  So far we have hosted a public event for other students, held bake sales, sold flowers at local farmers markets and are selling firewood. 
Fundraising and What We Need
With our trip’s deadlines fast approaching, the reality of going on this trip is in jeopardy for some of us. This trip is very important to each of us and feel we can make a real contribution to the students in Ghana and well as gain experiences we could never dream of. 
The cost for each of us to take this trip is a total of $3,142.  This covers air fare, transportation in Ghana, excursions, staff, materials (water filters, mosquito netting, hygeine supplies), food, and an education fund donation to TYS.  We need to pay a total of $31,142 to make this trip a reality.   Raising money for this service trip will ensure  that all 10 of us can take this trip.   It will also give us a chance to take a journey that will change our perspectives for the rest of our lives.  
We are kindly asking for a donation so we can see our service project to TYS become a reality for each of us.  Your donation would be greatly appreciated by all parties involved!
If you are unable to make a contribution at this time PLEASE help us spread the word and share our story with your friends.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>“We all chew and spit the same. So for this one purpose we are just people chewing sunflower seeds.” Noam Edry, project leader.</p>
<p>A humorous Middle-Eastern response to Ai Weiwei's ""Sunflower Seeds"". People travel to neighbouring cities in the Middle-East to sit together for a few days and chew sunflower seeds, spitting the empty shells on the ground until they form a massive heap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR PURPOSE…</span></strong></p>
<p>In this project, Israeli interdisciplinary artist Noam Edry invites people from neighbouring cities in the Middle East to come together and chew a total of 10 tonnes of sunflower seeds. The shells are then collected to form an art installation and will be exhibited in London, along with a documentary film about the entire process and the people behind each and every shell.</p>
<p><br/> SEEDS OF BLISS /גרעינים / بذر brings together individuals who would otherwise have little chance of meeting to share the simple pleasure of chewing sunflower seeds. Noam Edry plans 3-5 day long cracking adventures titled ""Big Chews"" in neighbouring cities where people sit together, eat sunflower seeds and socialize.<br/><br/> The paired neighbouring cities so far include:<br/> – Aqaba (Jordan) and Eilat (Israel);<br/> – Nablus (West Bank) and Haifa (Israel);<br/> – Jenin (West Bank) and Afula (Israel).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR STORY SO FAR…</span></strong></p>
<p>The project’s opening event, ""The Big Chew"", was held on 23 August 2012 at the artist's birthplace, Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan, in the North of Israel, where community members and residents of nearby Arab-Bedouin villages Khawaled and Ibtin as well as Shfaram and Zarzir chewed together the first few kilos of sunflower seeds. A tub full of shells was amassed. Later on there will be another ""Big Chew"" in the Village of Khawaled, in collaboration with the people of Kibbutz Ramat-Yohanan.</p>
<p>On the 9<sup>th</sup> September 2012 a team of Jewish and Arab Israelis travelled to Aqaba for 5 days to sit and chew sunflower seeds with the Jordanians at Al Firdous Café (Paradise Café) owned by Hasan Selmi in the city center. They brought with them 100 kilos of sunflower seeds, which they carried by hand in large sacs across the border. They cracked the seeds together with the Jordanians all over Aqaba; in restaurants and cafes, on the beach, in alleys, in private homes and even out at sea. Every evening from 9pm onwards there was a mass shelling of seeds at Al Firdous Café, where more than a hundred people sat together to crack sunflower seeds. The Jordanians gave the Israeli team a warm welcome and hosted them with open arms, inviting them into their homes and accompanying them throughout the five-day trip. Word of the ""Big Chew"" spread across the city and hundreds came to Al Firdous Café to take part, including the workers of the Mosque, the police force and the tax officers who helped to transfer the seeds across the border.</p>
<p>The members of the Jordanian team from Aqaba are currently awaiting their visa from the Israeli Consulate in Amman in order to be able to come for a 5-day visit to Eilat and to crack seeds with their new friends from Israel. The team will include approximately 10 people.</p>
<p><br/> On 3 October 2012 a chewing team from Nablus came to the ""Art and Street Culture"" Festival in Haifa, to crack seeds with an estimated 100,000 visitors. Most of them had never visited Haifa before.</p>
<p>The Big Chews in Eilat and Nablus are planned to take place in November.<br/><br/> The Big Chews in Afula and Jenin will take place in December.<br/><br/> Some might say that it will take as long to reach 10 tonnes of shells, as to reach peace in the Middle East. But Noam Edry emphasizes that at the end of the day what counts is the “quality” not the “quantity” of the chewing. “The goal is to have a meaningful encounter and to develop a real friendship"". <br/><br/> SEEDS OF BLISS /גרעינים / بذر project is in collaboration with the Haifa Museum of Art and Artis Contemporary. The seeds have been donated by Zarubi Seed Company, owned by Khalid Zarubi, with further contributions from Hazera, Migdan and many kibbutzim as well as private donors. The Haifa-Nablus Big Chews are partially sponsored by Haifa City Council and Nablus Governorate.<br/><br/> The project is documented by Shula Covo.</p>

It makes their self confidence, teamwork abilities, and academic skills grow immensely, while having fun!In addition to a profound, hilarious, original script, we have an eager and talented cast (ages 5-19) and director (age: 42 and feeling it), a wonderful performance space--Intermedia Arts, and musicians willing to donate time and music.We need money to rent performance space and tech stuff, hire helpers, and get prop/costumes supplies. We also need snacks for hungry performers. We plan to do at least 3 shows for the public May 23,  24, 25, 2014.Please note: We are into GREEN THEATER meaning we use recycled/reclaimed materials for over 90% of our needs in producing this show.Gaia Democratic School is a small, independent, private school for K-12 grade students. We operate democratically and encourage students to be active in their own education. Gaia DS supports each student's right to learn in ways that best fit their unique learning styles, interests, and abilities. Gaia DS believes in freedom--of expression, movement, speech, intellect, and to choose what and how to learn.I couldn't get the following to work on my Bio page so here is a list of youth plays/musicals I have had the honor of directing over the years:Mayday Festival stage (1990) We did an anti-garbage burner show.Persephone's Descent (at Playwrights Center, 1993) This was a collection of short performances that was based on a writing class. One piece was entirely made up of conversations overheard in the Hard Times Cafe.Enter At Your Own Risk (1995) Southern Theater: An original collaboratively written show in partnership with Project Offstreets' Kulture Klub (Homeless Youth)I Wrote This Play to Impress My Parents (1996) at the Southern Theater Original & collaboratively written, mostly by Erin Tate, who is now the Drummer for the band Minus the Bear. I played a psycho mother & Jay H. was a wingnut cop. There was a live snake at the end.Circus Maximus (1997-8) An original collaboratively written circus themed-show, multiple performance sites, including Mpls. City Parks--also when the GYM MURAL was first painted.Damn Fine Casserole (Peoples Center & Bedlam, 2001) An original collaboratively written show about stereotypes featuring fantasizing housewife Alberta smashing dishes & Eliot as Suzie--a beautiful, suicidal, suburban, princess. William was an alligator, Mae was Martha Stewart, & Jazmin was the gay boy, Billy. Casey was the statue of Liberty & I’m pretty sure she “gave birth” to Eliot at the end & then came the cherry jello placenta, yum.Hodgepodge (Bedlam, 2002) A collection of random one acts by SFS students, including Helen & Marvel's ""Toast"" & Emme’s first play with SFS.Rocky Horror Picture Show (Walker Church, 2003) with all live music by the Eliot (who also played Meatloaf), Luke, Klaus, (ala Dangerboy & the Road Vultures or Tornado!) & Travis, Charlie as Frank, Emily & Jazmin as Janet & Brad, Emme & Isaac as Majenta & Riff Raff, Ben as the Investigator. Shadow puppets! Absolutely so much fun!MaskRaid (Walker Church, 2004) An original collaboratively written show based on twisted versions of Wizard of Oz, Alice & Wonderland, Where the Wild Things Are... Awesome, original music by Travis, Anna as the Queen of Hearts (that plastic wig!), Tre as ""genderless"" Alix, Johann as Max, and Martha/Emme as Good/Bad Alice. Marina spoke the sacred tree poems & Isaac was The Man with Plan. There was a Barbie Army?!The Bacchae (Varsity, 2005) Starring Andre (who is teaching in Poland now) & many amazing madwomen including Wonder Woman played by Ariel (previously Annie) Pinkerton. Using the Wole Soyinka translation from the ancient Euripides script, we added characters, humor, & music by Starri, Kata & Dimitry. As one of the very first shows at the now-popular Varsity venue, it was a stunning environment for our tribute to the God of Wine and Dance. Remember the sheep? & Mike describing the sheep? Jake & his Village people line. Dru & his bursting appendix, making me think the madwomen had truly eaten him alive.Wonderland  (Bedlam, 2006)    Emme & I were both fascinated by the amusement park that was in our South Minneapolis neighborhood 100 years ago (Lake St. & 31st). We began to research & create characters, scenes, & songs based on our discoveries. We shot a video in the cemetery where some of the displayed incubator babies are buried. Music by Eatin' Hogeye, Emme, & Starri. Highlights: the church ladies & preacher man, the street kids, Eeka & ElDiablo, the crazy doctor & smoking nurse, the fortune teller & Xelias Aerial Arts.Fools Eye or the Adventures of the Joyfully Disturbed (Bedlam 2007) We wrote this script entirely from dreams! There was also a lot of Tarot ideas. Highlights: Hassan as Pepsi-makes-me-fly guy, Luna as Kitty, Light & Dark, Sandman, Riva’s zillion costume changes, the hermit video of commercials taking over dreams & Emme’s video of the ocean, Ian as the “bad man” (scary!) and the lovely whisperers.Goodbye Berlin: Cabaret with Liberty Taken (Bedlam, 2008) music director: Mark Garcia...and those great musicians. We took the short story turned play turned movie turned broadway musical, old classic & rewrote it---making it even more intense than it was before! Highlights: the gorilla head/s, 2 Ladies, the German crystal available in the lobby, the blue rabbit coat, the chair dance & the Hard Knock Life Kids. Remember Nara’s tomorrow!? Wow.Crybaby (Bedlam, 2009) music director: Mark Garcia & those awesome musicians again! With Riva & Marissa as Johnny Depp/Crybaby & Allison & the Walker family/gang  played by: Calem (Ramona), Treana (HatchetFace), Jadeen (IggyPop), Emme as Pepper & Rainy & Nara as her kids & Kimmy as Lenore.............I just know we would have made John Waters proud! Classic 1950’s music. So many highlights!!!3 (an original tragedy in fractions at Peoples Center, 2010) Collaboratively written by Emme, Jadeen, Bree, Riva, Starri based on mythology & heartbreak,the Selkie & the unicorn, the gollum, centaur & Bird, of course. From the press release: Let us take you on a magical, dismal journey that transcends time and space! Blending fantasy, mythology, and science fiction to create a series of epic adventures throughout the ages, ""3"" features: a beautiful spirit stolen by vampires, a bride and groom parted by a jealous, malicious god, two star-crossed, drugged-up,genetically-altered, futuristic lovers, one mysterious troubadour-witch, and a swarm of fickle, wicked fairies.MUSIC BOX (People's Center Theater, 2011) Collaboratively created coming of age story set in Minneapolis-- a rollicking, magical-realism adventure exploring the dreams & memories of 4 life-long friends, featuring ghosts, thieves, unreal twins, & a mighty strange musical Wizard.And the Devil Will Drag You Under an original production led by Bree McPherson with music by Lady of the Red Heart starring Sage Doring as the Devil himself, Bree, Sara Anderson, Sadie Morris, Zion Braveheart, Sophia Stenwick, Baylee Floyd as Angela , Jeune Mayer as Diablo. Jack & Joe were hilarious!Down the Rabbit Hole- a mash up of Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass, and The Matrix.

<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To realize this exciting vision, we will be leading a series of theatre, puppetry and music activities with students at Ramana's Garden School in Rishikesh, India, during Feb/March 2015, investigating ideas of self-image and identity. Artist facilitator Maggie Winston was introduced to the Ramana's Garden School in 2010 when she came to Rishikesh to study meditation and spirituality. She is now a disciple of Sri Prem Baba of Brazil, who gives spiritual teachings in the Vedic Tradition (Saccha Baba Lineage) at Saccha Dam Ashram in Rishikesh, India. And this arts initiative is inspired by these teachings, following the principles of the ""Awaken Love"" project. <a href=""http://www.sriprembaba.org/en/the-birth-of-awaken-love"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sriprembaba.org/en/the-birth-of-awaken-love</a>.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">During our arts engagements, we will use interactive
theatre techniques, drawing upon true-to-life situations, and facilitating open
dialogue to inform the artistic product. The information gathered from these exercises
will be used to create a puppet that will represent each participant.  Then, stories
will be devised for the puppets and the actors to play out. The students will also compose music to accompany </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">their</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> narrative content. And all engagements will lead to a final
performance that will ultimately be shared with fellow students and local
community members.  Finally, most appropriately, all of the musical instrument and puppetry elements will be
created out of found objects (trash) and reclaimed materials, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">collected from the students' environment</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Prior
to our arts engagements in Rishikesh, we will also lead the same activities with
students in Southeast Vancouver, who will communicate with the students in India by initiating a pen pal letter exchange. 
Like their Indian peers, this primarily South Asian neighbourhood has
limited access to the arts and many children do not often have the opportunity
to engage themselves in creative activities. We expect this rich cultural exchange to foster understanding between these children, about similarities and differences in each other's lives.  </span></p>

<div>By participating in <i>Trash Talk Recycled:</i>

<p>·<span>  Students, t</span>hrough truthful investigations during the art-making process, will develop an
understanding of themselves in relationship to large global issues affecting
the environment- identifying personal responsibility. </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Students
will also have a greater understanding of themselves in terms of the ways in
which they might “trash” their own or others' thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Vancouver students will have the rare opportunity to develop relationships with students at Ramana's Garden (a school for orphaned children in Rishikesh, India), building empathy within both groups.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Students
will gain experience and confidence by creating an original collaborative
performance that they can acknowledge as their own.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Students
will develop working/playing relationships with the artists, each of whom has established community ties in the neighborhoods where both the Vancouver and Indian schools are located.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Students
may be inspired to involve themselves in future social/environmental activism.</p>

Both of us have been deeply moved by the people and places that we have experienced on our travels to India.  However, we also share concerns about the trash problems that we have observed while visiting this fascinating and complex country.  So, these have inspired us to develop an arts-based youth program that will allow students to explore their feelings about the concept of ""trash"" in our world and in ourselves (i.e.“trash thinking.”)



To realize this exciting vision, we will be leading a series of theatre, puppetry and music activities with students at Ramana's Garden School in Rishikesh, India, during Feb/March 2015, investigating ideas of self-image and identity. Artist facilitator Maggie Winston was introduced to the Ramana's Garden School in 2010 when she came to Rishikesh to study meditation and spirituality. She is now a disciple of Sri Prem Baba of Brazil, who gives spiritual teachings in the Vedic Tradition (Saccha Baba Lineage) at Saccha Dam Ashram in Rishikesh, India. And this arts initiative is inspired by these teachings, following the principles of the ""Awaken Love"" project. http://www.sriprembaba.org/en/the-birth-of-awaken-love.   
During our arts engagements, we will use interactive
theatre techniques, drawing upon true-to-life situations, and facilitating open
dialogue to inform the artistic product. The information gathered from these exercises
will be used to create a puppet that will represent each participant.  Then, stories
will be devised for the puppets and the actors to play out. The students will also compose music to accompany their narrative content. And all engagements will lead to a final
performance that will ultimately be shared with fellow students and local
community members.  Finally, most appropriately, all of the musical instrument and puppetry elements will be
created out of found objects (trash) and reclaimed materials, collected from the students' environment.




Prior
to our arts engagements in Rishikesh, we will also lead the same activities with
students in Southeast Vancouver, who will communicate with the students in India by initiating a pen pal letter exchange. 
Like their Indian peers, this primarily South Asian neighbourhood has
limited access to the arts and many children do not often have the opportunity
to engage themselves in creative activities. We expect this rich cultural exchange to foster understanding between these children, about similarities and differences in each other's lives.  





What We Need & What You Get
Fortunately, all of our workshop expenses ($8,760) in Vancouver and India have already been covered by the non-profits, Instruments of Change (instrumentsofchange.org) and ArtStarts (artstarts.com).  So, we are only asking our Indiegogo supporters to help us raise enough funding to cover our travel expenses to India ($4,000 TOTAL).In exchange, you will enjoy profuse thanks from the student and facilitating artists, as well as a range of music, puppetry and spirituality-related gifts of appreciation (depending on your level of contribution).

  The Impact
By participating in Trash Talk Recycled:
 
·  Students, through truthful investigations during the art-making process, will develop an
understanding of themselves in relationship to large global issues affecting
the environment- identifying personal responsibility. 
·  Students
will also have a greater understanding of themselves in terms of the ways in
which they might “trash” their own or others' thoughts and feelings.
·  Vancouver students will have the rare opportunity to develop relationships with students at Ramana's Garden (a school for orphaned children in Rishikesh, India), building empathy within both groups.
·  Students
will gain experience and confidence by creating an original collaborative
performance that they can acknowledge as their own.
·  Students
will develop working/playing relationships with the artists, each of whom has established community ties in the neighborhoods where both the Vancouver and Indian schools are located.
·  Students
may be inspired to involve themselves in future social/environmental activism.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello CMCers! About a year ago a bunch of CMCers -- Dan Taylor ('04), Miles Orton ('04), Nicolas Heidorn ('06) -- were sitting around drinking some beers (of course) at a quasi-political event (of course). Somehow a discussion broke out over how few people know much of anything about the Federalist Papers today, even though the debates of that era remain relevant in many contexts -- for instance, what role should the federal government play over the states in taking on health care reform? The conversation later meandered to how cool it was that CMC (through the Keck Center) allowed students to compete to do research and write a paper in certain areas, but that once you had the money it could be a bit hard to be motivated to write an awesome paper with so many other commitments clammoring for attention. We put two and two together and the Federalist Project was born! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Federalist Project is an essay competition: students must submit 8-14 page papers on any topic relating to the Federalist or Anti-Federalist Papers and the winning essay wins $1000. The winner will be given his award along with graduating Seniors at the awards ceremony.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The hope is that this essay competition will help spur further interest in the Federalist Papers. Also, we hope this will put more emphasis on CMC's gov department, one of our school's traditional strengths that of late has been a bit overshadowed by the econ department. Curse you, highly successful econ department!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We decided to set the essay prize at $1000, the same amount as the Keck Center fellowships and an amount we hope will encourage a good number of applicants. Thus, we need to raise $1000! All the money goes straight to CMC so is tax-deductible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, that's not all, in addition to that you get:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under $20: the pride and bragging points of having supported the alma mater!</p>
<p>$20-$50: a poster of the essay competition!</p>
<p>$50+: the option of being one of our essay judges!</p>

<h3>Since 2009, thinkpeace workshop for girls has been inspiring girls to use their voices and actions to create peace in their homes, schools, communities, and the world.   </h3>
<p>By exploring the self through yoga, journaling, art, and discussion girls are able to discover their inner voice and passions.  By collaborating on outreach projects, story telling, performance pieces, and more, girls are able to discover the power they have when they join their voices with girls worldwide.  </p>
<p>Thinkpeace girls learn skills that truly empower them to be agents of change in the global girl community:</p>

<li>accepting self and others</li>
<li>communicating effectively</li>
<li>resolving conflicts</li>
<li>understanding intercultural differences</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>We believe that camps and workshops need to be filled with girls reflecting the diversity of the real world. We would like our workshops to be available to girls from the inner city and rural areas as well as suburban communities.  In 2012 we personally funded 5 scholarships to our summer camp.  These 5 girls brought a diversity to the group that reinforced our belief that similarities and differences should all be valued and celebrated. Every voice is vital to the peacemaking process.  In 2013 we will include at-risk girls to our thinkpeace community, a group of girls who are rarely given the opportunity to learn how to 'be the change' they wish to see in their communities.

</div>
<div>
<p>The strength, confidence, knowledge and relationships each girl leaves our camps and workshops with is only the beginning. Thinkpeace girls become agents of change in the world in very unique ways. From California to Germany our girls have embraced art activism as a means to raise awareness about the ongoing genocides around the world.  They have collected undergarment donations and have sewn cloth sanitary napkins and belts for women and girls in Haiti, Zimbabwe and Uganda.  They have launched enironmental animal cruelty awareness campaigns.  They have held community bicycle rides/fundraisers on behalf of girls in Afghanistan and other countries who are not allowed the freedom felt from riding a bike. They have campaigned to end the practice of child marriage and have been ardent supporters of a girl's right to an education.</p>

<p>Your donation to our program has a ripple effect.  After attending a thinkpeace workshop, girls are required to continue with a project or cause that strikes a chord within her, 'Paying it Forward' by giving back to her community or to an global project.  We work with the girls to help them achieve their goals, create connections with other organizations they can volunteer with, or help fund their projects.  </p>

<p>After attending <a href=""warpedtour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warped Tour</a> in 2008 and not finding any gender or sexual minority representation in their non-profit area, I saw not only a gap, but an opportunity to bring about a massive change in the music community.  I founded Equalize, an organization dedicated to educating music fans about issues that affect the sexual and gender minority communities and giving folks (both LGBTQ and straight allies!) the tools to create positive changes in the world.<br/><br/>I've always felt that I've had to keep my sexuality and gender identity, my passion for social justice, and my music separate from each other, but through Equalize, I've discovered that there are so many people like me in the world that want to mix the three together.  We want to create a safe space not only in places like the Warped Tour, but the world as a whole, where people can be themselves, no matter who they are or whom they love.</p>
<p>We have attended Warped Tour in Portland every year since we started, but it's time to Equalize the east coast!  With your help, we will be attending six dates of the tour in some of the largest cities in the country: New York, Boston, DC, and more, starting conversations about equality with literally thousands of young music fans, as well as providing a place for people to express who they are completely.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Going on Tour</h3>
<p>All of the Equalizers going on Mission: Equalize Warped Tour have been on the road before.  We know how to cut costs while still ensuring a safe and healthy tour.  Our budget of $2500 includes transportation to Boston, where we will be starting, a rental car to get us from city to city, gas, food, admission, supplies, literature, and merchandise.<br/><br/>Being an Equalizer doesn't just mean standing up against oppression for people in the LGBTQ community, but for the planet as a whole!  So, during the tour, we will be doing what we can to have as small an impact on the environment as possible.  These measures include getting a car with a high MPG, and making a commitment to produce as little food product waste as we can by having reusable containers and utensils for everyone.</p>

<h2>What is an Onomatopoeia?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480403735/jdsd04hdinfgkl5yqfvp.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Onomatopoeia is a word adopted from the French language ""onomatopée"". In Japanese, we call them imitative words and mimetic words; ""<i>giongo</i>""<i> </i>and<i> </i>""<i>gitaigo</i>"". </p>
<p>Onomatopoeia is used frequently in the Japanese language. For example, the rain is falling heavily ""ザーザー(<i>za:za:</i>)"" and the stars are twinkling ""きらきら (<i>kira-kira</i>)"". Undoubtedly every language has onomatopoeia, but it seems that despite the number of words or species, they are not as succinctly used in these other languages as they are in Japanese. That is the reason why the Japanese language is referred to as a language fertile in onomatopoeia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480403906/zzzswmt3gwxa4dc2lrdm.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Speech sounds which express the natural noise of things, such as ""buzz"", ""crackle"", ""splash"", and ""wail"" are called imitative words. Imitative words are divided into two parts: non-living things' noises, such as ""tap"" at the door/""トントン(<i>ton-ton</i>)"", and the living things' sounds, such as ""bow-wow""/""ワンワン(<i>wan-wan</i>)"" and ""meow""/""ニャーニャー(<i>nya:nya:</i>)"".<br/><br/>Mimetic words are speech sounds which describe the soundless movement, condition, and situation of inanimate or living things, including human beings. Mimetic words are divided into three kinds: showing the condition of non-living things, such as ""glittering""/""きらきら(<i>kira-kira</i>)"" and ""slippery""/""つるつる(<i>tsuru-tsuru</i>)"", showing the condition of living things, such as ""groggy""/""ふらふら(<i>fura-fura</i>)"" and ""loitering""/""のろのろ(<i>noro-noro</i>)"", and showing human feelings, such as ""impatiently""/""いらいら(ira-ira)"" and ""excitedly""/""わくわく(<i>waku-waku</i>)"" .</p>

<br/>About this site</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479279688/m0o4d9jrjdncj50hxlcx.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>This is teaching material that goes beyond words that never existed before. Most of its features are free and for those who want to get deeper into the world of onomatopoeia, a membership page is available to you for only 500 yen/month.</p>
<p>Japanese people learn these imitative words, mimetic word, and echoic words together with their senses as they grow up. These words are very much rooted in Japanese customs, culture, tradition, and aesthetics, as well as senses. Therefore, once you are able to understand the nuances and grasp the image of these expressions, I am sure you will find your Japanese enriched in various ways.  Furthermore, these words should enable you to get to know us, the Japanese people, better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Trustworthiness of the teaching materials</h2>
<p>There were two essential tasks for this project.<br/>①How do I correctly understand the meanings of Japanese onomatopoeias?<br/>You might have noticed I am not an expert in linguistics, and it would dangerous to use only my own understanding. I considered using online resources, but I don't have access to the rights of online dictionaries. I decided to contact Meiji University's Professor Masahiro Ono, who has published Japan's largest onomatopoeia dictionary, with 4500 entries.</p>
<p>I presented him with this project and he decided to let me use his data, which later became the foundation for my website. But 4500 words is too extensive and some of these words are outdated, so I  narrowed the scope down to the  450 most important, commonly used words.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479367155/mfkjgmslzjq9meft3afz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>②Who is going to translate the material?<br/>At first, I met Tokyo Metropolitan University's Professor Jiro Nishigori, who does research in Onomatopoeia and creates websites for non-Japanese speakers himself. He was fascinated by the sample of my website, and introduced me to two alumni of Edith Cowen University in Australia who have Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPY) competence n1 (most difficult level).</p>
<p>I also have a friend who is a program coordinator for the Tokyo International Film Festival, fluent in English, and she gladly decided to do the translation for this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Important materials in this site</h2>
<p>What's most important for this website are the visual materials such as animations and illustrations. I am trying to create a website that is not a typical educational website consisting texts, but something that is enjoyable for everyone.<br/>Each one of the materials is high-quality, entertaining, and enthralling.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479316397/amijpoxnagyrdblryyof.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each page is divided by categories, and there is wonderful pictures or illustrations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479277123/dgotxswjq7q4bb6vsitw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>For each of the 450 words, the page includes  at least one of the following: photos, videos, animations, illustrations or manga. We will choose the most appropriate material for each word.  For example; ""Soyo-Soyo"", a word that describes the wind softly blowing, is explained with the .gif illustration below:</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/y4elLNK.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> <p>A manga is used when the materials can be explained more easily with a story:</p>

<br/>What We Need</h2>
<p>I do have a financial issue since I am basically the only one working on this website. I want my vision for the quality level to become a reality. This website will not be as valuable without a high level of quality, and acquiring it requires that I pay the creators and artists and that I invest in filming equipment.<br/><br/>For example,let's examine how much it costs to make a hand-drawn animation. I inquired at some of the major studios in Japan, and discovered that it costs about $1,000 ~ $2,000 for a 10 second animation. I researched online and contacted freelancers, explaining to them the concept of this project and the level of payment I could provide. They are very talented and highly skilled Japanese animators and they promised to work with me for about $300 per clip for this website.</p>

<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yS2UGrwnD7Y?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>The total sum for the animation materials, which covers about 70 words, is 70x$300=$21,000.</p>
</div>
</div></div>
<p>At the same time, I am raising funds for translators and supervisors, sound recorders, actors, illustrators and manga artists, also all very important.</p>
<p>I will need to spend a sufficient amount of time and money for the creators who are going to work with me, to avoid having any mistakes in the dictionary and to create an exciting language learning tool like none that has ever existed before.</p>

<p>For only 500 yen (about $5) a month, you can achieve a better understanding of the deeper meaning of Japanese words and their nuances.<br/>Many of the onomatopoeia have similar meanings and it's important to know how each of them are used differently in daily conversations. <br/>Also, some words sound similar but have completely different meanings. We will prepare special pages that are designed to describe the meanings and explain the contexts of these words. Furthermore, I have a plan to create pages to introduce Japanese gourmet spots, culture, traditions, festivals, and characteristics of specific regions in Japan.</p>

<p>People who want to speak Japanese, who are interested in the Japanese culture, who<br/>love Japanese food, who want to find a Japanese friend, who interested in Japanese traditions, manners and customs.<br/>People who love Japanese manga and anime.<br/>People, who do not know much about Japan, but are curious to learn more.<br/>People who are fascinated by language and linguistics and want to learn more about this very unique and beautiful aspect of Japanese language.</p>
<p>I hope that this website will help to enhance and deepen your interests and fascination for Japan.<br/>In the near future, interactions as well as business transactions between people of different cultures and races will become even more important. I decided to create this website in the hope of making such interactions more joyful.</p>
<p>This website is also introduced some food and culture, which are uniquely Japanese, such as a great ramen place, a dye house, a rice field, etc.<br/>​I hope that even more people will have the chance to discover how wonderful Japan is.</p>
<p>Wishing that this will be a fun and <i>waku-waku</i> learning experience for you!</p>

<h2>Release date and completion date</h2>
<p>Production for animation clips will start soon after the crowd-funding is complete in February 2017. We will spend the two following  months translating, creating the membership page, shooting and working on the materials.</p>
<p>I will work carefully on each one of them and have around 100 ~ 150 words up on the website. I will add new materials online every 2 to 3 months and plan to have all 450 words up by 2018. And I am planning to have this website in as many languages as possible by Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p>

Mimetic words are divided into three kinds: showing the condition of non-living things, such as ""glittering""/""きらきら(kira-kira)"" and ""slippery""/""つるつる(tsuru-tsuru)"", showing the condition of living things, such as ""groggy""/""ふらふら(fura-fura)"" and ""loitering""/""のろのろ(noro-noro)"", and showing human feelings, such as ""impatiently""/""いらいら(ira-ira)"" and ""excitedly""/""わくわく(waku-waku)"" .
 

About this site
This is teaching material that goes beyond words that never existed before. Most of its features are free and for those who want to get deeper into the world of onomatopoeia, a membership page is available to you for only 500 yen/month.
Japanese people learn these imitative words, mimetic word, and echoic words together with their senses as they grow up. These words are very much rooted in Japanese customs, culture, tradition, and aesthetics, as well as senses. Therefore, once you are able to understand the nuances and grasp the image of these expressions, I am sure you will find your Japanese enriched in various ways.  Furthermore, these words should enable you to get to know us, the Japanese people, better.
 
 
Trustworthiness of the teaching materials
There were two essential tasks for this project.①How do I correctly understand the meanings of Japanese onomatopoeias?You might have noticed I am not an expert in linguistics, and it would dangerous to use only my own understanding. I considered using online resources, but I don't have access to the rights of online dictionaries. I decided to contact Meiji University's Professor Masahiro Ono, who has published Japan's largest onomatopoeia dictionary, with 4500 entries.
I presented him with this project and he decided to let me use his data, which later became the foundation for my website. But 4500 words is too extensive and some of these words are outdated, so I  narrowed the scope down to the  450 most important, commonly used words.

 
②Who is going to translate the material?At first, I met Tokyo Metropolitan University's Professor Jiro Nishigori, who does research in Onomatopoeia and creates websites for non-Japanese speakers himself. He was fascinated by the sample of my website, and introduced me to two alumni of Edith Cowen University in Australia who have Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPY) competence n1 (most difficult level).
I also have a friend who is a program coordinator for the Tokyo International Film Festival, fluent in English, and she gladly decided to do the translation for this project.
 
 
Important materials in this site
What's most important for this website are the visual materials such as animations and illustrations. I am trying to create a website that is not a typical educational website consisting texts, but something that is enjoyable for everyone.Each one of the materials is high-quality, entertaining, and enthralling.

Each page is divided by categories, and there is wonderful pictures or illustrations.


For each of the 450 words, the page includes  at least one of the following: photos, videos, animations, illustrations or manga. We will choose the most appropriate material for each word.  For example; ""Soyo-Soyo"", a word that describes the wind softly blowing, is explained with the .gif illustration below:
 A manga is used when the materials can be explained more easily with a story:
""Biku-Biku""

""Assari""

""Ukkari""

 

What We Need
I do have a financial issue since I am basically the only one working on this website. I want my vision for the quality level to become a reality. This website will not be as valuable without a high level of quality, and acquiring it requires that I pay the creators and artists and that I invest in filming equipment.For example,let's examine how much it costs to make a hand-drawn animation. I inquired at some of the major studios in Japan, and discovered that it costs about $1,000 ~ $2,000 for a 10 second animation. I researched online and contacted freelancers, explaining to them the concept of this project and the level of payment I could provide. They are very talented and highly skilled Japanese animators and they promised to work with me for about $300 per clip for this website.




The total sum for the animation materials, which covers about 70 words, is 70x$300=$21,000.


At the same time, I am raising funds for translators and supervisors, sound recorders, actors, illustrators and manga artists, also all very important.
I will need to spend a sufficient amount of time and money for the creators who are going to work with me, to avoid having any mistakes in the dictionary and to create an exciting language learning tool like none that has ever existed before.
 

About a membership page.

For only 500 yen (about $5) a month, you can achieve a better understanding of the deeper meaning of Japanese words and their nuances.Many of the onomatopoeia have similar meanings and it's important to know how each of them are used differently in daily conversations. Also, some words sound similar but have completely different meanings. We will prepare special pages that are designed to describe the meanings and explain the contexts of these words. Furthermore, I have a plan to create pages to introduce Japanese gourmet spots, culture, traditions, festivals, and characteristics of specific regions in Japan.


 
 

 
Enjoy Japan!
My dream is to help some very special people:​
People who want to speak Japanese, who are interested in the Japanese culture, wholove Japanese food, who want to find a Japanese friend, who interested in Japanese traditions, manners and customs.People who love Japanese manga and anime.People, who do not know much about Japan, but are curious to learn more.People who are fascinated by language and linguistics and want to learn more about this very unique and beautiful aspect of Japanese language.
I hope that this website will help to enhance and deepen your interests and fascination for Japan.In the near future, interactions as well as business transactions between people of different cultures and races will become even more important. I decided to create this website in the hope of making such interactions more joyful.
This website is also introduced some food and culture, which are uniquely Japanese, such as a great ramen place, a dye house, a rice field, etc.​I hope that even more people will have the chance to discover how wonderful Japan is.
Wishing that this will be a fun and waku-waku learning experience for you!
 
 


Release date and completion date
Production for animation clips will start soon after the crowd-funding is complete in February 2017. We will spend the two following  months translating, creating the membership page, shooting and working on the materials.
I will work carefully on each one of them and have around 100 ~ 150 words up on the website. I will add new materials online every 2 to 3 months and plan to have all 450 words up by 2018. And I am planning to have this website in as many languages as possible by Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
 

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help

Please share this on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube pages. The more people who know about this project, the closer we get to achieving our goal.
And that's all there is to it.

Sheiks and shebas! Dishes and dames!After two decades of
providing humdinger writing camps for kids, teenagers, and now alumni and adults, YouthWrite is celebrating its Roaring 20th
birthday and we want you to be a
part of it!
What Is YouthWrite®? 


“[YouthWrite] has been the catalyst for
many changes in my life, [helping] me to find my voice.” - Candice Benson,
YouthWrite alumna



YouthWrite® is a camp for kids who love to write... just about anything!©
And not just one, but a whole smorgasbord: 



The YouthWrite Winter Wordplay weekend camp, at the end of each January in
Edmonton.


Drawn to Write—a three-day camp for Grades 4–9—in
partnership with Happy Harbor Comics each summer.


Our week-long YouthWrite Summer Camps happen each July,
the first for teens aged 14-19, the second for children aged 11–14, in Bragg Creek and
Edmonton, respectively.


JustWrite, a summer writing camp designed specifically for alumni and adults.


Courses
are designed to provide students many ways to work with words— including songwriting, illustration, screenwriting, journalism, storytelling, fiction
writing, poetry, and many more, via instruction from writers, guest
presenters, supervisors and volunteers, who gather from across Canada. Campers also participate in a variety of
arts, leadership and community-building activities.
Our
goals are simple.


To
foster a thoughtful and literate society for future generations.
To
provide a safe haven for youth, including those from minority or low-income populations.
To encourage
young writers to consider the possibilities of the written word.

To continue to welcome participants from a variety of backgrounds and increase diversity and inclusion in all our programs.

To
facilitate a camp that focuses on ""process"" rather than a “product.” 

We also strive to make the camp
accessible to young writers of limited financial means, through the help of
sponsors, writing contests, and scholarships.


This is where you come in!
YouthWrite has been operating a whopping TWENTY YEARS and we couldn't be happier! Now's the time for celebration, for us to reflect on
where we’ve come from as well as where we’re going.
The truth is YouthWrite® would not be possible without the generous
support of our donors (both corporate and individual), alumni, past instructors,
supervisors, and other generous community members. 
So, we’re looking to you to
help us raise some heavy sugar by donating a few of your hard-earned simoleons
to this insanely good cause! 
What We Need & What You Get

“What
I discovered during my week ... was something completely different. I found
myself in an environment where self-expression was encouraged, ideas were never
wrong, and passion for the arts was something to be admired.” - Heather André, YouthWrite alumna


Many of our past campers, instructors and supervisors will tell you YouthWrite is an incredibly special place. However, putting on a writing camp takes a whole lotta clams, bones, fivers and dough. Any
funds raised during this campaign are going directly towards making future YouthWrite
programming happen. This includes:



Providing
materials for classes (paper, pens, pencils, paints, clay, musical instruments, gumboots, laptops, etc.)
Helping
us publicize the camp to students, teachers and parents all over Alberta.
Paying
instructor, supervisor, and/or co-ordinator salaries.
Facility
rentals.
And
more!

For $600, you can send a kid to camp. Seriously $600 is all it takes to dramatically change a kid's summer and possibly life!

You may be wondering, ""Is my donation tax-deductible?"" YouthWrite Society of Canada is a registered charity, so for any donation of $40 or more, the answer is yes!


As a thank you for your generosity, we’re offering a variety of perks, including pins, books, plush figurines of our mascot Inkling, one-of-a-kind custom t-shirts, and more, allowing you to wear your YouthWrite pride in style.

We do almost everything ourselves and are working around the clock sometimes 12 hrs a day rain or shine. Another issue is the films as they are not yet produced. We have about 90% of the video and audio we want to use and are working with a storyboard.

Over the years we studied ecological architecture and permaculture design in order to bring you the best quality education in acroecology and natural construction.Baza Ulmu is a unique permaculture design school where people from all around the world come and learn natural building, no till gardening, food forests and much more useful information following the key permaculture design principles. We are here to give you the right tools and neccessary skills to create your abundant landscape and/or eco-house with all the facilities in order improve the quality of life for you and your family.Andrei is a designer and passionate eco-builder who teaches natural building. From concept to implementation, anything is possible within reason. Lucian can walk you through our no dig, productive food systems and tell you things you never knew about the magic in the plant kingdom. Roxi has translated permaculture books and helped with the immigration situation from Africa.We are dedicated to things that really matter!Baza Ulmu was created to inspire people of all ages. An international project developed by its co-founders and people from all around the world have helped make this dream come true and now we can say it's time to turn this into a public educational space. We bring in permaculture designers and architects as well as eco-builders for courses to teach people how to start their own projects, build their houses or grow their food in a sustainable way. Sometimes entire classrooms of children come here with their teachers and we don't have the necessary facilities to accommodate them. This campaign will help create the right learning conditions for people of all ages and will give an example for other educational projects.We want to dedicate ourselves full-time to this project that can go on for decades. Together we can make a world class permaculture center where people can learn the importance of where their food comes from, agroecology systems, passive solar houses, alternative energy and much more. Everything we've done so far was through our own effort and honest earned money which is quite limited (minimum wage in Romania is 220 euro/month).Together we can produce valuable video content for everyone! “ Come to this place and get to learn some permaculture, some natural building techniques / It’s lovely place in the middle of nature. / With very involved very motivated knowledgeble pleople sharing what they learned in the past years with you”.                                       TUDOR Petrutiu - Romanian Permaculture AssociationWhat if there was a place like a Hobbit land in the middle of nature where you could come and learn everything you wanted to know about eco-building about permaculture, agroecology, passive solar houses, rocket stoves, plants and animals, growing your own food or sustainability?What if you could learn all this through online courses made specially for your needs, both from a classroom environment and directly from the field when we go to clients for consultancy.What if there was also a glamping resort wher you could come and get hosted?What about a space designed especially for children where adults and children alike could come and learn thru play and non formal education?In order for you to fully enjoy our educational center we need to build a classroom for the courses, develop the glamping resort for good accommodation, make a communal kitchen and dinning space and built showers. This would make it fit for an educational trip and a summer retreat vacation.This picture represents ""poster A""“The aim is to teach people how to acomplish these things because now everybody is living in the city and it’s very hard for them to learn these skills, these practical skills. /Using a chainsaw chopping some wood, maybe climbing on a ladder, everything. / What type of wood is a certain tree when you see it, how to use it in a bio-construction.”                                               Lupse Andrei - designer and co-counder of Baza Ulmu“I think it’s better to give Idea as soon as possible to the young people, Mr Clint - Tell you the truth. like this they are not contaminated with all they can see all the common things we can see in real life like a big big building and wood and bitumen. / So educate them, I think it’s always a question of education./ For all things, all that go bad, I think that education can change it.”                                                    Ludo  - Ermitaj Malin (the first permaculture center in Romania)This picture represents ""wallpaper A""It was an amazing experience creating BAZA ULMU, but we are a small team and we can’t do everything on our own. That’s why we ask your help so we can improve the quality of our corses and to build all the facilities needed in order to bring more people in and to make sure that everyone takes home a wealth of information as well as an amazing experience!  With 10.000 USD we can build a classroom with all the necessary equipment and accommodation for overnight stay for 24 people. The cost of the classroom + equipment is 4000 USDThe cost of accommodation huts is 1000 USD/hut x 6 can host 4 people/hutWith 15000USD we could finish the main house, build the classroom, huts and plant our entire food forest and make a new film.With 20000USD we could have all of the above plus off the grid electricity and the ability to invest in a business that can generate our income so that we can become financially independent.  From the target of our first campaign we managed to raise approximately $4000Check out our previous campaignThis should provide us a good start to begin works for the classroom. So far we managed to put forward the necessary papers for creating Baza Ulmu Association, currently an ongoing process. With your help we can do more, we can make applied ecology accessible to everyone.The fact that we reached almost 40% of our initial goal which was $10000 made us set the goal of this campaign at $6000 which will account for the rest of our initial target. Many people are continuously writing about getting the films, courses or other perks which is another reason for our relaunch.What if you could learn to design natural integrated systems that produce healthy and abundant food indefinitely?You could meet a lot of people who have the same mindset about ecology.You could have some hands on experience and practice some skills which they could never do in a classic city classroom.You could learn how to use some tools like different hand tools and start getting building start to get designing…Finding solutions for building your home with natural materials and techniques can be difficult.So is designing a food production system… It’s amazing how many people design and build their houses without considering their health, esthetics or ergonomics.By choosing the right kind of materials and techniques and learning how to design these natural buildings you could not only save a lot of money but also have a farm where you feel in a holiday year round.Here you could learn how to use different tools for building, gardening and designing that will help you develop and implement your own plan.This picture represents ""postcard A""“We offer a variety of couses including whole system design, starfing your own farm, leisure center or building your own house with all the neccesary facilities.”                                                                      Lupse Lucian - co-founder/media directorWhat I find really really great at Baza Ulmu is that they-re organising a lot of courses, summer courses, a lot of workshops. / This is quite amazing because this way you can reach a lot of people.                                                                  Catalin Savin - FEAST Theatre, FEAST Fest   “At our countryside we have another place and it went also as well, almost as well as here and it’s all perfect / We’re starting to grow mushrooms now, and it’s gonna be a promising year for us. / Permaculture should be the Future”                                                                                  Stefan Veronescu - permaculture studentThis picture represents ""poster B""We carefully take every step of our way in order to provide you with two valuable films you can enjoy and get a lot of good information out of.Film 1 - Baza Ulmu - the journey beginsThis film is about our project, how it started up until this very moment. It includes specific information about our design and how everything is interconnected eg: the water from the roof is collected with no visible piping and goes passively into the garden which doesn't need any additional water year round. How we've built our permanent raised beds and how we manage themTools we use, food forest strategiesReal designs for real clients that we break down with youFrequently asked questions and moreFilm 2  - Bio-construction - how toThis picture represents ""wallpaper B""This film, you guessed it, is about natural building. It includes specific information about earth friendly materials and how to design and build a lasting and beautiful house, but also annexes such as: root cellar, terrace, solar shower, rocket mass heaters, rocket stoves, living roofs and more.Subjects followed in the film:  What is bio-construction? How to design from scratch or upgrade your home. What you want vs what you need. Maximising resources. Passive solar houses. Different building techniques and materials: Superadobe, cordwood, living roofs, cob, thatch, wood, rocket mass heaters, Discussions on designs we made for different clients and situations. Frequently asked questions and many more.Andrei studied design and ecological architecture and is working with architects and engineers to provide projects for others. Lucian studied film making to make all this possible, video is a powerful educational tool and with your help we can make more content in the future.We've put together a variety of perks to include everyone's possibilities, whether you're a fan or future eco-builder/permaculture designer there is something for everybody.     If we don't reach our entire goal we will focus on building the classroom and perhaps one or two accommodation huts but it's going to take us a very long time without your help perhaps years. And the films have already entered the production stage so they will be done within our established time frame.You can be a part of this journey by helping this campaign to reach it’s goal!  What would you do to help bringing this kind of project to life?Would you contribute with your donation to bring this kind of place one step closer to reality?Where almost there it just needs an little extra help from the public who supports this kind of actions. It just needs a little more investment to bring this project to a whole new level.This picture represents ""postcard B""With your help, we can create an educational space which you and your friends, as well as thousands of other people will enjoy later on by attending our classes. Children need to take part in non formal education as well as ecological education as soon as possible. The outdoors and fresh air as well as healthy food combined with dynamic activities is a winning situation in which kids could learn about the importance of where their food comes from and how to play in an Earth safe environment.Our project has already gained a lot of media attention and was featured in many newspapers, articles online and tv programmes:We are always invited for talks in the country and abroad and are active members in the Romanian Permaculture Association. Starting February we will finish the necessary paperwork to create Baza Ulmu Association. Risks & ChallengesWe will do our very best to finish our entire design of our education centre in a timely manner however it's pretty hard to find skilled workers that are able to stay for a couple of months (commuting is impractical every day because we are 20 km from the city in a mountaneous area). We do almost everything ourselves and are working around the clock sometimes 12 hrs a day rain or shine. Another issue is the films as they are not yet produced. We have about 90% of the video and audio we want to use and are working with a storyboard. However this is the first time we take on such a demanding challenge of completing two films in a matter of months in a 3 people team. Lucian spent around 500 euro only for ALL of the filming equipment including the post production software so cost isn't really an issue. Almost all our footage has been filmed and edited with this equipment.  We are very optimistic! We’ve  put together an amazing group of collaborators and partnersHundreds of volunteers have helped and learned in this center in 5 years!Now this is where you come in: we are so close of bringing BAZA ULMU SCHOOL to life but we need your support to help complete this project so we can share this knowledge to the world!Please share our Indiegogo campain on the link bellow,and donate as much as you can in order to help this project come to life!Meet the team!    Lucian LupseAndrei LupseRoxana Lupse THANK YOU!       THANK YOU!       THANK YOU! * I really like this crowdsourcing because this is where people can direct their money into things they really like / So I think it’s an honest way to get some funding while other conventional funding systems like EU funds or what not funds, they’re very strict, rigid, they have pretentions. / They don’t neccesarily support a vision while many individuals can help support a vision.""                                                             Tudor Petrutiu -  Romanian Permaculture AssociationOther Ways You Can HelpSpread the word on all social media platforms Talk to your friends and family about our projectYou can use the Indiegogo share tools!Follow our journey to keep in touch with new contentMake a difference one step at a time",20.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<p>Welcome to the Brigitte &amp; Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation (BBSCF), a nonprofit organization with operations in the cities of Accra and Ada in Ghana, West Africa. Our mission  is to create tomorrow's leaders through education and music. Since our start in 2011, we have built a 5 acre youth center called the Musical Village and currently provide 30 students ages 5 - 15 with a high quality education and music program.  </p>
<p>When we talk about our work, we do not talk about ending the cycle of poverty,   Instead, we talk about starting the <b>cycle of success</b>. Our goal for 2015 is to start the cycle of success for 10 more students, and we need your help. </p>

Who We Are 

BBSCF has two core beliefs that drive everything we do:
1. We believe that education is the path to a productive, fulfilling life 
2. Music has the power to connect, inspire and heal  
The life experiences of our founders, Brigitte Poublon and Bobby Sherman, truly demonstrate these beliefs. Brigitte used education to lift herself out of poverty and embark on a successful career. Bobby, a popular recording artist in the 1960s and 1970s, personally witnessed the power of music to transform his life and that of his fans.  
But why Ghana? Ghana has vast natural resources and a rich cultural heritage, particularly in music. But almost one-third of its citizens live below the international poverty line.  Education beyond primary school is not attainable for over 60% of its children.
In Ghana we have found partners who share our vision, ranging from national ministries and local authorities, to tribal chiefs and parents. There are many motivated but underprivileged students with a passion for learning and a will to succeed.


The Musical Village
The heart of our program in Ghana is our youth center, the Musical Village. It is located in Ada, a seaside town about 70 miles from Accra, the capital of Ghana. The Musical Village has 5 buildings:  a classroom, dormitory, kitchen, administration building and a pavilion where we hold events and performances. It opened in July 2013 and was constructed with funds from donors in the United States. It is the site of after school tutoring and music lessons for 25 students. We also hold overnight and holiday camps for our students at the Musical Village.

Most importantly, our students' confidence is increasing and their natural curiosity has been ignited. They want to be the first in their families to attend college and become leaders in their communities.  
Our Next Phase
Thanks to three years of continued success, we have created a meaningful and inspirational program with a team who can superbly execute it.  With the completion of the Musical Village and our enrollment at 30 students, we are ready to expand.  
We will begin the process of recruiting 10 new students in April 2015.  Prospective new students and their parents will complete an application, provide report cards, and submit reference letters.  They will meet with BBSCF teachers and tour the Musical Village.  Admission decisions will be finalized by July 2015, and students will begin attending tutoring and music lessons at the Musical Village in August 2015.

<h2>A small program doing great things</h2>
<p></p>
<p>ALSO has been active in the Ottawa community for over 30 years. We provide upgrading programs in both English and American Sign Language (ASL) to people who are struggling with the essential skills many of us take for granted. We are a safe and caring community learning centre that supports the development of the skills needed for work, further education and family life. </p>
<p>In addition to our adult literacy programs, we offer family literacy support to low income families. Family literacy has had a terrific impact on literacy programming, as it recognizes the need to support parents in order for them to better support their children. </p>Life could be easier for a lot of adults in our community if they had had better opportunities to develop their reading and writing as children. <p></p>
<h2>Why we need your help</h2>
<p></p>
<p>One of our key family literacy programs is the Reading and Parents Program (RAPP), an outreach initiative promoting family literacy activities for low-income families. The key element of RAPP is the RAPP pack, a fun and educational family literacy toolkit for parents and children 0 to 6 years old.</p>
<p>A typical RAPP pack includes a book for every child in the family, as well as crafts, poetry, and reading and language tips for parents.</p>
<p>We also offer two other RAPP versions: one to support parents learning English as their second language – ALSOvoices RAPP; and the other for hearing parents of deaf or hard of hearing children – the American Sign Language (ASL) RAPP.</p>
<p>The ALSOvoices RAPP pack includes an additional audio component, while the ASL RAPP pack includes a DVD.</p>RAPP has already had a positive impact on the families in our community. We work with over 150 families each year.  <b>In order to continue to grow our program resources and continue offering free programming for families, we need your support!</b><p></p>
<h2>Where the money will go</h2>
<p>The funds that we are raising will go to help develop more packs so that we can bring this important resource to more families. Each pack costs on average $25 for the English literacy pack, $30 for the ALSOvoices pack and $40 for the ASL literacy pack. </p>
<p><b>We would like to develop at least 30 new packs for each version of RAPP to share with the community.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Working together</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Our Reading and Parents Program (RAPP) partners with other community organizations to build the skills of parents so they are better able to support their children and create a positive learning environment at home.</p>
<p>The amazing community organizations we work with on the RAPP program are:  the Vanier Community Service Centre, Rideau Rockliffe Community Centre, Heartwood House, Lowertown Community Centre, Overbrook Forbes Community Centre, Infant Hearing Program, Hands &amp; Voices Ottawa, York Street School and the Ottawa Inuit Children’s Centre.</p>
<p>Staff and volunteers visit RAPP satellite sites in the community every two weeks, where they collect the old packs from families and provide new packs. This way we are able to re-use the books and only have to replace the activity materials.</p>
<p><b>By supporting RAPP, you will be joining a community of people and organizations dedicated to making a lasting impact. </b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Family literacy is important</h2>
<p>The family is a child’s first teacher. Current research shows that early experiences help to determine brain structure which in turn shapes the way we learn, think, behave and respond to challenges as adults. The skills and capacity to learn that we develop before the age of six stay with us for a lifetime. Family literacy activities are the foundation of future learning and can help children develop and maintain a love of learning. </p>
<p>We know that families in our society, and especially families living in poverty, are under increasing stress and need all the support they can get. When their children have an opportunity to learn at home, in community programs and even in designated family literacy programs, they have a much better chance of succeeding at school and anticipating a bright, productive future. </p>
<p>Families with deaf or hard of hearing children need support and resources to allow them to develop a strong system for family communication. Having a common language base enables parents to better understand their children. It helps children to express their wants, needs, experiences and dreams to their parents. It means that families can function as a family.</p>
<p>We hope that one day there will be far fewer adults who face a daily struggle with literacy. Join us in making this a reality! </p>

<h3><strong><span style=""color: #0070c0;"">About Our Campaign</span></strong></h3>
<p>In the UK over 50% of children in fee-paying schools learn a musical instrument. In non-fee-paying schools 85% of children say they would really like the opportunity to learn an instrument but the reality is that <strong>only 10% of families can afford the fees</strong>. </p>
<p>Not only is this a terrible waste of potential, but it’s really unfair that a child who has enthusiasm and wants to develop a life-enhancing skill is prevented from doing so because of circumstances outside of their control.  It is even more frustrating when there are so many reports evidencing the much wider benefits that come with learning a musical instrument. </p>
<p>At the Mayor’s Music Fund we’re doing something about musical inequality by awarding 4-year scholarships to children (mostly aged 9 &amp;10) from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds who show masses of ability and a keenness to learn, but need that all-important leg-up to make it happen.  We’d love you to join us in our mission, and our scholars on their musical journey. </p>

A Real-life Example:
Charlie’s Story
Eighteen months ago, Charlie was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. For as long as Charlie can remember, music has been his comfort and constant companion. At nine he had some lessons through the Government’s Wider Opportunities Programme, which promises that all primary school pupils have the opportunity to try an instrument. Charlie took up the cello, and quickly became one of the strongest players in the class.

In December 2011, Charlie, became one of the first Mayor’s Music Scholars. When asked how his cello makes him feel: ‘It’s an emotional feeling.

<p><strong>My name is Amanda Buckmister and I am just a few months away from potentially embarking on the journey of Graduate School!

<p><strong>I have put my &lt;3 and soul into creative education</strong> working with non-profits such as ‘The International Friendship Program’, tutoring and mentoring a variety of college-aged international students in business, academic, and conversational English &amp; the St. James ESL program to advocate justice for refugees and immigrants through education, advocacy, and English language programs. I have collaborated with Peace Corps volunteers to develop cross-cultural orientations, strategic curriculum plans, and connections to community resources in the greater Seattle area. I also worked as an off-site one-on-one English language tutor offering instruction based on U.S. History and current events to aid students for citizenship testing and basic computer instruction to improve foundational skills and resume writing.</p>
<p>Together with my volunteer experience, I continued my education with a series of second language acquisition, ESL methodology, and practical classroom management classes. <strong> I recently completed my intensive TEFL/TESOL certification program</strong> in San Jose, Costa Rica where I lived and studied for two months.  </p>
<p>Looking to expand my bilingual and immersion teaching techniques outside of the formal classroom, I applied to a Japanese and Spanish before and after school program based out of John Stanford International Elementary School.<strong> I have now been employed as a lead  3<sup>rd</sup> grade teacher at Latona School Associates (LSA) for the last three years.</strong> LSA is a Washington state non-profit corporation that respects and fosters the whole child in experimental learning and developmental growth in a culturally inclusive manner -it also happens to be my second home.</p>
<p>Although my work environment at LSA initially inspired me to participate in English teaching programs abroad in Japan (JET), my fellow co-worker, a former JET now enrolled in the <strong>Masters In Teaching program at Seattle University, encouraged me to look into the professional development opportunities offered at a graduate level. Being the first female in my family to graduate from college and the only member to seek an advanced degree, I had apprehensions about taking on more student loans to invest in further education.</strong> Nevertheless, after researching Seattle University’s Student Development program I was instantly assured given I share the same cornerstone values about creative education. </p>
<p><strong>I’ve seen countless quotes from university presidents and leaders that state there is no great education without an international dimension</strong>, and I would have to agree. I strongly believe that international education and exchange not only bridge diplomatic relationships between different countries and peoples, but allows necessary introspection onto one’s self and culture. If leaders, entrepreneurs, and teachers can plant the seed of international exchange, the importance of international education will extend the classroom and the individual blossoming into mutual respect and understanding of humanity regardless of differences.</p>
<p>I have played many roles in my career development: teacher, mentor, educator, leadership coordinator, tutor, friend, and student but my overarching goal is unwavering-to lead, teach, and learn outside of the formal classroom. I continue to seek and thrive in classrooms, workspaces, and environments that foster student diversity and respect the holistic person and that is why I believe I am a ideal candidate for Seattle University’s Student Administration program. </p>
<p><strong>Continuing onto my Master's would fulfill my perpetual yearning to aid transitioning international students, empower adult and secondary learners in job development and self- confidence, bridge cultural populations, and positively impact my global community.</strong></p>

</li></ul><p></p><p>Thank you soooooooo much!</p></div>","The NeedFresno, California is a diverse area where over 100 different languages are spoken.  The 2010 US Census reported that 42.16% of the population spoke a language other than English at home, and 46% listed themselves as, ""not speaking English very well"".  While there are many free English language classes in Fresno, the need for a private language school that provides quality, individualized instruction is extreme.  I want to open an English as a Second Language (ESL) school for adults in Fresno to help meet this need.  I have taught ESL and Special Education in the public school setting.  I possess all the credentials required by the State of California to teach Adult ESL.  I myself am a second language learner, (Spanish), so I understand the difficulties involved in learning another language.  I believe that the free programs offered are incomplete in what they do - it is difficult to do the ""hands-on"", personalized teaching needed to really learn a subject well if you have 35 to 50 students in your classroom.  Central Valley Language School will limit each class to a maximum of 12 students and will offer private lessons as well.  Lessons will be customized to student needs, rather than following a scripted lesson plan.Starting a business is always a challenge, but beginning a school from nothing is really difficult.  Students need books and materials from the first day; they can't wait until the school makes enough to buy them or to rent a place to teach in.  Classes need to be advertised, so that the learners will know that they exist.  I need your help to jump start my school - to buy materials, to advertise, and to pay rent for at least 6 months until the school starts making enough money to support itself.
What We Need & What You Get
I estimate that I will need about $25,000 to run the school until it begins to support itself.  This would cover advertising, books and materials, and rent for the first 6 months of operation.  I have set an opening deadline of May 5th, so I will need to have things ordered by then.  If the $25,000 goal is not reached, then I won't be able to advertise as much and will have to rely more on word of mouth, which could delay school growth.  If the goal is surpassed, I will funnel the additional support into scholarships for deserving students and additional materials.To thank you for your generous help, I have chosen some cool perks to choose from.  Some are serious, and some are silly, but all are designed to reward your thoughtfulness.The ImpactI feel that Central Valley Language School will impact the local community in a significant manner.  Fresno is an economically disadvantaged area, where there are not many entry-level jobs available.  A better grasp of the English language is necessary for legal immigrants to move up in society and to be more productive in it.  Having a local private language school will provide an additional avenue for hardworking individuals who want to invest in their futuresI know that I can accomplish my goal with your help.  I have the experience and the knowledge, I just need a little help with the initial funding.Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:Please help to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.  Share this campaign on your favorite social media site.  Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>Since my graduation from Middle East Technical University (one of the best universities in Turkey), Department of Industrial Design I've always dreamed to have a chance to study in the capital of Industrial Design - Milan. Eventualy, I've attended a competition hold by one of the most famous design schools in the world and won a first prize.</p>
<p>Being a designer and try to make the world better through my sincere designs was the main goal while choosing this profession and if I'd have a chance to study at this marvelous Master Degree Program supported by the most well known design companies and famous designers of the world, I'd be able to perfect my skills as a designer and make a greater contribution to the world's well being. </p>

<p>My program begins in February and  I don’t have enough money to cover tuition and living expenses. The total tuition fee is 32,355 dolars (23,790 euros). The first prize was %70 of total tuition fee. So, now I have to pay 9,700 dolars (7,137 euros). In addition living in Milan is also very expensive min 1,600 dolars per month. Normally the funding needed is much more than I've asked for, but the aim for asking for less is to make it more reasonable and at least this will cover the tuition fee+ the first few months of living there.

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:  I do not have much time for the enrollment fee date (a few days and I've already postponed the date). If I'd miss it, the whole campaign would be meaningless.

Scholarship funds are are very limited this year and we, as judges, feel compelled to raise additional funds for scholarships to inspire and encourage future scientists and engineers. What We Need & What You GetI am hoping to raise at least $500 with all proceeds going directly to the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair scholarship fund through CEHA. We hope that these scholarships will show high school students that we believe in them enough to invest in their futures as scientists and engineers and the future of our field.   Other Ways You Can HelpIf you feel as passionate as we do about helping young scientists, The Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair still needs volunteers to help setup, judge, and work the event.

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal;"">Hey guys!  My name is Avery.  I'm a junior studying psychology at the George Washington University, and I'm spending a semester abroad at The University of Cape Town in Cape town, South Africa with a service-learning program.  As part of the program, I am volunteering at Manenberg Primary School, an elementary school in one of the most dangerous townships in Cape Town.  </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Manenberg is a township that is plagued by poverty, gangsterism, HIV/ADIS, unemployment, drugs, and violence.  The consequences of these issues not only have an effect on the individuals participating in the activities, but also on the children of the community that attend Manenberg Primary.  It is my sincere hope to raise the funds to not only renovate the current eating space in the school, but also to help create a sustainable vegetable garden which will supplement the meager feeding scheme already in place.</p>
<p>There are about 640 students in the school.  The government is only able to provide about 150 school meals.  As such, the 150 meals have to be stretched to feed 640 hungry children.  For most of the students, this fraction of a meal is the only thing they have to eat all day.  The current space in which the children eat is an old classroom that has not been updated since the school's founding in 1969- the flooring is peeling off, the paint is chipping off the walls, everything is covered in chalk and dust, and the furniture in the room is dilapidated.  These children need a safe, clean and healthy environment in which to eat!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order to fully complete this project, we need $2,000 at a minimum.  In the cafeteria, we are looking to put in a new floor, paint the walls, make new curtains to hang over the windows (thanks for all your wonderful help with this already, Grammy!), and hang some educational posters regarding subjects like nutrition and hygiene.  For the garden, we need supplies such as seeds, fertilizer, and gardening tools.</p>
<p>Any contribution will help- the dollar can accomplish more than you might think! $15 can buy a can of vibrant, colorful paint (we decided on using primary colors!) that will light up the cafeteria and make the atmosphere more inviting. $10 can purchase several seed packets, which could help to provide the children of the school with essential vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p>If we (unfortunately) don't reach our fundraising goal- don't worry! The existing funds will still go toward making a difference in the school, just not as big of a difference.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By investing in this school project, you are investing in the future of South Africa because aren't today's children tomorrow's future? Your contribution will make a world of a difference to these children.  These are eager, excited, strong, resilient children who, despite the odds, make it to school every day in an attempt to get a better education than their parents received.  They need proper nutrition and a bright, happy place to eat in order to flourish and fully reach their potential! </p>

Richardson Foundation (JFRF) join forces to send a group of inter-professional students and faculty to Nicaragua to provide health-related services to Nicaraguan older adults. This year there are four occupational therapy students, Julia, Teresa, Katy, &amp; Eva, along with pharmacy, physician assistant, and master of healthcare administration students, going to Nicaragua to improve the quality of life of the elderly citizens there.</p>
<p>The program is designed to assist abandoned older adults living in care homes funded by charitable organizations. The homes, ""hogares"" in Spanish, house older adults who can no longer care for themselves and do not have family to care for them.</p>
<p>Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western hemisphere, forcing many young people to find work in other countries, leaving behind their elder family members. </p>
<p>Here's a little more information about each of the OT students:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Julia Naumes</b> is a second year occupational therapy student who hopes to specialize in elder-care issues and neurological conditions. This service-learning trip will give her valuable information on how typical aging can affect a person's physical and mental well-being, as well as how it changes the individual's role and family dynamics. She is passionate about providing for those in need and believes that her time volunteering in Nicaragua will enable her to have a better appreciation for the US healthcare system, her family, and her education. She also feels blessed to have this interprofessional experience, as it will make her a better practitioner in the future, who knows the scope of practice and abilities of other healthcare professionals. </li>
<li>
<b>Teresa Wright </b>is a second year occupational therapy student who is drawn to facilitate adults and older adults with neurological conditions to live fulfilling lives. After majoring in Spanish and finding her passion for engaging people in meaningful activities, Teresa is eager to merge her two passions in this service-learning project. She is particularly enthusiastic about Nicaragua as this is more than a ""trip""; it is an opportunity to facilitate sustainable change for the population of chronically underserved older adults. Teresa believes this service-learning project will challenge and strengthen her, both personally and professionally. She is honored to have been selected to participate in this experience and is grateful for the other students who also sought out this opportunity to invest in something bigger than themselves.</li>
<li>
<b>Katy Danforth </b>is a second year occupational therapy student whose passion is helping adults with neurological conditions rediscover what they love to do. With a undergraduate background in Biology, Spanish, and Neuroscience, it only seemed natural to continue on the path to Nicaragua. Katy was interested in the Nicaragua program before she even was accepted to Pacific. She loves the sustainable mission of the program and the population it serves. Her favorite quote to describe her personal mission statement is as follows: <i>Not all of us can do great things, but we can all do small things with great love</i>. -St. Therese of Lisieux. This trip is dedicated to her dear friend Katie Chale, who passed away in September and dedicated her life to service, particularly those in Latin America.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Eva Zajac</b> is a third year occupational therapy student
     whose passion is to support the health and well-being of underserved
     populations across the lifespan. She has a background in psychology and has worked with individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds nationally as well as internationally. Eva
     is interested in community-based interventions in health promotion,
     and is excited to serve the elders in Nicaragua.<b> 

</b>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The goal of this fundraising project is to raise at least $3,200 to go towards our airfare, immunizations, accommodations, and insurance. As graduate students, we have limited personal funds to contribute and need all the help we can get. The money raised here goes back to covering the direct costs of our participation in the project and providing wonderful services to the people at the ""hogar"".</p>
<p>As a thank you to those who graciously donate $20.00 towards our trip, we will send a personalized postcard from Nicaragua with a gorgeous photo and details about our trip. See the other Perks we are offering, including post-cards, coffee, and cigars!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In 2007, the first trip to Nicaragua with both organizations (Pacific &amp; JFRF) was initiated. Together, we have established long-term interventions and have advanced sustainable healthcare within the means of the local economy of Nicaragua. This is extremely important because of the poverty levels and lack of education in Nicaragua. Our volunteer work makes a difference in the quality of life of not only the people living in the ""hogares"", but also the caregivers and surrounding community. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>Please spread the word about our campaign. Even if you do not have funds to contribute, you can help by spreading the word about our campaign. </p>
<p>We also need materials donated to lead group activities and provide for the basic needs of the people at the ""hogar"". Older adults in Nicaragua experience the long-term effects of aging, poverty, and a lifetime of poor healthcare. They do not have ready access to common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, basic hygiene and self-care products. Older adults in the hogar also lack access to productive and leisure pastime activities. Items we need donated include:</p>

</div></div>","Our Nicaragua Project! Hi everyone! Each year, Pacific University and the Jessie F. Richardson Foundation (JFRF) join forces to send a group of inter-professional students and faculty to Nicaragua to provide health-related services to Nicaraguan older adults. This year there are four occupational therapy students, Julia, Teresa, Katy, & Eva, along with pharmacy, physician assistant, and master of healthcare administration students, going to Nicaragua to improve the quality of life of the elderly citizens there.
The program is designed to assist abandoned older adults living in care homes funded by charitable organizations. The homes, ""hogares"" in Spanish, house older adults who can no longer care for themselves and do not have family to care for them.
Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western hemisphere, forcing many young people to find work in other countries, leaving behind their elder family members. 
Here's a little more information about each of the OT students: 

Julia Naumes is a second year occupational therapy student who hopes to specialize in elder-care issues and neurological conditions. This service-learning trip will give her valuable information on how typical aging can affect a person's physical and mental well-being, as well as how it changes the individual's role and family dynamics. She is passionate about providing for those in need and believes that her time volunteering in Nicaragua will enable her to have a better appreciation for the US healthcare system, her family, and her education. She also feels blessed to have this interprofessional experience, as it will make her a better practitioner in the future, who knows the scope of practice and abilities of other healthcare professionals. 

Teresa Wright is a second year occupational therapy student who is drawn to facilitate adults and older adults with neurological conditions to live fulfilling lives. After majoring in Spanish and finding her passion for engaging people in meaningful activities, Teresa is eager to merge her two passions in this service-learning project. She is particularly enthusiastic about Nicaragua as this is more than a ""trip""; it is an opportunity to facilitate sustainable change for the population of chronically underserved older adults. Teresa believes this service-learning project will challenge and strengthen her, both personally and professionally. She is honored to have been selected to participate in this experience and is grateful for the other students who also sought out this opportunity to invest in something bigger than themselves.

Katy Danforth is a second year occupational therapy student whose passion is helping adults with neurological conditions rediscover what they love to do. With a undergraduate background in Biology, Spanish, and Neuroscience, it only seemed natural to continue on the path to Nicaragua. Katy was interested in the Nicaragua program before she even was accepted to Pacific. She loves the sustainable mission of the program and the population it serves. Her favorite quote to describe her personal mission statement is as follows: Not all of us can do great things, but we can all do small things with great love. -St. Therese of Lisieux. This trip is dedicated to her dear friend Katie Chale, who passed away in September and dedicated her life to service, particularly those in Latin America.  


Eva Zajac is a third year occupational therapy student
     whose passion is to support the health and well-being of underserved
     populations across the lifespan. She has a background in psychology and has worked with individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds nationally as well as internationally. Eva
     is interested in community-based interventions in health promotion,
     and is excited to serve the elders in Nicaragua. 




  What We Need & What You Get 
The goal of this fundraising project is to raise at least $3,200 to go towards our airfare, immunizations, accommodations, and insurance. As graduate students, we have limited personal funds to contribute and need all the help we can get. The money raised here goes back to covering the direct costs of our participation in the project and providing wonderful services to the people at the ""hogar"".
As a thank you to those who graciously donate $20.00 towards our trip, we will send a personalized postcard from Nicaragua with a gorgeous photo and details about our trip. See the other Perks we are offering, including post-cards, coffee, and cigars!
  The Impact In 2007, the first trip to Nicaragua with both organizations (Pacific & JFRF) was initiated. Together, we have established long-term interventions and have advanced sustainable healthcare within the means of the local economy of Nicaragua. This is extremely important because of the poverty levels and lack of education in Nicaragua. Our volunteer work makes a difference in the quality of life of not only the people living in the ""hogares"", but also the caregivers and surrounding community. 

  Other Ways You Can Help 
Please spread the word about our campaign. Even if you do not have funds to contribute, you can help by spreading the word about our campaign. 
We also need materials donated to lead group activities and provide for the basic needs of the people at the ""hogar"". Older adults in Nicaragua experience the long-term effects of aging, poverty, and a lifetime of poor healthcare. They do not have ready access to common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, basic hygiene and self-care products. Older adults in the hogar also lack access to productive and leisure pastime activities. Items we need donated include:


Shampoo & Conditioner
Soap
Toothpaste
Pampers (or any brand of baby wipes)
Depends (or any incontinence guards) 

Games


Mittens, Scarfs & Hats

Construction Paper
Blank Christmas Cards 
Fabric scraps
Fleece fabric
Adaptive equipment

In the case of Red Hook, Brooklyn, a dedicated core of volunteers took on the full gamut of relief: distribution of resources, allocating clean up and construction crews, and advocating for ongoing needs. Through the march of time, this core consolidated into what is now formally called the RED HOOK VOLUNTEERS. We at Red Hook Volunteers (RHV) are still working within the framework of giving relief to our community for free. Even with our small staff, we have had great success at fostering support for our efforts. Yet while we have been able get funding for our ongoing programs, little money is granted for administration costs, namely, rent. </p> <ul>
<li>RHV is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization. We facilitated over 4,000 volunteers within the first <i>14 days</i><b>.</b> Since then we have coordinated over 7,000 volunteers into the community.

We try to connect our neighborhood in more ways than one.

<b>Our Story &amp; Why You Should Support Us

</b><p>Founded in 2009, Canine Assisted Therapy, Inc. (C.A.T.) is the premier
volunteer pet therapy organization in South Florida, currently with 125
certified pet therapy teams.  C.A.T.’s mission is to provide support,
training, education, and mentoring to those interested in volunteer dog therapy
programs in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties and builds connections
between volunteers and facilities. C.A.T. has received national and
international inquiries on how to establish a similar program. </p>
<p>The organization is unique and different than other pet therapy
organizations in that it requires Level 2 background checks for the handlers,
provides a mentoring program to new volunteer teams, offers pet therapy
preparation classes and mandates an additional evaluation to work with
children.</p>
<p>C.A.T. has provided pet therapy programs and formed partnerships with
organizations such as Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County School Districts;
SafePlace; Ann Storck Center; Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital; Family Central;
Veterans Hospitals in Sunrise and West Palm Beach; Kids in Distress; Broward
Guardian ad Litem; 17<sup>th</sup> Judicial District; Ronald McDonald Houses in
Miami and Ft. Lauderdale; Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida and Equine Assisted
Therapies of South Florida, Inc.</p>

</ul><ul>
<li>Dogs in the

<ul><li>Helps children traumatized by an event and calms them
      for testimony in a courtroom or other similar setting.  The teams

<li>Pack Reader
     Program: </li>
<ul>
<li>Helps students achieve grade level reading including
      those learning English as a second language or children with self-esteem
      issues.  The reading-challenged children in the program often view
      reading as a chore. But dogs don’t judge, so reading to them removes
      inhibitions and helps a child focus. It makes reading fun and creates a
      positive, memorable experience that stays with children for a long time. </li>

Our Story & Why You Should Support Us

Founded in 2009, Canine Assisted Therapy, Inc. (C.A.T.) is the premier
volunteer pet therapy organization in South Florida, currently with 125
certified pet therapy teams.  C.A.T.’s mission is to provide support,
training, education, and mentoring to those interested in volunteer dog therapy
programs in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties and builds connections
between volunteers and facilities. C.A.T. has received national and
international inquiries on how to establish a similar program. 
The organization is unique and different than other pet therapy
organizations in that it requires Level 2 background checks for the handlers,
provides a mentoring program to new volunteer teams, offers pet therapy
preparation classes and mandates an additional evaluation to work with
children.
C.A.T. has provided pet therapy programs and formed partnerships with
organizations such as Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County School Districts;
SafePlace; Ann Storck Center; Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital; Family Central;
Veterans Hospitals in Sunrise and West Palm Beach; Kids in Distress; Broward
Guardian ad Litem; 17th Judicial District; Ronald McDonald Houses in
Miami and Ft. Lauderdale; Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida and Equine Assisted
Therapies of South Florida, Inc.
The following is a brief overview of C.A.T. programs:      
                     
                    
         

Dogs Healing
     Hearts: 

Teams work with veterans, and other adults with
      psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic stress, schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorders, and children and adults in grief counseling. 
Teams assist physical, occupational and speech
      therapists when working with individuals on the autism spectrum, cerebral
      palsy, traumatic brain injury, and other physical rehab issues. 


Dogs in the
     Judicial System: 
Helps children traumatized by an event and calms them
      for testimony in a courtroom or other similar setting.  The teams
      working in this capacity need very specialized training. 

Pack Reader
     Program: 

Helps students achieve grade level reading including
      those learning English as a second language or children with self-esteem
      issues.  The reading-challenged children in the program often view
      reading as a chore. But dogs don’t judge, so reading to them removes
      inhibitions and helps a child focus. It makes reading fun and creates a
      positive, memorable experience that stays with children for a long time. 
Animal Assisted Activities (AAA) for seniors: 
Helps elderly in assisted care facilities or senior
       care centers relieve loneliness and anxiety by interacting with the
       dogs.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Unfortunately, children living with untreated clubfoot face incredible
hurdles their whole lives. Often they are shunned from society – left alone and hidden
away because the family is ashamed. Because walking is so difficult, they are usually unable to attend school. These children
are subjected to much higher risk of neglect, poverty, physical and sexual abuse.  They might end up begging and facing a life of discrimination and pain.

<b>How does it work?</b>
</div><div>Unlike so many of the world’s problems, this one is solvable – and surprisingly inexpensive. miraclefeet supports local health practitioners in developing countries who are trained in the Ponseti method, a non-surgical treatment that involves a series of simple, properly applied plaster casts that are changed weekly. In 95% of cases, this results in full correction of the foot in four to six weeks of casting. Following casting, a brace is worn at night for several years to prevent relapse.  <b>The total cost of treatment? Only $250 per child. It’s a small price to pay to transform a child’s life.</b><br/><br/><b>The innovation.</b>
</div><div>
<p>The miraclefeet brace is a low-cost ($20) foot abduction brace developed at the Stanford d.school through the Design for Extreme Affordability course, in collaboration with miraclefeet, Clarks Shoes and Suncast, to treat clubfoot using the non-surgical Ponseti method. Brace compliance is the most important variable in achieving a good treatment outcome: corrected feet and the ability to walk, run and play as any child should be able to. </p>
<p>This brace was designed specifically for low resource settings with children and their parents in mind. The brace was designed to be tamper-proof and easy-to-use, simplifying the daily bracing struggle that caregivers endure so as to improve compliance rates in the  treatment process. The lightweight, child-friendly design includes easy-on, easy-off accessibility through detachable shoes and built-in stability for standing and walking. Using plastic injection-molding manufacturing methods to keep costs low, our brace is easily scalable for distribution in low-resource countries and we are about to start that process. </p>
<p>Bracing has been one of the biggest hurdles in scaling up Ponseti treatment globally.  Having an off-the-shelf, inexpensive foot abduction brace keeps the cost of treatment low. This will significantly increase the chance that governments and hospitals will make proper treatment available for the 160,000 children born each year in developing countries who are currently at risk of a life of pain, marginalization, abuse and poverty because of untreated clubfoot. <b>Over a ten-year period, this brace could enable as many as 1.6 million children to live active  and productive lives for a relatively small investment. </b></p>
<p>The Ponseti timeline below shows the importance of the bracing phase over the 4-5 year treatment, which typically lasts from seven weeks to four-years-old:</p>

</p><p>Founded in 2008 by educators Gillian Barclay-Smith and Edith Bailey, The Barclay School is a nonprofit, year round K-12 school primarily offering educational services to children with learning differences. These differences include dyslexia, dysgraphia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, and other diagnosed learning differences. The primary mission of the school is to provide a rich, diverse curriculum in a safe, nurturing environment for children in the Columbia, South Carolina area. The Barclay school is also the home of ‘Bunnies’ Brew’,  “nature’s best organic fertilizer,” manufactured by the children of the school.</p>

<p>Over the past year, we as a school have grown to the point where we are running out of space! We began looking into expansion and into adding another building but then we realized we had the chance to do something special, building and using the state's first state-permitted, all-natural building. We began looking further into to see how possible it was and eventually found a dynamic architect with a passion for natural building, a structural engineer, and a contractor.  Their work convinced the City of Columbia to provide the first permit for a rammed earth building in our state.  (Rammed earth was used locally in the mid 19th century.) The Richland County Conservation Commission even gave us a grant for $22,000 to get our project rolling. (THANK YOU County Commissioners and County Council for support of an innovative project!)  All signs are now go, all we need now is the rest of the funds for the project to begin!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The total remainder of funds needed to complete the building is about $20,000. This money will ensure that once the we break ground that the building will be completed on schedule.

Our Adopt A Vet Program allows you and your family to develop a special bond with one of our veterans currently enrolled in our reintegration programs. Make a lasting change in a veteran's life by helping provide safe & stable housing, nutrition and health services, counseling, workforce development programs and life-skills training.We are asking YOU to help us continue to offer these fundamental programs to our veteran population.  We Can't Do It Alone.Because we currently receive no funding from the government, we depend on the generosity of our community to help us cover the costs to provide the housing and services required to change the lives of veterans and their families.

Our Adopt A Vet Program allows you to develop a relationship with an individual veteran and be there for their milestones in recovery and reintegration back into the Metro-Atlanta community. With your support, you are helping transform the lives and hearts of veterans in our great city.



1 in 4 homeless individuals has served as an American Veteran. Now is the time to take action and change the lives of the veterans in our community.

<br/><p><b>WHY EARLY LITERACY SKILLS MATTER</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>A child’s early literacy skills—such as vocabulary size,
letter recognition, and understanding of letter sounds—are consistent
predictors of a child’s reading abilities in kindergarten, throughout his or
her schooling, and in life. Yet, 40% of Minnesotan children start kindergarten not fully prepared (Minnesota Department of Education 2012).
At Think Small we strive to close Minnesota’s achievement gap before a child enters school by
working with providers and parents to implement research-supported methods to
ensure healthy development and prepare children for kindergarten. A key part of
this approach is providing educational resources that support essential skills
such as early literacy.</p>

<p><b>WHY BILINGUAL BOOKS?</b></p>
<p>Minnesota
is home to many refugee and immigrant populations. In fact, the Twin Cities
Metropolitan Area has the largest Hmong, Karen, and Somali populations in the
United States. The Karen and Hmong people are ethnic minority groups from East
and Southeast Asia that have immigrated as refugees to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Life
as a New American comes with many challenges, including learning a new
language. Bilingual books ease this transition by presenting English alongside
a child’s primary language in popular children’s books such as <i>The Very
Hungry Caterpillar</i> and <i>My First Words at Home</i>. It can be
difficult to find materials in languages like Karen in Minnesota, so these
books will also serve as a resource to connect these groups to their primary
language.</p>
<p>These books reinforce early
learners’ language skills and prepare them to participate in an English-speaking
classroom—especially important when English is not the primary language spoken
in the home. Parents and providers who are not fluent in English can use these
books to nurture children’s English skills with age appropriate vocabulary and
correct grammar. Additionally, providers and pre-school teachers who speak only
English can use these books to support a child’s cultural and linguistic background. </p>

Then I would arrive at these places accompanied by the Wildcat-X vehicle and make the blessing for you per your specific request and I will also record it for you.I hope I made my point clear and please join me to help children with special needs, helping you to be blessed and to make my dream come true.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>  Why Ethiopia?<br/>
</h2>
<p>In 2012 I was able to take a trip to Ethiopia with my church, Tapestry. I had never been to Africa and didn't really know what to expect. Lions? Elephants? Skinny people that can run real fast? Yeah, I didn't see any of those but what I did see were people in need. On our trip we played with kids, fed kids, provided groceries for families, and put on a few new roofs. But it wasn't enough. So now we're headed back! This time we're going to build a school. </p>
<h2>Why a School?</h2>
<p>72% of school-aged children in Ethiopia do not have access to formal 
education. This is clearly evident by the poverty that can be seen 
throughout the country. In rural Ethiopia there aren't many options for what someone can do with their life. By building a school, we are opening doors and creating options for people to change their lives. We are giving them a chance to get themselves and their families out of the poverty they live in.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h2>Why I need $ 1,500</h2>
<p>Simply put, your donation will help pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>My travel expenses to include airfare, ground travel, and accommodations<br/>
</li>
<li>My translators. On our last trip we built a very close relationship with our translators. Your donation will give them a job for 3 weeks! <br/>
</li>
</ul>The total cost of the trip is $ 2,500. I am only asking for $ 1,500 because I am earning the rest by working extra jobs and overtime. I wouldn't ask you to make a sacrifice unless I am willing to do it also.<br/>
</div> <div> <h2>Fears &amp; Concerns<br/>
</h2>
<ul><li>My wife, Sarah, and I are both making this trip. That's $ 5,000 we have to come up with! If we are not able to reach our goals then only one of us will be able to make the trip. <br/>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I will be staying for 3 weeks while others from the church will come on two separate trips. That's a long time to be away from home and living in a rural area of Ethiopia. </li>
<li>I will be a team leader for our group. To me this means, keeping everyone safe, fed, and as comfortable as possible while also motivated to continue the work, no matter how hard. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>I understand not everyone has extra money. That's ok! If you can't make a monetary donation we can use help here too:<br/><ul>
<li>Pray</li>
<li>Donate supplies - we can use different types of medical supplies but also soccer balls, shoes, and other clothes. Contact me on how to get them to us.<br/>

<p>Merhaba,</p>
<p>Size hem
“Accountability Lab” isimli sosyal sorumluluk kurumunu hem de bu kurumun projelerine sağlamak istediğim katkıyı anlatmak istiyorum.</p>
<p>Accountability Lab,
birçok ödül almış, uluslararası alanda faaliyet gösteren kar amacı gütmeyen bir kuruluştur. (<u><a href=""http://www.accountabilitylab.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.accountabilitylab.org</a></u> ) Dünya üzerinde zorluk yaşayan bazı
ülkelerde yolsuzluk karşıtı ve hesap verilebilirliliği sağlama amacıyla dünya çapında ihtiyaç duyan ülkelerde
etkinlikler düzenlemektedir. Bu etkinliklerde görev alan katılımcılar
etkinliğin düzenlendiği ülkedeki topluma eğitim, danışmanlık, network, yönetim desteği gibi desteklerde bulunmaktadır.</p>
<p>Ödül kazanmış bir sivil toplum kuruluşu olan Accontibility Lab, dünyanın en zor ve
problemli yerlerindeki insanları, yolsuzluğa karşı mücadele ve toplumsal sorumluluk kazandırmak için
kullanabilecekleri etkin ve düşük maliyetli araçları geliştirmek için kurulmuştur. Accontibility Lab, kendi bölgesinde değişim için yaratıcı fikirleri olan ""değişim ajanlarına"" eğitim, yol gösterilmesi, iletişim ağı sağlanması yönetim desteği ve başlangıç için maddi kaynak sağlıyor.</p>
<p>Bu sene de  4 ülkede yolsulsuzluk ve rüşvete karşı bilgilendirme amaçlı ve buna bağlı oluşan açlık, fakirlik ve dışlanmaya yönelik dikkat çekmek için etkinlik
düzenlemektedir. Bu etkinlikler kapsamında katılan kişilerin bu konularda
mesleki ve kişisel birikimlerini ihtiyacı olan toplumlara aktarılması amaçlanmaktadır.</p>
<p>Bu amaca hizmet
eden yeğenim Can Atacık’tan öğrendiğim bu proje, bir insan ve 40 yıllık hukukçu olarak
beni çok heyecanlandırdı ve gelecek için umutlandırdı. Bu projeyi yürüten ve
projeye katılan gençlere destek olmak için ben de gönüllülere katılıyorum.</p>
<p>Accountability Lab

amaçlı etkinliğe katılmaya karar verdim. Ben de çeşitli ülkelerden gelen diğer gönüllü katılımcılarla birlikte bu etkinliğe katılıp, Nepal’li gençlerin yolsuzlukla mücadele
etmek için hazırladıkları projeleri inceleyip, bilgilendirme ve bilinçlerdirme yoluyla
çalışmalarına destek vereceğim. Dünyanın birçok yerinden ve çeşitli mesleklere sahip katılımcılar  bu

As far as I can remember, I've always had the desire to serve others.  This summer I decided to get out there and help.  I reached out to Tropical Organic Farm in El Salvador and asked if I could donate educational supplies to the kids in their school.  They were so excited that I wanted to help.  Since then I have been reaching out to friends and family trying to collect the things they need.</p>
<p>Here's what they requested:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>6th grade to high school books (novels, dictionaries, literarture)</span></li>
<li><span>Art supplies (lots of paint brushes, paints, etc)</span></li>
<li><span>a drill to build a treehouse for the kids</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>I'm still collecting things I need but more importantly I need help to raise money to send all these supplies to them.  Shipping to El Salvador is very costly. It would be devastating to be able to collect all the things they need and not be able to send it them because of shipping.  </span></p>

Women make up more than 50% of the population, but only 5% of all founders are female!
Women are successful! Recent Dow Jones research on Venture Backed Companies in the US found those that were successful had twice the number of women on the founding team.
Perceptions of opportunity and capability strongly link to entrepreneurial activity - that is, ""if you think you will succeed and will be supported, you are more likely to try. In the US and Developed Europe women are 18% less likely to perceive they have the capability to start a business."" Harvard Business Review, June 2013

""About three-quarters of both male and female entrepreneurs start businesses to pursue an opportunity (rather than out of necessity), but men show more positive perceptions about opportunities and their own capabilities, as well as lower fear of failure."" This is despite similar levels of educations and experience. 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)


What is Draper University?

Draper University was founded by Free Spirited Venture Capitalist Tim Draper (Co-Founder and Managing Director of DFJ Venture Fund), aka ""The Riskmaster"", in 2012 to educate young entrepreneurs who want to change the world. We built this school because the world needs more heroes!

We are an unconventional boarding school for young entrepreneurs located in Silicon Valley. We push our students to fail and fail again, to go outside their comfort zone and become better business people and better human beings.

</b></p><p><b><b>Das sind wir:</b></b></p><b>
</b><p><a href=""www.diewunschkiste.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DIE WUNSCHKISTE</a> das sind wir:
Lucia-Maria und Paolo Masini. Als freiberufliche Künstler gründeten
wir 2010 in Berlin die „Wunschkiste – Zirkus-Theater und
Animation für Kinder in Berlin und Brandenburg“. 
</p>
<p>Seither übernehmen wir die
Organisation und die Gestaltung von Kinderfesten aller Art.
Spezialisiert haben wir uns auf den besonderen Zirkusgeburtstag. Als
Nebentätigkeit gestartet, können wir als kleine Familie inzwischen
beinahe von den Einnahmen der Wunschkiste leben. 
</p>
<p><b>Das ist unser Ziel:</b></p>
<p>Unsere jahrelange pädagogische
Erfahrung als Zirkustrainer und pädagogische Hilfskraft in
Kindergärten möchten wir uns nun zu Nutze machen und das Programm
der Wunschkiste endlich erweitern. Denn von Anfang an wollten wir
Kinder und Jugendliche nicht nur tageweise begeistern, sondern ihnen
auch eine wirklich einzigartige Möglichkeit der
Persönlichkeitsentwicklung bei uns bieten. Bisher geben wir
vereinzelt Kurse und Workshops an Schulen und auch Kindergärten. Wir
möchten nun aber noch viel intensiver und regelmäßig in eine
pädagogische Tätigkeit eintauchen. 
</p>
<p>Das neue Ziel der
Wunschkiste ist ein eigener Kinderzirkus: der Zirkus
Wunschikus!<br/><br/>Nach der Geburt unserer Tochter haben wir letztes
Jahr außerhalb von Berlin ein kleines Haus mit großem Grundstück
erworben. Genug freie Fläche ist also schon mal da!<br/>Für einen
Sommerferienworkshop in Berlin können wir in diesem Jahr ein
Zirkuszelt mieten. Auf unserem eigenen Gelände und für die
Sommerferien auf der Festwiese von Melchow, soll jedoch schon in
diesem Sommer ein eigenes Zirkuszelt stehen. Die Kinder sollen auch
hier eine richtige Zirkusatmosphäre erleben können! Dabei brauchen
wir dringend eure Hilfe!!! 
</p>
<p>Denn neben dem organisatorischen Talent
und dem Körpereinsatz um das alles auf die Beine zu stellen, fehlt
uns momentan noch das nötige Geld um das Zirkuszelt und einige
Requisiten bezahlen zu können! 
</p>
<p>Wir hoffen sehr,
dass ihr uns dabei unterstützt unseren Traum von einem eigenen
Kinderzirkus zu verwirklichen!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Das brauchen wir:</b></p>
<p>Für den Kinderzirkus benötigen wir
noch mindestens 6000 Euro. 1000 Euro haben wir zusammen gespart. Die
Fehlende Summe von mindestens 5000 Euro setzt sich wie folgt
zusammen:</p>
<p>Ein Zirkuszelt			3000<br/>3
Lauftonnen			270<br/>Turnmatte			500<br/>Seillaufgerät			900<br/>Kostüme			330<br/><br/>Des
Weiteren fehlt uns eine Musikanlage, eine Weichbodenmatte, ein
Trampolin, Material für die Zuschauerbänke, Material für die
Manegenumrandung, ein Vorhang, Feuerkeulen und und und… je mehr
Geld wir zusammenbekommen, umso detailreicher und atmosphärischer
können wir schon in diesem Jahr unseren Kinderzirkus eröffnen!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Das bekommt ihr:</b></p>
<p>Als Community soll der Kinderzirkus
finanziert werden. Als Community sollt ihr auch etwas in der ganz
persönlichen Begegnung von uns zurückbekommen!! Lasst euch von
unserer bunten Zirkuswelt verzaubern! 
</p>
<p>Wir laden euch ein, gemeinsam, oder
auch in Einzelaktionen unsere Dienstleistung als Zirkuspädagogen in
verschiedenen Variationen zu nutzen. Vom freien Eintritt in eine der
einzigartigen Zirkusvorstellungen, bis hin zum Einzeltraining bei
euch zu Hause, bei uns im Zelt oder sogar einem ganzen
Zirkuswochenende bei uns auf dem Gelände ist hier alles möglich!!
Wir freuen uns auf euch!<br/>Für diejenigen, die nicht in Berlin und
Umgebung leben, bieten wir selbstgestaltete Zirkusmaterialien an,
z.B. als Bastelset oder von uns für euch persönlich hergestellt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Die Auswirkung:</b></p>
<p>Unsere Vision ist es Kinder und
Jugendliche zu begeistern und stark zu machen, damit sie ihre Zukunft
selbstbewusst, sicher und sozial gestalten können. 
</p>
<p>Unser Kinderzirkus soll in erster Linie
Freude machen. Das Können und die individuellen Fähigkeiten der
Kinder und Jugendlichen sind dabei die Ausgangspunkte. 
</p>
<p>Wir führen die Kinder und Jugendlichen
liebevoll an die verschiedenen Zirkusdisziplinen heran und vermitteln
den Kindern einen Freizeitwert, fernab von der heutigen Computer-und
Mediengesellschaft. Durch unser vielfältiges Angebot und durch die
Freude und dem Spaß an der Sache wird spielerisch das soziale
Miteinander gefördert. 
</p>
<p>Die Kinder und Jugendlichen lernen
durch ein kreatives Medium, das sie fasziniert und sie können ohne
Leistungsdruck den eigenen Interessen nachgehen oder verborgene
Fähigkeiten und Talente entdecken. Gerade auch für
leistungsschwache und verhaltensauffällige Kinder und Jugendliche
bietet unser Kinderzirkus so eine Möglichkeit, Bestätigung und
Anerkennung zu bekommen. 
</p>
<p>Das Projekt ist in diesem Sinne auch
als präventive Intervention für Kinder und Jugendliche gedacht,
insbesondere gilt dies für Gewalt- und Drogenprävention. Gezeigt
wird ein gewaltfreier kollektiver Weg der Freizeitgestaltung.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>So könnt ihr außerdem helfen:</b></p>
<p>Wenn ihr kein Geld übrig habt um
unseren Kinderzirkus finanziell zu unterstützen, könnt ihr uns
trotzdem helfen, indem ihr unsere Kampagne online bei Facebook oder
per Mail mit euren Freunden und Bekannten teilt!</p>
<p>Vielen lieben Daaaank!</p>

</p>
<p>The “<a href=""www.diewunschkiste.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wunschkiste</a>”
it’s us: Lucia Maria and Paolo Masini. 2010 we founded as freelance
artists the “Wunschkiste” – circus-theater and entertainment
for children in Berlin and Brandenburg.</p>
<p>Since then we take
over the organization and design of children's party’s of all
kinds. We have specialized to the particular circus birthday. What
started as a secondary activity, now gives enough  work that we, as a
small family, can almost live from the revenues of the “Wunschkiste”.</p>
<p><b>That's our goal: </b>
</p>
<p>Now we want to use
our many years of pedagogical experience as circus coaches and
pedagogical assistant in kindergarten, to finally expand the program
of the “Wunschkiste”. Because it has always been our desire, not
only to inspire children and young people for one day, but also offer
them a truly unique opportunity of personal development with us.
Until now, we give occasional courses and workshops in schools and
kindergartens. Now we want to dive even more intense and regular in a
pedagogical work. The new destination of  ""Wunschkiste"" is
a kid's circus: the circus “Wunschikus”!</p>
<p>After the birth of our
daughter we acquired last year outside of Berlin a small house with
large grounds. So, enough free space is already there! 
</p>
<p>For a Summer
Workshop in Berlin, we hire a circus tent. But on our own site and
for the summer holidays on the meadow in Melchow should be already
this summer a private circus tent. The children should be able to
experience a real circus atmosphere here! We urgently need your help!

</p>
<p>We have a lot of
organizational talent and a lot of power. However, we also need money
to pay for the circus tent. 
</p>
<p>We very much hope that you
will help us to realize our dream of our own children circus!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>That's what we need: </b>
</p>
<p>For the children's circus,
we still need at least 6000 Euro. We have already saved 1000 euros.
The Missing sum of at least 5000 Euro is made up as follows: 
</p>
<p>A circus tent 3000 
</p>
<p>3 bearing balls 270 
</p>
<p>Turn mat 500 
</p>
<p>Rope treadmill 900 
</p>
<p>Costumes 330</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need a
music system, a soft floor mat, trampoline, material for the audience
benches, material for the ring border, a curtain, fire clubs and and
and ... the more money we get together, the more detailed and

Das sind wir:
DIE WUNSCHKISTE das sind wir:
Lucia-Maria und Paolo Masini. Als freiberufliche Künstler gründeten
wir 2010 in Berlin die „Wunschkiste – Zirkus-Theater und
Animation für Kinder in Berlin und Brandenburg“. 

Seither übernehmen wir die
Organisation und die Gestaltung von Kinderfesten aller Art.
Spezialisiert haben wir uns auf den besonderen Zirkusgeburtstag. Als
Nebentätigkeit gestartet, können wir als kleine Familie inzwischen
beinahe von den Einnahmen der Wunschkiste leben. 

Das ist unser Ziel:
Unsere jahrelange pädagogische
Erfahrung als Zirkustrainer und pädagogische Hilfskraft in
Kindergärten möchten wir uns nun zu Nutze machen und das Programm
der Wunschkiste endlich erweitern. Denn von Anfang an wollten wir
Kinder und Jugendliche nicht nur tageweise begeistern, sondern ihnen
auch eine wirklich einzigartige Möglichkeit der
Persönlichkeitsentwicklung bei uns bieten. Bisher geben wir
vereinzelt Kurse und Workshops an Schulen und auch Kindergärten. Wir
möchten nun aber noch viel intensiver und regelmäßig in eine
pädagogische Tätigkeit eintauchen. 

Das neue Ziel der
Wunschkiste ist ein eigener Kinderzirkus: der Zirkus
Wunschikus!Nach der Geburt unserer Tochter haben wir letztes
Jahr außerhalb von Berlin ein kleines Haus mit großem Grundstück
erworben. Genug freie Fläche ist also schon mal da!Für einen
Sommerferienworkshop in Berlin können wir in diesem Jahr ein
Zirkuszelt mieten. Auf unserem eigenen Gelände und für die
Sommerferien auf der Festwiese von Melchow, soll jedoch schon in
diesem Sommer ein eigenes Zirkuszelt stehen. Die Kinder sollen auch
hier eine richtige Zirkusatmosphäre erleben können! Dabei brauchen
wir dringend eure Hilfe!!! 

Denn neben dem organisatorischen Talent
und dem Körpereinsatz um das alles auf die Beine zu stellen, fehlt
uns momentan noch das nötige Geld um das Zirkuszelt und einige
Requisiten bezahlen zu können! 

Wir hoffen sehr,
dass ihr uns dabei unterstützt unseren Traum von einem eigenen
Kinderzirkus zu verwirklichen!!

Das brauchen wir:
Für den Kinderzirkus benötigen wir
noch mindestens 6000 Euro. 1000 Euro haben wir zusammen gespart. Die
Fehlende Summe von mindestens 5000 Euro setzt sich wie folgt
zusammen:
Ein Zirkuszelt			30003
Lauftonnen			270Turnmatte			500Seillaufgerät			900Kostüme			330Des
Weiteren fehlt uns eine Musikanlage, eine Weichbodenmatte, ein
Trampolin, Material für die Zuschauerbänke, Material für die
Manegenumrandung, ein Vorhang, Feuerkeulen und und und… je mehr
Geld wir zusammenbekommen, umso detailreicher und atmosphärischer
können wir schon in diesem Jahr unseren Kinderzirkus eröffnen!!

Das bekommt ihr:
Als Community soll der Kinderzirkus
finanziert werden. Als Community sollt ihr auch etwas in der ganz
persönlichen Begegnung von uns zurückbekommen!! Lasst euch von
unserer bunten Zirkuswelt verzaubern! 

Wir laden euch ein, gemeinsam, oder
auch in Einzelaktionen unsere Dienstleistung als Zirkuspädagogen in
verschiedenen Variationen zu nutzen. Vom freien Eintritt in eine der
einzigartigen Zirkusvorstellungen, bis hin zum Einzeltraining bei
euch zu Hause, bei uns im Zelt oder sogar einem ganzen
Zirkuswochenende bei uns auf dem Gelände ist hier alles möglich!!
Wir freuen uns auf euch!Für diejenigen, die nicht in Berlin und
Umgebung leben, bieten wir selbstgestaltete Zirkusmaterialien an,
z.B. als Bastelset oder von uns für euch persönlich hergestellt.

Die Auswirkung:
Unsere Vision ist es Kinder und
Jugendliche zu begeistern und stark zu machen, damit sie ihre Zukunft
selbstbewusst, sicher und sozial gestalten können. 

Unser Kinderzirkus soll in erster Linie
Freude machen. Das Können und die individuellen Fähigkeiten der
Kinder und Jugendlichen sind dabei die Ausgangspunkte. 

Wir führen die Kinder und Jugendlichen
liebevoll an die verschiedenen Zirkusdisziplinen heran und vermitteln
den Kindern einen Freizeitwert, fernab von der heutigen Computer-und
Mediengesellschaft. Durch unser vielfältiges Angebot und durch die
Freude und dem Spaß an der Sache wird spielerisch das soziale
Miteinander gefördert. 

Die Kinder und Jugendlichen lernen
durch ein kreatives Medium, das sie fasziniert und sie können ohne
Leistungsdruck den eigenen Interessen nachgehen oder verborgene
Fähigkeiten und Talente entdecken. Gerade auch für
leistungsschwache und verhaltensauffällige Kinder und Jugendliche
bietet unser Kinderzirkus so eine Möglichkeit, Bestätigung und
Anerkennung zu bekommen. 

Das Projekt ist in diesem Sinne auch
als präventive Intervention für Kinder und Jugendliche gedacht,
insbesondere gilt dies für Gewalt- und Drogenprävention. Gezeigt
wird ein gewaltfreier kollektiver Weg der Freizeitgestaltung.

So könnt ihr außerdem helfen:
Wenn ihr kein Geld übrig habt um
unseren Kinderzirkus finanziell zu unterstützen, könnt ihr uns
trotzdem helfen, indem ihr unsere Kampagne online bei Facebook oder
per Mail mit euren Freunden und Bekannten teilt!
Vielen lieben Daaaank!
This is us: 

The “Wunschkiste”
it’s us: Lucia Maria and Paolo Masini. 2010 we founded as freelance
artists the “Wunschkiste” – circus-theater and entertainment
for children in Berlin and Brandenburg.
Since then we take
over the organization and design of children's party’s of all
kinds. We have specialized to the particular circus birthday. What
started as a secondary activity, now gives enough  work that we, as a
small family, can almost live from the revenues of the “Wunschkiste”.
That's our goal: 

Now we want to use
our many years of pedagogical experience as circus coaches and
pedagogical assistant in kindergarten, to finally expand the program
of the “Wunschkiste”. Because it has always been our desire, not
only to inspire children and young people for one day, but also offer
them a truly unique opportunity of personal development with us.
Until now, we give occasional courses and workshops in schools and
kindergartens. Now we want to dive even more intense and regular in a
pedagogical work. The new destination of  ""Wunschkiste"" is
a kid's circus: the circus “Wunschikus”!
After the birth of our
daughter we acquired last year outside of Berlin a small house with
large grounds. So, enough free space is already there! 

For a Summer
Workshop in Berlin, we hire a circus tent. But on our own site and
for the summer holidays on the meadow in Melchow should be already
this summer a private circus tent. The children should be able to
experience a real circus atmosphere here! We urgently need your help!


We have a lot of
organizational talent and a lot of power. However, we also need money
to pay for the circus tent. 

We very much hope that you
will help us to realize our dream of our own children circus!

That's what we need: 

For the children's circus,
we still need at least 6000 Euro. We have already saved 1000 euros.
The Missing sum of at least 5000 Euro is made up as follows: 

A circus tent 3000 

3 bearing balls 270 

Turn mat 500 

Rope treadmill 900 

Costumes 330
Furthermore, we need a
music system, a soft floor mat, trampoline, material for the audience
benches, material for the ring border, a curtain, fire clubs and and
and ... the more money we get together, the more detailed and
atmospheric, we can already open this year our children's circus ! 


That you will receive: 

As a community of children
circus is to be financed. As a community, you also will get something
back in the personal encounter between us! Let enchant you of our
colorful circus world!
We invite you to work
together, or to use in individual actions our service as a circus
educators in different variations. From free entry to one of the
unique circus shows, up to one training with you at home, with us in
the tent or even a whole circus weekend with us on the site,
everything is possible here! We look forward to seeing you!

The effect: 

Our vision is to inspire
children and young people and to make them strong so that they can
build their future with confidence, safe and socially. 

Our children's circus is
especially to be fun. The skill and the individual abilities of
children and adolescents are the starting points. 

lovingly we show the
children and young people the various circus disciplines and teach
the children a recreational value far away from today's computer and
media company. Social interaction is promoted by our varied range and

The children and young
people learn through a creative medium that fascinates them. They can
follow their own interests without pressure to perform and discover
hidden skills and talents. Especially for underachieving children,
our children's circus is a way to get confirmation and recognition. 

The project is intended in
this sense, as a preventive intervention for children and
adolescents. This is particularly true for violence and drug
prevention. Shown is a non-violent collective way of recreation.

So you can also help: 

If you have no money left
to support our children's circus financially, you can help us anyway,
by sharing our online campaign on Facebook or via email with
your friends and acquaintances!

</div><h1>What is Farmshare
Austin and Farmer Starter</h1>
<p><b>In 2012, a board of dedicated volunteers created the
nonprofit, <a href=""http://farmshareaustin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farmshare Austin</a>.  Together,
they sought to create an innovative 501(c)3 that could effectively address the
complex issue of food security in the Central Texas area.</b>  As the board looked at the barriers to
achieving such security, one in particular stood out: the lack of education
programs in the region for students wishing to become organic farmers.  Consequently, the board identified new
farmer education as a priority, and Farmer Starter was born.</p>
<p><b>Farmshare Austin’s Farmer Starter program will start October
1, 2014. The program will be a six-month intensive residential course where
students will live and work on an educational farm in eastern Travis County, just
eighteen miles from downtown Austin.</b> Students will learn about the science,
theory, and business of farming while gaining experience working on the
educational farm. The curriculum will be accentuated with workshops that will
cover some of the diverse skills that are needed around a farm like carpentry
and mechanics. The program will also include fieldtrips to area farms so
students can see a variety of growing methods and scales of production.  </p>
<p><b>Produce grown on the farm will be used to support Farmshare
Austin’s food access goals. The Sustainable Food Center’s Happy Kitchen program
will receive produce from Farmshare, and Farmshare students will supply produce
to a weekly farm stand at Sanchez Elementary School in East Austin.</b>  Farmshare will also work with community
non-profit nutrition programs to identify clients for a Community Supported
Agriculture (CSA) program. The food access strategy will help ensure that
Farmshare produce is used by people who may otherwise lack the means to
purchase seasonal organic fruits and vegetables. At the same time, Farmshare
students will gain experience operating three distribution models that are
essential to local farmers—wholesale, farm stands, and a CSA program. The food
access strategy will also put Farmshare students in the community where they
will work with partnering non-profit organizations and serve low-income and
access-challenged people. </p>
<h1>Why Farmer Starter
Matters</h1>
<p>Aspiring farmers without a traditional background in
agriculture have a lot to learn in order to be successful, and Farmer Starter
will give them the foundation necessary to begin realizing their dreams. <b>Farmer
Starter will be one of the first programs of this type in Texas and one of the
only programs in the South and Southwest. </b></p>
<p>Farmer Starter graduates will play a critical role in
Central Texas’ food system. The demand for high-quality local produce is
increasing just as many farmers are nearing retirement. <b>Training the next
generation of vegetable farmers is essential for the health of people in the
region and the businesses that rely on the availability of these products. </b></p>
<p>Finally, the disastrous effect of the standard American diet
is the greatest public health challenge our country currently faces, and, like
so many social problems, the burden is disproportionally borne by disadvantaged
people. <b>Farmer Starter will be one of the only producers growing nutritious
organic food specifically for low-income and access-challenged people in our
community.</b> By serving these people during their education, it is our hope that
Farmer Starter students will, in the course of their agriculture careers,
continue to develop innovative ways to ensure that healthy food is available to
everyone regardless of location or income. </p>
<h1>What Farmer Starter
Needs</h1>
<p>Farmershare Austin needs to raise $50,000 this summer to
complete construction at the educational farm and give our students the best
possible experience when they start this fall. We need: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Six student housing units </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A shared hygiene facility </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A classroom and office space for students and
staff to learn and work</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Supplies to support the food access strategy </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A scholarship fund to help ensure that the most
qualified students can participate in Farmer Starter regardless of resources. </p>
<h1>What You Get</h1>
<p>When you contribute to Farmer Starter you become part an
exclusive group of people who work tirelessly to ensure that Central Texas has
a dynamic, healthy food system for generations to come. The perks for this
campaign, described on the right, are designed to welcome you into this community and express our

<p>Our names are Jared Medeiros and Kelsey Johnson, we have been followers of Jesus Christ for years now. Up until a few months ago, we were very selfish Christians, always looking out for what's best for us and how God can help us get what we want. But God exposed the both of us to what He wants us to do -- reach out and spread His love and Word to people who desperately need it. Once we started down this path of helping others in need, God called us to go on this mission trip to Romania and Serbia through Calvary Chapel Beachside. </p><p>On this mission, we will be working with
Stepping Stone Missions, an organization that works with gypsy families who
live on the outskirts of society in horrible conditions. Up to 12 people will
live in a small, one bedroom shack with no pluming or electricity. They are not
able to work or attend school, which has become a vicious cycle for
generations. Cindy Getchman, the founder of Stepping Stone Missions, came to
Romania to feed these children and has created a program to break this cycle of
poverty. She has been teaching them to read and write, to be respectful, and
most importantly, she is teaching them about Jesus. After working with them for
5 years, Cindy was able to enroll 8 gypsy children into Romanian schools this

<br/></div>","Our names are Jared Medeiros and Kelsey Johnson, we have been followers of Jesus Christ for years now. Up until a few months ago, we were very selfish Christians, always looking out for what's best for us and how God can help us get what we want. But God exposed the both of us to what He wants us to do -- reach out and spread His love and Word to people who desperately need it. Once we started down this path of helping others in need, God called us to go on this mission trip to Romania and Serbia through Calvary Chapel Beachside. On this mission, we will be working with
Stepping Stone Missions, an organization that works with gypsy families who
live on the outskirts of society in horrible conditions. Up to 12 people will
live in a small, one bedroom shack with no pluming or electricity. They are not
able to work or attend school, which has become a vicious cycle for
generations. Cindy Getchman, the founder of Stepping Stone Missions, came to
Romania to feed these children and has created a program to break this cycle of
poverty. She has been teaching them to read and write, to be respectful, and
most importantly, she is teaching them about Jesus. After working with them for
5 years, Cindy was able to enroll 8 gypsy children into Romanian schools this
past year, which is nothing short of a miracle! This September, 10 more will be
enrolled.Even if you don't feel like God is calling you to donate to this cause, please pray for our team as we travel across the world. Prayer changes lives! We really appreciate the support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><i><b>The Nueva Student Trip Fund: At Home Around the World!</b></i></h1>

<p>The alumni currently working at Nueva are excited to launch the<b> Nueva Student Trip
Fund</b>. The Fund offers
alumni and their families an opportunity to remember their time at Nueva and to
give back so others can share in those memories. <span>As soon as preparations for this year’s trips began, we were reminded of
how special our own trips were. As Nueva students, we traveled far and wide –
to our local forests, the Nation’s capital, and even abroad, and – all by the
time</span> we were 13. Even more, we continued to realize the value of these trips once
we had graduated Nueva. <br/></p>
<p>Nueva offered us awesome opportunities to explore.
Now that we are back on campus, we want to encourage others to reengage. We
hope you will be as inspired as we are and consider giving to the Nueva Student
Trip Fund. Check out the video to see what our favorite trips were, and please
share yours in the comments.</p>
<h3><b>What
will the Nueva Student Trip Fund support?</b></h3>
<p></p><p>The
Fund will provide financial assistance for current students with demonstrated
need to cover expenses associated with annual class trips and extracurricular
opportunities. Tuition continues to provide trip support for families on
financial aid. However, there are trip expenses and additional travel
opportunities that are not covered by aid awards.
<span>This initiative will
ensure that every child is able to partake in all the trips beyond the regular
school trips— allowing Model UN students to compete as far as St. Petersburg,
Russia and Futures students to travel to the International Bowl. Every gift will have a marked impact at Nueva,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Limbics combine pressure triggers and lovable plush characters that come to life with touch. They are digital toys that produce sounds and create a subtly different interaction every time they are touched.</p>
<p>At first all sorts of noises come out of limbics but with a constant touch pattern it settles into one sound. Change the pattern of your touch and limbics' voice will randomize again.</p>
<p>Limbics is the brain child of Dr. Nathalie Prevost (Dr. Thalie). The project evolved out of her PhD research in Cognitive Science on language, population dynamics and neural structures... and a love for the fuzzy and the adorable.</p>
<p>While researching language evolution, from the context of baby babble, she noticed the soothing power of delightful little sounds that newborns of most species seem to produce. It soon became obvious that most paedomorphic traits - new born features - elicit expressions of delight and are fundamentally comforting. Limbics is an ongoing research into the potency of the delightful and adorable for soothing and connecting people.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your hard earned money will be used to put on an art show that will promote the limbics brand and perhaps most importantly the healing effects of all things delighful.  The art show will feature ten limbics that people will be able to interact with.  During the show Dr.Thalie will evaluate people's response and establish limbics potential for theraputic use.</p>
<p>To achieve our goal we need $6450 USD.</p>
<p>      - $1500 USD for Arduino reprogrammable circuit boards, Adafruit wavesheilds, Sparkfun breakout circuit boards, conductive thread, and so on, fun fur and of course the eyes.</p>
<p>      - $1500 USD for voice acting</p>
<p>      - $1000 USD for sound production</p>
<p>      - $1200 USD for development</p>
<p>      - $ 500 USD for show production costs</p>
<p>      - $ 300 USD for donor appreciation perks</p>
<p>      - $ 450 USD for campaign processing fees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The limbics project offers tokens of our appreciation for your incredible generosity and interest:</p>
<p>$1 donation: you will recieve 1 limbics wallpaper original art for your mobile phone.</p>
<p>$5 donation: you will receive 3 limbics wallpaper original art for your mobile phone. </p>
<p>$10 donation: you will receive a limited edition 1in button featuring the limbics original art, in addition to the 3 limbics wallpaper.</p>
<p>$25 donation: you will receive a limited edition, giant 4in button that features more original limbics art, in addition to the 1in button and the limbics wallpaper art.</p>
<p>$400 donation: you can have your very own limbics interactive soft sculpture.  One of ten unique handmade specimens, numbered and certified.</p>
<p>Finaly, keep an eye out for the limbics iPhone app Poodidoo, which will soon be available for free on iTunes.  Poodidoo features limbics animated art and is simply meant to make you smile.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dealing with day to day stress can be difficult and tiring and this may be why people love watching cute kittens on You Tube.  While taking a break to watch something that make us feel better is certainly beneficial, having a healthy brain is also about getting our bodies involved.  Touching, in addition to listening and watching is an important part of engaging in the world.  Interacting with a real object that reacts to our touch is also a good way to ground ourselves in reality. Certainly, an adorable little object to interact with can only help to make that reality less intense, as it sometime can be.</p>
<p>As a cognitive scientist and a designer/developer Dr. Thalie has worked on many projects that involve games for brain fitness, training and educational purposes.  Those tools are usually referred to as ""serious"".  While it is serious business and extremely benificial to keep one's ""rational"" brain fit, it is also worth keeping our ""emotional"" brain fit, as well, by involving it in not so serious activities.</p>
<p>We hope that limbics as a project will grow to involve research in the mental health fields, such as psychiatry and psychology and several neuro-sciences.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So if you like our little critters and you think there should be more of them in the world, please spread the word about our project and don't be shy about using Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>many thanks everyone.</p>

<b><i><br/></i></b><div><b><i>""Regarding any input I have about your work to demilitarize public education in Chicago, it has my wholehearted support. We should be teaching our children how to resolve conflicts in a peaceful and constructive way.""      </i>Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Gumbleton</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><div>
<h2><b>What We Are Doing</b></h2>
<div>As militarization spreads across our nation, from police departments to schools to neighborhoods, conflict resolution by violent military means becomes pervasive. Veterans for Peace, an international organization of military veterans and allies, is working to reverse this trend. </div>
<p><i><b>Right now, the Chicago Chapter of Veterans For Peace is pursuing a many-pronged campaign to bring Peace at Home, Peace Abroad by focusing on children and youth and the demilitarization of public education. </b></i></p>
<p>As veterans, we’ve experienced the military from inside, and many of us have fought in one or more of our country’s all-too-frequent wars. Despite the common claims of recruiters, generals, corporate media and politicians, we can tell you that when the military is sent in, they are there to dominate any person or group that is rightly, wrongly or unnecessarily identified as an enemy, and that the military’s core method is violence. </p>
<p><i><b>Domination and violence, and consequently the military, have no place in the lives of children and youth. Our schools should be the bastion for education, not militarization.</b></i></p>
<p>Yet, due to the myths, built up over decades, that the military model is about ""leadership,""  ""discipline"" and ""service,"" and that students perform better in military settings, the military mindset persists in invading public schools.   True leadership, discipline and service can be taught in any environment.   The military model, with its focus on following orders without question, is a detriment to development.  If  students are given opportunities, resources and recognition in <b>any</b> classroom, they will perform better.  Getting the military model out of the Chicago Public Schools can be the start <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to removing the military model from public education nationally. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We seek to build a movement to remove the military model of conflict resolution by violence from the lives of children and youth in Chicago, and to turn Chicago Public Schools into a </span>national<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> showcase for teaching a well-rounded curriculum for all students that includes cooperation, </span>nonviolent<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> conflict resolution skills and restorative justice.</span></i></b><br/></p>
<h2><b>How You Can Help</b></h2>
<div><b></b></div>Right now, we are working to build broad support for our campaign to educate the Chicago area (and the nation) on the necessity to Save Children and Youth from the Military Model.  We are directing our effort to erecting billboards calling for an end to military involvement in our schools, but we may use other means to get the word out and generate dialogue.<div>
<br/><div>
<div>
<b><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Please help bring Peace at Home, Peace Abroad by ending the militarization of public education. Donate </span>generously<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to our education campaign, and spread the word. </span></i></b>

<span style=""font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">Campaign Details</span>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>In the Chicago market, it currently costs about $12,500 to keep one full-size billboard up for one year, and that's how we set our goal. Depending on how our ""Education not Militarization"" drive develops, we may decide to put up more than one billboard for shorter periods or to put up a mix of billboards and digital signs and other media. </div>
<div><b><i>The more generous you can be, the more media we will be able to utilize to educate and generate dialogue in the Chicago area and nationally.</i></b></div>

</div>
<div>If you are unable to donate, you can still help greatly by telling as many people as possible about the militarization of education and our efforts. Post us on Facebook and other social media sites. Send emails about us to your contact lists. Whatever you can think to do to help us raise as much awareness (and money) as we can will be greatly appreciated not only by us, but by all the middle and high school students who together we might save from a militarized ""education"" of conflict resolution by violence. </div>

""Regarding any input I have about your work to demilitarize public education in Chicago, it has my wholehearted support. We should be teaching our children how to resolve conflicts in a peaceful and constructive way.""      Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Gumbleton


What We Are Doing
As militarization spreads across our nation, from police departments to schools to neighborhoods, conflict resolution by violent military means becomes pervasive. Veterans for Peace, an international organization of military veterans and allies, is working to reverse this trend. 
Right now, the Chicago Chapter of Veterans For Peace is pursuing a many-pronged campaign to bring Peace at Home, Peace Abroad by focusing on children and youth and the demilitarization of public education. 
As veterans, we’ve experienced the military from inside, and many of us have fought in one or more of our country’s all-too-frequent wars. Despite the common claims of recruiters, generals, corporate media and politicians, we can tell you that when the military is sent in, they are there to dominate any person or group that is rightly, wrongly or unnecessarily identified as an enemy, and that the military’s core method is violence. 
Domination and violence, and consequently the military, have no place in the lives of children and youth. Our schools should be the bastion for education, not militarization.
Yet, due to the myths, built up over decades, that the military model is about ""leadership,""  ""discipline"" and ""service,"" and that students perform better in military settings, the military mindset persists in invading public schools.   True leadership, discipline and service can be taught in any environment.   The military model, with its focus on following orders without question, is a detriment to development.  If  students are given opportunities, resources and recognition in any classroom, they will perform better.  Getting the military model out of the Chicago Public Schools can be the start to removing the military model from public education nationally. 
We seek to build a movement to remove the military model of conflict resolution by violence from the lives of children and youth in Chicago, and to turn Chicago Public Schools into a national showcase for teaching a well-rounded curriculum for all students that includes cooperation, nonviolent conflict resolution skills and restorative justice.
How You Can Help
Right now, we are working to build broad support for our campaign to educate the Chicago area (and the nation) on the necessity to Save Children and Youth from the Military Model.  We are directing our effort to erecting billboards calling for an end to military involvement in our schools, but we may use other means to get the word out and generate dialogue.


Please help bring Peace at Home, Peace Abroad by ending the militarization of public education. Donate generously to our education campaign, and spread the word. 


Campaign Details



In the Chicago market, it currently costs about $12,500 to keep one full-size billboard up for one year, and that's how we set our goal. Depending on how our ""Education not Militarization"" drive develops, we may decide to put up more than one billboard for shorter periods or to put up a mix of billboards and digital signs and other media. 
The more generous you can be, the more media we will be able to utilize to educate and generate dialogue in the Chicago area and nationally.

How To Help If You Can't Donate

If you are unable to donate, you can still help greatly by telling as many people as possible about the militarization of education and our efforts. Post us on Facebook and other social media sites. Send emails about us to your contact lists. Whatever you can think to do to help us raise as much awareness (and money) as we can will be greatly appreciated not only by us, but by all the middle and high school students who together we might save from a militarized ""education"" of conflict resolution by violence.

family! </p>
<p>We are the Pathfinder
Club sponsored by the SF Samoan SDA Church located in South San Francisco.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Clubs are a non-profit
community service charity organization that offers a wide range of activities
including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Camping &amp; camping/survival skills</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Organizational &amp; disciplinary skills taught through Fancy Drill
Team</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Grade appropriate leadership training</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Activities promoting community pride &amp; involvement through outreach
activities such as passing out food to the homeless, collecting donations for
the disadvantaged, visiting and encouraging the elderly, and MANY more</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Interactive training in a variety of recreational, artistic, nature,
conservation, vocational, and outreach areas, with awards (honors) given for
successful completion of the interactive training modules</p>
<p>Our Pathfinder Club has
been in existence for almost as long as there has been a congregation at that
site, almost 50 years.  This Pathfinder
Club in particular services the inner city areas of San Francisco.  Over 90% of our club is children &amp; youth who
reside in the Hunter’s Point, Sunnydale, Portrero Hill, and Double Rock low
income inner city housing.</p>
<p>Our club is completely
based on donations.  Every staff member
is a volunteer who is paid nothing in return for their time and dedication to
these children.  This is what brings us
to you today.  </p>
<p>Since 1985 every 4
years there is an Worldwide International Camp where clubs from all over the world come
and represent their home areas.  In the
almost 50 years that our club has been in existence we have never been able to
attend, until now.</p>
<p>For the first time our
Pathfinder Club sponsored by the SF Samoan SDA Church will be in attendance at
the Osh Kosh International Camporee where our Drill Team will represent for our
San Francisco area.</p>

We are the Pathfinder
Club sponsored by the SF Samoan SDA Church located in South San Francisco.
Pathfinder Clubs are a non-profit
community service charity organization that offers a wide range of activities
including, but not limited to:
· 
Camping & camping/survival skills
· 
Organizational & disciplinary skills taught through Fancy Drill
Team
· 
Grade appropriate leadership training
· 
Activities promoting community pride & involvement through outreach
activities such as passing out food to the homeless, collecting donations for
the disadvantaged, visiting and encouraging the elderly, and MANY more
· 
Interactive training in a variety of recreational, artistic, nature,
conservation, vocational, and outreach areas, with awards (honors) given for
successful completion of the interactive training modules
Our Pathfinder Club has
been in existence for almost as long as there has been a congregation at that
site, almost 50 years.  This Pathfinder
Club in particular services the inner city areas of San Francisco.  Over 90% of our club is children & youth who
reside in the Hunter’s Point, Sunnydale, Portrero Hill, and Double Rock low
income inner city housing.
Our club is completely
based on donations.  Every staff member
is a volunteer who is paid nothing in return for their time and dedication to
these children.  This is what brings us
to you today.  
Since 1985 every 4
years there is an Worldwide International Camp where clubs from all over the world come
and represent their home areas.  In the
almost 50 years that our club has been in existence we have never been able to
attend, until now.
For the first time our
Pathfinder Club sponsored by the SF Samoan SDA Church will be in attendance at
the Osh Kosh International Camporee where our Drill Team will represent for our
San Francisco area.
We need your help, and
we need it badly.  These children are
more than just themselves, they represent their area, their home, their
families, their church, and they represent the history before them and the
future that is to come.  These kids have
never been outside the confines of their inner city area and now they have the
opportunity to go across country to represent their area, their family, and their pride to a worldwide
audience.
The tickets are paid

</p><div>
<h3></h3>
<p>Gambia is one
of Africa’s smallest and poorest nations ranking 168<sup>th</sup> out of 187
countries in the UN. 48.4% of the population is classified as living in
poverty. Life expectancy is 58 years. Approximately 50% of the population is
under 15 years. 49 out of 1000 children die before reaching the age of 5 years
as compared to between 5 and 9 in the developed world. Malaria is a killer, also
Yellow Fever and <b>DIARRHOEA</b>! Young
children are very susceptible to this particularly when living in unsanitary
conditions.</p>
<p><b>MAIN AIMS SO FAR</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To
provide healthier environments for the children to grow up in</p>
<p><span>·<span>

<p><b>ORIGINS</b></p>
<p>Kotu Kids
charity was established 5 years ago by myself – Jeanette Hodgson – although I
had been helping poor families in the Kotu neighbourhood before that. In 2002,
a 3 year old boy called Didance Jatta
befriended me. One evening I walked him home to his room. I cried when I saw
the conditions the family was living in and that is how it all began.</p>
<p>Never before
had I seen so many people living in such a small space infested by both rats
and mosquitoes. Never before had I seen people sleeping on straw mats directly
onto the ground with no covers. No mosquito protection! Bare mud walls, mud
floors and mostly no furniture, not even chairs or tables or beds. Roofs full of
holes where water pours in during the torrential rains of July, August and
September. Toilets overflowing with excreta, plagued with flies and used to
shower in as well.

</p>
<p>For 2 years I
used any spare cash I had to improve the homes of 2 Gambian families.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/779471/files/20140811035708-africa_2011_023.jpg?1407754628"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>We concreted over mud floors, cement rendered
mud walls, painted, bought sponge mattresses, installed or repaired corrugate
roofs, provided new floor covering (lino). It was all I could afford at the
time until I had the idea to involve family and friends. And that is how Kotu
Kids was born.

<p><b>ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>With

<p><b>£100</b>
will renovate a run- down family home by filling and blocking holes in walls
and floors (most of which have been made by rats entering) painting, installing
new lino floor covering, patching roofs, supplying some basic items of
furniture such as sponge mattresses and often mosquito proof doors or windows,
and carrying out general repairs.</p>
<p><b>£4</b>
will buy one mosquito net.</p>
<p><b>£200</b>
will pay for one new corrugate roof.</p>
<p><b>£250</b>
will significantly subsidise a year’s rent for one family for basic but
reasonably appointed accommodation WITH ELECTRICITY! This makes it possible for
pupils to study at home and do well at school .Most families in this area live
without access to electricity.</p>
<p><b>£900</b>
will pay for the 3 teachers at Erinjang School to be properly trained so that
young children in this deprived area will learn the basics of reading and
writing and mathematics far more effectively than they do at present where
staff clearly struggle with this highly skilled task. Remember, they are
teaching a foreign language (English) which most of the children have very
little opportunity to practice outside school hours. The teachers themselves,
of course, will benefit by commanding better salaries.</p>
<p><b>£100</b>
will pay for 4 teenagers to receive about 32 hours training in computer skills.
There is no access to computers in the government schools in Gambia .</p>
<p><b>£40</b>
will pay school fees, uniform and books for one more child to go to school for
one year</p>
<p><b>£250</b> will pay for a gifted pupil to continue his/her education from the age of 16 to 18 years. This level is optional and not mandatory hence the higher fees. Parents from these backgrounds are not able to afford this so highly intelligent, hard-working pupils mostly find themselves forced to take menial jobs with very little remuneration. Let's help these
gifted pupils continue their education and maybe – even - go to college or
university!

</p>
<p><b>£200</b>
will pay for around 40 people, a mix of adults and children, to be vaccinated
against Yellow Fever (a virus spread through the bite of a particular mosquito)
which is still killing people in the Gambia even though it can be effectively
vaccinated against. There is a free vaccination programme for children under 5
years but many uneducated parents are unaware of their rights and entitlements
or do not have sufficient money to pay for transport to and from the clinic.
Many of the families in Kotu are in grave danger, especially as the area
borders a river so, in the wet season, there are many more mosquitoes than are
found in other, drier areas. Vaccinations cost around £3/4 per person plus
transport to the clinic.</p>
<p><b>£10</b>
will pay for one woman to attend the Family Planning clinic and receive
effective contraception for up to 5 years.</p>

all of my applications back in October, and visiting several campuses 
over the last couple months, I have decided to attend Florida State 
University in Tallahassee to pursue my Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular 
Biology.  Not only does this school offer an amazing academic program 
where I can fulfill my venom research dreams, but they also offer full 
tuition assistance and a (small) living stipend (all of these things are
 actually standard for Ph.D. programs in the sciences as we are not 
allowed to have outside work while in the program).<br/><br/>Though there is a 
stipend from the university, the first year especially will be very 
tight until I am able to apply for additional funding. Also, as part of 
my contract, I am not allowed to have an outside job as I will be 
working full time (or more so) for the university.<br/><br/>So, I need your help (and by help, I mean financial support) to help supplement my income so I can do my best to stay out of debt while pursuing my dreams. I am treating this campaign as a gift registry of sorts. I know this may be a 
foreign idea to most, but I was inspired when I came across an article 
recently which highlighted how we as a society have chosen to celebrate 
some life choices extravagantly (weddings and baby showers, for 
instance) and have not put enough emphasis on our hard-earned 
accomplishments. Graduate 
school is a long-term commitment (5 years on average) and just like entering a marriage and starting a family, a lot of support is needed from friends and family along the way.<br/><br/>With all of the expenses below, I'm anticipating I will need an additional $15,000 to cover my move and first year of extra expenses. However, I have only set the goal for $5,000 in hopes of meeting and surpassing that goal as the % taken by Indiegogo is far more favorable that way. Here are the details of the Perks you can contribute to:<br/><br/>Moving Expenses - We all know this can get real pricey, real fast. In addition to the actual moving, I will have a month of double rent (in Austin and Tallahassee), need to put down all new deposits, and have enough left over to cover the first couple months in Tallahassee as our first stipend checks likely won't be available until October. <br/><br/>Healthy Living - This funding will support a healthy diet and exercise plan for both me and my #1 man, Mr. Sheldon (my dog). We all know these are the first things to fly out the window when studying all the time, but I am determined to keep up with my healthy lifestyle. This funding will also support Sheldon's regular medications and vet visits. <br/><br/>Travel &amp; Leisure - Work Hard. Play Hard. Though there won't be much time for it, I would still love to be able to see all of you as much as I can. This funding will go towards airfare and other expenses associated with visiting friends and family every chance I get. I have a miles card with US Airways/American Airlines, so gifting miles is an option too!  <br/><br/>Expect the Unexpected - Sh*t happens. Like needing a new clutch or tires on your car, dislocating your shoulder, your dog needing emergency care, and rattlesnake bites (the former not being true, yet). Grad School is not generally a time money can be saved, so I'm hoping to have a little cushion in the event of an emergency. <br/><br/>You all have NO idea how much your continued love and support means to me. I would not be the person I am today without you and am eternally grateful. <br/><br/>Much love, <br/><br/>Micaiah <br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><br/></div>","I'm going to Grad School, y'all!

University in Tallahassee to pursue my Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular 
Biology.  Not only does this school offer an amazing academic program 
where I can fulfill my venom research dreams, but they also offer full 
tuition assistance and a (small) living stipend (all of these things are
 actually standard for Ph.D. programs in the sciences as we are not 
allowed to have outside work while in the program).Though there is a 
stipend from the university, the first year especially will be very 
tight until I am able to apply for additional funding. Also, as part of 
my contract, I am not allowed to have an outside job as I will be 
working full time (or more so) for the university.So, I need your help (and by help, I mean financial support) to help supplement my income so I can do my best to stay out of debt while pursuing my dreams. I am treating this campaign as a gift registry of sorts. I know this may be a 
foreign idea to most, but I was inspired when I came across an article 
recently which highlighted how we as a society have chosen to celebrate 
some life choices extravagantly (weddings and baby showers, for 
instance) and have not put enough emphasis on our hard-earned 
accomplishments. Graduate 
school is a long-term commitment (5 years on average) and just like entering a marriage and starting a family, a lot of support is needed from friends and family along the way.With all of the expenses below, I'm anticipating I will need an additional $15,000 to cover my move and first year of extra expenses. However, I have only set the goal for $5,000 in hopes of meeting and surpassing that goal as the % taken by Indiegogo is far more favorable that way. Here are the details of the Perks you can contribute to:Moving Expenses - We all know this can get real pricey, real fast. In addition to the actual moving, I will have a month of double rent (in Austin and Tallahassee), need to put down all new deposits, and have enough left over to cover the first couple months in Tallahassee as our first stipend checks likely won't be available until October. Healthy Living - This funding will support a healthy diet and exercise plan for both me and my #1 man, Mr. Sheldon (my dog). We all know these are the first things to fly out the window when studying all the time, but I am determined to keep up with my healthy lifestyle. This funding will also support Sheldon's regular medications and vet visits. Travel & Leisure - Work Hard. Play Hard. Though there won't be much time for it, I would still love to be able to see all of you as much as I can. This funding will go towards airfare and other expenses associated with visiting friends and family every chance I get. I have a miles card with US Airways/American Airlines, so gifting miles is an option too!  Expect the Unexpected - Sh*t happens. Like needing a new clutch or tires on your car, dislocating your shoulder, your dog needing emergency care, and rattlesnake bites (the former not being true, yet). Grad School is not generally a time money can be saved, so I'm hoping to have a little cushion in the event of an emergency. You all have NO idea how much your continued love and support means to me. I would not be the person I am today without you and am eternally grateful. Much love, Micaiah",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Students at CCSF, San Francisco State (SFSU)
and University of California-Berkeley, are initiating the ""Debt Free
Future"" campaign in California. This campaign is being supported by the
Student Labor Action Project (SLAP) which is a national project and partnership
of Jobs with Justice and the United States Student Association (USSA). <br/><br/>
 The main component of this campaign is to educate students about student
loan debt and organize for more funding from the State for higher education in
California. California is #1 in prison spending and #50 in higher education
spending, the priorities have to change. Student loan debt is in the trillions
in the United States because students have to depend on loans to get through
college. Students are faced with rising tuition, textbook costs and living
expenses. Classrooms are overcrowded and there is a lack of support services
and counselors to help students navigate their classes and be successful. Often
after students get out of college they end up in an unmanageable financial
crisis because of their loans. We seek to educate students and the entire
education community about the impact of student loan debt. We will also lobby
our elected representatives to promote measures for college affordability and
measures that alleviate the burden of student debt.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b>If you contribute to our campaign you
are funding:</b><br/>
-Travel costs for students to reach out to other students across California<br/>
-Materials and Technology: printing, design, website, banners, t-shirts and

-Work stipends for (5) student organizers to conduct outreach and lead

<p>-Empowering students to educate other students and formulate
strategies to improve college affordability in California.
 </p>
<p>-Helping students to unify and build the foundation for a

<p>-Changing the tide of the student debt crisis so that people

<p>-Giving hope to millions of college graduates who are

<p><b>Past Accomplishments</b></p>
<p>SLAP is committed to promoting equity, student and labor
partnerships, social and economic justice and equity. In 2012, National SLAP
launched a campaign aimed at Sallie Mae, the largest profiteer from student
debt. At USSA’s LegCon, SLAP students were key players in leading a 300 plus
student march and protest against the student loan giant, Sallie Mae. The
action resulted in the arrests of 36 students engaged in non-violent civil
disobedience. On April 25th, SLAP held a National Day of Action to raise
awareness that student debt levels had reached $1 trillion. SLAP students
across the country conducted banner drops and collected petitions against Sallie
Mae’s predatory lending practices. </p>
<p>In May 2012, over 200 students and community allies went to
the Sallie Mae shareholders meeting to demand Sallie Mae address concerns over

The chance to create my own film at such a young age is more than I could have ever imagined.

<h2><strong>My Passion </strong></h2>
<p>I am so passionate about film because storytelling is in my blood. Since I was a child, I’ve always been a storyteller. And much of it comes from my family. My grandmother was a writer and my father is a documentary filmmaker and videographer.</p>
<p>I’ve always kept tons of notebooks full of my play, movie and comic ideas since I was very young (see my embarrassing comic book pictures and notebooks here). </p>

<h2><strong>But- WHY Prague? Why now?</strong></h2>
<p>For me, there couldn’t be a better place to start a career in film than Prague. Prague has a unique history rooted in film and cultural expression.

<p>I believe in the power of media for social change and its ability to give communities and individuals a voice.

<p><strong>What is Tolleson New Global Citizens?</strong></p>
<p>The Tolleson New Global Citizens chapter was founded by 3 students in 2010. They were inspired by the book <em>Half the Sky</em>, to make a difference in the world by empowering the youth in their community to take a role in solving many of the problems that plague the world. Tolleson NGC picks a grassroots project in a developing country to raise funds and awareness for. This year, Tolleson NGC is sponsoring A Ban Against Neglect, an organization that helps young mothers in Ghana attain valuable job skills, maternal health, housing, and an education. The mothers collect the 40 tons of trash that end up in the streets of Accra, Ghana and turn it into sellable merchandise, such as hand bags and bracelets. With this, they are able to learn a valuable job skill, clean up the streets of Accra, and stimulate the economy in Ghana. All funds raised by Tolleson NGC go to ABAN to further allow the women to make a difference in their own lives and their entire country.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help</strong></p>
<p>ABAN needs funds in order to keep the health care, school supplies, sewing materials, and other products that allow the young mothers to make an impact. Tolleson NGC hosts education and cultural events to raise awareness and funds for ABAN, allowing them to join the movement in creating change for the lives of these women. You too can become a part of this growing movement! By donating, not only do you help a young mother reach her goals and dreams, you also get merchandise that is hand-made by Tolleson NGC members! Since the basic idea of ABAN is to take recyclable material and repurpose and reuse it to make sellable merchandise, Tolleson NGC has adopted this idea and repurposes products when making merchandise, such as the book marks, which are made out of cereal boxes, and the pencil pouches, which are made out of slightly used fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Our club's impact</strong></p>
<p>Tolleson New Global Citizens has existed for three years now. Since its creation, Tolleson NGC is devoted to making a difference in the lives of people living in impoverished countries by empowering youth to take charge in their communities to raise awareness and funds to the many issues all over the world. This has proven to be very successful, as Tolleson NGC raised $1,500 in its first year for the Afghan Institute of Learning, which provides women in Afghanistan an education and promotes gender equality, and raised $1,400 for the Shelter of Friendship, which provides housing, health care, food, and an education for the children living in the slums of Brazil, and the Malawi Well Repair Project, which gives the people in Malawi access to clean water by repairing the broken wells in the country. The team has educated over a thousand people about the issues confronting developing countries, and many of the Tolleson NGC alumni have gone on to create ripple effects on their college campuses.</p>
<p>Since the true major goal of New Global Citizens is to raise awareness and educate people on the issues in impoverished countries, we ask that you join the movement and help us educate. Please, share our Indiegogo page with your friends on Facebook or Twitter, or share our student-made video as well!</p>

The Tolleson New Global Citizens chapter was founded by 3 students in 2010. They were inspired by the book Half the Sky, to make a difference in the world by empowering the youth in their community to take a role in solving many of the problems that plague the world. Tolleson NGC picks a grassroots project in a developing country to raise funds and awareness for. This year, Tolleson NGC is sponsoring A Ban Against Neglect, an organization that helps young mothers in Ghana attain valuable job skills, maternal health, housing, and an education. The mothers collect the 40 tons of trash that end up in the streets of Accra, Ghana and turn it into sellable merchandise, such as hand bags and bracelets. With this, they are able to learn a valuable job skill, clean up the streets of Accra, and stimulate the economy in Ghana. All funds raised by Tolleson NGC go to ABAN to further allow the women to make a difference in their own lives and their entire country.
Why we need your help
ABAN needs funds in order to keep the health care, school supplies, sewing materials, and other products that allow the young mothers to make an impact. Tolleson NGC hosts education and cultural events to raise awareness and funds for ABAN, allowing them to join the movement in creating change for the lives of these women. You too can become a part of this growing movement! By donating, not only do you help a young mother reach her goals and dreams, you also get merchandise that is hand-made by Tolleson NGC members! Since the basic idea of ABAN is to take recyclable material and repurpose and reuse it to make sellable merchandise, Tolleson NGC has adopted this idea and repurposes products when making merchandise, such as the book marks, which are made out of cereal boxes, and the pencil pouches, which are made out of slightly used fabric.
Our club's impact
Tolleson New Global Citizens has existed for three years now. Since its creation, Tolleson NGC is devoted to making a difference in the lives of people living in impoverished countries by empowering youth to take charge in their communities to raise awareness and funds to the many issues all over the world. This has proven to be very successful, as Tolleson NGC raised $1,500 in its first year for the Afghan Institute of Learning, which provides women in Afghanistan an education and promotes gender equality, and raised $1,400 for the Shelter of Friendship, which provides housing, health care, food, and an education for the children living in the slums of Brazil, and the Malawi Well Repair Project, which gives the people in Malawi access to clean water by repairing the broken wells in the country. The team has educated over a thousand people about the issues confronting developing countries, and many of the Tolleson NGC alumni have gone on to create ripple effects on their college campuses.
Since the true major goal of New Global Citizens is to raise awareness and educate people on the issues in impoverished countries, we ask that you join the movement and help us educate. Please, share our Indiegogo page with your friends on Facebook or Twitter, or share our student-made video as well!

<h3>Le Projet</h3>
<p>L'idée d'offrir des séances de vulgarisation sur l'astronomie germe en moi depuis quelques années. En étudiant la Physique à l'université, je me suis vite rendu compte que l'observation des astres était ma passion. Je m'y consacre dorénavent à temps plein.</p>
<h3>Le concept est simple:</h3>
<p>Quelques heures, à la tombée de la nuit, à faire découvrir la plus belle histoire du monde, la nôtre. Des premières secondes de l'Univers jusqu'à l'apparition de la Vie, j'explique en mots simples toute la complexité de notre monde. Une observation par télescope suit la discussion.</p>
<p>Un très bon moyen d'offrir ces présentations est l'industrie du tourisme. Les voyageurs sont toujours à la recherche d'activités, et l'astronomie en passione plus d'un! Je suis présentement en train de me bâtir un réseau d'auberges et de gîtes sur le territoire du Québec, et l'acceuil est très positif!</p>
<p>Ce projet est pour moi une véritable source d'accomplissement, car il rejoint ma passion pour l'astronomie et la volonté de partager un sujet qui intéresse bien des gens.</p>
<h3>Outils</h3>
<p>Pour pouvoir faire plaisir à un groupe de voyageurs, quelques outils seront nécessaire. Le 2000$ demandé servira en partie à l'achat d'un deuxième télescope. Je dois aussi motoriser le premier, cela facilitera énormément l'observation. Avec l'argent restant, j'acheterais un projecteur qui servira durant ma présentation.</p>
<h3>Contreparties</h3>
<p>Avec un don de 25$, je vous offrirai une présentation dans quelconque endroit où je me trouve, un calendrier de mes déplacements vous sera envoyé.</p>
<p>Avec un don de 75$, j'offrirai à vous et 3 autres personnes de votre choix une présentation dans quelconque endroit où je me trouve. Un calendrier de mes déplacements vous sera envoyé, accompagné d'un cherche-étoiles.</p>
<p>Avec un don de 500$, je me déplacerai à n'importe quel endroit au Québec pour vous offrir une présentation, vous pourrez inviter le nombre de personnes que vous voudrez.</p>
<h3>Éducation</h3>
<p>Je crois sincèrement que ce projet pourra éveiller chez plusieurs personnes une envie de continuer à observer les étoiles. Les jeunes ne sont pas souvent en contact avec l'astronomie à l'école, voila une manière de, peut-être, leurs faire découvrir une passion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Merci de partager et n'oubliez pas de lever la tête vers les étoiles!</p>
