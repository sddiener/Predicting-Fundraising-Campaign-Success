<li>The body loses 70% on average of its heat though the skin</li>
<li>Dry skin is more of a problem in the winter months as there is less moisture in the air.</li>
<li>Whether it is dry skin or keeping warm, prevention is always better than the cure.</li>
<li>When you feel cold your mind struggles to concentrate and focus on the task at hand</li>

<p><b>Where do I apply Coldscreen?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Depending on what level of warmth and protection you desire for the weather  conditions, you can apply it to areas as little as your arms OR to your whole body just like you would a sunscreen. Just remember, it’s not for all of those highly sensitive body areas (YES, you know where we mean.)</span></p>
<br/><p><b>How long does it take to work after application, can I wear clothes over top of it, and will it stain?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">97% of individuals experience the amazing warm feeling within the first 5-15 minutes. After a few applications you will know the perfect amount of time you need to apply before you venture out into the cold. WIthin that 5 minutes, it will be dry and clothing can be put over the top. Coldscreen works extremely well in conjunction with a windbreaker or any other clothing, and will never stain.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Can Coldscreen be used on the face?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have specifically formulated this version for the body and not the face. To get the best experience possible, keep the areas in which Coldscreen is applied away from your face, especially your eyes. If this accidentally occurs, wash off with cool water and soap.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Will this stop or help me from getting hypothermia or other similar conditions?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Coldscreen is designed to improve your overall experience of being completely comfortable and warm in the cold. It is not intended as a substitute for appropriate clothing in harsh environments, and will not prevent/cure hypothermia or cold-related conditions. Please use good judgement for the surroundings you will be going into.</span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Is it water soluble and will it get greasy/oily with sweat?</b></p>
<p>Sweat will not affect the functionality of Coldscreen, nor will it make it oily or greasy. However you can not go deep sea diving as it is not waterproof!. (Watch this space)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Will I overheat if I end up in a warmer environment?</b></p>
<p>Coldscreen was designed so that you can be out in a colder environment but still retain your warmth. If you do happen to go past the backcountry and end up in the desert you can easily wash coldscreen off with cold water and soap.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Will it clog pores or cause any side effects</b></p>
<p>Coldscreen has not ever had any known side effects and is clinically proven to be safe for all skin types. We recommend not using coldscreen if you have any existing skin problems. Sorry! We will be sure to include this in our next formulation.</p>
<br/><p><b>How much do I use?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The amazing thing about Coldscreen is that you only need the same amount as you would a moisturizer. It is possible to achieve a slightly more effective insulation barrier if more is applied, but this is not normally necessary.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>How do I remove Coldscreen?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">All it takes to remove is to wash the applied areas with soap and cool water. Within a few minutes the warm feeling will dissipate. We recommend that if Coldscreen has been recently applied or a prominent warmth feeling is still active, to wash it off before getting into a hot tub or shower, so that you are not uncomfortably hot.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Has it been tested on animals?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This can be as simple as NO. Coldscreen has never and will never be tested on our furry friends. Coldscreen is cruelty-free.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Can I reapply once it has worn off?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Yes, you can. We based the lasting effect on half a day of being on the slopes, but if you just can’t get enough, then just reapply at lunch time and you will be good to go again. For the very best results, wash off existing product first.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Should I wash it off before heading to bed?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For those of you who do not normally venture into the shower after a big day of outside activity in the cold, then we do recommend washing Coldscreen off with cool water and soap before bed. Unless, of course, you are sleeping in a cold environment and want that feeling of your own personal heater right next to you. Camping under the stars anyone?</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Are there any side effects or possible adverse reactions?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Coldscreen has no known undesirable side effects at all and no cases of any adverse reactions. As everyone’s skin is different, please follow the directions and consult your physician if a reaction does occur. We recommend not using Coldscreen if you have any skin-related health conditions.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Can I use it while pregnant?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As there has not been sufficient testing on this we recommend not using Coldscreen while pregnant.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Can I use it while on medication, drugs or alcohol?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Drugs and alcohol can affect your body’s heat regulation in different way and can cause it to fluctuate significantly. If Coldscreen is being used in conjunction with drugs or alcohol the user may experience a prolonged and increased warming effect. Please consult your doctor prior to using while using medication.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Does Coldscreen work on everyone the same?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Everyone’s skin is different, which means that every Coldscreen user will have a slightly difference experience of warmth and duration of effectiveness. Through countless studies we found and recommend that Coldscreen should be applied to clean, dry skin for the most consistent results.</span></p>

Lets face it, being cold sucks. Skiing, snowboarding, hiking and living your daily life is hard to do when the temperature outside decides to take a plunge. The disappointment of ending your day outdoors early because you or your friends are too cold is not something we should ever have to worry about.  Finally, a better solution is here.We all know the importance of dressing warmly and smartly, and how it can ruin your time outdoors when you don't. Coldscreen provides the user with an experience of warmth that an extra layer does not give. Our goal with this first version is to open this new choice to stay warm, and educate you on how to do so safely, this is why it does not prevent or cure frostbite or hyperthermia, but is able to get you out there on the colder days and keep you out there warmer,  longer  and focused only on the task at hand!
As the Winter approaches so does the dry air that is in a constant battle with your skin. Instead of focusing on a cure we are focusing on the prevention. Now you can use Coldscreen as your daily moisturizer and to keep you out there warmer for longer!                                                  Our ultimate mission at U°THERMIC is to open people up to new choices and a different way of thinking about how you experience the cold. We want to start a revolution in cold experience for every single person who gets outside to do what they love! We should only focus on having fun and nothing else, especially not the uncomfortable and deterring feeling of being cold.                                           Coldscreen is specifically formulated with the dry winter air in mind, we used the most safe and healthy ingredients with the highest percentage possible coming from organic and natural sources. 98% Percent to be exact. The rest is to make sure the product stays at the highest quality possible!                              Coldscreen  is able to work directly with your body. While your out there doing activity, your muscles generate a significant amount of heat which gives you the feeling of warmth. However as soon as your body comes to rest the majority of that natural heat is lost through radiation. Coldscreen actively retains your body’s natural heat while you’re resting, yet keeps your temperature regulated while you’re active, so you never overheat.                                                        THE COLD TRUTH

The body loses 70% on average of its heat though the skin
Dry skin is more of a problem in the winter months as there is less moisture in the air.
Whether it is dry skin or keeping warm, prevention is always better than the cure.
When you feel cold your mind struggles to concentrate and focus on the task at hand

After extensive research and partnering with highly experienced chemists specialising in all natural formulations, we were able to focus on all these problems and develop a diverse product that opens a new choice to help you keep warm and your skin healthy this winter. 





                
We performed the strictest of clinical trials to not only make sure that what we were using ourselves and our families was safe but for anyone who it is going out to. The testing analysed and proved the product in a 100% way through:
Blind efficacy study with a placebo 
Safety and irritation study and a full toxicology report.

Because our goal is to be as transparent and open as possible, the following excerpts are direct originals from the final study report.





     






                                              











                                         


Increased Warmth
Increased Time in lower temperatures
Increased Focus on your activities by not worrying about the cold 
Increased Space in your bags when travelling
Motivates you to get our there on the Colder Days
Less Restriction from Bulky Multiple Layers
Never get caught out if the Temp Drops while Outdoors
Easy to carry on you


                       
We know that a lot of you are wondering if Coldscreen can be used on your face. 
The answer is yes, BUT, not this first version of Coldscreen. We designed this version just for the body to get the best and warmest experience possible! This, we have achieved. Our Face and Kids version will follow very close behind, but we need your help to reach our goal so we can further develop these versions and ensure they are of the best quality! So please SUPPORT us! We are proud to be innovating everyones winter for the better!

Coldscreen was designed so that you can be out in a colder environment but still retain your warmth. If you do happen to go past the backcountry and end up in the desert you can easily wash coldscreen off with cold water and soap.



Will it clog pores or cause any side effects
Coldscreen has not ever had any known side effects and is clinically proven to be safe for all skin types. We recommend not using coldscreen if you have any existing skin problems. Sorry! We will be sure to include this in our next formulation.
How much do I use?The amazing thing about Coldscreen is that you only need the same amount as you would a moisturizer. It is possible to achieve a slightly more effective insulation barrier if more is applied, but this is not normally necessary.
How do I remove Coldscreen?All it takes to remove is to wash the applied areas with soap and cool water. Within a few minutes the warm feeling will dissipate. We recommend that if Coldscreen has been recently applied or a prominent warmth feeling is still active, to wash it off before getting into a hot tub or shower, so that you are not uncomfortably hot.
Has it been tested on animals?This can be as simple as NO. Coldscreen has never and will never be tested on our furry friends. Coldscreen is cruelty-free.
Can I reapply once it has worn off?Yes, you can. We based the lasting effect on half a day of being on the slopes, but if you just can’t get enough, then just reapply at lunch time and you will be good to go again. For the very best results, wash off existing product first.
Should I wash it off before heading to bed?For those of you who do not normally venture into the shower after a big day of outside activity in the cold, then we do recommend washing Coldscreen off with cool water and soap before bed. Unless, of course, you are sleeping in a cold environment and want that feeling of your own personal heater right next to you. Camping under the stars anyone?
Are there any side effects or possible adverse reactions?Coldscreen has no known undesirable side effects at all and no cases of any adverse reactions. As everyone’s skin is different, please follow the directions and consult your physician if a reaction does occur. We recommend not using Coldscreen if you have any skin-related health conditions.
Can I use it while pregnant?As there has not been sufficient testing on this we recommend not using Coldscreen while pregnant.
Can I use it while on medication, drugs or alcohol?Drugs and alcohol can affect your body’s heat regulation in different way and can cause it to fluctuate significantly. If Coldscreen is being used in conjunction with drugs or alcohol the user may experience a prolonged and increased warming effect. Please consult your doctor prior to using while using medication.
Does Coldscreen work on everyone the same?Everyone’s skin is different, which means that every Coldscreen user will have a slightly difference experience of warmth and duration of effectiveness. Through countless studies we found and recommend that Coldscreen should be applied to clean, dry skin for the most consistent results.",38.0,8,"1 Campaign

<p>OvenPlus is the perfect combination of a pizza oven and a smokeless grill.  Redesigned the placement of the heating source in the middle of the grill instead of at the bottom. This makes the flame from the plate-shaped Butterfly burner covers both the upper pizza oven and lower grilling area. Offering much more flexibility and allows you to bake, grill, stew, and fry in such a compact portable size.</p>
<p>This change not only provides a steady and evenly-distributed heating source, offers two times more energy efficiency and also make grilling much healthier and tastier.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570262676/gmu3ldf2vj4lke10kzwg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We identified two main problems with existing grills on the market: as their heat source is placed below the ingredients and the grate, the fat dripping on the heat source produces carcinogens that severely impact our health. Moreover, gas grills only have an energy efficiency of 20% to 30%, which means that they cannot sufficiently utilize energy. This has inspired us to reimagine the barbeque grill as an effective and easy-to-use device.</p>
<p>OvenPlus offers top-down grilling that is easier, safer and tastier compared to traditional, bottom-up grilling. No setting up coals, no scrubbing the grill, no standing around waiting for your food. Top-down grill prevents flare-ups from fat dripping, avoids meat sticking onto the grate, and offers a better grilling experience.</p>

<p>OvenPlus' flame can go up to 1100 °F, this is a perfect heat to create Maillard reaction that sears the meat with perfect grilling flavor and locks moisture inside. Every bite comes out juicy and tender inside by creating this mouth-watering dark brown crust on the outside.</p>

<p>What’s the secret for great pizza crust? The answer is the temperature. OvenPlus’ upper ceramic pizza stone can reach temperatures of up to 840°F. It takes only 2 minutes to bake a crispy pizza crust; put it into the lower grill for 2 more minutes to melt the cheese to a beautiful golden brown. A perfect pizza is ready within only 4 mins.</p>

This makes the flame from the plate-shaped Butterfly burner covers both the upper pizza oven and lower grilling area. Offering much more flexibility and allows you to bake, grill, stew, and fry in such a compact portable size.
This change not only provides a steady and evenly-distributed heating source, offers two times more energy efficiency and also make grilling much healthier and tastier.


We identified two main problems with existing grills on the market: as their heat source is placed below the ingredients and the grate, the fat dripping on the heat source produces carcinogens that severely impact our health. Moreover, gas grills only have an energy efficiency of 20% to 30%, which means that they cannot sufficiently utilize energy. This has inspired us to reimagine the barbeque grill as an effective and easy-to-use device.
OvenPlus offers top-down grilling that is easier, safer and tastier compared to traditional, bottom-up grilling. No setting up coals, no scrubbing the grill, no standing around waiting for your food. Top-down grill prevents flare-ups from fat dripping, avoids meat sticking onto the grate, and offers a better grilling experience.


 

OvenPlus' flame can go up to 1100 °F, this is a perfect heat to create Maillard reaction that sears the meat with perfect grilling flavor and locks moisture inside. Every bite comes out juicy and tender inside by creating this mouth-watering dark brown crust on the outside.



What’s the secret for great pizza crust? The answer is the temperature. OvenPlus’ upper ceramic pizza stone can reach temperatures of up to 840°F. It takes only 2 minutes to bake a crispy pizza crust; put it into the lower grill for 2 more minutes to melt the cheese to a beautiful golden brown. A perfect pizza is ready within only 4 mins.


 

OvenPlus is only ⅕ in size comparing to standard American outdoor grill, yet offers way more cooking flexibilities. The upper ceramic pizza stone can do more than just baking perfect pizza. Just set a cast-iron skillet on the top ceramic tray and use it as a regular gas cooker. Cook anything from pizza, steaks, burgers, fish, and lobster to a sunny-side-up egg, baked potatoes, and seafood risotto. With a easy-to-carry design lid handle, OvenPlus is your best choice for the everyday grill, tailgating, camping, and any cookouts!



 

With OvenPlus, anyone can easily cook exquisite meal like a master chef. Check our exclusive recipe includes signature dishes from top restaurant. Cooking dinner for your family can be just so easy!

 

 

 

OvenPlus perfectly balances functionality and efficiency with a special thermal and structural design that boasts energy efficiency of up to 80%, which saves ⅔ energy comparing to the regular gas grill, and performs multiple high-performance applications simultaneously.

We make it easy for you to download and use topo maps, marine charts, aerial photography and more. Not only that, backers will be first in line to suggest map services from governments or organizations willing to work with us. Overlays AplentyWe’re enabling the use of more overlay options than ever before, both free and affordable. These will include BLM Boundary maps, property maps, lake map contours, trail maps, specialty data and more. Whatever your adventure, we've got you covered.Recreation Overlay Easier Grid-Based OrganizationSaving map areas offline will be simple, with an easier, grid-based approach. Get it downloaded and keep it organized.Storage of offline maps Going Global with VECTOR TOPO MAPSDownload vector topo maps for the Earth's surface with easy installation. Compact storage will allow whole states and countries to be downloaded. Flexible styles will make them most readable for you. Vector Topo Maps - large areas, flex style Easy To LearnOne of the major pieces of feedback we've had over the years is that the existing app can be a bit difficult to get the hang of. For BackCountry Navigator XE, we'll be focusing on making the app easy to learn and simple to use, so you can get exploring the outdoors quicker than ever!Planning In The CloudWith the cloud editor, you'll be able to plan your treks, and upload tracks and waypoints to customize your adventure on the web before you go. Your plans will synchronize effortlessly with your mobile device so you can navigate the outdoors easily. When you get back home, you'll be able to review exactly where you explored.Cloud Editor with Easy Sync Sharing Is CaringWhen planning and reviewing your adventures, you’ll be able to create links so you can share your plans with your buddies. No Signal? No WorriesToday, your smartphone isn't limited to cell towers; it has the same hardware that’s been used by the military and handheld GPS devices for decades. Download the maps you need before you head out into the backcountry and your phone's GPS will handle the location tracking. BackCountry Navigator XE will work even when there isn’t any cell coverage. 
Hiking and Backpacking, both on-trail and off-trail
Camping trips to find that perfect camping site or the way back to camp
Kayak and canoe treks on inland lakes and streams or marine and coastal waters
Hunting wild game in rugged areas
Off-road vehicle driving
Search and Rescue (SAR)
Geocaching, cycling, fishing, and more!
 BackCountry Navigator XE will be using a yearly membership across the web, Android, and iOS. This is a necessary change from BackCountry Navigator PRO, because of ongoing costs, such as creating custom maps, running servers, and using cloud features. We believe that the benefits of the new and updated features far outweigh the cost.When BackCountry Navigator XE is released to the general public, subscriptions will be as follows:When you support us on Indiegogo today, you’ll get some fantastic discounts and bonuses! When you back the project at Bronze XE level and above, you’ll automatically become part of the BackCountry Community.In addition to regular behind-the-scenes updates, you’ll get the chance to be surveyed on the highest priority features, review potential UI designs, participate in beta testing and access the final app before the general public. Updated August 24, 2018. Given the current speed of development this is the schedule we expect to follow for the remainder of 2018. As part of the BackCountry Community, backers will get the chance to see, test and provide feedback on the app during development, and get access to early versions before it’s released to the general public.Beta of Website (bcnavxe.com)April 2018 to October 2018Beta of Android App in Google PlayJuly to October 2018Beta of iOS App in TestflightSeptember to November 2018Public Release of Android App & WebsiteNovember 2018Public Release of iOS AppDecember 2018Although I am now confident we can meet this schedule the final date for public release is still subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances. It will ultimately depend on App Store approval and our ability to find and fix issues found during the beta testing. Backers will have access to the app throughout the beta period and after release.And of course, release of a public version is never “final” as updates, improvements, and fixes are ongoing.With 8 years experience developing and managing the original BackCountry Navigator, I know exactly what it takes to successfully bring an app to market. We’ll be using the funds as follows: In 2009, I was laid off from Hewlett-Packard after 12 years working as a software engineer.The day after that, my youngest son Jonah was born.Talk about stressful!Where more sane and logical people would’ve gone and found another job, I pursued my passion for outdoor recreation and chased the dream of running my own online business.After many long days in front of my computer screen, I brought BackCountry Navigator to market, and after many more, it became the top paid app in what is now the Maps and Navigation section of the Android Market.Since then, I’ve got on to win multiple awards for mobile app development, written a book on ‘Android Apps For Profit’ and spoken at both AnDevCon (2011-2016) and Wearables TechCon (2015).BackCountry Navigator has been far more successful than I could’ve imagined at the time, and I’ve learned so much along the way about how software can help people in the outdoors.I know there’s so much more I can do with BackCountry Navigator XE to help adventurers like you to navigate the outdoors easily and I can’t wait to share this journey with you. Help me bring BackCountry Navigator XE to life, and create the world’s best multi-platform, outdoor navigation software by backing this project today.Thank you so much for reading, and see you in the outdoors!- Nathan :-)Founder of BackCountry Navigator XEP.S.

<p>The lift from the four propellers allows Airblock to do a number of stunts, and by selecting two propellers from either side, it can generate specific movements. For instance, the two propellers located on the back of the hovercraft drive the hovercraft forward. The two propellers located in the front drive the hovercraft backward. Getting two propellers to push against each other enables the hovercraft to go left or right. With a little bit of knowledge in physics and aerodynamics, you can even make the hovercraft drift, slide or rotate in any direction!</p>

<p><b>Why a Drone </b></p>
<p>When kids are younger, they only look at the things in front of them, but as they get older they start to look up and see a whole new world soaring above them. We have always been fascinated with what we couldn't do ourselves -- flight. We wanted to create a flying toy that children can make on their own and proudly exclaim it is their work and theirs only as it flies above their heads.</p>
<p><b>Why We Created a Modular Drone </b></p>
<p>There aren't a lot of drones that are created so kids and adults can build and play. The toy drones available now are so easily broken, so we wanted to created a drone that kids can build on their own and crash without having to worry about damaging furnitures or breaking easily. </p>
<p><b>Why We Created a Programmable Drone</b></p>
<p>Programming is not only useful for future programmers and computer scientists, but also plays a vital role in the child’s learning phase. We hope to use more interesting and interactive programming gadgets to foster children’s love for science and technology. We hope our gadgets can attribute to a child’s development and stimulate children to think independently and solves problems creatively.</p>

We've incorporated the amazing ability of flight with basic engineering and coding! It's not only fun and ultra-cool to play, but it gets you to see flight in a whole new way. And the best part … the Airblock is only $129!CREATE FROM YOUR IMAGINATIONWith magnetic attachments and modularity, the Airblock drone is only limited by your imagination. We want to encourage the spirit of creation in everyone!IN THE MEDIA FEATURES   Airblock is made of magnetic, modular parts that are easy to assemble and disassemble without the need for tools. Airblock has two main modes: hexacopter drone and hovercraft, but with its modularity you can create even more modes!Airblock is made of lightweight, engineered foam that is soft, strong and durable. The fans/blades are surrounded by hexagons, so they’re not directly exposed to objects. Airblock is safe to fly around kids and for kids to safely fly. A hovercraft moving in a triangular formation.

</div><p> </p></div>","The Tahquitz Pack, named after the birthplace of present day climbing, is built for those who aim to explore.Highly functional and modern in design we've created a versatile pack that conforms to your lifestyle—whether heading to the crag, traveling the globe, or dawn patrolling a surf session, we’ve got you and your belongings covered.  —      

Endless Possibilities for Packing     

 

Laptop Sleeve
Our internal pouch, capable of fitting a 15"" laptop, doubles as a hydration sleeve. With hose ports on both left and right shoulders you will be ready for anything that comes your way.

 
Cabrillo Integration

 
Hideaway Hip Straps
A necessity for any hike on the trail but in the way if you’re headed to the office. Deploy them on the trail or tuck them away on the concrete. They're designed to meet your environment. 
Hidden Water Bottle Pocket
Water bottle pockets can look sloppy, that’s why we’ve hidden ours with a simple zip. Bring whatever bottle you need (our stretch mesh fits most bottle sizes). Unzip, pack, and be on your way.

 
Impeccable Fit
Our suspended shoulder strap system keeps the pack close to your body while alleviating weight points so you can spend less time stressing and more time exploring. 
 
 


The Cabrillo Dry Bag plays an integral role to the Tahquitz Pack, integrating seamlessly into the side pocket.
Camera Case meets Dry Bag. The Cabrillo Dry Bag, like Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, is meant for exploring in places where the presence of water is absolute but the need for a camera is mandatory. In addition to being 100% waterproof, our molded foam insert will keep your camera and accessories protected from any element, bang, drop or tumble they might find.—

With 5 carrying options, each bag can transform to fit your needs from a weekend getaway in Amsterdam, to a month long safari through Tanzania.     We've designed two beautiful bags that work together seamlessly. Our Carryall Pack (35L) quickly converts from a duffle bag into a high performance backpack. And our Day Pack (15L) quickly converts from a messenger bag to a backpack.

The design for the Kosan Travel Pack System began some 10 years and 30 countries ago. Ever since we started travelling, we felt like there had to be a more comfortable and smart way to carry your gear. After about a year of planning and research, we finally put pen to paper and began designing the bag.  

  
Early sketches of the travel system
 
 
  
  

We are working with an incredible factory to design and produce this bag. Located in Vietnam, just outside of Ho Chi Minh City, they are absolute pros at making all sorts of technical bags, as well as paragliding equipment! When the quality of gear can result in life or death, we knew that this was the perfect factory for us.   

 

 

After submitting initial sketches and the first few prototypes, we hopped on a plane to Ho Chi Minh to meet with our factory partners face-to-face. We wanted to be very hands-on with the factory, to oversee the quality and get to know exactly where and who would be making our bags. 
We spent a week living at our factory manager’s dormitory, ironing out the finer details of the bag.

Every day, we worked alongside our team and met with and visited local fabric suppliers. We ate lunch with the factory workers (fish and rice) and spent a day testing out our latest prototype in the Mekong Delta with the team. We were even invited to a Vietnamese wedding where the karaoke was mandatory!
We spared you the audio...but in case you're wondering, they sang ""A Whole New World""

By funding a box, you're not only helping others in need, you're helping to make this project a reality.

They also add weight, and don't work in the cold. There are many good water treatment devices out there that work great, such as UV purifiers, but they're fragile, and the batteries are a hassle.</li></ul><ul><li> Chemical purifiers aren't perfect: Chemical purifiers are often toxic and have a limited shelf life. It's ok to use them for certain situations, but using them every day isn't recommended as toxic chemicals can build up in the body.

  Music: http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music          Our smallest bag in terms of size and weight.  Complete with full treatment instructions and a nice top handle for easy carrying and water collection. Specs: Weight: 0.5 oz (14grams) | Volume: 1 liter | Height: 10.5"" (26cm) | Width: 6"" (15cm)                                      Survivalist | One liter zip top solar disinfection bag    This little container packs up really small to fit into the smallest of survival kits but packs a big punch to waterborne microbes.  It also works well for measuring and pouring liquids for meals.  It can easily withstand boiling temperatures, so hot water can be poured in to make soups and MRE's, and the reflective back helps keep the food warm.                                                  Ultra compact | Heat tolerant    These bags are designed to hold water in, so they work great for holding water out!  They're great for keeping your gear waterproof. And as an added bonus, our plastic is touch screen friendly, so you can use your electronic devices while keeping them dry.        Super convenient and easy to carry, the Day Tripper bag isn't just great for survival and preparedness kits, it's a great bag to take with you wherever you go.Specs: Weight: 1 oz (30grams) | Volume: 1 liter | Height: 11"" (28cm) | Width 6"" (15cm)                            Day Tripper | One Liter, spout top, solar disinfection bag     It has a removable pop up dink spout and an easy carry handle that can be clipped onto gear.                                Free standing | Easy carry handle | Pop-up dink spout   When empty, these bags take up almost no space and weigh 80% less than a typical rigid water bottle.  The threaded opening is compatible with third party water filters, drink tubes, and pump filter connectors.                            Extremely Compact | Compatible with 3rd party filters     Our plastic is very temperature tolerant.  Bags can be frozen and used in your cooler.  The frozen bags will keep your food cool for a longer period of time than ice cubes.  When the ice melts it stays in the bag so you won't end up with the usual watery mess, and you will have a nice, cool, clean bag of water to drink.         Frozen bags keep a cooler cool longer | Doesn't end up in a watery mess       Our flagship design, the Backpacker, is a 2 liter reservoir designed to work with hydration compatible backpacks.  The reflective back is not only good for killing microbes, it also helps to keep the water cool inside the pack by reflecting away incoming heat.  Specs: Weight: 2.6 oz (76grams) with top handle | Volume: 2 liters | Height: approx. 14"" (35.5cm) | Width: 7"" (18cm)                           Backpacker | 2 liter reservoir with slide top closure and spout    The Backpacker has a fully open top with specially designed handle holes, which makes filling and cleaning fast and easy.                                                                  Quick fill | Easy clean  We've designed an easy to use slide top closure handle.  The grip portion retracts to be flush with the main part when not in use to conserve space.                           Our functional 3d printed prototype of the slide top handle Easy slide on operation.  Just fold the bag over and slide on the top for a SUPER water tight and pressure proof seal.                                                     Handle slides on to seal bag The handle can be placed anywhere on the length of the bag, so you can custom adjust to the desired volume and bag size, making it our most versatile design yet!                                   Handle can be placed anywhere along the bag   The spout threading is compatible with 3rd party threaded drink tubes and filters.                                  Compatible with 3rd party drink tubes and filters   Laminate blend plastic - SOL Water bags utilize a special plastics technology that has superior qualities for solar disinfection. Our plastic is a special laminate blend that allows maximum passage of UV rays through the material without quickly degrading.  Conventional plastics degrade quickly with constant UV exposure, lasting only 1-3 months.  Our special, triple layer, laminate plastic blend has been tested for over a year of continuous UV / outdoor exposure and it's still going strong!                                         Space Age Laminate Blend Plastics Technology Toxin Free - Our plastic is completely free of BPA, phlalates, and other plasticizers, which are known to be toxic to humans.                                                                   Non-toxic materials Reflective back - Every SOL Water bag has a built in reflector back that reflects and focuses UV energy back into the water, making for more effective and efficient use of collected sun energy. The shape of each SOL Water bag design is specially calculated to allow for maximum solar exposure per volume, while maintaining an ergonomic and useable packing and carrying shape.                                         Reflective Back for Solar Energy Collection Useful logo - The SOL logo isn't just a design.  The SOLar shape in the logo also functions as a water cloudiness meter much like a Secchi disc is used to determine the cloudiness of lake water.Water can be disinfected effectively even if it is moderately cloudy, but if it's too cloudy the arms on the sun in the logo will be difficult to see, giving you an indicator that it won't work and you'll have to either let some water out, let it settle for a while, or filter it first.                                          A Secchi disk being used to measure turbidity                                                         Clear, cloudy, and too cloudy Volume measurement lines - Graduate lines are located down the side of each bag so you can measure accurately for cooking or to keep track of how much water you're using.                                                         Volume measurement lines Detailed instructions - Each bag comes with detailed instructions for water treatment use on the back side.                                                         Instructions on backside Light weight - Our bags are extremely light weight.  Compared to other common 2 liter hydration reservoirs, ours weighs up to 50% less.  When you're packing light, every ounce counts!Extremely compact - These bags are able to fold down super small to pack almost anywhere.  Preparedness - Disasters and emergencies often happen with little or no warning.  One of the most critical needs after a disaster is fresh drinking water.  Most of the time, water is available but contaminated. SOL reservoirs are easy to store anywhere, take up almost no space, and can be filled with fresh drinking water for storage in case of an emergency.                                                           Emergency water storage The more places you store a SOL bag, the more prepared you will be for any situation.  The glove box in your car is a perfect place to start.                            Store an empty SOL bag in your glove box for emergency use  Great addition to any bug out bag! Bug Out Bag Disaster relief | Become a Humanitarian Sponsor - At the heart of project SOL we plan to use our bag technology to make the world a better place. We realize that with their unique technology and design, our SOL reservoirs can be a powerful tool to help others in need.    When empty, our SOL reservoirs can be shipped to an area easily at very little cost compared to pre-filled water bottles. Upon arrival they can be filled and distributed to disaster stricken areas nearby. After the initial water has been used, the bag can be re-used, following the directions on the back, to collect and treat water over and over every day for many months if needed.   We plan to create an ongoing means for these reservoirs to be distributed to disaster stricken areas. Individuals can directly help those in need by funding an entire box of reservoir bags that will be sent directly to a non-profit disaster relief organization. By funding a box, you're not only helping others in need, you're helping to make this project a reality. We've set up a special ""Humanitarian Sponsor"" reward for those with a heart of gold for helping others. After a box is sponsored we will package and ship it for free to a worthy non-profit disaster relief organization. And it doesn't stop here. This service will be available on our website forever with updated information about where these boxes are being sent. SOL bags would be easier to ship, fill, and distribute to disaster areas than water bottles and they can be reused to treat water    Two years ago we set out with a goal to design a new breed of water reservoir. As avid backpackers, survivalists, and outdoor enthusiasts we were unsatisfied with available water storage and treatment methods. Among other things, we found them to be bulky, cumbersome, heavy, and expensive.                           Balancing all the equipment required for pump filtering    We wanted a high quality water container that was puncture resistant, ultra-light, compact, easy to use and completely non-toxic.  But we wanted more than just a good water container, it had to be capable of treating collected water all on its own with no other device to add bulk, weight, cost, chemicals, or complication.  So using just the bag itself, you can destroy the harmful pathogens that might be in collected water and make it safe for drinking!     We didn't want to create more of what's already available, we wanted to introduce another way to treat water.  So we started planning...                                                           Project Prototypes                                                      3D Part Design Prototyping     With so many desired parameters, designing and developing this bag was a challenge. The most difficult challenge we encountered was finding a plastic material that could perform well with all of the stresses it had to endure.                                       Some of our plastics samples on the test board    This material had to be flexible, strong, durable, and puncture resistant. It had to allow UV radiation to pass through it to the water without becoming quickly damaged, blackened, or brittle. It also had to be capable of withstanding high temperatures without releasing toxins into the drinking water. During the two years of research, materials testing, and prototyping we found a solution. We discovered a special, space age, laminate plastics formula that meets all the requirements. We also took special care to ensure that our plastic is BPA, DEHP, and phthalate free.     In trial tests this special plastics formula has held up for over a year of continuous outdoor exposure.  Our prototype bags have been outside 24/7 through one full winter and summer cycle exposure.  They have been through many freeze / thaws, rain, sleet, snow, and blistering heat, yet they are still going strong without leaking or breaking.The solution is ready! Now we just need your help to make it a reality! So why were we so obsessed about NOT using filters, batteries, or chemicals?  Again, we didn't want more of the same. Every method has its pitfalls. We wanted something different that would work well on its own, but also have the ability to make other methods more effective. Filters aren't perfect: Viruses are so small that they can't be removed by filters. Believe it or not, even the top of the line sport filters on the market don't filter out small viruses! And, as we have discovered, filters easily clog up with use or break without warning to the user.  Battery operated devices aren't perfect: We all know that batteries go dead, usually when we need them the most. They also add weight, and don't work in the cold. There are many good water treatment devices out there that work great, such as UV purifiers, but they're fragile, and the batteries are a hassle. Chemical purifiers aren't perfect: Chemical purifiers are often toxic and have a limited shelf life. It's ok to use them for certain situations, but using them every day isn't recommended as toxic chemicals can build up in the body. There are some chemicals that are better for you than others, but they are expensive.  
Yes - but don't just take our word for it!   In fact, solar water treatment is recognized and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center For Disease Control (CDC), the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Sciences and Technology (Eawag) and the Red Cross.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey kids. I am Nate ""Igor"" Smith! I am the photographer and blogger <span class=""J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc"">drivenbyboredom</span>.com. I have made a living photographing some of the craziest stuff on earth from wild NYC nightlife to <span class=""J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc"">juggalos</span> to naked women to natural disasters. I am probably the only photographer who has been published in both Hustler and the Library Journal. I have been photographing for nearly 20 years, I have run <a href=""http://www.drivenbyboredom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Driven By Boredom""><span class=""J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc"">drivenbyboredom</span>.com</a> since 2001 and I have been doing them both full time for the last 5 years. </p>
<p>Despite making a living from this, I rarely get to photograph stuff without a client in mind. My favorite thing on earth to do is travel and I really want to do ""The Great American Road Trip"" but it is prohibitively expensive. I am obsessed with the motor history of the US and I want to travel all of Route 66 while some of it is still there. I want to photograph road side attractions and the open road, but of course I want to do it my way. </p>
<p>I want to pick up nude models along the way and photograph them in seedy motels and in front of road side attractions. I want to incorporate the naked girls that everyone loves so much about my work and mix it in with stuff I passionately want to photograph. I want to have crazy adventures and shoot a ton of 35mm film and make a old school black and white photocopied zine out of it. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to a couple clients I have already raised several thousand dollars for this trip and I have some savings, but I can't do it right without raising more money. In my mind I can do it properly for $6000. I have raised about half that so I need your help getting the rest. </p>
<p>The #1 thing you guys will get is the zine that I am making. It's going to be a super limited edition black and white, signed and numbered photo copied zine from my trip. I am pretty excited about it and I have some fun ideas for it if I can raise enough money. </p>
<p>I will be making a secret road trip <span class=""J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc"">Tumblr</span> that anyone who donates $5 or more will have access to. I will be sending anyone who donates $10 or more a campy road side attraction post card from the road. </p>
<p>I also will be giving away Polaroids prints of my photos on the road. There will be several options available so if you want or don't want something with nudity we can make that happen. </p>
<p>There are also product placement and photo shoot options you can get involved with at the higher levels. Get excited.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What Happens If The Project Doesn't Hit $3000?</h3>
<p>Ideally I would raise MORE than $3000 but perhaps that's not in the cards. If I raise at least $2000 this trip is going to happen anyway. I might have to cut corners and try to find local models but it's going to happen. </p>
<p>If I raise LESS than $2000 I might do a very different road trip where I fly to Vegas and travel to LA and then up the west coast to Vancouver. I hope to do this part of the trip anyway after Route 66 but if I don't raise enough money I will finance the west coast trip on my own.</p>
<p>No matter what you will get your rewards. If something disastrous happens and my car explodes three miles from NYC I will still get you rewards.</p>

<p>This is going to be awesome no matter what!</p>

<p>A Tinamp is an amp in a tin. It has an amp, a speaker, an audio input socket and on/off switch. It is powered by a battery so you can take it wherever you go to play music from your phone, your iPod, your mp3 player or your laptop. Your favourite music never sounded so good ... or looked so cool. Slip it in your bag or pocket and take it with you to the park, the beach, camping, a festival - anywhere where you wouldn't want to be without your music.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The first Tinamps were powered by a 9 volt battery but these need replacing and disposing of carefully. We asked our Tinamp fans what they would most like to see in the new Tinamp and they said ""a re-chargeable battery"". So now, with your help, we can design and make the new Tinamp with a re-chargeable lithium battery, a mini-USB socket for re-charging from a computer or an optional wall adaptor, and custom audio electronics - but still in a cool retro tin with that cute little on/off switch that everyone loves.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed that people’s first reaction when they see and then hear a Tinamp is to smile or even burst out laughing. That in itself is reason enough to make Tinamps.</p>
<p>There is something so appealing about playing music in a tobacco tin. Maybe its a reminder of happy days at festivals making roll ups with your favourite baccy tin. Maybe its about making something useful out of an old tin. Maybe the retro brands have a whiff of nostalgia - Colmans, Players Navy Cut, HMV’s Nipper the dog - which remind us of a different time. Golden Virginia seems to evoke most reminiscences of lazy summer days before the 'real world' intruded. Nostalgia isn't what it was.</p>
<p>I suspect it is also a fascination with such a simple ‘gadget’ - an amp in a tin. We’ve all got ‘feature fatigue’ with every new mobile phone. A Tinamp couldn’t be simpler - a socket and an on/off switch. Everyone seems to love the click of the old style metal toggle switch - so much so I’ve deliberately kept it in the new design.</p>
<p>People ask me where the idea came from. Well, I’ve moved home thirteen times in three years and travelled from the Canary Islands to India and back to Sheffield, UK - home of Joe Cocker, Jarvis Cocker and The Arctic Monkeys. So I always needed a portable speaker to play my music wherever I went. Then I saw a speaker in a new mint tin and the idea landed …”that would be so cool in an old tobacco tin’.</p>
<p><img alt=""the very first Tinamp in a Golden Virginia"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tinamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bob-Kronenburg1.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; float: left;""/>I made the first Tinamp in a vintage Golden Virginia in September 2012 and took it with me to the Picnic Festival in Amsterdam - Europe’s premier event focusing on innovation and creativity. Arthur van de Graaf of Seeds Investment held a pitch competition and I won €27,000 of ‘seed’ funds - literally seeds in bank notes. Bob Kronenburg bought it for more than I asked for his collection of artisan first editions. “I might be on to something here” I thought.</p>
<p>I made more Tinamps and did some market testing - literally, at Sharrow Vale street market and I sold out. “People like Tinamps”, I thought. And they do - except for the battery. In the first version I used a PP3 9v battery which needs replacing, disposing of carefully and is expensive.</p>
<p>So I asked people what they would like to see in a new Tinamp and they all said “a re-chargeable battery”. So the new Tinamp will have a lithium re-chargeable battery with a mini USB socket so you can easily re-charge it from your laptop, PC or optional wall adaptor. And I’ve kept the on/off toggle switch. Its retro in a modern kind of way.</p>
<p>What was it John Lennon said? “Life is what happens while you’re making other plans.” Well, its true. My plan was to return to Sheffield from the Canary Islands to secure investment for developing an iPhone app for which I have a Patent. (I’m still waiting for the investment to land). In the meantime, I started making Tinamps as if the world was waiting for me to step in … and now, with your help, the waiting is over.</p>
<p>In my previous incarnation as a mentor to startups in the Creative and Digital sector I was fortunate enough to play a small part in helping over four hundred creative entrepreneurs turn their bright idea into a successful business. Now its my turn to walk the talk. Some friends tell me I’ve never made anything useful with my hands before - well, nothing that stayed up for long. Tinamps may just surprise them … and me.</p>

A Tinamp is an amp in a tin. It has an amp, a speaker, an audio input socket and on/off switch. It is powered by a battery so you can take it wherever you go to play music from your phone, your iPod, your mp3 player or your laptop. Your favourite music never sounded so good ... or looked so cool. Slip it in your bag or pocket and take it with you to the park, the beach, camping, a festival - anywhere where you wouldn't want to be without your music.


 
The first Tinamps were powered by a 9 volt battery but these need replacing and disposing of carefully. We asked our Tinamp fans what they would most like to see in the new Tinamp and they said ""a re-chargeable battery"". So now, with your help, we can design and make the new Tinamp with a re-chargeable lithium battery, a mini-USB socket for re-charging from a computer or an optional wall adaptor, and custom audio electronics - but still in a cool retro tin with that cute little on/off switch that everyone loves.




 
A Tinamp will play your music from any device that stores your music and has a 3.5mm headphone socket - phone, iPhone, iPod, iPad, tablets, laptops and PC's.

 If its got one of these it will play a Tinamp (which comes with a gold plated stereo cable).

As engineers we were fascinated by this technology but were quickly let down by the gap between desktop 3D printers and industry 3D printers. We wanted to print usable, solid parts; not toys. Ever since then we’ve been dreaming of our own industrial laser sintering 3D printer.</p><br/><p>But since these machines are sold at six/seven digit prices. The only way to get one, was to build one. So, three years ago, we embarked on this mission. Since then, we’ve built several prototypes, went through countless all-nighters, won the Swiss UpStart Award 2014 and are now ready to present you the Sintratec, the world’s first desktop laser sintering 3D printer.</p><br/><h1>You can make low-cost laser sintering a reality</h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZM60LaFvIDNNPKNtJP04v0u2CyXo5BTIR5Ca4pr_RhVwpPHQ-kZuBP6kIFcfnyvyEgWjG9LIBqFkyK_oSa8CSO2mPUfLFd6uZHcA246toleLZmfLHthcO1Pe1AQcrpN5Fg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>With your help we are ready to take the Sintratec into production and deliver you a ready-to-assemble kit. By supporting this project, you’ll not only be one of the first who have ever built and used a laser sintering 3D printer, but you will also help us to bring laser sintering out of its exclusiveness to makers and developers.</p><br/><p>Although we have developed a great machine, it's you who has the opportunity to make low-cost laser sintering a reality. Together, let’s take 3D printing to the next level.</p><br/><h1>Be a pioneer</h1><p>By supporting our campaign you’ll belong to the first pioneers who have ever received, built and used a desktop laser sintering 3D printer. We put all the numbers together and decided that we need a total funding of $175k to successfully produce the first generation of Sintratec printers and ship the first units in July 2015. </p><br/><p>Read on for more details about the Sintratec and how to get one.</p><br/><h1>Enjoy absolute freedom of form</h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mvBIcSPqHflWAwN3S5pgQIvF7giLKjzMcZovxr8kUPM0wlBIeffY8rYODRakEwce9_2EWIoby4eJO397qZwul6PBVz__NuEmJOfTVQ1zeX2m0Kq40OpsoaA-yX1KULQ_ag"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Both filament and stereolithography 3D printers need dedicated support structures to be able to build complex forms. All too often, an object can’t even be printed in one go and needs to be divided into several parts. The Sintratec on the other hand does not need any additional support structures and can even build movable parts without issues.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1></h1><h1><span>Perfect for your application</span></h1><p>Whatever parts you need for your project, the Sintratec brings your digital objects to reality better than ever. You can print functional parts for your drone or RC gadgets, bring your crazy shaped design concept to life or build a prototype of your device before putting it into production. Create a model of your architectural drawing, print a master pattern for investment casting or even use a CT scan to print out models of body parts.

Even better, we are actually printing with the same quality powder used by machines which cost over $200,000. It is extremely durable, strong and at the same time flexible enough to prevent brittleness. Because the powder is sintered together, the final parts have a high mechanical load capacity in all directions and are not suffering from the weak bond between layers as is the case with filament printed parts. <p> </p><br/><h1>Make functional parts</h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Lj4kKDlrNIIvloDmss7qwhiIB6xOnHrIqzUDI0nkwtsMKr4xSwStzqpxb9rZ8x6dJO-1X-CFD7UPgvR1IHzyoX4rayCamRfvAb_tc50Mi8EL4ybaJUVG8SBVxqXr3CIReA"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The laser sintering technology and the superior properties of the printing material makes it possible not only to print prototypes but also to print functional parts.

We will be blogging about our progress to keep you up to date and allow for best transparency. </span></p>
<br/><h3>Can I get an assembled printer if I’m living outside of Switzerland?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we only ship those first few assembled and tested units within Switzerland. However, local customer collection is possible.</p>
<br/><h3>Does the Sintratec come as a kit or fully assembled?</h3>
<p>Apart from the limited assembled perk, the Sintratec comes as a ready-to-assemble kit. This means that you can assemble everything with basic tools like screwdrivers and wrenches. The kit comes along with a detailed manual for easy assembling. However, you will need to put in some time and effort into this kit. If you expect the printer to be plug-and-print after unboxing, this kit is not suitable for you.</p>
<br/><h3>What material do you use?</h3>
<p>We are printing with an industrial grade Nylon PA12 powder. It is the same material used on expensive laser sintering 3D printers in the industry. We also successfully printed with wax powder and are actively doing research on new materials.</p>
<br/><h3>In what colors can you print?</h3>
<p>All the Sintratec kits come with grey PA12 powder. Other colors are in development. The PA’s unique chemistry means the prints can easily be dyed or spray painted.</p>
<br/><h3>Can you print with metal powder?</h3>
<p>No, the Sintratec is not able to print with metal powder.</p>
<br/><h3>Where can I get more powder?</h3>
<p>We are going to open our online shop readily in time before the shipment of your Sintratec. You will be able to order the same material with the same high quality in our online shop. Depending on the progress of our research, new materials will also be available in our online shop.</p>
<br/><h3>Can I reuse the powder after printing?</h3>
<p>Yes, with regular prints almost all of the powder can be reused after sieving. However, if you print many different parts simultaneously, we recommend to use a higher print temperature to counteract warping effects, resulting in a bit less reusable powder.</p>
<br/><h3>What is the retail price of the Sintratec?</h3>
<p>We don’t have fixed retail prices yet, but it’s going to be above our lower crowdfunding prices. Because you make low-cost laser sintering possible in the first place, you get the best offer.</p>
<br/><h3>What is the powder going to cost?</h3>
<p><span>Exact pricing is not yet fixed but you can expect the price of 1 kg to be below USD 149. One kilogram of powder is already included in each perk.</span></p>
<br/><h3>How many parts can I print with 1kg of powder?</h3>
<p>This really depends on the objects you print with the Sintratec. To get an idea, the printed wrench weighs only 28g.</p>
<br/><h3>What operating system is supported by the Sintratec software?</h3>
<p>The Sintratec software is cross-platform, running on Win, Mac and Linux. We will though only provide official support for Windows 7+ and can’t guarantee compatibility to your Mac or Linux build. Please have a look at the more detailed <a href=""http://sintratec.com/hosted_files/SoftwareSystemRequirements.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">software requirements</a>.</p>
<br/><h3>What are the requirements to operate the printer after I build it?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You need a ventilated room, access to running water is helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>You need some space to handle the powder, filling it into the printer and sieving it afterwards. It is advisable to wear a dust mask while handling the powder.</p></li>
<li><p>You need a computer that satisfies the Sintratec <a href=""http://sintratec.com/hosted_files/SoftwareSystemRequirements.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">software requirements</a> as well as an internet connection to download the software.</p></li>
<li><p>You need access to power and possibly a different power cable than the one provided if your country has special wall sockets. (You need one that fits in your countries sockets. The cable should have the “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#C13.2FC14_coupler"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">C13/14 coupler</a>”, those are the absolute standard cables for computers and peripherals and are found in every electronics store.)</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>What resolution does the printer have?</h3>
<p>Our galvo scanner system can position the laser beam with an accuracy of 16 microns on the surface of the powder. At the moment we are printing with layer heights between 100 microns and 150 microns. Keep in mind the apparent resolution is much higher compared to filament 3D printing due to the completely different process. The minimum layer height is dependable on the grain size of the powder, which is about 60 microns, with a bit of a buffer on top,.</p>
<br/><h3>How fast is the printer?</h3>
<p>The speed of the laser and therefore the print time depends on your settings. You can print with laser speeds of 70-120mm/s without issues and above. The swiss army tool for example was printed in 60 minutes.</p>
<br/><h3>Are there any safety concerns?</h3>
<p>Compared to toxic resins used in stereolithography the printing powder has a very low reactivity. You only need a dust mask while sieving and pouring the powder (provided with the kit). If you have to calibrate the laser spot because it’s out of focus or misaligned you need to wear the Laser Safety Glasses that come with the kit while following the calibration guide.</p>
<br/><h3>What are the main advantages of laser sintering compared to other 3D printing techniques?</h3>
<p>Compared to stereolithography:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Significantly more durable</p></li>
<li><p>Stable when exposed to UV light</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom of form - no support structures needed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to filament 3D printing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Significantly more durable</p></li>
<li><p>Higher resolution</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom of form - no support structures needed</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>Can you send me a sample part or print my own file?</h3>
<p>Our main priority is to ship all Sintratec printers to our backers, so we don’t have the resources to print and send you individual parts right now. However, we always need parts from different applications and fields to improve our software and printer. If you send us a sample part of your application and we decide to use it as a test part, we will happily send you the part after printing it.</p>
<br/><h3>How long does it take to assemble the Sintratec kit?</h3>
<p>It will take you one to two weekends depending on how fast you work.</p>

</div></div>","We did it! Thank you so much for this amazing Indiegogo campaign! You made the Sintratec 3D printer possible.
Do you think that the currently available DIY 3D printers are just too limited for your application? Let's change that! We offer you the world's first affordable laser sintering 3D printer.



Sintratec takes low-cost 3D printing to the next levelWe started using low-cost 3D printers back in 2010. As engineers we were fascinated by this technology but were quickly let down by the gap between desktop 3D printers and industry 3D printers. We wanted to print usable, solid parts; not toys. Ever since then we’ve been dreaming of our own industrial laser sintering 3D printer.But since these machines are sold at six/seven digit prices. The only way to get one, was to build one. So, three years ago, we embarked on this mission. Since then, we’ve built several prototypes, went through countless all-nighters, won the Swiss UpStart Award 2014 and are now ready to present you the Sintratec, the world’s first desktop laser sintering 3D printer.You can make low-cost laser sintering a realityWith your help we are ready to take the Sintratec into production and deliver you a ready-to-assemble kit. By supporting this project, you’ll not only be one of the first who have ever built and used a laser sintering 3D printer, but you will also help us to bring laser sintering out of its exclusiveness to makers and developers.Although we have developed a great machine, it's you who has the opportunity to make low-cost laser sintering a reality. Together, let’s take 3D printing to the next level.Be a pioneerBy supporting our campaign you’ll belong to the first pioneers who have ever received, built and used a desktop laser sintering 3D printer. We put all the numbers together and decided that we need a total funding of $175k to successfully produce the first generation of Sintratec printers and ship the first units in July 2015. Read on for more details about the Sintratec and how to get one.Enjoy absolute freedom of formBoth filament and stereolithography 3D printers need dedicated support structures to be able to build complex forms. All too often, an object can’t even be printed in one go and needs to be divided into several parts. The Sintratec on the other hand does not need any additional support structures and can even build movable parts without issues.Perfect for your applicationWhatever parts you need for your project, the Sintratec brings your digital objects to reality better than ever. You can print functional parts for your drone or RC gadgets, bring your crazy shaped design concept to life or build a prototype of your device before putting it into production. Create a model of your architectural drawing, print a master pattern for investment casting or even use a CT scan to print out models of body parts. These are just a few applications where  laser sintering excels. What will you print with your Sintratec?Print like the “big ones”PA12, a Nylon, is the most commonly used plastic powder in industrial laser sintering. Even better, we are actually printing with the same quality powder used by machines which cost over $200,000. It is extremely durable, strong and at the same time flexible enough to prevent brittleness. Because the powder is sintered together, the final parts have a high mechanical load capacity in all directions and are not suffering from the weak bond between layers as is the case with filament printed parts.  Make functional partsThe laser sintering technology and the superior properties of the printing material makes it possible not only to print prototypes but also to print functional parts. This is the reason why laser sintering is widely used in the industries such as: automotive, aerospace, medical and the tooling. Take advantage of this by printing high duty objects for your projects. The SpecsCompact Size: 550x530x360mm. Fits on your desk.Build Volume: 130x130x130mm. Laser sintering allows you to stack objects or place them diagonally in the build volume resulting in a maximum build dimension of 225mm and thus, making the build volume quite large. Diode Laser: 2300mW, blue laser. The laser is compact and comes with high quality optics. The laser light is visible, making optical adjusting safer. Laser safety glasses are included in the kit.Main Print Material: Nylon PA12 Powder. Very strong and high resolution parts. Flexible if printed thin. Dark in color to better absorb the laser.Heated Laser Sintering: Both with a heating coil and optical heaters. A heated build chamber opens a whole new world of 3D printing: Objects don’t have to be fixed down on a build plate as it is the case with cold laser sintering, stereolithography or filament 3D printing.HardwareThe Sintratec is built with custom manufactured aluminum parts. Because of the heated build chamber the parts are made out of metal and fit together neatly. When you first look at and touch your Sintratec printer you will appreciate the high quality standard. We have designed the Sintratec not only to be functional but also to be straightforward to assemble and operate. For maintenance you can lift the “core” of the Sintratec out of the print chamber to get full access to all parts of the system.ElectronicsWe have designed a custom electronics board from the ground up to give you a solution dedicated to laser sintering. The board features the SAM3X8E, a 32-bit MCU from ATMEL, that comes packed with our own custom firmware. Among others, the Sintratec Electronics allow:
Driving of all the motors necessary for printing, as well as the scanner system and the laser.
Controlling of the powder surface temperature using an optical heating system with infrared sensor feedback.
Controlling the chamber temperature using the heating coil with thermistor feedback
USB communication with your computer.
SoftwareThe hardware is only one side of the coin. To allow for a good user experience, we’ve developed our own software to streamline the process from 3D file to actual print. The software reads in .STL 3D files that any 3D CAD software can export and lets you print and monitor the print.The Perks


The prices are without any VAT or taxes your country may charge. To ship to a EU country, the USA or Canada please add USD 200. To ship to a Swiss address please add the 8% MWST, shipping costs are free.To customers within Switzerland we offer an additional perk: Get the Sintratec fully assembled and tested, as well as delivered to your door, with a one day introduction at your place!Limited number of printers to guarantee 1:1 support3D printing is challenging, but all too often wrong promises are made during crowdfunding campaigns, resulting in frustrated backers and unused 3D printers. We are fully transparent and name these challenges to prevent wrong expectations.To be able to use your Sintratec laser sintering 3D printer you need to:
Assemble your ready-to-assemble Sintratec kit with basic tools like Allen wrenches and screwdrivers
Wire the electronic components as shown in the manual
Calibrate the printer
Become familiar with our easy-to-learn software
With a limited number of Sintratec printers we are able to give you 1:1 email support and can therefore guide you through possible issues that may occur during the assembly, calibration and usage.Furthermore, with your help we will be able to implement the features you request to make the Sintratec even better.Where are we now and where are we going?We have built and tested the fourth generation of Sintratec printers and the fourth generation of the Sintratec Electronics. The software is up and running. We already have fixed suppliers. What we need now is a successful crowdfunding campaign, so that we can start production.The TeamWe are three electronics engineers and share much of our background. Throughout the last few years we have been working hard and have learned a lot in the process. On the technology side Christian is responsible for the hardware, Dominik for the software and Joscha for the electronics, but we do much of the actual development and tasks, such as business development, in a collaborative process.

<p><br/><br/><strong>Fly Fisher's Best Friend</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you love fly fishing, would you like to have a fly fishing rod that is ready to fish when you are, in the glove compartment of your car? Over half a century, why haven’t rod makers created one?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Flexibility is the Name of the Game</strong></p>
<p>""Rod's flex"" is the most frequently asked questions for Pocket Ninja when any amazed fly fishers find out it is only 13"". I believe, ""Flexibility is the <strong>Name of the Game</strong> for a Rod with Short Sections. "" We all know that the shorter the sections are, the stiffer the rod become. For decades, fishing rod makers have been struggling to make a flexible rod with decent rod actions/flex with shorter collapsed sections that are less than 17”. We thought the solution is in the materials. We used fiberglass and carbon fiber to solve the problem. Despite the fact it has thirteen sections and is made with mixed of fiberglass and carbon fiber, it weighs less than 2.3 oz/66 gram.</p>

<p><br/>Pocket Ninja is a fantastic rod fishing with Japanese fly pattern Kebari and dry fly.  It is also  an excellent rod for <strong>contact nymphing/</strong>Euro-Nymphing /Highstick Nymphing:</p>
<p>1. It is a very high <strong>SENSITIVITY</strong> rod which would help fisher to feel fly contact with objects in deep water. This is an additional indicator and helps fisher to feel the depth of water.</p>
<p>2. Designed to cast with a very fine line. The fine line would sink faster because it is less friction.</p>

<p>Most of the time trout like to hang out in deep water. Casting a very fine line and small nymph, the rod requires good flexibility. I highly recommend using Nissin Pal fluorocarbon level line #2.5 or any fluorocarbon 10lb / 11 lb test. Nissin Pal is a hi-vis orange color. Fluorocarbon line is stiffer than nylon and has better a transmission property than nylon line. If you need Nissin Pal line, please let me know. I have a very limited quantity of #2.5.</p>

Tanuki Pocket Ninja is an 11'0""/335 cm long telescopic fly rod when it is fully extended from a  13"" / 33 cm collapsed length. It weighs 2.3 oz/ 65 gram. It is based on the Japanese ancient art of fly fishing, called tenkara. Tenkara fly fishing requires just a rod line and a fly. Tanuki Pocket Ninja is designed and built for fly fishers who love outdoor adventure and traveling. It is pleasant to cast and fun to fish with.  It is very compact and lightweight. The compactness means easy to carry around and convenient to use.

Feedback:

 ""Hey Luong... Rod performed flawlessly!!! The flex was amazing with every nuance felt from the hook set. Brought in a 13-14 inch rainbow; had great bend and control. I transferred the energy to the bottom of the rod, with a good bend and it was solid as the fish did a few feisty laps in the water, before tiring out, and I brought to net effortlessly... I loved it !!!! Yes,""  Jayms  Ramirez (a backer for project, a Professional Outdoor Adventure Guide Service and  Outdoor Photographer.)
Fly Fisher's Best Friend
If you love fly fishing, would you like to have a fly fishing rod that is ready to fish when you are, in the glove compartment of your car? Over half a century, why haven’t rod makers created one?
Flexibility is the Name of the Game
""Rod's flex"" is the most frequently asked questions for Pocket Ninja when any amazed fly fishers find out it is only 13"". I believe, ""Flexibility is the Name of the Game for a Rod with Short Sections. "" We all know that the shorter the sections are, the stiffer the rod become. For decades, fishing rod makers have been struggling to make a flexible rod with decent rod actions/flex with shorter collapsed sections that are less than 17”. We thought the solution is in the materials. We used fiberglass and carbon fiber to solve the problem. Despite the fact it has thirteen sections and is made with mixed of fiberglass and carbon fiber, it weighs less than 2.3 oz/66 gram.

Pocket Ninja is a fantastic rod fishing with Japanese fly pattern Kebari and dry fly.  It is also  an excellent rod for contact nymphing/Euro-Nymphing /Highstick Nymphing:
1. It is a very high SENSITIVITY rod which would help fisher to feel fly contact with objects in deep water. This is an additional indicator and helps fisher to feel the depth of water.
2. Designed to cast with a very fine line. The fine line would sink faster because it is less friction.
3. It is better ergonomics than Nymphing fly rod because Pocket Ninja weight only 2.2 oz /60 gram vs about 24 oz/ 680 gram of nymphing fly rod.
SENSITIVITY:

The fishing line directly connects to the rod which would help to transmit the vibration directly to the rod. A nymph fly rod, the line rests on the eyes of the rod, fishers have to depend on the visual indicator.
Secondly, it is more sensitive than a rod with a handle(grip) because Pocket Ninja does have grip.
FINE LINE:
Most of the time trout like to hang out in deep water. Casting a very fine line and small nymph, the rod requires good flexibility. I highly recommend using Nissin Pal fluorocarbon level line #2.5 or any fluorocarbon 10lb / 11 lb test. Nissin Pal is a hi-vis orange color. Fluorocarbon line is stiffer than nylon and has better a transmission property than nylon line. If you need Nissin Pal line, please let me know. I have a very limited quantity of #2.5.
ERGONOMICS:

Pocket Ninja rod's last section is swelled up so fisher would feel more comfortable than with the narrow style. The lightness of the rod would help fisher for a long day of fishing.

<p>We are a small team of four hikers in Portland, Oregon, creating the amazing gear that we've always wanted—but no one makes—with minimalist design, fair manufacturing, and reduced impact on the earth. We like to say, ""We make gear lists come true.""</p>
<p>Back in the spring of 2016, Gilad Nachmani was hiking in the Scottish Highlands where he broke his expensive trekking poles from a company that shall not be named near Cnoc na-Gareig (hence the name of our company). Frustrated with the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a new pair, he set off to prove you can make trekking poles cheaper and more repairable. It’s been a long, difficult, uphill-both-ways journey to get to this point, but we made it to the end of the trail and we’re ready to bring these poles to you.</p>
<p>We contacted nearly a hundred factories until we found the right ones. Most refused to work with such a small company or couldn’t make what we were looking for. Part molds costing tens of thousands of dollars had to be changed and some were lost in transit. New tariffs made our trekking pole parts more expensive since our US manufacturers have to pay extra for raw materials that aren’t available within the country and they passed the higher prices to us.</p>
<p>The main reason we didn’t give up on the poles is sheer stubbornness and a reluctance to quit. We are doing something that no one else is doing. We’re not relying on mediocre, off the shelf parts. By backing this Indiegogo you are backing something new and revolutionary in the outdoor industry from our small but mighty company. </p>

<p>Being a small company taking on big projects is hard and very, very expensive. We have been pouring all of the company’s revenue from the last 2 years into designing, prototyping, testing and finalizing the Cnoc Poles. Here is what it looked like so far: </p>

</div></div>","Made with carbon fiber durable enough to survive the first flight on Mars, the Cnoc Trekking poles have easily repairable parts—in case you make a rough landing. They’re made in the United States with a newly developed quick lock for secure adjustment, tips that are simple to replace, and comfortable grips made of natural, compressed cork or soft EVA foam.

The Cnoc Poles are designed and built to be the last poles you will ever need to buy, ready for years of adventures with you. 

 



 

Since 2016 there has been no large-scale domestic manufacturing of trekking poles, so we had to reinvent the wheel. When looking for production partners, we wanted to source expertise and innovation from people and companies with whom we could develop strong and long-lasting relationships. 

One of the companies we found was Goodwinds Composites. They make carbon fiber tubes of such remarkable quality that NASA contracted with them to make parts for the landing gear of the Mars helicopter, scheduled to land on the Red Planet in 2021.
Why be content with average poles made of terrestrially-bound carbon fiber when you could back our Indiegogo for the ultimate trekking poles in the solar system?
Our partners are small companies, like us, that seek to create, innovate and lead the market with exciting new products. By supporting this campaign, you are supporting real factories, with real people, that will see big growth opportunities in their area.  

 


The Mars helicopter needs to survive temperatures down to -200 degrees Fahrenheit, or -129 degrees Celsius, so your trekking poles will be able to handle all four seasons on Earth. It is uncertain whether flight is even possible on Mars. The helicopter is considered a high-risk mission. Our trekking poles will take some of the risk out of your hiking by providing you with reliable landing gear in case you fall. 
 

The right to repair is not just a motto, but how we design. Though most of our parts are made by our factories, most can be replaced by off the shelf parts, especially high wear parts like tips.
Our Easy Tip solution can fit the housing of any carbide tip on the market.

 

Surprisingly light for how durable they are, The Cnoc telescopic poles are the kind that makes people say “wow” when first held. Try it yourself. 

 

No matter your pack or your adventure, the Cnoc poles will fit the side pocket of your choice when not in use, and your shelter.

 

The Cnoc Poles offer a great range of usable length, allowing everyone to use them in ease: from 71 cm to 158 cm, they offer the same durable feel.  The extra-long deployed length allows for the Cnoc Telescopic poles to support most shelters in the market. 

 

To make adjusting the Cnoc poles easy, fast and secure we took the traditional quick lock to the drawing board, remaking it into a simple, light but truly secure lock. By adding TPE on the inside of our quick locks, we are using friction rather than compression to create a secure lock.
Introducing: the Friction Quick Lock (FQL):

 

Whether you are a cork user or foam user, we have the right grips for you:

Long handled, comfortable compressed cork for the telescopic poles, or
Long handled, ultralight and soft EVA foam
Ultralight and soft EVA foam in a short form for our UL staff


 

We’re making two types of extremely light carbon fiber poles to fit your needs, whether you’re a thru-hiker, alpinist, or simply in need of some support while walking. Take some weight off your joints when going downhill. Give those grinding knees a rest. 

 

Designed for the ultralight hiker: extra long shafts and a simple, short handle grip make the UL Cnoc poles a truly utilitarian tool and the right solution for backcountry challenges: from holding up a mid to crossing rivers.

 

Our TELESCOPIC POLES are durable, robust and ready for some abuse. These poles are perfect for thru-hiking, long backpacking trips and for anyone who needs some extra security when they move.

 


 

We are a small team of four hikers in Portland, Oregon, creating the amazing gear that we've always wanted—but no one makes—with minimalist design, fair manufacturing, and reduced impact on the earth. We like to say, ""We make gear lists come true.""
Back in the spring of 2016, Gilad Nachmani was hiking in the Scottish Highlands where he broke his expensive trekking poles from a company that shall not be named near Cnoc na-Gareig (hence the name of our company). Frustrated with the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a new pair, he set off to prove you can make trekking poles cheaper and more repairable. It’s been a long, difficult, uphill-both-ways journey to get to this point, but we made it to the end of the trail and we’re ready to bring these poles to you.
We contacted nearly a hundred factories until we found the right ones. Most refused to work with such a small company or couldn’t make what we were looking for. Part molds costing tens of thousands of dollars had to be changed and some were lost in transit. New tariffs made our trekking pole parts more expensive since our US manufacturers have to pay extra for raw materials that aren’t available within the country and they passed the higher prices to us.
The main reason we didn’t give up on the poles is sheer stubbornness and a reluctance to quit. We are doing something that no one else is doing. We’re not relying on mediocre, off the shelf parts. By backing this Indiegogo you are backing something new and revolutionary in the outdoor industry from our small but mighty company. 

 

Being a small company taking on big projects is hard and very, very expensive. We have been pouring all of the company’s revenue from the last 2 years into designing, prototyping, testing and finalizing the Cnoc Poles. Here is what it looked like so far: 

It wasn’t just the time and creative process, creating a supply chain requires heavy investment in infrastructure: molds, tooling, machinery. All this is very expensive, and we’ve been carefully and diligently funding it ourselves, but now we need your help:
Our factories have big minimum order quantity to make our bespoke, one of a kind, made in the US parts. Some parts are made by the hundreds, but some can only be made by the thousands, so in order to make one pole, we have to make thousands of parts.

<p><strong>Gnarpoon</strong></p> <p><i>Since Day One</i></p> <p>This was the first bike we were supposed to make.</p>
<p>When sitting in the woods at our local trail, this is the bike we wanted.</p> <p>The Gnarcissist hardtail actually started as a geometry test bed for this very frame, so you know the handling is spot on.</p> <p>Never before has one project caused us so much trouble. We had very defined traits we wanted out of this bike and we wouldn't settle for anything but perfection.</p>
<p>We have a workshop full of various Gnarpoons that fell short of that and were taken out in a field and shot.</p> <p>Although it drove us crazy, it was never far from the forefront of our minds.</p> <p>Whilst it is simple, it leaves no room for mistakes; every few millimeter tweaked, every degree altered changed something, it was like spinning plates.</p>
<p>A few months ago Lee solved it. We just needed the right guy to make it happen.</p> <p>Now, after many iterations of full suspension and hardtails, and many hundreds of happy customers across the globe, we wanted to go back to our original pet project.</p> <p>As the brand has grown, a considerable amount of sales end up being shipped to the USA and Canada, which is now by far our largest market.</p>
<p>One of the problems is the complexity of shipping in volume from the UK to USA. We figured if we could make and ship frames in the USA, then we could cut waiting times and costs. We just needed the right fabricator.</p> <p><i>In steps Frank Walderton, AKA, Frank The Welder.</i></p>
<p>Chances are, if you rode hardcore in the early 2000s, then you would know this guy. The go-to fabricator for a number of hardcore freeride projects.</p>
<p>Frank has been churning out beautiful sculptured pieces for the cultured hellian from his Vermont workshop for longer than I've been alive. A decade honed skill in a machine shop crammed with various vintage and hard working contraptions. A man who shaped the industry. Talk about good timing.</p> <p>Frank had some space in a warehouse to rent, we got chatting and naturally one thing lead to another. We had the opportunity to make Sick a transatlantic brand. A brand designed to appeal to hardcore riders, and to make and assemble complete bikes in Vermont.</p> <p>The end goal isn’t so much the building of Gnarpoon, although it is certainly one off the bucket list, but to create a complete manufacturing and bike distribution hub in the USA.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but it’s relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>We have the space, we have the skills, we just need the funding and the employees.</p>
<p>We’re in contact with the local business development group in Vermont and we are ready to make this dream a reality.</p> <p><strong>So what IS Gnarpoon?</strong></p> <p>Simply put it's a simple yet brutal, all mountain bike ready for anything, made with care by a true craftsman, an investment and commitment to your sport.</p>
<p>A frame as flexible as you need it to be.</p>

<p>For some people, they prefer the precision and response of an aluminum frame.</p>
<p>Riders have personal preferences and we want to offer that option too, in fact we’ve too quickly become just as keen on aluminum when used the right way.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543865962/notz5kmwgm3ssenjayhi.png"" src=""""/><p><strong>62:77 – Progressive geometry.</strong></p> <p>If you've not ridden a progressive geometry bike, you are in for an experience. Longer top tube, shorter stem, slacker head angle, steeper seat tube and lower centre of gravity.</p> <p>What does all this jargon add up to? A bike that feels that you are in it, not on it.</p>
<p>Most test riders get the same feeling, that the bike feels like it's slowing time down. More reaction time and more focus returning faster Strava times (we've all done it, I'm not even apologising).</p>
<p>Stability is the key. Without a twitchy front end, you have less calculations to make, you can stay on-line easier and hit speeds you never thought possible.</p>
<p>In the air, the bike is balanced with the rider, leading to predictable take-offs and landings. You can pick a line through root or rock gardens rather than just hitting and hoping.</p>

<p>All these standards we expect not to change anytime soon.</p> <p>Off the shelf bearings and fixtures.</p> <p>We designed every part of the frame with simplicity in mind. The bearings and bolts found on the bike are all easily and affordably obtained.</p> <p>Replaceable dropouts.</p> <p>Good for damage control in the event of a bad accident, but also give you a bit of choice if new hub standards or mech mounts evolve</p> <p>The money will fund a production run; the CNC machining, raw materials and Franks time and expertise.</p>
<p>If we overfund, we can include the necessary equipment and tools for complete bike assembly, refurbishment of the working space, pay for training of new staff and a provide a solid job offer giving a future for some lucky locals.</p>
<p>We’ve funded the R&amp;D and prototyping out of our own savings.</p>
<p>Lee has put in hundreds of hours of design work optimising the choices.</p>
<p>Our vendors have hooked us up with amazing component deals. We are ready to rock.</p> <p><strong>Custom, but, not custom.</strong></p> <p>We wanted our production complete frames to match how our customers build there, so you can choose a coloursplash for your components, and if you wish a decal with you name, or nickname and flag will be added to the frame, we can do that.

<p>Where possible we will colour match decals etc, to keep that custom shop vibe.</p> <p>Any questions - gnarpoon@sickbicycle.co</p>

<p>Our successful Sleipnir crowdfund also taught us timing and pricing, but there are very real challenges.</p>
<p>We’ve identified some of the key ones here, we always prepare for the worst and hope for the best, however unlikely, given our past successes.</p> <p><strong>Production undercosting.</strong></p> <p>We’ve been as careful with costout as possible including a number of scenarios, we feel confident we can absorb any undercosting by self funding.</p> <p><strong>Production delay / contingency</strong></p> <p>When you are dealing with manufacture lead production, we always build in extra weeks for delays, raw material shortages, equipment failure.</p>
<p>This is part of ‘on time in full planning’, should exceptional delays occur these will be communicated.</p> <p>We have a small team that relies on hand crafted products.

</div></div>","Gnarpoon Since Day One This was the first bike we were supposed to make.
When sitting in the woods at our local trail, this is the bike we wanted. The Gnarcissist hardtail actually started as a geometry test bed for this very frame, so you know the handling is spot on. Never before has one project caused us so much trouble. We had very defined traits we wanted out of this bike and we wouldn't settle for anything but perfection.
We have a workshop full of various Gnarpoons that fell short of that and were taken out in a field and shot. Although it drove us crazy, it was never far from the forefront of our minds. Whilst it is simple, it leaves no room for mistakes; every few millimeter tweaked, every degree altered changed something, it was like spinning plates.
A few months ago Lee solved it. We just needed the right guy to make it happen. Now, after many iterations of full suspension and hardtails, and many hundreds of happy customers across the globe, we wanted to go back to our original pet project. As the brand has grown, a considerable amount of sales end up being shipped to the USA and Canada, which is now by far our largest market.
One of the problems is the complexity of shipping in volume from the UK to USA. We figured if we could make and ship frames in the USA, then we could cut waiting times and costs. We just needed the right fabricator. In steps Frank Walderton, AKA, Frank The Welder.
Chances are, if you rode hardcore in the early 2000s, then you would know this guy. The go-to fabricator for a number of hardcore freeride projects.
Frank has been churning out beautiful sculptured pieces for the cultured hellian from his Vermont workshop for longer than I've been alive. A decade honed skill in a machine shop crammed with various vintage and hard working contraptions. A man who shaped the industry. Talk about good timing. Frank had some space in a warehouse to rent, we got chatting and naturally one thing lead to another. We had the opportunity to make Sick a transatlantic brand. A brand designed to appeal to hardcore riders, and to make and assemble complete bikes in Vermont. The end goal isn’t so much the building of Gnarpoon, although it is certainly one off the bucket list, but to create a complete manufacturing and bike distribution hub in the USA.
It sounds crazy, but it’s relatively straightforward.
We have the space, we have the skills, we just need the funding and the employees.
We’re in contact with the local business development group in Vermont and we are ready to make this dream a reality. So what IS Gnarpoon? Simply put it's a simple yet brutal, all mountain bike ready for anything, made with care by a true craftsman, an investment and commitment to your sport.
A frame as flexible as you need it to be.
Trail Life, or Freeride Hero.
Choose 160/150 or 180/170 Builds What is your ideal bike? Trail and Enduro race weapon? Freeride and Park-Bike monster? Kinda missing that old DH rig you had? We offer 2 styles of build kits at 2 different price points, from a big hucking dual crown and coil sprung rig, an agile and speedy weekend warrior race bike to a nimble and affordable trail bike.
Travel is adjusted via the shock with a choice of 230 x 65 or 230 x 60 so if you change your mind down the line, the option is there. 29” or 27.5+ Not much more to say other than this just makes sense.
All Gnarpoon frames can take either wheel choices, or both if you're feeling spicy. One Shape, Two personalities.
Real steel feel or hair trigger control. We offer 2 choices of mainframe. Choose 6061-T6 Aluminum or Double butted 4130 Steel. Identical in geometry and completely interchangeable with the same rear swingarm and cable mounts. It's no secret we are BIG fans of steel full suspension bikes; they are completely unmatched in terms of fatigue fighting ride and wild amounts of grip.
For some people, they prefer the precision and response of an aluminum frame.
Riders have personal preferences and we want to offer that option too, in fact we’ve too quickly become just as keen on aluminum when used the right way. 62:77 – Progressive geometry. If you've not ridden a progressive geometry bike, you are in for an experience. Longer top tube, shorter stem, slacker head angle, steeper seat tube and lower centre of gravity. What does all this jargon add up to? A bike that feels that you are in it, not on it.
Most test riders get the same feeling, that the bike feels like it's slowing time down. More reaction time and more focus returning faster Strava times (we've all done it, I'm not even apologising).
Stability is the key. Without a twitchy front end, you have less calculations to make, you can stay on-line easier and hit speeds you never thought possible.
In the air, the bike is balanced with the rider, leading to predictable take-offs and landings. You can pick a line through root or rock gardens rather than just hitting and hoping.
A steeper seat tube means the front wheel is planted on climbs and dropper posts means it's tucked nicely on the way back down. Future Proofing There is no point in building a bike that will become obsolete. We took onboard lots of real world rider concerns: No weird standards. ZS tapered headset, 31.6mm dropper post, 148 hub, 73mm threaded BB, ISCG05.
All these standards we expect not to change anytime soon. Off the shelf bearings and fixtures. We designed every part of the frame with simplicity in mind. The bearings and bolts found on the bike are all easily and affordably obtained. Replaceable dropouts. Good for damage control in the event of a bad accident, but also give you a bit of choice if new hub standards or mech mounts evolve The money will fund a production run; the CNC machining, raw materials and Franks time and expertise.
If we overfund, we can include the necessary equipment and tools for complete bike assembly, refurbishment of the working space, pay for training of new staff and a provide a solid job offer giving a future for some lucky locals.
We’ve funded the R&D and prototyping out of our own savings.
Lee has put in hundreds of hours of design work optimising the choices.
Our vendors have hooked us up with amazing component deals. We are ready to rock. Custom, but, not custom. We wanted our production complete frames to match how our customers build there, so you can choose a coloursplash for your components, and if you wish a decal with you name, or nickname and flag will be added to the frame, we can do that. Factory AF.
Where possible we will colour match decals etc, to keep that custom shop vibe. Any questions - gnarpoon@sickbicycle.co
 Challenges This whole funding process is a test, it’s a learning experience to help us overcome the challenges of opening such a challenging business. But we are ready to meet it head on.
With 10 years experience in Lean Manufacturing, meeting Franks dedication to the craft and innovation, we feel that we are ready to push this company further than anyone dared dream. We are grateful for the challenges the last 2 years have provided us, it has made us very risk averse.
Our successful Sleipnir crowdfund also taught us timing and pricing, but there are very real challenges.
We’ve identified some of the key ones here, we always prepare for the worst and hope for the best, however unlikely, given our past successes. Production undercosting. We’ve been as careful with costout as possible including a number of scenarios, we feel confident we can absorb any undercosting by self funding. Production delay / contingency When you are dealing with manufacture lead production, we always build in extra weeks for delays, raw material shortages, equipment failure.
This is part of ‘on time in full planning’, should exceptional delays occur these will be communicated. We have a small team that relies on hand crafted products. With that in mind there is always a human element. We could have one of the team suffer an illness or injury (we all ride bikes after all), we have taken in to account contingency planning with other in industry experts who can fill in if needed.
Of course this would be clearly communicated to all investors, and a vote be taken.   Component Shortages We have provisionally pre-ordered stock for these builds and there is no foreseeable delays. Should there be a delay, we will offer a partial refund or alternative component of same or greater retail value.

Check out http://www.cnbc.com/pop-up-start-up/Meet MyKoolBoxWith increasingly hot summers people require efficient cool boxes for their picnics. In most cases they also take some music play-out system and use their smart phones to find locations, chat and exchange comments with others.  The regular sight of holiday makers heaving rucksacks, cool boxes and audio speakers like desert explorers, stomping across sand dunes, or even setting up for a party in the back garden indicates that a more integrated solution is needed.Experience MyKoolBoxThe design of MyKoolBox is focused on being smart, fun and useful. Initially there will be 3 color options: white/blue, white/pink and stretch goal Black/Orange. This is important as  MyKoolBox wants to cater for all ages and tastes. Keeping the signature box shape, handle, speaker design and connectivity panel makes MyKoolBox stand out from the crowd.Drinks on me!!The container handle has been ergonomically designed for comfort and the interior bucket is fully removable and watertight. The top of the box has four cup holder indentations that stabilize drinks and also act as footings for stacking more than one box. Rain or Shine – The Party never stops!Located behind the control panel is the battery, amp, connectors and wires allowing for maximum use of the interior bucket volume as well as a fully removable lid. The speakers are also fully splash proof and situated high on the side of the box to protect from sand/debris (one major downside of portable Bluetooth speakers).Be Unique, Be ‘Appy’The audio system built into the cooler allows users to play music or use speakerphone  via Bluetooth connectivity (which 90% of smartphone’s and 100% of all tablets & computers currently have.) Song choice, volume and other amazing functions can be controlled from over 30ft (10 metres) away using our high quality Bluetooth system.  Be in ‘Charge’ of the PartyThe speaker system is powered by a rechargeable (USB) long-life battery positioned behind the panel on the side of the box. There is a 3.5mm jack point to connect headphones or non-Bluetooth mp3 players/phones so everyone can enjoy this product.MyKoolBox - My Way!!Customers can replace both panels with accessories and personal branding. (£79 super early bird perk and above). Customizing MyKoolBox is easy. Simply look through 100's of photos from our website or even upload your own, pay through PayPal and we will send you your new panels directly to your door. In the near future you will be able to browse through our special collection of accessories such as Solar panels for charging your mobile, fishing tackle boxes, and side storage bags to really customize your MyKoolBox.Who is MyKoolBox for?Beach Party ...Picnic Or BBQ ...​Our Story.We’ve come a long way since 2013 when we first came up with the idea to create a cool box that plays music. Since the age of 18, I have worked with young people as a holiday rep in amazing, sunny places like Spain, Greece and Mexico.                 I was sat with friends at a beach party in my hometown of Bournemouth, UK, when a friend came up to me cradling a blue cool box in one arm and a large work stereo in the other. First of all I thought ‘Wow! he’s carried those things miles – poor guy!’ and secondly ‘I wonder if you could put them together to make it easier??'Later that night I trawled through the internet and found no cool boxes that played music and none that could be customized. I strongly believed there was room for improvement in the efficiency of how we hold beach parties, BBQs, picnics, gatherings or get togethers. Through combining two essential party needs: music & chilled food & drink, our lives can be kooler than ever before. Armed with my strong belief in this concept I have spent countless nights designing, creating multiple prototypes, testing, programming, and travelling across the globe to pitch my idea and receive feedback.Team.MyKoolBox Limited is made up of international superstars. We bring more than half a decade of experience from the earliest stages of prototyping, product sourcing, product development, international distribution and accounting. We have advisers who were directors of multi-million dollar companies who have expertise in shipping huge quantities of products all around the world.                                       What you get when backing us.  Indegogo isn’t a store — it’s a new way for creators and audiences to work together to create things. The reward for us is that we would see the product we’ve been working on for almost 2 years finally go into production and soon be playing your favorite music!We have rewards for you on every level of contribution. Our rewards start as low as £1 and we would love to include you in our ever-growing MyKoolBox community where you will be the first to know about our latest announcements and special offers.                                                  The best super early bird reward? Getting your hands on one of the very first MyKoolBox for almost 15% off the estimated retail price.  Other Ways You Can Help:If you don't have the funds to contribute, you can still help us!

</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Mike is a humanitarian photographer who has
spent his career exploring the world and bringing back images of its
people.  His ability to interact comfortably
in situations where compassion and patience is required is one of his strengths.  Some of his portfolio can be found at <a href=""http://www.michaelmatlach.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.michaelmatlach.com</a></p>
<p>India holds a special place in Michael’s heart,
having travelled both north and south during his dozen visits, so when he heard
about Counsel to Secure Justice and it’s mission, he was compelled to act.  After spending the day with CSJ consultant,
Jonathan Derby, he volunteered to give his time to document through photography
and video, the challenges and victories of being an advocate for the survivors of
sexual violence.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What He Needs &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Here’s where you come in – as is often the case, where volunteerism and reality collide, Mike is willing to spend the month of October in India helping document their mission, providing image and video content for their website, collateral material and possible documentary content to be used to raise awareness of their cause, but he needs your help in funding the trip.  Expenses for the airfare, lodging, food and equipment total $5,000. </p>
<p>As a thank you for your generous donation, Mike is offering the following:</p>

<p>About CSJ: CSJ is a young organization that provides
survivors of sexual violence free legal and psychosocial support throughout
criminal proceedings, from when they report the abuse to police till
judgment.  CSJ’s current project focuses on survivors of child sexual
abuse in Delhi. CSJ advocates work on the ground—at the police station,
hospitals and courts—advising government authorities on the law, supporting
clients and monitoring the progress of cases.  They work with trustworthy
partners to ensure clients and their families receive the care and support they
need to begin healing from the trauma they have suffered. </p>

legal support to victims of child sexual abuse is huge</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Child sexual
abuse is a serious problem in India</b>. 
53.2% of children had experienced sexual abuse; 20.9% of
children had suffered severe forms of sexual abuse, including rape. These
percentages are staggering when you consider India has 1.2 billion people.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>More women and girls are coming forward to report sexual abuse in
Delhi</b>. Likely because media attention has increased after the gang
rape and murder of a 23-year old physiotherapy student in December 2012, there
were 1,636 rape cases registered with police in 2013, an increase of 132% from
2012 when 706 rape cases were reported.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Low conviction rates and delayed justice</b>. In 2013, only 27.1% of rape cases in India ended in
conviction.  A 2012 CSJ internal study
revealed a 20.5% conviction rate in Delhi and criminal proceedings took an
average of 28.7 months to complete.  </p>
<p><b>Victims and their families need advocates to support and fight for
them during criminal proceedings, so justice and healing are possible. </b></p>
<p>You’ve read the statistics.  Now here is a snapshot of CSJ’s cases: </p>
<p>Our clients’ average
age is 10 ½ years old. We represent ten clients who are six years old and
younger.  Two clients are one year old. 
We have four gang-rape cases, nine incest cases, one client who has a
mental disability, one client who is blind and one who is deaf and mute. 
While their stories are disturbing, their vulnerability demonstrates the
critical need for CSJ’s legal and psychosocial services.</p>
<p><b>Your money will help us share their stories and give them support</b></p>
<p>“Your presence gave
me strength,” Rekha (name changed to protect identity) told CSJ lawyer Eliza

<p>My name is Justin and I'm excited to present Chill Charters.  I provide unforgettable boating excursions in sunny San Diego.  Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign!</p>
<p>Chill Charters is set to officially launch in July.  My goal with this campaign is to provide discounted boat excursions for the people in my community, and raise funds to help cover the startup costs. There are two primary perk levels that will get you and your loved ones out on the San Diego Bay.  <i>For any contribution under $300 I will send you a gift card that matches your contribution.  You can use this on any Chill Charters excursion in the future.  </i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Let's Go.</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the past five years, while launching and growing the US program for Kiva.org, I met many entrepreneurs and involved myself in countless crowdfunding campaigns.  I coached small business owners on how to effectively engage their network, and time and time again I saw the power of crowdfunding in helping them succeed.</p>
<p>Now I'm doing it -- and it's actually pretty scary!  I'm hoping that this idealistic vision of community and connection and family and friends all align.  In many ways, crowdfunding is the most public way to succeed and fail.  As this gets off the ground, I feel I have the support to hit my goal -- but it's a risk and it's taking more courage than I thought.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>How it Started</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When I first thought of launching a boat business it was pretty random.  It sounded like a unique way to break away from the corporate-tech hold in San Francisco -- the opposite of a desk job.  </p>
<p>I started to do my research.  Other charter captains liberally shared their advice, and the deeper I got the more hooked I became.  So I took the first step -- I bought a little baby boat to test the waters.</p>

<p>(that's my little blue boat, Kirby, there in front of all the white sail boats) </p>
<p>I loved my 12 foot, flat bottomed, way too tiny boat.  It could barely handle the waters in the San Francisco Bay, if you went out with me you experienced that first hand.  It was almost laughable but I loved it.  It didn't take long before I was 100% locked on the idea.  Eventually I had to jump -- and here I am.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Connections -- Memories</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>San Francisco is a beautiful city, with access to so many amazing things. I loved my time there, but the intensity of tech and its influences on the city didn't always vibe with me.  I felt a lack of connection -- phones and apps and stocks and money and more and more and more of that.  </p>
<p>When I was out on the boat people stopped checking their phones.  We had real conversations that were authentic.   There was a true sense of presence.  </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>It's the water... the ocean has a force that impacts us in a profound way.  It forces us out of the day to day mindset, it allows for reflection and perspective. The tiny boat created a special channel for me to connect with my friends.  </span>Every boat trip turned into a memory that I cherished (shout out to all the homies who got to see it first hand!).   </p>
<p>I became obsessed with the concept of memories.  That was the impact I could make with this business.  Create real connection amongst friends and family -- and memories that would last forever.  That's the driving force for me.  That's my why.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Where I'm At</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In January I moved from San Francisco to San Diego to do this full time.  Over the past three months I've purchased and outfitted my boat, received my Coast Guard sanctioned captain's license, developed branding and marketing content, and figured out all the legal logistics in getting the business off the ground.  I'm finally ready for my official launch and I couldn't be more excited!</p>
<p>San Diego Bay is perfect.  Whether you're looking to cruise and explore or anchor and chill, it's ready for you to come enjoy.  Summer is right around the corner and there's nothing I want more than to take you out for some fun in the sun.  </p>
<p>On my boat I have a large tube that can fit up to four people and two stand-up paddle boards. You can also go explore the open ocean and search for seals, dolphins, and whales. Or you can find your own little cove and soak in the sun.  The San Diego skyline is beautiful and there's no better place to watch the sunset color the sky.  Bring your family, your friends, and especially your dogs!  The opportunities for fun are endless.  </p>
<p>With this crowdfunding campaign, I'm offering discounted boat excursions in order to get an initial injection of capital to sustain the business through the first year.  </p>
<p>Having more capital will allow me to better manage irregular cash flows and establish the appropriate runway to get the business off the ground.  All the funds will be used to support the month to month business costs.  This includes boat payments, docking fees, gas, maintenance, licenses, legal fees, marketing, and other business expenses.  Being able to manage cash flows and have that buffer is critical to my success.  </p>
<p>Here are my <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_12e6nutmD69AKP3GKRN3_1RwQ8TB9dXCOROMqrSflQ/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">business plan</a><u>s</u> and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scg2Xz59h_CiVwmZzv45J9vRGLJvwr0KkM5_e7rQkd8/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">financial projections</a> in case you want to learn more about what I'm doing.  I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and advice! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<u>The Perks</u> </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have three funding levels.  </p>
<p>1) $300 buys you three hours out on the San Diego Bay for you and 5 friends.  A $50 discount from the retail price!  You'll also get a bottle of champagne (when on the boat) and my signature Stay Positive sunglasses for everyone on board.  </p>
<p>2) $500 buys you one full day out on the San Diego Bay or 2 three hour excursions for you and 5 friends.  A $200 discount from the retail price!  You'll also get two bottles of champagne (when on the boat) and my signature Stay Positive sunglasses for everyone on board.</p>
<p>3) Any amount under $300 can be used as a gift certificate in the amount of your contribution.  This can be gifted to a friend or used on your next trip to San Diego!</p>
<p>Whether you are looking to relax, explore, or party (or all three!), you're going to have a blast out on the water. Let's go!</p>

<br/><strong>HOW TO  </strong><strong>USE KEELCRAB?</strong>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>VERY SIMPLE to approach at the hull! </strong></h3>
<p>Keelcrab can be used by everyone. Is vacuum engine is setted so that you need just to put Keelcrab in a good position in the water and the Keelcrab  will <strong>SELF DIRECTING</strong> to the hull of the boat. Watch the video below</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oMXabT7WeQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Keelcrab can be used by you, your son or by the person who takes care of the maintenance of your boat.  It has been developed to be an<strong> <i>user-friendly ROV</i></strong> and as such it can be commanded by anyone on his own in order to perform the hull cleaning .</p>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS!  Have a look!</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGlrVnIPqGQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>GREAT VISIBILITY AND CONTROL !</h3>
<p>The  remote control device with 7 inches display, the <strong>IP68 video camera</strong> with <strong>LED lights installed</strong> on the drone make the operation fun and simple.  By looking at the screen you are able to move your Keelcrab with the simple directional buttons on the <strong>remote control </strong>as well as to monitor and check the conditions of your hull in the same time. </p>

<div> </div>
<h3>HIGH MOBILITY!</h3>
<p>KEELCRAB is characterized by an exoskeleton in plastic material with neutral hydrostatic balance. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The vacuum / aspiration force is generated by a central impeller or turbine (propeller), driven by an brushless motor, which performs the dual function of keeping the robot attached to the hull and removing algae formed thereunder. The movement is driven by rubber brushes on tracks that allow movements in all directions as you cas see in this video.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> Keelcrab drone is a solution that respects the waters and the marine environment.  First of all, in order to perform efficiently its function Keelcrab is<strong> </strong>equipped with <strong>certified brushes ( soft-medium-hard )</strong> with nylon bristles. </p>

<p>The certification (A.N.C.C.P. ), obtained after several tests performed in a simulated environment , <strong><i><u>establishes that such brushes are not able to remove neither toxic fixed anti-fouling paints streched on the hulls nor the biocidal substances present in them but  just the overlying vegetation.</u> </i></strong>When the vegetation begins to grow it means that the anti-foluing is losing its biocidal effect and in fact, numerous tests have demonstrated that the constant removal of the first layer of algae (3 mm) dramatically prolongs the efficiency of the anti-fouling agent making it possible to reduce the quantity used over time. As a result of that barnacles cannot form in the medium term as they don't find vegetation and then a cleaner hull allows the boat to perform better reducing on the same time the fuel consumption</p>

</div></div>","We are enthusiastic to launch our new production of  Keelcrab Sailone 2018 with delivery starting from July. Order here on Indiegogo  to get Keelcrab OFF PRICE NOW!
 

 Who is our target ?

 

If you are a BOAT OWNER and want to order  Keelcrab Sailone for your boat, that means you have decided to simply  solve many of  all your problems and costs for the maintenance of the hull.
If you are a manager of  PORT/CLEANING SERVICE/YACHT CHARTER/RENTING BOAT service  and want to order Keelcrab Sailone, that means you can start from  DAY 1  to run a succesfull business model with all the support of our company thanks to our already tested  Keelcrab Point Platform that make you visible to your client!
 
KEELCRAB SAIL ONE: THE PRODUCT!
 




 
We design Keelcrab Sailone to create an extremely engaging and user-friendly product,  and to improve the experience of cleaning and maintaining  the  hull of your boat. Easy to use, easy to mantain! 
 
 

              

HOW TO  USE KEELCRAB?

 
VERY SIMPLE to approach at the hull! 
Keelcrab can be used by everyone. Is vacuum engine is setted so that you need just to put Keelcrab in a good position in the water and the Keelcrab  will SELF DIRECTING to the hull of the boat. Watch the video below

Keelcrab can be used by you, your son or by the person who takes care of the maintenance of your boat.  It has been developed to be an user-friendly ROV and as such it can be commanded by anyone on his own in order to perform the hull cleaning .
HOW IT WORKS!  Have a look!

 
GREAT VISIBILITY AND CONTROL !
The  remote control device with 7 inches display, the IP68 video camera with LED lights installed on the drone make the operation fun and simple.  By looking at the screen you are able to move your Keelcrab with the simple directional buttons on the remote control as well as to monitor and check the conditions of your hull in the same time. 

 
HIGH MOBILITY!
KEELCRAB is characterized by an exoskeleton in plastic material with neutral hydrostatic balance. The vacuum / aspiration force is generated by a central impeller or turbine (propeller), driven by an brushless motor, which performs the dual function of keeping the robot attached to the hull and removing algae formed thereunder. The movement is driven by rubber brushes on tracks that allow movements in all directions as you cas see in this video.

 

We have also available to complete and enhance the Keelcrab SailOne 2017, different optionals (possible to puchase also in the after market contacting us) here below visible clicking on the link. You can contact at info@keelcrab.com to order any of them. 
click here->ACCESSORIES LIST - TAKE A LOOK! 
 
 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE KEELCRAB WITH OTHER ORDINARY SOLUTIONS ? 
Absolutely yes!  indeed by solving the problem acting on the effect and not on the cause, Keelcrab can be perfectly integrated OTHER SOLUTION (ultrasonic paints  or ultrasonic antifouling ) which you are already using for your boat
 
WHAT ABOUT THE  ANTI-FOULING ?
     KEELCRAB SAILONE IS COMPATIBLE WITH  ALL ANTI-FOULING PAINTS  AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AS IT DOES NOT REMOVE ANY OF THE PAINT
 

 
 Keelcrab drone is a solution that respects the waters and the marine environment.  First of all, in order to perform efficiently its function Keelcrab is equipped with certified brushes ( soft-medium-hard ) with nylon bristles. 
Maximize the effect and duration of your paint. 
We designed 3 different brush to better fit for specfic need
Indipendent from the fact that your paint is with biocide or without, the following picture explain the 3 kind of different brush we have designed for Keelcrab SailOne
          

 
 
OUR BRUSHES ARE VERY EASY TO INSTALL!
DO IT YOURSELF!
 


 

 

The certification (A.N.C.C.P. ), obtained after several tests performed in a simulated environment , establishes that such brushes are not able to remove neither toxic fixed anti-fouling paints streched on the hulls nor the biocidal substances present in them but  just the overlying vegetation. When the vegetation begins to grow it means that the anti-foluing is losing its biocidal effect and in fact, numerous tests have demonstrated that the constant removal of the first layer of algae (3 mm) dramatically prolongs the efficiency of the anti-fouling agent making it possible to reduce the quantity used over time. As a result of that barnacles cannot form in the medium term as they don't find vegetation and then a cleaner hull allows the boat to perform better reducing on the same time the fuel consumption
  
OUR SUCCESS SO FAR!
 
""Our greater challenge is to change the mindset of many people and their beliefs!""

</ul></div>","BlinkLight is a premium led belt powered by Li-Po battery, remote controller and Arduino open source. Bike lights are engineered to be 360° visible and increase other traffic user’s attention. For day and night use. Designed to be worn on you or on a bike. From now on you don't need to take off your hands from the handlebar while making a turn. So minimalistic, so simple, so effective and so affordable!     Research done by the university scientists for the UK traffic police department prove that ""visible does not mean recognizable” – it means that wearing any blinking colored lights does not guarantee your safety on the road. It can cause a distraction, and as a result you can be hit by another traffic user.BlinkLights have been designed to be visible from all directions and well recognized – we used the same colors and modes of operation as in cars and motorcycles. We have combined the most modern led lights with a great visibility – we are proud of it!   You can wear it however you want. You can use it as a belt on your sport wear and it’s very comfy due to lightweight and elastic strips. You can put it on the rain jacket, strip it to your bag and backpack. Easy to mount to every bike. Compatible with a child seat and child bike trailer.   Radio operated remote controller has been designed to fit every bicycle steering bar. Remote is easy to fit. Two buttons are for operating indicators, one is for pedestrian crossing mode.   Currently, the best led strips on a market which allow to program every single led point separately. Best light quality during the day and at night! It will even light thru your long shirt :) Leds are protected by a silicone tube. BlinkLight is fully waterproof including remote controller.  You will get three lighting modes already installed as a standard: 
front white light with indicators (animated or classic blinking)
rear position and stop light with indicators (animated or classic blinking) both have pedestrian crossing mode
dynamic rainbow mode  
You can switch between those modes while turning BlinkLight on.    Arduino compatibleWe also give you the Arduino open source which is easy to program. Just plug it in to your PC and you can do everything by using C++. Every BlinkLight set will come with manual ,,How To''.  Stop light turns on automatically due to accelerometer installed on Arduino board. Our algorithm filter will know exactly when you slow down and when you speed up. Operating is very smooth and without any delays. You can count on it!   This function is designed to raise your safety when you want to cross the street. Just press the middle button on the remote controller and the pedestrian crossing mode is turned on.   One remote controller can operate five BlinkLights at a time. When you are cycling with family or friends, the leader can turn on the direction indicators simultaneously for the entire group.     You can use two BikeLights on one bike - one on the rear with red light and one on front with white front light. Both sets can be controlled by one remote controller. Each BlinkLight can be set as a front light or break light.   When you run out of power just plug it in to any phone charger. You can also use any power bank and charge it while cycling. Charging time with standard 5v phone charger takes up to 20 minutes and play time is around 3-4 hours.  Adult size fits most. We will make every BlinkLight length on individual request. We will send a survey at the end of campaign. Thanks to elastic strips you can adjust it to your needs. Works with bags, backpacks, bike racks, baskets, child seats and trailers.

<p>You can make the difference and help the elderly population of Costa Rica. The Wheelchair Project Costa Rica’s goal is to empower people to fight inequality in the region helping disabled and elderly people have a better quality of life. </p>
<p>This time our objective is to help part of the elderly population in Costa Rica that is left in retirement homes by their family, this for someone else to take care of their needs. More than 90% of the medical equipment used day by day in the Elderly Retirement Homes is not enough for all patients. The equipment is normally in bad shape, with rust, broken, etc. What we intend to do is to make these people’s life a little bit easier, giving them reliable medical equipment to supply their needs.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to help hundreds of disabled patients that because of their age need constant medical care and attention, by giving them new and trustful equipment. We are helping also all the nurses, doctors and volunteers that fight against the lack of good and high quality medical equipment every day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who are we helping?</strong></p>
<p>In this phase of the project we are trying to help more than 20 different elderly retirement homes that are with an urgent need of wheelchairs. Each one of these retirement homes have more than 25 patients to take care of, and in average each one own no more than 4 wheelchairs. The retirement homes are located in 5 provinces of the country, you can check out which ones will receive the donation in our facebook fan page.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise a total amount of $60 000 in order to buy approximately 207 wheelchairs that will be distributed within the organizations that need them the most. This will be phase one of the whole project. After our research we found that we will need to donate more than 1000 wheelchairs to cover part of the needs of disabled population in Costa Rica.  </p>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Our goal is not only donate some wheelchairs to people that need them the most. The lack of medical equipment for patients in need is a regular problem in Costa Rica, and we want to stop this problem once and for all. How? We are going to donate high quality wheelchairs with a guarantee of minimum 5 years, this to ensure the next generations in need to be able to rely on secure medical equipment. </p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Our goal is to provide high quality medical equipment to patients in need. The wheelchairs we are donating are made with high durability materials. Each of them cost $290 without the sales tax. Depending how many we buy we are going to be able to negotiate a better deal and we will be able to buy more!</p>
<p>The Wheelchair model is: MDS806300EE</p>
<p>Guarantee: 5 years.</p>

number of workshops and master classes. A big
opportunity for us to continue developing HereWeGo,
and with passion, hard work and dedication, make it bigger.









Help us help them! Help us help you!We believe we can improve and expand the HereWeGo platform, but for that we need your help. Our participation on Lisbon Challenge is an investment of dedication, hard work and money. Help us to cover some of our living and travel expenses for the duration of the program. With your donations we will also be able to pay for an extra developer so we can expand our platform, in order to include all the information we want to provide a tourist with disability.

1000 EUR will be used to cover part of our travel and living expenses in Lisbon
2000 EUR will be used to pay for some of the extra developing team
Any other amount will be invested in developing and advertising of our platform








What you'll get for helping?


Since we are good hosts we would like to offer you some traditional souvenirs from our home island, Madeira, or from the city that welcomes us, Lisbon! This way you will get a small taste of these regions, but we hope to meet you in any of these places, or in any other accessible destination throughout the world!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

In fact, 4 Billion people travel on airplane every year. Whether it’s a business trip, a long-planned family trip, or a weekend getaway, most of us needs to pack.  Packing is a boring, time-consuming task. We all have better things to do than planning what to bring and folding everything carefully into a small bag only to be unpacked again.Bring PAQ with you the next time you pack!Added to the inconvenience is the concern that our stuff will not get there safely. Many of us have been there. Whether it’s a broken sunglasses or a spilled shampoo bottle, it can spoil the whole trip and makes us regret not putting more care into packing.     Did you know that 20 million luggage are lost every year? No one knows how many more are mistreated. We’ve all heard horror stories of how our bags are thrown around, dragged and shoved into cargo. Imagine what all that would do to the stuff inside.We roll, we fold, we bundle. We pick the smallest bag possible so that the bag is a tight fit and won’t have empty space inside for things to tumble into a big mess.  We take precautions. placing each item into the bag with space maximization in mind. We use packing cubes and vacuum packs, wrapping anything breakable with shirts and pajamas, zip-locking all the bottles, cover our shoes with plastic bags to protect our cloths from dirt and shoeprints, etc.  Folding, zipping, compressing, wrapping and zip-locking is not the sexiest thing to do. Plus it takes up valuable vacation time.Some take 2 hours just to pack. My girlfriend did and we missed our flight. (A lot actually happened that day)Some just grab everything they need and shove it all into the bag. I did, and it costs me my good camera lens.The Game Changer  Wouldn’t it be better if we can choose any bag we want, fill it up with everything we need, and never have to worry? No spill, no broken glass, no wrinkled cloths. PaQ lets you do exactly that, and more…. PAQ Protects your stuff! Packing with PaQ is simple;    1. Pick a luggage  2. Fill it with all the stuff you need  3. Spread PaQ over the content.  4. Press the big yellow button (or use PaQ mobile app)  5. PaQ will auto-inflate until the bag is filled.’’Packing with PAQ, No straps required. How PaQ Works  PaQ expands and fill any remaining space inside your luggage, creating a tight cushioning fit. The tight fit that PaQ creates holds and protects everything in the bag together through bumps and swings. So, when you get to your hotel room, your stuff will also get there in one piece.How about the return trip? When our bags are so filled with souvenirs and crumpled clothes? No worries! PaQ can be folded to as small as a rolled T-shirt to save space.   PaQ can be used on all sorts of bags. So, wherever you go, however you plan to get there, PaQ has got you covered.  *PaQ helps protect your stuff inside a luggage/case.    **PaQ keeps your duffle bag/backpack in shape all the time.  ***PaQ tracks your baggage’s whereabout and notify you.  PaQ does all this while needing minimal input from you.

<h3>The Project In Depth</h3>
<img alt=""Sponsor a family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gehughes.com/boko-igg/family.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Sponsor a family""/>The Boko Bed Net Project (BBNP) is an exciting and innovative Malaria prevention project that we believe can greatly decrease the rates of Malaria. Malaria currently kills a child every 30 seconds. As the world’s temperatures increase due to global warming, the area where Malaria-carrying mosquitos can live will increase and more people will be exposed to this deadly disease. This is a problem that will not just go away.<br/><br/>The BBNP will prevent Malaria by substantially increasing the use of mosquito bed nets. Currently, mosquito nets are accessible in many parts of the world. However, country-wide bed net use rates are estimated at 5-50%. Getting Malaria net use rates up is an important goal because the nets have proven to be a cost-effective method for preventing Malaria.  Our preliminary research shows a simple fact; people do not use their nets because they are just too hot to sleep under; the mosquito netting reduces air flow by 60-70%. We have a simple solution to this problem.<br/><br/>The BBNP will result in a significant increase in bed net use through installation of a solar-powered fan and light console inside mosquito nets. This console will provide both air circulation and lighting inside the nets. Our system will not only increase bed net use but will bring a clean, safe, and reliable lighting source to houses, an additional health benefit because kerosene and other toxic forms of lighting are eliminated. Furthermore, the power generated by these household solar systems will have zero emissions and will not contribute to global warming.<br/><br/>The BBNP is also an income generating project for the communities that participate. Villagers are taught how to make their own solar panels and cell phone chargers. Cell phones now play an important role in remote communities as they are not only a way to communicate, but vital in emergency and life threatening situations. There is a great demand for affordable solar panels and cell phone chargers, and the low cost manufacturing methods we are introducing will create jobs and allow the village to start and run their community-owned business to meet this demand. <br/><br/>We need to raise $43,500 to implement this holistic project in two communities in Ghana, West Africa. This includes the building and installation of 300 household solar systems with solar panels made be villagers, storage batteries, interior and exterior lighting, as well as fan/light consoles to put inside nets.  Funds will also be used for workshops to teach the communities how to build and maintain their own solar systems and cell phone chargers. Your donation will also go towards an initial investment in tools, basic business training, and set up of the community-owned solar business.<br/><br/>So we're turning to you to ask for help.

into trying this sport and I loved it from the beginning and have focused on it
since then.  Through the years I have
practised and competited in almost all events. The last few years I practised
for decathlon but since autumn 2013 I have focused on javelin throw.  I have set sixteen national records in
javelin throw and several in hurdles and heptathlon.  I have won the Icelandic Championship in my
age group in many events throughout the years, most often in javelin throw but
also in other events. </p><p>In 2011 I competed at the World Youth
Championship in Lille, France and at the European Youth Olympic Festival in
Trabzon, Turkey. In 2012 I competed at the World Junior Championship in

Rieti, Italy.<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">At this moment I have qualified to the World Junior Championship

<p>The <strong>Kayrank </strong>Helmet Rank System is a military grade, durable, tactical device used to identify the rank of the individual wearing the Kevlar Helmet. The patented design is a rank device that snaps into the Night Vision Device (NVD) bracket on the Army Combat Helmet (ACH).  The device can be easily removed when the NVD’s require reattachment.</p>
<p>The idea was borne through my numerous military deployments that found Soldiers were unable to display their rank on their helmet due to the mandatory wear of the NVD bracket.  In addition to not wearing the rank on the helmet, the rank on the Soldier’s uniform was often times obscured by secondary protective gear.  This subdued device ensures a Soldier/Airman/Marine can be identified while wearing the helmet. </p>

<p>The rank design was tested in a deployed combat environment.  The first designs of the rank were tested to ensure they fit in all NVD brackets and were also tested on their durability and ability to be identified at different ranges. </p>

I already have a United States Company lined up to start production, so I need the final push.  By funding my project, you will be pre-ordering KAYRANK and kickstarting our first production run of units.
Finally, I have worked for a long time on producing this product from getting my patent approved all the way to working with the injection mold company to produce a product that works and that Soldiers want.  This product will be an asset to all uniformed military personnel. Thank you for your help.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>          Hello! I am Michael Kayle McCallum from the great state of Montana, and I’d like to invite you to be a part of my dream to start a new hotel. This hotel of mine will be like no other, with hospitality opportunities you won’t find anywhere else. <br/>         This coming January, I will be completing a personal goal of an 8-year military commitment to this country that I love and the state I believe in. I served five years in the United States Army and finishing my military commitment with three years in the Montana National Guard.<br/>          While I was active, I served under 4-4 Calvary with the 1st Infantry Division out of Fort Riley Kansas and 3-71 Calvary with the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum New York. Now, I’m serving with the 1-189th AVN GSAB out of Helena Montana. I'll be receiving my DD-214 in January 2021.</p>
<p>           Before my military career, I worked for two years in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota and 3 years as a Union painter (Local 707) in Cleveland Ohio. Prior to that, I worked on the road with the best paperhanging company known throughout the Midwest. I’ve lived in 9 different states in this great nation of ours and loved every one of them. I am looking forward to getting back to my home state of Montana and starting this dream business of mine.</p>
<p>Contact Information:</p>

<li>Best way of Contact - Michael.K.McCallum.Mil@gmail.com</li>
<li>Please leave a message - (406) 577-3468</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u> Description Of The Business </u></strong></h2>
<p>           McCallum’s Riverfront Estates (“M.R.E.”) will be a unique hospitality establishment with Montana’s beautiful scenery as its backdrop. Providing unique outdoor experiences through the development of a multi-use facility providing year-round resort accommodations. This establishment will consist of a restaurant and bar with an area for a variety of entertainment. Rooms will be available for overnight lodging along with a computer classroom for those looking to give a hands-on presentation or a training course.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594498396/b3oziooiqyo2orgompy8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>          M.R.E. will be located along a river for summer swimming, boating, and heart-warming campfires with family and friends. A variety of year-round group camps will include youth camps, ski camps, survival camps, couple/single camps, band camps, Christian camps, football camps, hunting camps, and so many more.</p>
<p>          The facility will also support outdoor activities including ATV riding, tent camping, RV hookups, horseback riding, hunting/fishing, hiking and lots more. There will be a large deck for outdoor relaxation with a variety of lounge seating and grills for personal use.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594498666/etjntkmzsp9vcd6origl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>          The building will house 35 rooms with a footprint approximately 50’ x 100’. There will be four floors with the first floor similar to the style of a walkout basement. The first floor will be the location of the bar, restaurant, classroom and the entertainment area. The wall facing the river will open to a large deck offering outside accommodations. This wall will have large windows reaching to the ceiling of the second floor, giving the bar and entertainment area cathedral ceiling and a beautiful view of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>          The second floor will consist of four rooms that'll have the accommodations of any quality hotel room you’ll find today. These four rooms will be located on ground level giving them their own access to the outside, while having a secondary entry from the balcony above the bar, just like the old western days. This balcony will wrap around the entire entertainment area and offer a quiet setting while admiring the M.R.E.'s beautiful view.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594500377/syvi7yrbcnr0wvtmscik.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:-.75pt;"">           Most of the rooms will be located on the third floor and won’t have your typical hotel room accommodations. These 10’ x 10’ rooms will have a unique step back in time hospitality feel and share public restrooms. These restrooms will supply the guests on the third floor with their restroom needs. This floor will be the location of the abundant sleeping accommodations needed when hosting the many group camps for which this establishment will be known for. It will also be ideal for those working or hunting for long periods of time in the M.R.E.'s local area.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:-.75pt;"">           There will be a suite located on the fourth floor. This elaborate suite will cater to large groups or for the customers looking for a luxury experience. This suite will consist of three bedrooms, with one being the master bedroom, another with two queen-sized beds, and the third having 4 bunk beds. These rooms will provide plenty of sleeping for larger groups. The kitchen will be fully stocked while having a nice dining area for a traditional sit-down dinner. The large and relaxing living room will house a fireplace with access to its own private balcony. Along with this suite, there will be two bathrooms and an office for guests’ business needs. </p>
<p>           The outside will consist of many features including a beach for relaxation, BBQ grills for outdoor cooking, campfires to warm up by, and a fenced-in area for guests’ animals to run wild. In time, I will install RV hook ups, small private cabins, docks, and an outbuilding for larger events. The M.R.E. will offer many options to our guests, giving it a wide range of clientele and successfully accommodating needs of all visitors.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u> Achievements From The Contributors Funding</u></strong></h2>
<p>          Out of this campaign, I am looking to reach my goal of $485,000. If my campaign goal is met, these funds along with my savings will make up the percentage of personal investment needed to receive my business bank loan.</p>
<p>          The campaign funding will purchase the site of the hotel which makes up the majority of my campaign goal. Installation of the large commercial septic system along with the 6-inch well needed for the M.R.E.'s water supply.  All the excavating needed around the location of the hotel and the pouring of the building's strong foundation. </p>
<p>          These beginning stages of construction have already been looked at by professional companies and they are all excited to start this positive and lively project. I will be ready to confidently continue funding the rest of this project with my business bank loan. With the completion of the first M.R.E. hotel and reaching my operational financial goals, I’ll be continuing my business adventure by looking for the next location of the M.R.E. hotels.</p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong> My Perks To You </strong></u></h2>
<p>          It is easy for me to create a wide range of perks for this establishment, due to the variety of options and outdoor activities. These perks will be provided to you at an incredible price. There will be several room perks available, along with perks for ATV’s, Boats, outdoor adventurers, and of course the M.R.E.’s main attraction the “Group Camps"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594503482/xjehufpawbez4eatmjko.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>           The first perk I’d like to offer is for $25 to all my fellow comrades. One-night stay with a burger and drink. If you think you can get another drink on me, I suggest you bring the best coin you have because I’ll challenge anyone, any day, with mine. The next few perks are the rooms for the many individuals in need of some good R-and-R. These low room fares are a steal and you won’t find better deals in such a nicer area. Along with your room you may want to pick up the $100 all day ATV/Boat rental. There is not an ATV/Boat rental shop anywhere that will let you rent an ATV/Boat all day for just $100. Just imagine the amazing weekend you could have for around $200 in beautiful Montana. If you’re coming with a large group, I'd recommend getting the suite that sleeps over 15 and is equipped with everything you need.</p>
<p>           Along with these great room rates I'd also recommend you getting into the action with our amazing ""Group Camps"". For only a $100 you could join in on one of the many day adventurers that the M.R.E. will be offing. These day adventurers will have everything you will need to enjoy the day that we set up for you. The $500 group camp perk is good for anyone of our many camps that will last up to 5 days and doesn't include any of our supportive camps. These camps easily go for over a $1000 anywhere else. So, get started with your next adventure with the M.R.E. today through these early bird deals.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><u>Thank you all for your contributions to help me start the M.R.E.</u></strong></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u> If I Don't Reach My Goal </u></strong></h2>
<p>          If I do not reach my set goal, no worries. I will get there one way or another. I am not a man that gives up on his dreams, nor one that watches them fade from failure. I will continue to find investors and continue working on the many projects that comes before a grand opening. Once I have the first M.R.E. established, there will be little to slow me down on opening many more of these soon to be well know hospitality establishments. </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u> The Impact </u></strong></h2>
<p>          The impact of the M.R.E. will be tremendous on strengthening any small-town local economy while offering refreshing R-and-R for hardworking Americans. It will assist those that are lost and thirsting to create a new life path with good values. The M.R.E. will have countless motivating stories, and I’m looking forward to contributing to every one of them. I’m looking forward to seeing the positive impact that my establishment will have and the ways it will strengthen the lives of the guests that visit. </p>
<p>          Along with the positive impact on people's lives through our fun filled activities. The M.R.E. will impact those needing some mental and moral support. The group camps will be a big part of this establishment and I’ll be looking to have at least two a month. Some of these camps will be much more than just a good experience but will be inspirational to ones that struggle with addictions, PTSD, depression, guilt and tragedy.  </p>
<p>          The M.R.E. will have a big impact on people's lives by hosting Terminally Ill Retreats to help family’s come together towards the end of a loved one’s life journey. PTSD camps to help individuals work through and put to rest their traumatic thoughts. Help first responders, our true heroes at home, with their depression that comes from those horrific scenes that they are called to every day. Camps for our wounded soldiers that have sacrificed so much for the freedoms that we have.  McCallum’s Riverfront Estates will be much more than just the location of a hotel or a summer camp but will signify a new beginning for many.</p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u> Risks &amp; Challenges </u></strong></h2>
<p>           Over the years of collaborating my ideas and putting solutions to obstacles, I have become very confident in succeeding with this dream of mine. It’s natural for every new business owner to have those feelings of fear from failure. I have overcame these feelings because I have done my research and looked into all aspects of how to truly make this establishment accomplish the feat of success. So, when asked what are my Risks and Challenges, there is only one… How am I going to keep the mind of my guests from thinking about their life of stress within the time they are visiting the M.R.E.</p>

 A Little Bit About Myself 


          Hello! I am Michael Kayle McCallum from the great state of Montana, and I’d like to invite you to be a part of my dream to start a new hotel. This hotel of mine will be like no other, with hospitality opportunities you won’t find anywhere else.          This coming January, I will be completing a personal goal of an 8-year military commitment to this country that I love and the state I believe in. I served five years in the United States Army and finishing my military commitment with three years in the Montana National Guard.          While I was active, I served under 4-4 Calvary with the 1st Infantry Division out of Fort Riley Kansas and 3-71 Calvary with the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum New York. Now, I’m serving with the 1-189th AVN GSAB out of Helena Montana. I'll be receiving my DD-214 in January 2021.
           Before my military career, I worked for two years in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota and 3 years as a Union painter (Local 707) in Cleveland Ohio. Prior to that, I worked on the road with the best paperhanging company known throughout the Midwest. I’ve lived in 9 different states in this great nation of ours and loved every one of them. I am looking forward to getting back to my home state of Montana and starting this dream business of mine.

 Description Of The Business 
           McCallum’s Riverfront Estates (“M.R.E.”) will be a unique hospitality establishment with Montana’s beautiful scenery as its backdrop. Providing unique outdoor experiences through the development of a multi-use facility providing year-round resort accommodations. This establishment will consist of a restaurant and bar with an area for a variety of entertainment. Rooms will be available for overnight lodging along with a computer classroom for those looking to give a hands-on presentation or a training course.

          M.R.E. will be located along a river for summer swimming, boating, and heart-warming campfires with family and friends. A variety of year-round group camps will include youth camps, ski camps, survival camps, couple/single camps, band camps, Christian camps, football camps, hunting camps, and so many more.
          The facility will also support outdoor activities including ATV riding, tent camping, RV hookups, horseback riding, hunting/fishing, hiking and lots more. There will be a large deck for outdoor relaxation with a variety of lounge seating and grills for personal use.

          The building will house 35 rooms with a footprint approximately 50’ x 100’. There will be four floors with the first floor similar to the style of a walkout basement. The first floor will be the location of the bar, restaurant, classroom and the entertainment area. The wall facing the river will open to a large deck offering outside accommodations. This wall will have large windows reaching to the ceiling of the second floor, giving the bar and entertainment area cathedral ceiling and a beautiful view of the Rocky Mountains.
          The second floor will consist of four rooms that'll have the accommodations of any quality hotel room you’ll find today. These four rooms will be located on ground level giving them their own access to the outside, while having a secondary entry from the balcony above the bar, just like the old western days. This balcony will wrap around the entire entertainment area and offer a quiet setting while admiring the M.R.E.'s beautiful view.

           Most of the rooms will be located on the third floor and won’t have your typical hotel room accommodations. These 10’ x 10’ rooms will have a unique step back in time hospitality feel and share public restrooms. These restrooms will supply the guests on the third floor with their restroom needs. This floor will be the location of the abundant sleeping accommodations needed when hosting the many group camps for which this establishment will be known for. It will also be ideal for those working or hunting for long periods of time in the M.R.E.'s local area.
           There will be a suite located on the fourth floor. This elaborate suite will cater to large groups or for the customers looking for a luxury experience. This suite will consist of three bedrooms, with one being the master bedroom, another with two queen-sized beds, and the third having 4 bunk beds. These rooms will provide plenty of sleeping for larger groups. The kitchen will be fully stocked while having a nice dining area for a traditional sit-down dinner. The large and relaxing living room will house a fireplace with access to its own private balcony. Along with this suite, there will be two bathrooms and an office for guests’ business needs. 
           The outside will consist of many features including a beach for relaxation, BBQ grills for outdoor cooking, campfires to warm up by, and a fenced-in area for guests’ animals to run wild. In time, I will install RV hook ups, small private cabins, docks, and an outbuilding for larger events. The M.R.E. will offer many options to our guests, giving it a wide range of clientele and successfully accommodating needs of all visitors.
 Achievements From The Contributors Funding
          Out of this campaign, I am looking to reach my goal of $485,000. If my campaign goal is met, these funds along with my savings will make up the percentage of personal investment needed to receive my business bank loan.
          The campaign funding will purchase the site of the hotel which makes up the majority of my campaign goal. Installation of the large commercial septic system along with the 6-inch well needed for the M.R.E.'s water supply.  All the excavating needed around the location of the hotel and the pouring of the building's strong foundation. 
          These beginning stages of construction have already been looked at by professional companies and they are all excited to start this positive and lively project. I will be ready to confidently continue funding the rest of this project with my business bank loan. With the completion of the first M.R.E. hotel and reaching my operational financial goals, I’ll be continuing my business adventure by looking for the next location of the M.R.E. hotels.

 My Perks To You 
          It is easy for me to create a wide range of perks for this establishment, due to the variety of options and outdoor activities. These perks will be provided to you at an incredible price. There will be several room perks available, along with perks for ATV’s, Boats, outdoor adventurers, and of course the M.R.E.’s main attraction the “Group Camps"".

           The first perk I’d like to offer is for $25 to all my fellow comrades. One-night stay with a burger and drink. If you think you can get another drink on me, I suggest you bring the best coin you have because I’ll challenge anyone, any day, with mine. The next few perks are the rooms for the many individuals in need of some good R-and-R. These low room fares are a steal and you won’t find better deals in such a nicer area. Along with your room you may want to pick up the $100 all day ATV/Boat rental. There is not an ATV/Boat rental shop anywhere that will let you rent an ATV/Boat all day for just $100. Just imagine the amazing weekend you could have for around $200 in beautiful Montana. If you’re coming with a large group, I'd recommend getting the suite that sleeps over 15 and is equipped with everything you need.
           Along with these great room rates I'd also recommend you getting into the action with our amazing ""Group Camps"". For only a $100 you could join in on one of the many day adventurers that the M.R.E. will be offing. These day adventurers will have everything you will need to enjoy the day that we set up for you. The $500 group camp perk is good for anyone of our many camps that will last up to 5 days and doesn't include any of our supportive camps. These camps easily go for over a $1000 anywhere else. So, get started with your next adventure with the M.R.E. today through these early bird deals.
Thank you all for your contributions to help me start the M.R.E.
 If I Don't Reach My Goal 
          If I do not reach my set goal, no worries. I will get there one way or another. I am not a man that gives up on his dreams, nor one that watches them fade from failure. I will continue to find investors and continue working on the many projects that comes before a grand opening. Once I have the first M.R.E. established, there will be little to slow me down on opening many more of these soon to be well know hospitality establishments. 

 The Impact 
          The impact of the M.R.E. will be tremendous on strengthening any small-town local economy while offering refreshing R-and-R for hardworking Americans. It will assist those that are lost and thirsting to create a new life path with good values. The M.R.E. will have countless motivating stories, and I’m looking forward to contributing to every one of them. I’m looking forward to seeing the positive impact that my establishment will have and the ways it will strengthen the lives of the guests that visit. 
          Along with the positive impact on people's lives through our fun filled activities. The M.R.E. will impact those needing some mental and moral support. The group camps will be a big part of this establishment and I’ll be looking to have at least two a month. Some of these camps will be much more than just a good experience but will be inspirational to ones that struggle with addictions, PTSD, depression, guilt and tragedy.  
          The M.R.E. will have a big impact on people's lives by hosting Terminally Ill Retreats to help family’s come together towards the end of a loved one’s life journey. PTSD camps to help individuals work through and put to rest their traumatic thoughts. Help first responders, our true heroes at home, with their depression that comes from those horrific scenes that they are called to every day. Camps for our wounded soldiers that have sacrificed so much for the freedoms that we have.  McCallum’s Riverfront Estates will be much more than just the location of a hotel or a summer camp but will signify a new beginning for many.

 Risks & Challenges 
           Over the years of collaborating my ideas and putting solutions to obstacles, I have become very confident in succeeding with this dream of mine. It’s natural for every new business owner to have those feelings of fear from failure. I have overcame these feelings because I have done my research and looked into all aspects of how to truly make this establishment accomplish the feat of success. So, when asked what are my Risks and Challenges, there is only one… How am I going to keep the mind of my guests from thinking about their life of stress within the time they are visiting the M.R.E.

<p>In 2007 my life was coming to an end because of my past life style as a touring rock musican. I was going to leave four wonderful children and a wonderful wife behind. There were no hope to survive due to the incurable diseases the alcohol and drugs had done in my body. For several years I worked with members from Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, Status Quo and Whitesnake but I can not blame what happened to me on the music or my friends. It was the fear and anxiety inside of me that took over the control of my life. One night I had an encounter with Jesus and He did what was impossible for the doctors.</p>
<p>Now 8 years later I am totally healed, set free from drugs and alcohol and I have a purpose for my life; to be a better father for my children, the husband my wife deserves after all the years she watched me slowly kill myself with drugs and alcohol and I have a bold message to tell about Jesus Christ who dragged me up from the horrible pit of destruction and gave me a mission; to plunder hell and populate heaven.</p>
<p>The last seven years I have traveled around the world with my music and my life story. In 2014 we did 151 events and we saw people receive Jesus Christ into their lives and what is more worth than see people get saved and see people get a new life.</p>
<p>Now it is time to travel back to Florida and we start in Daytona Beach with Daytona Bike Week 2015. For five days we are going to be playing music in the midst of hundreds of thousands of bikers together with the Music For The Soul stage. I personally think Bike Week is a place where Jesus Himself would have gone.</p>
<p>After Bike Week we are staying another two weeks in Florida to minister in youth facilities such as Teen Challenge, alcohol- &amp; drug rehabs as well as be part of some outreach concerts and events. Last March we did 11 meetings in five days and we saw God do wonderful things in the prisons as well. People got saved and not only one or two. I am not into numbers as God is taking care of them. I just want to do my part and do what Jesus told me to do when He visited me on my deathbed:<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>GO OUT AND TELL ALL THE PEOPLE ABOUT ME AND YOUR LIFE!

<p>Hi my name is Charles Werb, the founder of the Outer
Edge Polar Challenge ride for Leukaemia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/992572/files/20141106172151-charles.jpg?1415323311"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Whilst the dream to explore Antarctica only
manifested itself 4 years ago I can remember at the age of 24 doing some
drawings that showed a wind powered vehicle with Big Foot tyres for use on sand
or desert exploration.</p>
<p>For years I have played with wind powered “toys” be
they kites or sails and when the decision was made to go to Antarctica I
thought well why not something that has never been done before do? Let’s
attempt to sail around the Polar Plateau in a snow sailer.</p>
<p>Now this is something that you cannot just go and
buy from your local adventure retailer. In fact my research took me down the
path of ice sailers and some video on guys trying to use kite buggy’s with
skis. </p>
<p>Whilst the ice sailers tracked impressively the buggy’s with skis could
not hold a straight line, they kept on having a side slip. It was then that I
had my first eureka moment…..Why not fit snowboards with ice blades attached
below like a keel and see what happens. Now I am not the first to do this, but
the method we used can be seen in the results we have produced to date.</p>

<p>So now I realised I had the vehicle, what about the
motivation? How am I going to do this. What do I need to put in place to make
this happen? The mind went into overdrive and then an opportunity presented
itself.</p>
<p>I bought Outer Edge Magazine. Not because of what it
had done in the market place but because of what I believed I could bring to
this publication - the opportunity to live my dream and to bring into it the
undertaking of a World First initiative. And the best part about this is that
our readers, sponsors and advertisers are all coming along for the ride.</p>
<p>Within 4 weeks of taking over Outer Edge Magazine my
Dad passed away after batting Lymphoma for 3 and 1/2 years. I had the opportunity
of confiding in him what I wanted to do, the great thing is that he immediately
understood what it was I wanted to do and my reasons why. </p>
<p>4 weeks later Dad had

event the Outer Edge Polar Challenge Ride for Leukaemia and dedicate in memory

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/992479/files/20141106164116-Adrian.jpg?1415320876"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Dr Adrian McCallum is a
glaciologist who currently lectures in science &amp; engineering at the
University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland; he manages courses in soil
mechanics, geotechnical engineering and climate change adaptation. He is
fortunate to have led a life of adventure and exploration around the globe and
is an expert in remote area science &amp; engineering.</p>
<p>He holds a PhD from the
Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge and additional degrees
in oceanography, meteorology and civil engineering. In 2002 he was awarded the
Australian Centenary Medal for his stewardship of the 2001 Australian Army
Centenary Everest Expedition and he is a Menzies Scholar and Director of the
Menzies Foundation; a non-profit, non-political organisation created to promote
excellence in research, scholarship and postgraduate study by Australians.</p>
<p>During twenty years
service across the Australian Defence Forces he served in numerous diverse
roles such as helicopter navigator, meteorologist and civil engineer and he has
led or participated in adventurous scientific expeditions around the globe.
These investigations have taken him to many far-flung locations including
Svalbard, Greenland, across the Arctic and Antarctica, and to the Himalaya and
the ice caps of Patagonia. He orchestrated Sir Ranulph Fiennes' groundbreaking
2013 winter Transantarctic expedition and regularly consults to the Australian
Antarctic Division on polar infrastructural and operational matters.</p>
<p>There are a number of
reasons why Adrian is very excited to be involved with the Outer Edge Polar
Challenge.</p>
<p>Firstly, he is dedicated
to the pursuit of remote area scientific and engineering investigations,
particularly via lightweight and innovative means. The Outer Edge Polar
Challenge is a perfect exemplar of this concept: innovative, lightweight,
wind-propelled vehicles, crossing expanses of remote terrain whilst gathering
scientific data, in an intimate and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Adrian plans to tow an
ice penetrating radar behind his snowsailer, enabling ice thickness estimates
to be collected along the entire journey; much of the proposed route is over
ice of unknown extent, so these data will contribute greatly to literally ‘filling
in the blanks’. Additional science to be conducted on the traverse may include
instrumenting the snowsailers to monitor their condition whist traversing
thousand of miles of ice and snow and additionally, monitoring surface friction
and snow density along the route.</p>
<p>Even more important
than the scientific data that he expects to collect, Adrian is enthusiastic
about the vehicle that the expedition offers as a means to entice students into
a career in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM); that
being a scientist doesn’t have to mean wearing a lab coat, but can involve travelling
to anywhere in the world, gathering data that may otherwise be unobtainable,
unless combined with a little adventure…</p>
<p>Finally, with so many
families around the world affected by relatives and loved ones afflicted with Leukemia,
the opportunity to fly the flag in support of the Queensland Leukemia Foundation
and to assist in raising funds for ongoing Leukemia research is the primary factor
that drives Adrian and the three other team members to participate in this
ground-breaking polar expedition.</p>

<p>Jonathan Moody, Director of Greater West
Physiotherapy &amp; Health Centres, with 7 Physio and massage centres in
Sydney's West. Recently I engaged myself into a life long commitment into
discovering my self imposed limits. After running a marathon in September 2013,
I remembered thinking- I wish it had broken me, but it didn't. I never thought
I would have ever run a marathon and came to realise that all limitations are
self imposed. Anything is possible.</p>
<p>So I started getting unrealistic on my
limits. Everest? Lhotse? Badlands Ultra Marathon? They now all seem reachable.
 You see, the beauty about testing your limits, is that you don't need a
reason. You just do it for the sake of living. Experiencing the lows makes the
highs all that much better.</p>
<p>In setting out to start, I knew I needed
like minded people to explore the impossible with. Then came Charles. An email,
a phone call, an antarctic expedition, raising money for Leukaemia. Now that
means a whole lot.</p>
<p>Currently exploring my passion of writing
feature films and moving into the film industry, I thought I could combine
these two and be the Director/Writer/Producer of a documentary on the
expedition. A life worth living is one worth recording.</p>
<p>All we had to do was to build our
snow sailers and raise our sponsorship.</p>

<p>We successfully launched the Polar Challenge at the
ORA trade show in Sydney and the Explore Australia show, both of these were
held at the end of June.</p>
<p>By the end of October we had trialled our snow sailers,
finalised our dates of departure, built the snow sailers, secured all of our
product sponsorship and started raising our Corporate sponsorship for the
individual snow sailers.</p>
<p>The thought then occurred instead of finding a Major
Naming Rights sponsor, which would detract from our overall goal, why not take
this out to the world and offer the opportunity to be a part of this unique
adventure to you.</p>
<h2>So how you

<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The Outer Edge Polar Challenge team appreciates and
understands that the polar plateau – specifically the route to the<span>  Pole of Inaccessibility is highly remote,
with a fragile and untouched environment that requires careful and considerate
management.</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, the team understands that the expedition
must be fully self-sufficient throughout the expedition and only able to access
last resort resources from The Antarctic Company (TAC) such as Search and
Rescue and supply drops in the event of an emergency. We accept that there is
an inherent risk with the proposed expedition to such a remote and potentially
hazardous environment and have created a comprehensive risk management plan to
handle this.</p>
<p>The Outer Edge Polar Challenge Team takes safety very
seriously and recognises the inherent risks involved in a polar journey. As
such we have developed a plan to minimise, mitigate and manage the risks
associated with the proposed expedition.</p>
<p>The team leader has an extensive level of experience in
outdoor guiding and adventure travel over a period of seven years on
unsupported expeditions to the some of the worlds’ most extreme and unforgiving
natural environments. The team leader will ensure that the entire team is
trained to the same standard of independence and self-reliance in the field. </p>
<p>Team members are fit, well trained and
extremely capable outdoorsmen, capable of enduring long periods of inclement
conditions, and handling the severe cold conditions which can be expected on
the plateau.</p>
<p>This previous experience has built an
attitude and culture within the expedition team of cautious and well planned expeditioning. Whilst
we understand the inherent risks associated with the proposed expedition, we are committed
to intelligently managing the factors in our control as part of meticulously planning all aspects
of the expedition.</p>
<p>We will take a flexible approach to
the implementation of the expedition plan, assessing and taking into consideration weather conditions
and weather forecast, sastrugi, and team member’s condition on an ongoing basis, and
adapting our plans accordingly to ensure a safe and expeditious approach to the expedition.</p>
<p>This intelligent and calculated approach to
risk assessment and risk management has characterised the overall theme that we

<p>A full Risk Assessment and Management
Plan, which covers many of the conceivable risks and hazards that may be
encountered by the expedition has been formulated. Emergency Procedures have

</div></div>","Hi my name is Charles Werb, the founder of the Outer
Edge Polar Challenge ride for Leukaemia.


Whilst the dream to explore Antarctica only
manifested itself 4 years ago I can remember at the age of 24 doing some
drawings that showed a wind powered vehicle with Big Foot tyres for use on sand
or desert exploration.
For years I have played with wind powered “toys” be
they kites or sails and when the decision was made to go to Antarctica I
thought well why not something that has never been done before do? Let’s
attempt to sail around the Polar Plateau in a snow sailer.
Now this is something that you cannot just go and
buy from your local adventure retailer. In fact my research took me down the
path of ice sailers and some video on guys trying to use kite buggy’s with
skis. 
Whilst the ice sailers tracked impressively the buggy’s with skis could
not hold a straight line, they kept on having a side slip. It was then that I
had my first eureka moment…..Why not fit snowboards with ice blades attached
below like a keel and see what happens. Now I am not the first to do this, but
the method we used can be seen in the results we have produced to date.




So now I realised I had the vehicle, what about the
motivation? How am I going to do this. What do I need to put in place to make
this happen? The mind went into overdrive and then an opportunity presented
itself.
I bought Outer Edge Magazine. Not because of what it
had done in the market place but because of what I believed I could bring to
this publication - the opportunity to live my dream and to bring into it the
undertaking of a World First initiative. And the best part about this is that
our readers, sponsors and advertisers are all coming along for the ride.
Within 4 weeks of taking over Outer Edge Magazine my
Dad passed away after batting Lymphoma for 3 and 1/2 years. I had the opportunity
of confiding in him what I wanted to do, the great thing is that he immediately
understood what it was I wanted to do and my reasons why. 
4 weeks later Dad had
passed and on my way back from the funeral I made the decision to name the
event the Outer Edge Polar Challenge Ride for Leukaemia and dedicate in memory
of Henry Werb, Papa to all his grandchildren. 

  
This is our opportunity to involve others, to
inspire them to dream, to encourage them to explore and involve themselves in
science, technology and adventure and at the same time help others by raising
as much money as we can for the leukaemia Foundation.
So now we had a design, a mission, 2 great fellow
adventurers in Dr Adrian McCallum,expedition leader and Jon Moody videographer.



Dr Adrian McCallum is a
glaciologist who currently lectures in science & engineering at the
University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland; he manages courses in soil
mechanics, geotechnical engineering and climate change adaptation. He is
fortunate to have led a life of adventure and exploration around the globe and
is an expert in remote area science & engineering.
He holds a PhD from the
Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge and additional degrees
in oceanography, meteorology and civil engineering. In 2002 he was awarded the
Australian Centenary Medal for his stewardship of the 2001 Australian Army
Centenary Everest Expedition and he is a Menzies Scholar and Director of the
Menzies Foundation; a non-profit, non-political organisation created to promote
excellence in research, scholarship and postgraduate study by Australians.
During twenty years
service across the Australian Defence Forces he served in numerous diverse
roles such as helicopter navigator, meteorologist and civil engineer and he has
led or participated in adventurous scientific expeditions around the globe.
These investigations have taken him to many far-flung locations including
Svalbard, Greenland, across the Arctic and Antarctica, and to the Himalaya and
the ice caps of Patagonia. He orchestrated Sir Ranulph Fiennes' groundbreaking
2013 winter Transantarctic expedition and regularly consults to the Australian
Antarctic Division on polar infrastructural and operational matters.
There are a number of
reasons why Adrian is very excited to be involved with the Outer Edge Polar
Challenge.
Firstly, he is dedicated
to the pursuit of remote area scientific and engineering investigations,
particularly via lightweight and innovative means. The Outer Edge Polar
Challenge is a perfect exemplar of this concept: innovative, lightweight,
wind-propelled vehicles, crossing expanses of remote terrain whilst gathering
scientific data, in an intimate and efficient manner.
Adrian plans to tow an
ice penetrating radar behind his snowsailer, enabling ice thickness estimates
to be collected along the entire journey; much of the proposed route is over
ice of unknown extent, so these data will contribute greatly to literally ‘filling
in the blanks’. Additional science to be conducted on the traverse may include
instrumenting the snowsailers to monitor their condition whist traversing
thousand of miles of ice and snow and additionally, monitoring surface friction
and snow density along the route.
Even more important
than the scientific data that he expects to collect, Adrian is enthusiastic
about the vehicle that the expedition offers as a means to entice students into
a career in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM); that
being a scientist doesn’t have to mean wearing a lab coat, but can involve travelling
to anywhere in the world, gathering data that may otherwise be unobtainable,
unless combined with a little adventure…
Finally, with so many
families around the world affected by relatives and loved ones afflicted with Leukemia,
the opportunity to fly the flag in support of the Queensland Leukemia Foundation
and to assist in raising funds for ongoing Leukemia research is the primary factor
that drives Adrian and the three other team members to participate in this
ground-breaking polar expedition.

Its sleek design, mirroring that of the real deal, is made of durable yet lightweight, food grade plastic. The ThirstBat also features a sturdy grip at the handle, enabling that perfect swing or cover drive. The ThirstBat is so more than just a bat - it's a drinking vessel, perfect for holding and consuming your favourite cold beverage. Simply crack open your beverage using the in built bottle opener, and pour in your liquid goodness. The valve at the tip of the bat opens and closes to regulate the flow of the liquid. Position it to your mouth and smash that thirst! What sets ThirstBat apart is the custom designed valve, built in at the tip of the handle. With a simple twist to the left, the valve releases the liquid in a steady stream. Each bat also features a bottle opener. No teeth will be harmed in operating a ThirstBat!The ThirstBat will be available in two formats.

<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What type of valves can it inflate?</a></p>
<p>The RideAir is suitable for both types of valves (Presta as well as Schrader). In addition, you can use the RideAir with a ball inflating pump needle adapter in order to inflate basketball, football and etc.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What is the max PSI the RideAir can hold?</a></p>
<p>The RideAir can hold high pressure. The actual pressure that the RideAir will hold really depends on the air compressor that you will use in order to inflate the RideAir. From our experience the common air compressors outputs 145 PSI. We designed the RideAir to hold a much higher pressure though.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">How many tires can a fully compressed RideAir inflate?</a></p>
<p>a. There are two main variables that will determine that number: Tire size and width. <br/>b. There are two main scenarios that a cyclists usually encounter: (1) Reduced air pressure due to unused bike for couple of weeks. (2) Slow leakage of air due to puncture that will eventually cause a flat tire. In these cases, we need an emergency, highly pressured, inflation, so we could reach our final destination (return home safely, get on time to class or work, and even arrive less sweaty to a romantic date). The RideAir will help you manage both situations. <br/>For the number of Full tires the RideAir can provide, see table above.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What is the RideAir’s weight?</a></p>
<p>Around 1 pound, just like a full bicycle water bottle.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Is there a backup in case the pump loses air from that last time it was filled?</a></p>
<p>We designed the RideAir to keep the air inside the tank, without any leaks. The only thing that might affect the pressure inside the RideAir is the ambient temperature changes.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What’s the size of the RideAir?</a></p>

<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">How do I refill it?</a></p>
<p>You can use any air compressor out there! Simply adjust the air compressor to its maximum pressure (most air compressors could reach around 145 PSI or more), connect the compressor outlet tube to the RideAir's inlet valve and fill it up in seconds. It's that simple :)</p>

 THE SOLUTION
 
RideAir Saves you time, energy, and money. The perfect supply of air - Quick without the added frustration. 
 
 
Of course, RideAir has other great applications like helping you inflate lots of other stuff, too.
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 


 PLAY 



GET READY - Fill Your RideAir: Simply inflate the RideAir through its 'Inlet Valve' using any air-compressor out there (gas stations, bicycle shops, in house air compressors, etc.). Once it's fully inflated, the RideAir is all set and ready to go! 
GET SET - Carry It on Your Bike: The RideAir is equipped with a built-in 'Metal Cable Lock' and protected with a combination lock, that secures RideAirto your bicycle wherever you go. You can even use it to quickly lock-up your bike when at pit-stops. The RideAir is weighing just around a pound.  INFLATE! - Quickly and Easily Inflate Your Tire: When low air-pressure is encountered, whether from natural seepage or from a small puncture, simply connect the RideAir 'Inflation Tube' to your tire's inlet valve and quickly press the 'Inflation Button'. That's all. In a few seconds you're good to go! TheRideAir's 'PSI Gauge' will let you know exactly how much air is remaining in the capsule so that you can prepare in advance for the next use.    When used for regular maintenance of your tire's air pressure, a fully chargedRideAir could provide air requirements for more than a year without needing a refill!  RideAir's Inflation Tube is compatible with 'Schrader' inlet valves, but it also comes with a suitable adapter for 'Presta' valves! AIR TANK CAPACITYThe RideAir Can be filled with up to 300psi! It’s not likely that your local air compressor will go up to such a high psi so when it’s time to refill the RideAir set the compressor to the highest psi it will allow to put the most air in the tank, so you can fill more tire on the go... When RideAir is used to inflate a completely flat tire, the number of inflations possible from a fully-charged capsule changes according to the size of the tire. MEASUREMENTSThe RideAir is designed to perfectly fit any bicycle bottle holder in the market, and it's weighing just around a pound so you can carry it with you as you go! We put a lot of effort into RideAir's ergonomics and human-engineering, so anyone at any age could use it to inflate his tire on-the-go.  PRODUCT DESIGNThe RideAir is made of top of the line, lightweight materials for a long-lasting, waterproof and anti corrosive design. 
 
 

Combination Lock: RideAir has a built-in lock (4 feet long) with a combination-code, especially to keep your RideAir safely attached to your bike.

PSI Gauge: The RideAir is equipped with a PSI gauge that displays the current air-pressure in the RideAir Tank. That way you can always keep track of when a refill for your RideAir is required!
THE BENEFITS
 
 
Think of RideAir as the new inflation option on the block. From now on you have a new choice that offers a quick and easy solution for tire inflation that fits right in your hand or neatly on your bike...

<h2>Once upon a sunny but windy day...</h2>
<p><i>My name is Mike Bianchi and this idea came to me while on vacation with my wife.  With 3 kids at home we wanted to maximize our precious time away.  Wanting the most enjoyment, in the shortest amount of time, we decided to go to the beach on a 60+ degree sunny day.  The problem was that at the beach the wind was blowing too hard and it ruined our chances to enjoy a sunny day.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564936436/j2m6m9orkr5ytklb1m3r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>I then noticed the hotel had some beach chairs on their side protecting from the wind, and that’s where the idea came from.  As we flew home, I started to think about all the uses a wind screen would have.  For example, I value my alone time with my wife and it’s hard on a crowded beach but this screen would section space for us.  I could use less of my family complaining that “the sand is blowing on me, my towel keeps blowing, this is so annoying I'm trying to read, and I can’t hold the pages down.”  We love camping and fires, but it can get frustrating fast when there is a strong wind and everyone is depending on you to keep warm, and to cook food.</i></p>

<div>Life is tough enough without having to be frustrated while enjoying your vacation time no matter where you are, and having a little help blocking the elements makes for a more enjoyable experience for the family.  It’s an obvious solution to an obvious problem. I would love to know down the road that I helped increase enjoyment and valuable time no matter where people choose to go. In addition, if I can provide solely for my family and my wife can be at home with the kids as she had always imagined that would make it all worth it.</div>

</div></div>","Once upon a sunny but windy day...
My name is Mike Bianchi and this idea came to me while on vacation with my wife.  With 3 kids at home we wanted to maximize our precious time away.  Wanting the most enjoyment, in the shortest amount of time, we decided to go to the beach on a 60+ degree sunny day.  The problem was that at the beach the wind was blowing too hard and it ruined our chances to enjoy a sunny day.

I then noticed the hotel had some beach chairs on their side protecting from the wind, and that’s where the idea came from.  As we flew home, I started to think about all the uses a wind screen would have.  For example, I value my alone time with my wife and it’s hard on a crowded beach but this screen would section space for us.  I could use less of my family complaining that “the sand is blowing on me, my towel keeps blowing, this is so annoying I'm trying to read, and I can’t hold the pages down.”  We love camping and fires, but it can get frustrating fast when there is a strong wind and everyone is depending on you to keep warm, and to cook food.
The WINDSHEELD

It’s a beautiful sunny day and the family wants to go to the beach but it’s too windy? You’re enjoying time camping but the wind is blowing everything around?
Enter the WINDSHEELD. Use the world’s most durable wind barrier to relax with your family, and get peace of mind by blocking the wind elements from your area while at the beach or camping. This versatile, easy to use, retractable screen, is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts looking for privacy or sectioning an area for children or pets.  Built from cast aluminum and high grade nylon this portable solution is the both light-weight, tough, and easy to pack.
WINDSHEELD highlights:

Outdoors screen fence
Versatile for beach or camping
Privacy and sectioning divider 
Simple, easy to use and stow
Customizable with different colors, design, and corporate logos

Benefits for parents:
1.  Keep your young or pets safe and protected with this sectioning solution.2.  Extend the seasons by blocking some of that wind on sunny days3.  Avoid getting full of sand or having your stuff blow away from the wind

Life is tough enough without having to be frustrated while enjoying your vacation time no matter where you are, and having a little help blocking the elements makes for a more enjoyable experience for the family.  It’s an obvious solution to an obvious problem. I would love to know down the road that I helped increase enjoyment and valuable time no matter where people choose to go. In addition, if I can provide solely for my family and my wife can be at home with the kids as she had always imagined that would make it all worth it.

<h2>Why Scotland? Why Now?</h2>
<p><span>Scotland is known by many things: The beauty of its land, the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster, its culture, kilts, a famous drink known as scotch, and its Christian history. One thing that a lot of us don’t know is the current state of Christianity in Scotland. Scotland is currently on a decline in the area of Christianity. In 2001, 49% of people claimed to be part of the Protestant faith. On the other hand 27% of people claimed no religion at all. Fast forward to 2009/10, the number of those claiming no religion grew to 40% and those claiming to be of the Protestant faith fell to 41%. In 2011, the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey was released showing this: 51% of the population claimed no faith and those who are of the Protestant faith is around 32% now. </span></p>
<p><span>Why start my letter out with this information? Why the information overload? Well I want to give you a clear picture of why I’m writing this letter. Scotland is in a downward spiral, a crisis if you will. The Church has sounded the alarm and is focused on reaching the people who are becoming more secular year by year. The church is fighting against gang violence, poverty, and secularism and they desperately need the help of those around the world.</span></p>
<h2><span>How To Partner &amp; Help!</span></h2>
<p><span>There is currently an organization by the name of 20 Schemes, which is focused on planting 20 gospel centered churches in places known as Schemes; Schemes are government housing complexes (read projects) in Scotland. They firmly believe that true mercy ministry is to preach the gospel to those who have never heard it. They feel that all the gang violence and poverty is in direct relationship to the numbers I gave above. When the good news is cast aside and isn’t preached, the people will suffer. And this is why I have decided through much prayer to come alongside 20 Schemes.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been pursuing a position with 20 Schemes for the past 6 months and I have interviewed with them and was invited to a Vision Trip in Scotland in September of this year. This trip will determine if I spend the next two years in Scotland planting a church in one of Scotland’s poorest Schemes. This is why I’m writing; I wish to ask you to come alongside me and help reach Scotland’s poorest with the Good News of Christ Jesus. I’m currently attempting to raise $2500.00 to go to Scotland for this Vision Trip which will give me the opportunity to see these Schemes first hand and get closer to partnering in the mission of reaching the lost. </span></p>
<p><span>All financial support is greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, please spend time in prayer for Scotland, the church, and myself. The mission is a difficult one and we need brothers and sisters behind us praying for the lost to hear the truth with open hearts. If you wish to receive updates regarding my progress please continue to check in here. I cannot do this without the support and partnership of those God has placed around me. Thank you all for reading this long letter, lets reach the world together!</span></p>

<h3>What Will The Money Go Towards?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel to/from Scotland: I will be flying from the United States to Scotland September 5th. Tickets average around $1200 USD and up. Airfare may become more costly the closer I get to the date I'm leaving.</li>
<li>Travel in Scotland: I will most likely be visiting 3 cities while in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dundee) to get a broad view of what different types of Schemes in Scotland. Travel will be by train.</li>
<li>Room and Board while in the country.</li>
<li>All extra funds outside of these costs will be given directly to 20Schemes in support of planting the next church!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What If Goal Isn't Reached?</h3>
<p>If the goal of $2500 isn't reached, the money will still go towards offsetting costs for travel, room, &amp; board. I will still honor all perks as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If everything goes according to plan, I will be spending the next 2 years in Scotland assisting in planting/revitalizing a local church. This has the opportunity to bring the Word of God to thousands who are poor and stuck in a life of sin and bondage. Help us fulfill the great commission!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>
<p>Pray and Share! This is the some of the best help I can get. I need people getting the word out about 20Schemes and what they are attempting to accomplish. </p>

team, Fast Times, to Florida for the Championships. Every donor will get a
shout out on our website and Facebook Page to show our appreciation.  Donors of $25 or more will receive a premium
– from a SFV Roller Derby Sticker up to a pizza party at our place with us!  Any money we raise over our goal will be used
toward future travel. (We’ll be heading to Denver, CO in September.)  Every Dollar CountsThe Fast Times team has already traveled to Seattle, WA and Detroit, Michigan, among other cities. Travel costs add up quickly, especially when added to the the price of uniforms and gear. Just a set of wheels can run $50 or more and those are replaced a couple of times a year at minimum.  So, even the smallest donations will help ease the burden and get us to Daytona Beach, FL.Other Ways You Can HelpWe appreciate all donations, no matter how small, but if you're not

<p>My name is Ricardo Sanoja, I go by Antonio, and I am trying to become an Eagle Scout. But to do so, I need to first complete an Eagle Project, what this means is that I have to raise money and lead a group of people on some kind of, well, project that in some way helps the community.

But it also covers the wooden beams needed to support the sign ($95), the concrete that will keep it in the ground ($10), roofing to keep the sign dry ($60), special 8' screws ($1.50 each), wood stain ($8), paint ($21), printing maps, and a 10% overhead in the unlikely case that something goes wrong.</div>

So I'd like to help them, I'd like to help make their little park more official and give it the potential to do more with itself, an information board allows people to better understand what the place is, it allows General Motors to spread news to the park's patrons and it allows them to begin holding events there through the spread of information.

</div></figure></div></div>","Taskin is a young, San Francisco-based startup and there is nothing we love more than create amazing travel gear. We are super amped to introduce you to our latest creation!  
 You need a stylish, professional bag to take to work. This weekend, you need to fly to Dallas for your kid bother’s wedding, so you need a slightly larger backpack for your clothes and the gift (don’t forget the gift). Next up is your big vacay in Hawaii, so you need an even larger backpack for your all the stuff you’re bringing, and everything you’ll want to bring home.Sure, you could get three different backpacks. Or you could just one: The Taskin ONE 9-in-1 business and travel backpack.  Taskin design principles are anchored in combining style and quality with innovative function. And the Taskin ONE delivers on all 3 of these fundamentals in spades.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3 sizes x 3 configurations = 9 practical variations for infinite possibilities. Each variation is designed to meet a specific, real-world use case. Spoiler alert: It’s also far more practical than buying a different bag for each. Especially when you get it all with Taskin quality and style. 
  Carry-on Like Packing  But you can fit a lot more while staying far more organized. 
  Pop-in/Pop-out Backpack Straps Extra wide backpack straps with honeycomb padding that can be neatly hidden behind butterfly flaps, what more can you ask for!  TSA Friendly Laptop SleeveTSA/Checkpoint friendly 180° lay flat design allows you to breeze through airport security.. well at least compared to the others.  
  OrganizationBet the Taskin One has more organization options then all the backpacks you own combined :).  Just having more pockets is obviously not enough, so we put in a lot of thought and experimentation into designing the most optimal configuration that will get you the most use out of these pockets. 
 
 
 
 4-Point, Self-Balancing Shoulder StrapsExtra wide shoulder straps that with honeycomb mesh padding featuring our unique self balancing 4 point anchor system. No matter how you like to wear your shoulder bag the straps will re-balance to keep your bag in a comfortable-balanced position. Stove-away Water Bottle PocketsNow you see it, now you don't. A neat hideable mesh water bottom pocket when you need one.  Carry-on AttachmentLugging around a carry-on, well then let it do the heavy lifting with this special carry-on attachment, which secures the One to most standard carry-on handles.  Easy-hide Compression StrapsCompression straps that hidden when not in use. Also doubles as an attachment to pretty much anything bulky, like a tripod stands.  Adjustable Sternum StrapsEasily adjustable sternum straps ensure maximum comfort, not matter how big or small you chest size. Sunglass Pocket w/ Velvet LiningVelvet lined easy access pocket to store you sunglasses or other essentials.    Waterproof External ZippersCustom made easy-slide waterproof zippers to help keep the water out (while ONE is water resistant, it is not waterproof, no bag with stitches are) while being easier to pull open. Adjustable Side Handles /w Magnetic WrapsMagnetic wraps allow to easily separate the two ends as compared to pulling apart velcro, are a lot more durable as well.. and cooler. The length of the handles can be adjusted depending on the bags expansion level.  Neoprene Cushioned Top HandleThe top handle is made of neoprene so it easy on your hands a stays clean. Neoprene is also very durable.  Unisex DesignWill look great on you and your significant other, so make sure you get 2 of these beauties!  
 
 We had a backpacker go on a 10 day trip to incredible New Zealand with just the ONE as his only bag. Was it a bit extreme, absolutely, but like they say, proof is in the pudding:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/B92fPo1.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Despite the technologically advanced society we live in, there are some objects that have yet to be digitised for our travel. Either that, or the benefits of carrying them physically greatly outweighs carrying them digitally, since you can never be sure about the accessibility to technology while overseas. Some examples of these objects include: your cash, tickets, brochures, postcards and cards. These items often reduce the quality of our experience as we fumble and tumble to look for them in our bags.</p>
<p>As travellers, we empathise with the frustration with the lack of organisation of the miscellaneous travel essentials - cash, travel tickets, receipts, documents etc. Hence, we decided to formulate a solution for a traveller's most common problem - the travel clutter. A lot of time and effort has been pumped into the project, and we hope that daypocket will be a product that makes a difference to people who face this particular problem. Also, we hope that daypocket will inspire people to look at the conventional notebook in a new light. </p>

<p>Daypocket is a book of pockets that helps you organize your travel miscellaneous prior and during your trip.</p>
<h3>A PEEK INTO THE POCKETS</h3>

<p>Daypocket has 3 pockets of different sizes, designed to cater to your small travel essentials.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482164995/v6jkfrun28c4gf9muqdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>YOUR SECURITY, OUR PRIORITY</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/O56uHoO.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Not only is it easy to slip your travel documents into the pockets, it is also extremely secure. Our pockets are designed around the idea that the strongest point of the book would be nearer to the bind itself; the pockets are also facing inwards. Have a peace of mind for you won't have to worry about the contents falling out.</p>
<h3>PEN 'EM DOWN</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482118902/s585h7gubmbvynfw2jfu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Made of paper produced by a company that is certified responsible forestry and promotes sustainable forest management. Simply plan your itinerary and label your pockets directly on them, no extra tabs needed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482132777/fvcxmakpbobxy02eafpz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Daypocket also encourages creativity - just draw and sketch on them if you see anything interesting along the way, or if you are just bored and want something to doodle on.</p>
<h3>THE PERFECT BIND</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/vjPTGFr.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Bound by a band, every single page is detacheable, and re-attacheable. </p>
<h3>MAKE IT YOURS</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/clZ8uFU.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Customise your book according to the length of your trip. 7 days trip? 7 Pages into the book. 14 days trip? 14 pages in. Easy.</p>
<h3>LAY IT FLAT</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482135462/k0c8smnk9b1le3selwdp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ever feel the discomfort when writing on books that cannot be laid completely flat? Fret not, Daypocket lies completely flat when opened up. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482141178/kq7xg1vm4lwaiu6ko7wq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since every page is detachable, you can even bring the page to the front and use the book cover as a backing to write on. </p>
<h3>RAINY DAY? NO FEAR.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/0xgbMMg.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Water-repellant fabric is used for Daypocket's cover - just in case your pages of pockets get wet on rainy days. </p>
<h3>THE SWEET SPOT</h3>

<p>Just a little bonus, there's even a slot for you to carry your pen!</p>

<p>Daypocket is the perfect book for you to bring on your travel and a little bigger than A5.</p>
<h3>BEYOND TRAVEL</h3>

<p>Though a seemingly easy idea, we went through many rounds of considerations. We looked at materials, the binding, users' needs, and the smallest details.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/h3Mh098.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>After countless prototypes, we are proud to present our final design of daypocket to you.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Daypocket is the brainchild of a very dedicated team. A lot of time and effort has been pumped into the project, and we cannot be any more excited to share what we have created with you.</p>
<p>The main challenge we dealt with during this journey would be the designing process of the pockets. Every detail is critical, from the size of the pockets, to the orientation of the pockets on each page, to the material. Our goal? To make them the most intuitive for users.</p>
<p>Post funding, we will continue to look into the materials used for daypocket. We are constantly looking for alternative paper to reduce the thickness of daypocket, but we assure you that we will always consider the environmentally friendly factor before making decisions. We promise to keep you updated with our journey and should there be any delay in the delivery, you will definitely be the first to know.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
Despite the technologically advanced society we live in, there are some objects that have yet to be digitised for our travel. Either that, or the benefits of carrying them physically greatly outweighs carrying them digitally, since you can never be sure about the accessibility to technology while overseas. Some examples of these objects include: your cash, tickets, brochures, postcards and cards. These items often reduce the quality of our experience as we fumble and tumble to look for them in our bags.
As travellers, we empathise with the frustration with the lack of organisation of the miscellaneous travel essentials - cash, travel tickets, receipts, documents etc. Hence, we decided to formulate a solution for a traveller's most common problem - the travel clutter. A lot of time and effort has been pumped into the project, and we hope that daypocket will be a product that makes a difference to people who face this particular problem. Also, we hope that daypocket will inspire people to look at the conventional notebook in a new light. 
 

MEET DAYPOCKET

Daypocket is a book of pockets that helps you organize your travel miscellaneous prior and during your trip.
A PEEK INTO THE POCKETS
 

Daypocket has 3 pockets of different sizes, designed to cater to your small travel essentials.

 
YOUR SECURITY, OUR PRIORITY
 
Not only is it easy to slip your travel documents into the pockets, it is also extremely secure. Our pockets are designed around the idea that the strongest point of the book would be nearer to the bind itself; the pockets are also facing inwards. Have a peace of mind for you won't have to worry about the contents falling out.
PEN 'EM DOWN

Made of paper produced by a company that is certified responsible forestry and promotes sustainable forest management. Simply plan your itinerary and label your pockets directly on them, no extra tabs needed.

Daypocket also encourages creativity - just draw and sketch on them if you see anything interesting along the way, or if you are just bored and want something to doodle on.
THE PERFECT BIND
 
Bound by a band, every single page is detacheable, and re-attacheable. 
MAKE IT YOURS
 
Customise your book according to the length of your trip. 7 days trip? 7 Pages into the book. 14 days trip? 14 pages in. Easy.
LAY IT FLAT

Ever feel the discomfort when writing on books that cannot be laid completely flat? Fret not, Daypocket lies completely flat when opened up. 

Since every page is detachable, you can even bring the page to the front and use the book cover as a backing to write on. 
RAINY DAY? NO FEAR.
 
Water-repellant fabric is used for Daypocket's cover - just in case your pages of pockets get wet on rainy days. 
THE SWEET SPOT
 
Just a little bonus, there's even a slot for you to carry your pen!
HANDY AND COMPACT

Daypocket is the perfect book for you to bring on your travel and a little bigger than A5.
BEYOND TRAVEL
 
Think daypocket is only suited for travel? Think again. Daypocket is more than just for travel. Use it for your daily/weekly/monthly budgeting, collection of ideas or even planning of events.
DAYPOCKET's COLOURS

Burnt Umber

Ash Grey

Ivory Black
THE PROCESS

Though a seemingly easy idea, we went through many rounds of considerations. We looked at materials, the binding, users' needs, and the smallest details.
 
After countless prototypes, we are proud to present our final design of daypocket to you.

Risks & Challenges
Daypocket is the brainchild of a very dedicated team. A lot of time and effort has been pumped into the project, and we cannot be any more excited to share what we have created with you.
The main challenge we dealt with during this journey would be the designing process of the pockets. Every detail is critical, from the size of the pockets, to the orientation of the pockets on each page, to the material. Our goal? To make them the most intuitive for users.
Post funding, we will continue to look into the materials used for daypocket. We are constantly looking for alternative paper to reduce the thickness of daypocket, but we assure you that we will always consider the environmentally friendly factor before making decisions. We promise to keep you updated with our journey and should there be any delay in the delivery, you will definitely be the first to know.

Rocket Hanger is a folding kids' hanger engineered and designed to look better, feel better, and perform better. It can be used in all conditions.
Two sets purchased = One set donated.
(Every Kid or family need hanger, it looks small and easy for most of us, however, we believe that there are some kids or families still waiting for the help. So, let's try our best!)



There is no innovation in the Kids' hanger industry, maybe people think it is small thing as a small product. But we re-imagined what a kids' hanger should be:


Be attractive and funny to kids 
Easy to use
Protect the clothes



What is the shipping cost to U.S.?
        It is FREE SHIPPING to U.S. and only available through Indiegogo !!!


Do you ship internationally? What is the shipping cost?
        Yes, we do global shipment, please add $15 as shipping cost


When do you start delivery?
         Your perk will be delivered within 1 week from the end of this campaign.









We know that not everyone can contribute financially.  However, sharing our campaign with others would be immensely helpful.If you have kids, nieces/nephews, friends with kids, etc. please support our campaign by giving the gift of Rocket Hanger to the little ones in your lives.
Thank you for your continued support. It's been invaluable to Rocket all along the way. We wouldn't be where we are without you.




One set = 8 Rocket Hangers + 1 Multifunctional Rocket Box




Use your Rocket Box



Bonus!!!







Rocket Hanger is our first product and we hope you can support on our dream. We focus on the kids' lives, so want to make more innovative products for them. Your contribution will be used design and manufacturing new surprise!!

We need $15,000 to start the research and design of NEW ROCKET

Any additional funds that we raise will go toward marketing and the roll-out of the Rocket brand. This is for getting more voice from kids and parents.
If we don't reach our goal (sad face) we will still continue to that work, however, it will be more difficult and longer time without your support - but let's not talk about that 

What's in next ?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am a high school student in Charlottesville, Virginia, and I want to help the unfortunate people of Haiti through volunteer work.  Early this summer, I will embark on a journey with my father to Thomassin, Haiti.  In collaboration with the Building Goodness Foundation and a group of local Haitians, we will build the Excelsior Technical Institute.  This is a trade school in Thomassin that will teach the population the skills they need to build a community damaged by natural disasters and poverty.  Help us to help them help their nation!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Excelsior Technical Institute will have a huge impact on Thomassin both during construction and upon completion.  Local Haitians will be integral to its construction, and the trade school itself will teach current and future generations the skills they need to excel in their community.  I am proud to be helping in the betterment of an impoverished community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this trip, I will need a total of $1,700.  My father will be partially funded by the Building Goodness Foundation because he is a skilled carpenter.  The breakdown is as follows: for travel, we will need approximately $900; for food and lodging, $600; for transfers and taxes, $90; for vaccinations, $110 (My father has already gotten his vaccinations as he went to Haiti in 2011).  If we don't reach our final goal, the money will still go towards paying for the trip.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Westhollow Society is a non-profit that exists to help improve and give identity to the Northwest Dallas communities through beautification, culture, and community.</p>
<p>We need signage on the Park Forest neighborhood to promote a brand and identity that currently does not exist for Park Forest.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need approximately $2600 to install all of the signs (the cost for installation is about $1000) and to manufacture the signs (the cost for making them is about $1600). The remainder is used to pay fees taken by indigogo and PayPal (about 4% and PayPal 4%).</p>
<p><strong>If we do not reach our entire goal, no funds will be retained.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I began researching the costs involved in getting street signs for Park Forest about a year or so ago. I got quotes and counted and listed all of the needed signage for street sign toppers in the neighborhood. It would only cost about $11/household for there to be street signs at the top of every intersection in our neighborhood and entry to our neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>IF WE DO NOT RAISE ALL OF THE FUNDS, ALL FUNDS PLEDGED WILL BE REFUNDED BY INDIEGOGO.   FUNDS CHARGED WILL BE KEPT ONLY IF WE REACH THE NEEDED FUNDS TO PURCHASE THE SIGNS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any funds that remain after purchasing and installing the signs and paying fees will be donated to the Park Forest Crime Watch organization by Westhollow Society.  </strong></p>
<h3>The Sign </h3>
<p>I designed the sign and I think it differentiates our neighborhood from those around us. We have a mid-century neighborhood and primarily ranches/etc. from that era. I think this captures the era and gives our neighborhood an ""identity"" and ""Brand"" that we currently do no posses</p>
<p>It is shaped like a mid century ranch with a chimney at the top with the development established date. It's better than the typical boring oval or square signs you may see (like in Northaven Park across Marsh) etc. Also, it is something people will remember seeing and that will be associated in their minds with Park Forest.   It will help people to know where Park Forest is and ""put it on the map"" so to speak. It will help to raise its cache among the city residents as well.</p>
<p>I have already had it approved by the City of Dallas streets department, so we only need to have them made to move forward.</p>

<h3>MINIMAL DESIGN</h3> <p></p>Pen Uno is a most minimal pen designed to be both a pleasure to write with and beautiful to see. With only 5.3mm (7/32in) in diameter it is one of the slimmest pens ever manufactured, yet it is very comfortable to use because its holding barrel is slightly wider. This barrel also serves as a twisting cap that protects the pen tip when not in use. Pen Uno is precision-machined out of space-grade aluminum and anodized in four distinct colors: space grey, silver, gold, and rose gold. A fifth exclusive color in black is also available at certain reward levels.<p></p> </div><div>

This cartridge writes exactly the same as the regular Hi-Tec-C cartridge but it is much slimmer in diameter because it was designed for a multi-color pen system. Taking advantage of this super slim cartridge we were able to construct what we believe is one of the most minimal pens ever designed.<br/>

<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3>
<div>
<p>We have been working on this pen for more than a year. Through this time we have pinned down every design detail and manufacturing process. We have produced tens of prototypes which have helped us to better understand every aspect of the product. The pen is now ready for production and we have secured a top of the line manufacturer that specializes in precision metal components.</p>
<p>Our main challenge is to achieve our funding goal and be able to place our first production order. Your help is essential and we will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions. We are looking forward to creating this pen for you!</p>

</div></div>","MINIMAL DESIGN Pen Uno is a most minimal pen designed to be both a pleasure to write with and beautiful to see. With only 5.3mm (7/32in) in diameter it is one of the slimmest pens ever manufactured, yet it is very comfortable to use because its holding barrel is slightly wider. This barrel also serves as a twisting cap that protects the pen tip when not in use. Pen Uno is precision-machined out of space-grade aluminum and anodized in four distinct colors: space grey, silver, gold, and rose gold. A fifth exclusive color in black is also available at certain reward levels. 
Pen Uno uses the widely available Hi-Tec-C Coleto gel ink cartridge. This cartridge writes exactly the same as the regular Hi-Tec-C cartridge but it is much slimmer in diameter because it was designed for a multi-color pen system. Taking advantage of this super slim cartridge we were able to construct what we believe is one of the most minimal pens ever designed.
  WRITING EXPERIENCE In this video we show how the pen writes and the overall writing experience. 

  MECHANISM The holding barrel doubles as twisting cap to protect the pen tip when not in use. A few turns of the cap will reveal the pen to be ready to write. 
When not in use you can close the twisting cap to protect the tip.


COLORS
Pen Uno is anodized in five subtle and elegant colors (dark grey, gold, silver, rose gold, and red). A special edition pen in black will be included when you get four pens.

<p>The best products are created by inventors to solve a problem they face themselves, and our ‘Chill’ products are no different. Here’s our story about how we came up with the idea for The Chiller, The Chiller’s Pack and The Chiller’s Tote.</p>
<p>From our extensive experience enjoying drinks outdoors, we noticed a persistent problem that everyone experiences - too many beverage cooling options with one big melting ingredient... ice. ""Carry a bulky cooler, and fill it with frozen water,"" they said. ""Get two bags of ice because they will be half melted by the time you load the cooler,"" they said.</p>
<p>We had enough of struggling with and watching others struggle with bulky coolers. So we decided to re-invent portable cooling. The Chiller was our breakthrough - it is easily transportable on any adventure and provides all of the comforts of a nice cold one without any of the hassle. Now you can say goodbye to your heavy ice chest and melted ice (Rest In Puddle!).</p>
<p>So be free to pursue the chillest vibes and enjoy the coldest drinks, no matter how formidable the terrain may be. Wherever your day takes you - from sunny beaches to mountain trails to golf courses or grassy parks - you deserve to have a nice cold one whenever and wherever you want it. Cheers!</p>

<p>Chill.Systems was founded out of ‘necessity’ by a pair of weekend enthusiasts, Chase and Brian. We became friends in college at the University of Southern California, working together at a safe-ride service and pursuing business degrees. We moved to San Francisco in 2014, becoming roommates and beginning our careers - Chase in sales at Google and Brian in finance at Apple.</p>
<p>In 2016 we attended a BYOB music festival in San Francisco, and couldn’t help but notice people struggling with traditional coolers. We thought there had to be a better way to chill on the go - and that night the idea for Chill.Systems was born. We went through many rounds of prototypes to perfect The Chiller, and developed The Chiller’s Packs to enhance its’ cooling power and portability. With our system, you can now enjoy your favorite beverage, cold, and on the go. It’s hassle-free and best of all, ice-free! We can’t wait for you to try it for yourself!</p>

Say goodbye to ice runs! The Chiller packs freezing gel inside its walls, creating an icy chamber around your beverages.
The Chiller’s Pack, Tote, or Pack Plus, paired with The Chiller, is your ultraportable beverage cooling system. Avoid the inevitability of melting ice so you can enjoy all of life’s greatest adventures.
 




 

 

 

 
Cool your room temperature drinks without the use of ice; The Chiller cools your favorite drinks up to 20 degrees per hour. When used with The Chiller’s Pack, The Chiller can keep your drinks cold for up to 24 hours.
Save time and money — never stop at the store for ice to fill your cooler again. Purchase The Chiller’s Pack just once, and it pays for itself!
 

 

 
The Chiller can hold your favorite drinks such as beer cans, soda cans, beer bottles, wine bottles and spirits.
Each Chiller fits three cans/bottles or one 750 ml to 1L wine or spirit bottle at a time.
*For advanced chilling, add new drinks to The Chiller as you consume them.
 

 

 
The Chiller’s Pack is smaller than most backpack coolers, making it the ultimate portable beverage cooling system for all of your favorite outdoor adventures.
The Chiller weighs just 3.2 lbs., and The Chiller’s Pack weighs just 1.5 lbs.
 

 

 
The Chiller’s Pack comes with top and back access, as well as a front zip compartment and side drink holders. It’s designed to transport a Chiller plus a 6-pack of cans or 3 bottles of wine. You can load bottles from the top and cans from the side, so you’re ready for whatever life throws at you.

I want to make personal connections that may end up lasting a lifetime, and share those connections and stories with all of backers and supporters.  My blog can be seen at: http://maxandhismiatatakearoadtrip.wordpress.com/Previous photos I've taken can be seen at:https://www.flickr.com/photos/maxkarg/sets/And to learn more about me, you can visit: http://about.me/Max_Karg",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

When any unexpected braking or impact is detected, the Dash will automatically create a video recording that starts from 5 seconds before the incident even occurred.
30 Day Standby When Parked With the VAVA Dash Cam Charger

<p>While whole beans can be stored for a much longer period of time - oxidation, moisture and CO2 Depletion are only few of the many reasons why fresh grounds go stale in a very short amount of time. So keep it fresh as much as possible to have that original, rewarding flavor.</p>

It’s only about the size of a bottle of water, which means you can take it anywhere easily, whether on business trips, camping trips, or even backpacking out in the wilderness.
 

At 150 lumens, LUME provides plenty of light to read by or light your way to the campfire or get up in the middle of the night to...you get the idea. It provides about 20 hours of illumination on a single charge.

But how did we get here?



While whole beans can be stored for a much longer period of time - oxidation, moisture and CO2 Depletion are only few of the many reasons why fresh grounds go stale in a very short amount of time. So keep it fresh as much as possible to have that original, rewarding flavor.
Then, you'll need beans that are ground into particles of consistent size. Now the word “consistent” is key here. Why?

When you roast potatoes, you want to cut each chunk the same size to make sure they’re cooked evenly. None overcooked, none undercooked.

For example, if you like the french press brewing method, we recommend against super fine grounds. While coarse particles get good extraction, fine particles will be over-extracted. That means a bitter tasting cup of coffee.
Most of today’s hand grinders generally have one major flaw - the burr isn’t stabilized. It rocks back and forth, creating some particles larger than the rest.LUME grinder, on the other hand, uses a patent-pending design, that applies a stabilized conical ceramic burr to keep everything precise and even.You’ll get the same quality grounds you get from your favorite coffee shop.The grounds that LUME produces can be adjusted for size, but they always deliver your favorite beans the way you want them — full of rewarding flavor.And that's LUME.Here is a breakdown of what you'll get from your pledge. We've kept it simple and you'll get great savings from retail price - just to thank you for your support.We started this journey more than 18 months ago and the first working prototype was successfully produced about 7 months ago. There are heaps of sweat, labor and most importantly, heart going into the LUME project. After rounds and rounds of testing and improvement LUME is finally ready for the world! LUME was created by a team of award-winning designers, engineers, operators and other professionals. We’ve spent a lot of time planning this launch.

But the only way to make a comfy place even better is by adding warmth. This is why we've taken it upon ourselves to find something that will provide you the comforts of home. Even when you are far away.WORRY NO MOREDÄCKE - Odour, tear, stain and water resistantWe don't want you to worry about anything when enjoying the great outdoors. And with DÄCKE you won't have to. We use a synthetic siliconized fiber for its insulation. Each DÄCKE ist treated with a durable water repellent. Water will splash right off and stains can be brushed away. Extra durable nylon ensure that no tears or holes will ruin your blanket. Fiber Siliconized Synthetic InsulationWe use a custom type of synthetic insulation. This means DÄCKE is free from any down sourced from animals and unlike its counterpart the hollow fibers will not lose their insulating properties. Even when wet. Warmer than your sleeping bagWe used a whopping 240q/sqm of fill weight. This means DÄCKE will be warmer than many high profile sleeping bags out there but still be as portable and packable. So you can take it anywhere. Attach it anywhereWe've included four corner loops. Wanna use it as an underquilt, stake it down or hang it up to dry? Now you can. A special kind of beautyFunction should come with form. We believe in the aestethics of nature and have modeled DÄCKE after it. Inspired by the northern lights it'll not only make you look good but also be stunning by itself. BORN IN GERMANY - AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE
HÄNG - Developing outdoor gear since 2014Founded in Germany six years ago we’ve started out by manufacturing ultralight camping hammocks and delivered our product to thousands of happy customers in over forty countries. Sustainable fabricsOur partners do hold both, a Bluesign and an Öko-Text 100 certificate. This ensures that all goods are produced using only the most eco-friendly textiles. We are striving to ensure that all need for harsh chemicals and unsustainable substances during the entire process is eliminated. Striving for safety. A filling made entirely from recyclable materialsThe siliconized fiber insulation that we will bis using in the production of DÄCKE is made entirely out of waste and scraps that will therefor be kept out of landfills. We are striving to use a ripstop nylon that will be made from 100% recycled material as well. EST. 2014 Outdoors at homeThis is us. The faces behind HÄNG. Founded in 2014 by Tobi and joined a little while later by Vincent we have been pushing the boundaries when it comes to hammocks made from parachute nylon. Since we'd love a good hang year round we were wondering why high-tech outdoor textiles haven't really been used for everyday objects. So we got to work.

<p>I've always been an adventurous and active soul that can’t quite commit to having my feet in one place. Having travelled for years and worked in the travel and sporting industry, the idea stemmed from the necessity to have a versatile and beautiful towel that could be used for every activity. Personal style has always been important to me and I've combined that with the functionality and versatility of the outdoors. </p>
<p>SomerSide was created as a more sustainable product to keep plastic out of our oceans and forests. I took up surfing whilst living in Bali, and I quickly noticed how polluted the water was with plastic, it was everywhere. It hit me- literally. I've been hit by nappies, plastic cups, a bag caught on my foot and even have a small scar on my ankle from a sharp piece of rubbish that hit me in the water.  Protecting our environment is very important to SomerSide and myself and we will constantly strive to implement sustainable practices in everything we do. SomerSide is about doing more while using less. </p>
<p>Thank you for support!</p>

<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Unlike a lot of campaigns, we've put countless hours and our savings into manufacturing and testing SomerSide.

Carry only the essentials to the beach, perfect for surfers who worry about where to put their key when they're out in the water.You can also put sunscreen, spare bather bottoms, lip balm, a small snack- the essentials and moreNot a fan of microfibre towels because they often feel like you're drying yourself with paper? SomerSide towels have been designed to be soft against your skin so you can enjoy using it like any other towel.

Estimated delivery is end of January/start of February. We've already invested into ordering and trialing and so we have a relationship with our manufacturer and have worked with them to create this timeline.


FREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ. You can add on a large or an XL to your chosen Perk at checkout! Special deals available for Indiegogo ONLY

Not the number or combination of towels you are looking for even with the add-ons? No problems we can add them on manually. Please send us an email at support@somerside.com.au with the subject line 'Custom Perk' and we will get back to you ASAP! Expect a response within 24 hours. We want to make sure we deliver your order correctly and so we need to make note of all custom orders. 

FREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ
Our Indiegogo special offers free shipping to certain destinations, check the reward table above. 
Our shipping base is located in Melbourne, Australia and will be mailed out from there. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. Aus Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days. We are a small business and unfortunately cannot offer free worldwide shipping for all rewards at this point in time but we can offer you a great product at an excellent discount. 
CUSTOM DUTIES AND TAX
Cannot mark as gift, this is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.
Our terms of sale for international orders are FOB Destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. 


I've always been an adventurous and active soul that can’t quite commit to having my feet in one place. Having travelled for years and worked in the travel and sporting industry, the idea stemmed from the necessity to have a versatile and beautiful towel that could be used for every activity. Personal style has always been important to me and I've combined that with the functionality and versatility of the outdoors. 
SomerSide was created as a more sustainable product to keep plastic out of our oceans and forests. I took up surfing whilst living in Bali, and I quickly noticed how polluted the water was with plastic, it was everywhere. It hit me- literally. I've been hit by nappies, plastic cups, a bag caught on my foot and even have a small scar on my ankle from a sharp piece of rubbish that hit me in the water.  Protecting our environment is very important to SomerSide and myself and we will constantly strive to implement sustainable practices in everything we do. SomerSide is about doing more while using less. 
Thank you for support!
Gabriella Samkova

These include unforseen shipping delays, problems in our factory partners, government shutdowns, and more. We promise to do our best to keep our customers updated with the progress and satisfied with the final product.

The check-in's large interior volume of 86L (expandable up to 96L) can easily fit enough items for a 10+ day trip. It also has multiple compartments and external pouches so you can keep your items organized and easily access your valuables.




 
The Office
An everyday commuter companion bag that can also function as a spacious carry-on, the Office has multiple organizational compartments letting you easily access your essential items. We merged a traditional office bag with G-RO’s signature large, space saving, tough-terrain wheels to create the perfect bag for your daily commute or weekend adventure.   



 
The Backpack XV
A utility-style backpack elevated to a sophisticated travel companion for the everyday explorer. Durable construction, intuitively designed features, internal and external charging all combine to offer a backpack with next level performance for the daily commuter and weekend adventurer.



 
The Backpack Light
An elegantly designed, compact backpack that comes loaded with unique minimalist features designed to organize your valuables, give you instant access to your essentials and keep your devices safe and synced.



Materials
Ultra-Durable Ballistic Nylon
After designing the original G-RO carry-on from ballistic nylon, we created the Check-In from the same durable, water-resistant material.
630D Nylon
Flexible and lightweight, the 630D nylon was the perfect material to craft the standard Backpack Light with.
Stingrey Polyblend
After investigating different fabrics to add to the G-RO family our engineers created water-resistant polyblend that's lightweight and as fashionable as it is durable.
Smart Electronics
 
TILE
We're very excited to let you know that all G-RO products offered in this campaign will come with a TILE Slim Bluetooth Tracker. Small and compact, it works with a dedicated app that connects you to Tile, the largest lost-and-found community in the world.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Paul Spencer and I'm an extreme athlete. For years I've had a dream of riding my bike around the world. In 2020, I'll be leaving to break the Guinness World Record of <i>Fastest Human-Powered Circumnavigation of the Globe</i>. I'll be raising awareness for self-propelled transport, electric-powered vehicles and the <a href=""https://www.lupus.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lupus Foundation</a> along the way. I want this to be a collaborative adventure. Besides helping me fund this trip, you're invited to join me anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm planning the trip and concentrating on building a one-of-a-kind boat through <a href=""http://www.lomocean.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lomocean Designs</a> and an innovative pedal propulsion system. </p>

It's engineered to protect your gear and keep you looking good while doing it.It's super-functional, cut-proof and is even fireproof. Wait, what? Yes, that's right. It's lined with a mid-layer of fireproof fabric made to protect in the event of a lithium battery fire. Just a little something extra.  The Bravo X comes with various anti-theft elements, to keep you safe from pickpockets, is packed with convenient travel features such as an external USB port that can also hold a SIM card and pin, and it's equipped with water-resistant materials, made to keep your gear dry.And if that weren't enough, it also comes with optional modular features. Intrigued? Scroll down for more ;)  The fireproof fabric is graphene-coated and is fireproof up to 2000 degrees. The Bravo X Sling comes in 3 different high-quality fabrics. Made from 80% Nylon & 20% Polyester, this sleek looking material feels like wool but is highly abrasion-resistant & easy to clean. Used in the Graphite Grey version. Ballistic Nylon is one of the most durable technical fabrics out there and is slightly hydrophobic, meaning it won't absorb water easily. It also has high abrasion-resistance. Used in the Jet Black version.Both the FauxWool & Ballistic Nylon versions come with a mid-layer of Kevlar that is 5 times stronger than steel. Ultra-High Molecular-Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a fabric that has a very high resistance to tearing and is used in our cutproof bags. Kevlar is not used in combination with this fabric. Used in Charcoal Black & Ash Grey versions.One of the best features of this bag is the modular accessories. Ever find yourself looking for a place to store your sunnies but end putting them over your head or on your shirt? Or how about trying to find that access card or transport card? Carry your coins in your pocket?These modular add-ons will make these problems be a thing of the past. The stabiliser strap included with the bag comes with a magnetic adapter that is compatible with our modular accessories. Move from bag to strap in a second. The UP Passport Holder is a great add on to the Bravo X Sling. It is a 100% zero waste product that is made entirely from up-cycled materials. We used the by-product materials (that would normally be discarded) from our bags and repurpose them to create a new product: UP Passport Holder - a slim, sustainable and functional passport holder with RFID protection. WE ARE ALPAKAOur mantra is to keep moving forward.

<h3>Risk and Challenges</h3>
<div>
<p>We have lined up valuable and expert partners that will be involved in important areas of product development and manufacturing. The prototypes we have produced have helped us confirm that we can manage risks associated to their development and production. <br/></p>
<p><b>Supply Chain</b></p>
<p>We reduced the number of parts required to manufacture the smrtGRiPS by choosing high quality and  highly integrated components.  By doing so,  we believe that we have reduced our exposure to delays that could potentially occur by longer than expected lead times.</p>
<p><b>Crowdsourced Design: Making it Perfect</b><br/></p>
<p>As soon as the campaign gets going, we will be looking into what our backers have to say regarding the final design.  We have included this step in our production process so you can help us create you the best smrtGRiPS ever. We believe that your contribution will  maximize your ROI (Return On Investment). There is nothing more valuable than having a product that you really want. </p>
<p><b>The Great Outdoors</b></p>
<p>smrtGRiPs are designed to  work in the most extreme weather conditions, and even under water (10m). Once we are certain that the smrtGRiPS can perform as expected in severe weather conditions, we will initiate pre-production. We accounted for testing in our schedule. Our first pre-production samples will be submitted to a battery of tests. It's difficult to predict the exact outcome. It is a possibility that testing may take longer than expected, in order to make the modifications needed to reach the standards we are aiming for. </p>
<p><b>The Litmus Test: Certification </b></p>
<p>Following the pre-production run, the smrtGRiPs will undergo all the necessary steps for certification. These are the the governing bodies’ mandatory requirements  that we must comply with in order to ship to the different countries. These tests will need to happen before delivering smrtGRiPs to our backers. Even though several of our team members are well versed in these requirements, there is a risk that we may face delays in the eventuality that some of the components parts have to be reworked or adjusted.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1069702/files/20141203185222-line.gif?1417661542"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
</div>
<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Ok. Any questions?</span><br/>
</h3>
<br/>
<p><b>How big are smrtGRiPs?</b></p>
<p>We designed the smrtGRiPs to be so small that it can be attached discretely to virtually any handlebar. It’s only 16 mm in diameter and 150mm in length – about the size of a standard felt pen – and weighs less than 95 grams. That’s about 3.5 ounces.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>How long do the batteries last<b><b>?</b></b></b></p>
<p>Under normal use (2 hours of commuting per day/beacons on 24/7), the smrtGRiPs batteries will last over 3 months.</p>
<p><b>How do I recharge the batteries?</b></p>
<p>Recharge the smrtGRIPs using the smrtGRIPs charger or connect it to a USB power source using micro USB cable. </p>
<p><b>What is smrtGRIPS' range?</b></p>
<p>smrtGRIPs' range is approximately 100 meters (330 feet).</p>
<p><b>How do <b>smrtGRiPs </b>attach to your bike?</b></p>
<p>You simply insert it into your handlebar and screw it to the provided grip or the lock ring.</p>
<p><b>How are smrtGRiPs unique?</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>First ever all-in-one eyes-free navigation, haptic feedback notifications with bike tracker grips.</li>
<li>First bike app designed for optimal eyes-free user experience. Be safe and enjoy your journey by keeping your eyes on the road, not on your display.</li>
<li>Super stealthy. They're really, really, really, ridiculously integrated. No one will notice it.</li>
<li>
Bike Tracker: Technology that allows users to locate their items after they have been lost. The smrtGRiPs Connect App is designed to work on the world's largest crowdGPS network, currently locating lost items 8 times every minute.<br/>
</li>
<li>Redundant Beacons: Unlike single item trackers, your bike gets two devices acting as beacons for increased reliability and availability. If one fails, you'll still have another smrtGRIPs signaling away.</li>
<li>Separation Alert: Notifies you when a member of your family or bike tour group loses his way.</li>
<li>Bike Finder: The Bike Finder remembers where you left your bike last on a GPS map. At close range, but still can't find it? Make it ring!</li>
<li>High Capacity Lithium Ion Battery: The smrtGRiPs battery capacity  is 4 times greater than most item trackers on the market, and it's <u>rechargeable</u>. A single charge will last over 3 months.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Can I use your product with other BLE Tracking devices?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! The smrtGRiPs Connect App can work with other BLE tracking devices, Bluetooth cars, headsets and more. You'll be able to use the Bike Finder and Separation Alert Features with such devices. However, to enjoy these features as they were originally intended you will need the smrtGRiPS devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I use smrtGRiPs with Google Maps?</b></p>
<p>Yes! smrtGRiPs left/right haptic feedback notifications respond to Google Maps turn-by-turn notifications. We intend to support  more navigation apps in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I use smrtGRiPs with a drop down handlebar?</b></p>
<p>The current smrtGRiPs available are not designed for drop down handlebars. However, a drop down smrtGRiPs version is planned for Q2 2015.</p>
<p><b>What's your plan for Android support?</b></p>
<p>We're developping on Android using the Bluetooth Low Energy API's. We're dedicated on providing a world class Android app.  Android is supported at launch.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>How many <b>smrtGRiPs </b>devices can a smartphone find?</b></p>
<p>Using the smrtGRiPs app, a smartphone can manage up to 10 smrtGRIPs  at once on iOS. On Android, this number varies from 1 to 10.</p>
<p><b>Is the device water resistant?</b></p>
<p>The device is actually waterproof, so you can ride through heavy rain or drop your bike in a canal as long as it is not deeper than 10m. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where are smrtGRiPS made?</b></p>
<p>The smrtGRiPs are designed and engineered in Germany. Parts are sourced in the US and China.</p>
<p><b>How much is shipping?</b></p>
<p>Shipping and handling, which includes packing and fulfilling orders, will cost $10 in the Domestic United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), $20 to Canada, and $30 for international orders.</p>
<p><b>Where do I pay for shipping?</b><br/></p>
<p>You need to add your shipping cost in the additional donation field when you back the campaign.<br/></p>
<p><b>Oops! I forgot to add amount for shipping! What should I do?</b></p>
<p>Please contribute the right shipping amount and select no perk. We will match your contributions.</p>
<p><b>I want to upgrade my perk</b></p>
<p>Please contribute the difference and select no perk. We will match up your contribution to the correct perk and will confirm after the campaign.</p>
<p><b>Is this iOS 8 Compatible?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it is compatible from iOS 7 &amp; on.</p>
<p><b>Will smrtGRiPs work with the COBI Bike System?</b></p>
<p>Since the product is not readily available, we can't guarantee it yet, but we don't see why not.  We believe that the smrtGRiPs could be an ideal companion product for the COBI, so it can provide an Eyes-Free Connected Biking Experience too. We are committed to supporting it as soon as it is possible. Full disclosure, we are COBI backers and think it's cool, and we're looking forward on receiving our COBI Dev Kit.</p>

A Solidworks Native, he has already helped several members of the maker community  transform their inventions into market ready products.  He knows what it takes to turn a good idea into a great product.









Risk and Challenges

We have lined up valuable and expert partners that will be involved in important areas of product development and manufacturing. The prototypes we have produced have helped us confirm that we can manage risks associated to their development and production. 
Supply Chain
We reduced the number of parts required to manufacture the smrtGRiPS by choosing high quality and  highly integrated components.  By doing so,  we believe that we have reduced our exposure to delays that could potentially occur by longer than expected lead times.
Crowdsourced Design: Making it Perfect
As soon as the campaign gets going, we will be looking into what our backers have to say regarding the final design.  We have included this step in our production process so you can help us create you the best smrtGRiPS ever. We believe that your contribution will  maximize your ROI (Return On Investment). There is nothing more valuable than having a product that you really want. 
The Great Outdoors
smrtGRiPs are designed to  work in the most extreme weather conditions, and even under water (10m). Once we are certain that the smrtGRiPS can perform as expected in severe weather conditions, we will initiate pre-production. We accounted for testing in our schedule. Our first pre-production samples will be submitted to a battery of tests. It's difficult to predict the exact outcome. It is a possibility that testing may take longer than expected, in order to make the modifications needed to reach the standards we are aiming for. 
The Litmus Test: Certification 
Following the pre-production run, the smrtGRiPs will undergo all the necessary steps for certification. These are the the governing bodies’ mandatory requirements  that we must comply with in order to ship to the different countries. These tests will need to happen before delivering smrtGRiPs to our backers. Even though several of our team members are well versed in these requirements, there is a risk that we may face delays in the eventuality that some of the components parts have to be reworked or adjusted.



Ok. Any questions?


How big are smrtGRiPs?
We designed the smrtGRiPs to be so small that it can be attached discretely to virtually any handlebar. It’s only 16 mm in diameter and 150mm in length – about the size of a standard felt pen – and weighs less than 95 grams. That’s about 3.5 ounces.


How long do the batteries last?
Under normal use (2 hours of commuting per day/beacons on 24/7), the smrtGRiPs batteries will last over 3 months.
How do I recharge the batteries?
Recharge the smrtGRIPs using the smrtGRIPs charger or connect it to a USB power source using micro USB cable. 
What is smrtGRIPS' range?
smrtGRIPs' range is approximately 100 meters (330 feet).
How do smrtGRiPs attach to your bike?
You simply insert it into your handlebar and screw it to the provided grip or the lock ring.
How are smrtGRiPs unique?


First ever all-in-one eyes-free navigation, haptic feedback notifications with bike tracker grips.
First bike app designed for optimal eyes-free user experience. Be safe and enjoy your journey by keeping your eyes on the road, not on your display.
Super stealthy. They're really, really, really, ridiculously integrated. No one will notice it.

Bike Tracker: Technology that allows users to locate their items after they have been lost. The smrtGRiPs Connect App is designed to work on the world's largest crowdGPS network, currently locating lost items 8 times every minute.

Redundant Beacons: Unlike single item trackers, your bike gets two devices acting as beacons for increased reliability and availability. If one fails, you'll still have another smrtGRIPs signaling away.
Separation Alert: Notifies you when a member of your family or bike tour group loses his way.
Bike Finder: The Bike Finder remembers where you left your bike last on a GPS map. At close range, but still can't find it? Make it ring!
High Capacity Lithium Ion Battery: The smrtGRiPs battery capacity  is 4 times greater than most item trackers on the market, and it's rechargeable. A single charge will last over 3 months.

Can I use your product with other BLE Tracking devices?
Absolutely! The smrtGRiPs Connect App can work with other BLE tracking devices, Bluetooth cars, headsets and more. You'll be able to use the Bike Finder and Separation Alert Features with such devices. However, to enjoy these features as they were originally intended you will need the smrtGRiPS devices.

Can I use smrtGRiPs with Google Maps?
Yes! smrtGRiPs left/right haptic feedback notifications respond to Google Maps turn-by-turn notifications. We intend to support  more navigation apps in the future.

Can I use smrtGRiPs with a drop down handlebar?
The current smrtGRiPs available are not designed for drop down handlebars. However, a drop down smrtGRiPs version is planned for Q2 2015.
What's your plan for Android support?
We're developping on Android using the Bluetooth Low Energy API's. We're dedicated on providing a world class Android app.  Android is supported at launch.

How many smrtGRiPs devices can a smartphone find?
Using the smrtGRiPs app, a smartphone can manage up to 10 smrtGRIPs  at once on iOS. On Android, this number varies from 1 to 10.
Is the device water resistant?
The device is actually waterproof, so you can ride through heavy rain or drop your bike in a canal as long as it is not deeper than 10m. 

Where are smrtGRiPS made?
The smrtGRiPs are designed and engineered in Germany. Parts are sourced in the US and China.
How much is shipping?
Shipping and handling, which includes packing and fulfilling orders, will cost $10 in the Domestic United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), $20 to Canada, and $30 for international orders.
Where do I pay for shipping?
You need to add your shipping cost in the additional donation field when you back the campaign.
Oops! I forgot to add amount for shipping! What should I do?
Please contribute the right shipping amount and select no perk. We will match your contributions.
I want to upgrade my perk
Please contribute the difference and select no perk. We will match up your contribution to the correct perk and will confirm after the campaign.
Is this iOS 8 Compatible?
Yes, it is compatible from iOS 7 & on.
Will smrtGRiPs work with the COBI Bike System?
Since the product is not readily available, we can't guarantee it yet, but we don't see why not.  We believe that the smrtGRiPs could be an ideal companion product for the COBI, so it can provide an Eyes-Free Connected Biking Experience too. We are committed to supporting it as soon as it is possible. Full disclosure, we are COBI backers and think it's cool, and we're looking forward on receiving our COBI Dev Kit.

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>I am attempting to raise enough funds to launch the first season of an Interactive Adventure show.  This video web series will allow viewers to guide the host across Canada and the United States, visiting various unique geographical regions.</p>
<p><strong>The first Adventure will be to New York City, from August 6 to 9, 2012. </strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Taking Risks</h3>
<p>Just over 3 years ago I summoned the courage to chase a dream that seemed absolutely crazy to all my friends and family. I decided that my future would become completely reliant on entertaining people by producing YouTube videos.</p>
<p>What started out with creating simple Video Game tutorials, quickly became an obsession to reinvent myself and explore the seemingly limitless opportunities of film and video web series.</p>
<p>Last Year, I experimented with a spontaneous travel show called ""Gamers Abroad"".  In the very first episode, I flew across the Atlantic Ocean, ran around Rome, Italy for 24 hrs attempting to complete various tasks that viewers asked me to do, and returned back home the following day.  The entire experience was captured on film and shared with my followers.</p>
<p>You can watch the video here, <a href=""http://youtu.be/v8OlE34HVPI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/v8OlE34HVPI</a></p>
<p>However, I felt like there was something missing from the show, so I put the idea on the backburner, providing me time to explore other options and learn more about what my ""job"" actually is.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Light Bulb!</h3>
<p>One year later, Interactive Idiot was born; it evolved from the realization that everything I do is meant to entertain my viewers, and what better way than to make them feel like they had actually taken an adventure with me, rather than simply watching videos of someone else’s trip.</p>
<p>The ""Interactive"" aspect is critical to the overall experience I am attempting to bring to life.  Throughout the adventure, followers will be given pictures or short videos (30-60 seconds long) with options on where to go and what to see in REAL time. </p>
<p>Followers of Interactive Idiot will be required to follow me on my Twitter account, <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/GUNNS4HIRE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/#!/GUNNS4HIRE</a> , where they will be provided with regular updates throughout each and every adventure.</p>
<p>The resulting video series essentially becomes a shared adventure, something that you personally had a hand in creating.</p>
<p>Interactive Idiot is the evolution of a conventional travel show.  This kind of experience is only now possible thanks to online social connectivity, via Smart phones, tablets, and Social media websites like Twitter.</p>
<p>Help me start the most amazing interactive worldwide adventure series that you will ever be a part of.</p>
