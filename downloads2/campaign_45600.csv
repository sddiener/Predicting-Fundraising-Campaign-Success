<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Last year when we conceived the idea of making a Desk Lamp, the first thought was to create something unique that has the traditional value &amp; Contemporary design but we never wanted to make a complex thing. After lots of research and experiments we decided to make a desk lamp as similar to Pyramids. We all know Pyramids has significance of Power, Knowledge, Design, Art &amp; Perseverance. To make it more contemporary we changed the four sides to tetrahedron, the Triangle with all three sides and base of triangular shape.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The next was the looks, making it look as the real pyramid was quite a challenge. We don't wanted to make the steps at the exterior as it requires a larger area so we planed it to give the similar textures. Sand was the quickest remedy but it failed as it was difficult to match the granulates for each lamp &amp; cleaning the sand for application was messy and not resulted as desirable so we concluded to make our own Sand with perfect granulates, Color shade &amp; texture. Not every beach &amp; sand stone is perfect to make sand texture similar to Great Pyramids, we thoroughly studied the colors, shades &amp; granulates that matched the desired results. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our journey begins and after 5 months of tiring and rigorous travel to almost all the states in INDIA and collecting beach and sand stones from more than 38 rivers. With hundreds of experiments lastly we found our desired mix of stone granulates that gave us the textures closest to the Pyramids. The final granulates was a mix of seven river stones. The most amazing fact is the seven rivers stones we used was from the seven most sacred rivers of INDIA, The Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Godavari, Kaveri, Narmada &amp; Shipra, we felt blessed and focused in completing the product. To add a shimmer effect to the texture we added a Natural Mica Stone  granulates found in state of Rajasthan to our sand mix.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To make it durable and sturdy we use the Polypropylene Thermo - Fibre Sheets as the basic body with MDF base and best class luminosity adjustable electronic devises with LED Bulbs. Its luminosity ranges from LUX1 to LUX5. The complete Lamp is coated with clear Non toxic latex coating. The ""AURA"" is born....</p>

<p>Our new “Bungee and Pull-Charm” system is AWESOME! Tightening the dress is easier than ever, and the bungee has stretch so you can dial in your fit and tension to fit any shape or size, or even large bust size.  Once you set the size, you can and slip in and out of the dress easily without having to adjust it over and over again. The two adjustment points make it easy to find your perfect size and fit - making it easy to share with others, or give as a gift.</p>

<p>  Hi, we’re April and Dennis and we’ve worked for 3 years to develop what we believe is the most amazing dress system in the world that every active woman would love! We have come back to Indiegogo because of this community, a community that cares and challenges us to grow and improve our products and ourselves. When you pledge for The Undress today, you help our little company accomplish new things like develop a wholesale program for the first time so we can sell The Undress in running, yoga, and other specialty stores; pursue worldwide distribution, and redevelop the brand as our next evolution of our transformation. We have a unique opportunity, and we can’t do this ourselves - we need your help. We invite you to join thousands of our backers worldwide who are courageous, daring, bold, and passionate women from all over the world that represent the Courage to Change. Please pledge, and please share, and we look forward to having you become the first in the world to own The Undress Version 4, and join our founders family.</p>

</div></div>","ORDER NEW PRINTS NOW 
         We wanted to create a product that would empower women to be active, and support their active lifestyles. Woman regularly change clothes in the wildest of places - fighting sports bras, sticky leggings, and wet shirts - forcing millions of us to change in cars, nasty restrooms, and towel changing in public, just so we can enjoy the activities we love. This is a real problem MILLIONS of women share!With its patented features, you can change into, or out of, The Undress anywhere, in as little as 30 seconds. No privacy needed! It works so well, it even works to remove sports bras, and is great for big busted women.



How it works is simple - You can quickly change INTO OR OUT OF ANY OUTFIT, USING THE UNDRESS. 



Remove Your Top: First, bring The Undress to your waist. Then use the soft handle to guide the front of the dress underneath anything you want to remove. Bring the straps over your head, and cinch both the neck and back cord locks to secure. Finally, simply remove your top and bra.

Remove Your Bottoms: Insert your hands into the side access openings to easily remove your bottoms. Done!


Change into another outfit, such as your running clothes, by reversing the process. 

Put your bra and top over The Undress, and use the special side openings to put on your bottoms.
Next, simply loosen the cord locks and use the soft handle to guide the straps under all your top layers. 
Then just slip out of The Undress, and you’ll be in your new outfit!


 
      The Undress is VERY ADJUSTABLE and is designed to fit varied body sizes and shapes. The Super Soft fabric is comfy and stretchy, and conforms to the figure.  The Bungee and Pull Cord System is like magic!
SIZE TIPS & INFO: 80% of our customers purchase the size ""B"" dress. Size Guarantee - If it doesn't fit, we'll take it back! It's easy to give as a gift, it grows and shrinks with you (even pregnant women love it!)

 Yes you can wear The Undress in multiple ways!  So you can be ready for a Workout or a Night Out!


 The Undress Version 4 is packed with 12 new features, making The Undress Version 4 the most packable, travel-friendly, light, and affordable Undress ever.
 


It packs with a ""snap!"" and even fits in pockets! It's lighter weight, without losing any fabric thickness, or quality.


We added brand new built-in bra petals that can replace the need for a bra for some and works like magic, and add chest coverage without the bulk of a bra. 
The bra petals are sandwiched between the front panel and the dress lining, so they are not visible AND they do not touch the skin!


You can wear The Undress as a strapless Dress!


The bungee allows you to wear it as a skirt, which allows you to change just your bottoms when needed.


Our new “Bungee and Pull-Charm” system is AWESOME! Tightening the dress is easier than ever, and the bungee has stretch so you can dial in your fit and tension to fit any shape or size, or even large bust size.  Once you set the size, you can and slip in and out of the dress easily without having to adjust it over and over again. The two adjustment points make it easy to find your perfect size and fit - making it easy to share with others, or give as a gift.


With the new Bungee and Pull Charm, The Undress V4 is so adjustable, it only takes 3 sizes to fit youth to XXXL!Pictured: Stephanie in Size C, Morgan in Size A, and Sophie in Size B


The new side access openings make for the fastest changing ever! There is a new built-in view blocker and a sleeker pocket.


The label doubles as a cord holder to keep the strap centered and hidden. 


Fit is improved overall, especially in the bodice section as requested by our customers.


There are new Side Splits for style and function.
 


You can use The Undress as a car seat cover to keep your ride clean.


 For an extra custom fit, a brand new optional belt in different colors will be available so you can customize your look! As you can see, we really wanted to make a dress every woman would love even better.

 


 
                             

The Undress is so useful, you can use it before or after any workout or activity.


TRAVEL - Travel dress, especially in hostels - you can even change in trains and planes. Wear it multiple ways for any destination!

STUDIO - In a studio, when there are no changing rooms or bathroom lines are too long.

WATER - The Undress is perfect for beach and swim sports.
Do deck changes securely or change right on the beach without ever leaving your spot.

MUD RUNS & OBSTACLE RACES - After Mud runs, when you don’t want to change in your car.

OUTDOORS - Light enough to take hiking and camping. Especially helpful if you’re sharing a tent!

FOR SPORTS TEAMS - both on and off the field, especially if you're surrounded by spectators. Show up in The Undress and change on the spot if needed!

LOCKER ROOMS + YOUTH - It’s perfect for students who must change in school locker rooms.

PHOTOGRAPHERS AND VIDEOGRAPHERS - Models & Actresses can change anywhere during shoots, saving valuable time!

EVERYDAY WEAR - It’s beautiful and comfortable so you will want to wear it like your other favorite dress! 


 
       
The more pledges we receive, the more fabric options we will add!
Final Approved Fabric Options will be given after the campaign.
As always, final selection is dependent on availability from fabric suppliers and may change at any time (that is the nature of the industry). We will do everything we can to get a very similar fabric to what is shown, in case we can't get the exact fabric. 
We will do our best to get the biggest selection possible for everyone!


                       
 
This is our LAST campaign for The Undress so we want to make it extra special and share with you new products we’ve always wanted to create! We hope you will join us for this last campaign.

*The Super Shawl is back - it is now self-packing like The Undress and available in multiple colors!

 
 
 

You've requested it for years, and now we have an optional Light weight CONVERTIBLE Bra that is made specifically to fit The Undress. Perfect after workouts or to put on while wearing The Undress.

 

 

Available Color: Black
Available Sizes XS - 3XL
We will need at least 500 backers to meet our minimum order


We’re SO excited for this - you can receive an Agents of Change, custom designed Vegan Leather handbag in a style and color ONLY available in this campaign. Designed with The Undress as inspiration - it even has side access openings! This handbag is awesome!

 

Colors Available: Black, Royal Blue
We will need at least 200 backers per color to meet our minimum order

Stretch Goal Colors: White, Red, Custom Print, and Additional color!
 


As a token of appreciation for giving so much to us throughout the years, we have made The Undress more affordable than ever! Our Undress V3 retails for $99, and The Undress V4 is only available here on Indiegogo for an AMAZING price!
 
 
 

All we need is YOU! The Undress Version 4 is not yet in production, and YOU can help make it a reality.
Our team and factories are ready, and now all we need is you to make this real. Please choose a pledge level that works best for you, and join our community that believes EVERY woman deserves the comfort and security that The Undress brings.
Please pledge, please share. Just say YES to The Undress, and become an Agent of Change. Thank you!


 

  Hi, we’re April and Dennis and we’ve worked for 3 years to develop what we believe is the most amazing dress system in the world that every active woman would love! We have come back to Indiegogo because of this community, a community that cares and challenges us to grow and improve our products and ourselves. When you pledge for The Undress today, you help our little company accomplish new things like develop a wholesale program for the first time so we can sell The Undress in running, yoga, and other specialty stores; pursue worldwide distribution, and redevelop the brand as our next evolution of our transformation. We have a unique opportunity, and we can’t do this ourselves - we need your help. We invite you to join thousands of our backers worldwide who are courageous, daring, bold, and passionate women from all over the world that represent the Courage to Change. Please pledge, and please share, and we look forward to having you become the first in the world to own The Undress Version 4, and join our founders family.




























We started in 2014, and have multiple successful Crowdfunding Campaigns and delivered EVERY SINGLE ORDER. We have taken care of customers to satisfaction, and have a guarantee. We have delivered over 25,000 dresses, and that number continues to grow everyday!

She was a creative individual who was passionate about being a tailor. I moved to the United States with my two brothers in other to join our father. I began taking modeling classes and realized there weren't many opportunities for everyone.  This led me to think outside the box and take matters into my own hands. I wanted my voice to be heard and I wanted to create a platform that gives young people an opportunity to grow, to embrace themselves, and to be confident that they can achieve all that they wanted to in the industry.

She was a creative individual who was passionate about being a tailor. I moved to the United States with my two brothers in other to join our father. I began taking modeling classes and realized there weren't many opportunities for everyone.  This led me to think outside the box and take matters into my own hands. I wanted my voice to be heard and I wanted to create a platform that gives young people an opportunity to grow, to embrace themselves, and to be confident that they can achieve all that they wanted to in the industry. Two years, right after graduating from high school, I started my brand Unique by Reelia in 2013. A wearable accessories brand, that I started making myself with $1. I have been involved in various fashion shows, including international shows.The Mission:The Afro Expo Fashion Week will combine two diverse cultures to create a bigger and superior culture of fashion to expand the norm of what we perceive to be already done and make a fresher and unique statement in the fashion industry. This is an opportunity for young designers to get involved in the fashion week aspect of the fashion industry at an affordable price.This project will be beneficial to low income designers who are looking for a way to expose their artistic works  but have been holding back because of the lack of money. This project will support them at launching their career at an affordable price. The more African designers we have in the industry, the better it will be to promote Africa and its culture in other to give back to Africa.How Are We Giving It All Back?Wondering why you should support this project ?The Afro Expo Fashion Week is also a fundraising project to raise funds to support our dream girls handcrafted project in Togo. As a Togolese woman living in America, I believe in giving back to my county.

Being a photographer for many years, I try and make sense of what I like about an image, what makes it pop, what makes it beautiful, so that I may improve as a photographer. But the only things that stand out to me in these images are the ultra skinny, over airbrushed, all too perfect model or celebrity that has posed for them. So I had an epiphany. What if I were to photograph the ""every day beautiful woman"" and publish my own book or magazine? Then the world can see the beauty of women, beyond Hollywood. <br/><br/>I grabbed my gear and a few makeup artists and hair dressers, bartered out studio space, scouted outdoor locations, and told everyone I knew. In nearly six months I photographed 35 women, capping my goal at 50. The biographies that I am writing on these women are incredible. Each woman is uniquely different; each one beautiful. They range from the house wife, the mother of four, the breast cancer survivor, the police officer, the 9 to 5 professional, the artist, the mortician, the student, the unemployed... and the list goes on!<br/><br/>But as with all projects, there are problems. Now I am faced with a dilemma. Do I publish it as a book, or an ongoing magazine? Do I self publish with sites like Blurb.com and pay nearly $35 per book, or do I hold out for offers. One way or another, it all comes down to that magic word: MONEY. Simply, there is none. I've photographed every single woman for free, so there's no secret bank account with funds socked away. Clearly, I need to raise money to market, promote and print this book. <br/><br/>If this book falls short of completion, it would be devastating. Not only to me as the artist behind it, essentially crushing a dream, but to all of the women who worked tirelessly to get this amazing project done. I couldn't possibly tell 50 women that they were no longer going to be in the book because there is no book. I just can't do it. <br/><br/>I think setting a budget of $5,000 for this project is about what is needed to get it all done: the website, the marketing and promotion, the ISBN, the design fees and the printing. Every single person that helps fund this project will get a special thank you in the book or magazine. Larger pledge amounts will get free prints, wallpapers for computers and phones, even a copy of the finished product when it is all finished. <br/><br/>I would like to thank you all in advance for taking the time to read about me and my vision, and also for making the pledge. Please take an extra moment to share this with people you know so that they can also help us reach our goal.

<p><strong>Hello! I’m Wolfgang, co-creator of Skarabeos. I’m excited to introduce our products to you.</strong></p>
<p>My two colleagues and I travel frequently. We always carry our mobile devices and other important personal items in our bags. And we frequently worry about their being stolen or lost.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, our team has created a solution that offers you a new kind of personal protection. Inspired by the ancient Egyptian scarab beetle, a symbol of shelter and protection, we’d like to introduce you to Skarabeos.</p>

<p>Skarabeos products feature a proprietary electronic protection system that is totally unique.</p>
<p>This system alerts you immediately when someone tries to open your bag. Our enhanced distance alerts ensure that you will never again forget your bag, and that it won’t be stolen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522238636/nazbllcbaetkp9903eeb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These instant and preventive alarm functions enable you to react in real time. It’s the most effective way to discourage thieves and to protect your belongings against theft and loss.</p>
<p>The electronic protection system consists of the Skarabeos Box with smart sensors and energy-efficient Bluetooth interface, synched to the free Skarabeos app. This system works with any of our bags.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521558296/dph7yezj5b3ipogymmxo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each of our bags is also equipped with magnetic protection. A flap containing 10 magnets folds over the bag opening. Its strong bond prevents pickpockets from opening the bag unnoticed. Bags equipped with magnetic protection have no travel restrictions, so you can carry them right onto the plane.</p>
<p>This system guarantees that you and your valuables will be safer than ever before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522261999/fiyfeij3tick1u3wf7il.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>All this comes with an app for your phone and smartwatch.</p>

<p>The app links your bag to your phone and watch. You‘ll be able to receive alarms and notifications on both devices. You can also simply monitor your belongings via the app.</p>
<p>Our system is highly customizable. You can turn it on and off, or activate individual alarm functions. You can also pause the system if you need to remove something quickly from your bag. And you can protect multiple bags at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Our app is totally free, and we never collect any personal data.</strong></p>
<p>Our app is also available for your smartwatch.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522408385/hhouhdfh7drdq0kjd0qz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The watch app is super practical, allowing you to use the protection system without reaching for your phone. All it takes to check in is a glance at your wrist.</p>
<p>Skarabeos is also one of the first watch apps that enable a dialogue between a wearable and a smartwatch. We think this makes your smartwatch even more interesting to use!</p>
<p><strong>Currently, our app is only available for iOS and WatchOS. We want to create an Android app, but to do so we need your support for this campaign.       </strong>       </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Our hardware is optimized for low energy consumption. Two readily available AA batteries provide a year’s worth of energy, so there’s no need for daily charging. A battery indicator in the app shows you the current capacity and promptly reminds you when you need to change batteries.    </p>

<p>We’re starting this campaign with our launch products, a backpack and a briefcase. We also offer a range of modular accessories that you can fit into all of our bags. <strong>In the future, we hope to produce collections of bags for men and women.</strong> </p>
<p>We combine design and innovative technology with sustainability. The electronic protection system is energy-efficient and fits in each one of our bags. We also only work with partners, suppliers and manufacturers who value fair employment, human rights and social equity. <strong>One goal of our campaign is to be able to offer our bags in a sustainable material.</strong> We would appreciate your support in helping us make that happen.</p>
<p>And last but not least: high quality is a must. We’ve carefully selected the finest premium materials for our bags. A high quality and durable nylon from Italy. A traditional wool loden from Austria. Waterproof YKK zippers. Our collaboration with the world’s best textile producers guarantees a long life for your Skarabeos bag.</p>

<p>Skarabeos was founded in 2016 by a team based in Linz and Berlin: Wolfgang Langeder, Christian Dils and Manuel Seckel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521554619/ho1d5o3kpalynqivilnu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Wolfgang has a background in fashion and founded his first wearable tech company Utope in 2012. Christian and Manuel are tech experts working for Fraunhofer Institute, Germany. They founded their own company Stretchable Circuits in 2009.</p>
<p>The first time we met was in Austria in 2009 at Ars Electronica, a festival connecting the design and technology community. From then on, we have combined our passion and expertise to create well-designed and innovative products.</p>
<p><strong>In 2013 we achieved international success and were awarded a Red Dot/Best of the Best for the realization of Sporty Supaheroe</strong>, one of the very first products to use stretchable electronics. Since then, the team has continued to work on breakthrough concepts to improve people’s lives with wearable technology.</p>
<p>We have been working on ideas and concepts for an electronic protection system since 2016. Now we are happy and proud to make our first products available here for you.</p>

<p>We have already finished the development and testing of our products and started working with experienced manufacturing partners. Thus, we are close to getting Skarabeos to market.</p>
<ul>
<li>We collaborated with Berlin-based bag expert Bagjack to produce our bags.</li>
<li>The first batch of electronics has already been assembled in Germany and the supplier is ready for upscaling the production.</li>
<li>Award-winning app specialist Evenly programmed our iOS and WatchOS apps.</li>
<li>Graphic designer Manuel Radde created the packaging design for all of our products.</li>
<li>Since late 2017, friends and supporters have been travelling the world with our bags to test its features.</li>

<p>There are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life. We have been working for more than two years developing Skarabeos and getting it ready for production. We know what the next steps are for manufacturing and fulfillment and have great partners ready to start.</p>
<p>We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we’ve done so far. We sucessfully develop cutting-edge and award-winning hardware products like Skarabeos together since 8 years now and we have a deep expertise, years of combined experience and established business partners. So we can confidently say that we are well prepared and we have developed systems and processes to mitigate the risks that arise in this process.</p>
<p>We know that the most important part of our process is the commitment we made to you and to deliver Skarabeos to you on time! We will work hard to ensure that we deliver what we promise.</p>

</div></div>","Hello! I’m Wolfgang, co-creator of Skarabeos. I’m excited to introduce our products to you.
My two colleagues and I travel frequently. We always carry our mobile devices and other important personal items in our bags. And we frequently worry about their being stolen or lost.
Over the past two years, our team has created a solution that offers you a new kind of personal protection. Inspired by the ancient Egyptian scarab beetle, a symbol of shelter and protection, we’d like to introduce you to Skarabeos.
 

Skarabeos designs innovative anti-theft bags and accessories. Our bags offer you the highest level of protection to keep your personal belongings and tech safe. Unique security functions mean peace of mind for you. And iconic design integrates our products seamlessly into your daily life.
Feel safe, enjoy peace of mind with Skarabeos.

 

 
 

Skarabeos products feature an innovative electronic protection system. It consists of the Skarabeos Box, synched to the free Skarabeos app. You can simply activate this system via your phone or your smartwatch and you will be notified by an alarm on both devices.
 


An alarm sounds instantly if a thief attempts to open your bag.
 


And if a thief tries to grab the whole bag? You’ll be notified instantly as well. The alarm will be activated as soon as the bag is taken away from you.
 


If you forget your bag somewhere, you will be notified immediately so you can get it right back.
     
 

Skarabeos products feature a proprietary electronic protection system that is totally unique.
This system alerts you immediately when someone tries to open your bag. Our enhanced distance alerts ensure that you will never again forget your bag, and that it won’t be stolen.

These instant and preventive alarm functions enable you to react in real time. It’s the most effective way to discourage thieves and to protect your belongings against theft and loss.
The electronic protection system consists of the Skarabeos Box with smart sensors and energy-efficient Bluetooth interface, synched to the free Skarabeos app. This system works with any of our bags.

Each of our bags is also equipped with magnetic protection. A flap containing 10 magnets folds over the bag opening. Its strong bond prevents pickpockets from opening the bag unnoticed. Bags equipped with magnetic protection have no travel restrictions, so you can carry them right onto the plane.
This system guarantees that you and your valuables will be safer than ever before.
 

All this comes with an app for your phone and smartwatch.

The app links your bag to your phone and watch. You‘ll be able to receive alarms and notifications on both devices. You can also simply monitor your belongings via the app.
Our system is highly customizable. You can turn it on and off, or activate individual alarm functions. You can also pause the system if you need to remove something quickly from your bag. And you can protect multiple bags at the same time.
Our app is totally free, and we never collect any personal data.
Our app is also available for your smartwatch.

The watch app is super practical, allowing you to use the protection system without reaching for your phone. All it takes to check in is a glance at your wrist.
Skarabeos is also one of the first watch apps that enable a dialogue between a wearable and a smartwatch. We think this makes your smartwatch even more interesting to use!
Currently, our app is only available for iOS and WatchOS. We want to create an Android app, but to do so we need your support for this campaign.              
 

Our hardware is optimized for low energy consumption. Two readily available AA batteries provide a year’s worth of energy, so there’s no need for daily charging. A battery indicator in the app shows you the current capacity and promptly reminds you when you need to change batteries.    

Our compact alarm system is also very lightweight. No need to lug around heavy spare batteries!

 

At Skarabeos, design is in our DNA. It’s foundation for everything that we do. As a team we’ve been working together for 10 years on combining perfect design with the most innovative technology of our time.
Skarabeos is about straightforward design. It’s about products that are beautiful and work perfectly. They fit seamlessly into your everyday life and offer you discreet protection. With Skarabeos you are not just better protected, you also look better when you’re out and about.

We’re starting this campaign with our launch products, a backpack and a briefcase. We also offer a range of modular accessories that you can fit into all of our bags. In the future, we hope to produce collections of bags for men and women. 
We combine design and innovative technology with sustainability. The electronic protection system is energy-efficient and fits in each one of our bags. We also only work with partners, suppliers and manufacturers who value fair employment, human rights and social equity. One goal of our campaign is to be able to offer our bags in a sustainable material. We would appreciate your support in helping us make that happen.
And last but not least: high quality is a must. We’ve carefully selected the finest premium materials for our bags. A high quality and durable nylon from Italy. A traditional wool loden from Austria. Waterproof YKK zippers. Our collaboration with the world’s best textile producers guarantees a long life for your Skarabeos bag.

Skarabeos was founded in 2016 by a team based in Linz and Berlin: Wolfgang Langeder, Christian Dils and Manuel Seckel.

Wolfgang has a background in fashion and founded his first wearable tech company Utope in 2012. Christian and Manuel are tech experts working for Fraunhofer Institute, Germany. They founded their own company Stretchable Circuits in 2009.
The first time we met was in Austria in 2009 at Ars Electronica, a festival connecting the design and technology community. From then on, we have combined our passion and expertise to create well-designed and innovative products.
In 2013 we achieved international success and were awarded a Red Dot/Best of the Best for the realization of Sporty Supaheroe, one of the very first products to use stretchable electronics. Since then, the team has continued to work on breakthrough concepts to improve people’s lives with wearable technology.
We have been working on ideas and concepts for an electronic protection system since 2016. Now we are happy and proud to make our first products available here for you.
 

We have already finished the development and testing of our products and started working with experienced manufacturing partners. Thus, we are close to getting Skarabeos to market.

We collaborated with Berlin-based bag expert Bagjack to produce our bags.
The first batch of electronics has already been assembled in Germany and the supplier is ready for upscaling the production.
Award-winning app specialist Evenly programmed our iOS and WatchOS apps.
Graphic designer Manuel Radde created the packaging design for all of our products.
Since late 2017, friends and supporters have been travelling the world with our bags to test its features.


 


 

There are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life. We have been working for more than two years developing Skarabeos and getting it ready for production. We know what the next steps are for manufacturing and fulfillment and have great partners ready to start.
We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we’ve done so far. We sucessfully develop cutting-edge and award-winning hardware products like Skarabeos together since 8 years now and we have a deep expertise, years of combined experience and established business partners. So we can confidently say that we are well prepared and we have developed systems and processes to mitigate the risks that arise in this process.
We know that the most important part of our process is the commitment we made to you and to deliver Skarabeos to you on time! We will work hard to ensure that we deliver what we promise.

<p><i><b>Well now you can!</b></i></p>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Chrystal Rose. I'm a fitness lover, writer and entrepreneur who started my first business 3.5 years ago with a marketing company. Later, I became a co-owner of a women's empowerment website and print magazine. This year, I decided to try something new: <b>I combined my love of business with helping other women-- and created Rebellia.</b> </p>
<p>Last summer, after having been on my fitness journey for a little over a year, I left a department store dressing room in tears. I had finally found self-love, was both happy and confident in my skin, BUT my body had changed so much-- <i><b>nothing fit!</b></i> Shirts squeezed my biceps, pants strangled my butt and thighs but were big in the waist. I felt frustrated that I work so hard in the gym and was unable to find clothing that fit my body.<br/></p>
<p>After talking with some friends who felt the same way, I decided to dive in and see if I could create a solution to the problem so many of us have.</p>
<p>My vision is to launch our website this fall and eventually have various style options for women, <b>who can shop with the confidence</b> of knowing that whatever they buy, is made specifically to their measurements.</p>
<p>I want women with athletic bodies to have options when it comes to dressing up. We may not do it all the time, but when we do-- we shouldn't have to embark on a quest to find clothing that fits.</p> </div> <div> <h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<p>The money from this campaign will go towards the cost of labor and materials for the clothing-- regardless of whether we hit our goal or not. Anything beyond our goal or in excess of costs, will go towards creating new samples for our fall/winter line. Anything beyond <i>that</i> will go towards software and equipment that will make the custom element both more efficient and cost effective. <b>In fact, it will reduce the current labor costs by almost 40%!  </b>Which of course will be passed on to our customers.</p>
<p>Every dime collected from the <i>Rebel with a Cause</i> perk will go towards the creation and promotion of the piece and ultimately the cause itself. That level will not go towards company costs.<br/></p>
<h3>Perk Partners!</h3>
<div>We've teamed up with these awesome, female owned, fitness brands to give you some cute and functional perk options!</div>

</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I decided to launch this campaign for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>This is a test.</b> Is this something wanted and needed? Will the women who are telling me yes it is, stand up and contribute? Am I crazy? (Don't answer that!) Also, what pieces work and which don't? Which do better?</li>
<li>
<b>Wholesale fabric.</b> Since we're just getting started, buying a ton of fabric upfront doesn't make sense. Buying at retail, is simply insane. So if we can get one big order in after this campaign, it will save money and reduce the risk of buying too much or too little of what we need.</li>
<li>
<b>Custom clothing is expensive!</b> At the moment, my manufacturing options are pretty pricey. Having the money upfront will allow us to work with our current situation or possibly negotiate with someone new. </li>
<li>
<b>Gather our first group of loyal customers.</b> Every woman who gives to the campaign will be a part of our Think Tank. When we move forward and build our site, create new designs and add new pieces for fall, this initial group will be an integral part of that.</li>
</ul>
<div>I find that many of us in the fitness world get discouraged when shopping and feel uncomfortable in ""regular"" clothes. I want to change that. <br/>
</div>

Well now you can!
Hi everyone! My name is Chrystal Rose. I'm a fitness lover, writer and entrepreneur who started my first business 3.5 years ago with a marketing company. Later, I became a co-owner of a women's empowerment website and print magazine. This year, I decided to try something new: I combined my love of business with helping other women-- and created Rebellia. 
Last summer, after having been on my fitness journey for a little over a year, I left a department store dressing room in tears. I had finally found self-love, was both happy and confident in my skin, BUT my body had changed so much-- nothing fit! Shirts squeezed my biceps, pants strangled my butt and thighs but were big in the waist. I felt frustrated that I work so hard in the gym and was unable to find clothing that fit my body.
After talking with some friends who felt the same way, I decided to dive in and see if I could create a solution to the problem so many of us have.
My vision is to launch our website this fall and eventually have various style options for women, who can shop with the confidence of knowing that whatever they buy, is made specifically to their measurements.
I want women with athletic bodies to have options when it comes to dressing up. We may not do it all the time, but when we do-- we shouldn't have to embark on a quest to find clothing that fits.   What We Need & What You Get
 

The money from this campaign will go towards the cost of labor and materials for the clothing-- regardless of whether we hit our goal or not. Anything beyond our goal or in excess of costs, will go towards creating new samples for our fall/winter line. Anything beyond that will go towards software and equipment that will make the custom element both more efficient and cost effective. In fact, it will reduce the current labor costs by almost 40%!  Which of course will be passed on to our customers.
Every dime collected from the Rebel with a Cause perk will go towards the creation and promotion of the piece and ultimately the cause itself. That level will not go towards company costs.
Perk Partners!
We've teamed up with these awesome, female owned, fitness brands to give you some cute and functional perk options!




Viva La Rebellia Tank

This fun tank reminds you to kick ass in the gym and live your rebellious life-- because you and your body were not made in a cookie cutter.


Our Dresses
These dresses will ONLY be available during this campaign, so if you don't get one now-- you won't get the chance to again.


The Victorya Dress

A little sassy, a little sexy. The Victorya dress comes in multiple customizable options. Available in mini length (shown) or midi (not shown). Long sleeve (shown) or sleeveless (not shown). We can even make it in 2-piece to show off those abs! Color: Black


The Emmie Dress

The Emmie Dress comes with the option of an open bodice (See the Emmie Maxi below) or closed bodice. As well as varying color combos. Shown: Grey & Pink Seersucker. 
The Emmie Maxi




The Emmie Maxi comes with the option of an open bodice or closed bodice (See the Emmie Dress above) as well as varying color combos. Shown: Coral & Print.

   The Impact I decided to launch this campaign for several reasons:  
This is a test. Is this something wanted and needed? Will the women who are telling me yes it is, stand up and contribute? Am I crazy? (Don't answer that!) Also, what pieces work and which don't? Which do better?

Wholesale fabric. Since we're just getting started, buying a ton of fabric upfront doesn't make sense. Buying at retail, is simply insane. So if we can get one big order in after this campaign, it will save money and reduce the risk of buying too much or too little of what we need.

Custom clothing is expensive! At the moment, my manufacturing options are pretty pricey. Having the money upfront will allow us to work with our current situation or possibly negotiate with someone new. 

Gather our first group of loyal customers. Every woman who gives to the campaign will be a part of our Think Tank. When we move forward and build our site, create new designs and add new pieces for fall, this initial group will be an integral part of that.

I find that many of us in the fitness world get discouraged when shopping and feel uncomfortable in ""regular"" clothes. I want to change that. 

As one of the former owners of a magazine for women, and the current president of multiple FemCity chapters, empowering women and helping them to empower themselves is so important to me. Through this company I plan to continue to do that in as many ways as possible. Including finding ways to give back to causes, foundations, non-profits and charities.   Risks & Challenges Because these samples were created with retail fabric, the same colors/patterns may not be available when we fulfill orders-- but we are going to do the best we can to come close or substitute with something you love just as much.
We expect some user error when our contributors submit their measurements, but plan to provide visual instructions on how to be as accurate as possible.
There really isn't a template for what we're doing so we're sort of navigating the waters with the help and guidance of some really smart and experienced people. One of the biggest challenges will be to keep garment costs affordable for our customers. Finding a manufacturer that's willing to produce 'on demand' garments in varying sizes is sort of like embarking on a quest for a unicorn.

</p><h3><b>We're
on a mission to bring stylish self-expression to your personal wardrobe.</b></h3>
<p>Honestly,
the secret is simple: Your clothes should make you look good, feel good, endure
the whimsy of current trends and add to your mode of personal expression. </p>
<p>I’m Nicole
Allen, the lead designer for Historica Clothiers and for decades I’ve been
telling stories about myself through fashion. Getting dressed each morning is the
most obvious form of self-expression you will engage in all day. Clothes may
not make the man but they certainly tell a wordless story. Your personal style
can be an expression of your dreams, mood or fantasies (secret or otherwise). My
hobbies relate to long held fantasies of my own: to dance, swordfight, wear
armor, be a musician, paint, ride horses, and become a professional designer.
But long before any of that became a reality, I created outfits that expressed
the artist, fashion designer, dancer, rider and martial artist I didn't know I
would become. Everywhere I've gone in the world, I’ve been told, 'I love
what you are wearing, but I could never dress like that.’ </p>
<p><u>Nonsense</u>!
</p>
<p>Historica
Clothing exists to give you permission, options, inspiration and confidence to
express yourself sartorially. We are creating fashion that's not just something
to wear, but an experience that people want to share. For each piece in our
line we’ve given you a storyline, a way to invite you into to another world,
but the real point is for you to make it your own, and create your own story. </p>
<p>The concept
of crowd-funded fashion is a thing whose time has come. We believe the key to
designing clothing people feel they <i>must</i>
wear, is to ask what they have <i>dreamt</i>
of wearing. We’ve developed our first styles with a select group of folks just
like you – people who saw a need for more colorful, expressive clothing in
their lives. We call them our (cue the drumroll) Council of Consulting
Clothiers. </p>
<p>You don’t
need permission. Don’t dress like everyone else; step out of the mold and bring
a new level of creativity and style to your personal image!</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>Who We Are and What This Campaign Will Allow Us to Do:</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We’re
launching the line with this campaign in order to fund the creation of initial
line  - four styles each for men and
women. We’ve chosen to start with tailored garments because they provide the
most versatile, lasting, flattering styles – signature pieces that will become
staples in your wardrobe and can be used both dressed up and dressed down.
Making these patterns is a painstaking process, where we pick apart fit and
drape of each style (as analyzed on real people in real sizes, not fantasy fit
models). My team and I are credentialed, professional designers and personal
clothiers that have been working in the online fashion business for over ten
years. We know how to both create patterns that fit and flatter all body types,
and how to present them online with tons of photos and fit details – you can
trust these to be WYSIWIG designs, not the “bait and switch” we’ve all
experienced shopping online. </p>
<p>All of our
pieces are produced locally, here in Chicago, and everyone involved makes a
fair wage. It’s important to us not just to make beautiful things but not to
take advantage of anyone in the process of producing them. This also allows us
to keep carefully track of the many details involved and assure you are getting
the best possible garment.</p>
<p>Good ideas don’t work without a plan to make
it real. We have the team, we have the expertise, we even have the corporate
infrastructure already in place. But now…we need YOU! To bring these designs
from the drawing to board to your closet we need to raise funds to launch the
online marketplace, spend the time it takes to perfect the patterns, and
oversea every detail of their production and distribution. We need you to join our
Council of Consulting Clothiers!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Obviously, some cool new clothes! You will be the very
first to see the Historica vision become reality, and you will look amazing
doing it! PLUS as we reach each <a href=""#stretchgoals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stretch goal</a> we are also giving away some great perks! Your choice of some cool accessories to compliment your new outfit. We raise more and you get more! A lot more!</p>
<p>Why buy from us now? </p>
<p>We are creating limited edition versions of our
initial eight styles – each one includes a signed and numbered label on our
signature smuggler’s pocket, labeling you a member of our Council of Consulting
Clothiers. Furthermore, everyone who orders one or more of the first styles will
receive a personalized invitation to the Council: our private development group.

<p>We are also offering entry-level perks to
accommodate those who want to support us but for one reason or another aren’t
ready to buy our clothes. </p>

fruition? Spread the word! Have friends who love clothes and looking for more
unique styles with real personality? Send them to us! Know someone who could
use a little nudge in the style department? Send them to us! Know other people who

Dress it up with jacket and French cuffed shirt -- nothing says attention to detail like cufflinks. Our classic men’s waistcoat includes a few unique details including a notched back collar and triangle gusset in the bottom back which, along with the belt allows you to adjust for the perfect fit. Always thinking about the practical aspects of fashion, we’ve included 4 pockets – 3 welt pockets on the outside and our signature, interior ‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for a bus pass, or cell phone. If you have the spirit of the dandy in you the upper chest pocket is perfect for a pocket square, or use the lower pocket for that heirloom pocket watch.</p><p>Learn the lesson of Dorian Grey -- eternal youth is beyond our grasp; but truly fine clothes are timeless!

<p>When the Young Pretender rode onto the
field the clansmen exchanged looks between them. He didn't look much like a
king, with his thin limbs, his large soft eyes, and small chin. His uniform was
prefect cut, but looked as if it had never seen a day in the field ere now. He
wore the beautifully made broadsword at his hip awkwardly, as if unused to its
weight. This was Charles Stuart, the man who claimed he would liberate the
clans from the tyranny of England? </p>
<p>They watched intently as the Lochiel,
chief of the clan, approached the Pretender on foot. Half again his breadth,
and made the larger dressed in great kilt and bonnet, his sword and targe worn
with a practiced ease, there could not have much less in common between the
Stuart heir and Donald Cameron. For four hundred years, since the days of
Robert the Bruce and his glorious victory over the hated Sassenach at the field
of Bannockburn, Kings of Scotland had turned to Clan Cameron to be their strong
swords in battle. Would the Lochiel draw his sword for the pale boy prince who
came now before him? </p>
<p>The prince's horse paces nervously, as
the pale boy exchanged words with the ruddy clan-chief, their words lost in the
whipping, coastal wind. The men waited anxiously. At last, the Lochiel nodded
and took two steps back from the boy-prince on his tall, pale horse. Turning
toward the clansmen, Donald Cameron - the Cameron of Clan Cameron - drew his
sword and held it aloft; its bright blade flickering in the grey light of a
Scottish morning.</p>
<p>""Men of Cameron, loyal Jacobites,
this is Charles, Grandson of James Stuart, Sixth of that name and rightful king
of Scotland. As we fought the Longshanks, Cromwell and the men of Argyll
before, I call ye now to war...."" 
He said more, he must have said more, but none could hear over the wind,
and the cheers from a thousand throats as swords were drawn and musket butts
beat on the ground. ""For Charlie, King of Scotland! For the Lochiel! For
Cameron! For glory!""</p>
<p><b>The
Cameron Long Weskit</b></p>
<p>The final Jacobite uprising, led by
Bonnie Prince Charlie and shattered by Redcoat guns on the fields of Culloden,
is one of those ""what if"" moments of history that has inspired poets,
artists and authors for generations. We honor the romantic, passionate image of
the brave Gael with this 18th-century inspired weskit.  From the standing back collar and turned back
lapels to the back button detail (which also has the advantage of giving you an
adjustable fit). The Cameron works well as a stand alone piece or layered under a
dress coat. The longer length, top stitched, six button front and flap pockets
gives it a slightly more ‘dressed-up’ feel than your standard vest but is also
great with jeans a favorite pair of boots. On the practical side of things
we’ve also included four pockets, three exterior and our signature, interior
‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for a ID, or cell phone. May we
suggest a carnation or silk pocket square for the upper breast pocket? </p>
<p>At home with trousers or your finest
kilt - both traditional and modern. Men’s sizes S – XXL, but there nothing to
say it wouldn't look smashing on the saucy highway women. Proudly made in

hard, but fair and with a concern for the boys, in his way."" It was always
the same: by this point the nosiest mess was silent and  I had the complete attention of all present.

none might know who he was. But he stood there, with that broad tricorn on, his
boots bright polished, and wearing that long, frockcoat, the right sleeve
pinned up where hi s arm had been. And you know what he said? He said, <i>Nay gentlemen. In
honour I gained them, and in honour I will die with them.</i>"" </p>
<p>There was a round of collective sighs. ""Aye,
and so he did lads, and so he did. But not before he gave the Frenchie a
beating they'd never forget. So raise your cups to Admiral Horatio Nelson, a
Norfolk man and hero such as will never be forgotten!""</p>
<p>We have chosen to
name our reimagining of the long dress coat after one of the most romantic and
gallant figures of the 18th century, Horatio Nelson, England's greatest naval
hero, who tragically lost his life even as he was winning his greatest victory
off the coasts of Trafalgar.</p>
<p><b>Horatio Long Dress Coat</b></p>
<p>The last years of the
Enlightenment were a time of new ideas, bold actions and larger-than-life
figures. The ""noble experiment"" of the American Revolution, the
blood-soaked Terror of the French Revolution, and the long and valiant battles
to prevent the Emperor Napoleon from conquering all of Europe. Bold eras often
have bold fashions, and none more so than the gentleman's long dress coat,
which grew out of military fashion. From the stand-up collar with pointed back
seaming and turned back lapels to the twin back pleats, diagonal once piece
cuff detail and longer length you will not find another more uniquely
flattering coat. And its useful too – with three exterior and two interior
pockets (including one than buttons closed to secure you valuables and our signature, interior
‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for a money clip or cell phone).</p>
<p>A
dashing and elegant choice for the discerning gentleman equally at home worn
with fedora and tie, waistcoat and dress pants or jeans a comfortable weekend
shirt. Men’s sizes S – XXL.

London; that fog-shrouded time when night and dawn walk hand-in-hand. A tall
hat appears in the mist, accompanied by the crisp click of a brass-capped
walking stick striking against the cobbles. You squint through wet lashes to
see the face of that fine figure in the long, greatcoat. It's no avail, but as
he draws closer you hear a rich baritone sing….(to the tune of Mack the Knife)</p>
<p>♪♪ Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear<br/><span>And it shows them pearly white,<br/>
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, dear<br/>
And he keeps it, out of sight... </span>♪♪</p>
<p>Your heart quickens in
your throat. <i>Macheath</i>? The gentleman
thief of London? The cane clicks, the voice grows louder, he's nearly upon you
and there's no time to run. Lord or highwayman, gentleman or rogue, one thing
is for certain -- that is a mighty fine coat he wears.</p>
<p>Named for the dashing, swashbuckling
highwayman of <i>The Three Penny Opera</i>,
our greatcoat evokes an era when gentlemen set off for business <i>and</i> pleasure looking their best. Armed
with a top hat, gloves and a well-knotted, silk scarf, a proper top coat did
more than protect their finery from the rain - it was finery itself.</p>
<p><b>Macheath Greatcoat</b></p>
<p>As it was then, so it can
be now!  The Macheath Greatcoat combines
all of the classic elements of Victorian, manly elegance with touches of modern
flare. Made with plenty of pockets to stow your conveniences in (two large
outside pockets in the side seams and three interior pocket, including our
signature  ‘smugglers pocket’ – just the
right size for a jackkni…er…business cards or cell phone and two large pockets
that button closed). Our Greatcoat has a full caplet to help ward off the worst
of the weather that is sewn in to the front seams to keep it from flapping back
in your face. The front button tab detail covers a hidden zipper for easy
on/off and has the added advantage of buttoning the collar snugly around your
neck. We included generous turned back cuffs, for that extra bit of flare and
two sets of pleats in the back that provide fullness that flares dramatically
with the breeze.</p>
<p>A stylish <i>and</i> practical choice for the discerning
roustabout in you. Men’s sizes S – XXL, but there nothing to say it wouldn't
look smashing on the saucy highway women.

<p></p>
<p><i>There was Manderley,
our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone

<p>Since 1938, the opening lines of Daphne DuMaurier's <i>Rebecca</i> has taken readers by the hand
into one of the great, gothic romances of all time. But for incurable

elegance of 1940's fashion? </p>

snug ‘kitten’ dress, or with a favorite hat, jeans and boots for a weekend
adventuring outfit. The low cut shawl collar and ‘nipped in,’ double-breasted
waist closure do nothing but flatter your curves. The fully tailored lines
include princess seams front and back for smooth fit all finished off by a belt
in back for final fit adjustments. We’ve heard the outcry ‘women need pockets,

Jillian? Our friends at the Urban Dictionary knew best:</p>
<p><i>Jillian is an incredible friend, who's loyal and won't stab
you in the back. She has an amazing sense of humor and loves to laugh and have
a good time. She may come up with some ideas that simple minded humans cannot
see the point or concept, these ideas takes someone else who's name shares the
same magnitude as hers. Hot/sexy would also be another good term to address her
appearance. Her intelligence is far beyond anything a simple mind can
understand so don't even try to venture down that road. Simply put Jillian is
awesome for lack of a better word.</i></p>
<p>Loyal...sexy....intelligent...awesome.
Yes, that is exactly how you'll feel when you slip our Jillian on. And just
like the Urban Dictionary, we promise that she won't let you down!</p>
<p><b>Jillian Laced Tunic/ Waistcoat</b></p>
<p>Designed to flatter
your most feminine curves and a touch of the east in her front closure frogs –
she performs the miracle of a tailored look and a ‘custom’ fit that is
instantly alterable with her back lacing. Jillian is a lady with as many
personalities as places in your wardrobe - as a sleeveless jacket for a more
polished look, a vest layered over a flouncy dress for that added touch of
flare or a tunic to wear with jeans and your favorite weekend boots.  She’s practical, too because as always we’ve

sweeps the city with its bloody broom.</p>
<p>As those high and low who
challenge the new regime are marched to the guillotine, only the mysterious
Scarlet Pimpernel stands against the madness. His allies come from all walks of
life, but none more alluring than Marguerite St. Just, a beautiful French
actress, who, entranced by the Pimpernel's exploits, forces herself into his
circle. </p>
<p>Marguerite's misfortune was
to be the wife of the wealthy English fop Sir Percy Blakeney,
a baronet whose only real accomplishment is his ability to be forever
impressed with his own wit. Contemptuous of her cowardly and unloving
husband, she's acted in the Pimpernel's interests alone, only to find
herself blackmailed: reveal the identity of the Pimpernel or see her brother
die.  With nowhere else to turn, she confides in the useless Sir Percy and
learns a stunning truth -- <i>he</i> is the
Scarlet Pimpernel!</p>
<p>How will Sir Percy and
Marguerite escape the villainous Chauvelin's clutches? How can a bit of pepper
in a gift snuff box prove an evil man's undoing? You will feel ready to live
that adventure yourself when you slip into Marguerite, a frockcoat that brings
the elegance of 1800 Paris into the Twenty-first Century world. </p>
<p><b>Marguerite
Frockcoat</b></p>
<p>From her unique pointed
lapel, to her lavishly full cascading skirts, Marguerite is a show stopper. A
touch of a men’s frockcoat at the back waist with her twin buttons and princess
seam pleats which someone how makes you look at that more feminine (what is
about women in men’s styles that is so flattering?). Her crisp, tailored
shoulders that widen into flared cuffs that are slit to show off the cuff of
your blouse. Ever the pragmatic figure she also has three pockets, two generous
side pockets in the skirts and our
interior signature ‘smugglers’ pocket just the right size for a delicate, laced
edged hanky or cell phone. </p>
Murder.
Blackmail. Intrigue. A ravishing beauty. All of this and true love saved by
pepper? Our lady's frockcoat will bring you all the dramatic flare, without the
risk of losing your head! (We can't say the same for that someone special who
sees you wrapped in our Marguerite's embrace!) Women’s sizes S – XXL. (Consider how you might
want to layer this piece when you choosing a size – she looks rather stunning
when layered with a waistcoat like our Rebecca.) <span>Proudly

We’ve included lots of delightful details – generous front pockets (set flatteringly on the diagonal) as well as a dainty watch pocket, handy for loose change or perfect for accessorizing with a pocket watch. The Bronte’s full sleeves have the added function of making you waist look that much smaller as do the flared skirts. The fully lined interior includes a large stoables pocket as well as our signature ‘smugglers’ pocket just the right size for cell phone or business cards. Finished with topstitching on collar and turned back cuffs for crispness and a nice kick-slit in the back for ease of walking.  If your one true love’s heart doesn’t skip a beat when they see you in this….well, it will.</p><p>Women’s sizes S – XXL, consider how you might want to layer this piece when you choosing a size.

<p><b>How
do I pick my size, color, stretch goal perk, etc?</b></p>
<p>No worries! Here is how Indiegogo works: we receive
your contact information when you contribute, and after the campaign, we'll
reach out to have you confirm all the details of your order.  </p>
<p><b>Can
I change my order?</b></p>
<p>We are making each of these limited edition garments
just for you. As our introductory line these are virtually one-of-kinds made for you - we won't know until the campaign ends which styles will become part of our permanent line. What we are offering here won't necessarily be representative of what will be our regular stock
on our website so we won’t have extra stock to be able to switch your choice or
accept exchanges. So choose carefully. </p>
<p><b>Can
I order custom sizes or colors?</b></p>
<p>In a word, no. In order to be able to offer you
great, original clothes at these prices we need to use economies of scale in
production which means there needs to be some uniformity and limits to colors
and sizes. But these are well made, tailored garments with real seam allowance
so if you need a few tweaks like the waist taken in, a hem lengthened, etc –
they are made to be alterable just like men’s suits and can be custom fit you
by your local alterations shop – which is only way to get that ‘made for you’
fit.</p>
<p><b>When
will I receive what I bought?</b></p>
<p>The second the campaign ends, January 31<sup>st</sup>,
we start collating the results and finding out exactly what you’d like us to
make. We then go into production the second week in February with the aim to
ship them out to you by the end of March.</p><p>
</p><p><b>Can
you explain about the cost of the garments?</b></p>
<p>We're facing several challenges which contribute to
the bottom line of our styles: we produce locally, just outside of Chicago, USA
(which is necessary to properly oversee all the details of production and make
sure it gets made well but is costly), we're not producing in huge numbers like
the big brands out there (which means higher cost per garment); and everyone
involved in our process makes a living wage, is treated well and works in good
working conditions (we are committed to working with partners that treat their
workers fairly).</p>
<p>In the end, the Historica Clothiers that has all the
features that the major labels do (actually allot more detail than most mass
produced clothing), and, despite the challenges our products are competitively
priced with equivalent pieces – that is the few out there that are actually
producing well-made, well-cut, full featured clothing. That is, made of 100%
wool with details like real pockets, full lining, under-stitched hems and sleeve
caps – all things that add to the look, functionality and life of each garment.</p>
<p><b>Why
is International Shipping so expensive?</b></p>
<p>The simple answer is these are our shipping costs –
we aren’t making any money on in it. The last few years shipping costs have
risen dramatically. We’re sorry. We love having customers all over the world.</p>

on a mission to bring stylish self-expression to your personal wardrobe.
Honestly,
the secret is simple: Your clothes should make you look good, feel good, endure
the whimsy of current trends and add to your mode of personal expression. 
I’m Nicole
Allen, the lead designer for Historica Clothiers and for decades I’ve been
telling stories about myself through fashion. Getting dressed each morning is the
most obvious form of self-expression you will engage in all day. Clothes may
not make the man but they certainly tell a wordless story. Your personal style
can be an expression of your dreams, mood or fantasies (secret or otherwise). My
hobbies relate to long held fantasies of my own: to dance, swordfight, wear
armor, be a musician, paint, ride horses, and become a professional designer.
But long before any of that became a reality, I created outfits that expressed
the artist, fashion designer, dancer, rider and martial artist I didn't know I
would become. Everywhere I've gone in the world, I’ve been told, 'I love
what you are wearing, but I could never dress like that.’ 
Nonsense!

Historica
Clothing exists to give you permission, options, inspiration and confidence to
express yourself sartorially. We are creating fashion that's not just something
to wear, but an experience that people want to share. For each piece in our
line we’ve given you a storyline, a way to invite you into to another world,
but the real point is for you to make it your own, and create your own story. 
The concept
of crowd-funded fashion is a thing whose time has come. We believe the key to
designing clothing people feel they must
wear, is to ask what they have dreamt
of wearing. We’ve developed our first styles with a select group of folks just
like you – people who saw a need for more colorful, expressive clothing in
their lives. We call them our (cue the drumroll) Council of Consulting
Clothiers. 
You don’t
need permission. Don’t dress like everyone else; step out of the mold and bring
a new level of creativity and style to your personal image!


Who We Are and What This Campaign Will Allow Us to Do:

We’re
launching the line with this campaign in order to fund the creation of initial
line  - four styles each for men and
women. We’ve chosen to start with tailored garments because they provide the
most versatile, lasting, flattering styles – signature pieces that will become
staples in your wardrobe and can be used both dressed up and dressed down.
Making these patterns is a painstaking process, where we pick apart fit and
drape of each style (as analyzed on real people in real sizes, not fantasy fit
models). My team and I are credentialed, professional designers and personal
clothiers that have been working in the online fashion business for over ten
years. We know how to both create patterns that fit and flatter all body types,
and how to present them online with tons of photos and fit details – you can
trust these to be WYSIWIG designs, not the “bait and switch” we’ve all
experienced shopping online. 
All of our
pieces are produced locally, here in Chicago, and everyone involved makes a
fair wage. It’s important to us not just to make beautiful things but not to
take advantage of anyone in the process of producing them. This also allows us
to keep carefully track of the many details involved and assure you are getting
the best possible garment.
Good ideas don’t work without a plan to make
it real. We have the team, we have the expertise, we even have the corporate
infrastructure already in place. But now…we need YOU! To bring these designs
from the drawing to board to your closet we need to raise funds to launch the
online marketplace, spend the time it takes to perfect the patterns, and
oversea every detail of their production and distribution. We need you to join our
Council of Consulting Clothiers!

The very picture of the English gentleman, with the countenance of youth and smoldering, ancient eyes. At once, the partygoers set to whispering. ""Is that, him?""""They say he inherited Lord Wotton's fortune.""""They say he's indulged in a thousand passions.""""They say, he never ages...""Lost in gossip, they did not realize the subject of their whispers was amongst them, until he bid them good evening. Embarrassed looks and nervous smiles, until Rothschild broke the awkward silence. ""I say, old chap, it has been years and you haven't changed a whit!The young man smiled coyly, and fingered his fine waistcoat, ""You are too kind. I just have an excellent tailor.""Rothschild laughed, ""Nonsense!  You look as fresh as the day you had that portrait painted by...what was that lad's name again?""""Hallward. Basil Hallward.""""That's him! Odd, nervous fellow. Wasn't a bit surprised when he disappeared. I swear, Mr. Gray, that was the most uncanny bit of art I've ever seen! As if it were your living twin!

Cameron

Scotland, August 1745
When the Young Pretender rode onto the
field the clansmen exchanged looks between them. He didn't look much like a
king, with his thin limbs, his large soft eyes, and small chin. His uniform was
prefect cut, but looked as if it had never seen a day in the field ere now. He
wore the beautifully made broadsword at his hip awkwardly, as if unused to its
weight. This was Charles Stuart, the man who claimed he would liberate the
clans from the tyranny of England? 
They watched intently as the Lochiel,
chief of the clan, approached the Pretender on foot. Half again his breadth,
and made the larger dressed in great kilt and bonnet, his sword and targe worn
with a practiced ease, there could not have much less in common between the
Stuart heir and Donald Cameron. For four hundred years, since the days of
Robert the Bruce and his glorious victory over the hated Sassenach at the field
of Bannockburn, Kings of Scotland had turned to Clan Cameron to be their strong
swords in battle. Would the Lochiel draw his sword for the pale boy prince who
came now before him? 
The prince's horse paces nervously, as
the pale boy exchanged words with the ruddy clan-chief, their words lost in the
whipping, coastal wind. The men waited anxiously. At last, the Lochiel nodded
and took two steps back from the boy-prince on his tall, pale horse. Turning
toward the clansmen, Donald Cameron - the Cameron of Clan Cameron - drew his
sword and held it aloft; its bright blade flickering in the grey light of a
Scottish morning.
""Men of Cameron, loyal Jacobites,
this is Charles, Grandson of James Stuart, Sixth of that name and rightful king
of Scotland. As we fought the Longshanks, Cromwell and the men of Argyll
before, I call ye now to war...."" 
He said more, he must have said more, but none could hear over the wind,
and the cheers from a thousand throats as swords were drawn and musket butts
beat on the ground. ""For Charlie, King of Scotland! For the Lochiel! For
Cameron! For glory!""
The
Cameron Long Weskit
The final Jacobite uprising, led by
Bonnie Prince Charlie and shattered by Redcoat guns on the fields of Culloden,
is one of those ""what if"" moments of history that has inspired poets,
artists and authors for generations. We honor the romantic, passionate image of
the brave Gael with this 18th-century inspired weskit.  From the standing back collar and turned back
lapels to the back button detail (which also has the advantage of giving you an
adjustable fit). The Cameron works well as a stand alone piece or layered under a
dress coat. The longer length, top stitched, six button front and flap pockets
gives it a slightly more ‘dressed-up’ feel than your standard vest but is also
great with jeans a favorite pair of boots. On the practical side of things
we’ve also included four pockets, three exterior and our signature, interior
‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for a ID, or cell phone. May we
suggest a carnation or silk pocket square for the upper breast pocket? 
At home with trousers or your finest
kilt - both traditional and modern. Men’s sizes S – XXL, but there nothing to
say it wouldn't look smashing on the saucy highway women. Proudly made in

Horatio

""You sailed with Nelson?"" It
was the kind of question that was asked with awe, from the lowliest shipman to
a captain of the line. ""What was he really like?""
""What can I say lads? Nelson was
all you imagined and more. Tall and regal, fearless and bold. Exacting and
hard, but fair and with a concern for the boys, in his way."" It was always
the same: by this point the nosiest mess was silent and  I had the complete attention of all present.
""I met him first after Toloun, just before we took Corsica from Bonaparte,
and was with ever after - Cadiz, the Nile....right on to that hard day at
Trafalgar.""
And then, always the same questions,
""Is it true the sniper 'it 'im cause 'e wouldn't take off 'is
colors?""
""Oh tis
true, lads, tis true. His officers bade him take off his admiral's stars that
none might know who he was. But he stood there, with that broad tricorn on, his
boots bright polished, and wearing that long, frockcoat, the right sleeve
pinned up where hi s arm had been. And you know what he said? He said, Nay gentlemen. In
honour I gained them, and in honour I will die with them."" 
There was a round of collective sighs. ""Aye,
and so he did lads, and so he did. But not before he gave the Frenchie a
beating they'd never forget. So raise your cups to Admiral Horatio Nelson, a
Norfolk man and hero such as will never be forgotten!""
We have chosen to
name our reimagining of the long dress coat after one of the most romantic and
gallant figures of the 18th century, Horatio Nelson, England's greatest naval
hero, who tragically lost his life even as he was winning his greatest victory
off the coasts of Trafalgar.
Horatio Long Dress Coat
The last years of the
Enlightenment were a time of new ideas, bold actions and larger-than-life
figures. The ""noble experiment"" of the American Revolution, the
blood-soaked Terror of the French Revolution, and the long and valiant battles
to prevent the Emperor Napoleon from conquering all of Europe. Bold eras often
have bold fashions, and none more so than the gentleman's long dress coat,
which grew out of military fashion. From the stand-up collar with pointed back
seaming and turned back lapels to the twin back pleats, diagonal once piece
cuff detail and longer length you will not find another more uniquely
flattering coat. And its useful too – with three exterior and two interior
pockets (including one than buttons closed to secure you valuables and our signature, interior
‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for a money clip or cell phone).

dashing and elegant choice for the discerning gentleman equally at home worn

Macheath
A rainy day in Old
London; that fog-shrouded time when night and dawn walk hand-in-hand. A tall
hat appears in the mist, accompanied by the crisp click of a brass-capped
walking stick striking against the cobbles. You squint through wet lashes to
see the face of that fine figure in the long, greatcoat. It's no avail, but as
he draws closer you hear a rich baritone sing….(to the tune of Mack the Knife)
♪♪ Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dearAnd it shows them pearly white,
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, dear
And he keeps it, out of sight... ♪♪
Your heart quickens in
your throat. Macheath? The gentleman
thief of London? The cane clicks, the voice grows louder, he's nearly upon you
and there's no time to run. Lord or highwayman, gentleman or rogue, one thing
is for certain -- that is a mighty fine coat he wears.
Named for the dashing, swashbuckling
highwayman of The Three Penny Opera,
our greatcoat evokes an era when gentlemen set off for business and pleasure looking their best. Armed
with a top hat, gloves and a well-knotted, silk scarf, a proper top coat did
more than protect their finery from the rain - it was finery itself.
Macheath Greatcoat
As it was then, so it can
be now!  The Macheath Greatcoat combines
all of the classic elements of Victorian, manly elegance with touches of modern
flare. Made with plenty of pockets to stow your conveniences in (two large
outside pockets in the side seams and three interior pocket, including our
signature  ‘smugglers pocket’ – just the
right size for a jackkni…er…business cards or cell phone and two large pockets
that button closed). Our Greatcoat has a full caplet to help ward off the worst
of the weather that is sewn in to the front seams to keep it from flapping back
in your face. The front button tab detail covers a hidden zipper for easy
on/off and has the added advantage of buttoning the collar snugly around your
neck. We included generous turned back cuffs, for that extra bit of flare and
two sets of pleats in the back that provide fullness that flares dramatically
with the breeze.
A stylish and practical choice for the discerning
roustabout in you. Men’s sizes S – XXL, but there nothing to say it wouldn't
look smashing on the saucy highway women. Proudly made in Chi-Town, USA.Shipping within the US $23, International Shipping $55See Size Chart and Color Information
Rebecca
Last night I dreamt I
went to Manderley again... 

I came upon it
suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that
spread in all directions... 

There was Manderley,
our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone
shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the
green lawns and terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those
walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.
Since 1938, the opening lines of Daphne DuMaurier's Rebecca has taken readers by the hand
into one of the great, gothic romances of all time. But for incurable
romantics, Rebecca shall forever be the beautiful Joan Fontaine in Hitchock's
1940 masterpiece. What better name then for a waistcoat that brings back the dramatic
elegance of 1940's fashion? 

Rebecca Waistcoat
As the ultimate layering piece, our
Rebecca can sass-up any style: from office wear to a night on the town. You
will; find it equally at place with blouse and dress pants, over your favorite
snug ‘kitten’ dress, or with a favorite hat, jeans and boots for a weekend
adventuring outfit. The low cut shawl collar and ‘nipped in,’ double-breasted
waist closure do nothing but flatter your curves. The fully tailored lines
include princess seams front and back for smooth fit all finished off by a belt
in back for final fit adjustments. We’ve heard the outcry ‘women need pockets,
too!’ and so we’ve included 3 pockets – 2 welt pocket
on the outside a nice place for dainty pocket watch) and our signature interior
‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for a credit card or cell phone.
Our Rebecca may not unite
you with your heart’s desire, but you will never
be mistaken for someone else. Women’s sizes S – XXL. Proudly made in Chi-Town,

Jillian
What can you say about
Jillian? Our friends at the Urban Dictionary knew best:
Jillian is an incredible friend, who's loyal and won't stab
you in the back. She has an amazing sense of humor and loves to laugh and have
a good time. She may come up with some ideas that simple minded humans cannot
see the point or concept, these ideas takes someone else who's name shares the
same magnitude as hers. Hot/sexy would also be another good term to address her
appearance. Her intelligence is far beyond anything a simple mind can
understand so don't even try to venture down that road. Simply put Jillian is
awesome for lack of a better word.
Loyal...sexy....intelligent...awesome.
Yes, that is exactly how you'll feel when you slip our Jillian on. And just
like the Urban Dictionary, we promise that she won't let you down!
Jillian Laced Tunic/ Waistcoat
Designed to flatter
your most feminine curves and a touch of the east in her front closure frogs –
she performs the miracle of a tailored look and a ‘custom’ fit that is
instantly alterable with her back lacing. Jillian is a lady with as many
personalities as places in your wardrobe - as a sleeveless jacket for a more
polished look, a vest layered over a flouncy dress for that added touch of
flare or a tunic to wear with jeans and your favorite weekend boots.  She’s practical, too because as always we’ve
included our
signature interior ‘smugglers pocket’ – just the right size for your cell phone
or to save that napkin with the impromptu number on it.

serve you well in all your endeavors – especially the ones that make you want
to stand out a crowd. Women’s sizes S – XXL. Proudly made in Chi-Town, USA. Shipping within the US $15, International Shipping $45See Size Chart and Color Information
Marguerite
Paris, 1792 - The Terror
sweeps the city with its bloody broom.
As those high and low who
challenge the new regime are marched to the guillotine, only the mysterious
Scarlet Pimpernel stands against the madness. His allies come from all walks of
life, but none more alluring than Marguerite St. Just, a beautiful French
actress, who, entranced by the Pimpernel's exploits, forces herself into his
circle. 
Marguerite's misfortune was
to be the wife of the wealthy English fop Sir Percy Blakeney,
a baronet whose only real accomplishment is his ability to be forever
impressed with his own wit. Contemptuous of her cowardly and unloving
husband, she's acted in the Pimpernel's interests alone, only to find
herself blackmailed: reveal the identity of the Pimpernel or see her brother
die.  With nowhere else to turn, she confides in the useless Sir Percy and
learns a stunning truth -- he is the
Scarlet Pimpernel!
How will Sir Percy and
Marguerite escape the villainous Chauvelin's clutches? How can a bit of pepper
in a gift snuff box prove an evil man's undoing? You will feel ready to live
that adventure yourself when you slip into Marguerite, a frockcoat that brings
the elegance of 1800 Paris into the Twenty-first Century world. 
Marguerite
Frockcoat
From her unique pointed
lapel, to her lavishly full cascading skirts, Marguerite is a show stopper. A
touch of a men’s frockcoat at the back waist with her twin buttons and princess
seam pleats which someone how makes you look at that more feminine (what is
about women in men’s styles that is so flattering?). Her crisp, tailored
shoulders that widen into flared cuffs that are slit to show off the cuff of
your blouse. Ever the pragmatic figure she also has three pockets, two generous
side pockets in the skirts and our
interior signature ‘smugglers’ pocket just the right size for a delicate, laced
edged hanky or cell phone. 
Murder.
Blackmail. Intrigue. A ravishing beauty. All of this and true love saved by
pepper? Our lady's frockcoat will bring you all the dramatic flare, without the
risk of losing your head! (We can't say the same for that someone special who
sees you wrapped in our Marguerite's embrace!) Women’s sizes S – XXL. (Consider how you might
want to layer this piece when you choosing a size – she looks rather stunning
when layered with a waistcoat like our Rebecca.) Proudly

His governess? A woman whose family had squandered all station, whose girls had lost all prospects? That was not why he had had them fetch her to Thornfield Hall! Well, if she came, he would tell her, ""I am sorry, my dear Jane, but a madness overcame me."" Yes, that was for the best...But those words were never to reach his lips for the thought died the moment he spied her. A shy, but proud woman, she walked with nervous determination, the long skirts of her coat swaying from side to sided as she picked her way doggedly across the green. He could see her stop to scan the countryside -- seeking, seeking him.Even from there, their eyes met and he was lost. His feet had a mind of his own as he tore across the heather, ""oh my darling, darling girl....""Charlotte. Emily. Anne. The Brontë sisters were not romance writers; they wrote the novels that defined for generations what high romance was all about! Elegance and passion, but always with proper manners and just the right touch of reserve; that's what defined these amazing women and their writing, and we've tried to give them a namesake that matches.  Bright, determined women overcoming incredible odds to find happiness with their one, true love – a coat just like this. The Brontë coatdress is one of most contemporary, yet evocative garments that, just like one Charlotte's heroines, can face all manner of challenges.Brontë CoatdressIs it is a coat, is it a dress? The answer is yes. With all the fit detail of the best tailored garments and the flattering lines from gowns of years past – this style is flexible and useful in the best sense – layered with a blouse and waistcoat, over your favorite cocktail dress or worn alone, buttoned up. We’ve included lots of delightful details – generous front pockets (set flatteringly on the diagonal) as well as a dainty watch pocket, handy for loose change or perfect for accessorizing with a pocket watch. The Bronte’s full sleeves have the added function of making you waist look that much smaller as do the flared skirts. The fully lined interior includes a large stoables pocket as well as our signature ‘smugglers’ pocket just the right size for cell phone or business cards. Finished with topstitching on collar and turned back cuffs for crispness and a nice kick-slit in the back for ease of walking.  If your one true love’s heart doesn’t skip a beat when they see you in this….well, it will.Women’s sizes S – XXL, consider how you might want to layer this piece when you choosing a size.

How
do I pick my size, color, stretch goal perk, etc?
No worries! Here is how Indiegogo works: we receive
your contact information when you contribute, and after the campaign, we'll
reach out to have you confirm all the details of your order.  
Can
I change my order?
We are making each of these limited edition garments
just for you. As our introductory line these are virtually one-of-kinds made for you - we won't know until the campaign ends which styles will become part of our permanent line. What we are offering here won't necessarily be representative of what will be our regular stock
on our website so we won’t have extra stock to be able to switch your choice or
accept exchanges. So choose carefully. 
Can
I order custom sizes or colors?
In a word, no. In order to be able to offer you
great, original clothes at these prices we need to use economies of scale in
production which means there needs to be some uniformity and limits to colors
and sizes. But these are well made, tailored garments with real seam allowance
so if you need a few tweaks like the waist taken in, a hem lengthened, etc –
they are made to be alterable just like men’s suits and can be custom fit you
by your local alterations shop – which is only way to get that ‘made for you’
fit.
When
will I receive what I bought?
The second the campaign ends, January 31st,
we start collating the results and finding out exactly what you’d like us to
make. We then go into production the second week in February with the aim to
ship them out to you by the end of March.
Can
you explain about the cost of the garments?
We're facing several challenges which contribute to
the bottom line of our styles: we produce locally, just outside of Chicago, USA
(which is necessary to properly oversee all the details of production and make
sure it gets made well but is costly), we're not producing in huge numbers like
the big brands out there (which means higher cost per garment); and everyone
involved in our process makes a living wage, is treated well and works in good
working conditions (we are committed to working with partners that treat their
workers fairly).
In the end, the Historica Clothiers that has all the
features that the major labels do (actually allot more detail than most mass
produced clothing), and, despite the challenges our products are competitively
priced with equivalent pieces – that is the few out there that are actually
producing well-made, well-cut, full featured clothing. That is, made of 100%
wool with details like real pockets, full lining, under-stitched hems and sleeve
caps – all things that add to the look, functionality and life of each garment.
Why
is International Shipping so expensive?
The simple answer is these are our shipping costs –
we aren’t making any money on in it. The last few years shipping costs have
risen dramatically. We’re sorry. We love having customers all over the world.

<p>Thank you for checking us out! </p>The UHDLT seed was planted a year and a half ago and has been growing rapidly thanks to the overwhelming support of so many people. While volunteer tutoring at a homeless shelter through an organization called <i>School on Wheels</i> my eyes were opened to the growing <i>digital divide</i> in our society. Students with incredible drive to persevere through adversity lacked the resources and knowledge needed to succeed in the computer-dependant world in which we now live. I wanted to help bridge this gap through blended learning programs that would not only teach these students the basic essential computer skills, but also open their minds to the wealth of knowledge and opportunities available to them through skillful navigation of the Internet. <p></p>
<p>I was inspired by the innovative concept of creating <i>shared value </i>to help fund this mission. </p>

<p>Christina joined my vision and we decided to create tablet and laptop cases that are so utterly awesome that the success of the UHDLT products would generate funding for the cause we are passionate about. After a year of working with industry veterans, the UHDLT collection has been perfected and is ready for launch! We are so excited to see where this idea will lead. <br/></p>

<p>UHDLT is our modification of the world ADULT (yes, pronounced
exactly the same). We believe in creating opportunities by breaking through
gates traditionally locked by conventional “wisdom.” We all have the ability to
blaze our own trails and sometimes the most untraditional experiences grant the
greatest rewards. We make UHDLT cases for the unconventional adult. </p>

<p>We at UHDLT are firm believers in the
incredible power of encouragement and this project would not be where it is
today without five special words. <i>SAY YES TO THE UNIVERSE</i> are the borrowed words of wisdom from a dear friend that got the UHDLT wheels turning. They are a reminder to not dwell on the negative, but rather think of all the positive possibilities that could stem from SAYING YES when the UNIVERSE presents you with an opportunity. Inspiration is infectious, which is why we want to share these special words with all of you. Stitched to the inside of every UHDLT case you will find your <i>SAY YES TO THE UNIVERSE</i> label as a daily reminder to live your life to the fullest, dream the grandest, and always<i>...</i></p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Q. I’m an Indiegogo novice. How does this work?</b><br/></p>
<p><i>A. So, basically, we post our project on Indiegogo’s site, set a funding
goal and tell you all about it. If you’re into it, you donate/pre-order our
product. After 45 days, when the campaign ends, we get to work! As soon as we
hit our funding goal, we will complete our first production run and be on our
way to becoming a successful socially conscious business working toward
education equality! Don’t worry, even if we don’t hit our goal, we will be
making enough cases to fulfill our contributor’s orders. But let’s be honest…
these cases and our cause are amazing and we are determined to make this dream
a reality!</i></p>
<p><b>Q. How do I follow UHDLT’s progress?</b></p>
<p><i>A. When you contribute to our campaign, you become part of our project! We will keep you updated on our progress through our mailing list and you can
email us directly with any questions or comments. You can also follow us on
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter @uhdlt. </i><i>A little inside scoop for ya…we’ll be
hosting Facebook contests to win a few free cases, so be sure to like our page at
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/UHDLT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/UHDLT</a>.</i></p>
<p><b>Q. Can I just donate?</b></p>
<p><i>A. Sure! Don’t have a laptop or tablet, but you believe in our mission
and want to help us reach our goal? Hit the ""Contribute
Now"" button on our page and donate however much you’d like. We really
appreciate your support! </i></p>
<p><b>Q. Can I buy an UHDLT case as a gift? </b></p>
<p><i>A. Of course! If you want us to ship a case as a gift just make sure you
include the giftee’s information as the shipping address. Also, we know the
holidays are quickly approaching and you may want to give an UHDLT case as a holiday gift, but they might not be ready in time. Not to fear. Let us know if your
pre-order is a gift and we will email you a little something-something that you
can either print out and wrap or send via email. </i></p>
<p><b>Q. Alright, my case is pre-ordered. Now what are some other ways I can
help?  </b></p>
<p><i>A. We're so glad you asked! We would love for you to make some noise
about our project to your friends. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to
share, tweet, post, and blog your little hearts out. It could even be a great
conversation starter for that cute boy or girl in class or at work you’ve been
meaning to talk to. Yep, you’re welcome. But seriously, you spreading the word
about our cases and our cause would mean the world to us!</i></p>
<p><b>Q. How long will it take to receive my case? I want it now! </b></p>
<p><i>A. Whoa, Veruca Salt. We are going to do our darndest to get these cases
to you as soon as possible, but we are a small company just starting out, so
your patience is GREATLY appreciated. Just so you have an idea, this is what
our production timeline looks like…</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175840/files/20131104181023-timeline-1.jpg?1383617423"" src="""" style=""""/><i></i></i></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""><i><i><i>It will take roughly 3 weeks once production begins to complete and ship 250 cases, so if you are within the first 1,000 contributors to order you can expect to receive your case sometime between February and March. </i></i></i></p>
<i><i>We will do everything in our power to expedite this process. </i></i><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. And shipping?</b></p>
<p><i>Note that we included the $5 domestic shipping cost in the REWARD price to make it
easier. </i></p>
<p><i>Domestic shipping – $5 if shipping anywhere within the United States. </i></p>
<p><i>If shipping internationally – $10 to Canada, $15 Worldwide. </i></p>
<p><i>*So please ADD $5 for Canada and please ADD $10 Worldwide. </i></p>
<p><b>Q. What
if I just can’t decide which one I want? </b></p>
<p><i>A. Perfectly
normal. We understand your dilemma. Lucky for you there is no limit to how many
cases you can order and with six unique designs you can show off a different one
almost every day of the week!</i></p>
<p><b>Q. Are you going to make more prints?</b></p>
<p><i>A. That’s the idea! We want to keep our cases fresh and
unique, so when our current stock of prints run out, we will be launching a
whole new line. Let me re-iterate that. When we run out of a print, we’re out. You
might want to go order your favorite NOW before it’s too late. </i></p>
<p><b>Q. How should I care for my case?</b></p>
<p><i>A. UHDLT cases can be easily spot-cleaned with soap and a moist towel. </i></p>
<p><b>Q. How do I choose my size and style?</b></p>
<p><i>A. The REWARDS section is divided
by each style and size. So if you really want The Havana and you own a 13”
laptop, look for the reward box titled The Havana 13” Case. It’s that simple. </i></p>
<p><b>Q. How
do I know my case will fit my tablet/laptop?</b></p>
<p><i>A. This
is pretty important. Our cases were designed to fit iPads, 13” MacBook Pros and
15” MacBook Pros comfortably. If you own any of those products, you’re good to go. But even if you aren’t an Apple-ite, we may still have something for you. Just check the
dimensions below and please <b>make sure your device will fit WELL WITHIN the dimensions of our cases. </b></i></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q.

Thank you for checking us out! The UHDLT seed was planted a year and a half ago and has been growing rapidly thanks to the overwhelming support of so many people. While volunteer tutoring at a homeless shelter through an organization called School on Wheels my eyes were opened to the growing digital divide in our society. Students with incredible drive to persevere through adversity lacked the resources and knowledge needed to succeed in the computer-dependant world in which we now live. I wanted to help bridge this gap through blended learning programs that would not only teach these students the basic essential computer skills, but also open their minds to the wealth of knowledge and opportunities available to them through skillful navigation of the Internet. 
I was inspired by the innovative concept of creating shared value to help fund this mission. 




Christina joined my vision and we decided to create tablet and laptop cases that are so utterly awesome that the success of the UHDLT products would generate funding for the cause we are passionate about. After a year of working with industry veterans, the UHDLT collection has been perfected and is ready for launch! We are so excited to see where this idea will lead. 



xoxo, Jen and Christina








Check out the GALLERY tab above for more photos of your favorite case!
















UHDLT cases are made locally in California by a woman-owned manufacturing company (how rad is that?!). And we are launching EXCLUSIVELY on Indiegogo, so this is your opportunity to not only receive one of these bad boys, but to play a key role in making this idea a reality. 


• 
For a donation
of $35 you will receive a tablet case in the style of your choice. 
• 
For a donation
of $42 you will receive a 13"" or 15"" laptop case in the style of your
choice. 
Check out the
REWARDS column to your right for more details! Shipping within the United States is $5 and has already been added to each reward box. For Canada please include an additional $5; all other countries worldwide please add $10. 






KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. We donate 25% of our profits to School
on Wheels to help fund their new Blended Learning program. And as our
company grows we CANNOT WAIT to watch School
on Wheels and their innovative programs grow with us!

Your purchase is not just giving a thing, it's planting a dream.













UHDLT is our modification of the world ADULT (yes, pronounced
exactly the same). We believe in creating opportunities by breaking through
gates traditionally locked by conventional “wisdom.” We all have the ability to
blaze our own trails and sometimes the most untraditional experiences grant the
greatest rewards. We make UHDLT cases for the unconventional adult. 












We at UHDLT are firm believers in the
incredible power of encouragement and this project would not be where it is
today without five special words. SAY YES TO THE UNIVERSE are the borrowed words of wisdom from a dear friend that got the UHDLT wheels turning. They are a reminder to not dwell on the negative, but rather think of all the positive possibilities that could stem from SAYING YES when the UNIVERSE presents you with an opportunity. Inspiration is infectious, which is why we want to share these special words with all of you. Stitched to the inside of every UHDLT case you will find your SAY YES TO THE UNIVERSE label as a daily reminder to live your life to the fullest, dream the grandest, and always...




Thank you to everyone who has helped get UHDLT to where it is today!
Models: The drop-dead gorgeous Kayla Maciel, Prysilla Martiz, Ana Anvari, Summer Hume, and many make-you-aww-they're-so-adorable kids
Photographer/Videographer: everyone's favorite hipster and newly proud papa, Mr. Dan Turner 
Video Editors: Scott and Tony from Gro Productions (our editors are cooler than yours)
Inspiration provider/SayYesToTheUniverse Creator/Copy Editor: Scelena Richardson
Idea Sparker: My brillant, tough little cookie student who shall remain anonymous. You know who you are :) 
Our amazing/spectacular/bouncing ray of sunshine intern: Katie Philipson 
And a very special THANK YOU and shout out to Joe Herrera...our jack-of-all-trades - graphic designer, videographer, photographer, Nick's burrito provider, model, and most importantly, #1 supporter. This guy has spent countless hours putting UHDLT even before himself. Thank. You. So. Much.    





Q. I’m an Indiegogo novice. How does this work?
A. So, basically, we post our project on Indiegogo’s site, set a funding
goal and tell you all about it. If you’re into it, you donate/pre-order our
product. After 45 days, when the campaign ends, we get to work! As soon as we
hit our funding goal, we will complete our first production run and be on our
way to becoming a successful socially conscious business working toward
education equality! Don’t worry, even if we don’t hit our goal, we will be
making enough cases to fulfill our contributor’s orders. But let’s be honest…
these cases and our cause are amazing and we are determined to make this dream
a reality!
Q. How do I follow UHDLT’s progress?
A. When you contribute to our campaign, you become part of our project! We will keep you updated on our progress through our mailing list and you can
email us directly with any questions or comments. You can also follow us on
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter @uhdlt. A little inside scoop for ya…we’ll be
hosting Facebook contests to win a few free cases, so be sure to like our page at
https://www.facebook.com/UHDLT.
Q. Can I just donate?
A. Sure! Don’t have a laptop or tablet, but you believe in our mission
and want to help us reach our goal? Hit the ""Contribute
Now"" button on our page and donate however much you’d like. We really
appreciate your support! 
Q. Can I buy an UHDLT case as a gift? 
A. Of course! If you want us to ship a case as a gift just make sure you
include the giftee’s information as the shipping address. Also, we know the
holidays are quickly approaching and you may want to give an UHDLT case as a holiday gift, but they might not be ready in time. Not to fear. Let us know if your
pre-order is a gift and we will email you a little something-something that you
can either print out and wrap or send via email. 
Q. Alright, my case is pre-ordered. Now what are some other ways I can
help?  
A. We're so glad you asked! We would love for you to make some noise
about our project to your friends. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to
share, tweet, post, and blog your little hearts out. It could even be a great
conversation starter for that cute boy or girl in class or at work you’ve been
meaning to talk to. Yep, you’re welcome. But seriously, you spreading the word
about our cases and our cause would mean the world to us!
Q. How long will it take to receive my case? I want it now! 
A. Whoa, Veruca Salt. We are going to do our darndest to get these cases
to you as soon as possible, but we are a small company just starting out, so
your patience is GREATLY appreciated. Just so you have an idea, this is what
our production timeline looks like…


It will take roughly 3 weeks once production begins to complete and ship 250 cases, so if you are within the first 1,000 contributors to order you can expect to receive your case sometime between February and March. 
We will do everything in our power to expedite this process. 

Q. And shipping?
Note that we included the $5 domestic shipping cost in the REWARD price to make it
easier. 
Domestic shipping – $5 if shipping anywhere within the United States. 
If shipping internationally – $10 to Canada, $15 Worldwide. 
*So please ADD $5 for Canada and please ADD $10 Worldwide. 
Q. What
if I just can’t decide which one I want? 
A. Perfectly
normal. We understand your dilemma. Lucky for you there is no limit to how many
cases you can order and with six unique designs you can show off a different one
almost every day of the week!
Q. Are you going to make more prints?
A. That’s the idea! We want to keep our cases fresh and
unique, so when our current stock of prints run out, we will be launching a
whole new line. Let me re-iterate that. When we run out of a print, we’re out. You
might want to go order your favorite NOW before it’s too late. 
Q. How should I care for my case?
A. UHDLT cases can be easily spot-cleaned with soap and a moist towel. 
Q. How do I choose my size and style?
A. The REWARDS section is divided
by each style and size. So if you really want The Havana and you own a 13”
laptop, look for the reward box titled The Havana 13” Case. It’s that simple. 
Q. How
do I know my case will fit my tablet/laptop?
A. This
is pretty important. Our cases were designed to fit iPads, 13” MacBook Pros and
15” MacBook Pros comfortably. If you own any of those products, you’re good to go. But even if you aren’t an Apple-ite, we may still have something for you. Just check the
dimensions below and please make sure your device will fit WELL WITHIN the dimensions of our cases. 







Q.
Change of heart? 
A. If
you happen to order the wrong size or you accidentally click the wrong
style, we will exchange your case for another size or style. Just email us, info@uhdlt.com. 
Q. Still have an unanswered question?
A. Shoot us an email, info@uhdlt.com.
We will get back to you as soon as possible.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Strokes Maker</b> is a unique software product intended for

The software uses original algorithms for calculation of vector strokes based

strokes interrupt and intersect under different angles, turn from continuous to
dotted line, disappear and emerge again, changing their path and forming a
unique of a kind high quality vector image. One incorrectly calculated stroke,
like one false note in a symphony, can spoil the harmony of lines making up a
single image. But the Strokes Maker is tool of exclusively fine tuning,

Deliver WOW through customer experience 
The trilogy risks in managing a project are Delay – Cost – Quality. As certified project managers, we have taken several counter-measures to respect our delivery timeline.

Embrace and Deliver Change through Innovation

</h3><div>
<p>Many musicians think the audible click of a metronome takes the passion out of music - we agree! The click might even make you sound robotic<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. The vibration of the Soundbrenner Pulse guides you more naturally, as if someone would tap you on your shoulder.</span></p>
<p>It makes sense, if you think about it: Making music, we often tap our foot or move our body a bit. The feeling of the vibration integrates in that body feeling. That’s why you don’t need to focus so much as you would have to with an audible click. Focus on your music instead.</p>

<h3>Master the most difficult part of your songs!</h3>
<p>Practicing with a metronome is extremely useful for learning to accurately play rapid passages, to make sure you are neither rushing or dragging the tempo and to simply keep you honest to yourself until you've got the tempo 100% right. </p>
<p>Our iOS and Android app was designed to be the powerful tool that can help you to master all of this!</p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Does it actually work to follow the rhythm with vibrations?</b></span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Vibrations dont equal vibrations. While it is very difficult to pick up the rhythm through the vibrations of a smartwatch or smartphone we have developed a vibration that offers the necessary amplitude and accuracy to be a great tool to pick up the beat.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Has this been tested with musicians?</b></span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes. We have been talking to a lot of musicians from day one. Many of the features you've seen are a result from the deep understanding of the musicians needs we got during product testing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><b>How long will the battery last?</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span>The battery will approximately last 4-5 hours. If you practice with the device 30 minutes per day this will give you at least 1 week worth of battery life.</span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Do I need a smartphone to use the Soundbrenner Pulse?</b></span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>No. The device can be turned on/off directly on the device. The rhythm can be adjusted with the BPM Wheel and the BPM Tap. However, for more in depth functionality a smartphone is necessary.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><b>Does the device work with both iOS and Android phones?</b></span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Yes. We will offer a iOS and Android App from day one.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Is it waterproof?</b></span><br/></span></p>
<p>The device was designed to be sweat proof but it shouldn't be submerged in water.</p>
<p><b>I live outside of the United States, can I pre-order a Soundbrenner Pulse?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Soundbrenner Pulse will ship worldwide in November. For US residents shipping is free. For people living outside of the US please add $20 for shipping.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>Does the Soundbrenner Pulse come in my size?</b></span></p>
<p>Yes. The device comes with two different sized bands in which it can be inserted. We designed the bands to be suitable for everyone: Children, men and women.</p>
<p><b>How do I contact someone of the Soundbrenner team?</b></p>

<p><span><b>Are you really the world’s first wearable device for musicians?</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span>Technically even a guitar is a ""wearable device"" for musicians. However, what is commonly known as a wearable device today is a connected piece of electronics with communication and data input technologies.

<p><b>How does MIDI Sync work?</b></p>
<p><span>The MIDI sync works via a Soundbrenner desktop application for Mac and Windows, which would show up in any DAW as a MIDI device. If you choose to send a MIDI Clock signal to the app, it will be used to trigger vibrations on the device.<br/>Latency will be compensated within the software, so that the synchronization is seamless. Your computer has to be Bluetooth Smart compatible (most modern notebooks and computers offer this functionality.

An accurate inner sense of rhythm is one of the most important characteristics of a skilled musician! Everyone from our music teachers to world class players tell us to use a metronome if we want to become a great musician.But regular metronomes are annoying to use, take the passion out of making music and haven't improved in 200 years! That’s why we created the metronome of the 21st century: The Soundbrenner Pulse. It's packed with so many awesome features that you'll look for excuses to use it more often!




""Think of how many times you've missed a call because you didn't feel your phone's wimpy vibrations. The vibrating mechanism in the Soundbrenner Pulse is six times stronger than your smartphone's.""
Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo







""Unlike the vibration of a smart phone, the Pulse’s vibration is strong and well defined, with precise beginning and end points.""
Christopher Scapelliti, Guitar Player Magazine



      




       





       


     

      



Finally a metronome that you will actually love using!

Many musicians think the audible click of a metronome takes the passion out of music - we agree! The click might even make you sound robotic. The vibration of the Soundbrenner Pulse guides you more naturally, as if someone would tap you on your shoulder.
It makes sense, if you think about it: Making music, we often tap our foot or move our body a bit. The feeling of the vibration integrates in that body feeling. That’s why you don’t need to focus so much as you would have to with an audible click. Focus on your music instead.





Apple Watch vs. Soundbrenner Pulse

Master the most difficult part of your songs!
Practicing with a metronome is extremely useful for learning to accurately play rapid passages, to make sure you are neither rushing or dragging the tempo and to simply keep you honest to yourself until you've got the tempo 100% right. 
Our iOS and Android app was designed to be the powerful tool that can help you to master all of this!







Develop a rock-solid inner sense of rhythm!
You don't practice with a metronome to sound like a mechanical robot. You practice with it because you want to develop an inner pulse that stays with you forever. Once you have mastered playing on a stable rhythm you can then later choose to add certain nuances and more feel to your music as well!Tempo maps & MIDI SyncFor those who don't always play to the same BPM or time signature throughout a song, we added the possibility to create tempo maps. Set up the different time signatures and rhythm patterns for each sections of your songs in the mobile app and save them into set lists for easy access!And if you already use a click track in a music production software, we thought about you too...Create the click track straight in your favorite DAW and synchronize it via MIDI with the vibrations of the Soundbrenner Pulse. (Compatible with Ableton Live, Avid Pro Tools, Logic Pro X, and more! Macs only)
... and many more!Now you can use the Soundbrenner Pulse for audio recordings, live performances, professional music production, to help you compose your own songs and much more!Synchronize your band!With ""Multi-Link"" simply connect all Soundbrenner Pulse in the room to the same Android or iOS phone. This smartphone serves as the hub for control and can set the tempo and the rhythm pattern for up to 10 connected Soundbrenner Pulse! Every device will vibrate in perfect synchronization.

Change the Tempo right on your device!
With BPM Tap and the BPM Wheel you can change the tempo in seconds without taking the smartphone out of your pocket.












How to change the tempo







You will be able to wear the device literally ANYWHERE!
And today the Soundbrenner Pulse already comes with these bands:


Worn Everywhere

Each Soundbrenner Pulse comes with two bands. The short band is designed for the wrist and can also be worn by children, the long band is designed for the upper arm and the leg. Depending on your instrument and preference you can try out at home which location you prefer and comfortably switch out the bands.

Why don't you just make an app for a smartwatch?
Better than words, here's the reason why: https://youtu.be/HPw8oE61a1w
Does it actually work to follow the rhythm with vibrations?
Vibrations dont equal vibrations. While it is very difficult to pick up the rhythm through the vibrations of a smartwatch or smartphone we have developed a vibration that offers the necessary amplitude and accuracy to be a great tool to pick up the beat.
Has this been tested with musicians?
Yes. We have been talking to a lot of musicians from day one. Many of the features you've seen are a result from the deep understanding of the musicians needs we got during product testing.
How long will the battery last?
The battery will approximately last 4-5 hours. If you practice with the device 30 minutes per day this will give you at least 1 week worth of battery life.
Do I need a smartphone to use the Soundbrenner Pulse?
No. The device can be turned on/off directly on the device. The rhythm can be adjusted with the BPM Wheel and the BPM Tap. However, for more in depth functionality a smartphone is necessary.
Does the device work with both iOS and Android phones?
Yes. We will offer a iOS and Android App from day one.
Is it waterproof?
The device was designed to be sweat proof but it shouldn't be submerged in water.
I live outside of the United States, can I pre-order a Soundbrenner Pulse?
Yes. Soundbrenner Pulse will ship worldwide in November. For US residents shipping is free. For people living outside of the US please add $20 for shipping.

Does the Soundbrenner Pulse come in my size?
Yes. The device comes with two different sized bands in which it can be inserted. We designed the bands to be suitable for everyone: Children, men and women.
How do I contact someone of the Soundbrenner team?
Please visit our Contact Page on our website www.soundbrenner.com
Are you really the world’s first wearable device for musicians?
Technically even a guitar is a ""wearable device"" for musicians. However, what is commonly known as a wearable device today is a connected piece of electronics with communication and data input technologies. For more information see: http://www.wearabledevices.com/what-is-a-wearable-device/

How does MIDI Sync work?
The MIDI sync works via a Soundbrenner desktop application for Mac and Windows, which would show up in any DAW as a MIDI device. If you choose to send a MIDI Clock signal to the app, it will be used to trigger vibrations on the device.Latency will be compensated within the software, so that the synchronization is seamless. Your computer has to be Bluetooth Smart compatible (most modern notebooks and computers offer this functionality. Alternatively buy an inexpensive USB dongle to receive Bluetooth Smart compatibility)",66.0,5,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong><em>What the heck is Sandies Dandies?</em></strong></p>
<p>Sandies Dandies is a fan club that will be made up of people that are willing to help Jake Sanders financially as he seeks to begin his career as a professional golfer and evaluate his true potential for playing golf at the highest level. </p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Who is Jake Sanders?</em></strong></p>
<p>Jake Sanders, age 24, is seeking to begin the journey that all aspiring young golfers dream of.  That dream is to play golf for a living and achieve golfing success at the highest level, the PGA Tour.  The first order of business to make that dream a reality is to START. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Jake is a humble small town kid from Crookston, Minnesota – a town of approximately 8,000 people located in the Northwest corner of the state.  I have been impressed with Jake from the first time I had the chance to compete against him.  I’ve had the opportunity to watch him grow not just as a golfer, but as a true player.  He has all the tools.  His mechanics are sound, he hits it a mile, all facets of his game are strong, and he has a terrific demeanor on the course.  I believe the sky is the limit for Jake”.  </em></p>
<p align=""center"">-Scott Lindgren, former golf professional and Charter Member of Sandies Dandies</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Jake’s Golf Background</em></strong></p>
<p>Jake is a 4-time Minnesota Class A State Tournament participant, with All State honors from 2005-2007.  He was either MVP or Co-MVP of his high school team as a Sophomore, Junior and Senior.  As a Senior at the University of Minnesota, Crookston, Jake was a member of the NSIC All Conference Team as well as the Ping All Region Team.  His career low score is 61 (-11) and he holds several records from his time at UMC.  His game has continued to improve since the end of his collegiate golf career with wins in both stroke play and match play formats at local competitions.  It’s time to help Jake test the waters at a higher level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>In 2013</em></strong></p>
<p>We are looking for new members of Sandies Dandies!  The goal in 2013 is to raise $20,000, enough financial support to allow Jake to participate on the Dakotas Tour.  The Dakotas Tour schedule is made up of 16 events conducted in the months of June, July and August.  The money raised would provide for entry fees, hotel, food and fuel.  It will also allow Jake to work with a Swing Coach on a regular basis.  Winnings from 2013 Dakotas Tour events will go towards entry fee and travel costs for future events and hopefully one day, a trip to Q School.  There is no guarantee of success and Jake is well aware of that, but he is a young man worthy of being given a chance and he could use our help.  Join us as a Dandy today!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>The Role of A Dandy</em></strong></p>
<p>The role of A Dandy is to provide whatever financial support they can to give Jake a chance to pursue his dream.  A Dandy will dress as a Dandy while on the golf course (Dandies clothing will be available on the Sandies Dandies website beginning June 2013) whenever possible.  A Dandy will promote Sandies Dandies to his/her golfing buddies and recruit others to become members.  A Dandy will follow Jake’s progress on the Sandies Dandies website and Facebook.  A Dandy doesn’t look for anything in return for their contribution.  You get the satisfaction of helping a deserving young man pursue his dream!</p>

<p><strong>Our 15 Day Campaign Explained</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign will only be for 15 days, as this will let you have QR-Cubes in time for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>2D to 3D... and Beyond!</strong></p>
<p>Our QR-Cubes have unique encrypted QR codes etched into the cube sides. These special codes access the 'Cube Matrix', where they are decrypted, identified, and the browser that scanned it redirects to wherever you, the QR-Cube's owner, have decided to send your visitor. This takes you beyond the 3D cube and into a whole new dimension of possibilities.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Present"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cube.qr-cube.com/images/ThePresentMD.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Present""/><br/><br/><strong>Get Creative</strong></p>
<p>The QR-Cube can be programmed with your favorite links and sit on your desk as a sort of Vanity Cube, but since each side of the QR-Cube can be programmed as often as you like, why stop there?</p>
<p>As a Gift Cube, program it to whatever websites your partner loves.</p>
<p>As an Event Cube, It can start out as an announcement, then an invitation, then through the steps until the event is done, then it can become a ink to a photo gallery as a memento to the event.</p>
<p>As a Business Cube it can be programmed to deliver incentives, special offers or deals.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is using a QR-Cube as a wedding cube... It's an announcement, then an invitation, then a link to gift registries, maps of the ceremony, menu at the reception, follow up with personal Thanks Yous, Gallery Links and... well, you get the idea. It's a memento that can change with the times. Then, when it's all done it can remain with your guests as a gallery and keepsake.</p>
<p>Or how about programming a QR-Cube as a 'clue sheet' for corporate scavenger-hunt or team-building exercises?</p>
<p>Here are few more ideas, but your imagination is your only limit!</p>

<p>We’re here on Indiegogo first because we're ready to set up dedicated production to get your QR-Cube delivered as soon as possible. We need a dedicated Laser Engraver to do that.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to move the Cube Matrix to a more robust and expandable Cloud-based platform. This will ensure quick responses on your QR-Cube scans.</p>
<p>We take these last crucial steps seriously, and we’ll need a lot of support to do the job right. That’s why we’ve turned to Indiegogo to get QR-Cubes up and running!</p>

<p><strong>Holiday QR-Cubes</strong></p>
<p>We've been able to arrange to deliver a select number of QR-Cubes almost immediately after our Indiegogo campaign ends. So we have doubled up the perks to allocate a small quantity for special pre-holiday shipping. So pick the right shipping; this will ensure your QR-Cube gift can get to where it needs to be in time for the holidays.</p>

<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Similar to many Indiegogo projects, we face several key risks and challenges in sparking the QR-Cube revolution. The primary risks for us include:</p>
<p><em>ENGINEERING</em></p>
<p>To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we have to design and engineer a very complex distributed system. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success. 1) We have formed an amazing team of engineers and designers, and 2) we test our systems with a passion for perfection. In the last year, we have built 3 generations of code generators, 2 generations of production layup tools and created a working version of the Cube Matrix. We have a beta run of the Cube Matrix with significant user testing, and we keep enormous amounts of data to guide our future work.</p>
<p><em>SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS</em></p>
<p>Many Indiegogo campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues finding suppliers and engineering machines for high production volumes. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks. We take this lesson seriously and have been working for months negotiating with suppliers, testing machine quality, and building a team that can execute on our promises. Our plans are fully in place, and we now mainly require the resources to execute them.</p>
<p><em>TEAM</em></p>
<p>Finding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Success in our venture requires a team of talented, passionate, and motivated designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. We have already formed a truly awesome (and fun!) team, but we will have to bring in more Cubelings to realize this dream. In fact, we are actively looking for new members to join us and hit the ground running! Check out our website for more information.</p>

Holiday QR-Cubes
We've been able to arrange to deliver a select number of QR-Cubes almost immediately after our Indiegogo campaign ends. So we have doubled up the perks to allocate a small quantity for special pre-holiday shipping. So pick the right shipping; this will ensure your QR-Cube gift can get to where it needs to be in time for the holidays.
Santa Cubes!
On the other hand, If you can wait a bit longer to get your cube, it will be just a bit cheaper for you.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Similar to many Indiegogo projects, we face several key risks and challenges in sparking the QR-Cube revolution. The primary risks for us include:
ENGINEERING
To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we have to design and engineer a very complex distributed system. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success. 1) We have formed an amazing team of engineers and designers, and 2) we test our systems with a passion for perfection. In the last year, we have built 3 generations of code generators, 2 generations of production layup tools and created a working version of the Cube Matrix. We have a beta run of the Cube Matrix with significant user testing, and we keep enormous amounts of data to guide our future work.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS
Many Indiegogo campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues finding suppliers and engineering machines for high production volumes. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks. We take this lesson seriously and have been working for months negotiating with suppliers, testing machine quality, and building a team that can execute on our promises. Our plans are fully in place, and we now mainly require the resources to execute them.
TEAM
Finding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Success in our venture requires a team of talented, passionate, and motivated designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. We have already formed a truly awesome (and fun!) team, but we will have to bring in more Cubelings to realize this dream. In fact, we are actively looking for new members to join us and hit the ground running! Check out our website for more information.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Having a presence at Graduate Fashion Week means you can present your work on a national level and can lead to winning prestigious awards and funding.</p>

So far we have held bake sales, fabric sales, help swap shops to raise money however we are still short of reaching our goal. We are hoping to raise £500 from this campaign, which will go a long way to help us reach Graduate Fashion Week with a bang...</p>
<p>There are lots of costs involved with showcasing our work in a professional manner at Graduate Fashion Week. We need to raise funding to help cover the following costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to hire fit models to ensure our garments fit perfectly.</li>
<li>We need to oraganise a photoshoot for brochure images; this entails hiring a photographer, studio, models, make up artists.</li>
<li>We need to produce a brochure/lookbook where a look from each student’s collection will be presented; this involves retouching of images, designing a layout and printing costs.</li>
<li>Alongside the show we also have a presence on a stand at GFW. To attract the maximum amount of attention to our stand we have to make sure it looks slick, professional and eye-catching. The more money we raise, the more fantastic our stand will look and our work will receive all the more attention from all the right people.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Making a strong presence at Graduate Fashion Week will be a fantastic way to honour four years of extremely hard work and a great jumpstart to our careers. Any help you can give us will make a tremendous difference and we would be so grateful for any donations. </p>
<p>Your contributions will be completely anonymous and you can donate as much, or as little as you wish.</p>

Thank you for your

                        What is
SAVEREFRIGERATOR?
SAVEREFRIGERATOR is a simple and low-cost effective idea
that will bring you significant energy and economic savings in your home.
The system is based on a very simple idea: install a
transparent door on each refrigerator shelf so when we open the door
of the refrigerator to put in or take out something we retain most of the cold air
and temperature and consequently when we reclose the door the refrigerator does
not need to consume a great deal of energy to reattain the previous programmed internal
temperature.

Study Results
Consumption without SAVEREFRIGERATOR system  
1´1724 KW/h  per day.

Consumption with SAVEREFRIGERATOR system    0´8535 KW/h per day




Study made with a refrigerator
rated A+                                            

                                                     Save money
                                                                                       …and Nature thanks you!According to our
study, with this system over a nine month period the energy consumption of the refrigerator
decreased by 27.2%.



With this system we
save money and energy, 
We also avoid unpleasant odours. 

Our food is better preserved, 

We ensure a longer life cycle of the
refrigerator and 

We help to preserve and protect the environment.



Don´t wait to save money and energy. The energy saving
is something very important for each one of us, and benefits all of us.  







                                        
                                              

My name is Ruben Istúriz. I live in Mutilva, a Spanish Village in Navarra. I´m 42 years old,
married and the father of five children. I’ve been an entrepreneur since I was a teenager. Today
I would like to present my newest idea, the SAVEREFRIGERATOR in order to expand
it globally.
The idea came from watching a programme where two
technicians explained how important the correct use of the refrigerator was, due
to its high energy consumption.
They were explaining that before opening the refrigerator
we should think what we want to take out. Think about its concrete location
inside, in order to take it out and close the door as quickly as possible in
order to decrease the time with the door opened and thereby minimizing the
energy lost.Which 
is the cheapest electricity?

What is the best electricity for you?
What is the best electricity for the 
Environment?
it is the electricity THAT YOU DO NOT CONSUME. 
Non-generated electricity is the best electricity for you and the 
planet. 
After checking the
benefits for myself with an initial test I decided to start this Project. We save some money and we reduce
CO2, NO2 and SO2 emissions into the atmosphere.
The system is fully
recyclable and reusable as it can be removed from one refrigerator and
installed in another one.
                                                                             
At this stage we have
used all our own financial resources and we cannot expend any more due to our
large family, five children and two adults.  


The next step will
be to conduct tests in an independent laboratory with a view to homologation, but
for this and other expenses we need an additional investment of  143.039 USD
               
        
Budget 1/ CertificationThe
first priority is to certify the exact savings of this system. The

Whether you are supporting this Project or not, we
appreciate your time and proactivity. This already makes you a great person and
this will eventually lead to a better world.
            
     Let´s make it happen



Proactivity: An
attitude in which the subject assumes control of their conduct in active mode,
which involves the taking of initiative in the development of the creative
actions to generate improvements, by asserting the freedom of choice about the
circumstances of the context. Proactivity means not only taking the initiative,
but in assuming that things happen; deciding in each moment what we want to do
and how we are going to do it. You have come to
realize the strength and beauty of this definition. Impressive.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>CHALLENGE: <br/>The challenges of the SUNO WALLET on Indiegogo will be getting the word out, and convincing backers to participate. There are so many amazing projects out there, it is going to be hard to get the attention we need to make this wallet successful. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help us spread the word.</p>
<p>Once the funding is in place, our challenge will be producing a very large quantity of wallets, and making sure all the partners I'm working with maintain our quality standards. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with the companies we are working with for years and establishing a solid communication base that has given us a lot of confidence in them.</p>

BEHIND THE CURTAIN

Risks and challenges
CHALLENGE: The challenges of the SUNO WALLET on Indiegogo will be getting the word out, and convincing backers to participate. There are so many amazing projects out there, it is going to be hard to get the attention we need to make this wallet successful. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help us spread the word.
Once the funding is in place, our challenge will be producing a very large quantity of wallets, and making sure all the partners I'm working with maintain our quality standards. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with the companies we are working with for years and establishing a solid communication base that has given us a lot of confidence in them.",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Translating a book is nearly as expensive as writing one, and we are working with professional translating companies who are experienced in French to English translations. Each book has around 300 pages, so you can imagine the amount of work this entails. The biggest expense is the printing. The demand for books is bigger in English than in French, so we had to triple the copies printed for each book. And as our books are high-quality, well-protected and have detailed covers, not every printer could meet our expectations. So, of course, expenses went up too. But we wanted to have a printer in the US, so we can show that our commitment goes further than this campaign and really set foot in this market – and we found one! Also, even if we already have a logistics center for our French distribution, we can’t just send book overseas, it’s way too pricey for the reader and takes too long. That’s why we had to find someone to work with who was already located in the US. It’s better when it’s closer! </p>

<p>As soon as we reach the funding goal, we will submit the French texts to the translation company. It should take around two months to translate, as a lot of people will handle the manuscript simultaneously. Then, we will send it all to the printer, who will give it a final check, and then print. 5 weeks later, the books will be ready to ship! As we are shipping from the US, you can expect to receive them in under a week.<br/><br/>So, with an optimistic schedule, all that should take less than 4 months. But we prefer to stay cautious, and have a margin of error so as not to make false promises. That's why we prefer to announce 5 months to have the final result to each and every one of our backers.</p>

Some of them weren’t mainstream enough to be translated, but the vast majority could interest international readers. For now, the campaign is only focused on our 5 best-sellers: Dark Souls, Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid, Zelda and BioShock.

 

As soon as we reach the funding goal, we will submit the French texts to the translation company. It should take around two months to translate, as a lot of people will handle the manuscript simultaneously. Then, we will send it all to the printer, who will give it a final check, and then print. 5 weeks later, the books will be ready to ship! As we are shipping from the US, you can expect to receive them in under a week.So, with an optimistic schedule, all that should take less than 4 months. But we prefer to stay cautious, and have a margin of error so as not to make false promises. That's why we prefer to announce 5 months to have the final result to each and every one of our backers.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducing: the feelSpace navigation belt! <br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The feelSpace navigation belt is your new friend for adventure, travel, biking, hiking, sailing or just plain getting where you want - just follow your gut feeling! <br/>
Navigation and orientation doesn't have to be difficult- and doesn't require constantly checking the direction on your smartphone. Instead, why don't you enjoy the beautiful landscape, the impressive architecture or an inspiring conversation? And still arrive at your destination - <b>safely, relaxed, effortless</b>.<br/>
And the best thing about it? The navigation belt is <b>so easy and intuitive </b> to use, absolutely <b>everyone can use it!</b><br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Features<br/><br/>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Do you enjoy biking or motorcycling? </b>We all know it's better to keep the hands on the handlebar and the eyes on the street. The navigation belt lets you do just that. Enjoy your ride and arrive safely!</p>
<p><img alt=""picture: Leave old pathes. Explore and discover new terrain."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462964241/UseCase_Tourists_oe6k4z.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Isn't it fun to explore new cities and landscapes? </b>What a shame if you have to worry about getting lost in those scenic but mazelike little alleys! Ever gone a bit astray in the forest where one tree looks like the other? Or cursed the beautiful sunlight because your smartphone display is virtually impossible to read? And then that parking meter is running somewhere or the train is leaving soon (if only you knew how to get there...!). Forget about all of these worries- explore, discover, enjoy. Relaxed and stress-free, just as those special places deserve to be experienced! <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b></b></p><p><img alt=""picture: Invible underneath your clothes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463911130/UseCase_Invisble_qgxsh7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Want to walk through Shanghai and pretend like you are a local? </b>Well, if you keep staring at that smartphone display and nervously try to read street signs (added difficulty in Shanghai: some sings are in Chinese only...!), about anyone will know that you don't know where you are. With the navigation belt? No problem. Just wear it underneath your clothes, it's thin and comfortable- no one will even suspect that you are being navigated! <br/></p>
<p><img alt=""picture: A new sense of orientation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463052146/UseCase_Blind_kkrzfo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Do you suffer from a visual impairment, low sense of orientation or any other condition that makes navigation a hassle? </b>Please don't stay home just because ""getting there"" seems so difficult. The feelSpace navigation belt will guide you from A to B while your hands, eyes and ears remain free to explore the environment or monitor the traffic. You will feel safe, independent and self-sufficient. The belt can give you the courage to re-discover your curiosity and interests. Wherever you go- you won't get lost. <br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Background<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Originally, feelSpace was a research project at the University of Osnabrück, Germany. We started over 10 years ago and used compass belts in order to investigate whether humans can learn a new navigation sense, like migrant birds possess it. Continuous vibrations around the waist indicate the direction towards magnetic north. Our study results show that tactile belts simplify navigation - and circumvent the bottleneck of attention. This is to say that while your eyes and ears are fully occupied with your surroundings, traffic, the landscape or a conversation, the tactile signal is still being processed by your brain. Surveys show that belt wearers feel safe and relaxed during navigation - they have the reassuring knowledge that they will never get lost. Some study participants even asked to keep the tactile belt after the study. This motivated us to bring the feelSpace belt from research to everyday life and to add further functionalities, like displaying the beeline towards a freely selectable destination.<br/><br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The belt development<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""> In the course of the past 10 years the belt has changed and evolved in its appearance. Since everyday life and research are quite different, we developed a belt version that it is smaller, lighter and more comfortable. In March 2016 we presented the current prototype at the CeBIT in Hannover.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""> The navigation belt is able to connect via bluetooth to a smartphone. Our feelSpace app computes the direction or route towards a specified destination and sends a signal to the belt. The belt itself contains a compass and thereby allows to provide directional information relative to your body alignment and movement. Presently, we work on the app for Android using OpenStreetMaps. <br/>
With the crowdfunding campaign we want to develop the belt into a product, finalize the hardware and get the necessary certifications done. <br/><br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>What is the feelSpace belt? </b><br/>
The feelSpace belt is a navigation device that lets you feel directions. It consists of electronics, power supply and a number of vibration units. We’ve designed it to be a comfortable fit around your waist for long hiking and biking tours. The inner lining is made from high-quality tech-fabric to avoid excessive sweating. The outer envelope is resistant to water, because we all know that in the outdoors, rain happens. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>What does the feelSpace belt do? </b><br/>
It vibrates! But not just arbitrarily- it signals towards a certain direction: Either the vibration signals magnetic north, letting you know where north is and giving you a new, never before experienced understanding of any environment (compass belt). Or it signals to a destination as the crow flies- for example your hotel, the parking lot where your car is waiting, or your home (navigation belt). Last but not least, it is planned that it guides you from A to B with Routing and turn-by-turn signals. No need to incessantly stare on that smartphone screen anymore! You will always know where to go- and never get lost again. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Do I need a smartphone to operate the belt? </b><br/>
The feelSpace compass belt works without Smartphone and is fully functional as a stand-alone device. Using the integrated buttons you can change for instance the vibration intensity. The vibromotor indicating north is active.
The feelSpace navigation belt can display north without using a smartphone, but if you want to use the beeline function or routing function, the smartphone is needed to calculate the directions.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>How much does it cost?</b><br/></p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">
Through this campaign you receive the belts for a reduced price. If you order  them through our website (feelSpace.de), a “pure” compass belt will be 749
Euro and the navigation version will be 799 Euro. Here you get a better offer because the prices are in dollar. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>What do I get if I order the compass belt perk?</b><br/>
If you choose the compass belt, you receive a feelSpace belt with compass
functionality plus the instructions. You put the belt on, turn it on by using the integrated buttons and from that moment onwards you continuously know where north is- no matter where you go. This is cool if you already have pretty good orientation and want to make your understanding of spatial relations and localization even better. In scientific studies, we have shown that people who continuously practise with the compass belt for about six weeks start to feel the space around them in a never before experienced manner. Some even say it feels like a new sense! The compass belt works independently of a smartphone. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>What do I get if I order the navigation belt perk?</b><br/>
You get the feelSpace navigation belt and the feelSpace beeline-app that comes with it (first for Android). The belt has all the advantages of the compass belt, i.e. it can indicate north independently of a smartphone app – but on top of that, it also connects wirelessly to your smartphone. Thus, you don’t only know where north is – you can let the belt signal any address or GPS coordinate you are interested in. If we make it to our stretch goal of $50.000, you can get the
package for iPhone. And if we make it to $100.000, we will be able to provide
the full-blown barrier-free navigation app with turn-by-turn navigation functionality! If we don't reach that high goal, it will take us longer but eventually we get there.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>In which sizes can I get the feelSpace belt?</b><br/>
The standard sizes cover circumferences of 72 cm (28 inch) to 136 cm (53 inch). Are
you larger or smaller than that? Just pick the tailor-made version perk and we
are glad to carter to all your needs. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>How much does the belt weigh? </b><br/>
The belt is designed to be very light. The weight is about 450 gr (about 1 pound). <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Can the feelSpace belt replace
traditional aids for impaired persons?</b><br/>
The feelSpace belt cannot replace the traditional white cane for blind people. The white cane is important to detect obstacles on the way such as barriers, holes or the curb. The feelSpace belt additionally provides an overview of where to go and how to get there, so it is a great addition to the white cane! <br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><b><u>Technical questions:</u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>What smartphone do I need for the feelSpace belt?</b><br/>
If you only want compass functionality, you don’t need a smartphone at all. But if you want GPS functionality, it really depends on the funding we are able to get- if you order a naviBelt, you will definitely receive a beeline App for Android 4.0.3
or higher. But if we reach our stretch goals, we will be able to provide an app for
Android and iOS with full navigation turn-by-turn functionality! <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Do I get a technical instruction after receiving the product?</b><br/>
Sure. The belt will come with an instruction manual. <br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><b><u>Shipping:</u></b></p>
<p><b>When can I get the feelSpace belt?</b><br/>
The belt ships in early December 2016. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Where does feelSpace ship to?</b><br/>
We are able to ship worldwide. Shipping is $5 in Germany; for shipping to another EU-country $15 are added to your order for shipping. Shipping to other countries in the world is $18. Please note that shipping to any country outside of the European Union may be delayed a bit due to necessary certifications, local product approval requirements or local import regulations. There may be additional duties, fees or taxes charged by the the authorities in your country which will be covered at your expense when receiving the shipment.<br/></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Unser Hintergrund<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">feelSpace war ursprünglich ein Forschungsprojekt der Universität Osnabrück. Vor über 10 Jahren starteten wir und verwendeten Kompassgürtel, um zu erforschen, ob der Mensch einen Sinn für Norden, wie ihn Zugvögel haben, erlernen kann. Dabei zeigte eine kontinuierliche Vibration rund um die Taille an, wo sich der magnetische Norden relativ zur eigenen Körperausrichtung befindet. Schnell wurde das Signal von unseren Studienteilnehmern nur noch unbewusst wahrgenommen und bereits nach wenigen Wochen waren sie mehr unterwegs, konnten sich besser orientieren und erlebten ihre Umgebung ganz neu. Das Sicherheitsgefühl stieg, da die Teilnehmer besser wussten, wo sie her kamen und hin wollten. Besonders Blinde haben in hohem Maße von den fühlbaren Richtungsanzeige profitiert, da sie für sie einen Ankerpunkt zum Orientieren darstellte.<br/>
Viele Teilnehmer wollten den Gürtel nach der Studie nicht zurückgeben und fragten nach einer Möglichkeit ihn zu erwerben. So wurden wir motiviert, aus dem Kompassgürtel für die Forschung eine Version für den Alltag zu machen und die Funktionen zu erweitern, sodass er auch beliebig wählbare Ziele anzeigen kann.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Die Gürtelentwicklung<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Im Laufe der letzten 10 Jahre hat sich der Gürtel in seiner Erscheinung gewandelt. Da sich der Forschungsalltag vom privaten Alltag stark unterscheidet, arbeiten wir daran Größe, Gewicht, Bequemlichkeit und Aussehen angenehmer zu gestalten. Im März 2016 konnten wir unseren neuen Prototyp auf der CeBIT präsentiert.</p>
<p><img alt=""Foto: Übersicht über die Gürtelgenerationen von 2005 bis 2016"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462966410/G%C3%BCrtelversionen_Jahreszahlen_wr57cu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Der naviGürtel entfaltet seine volle Funktionalität im Zusammenspiel mit der feelSpace App. Das Smartphone nimmt die Richtungs- und Wegberechnung vor und sendet Informationen über Bluetooth an den naviGürtel. Der naviGürtel enthält selbst einen Kompass und daher kann sich das Signal optimal relativ zur Körperausrichtung und -bewegung anpassen. Aktuell arbeiten wir an einer App für Android, welche OpenStreetMaps nutzt.<br/>
Mit dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne wollen wir den naviGürtel zur Produktionsreife fertig entwickeln und barrierefrei machen.<br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Was genau ist der feelSpace Gürtel? </b><br/>
Ganz einfach - der feelSpace Gürtel ist ein Navigationsgerät, das Richtungsinformationen fühlbar macht. Der Gürtel besteht aus
Steuerungselektronik, Batterie und 16 Vibrationsmotoren. Wir haben alles so
gestaltet, dass es angenehm zu tragen ist, auch wenn man stundenlang wandert,
Fahrrad fährt oder reist. Die Innenseite besteht aus hochwertigen Stoffen, so
dass man unter dem Gürtel nicht schwitzt. Die Außenhülle ist wasserabweisend,
um Regen oder Spritzwasser abzuhalten. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Was macht der feelSpace Gürtel? </b><br/>
Er vibriert! Aber nicht einfach irgendwie - sondern er zeigt eine Richtung
an. Der Kompassgürtel zeigt einem den magnetischen Norden. Mit ein bisschen Training vermittelt er ein ganz neues, nie zuvor erlebtes Raumgefühl. Der naviGürtel kann zusätzlich die Luftlinie zu einer Adresse oder GPS Koordinate anzeigen, zum Beispiel zum Hotel, zum Parkplatz oder nach Hause. Geplant ist, dass der naviGürtel auch Routing und turn-by-turn Routen anzeigen kann - so dass man unterwegs nicht dauernd auf das Smartphone schauen muss. Man weiß einfach immer, wo es lang geht - und kommt fühlbar sicher an. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Kann ich den Gürtel auch ohne Smartphone nutzen? </b><br/>
Der feelSpace Kompassgürtel funktioniert komplett ohne Smartphone. Über eingebaute Knöpfe kann man Einstellungen direkt am Gürtel vornehmen, z.B. Intensität der Vibration. Es vibirert immer derjenige Vibromotor, der nach Norden weist.<br/>
Der feelSpace naviGürtel kann neben der Smartphone unabhängigen Kompassfunktion auch mit einem Smartphone kommunizieren. Wir entwicklen derzeit die feelSpace App: nach Eingabe eines Ziels führt das Smartphone die Richtungsberechnung durch. Der Gürtel kann dann die Luftlinie zum Ziel und Weginformation ausgeben.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Was kostet der feelSpace Gürtel? </b><br/>Hier über die Kampagne erhältst du eine Preisreduktion auf die Gürtel. Wenn du den Gürtel über unsere Website kaufst, kostet ein Kompassgürtel später 749
Euro und ein NaviGürtel 799 Euro. Hier bekommst du ihn günstiger, denn hier sind alle Preise in Dollar angegeben! </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Was bekomme ich, wenn ich mich für einen Kompassgürtel-Perk entscheide? </b><br/>
Wer einen Kompassgürtel bestellt, erhält den feelSapce Gürtel mit
Kompassfunktionalität plus eine dazugehörige Gebrauchsanweisung. Man zieht den Gürtel an, schaltet ihn über integrierte Knöpfe an und von da an weiß man immer genau, wo Norden ist - egal, wo man hingeht. Das ist vor allem dann eine coole Sache, wenn man schon ein gutes Orientierungsvermögen mitbringt und sich noch weiter steigern will. In wissenschaftlichen Studien haben wir nachgewiesen, dass Leute, die über mehrere Wochen mit dem Gürtel trainieren, ein völlig neues Raumgefühl erleben. Manche sagen sogar, dass es sich wie ein völlig neuer Sinn anfühlt! </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Was bekomme ich, wenn ich einen naviGürtel-Perk
bestelle? </b><br/>
Du bekommst den feelSpace naviGürtel und die dazugehörige feelSpace Luftlinien-App (zunächst für Android). Dabei kann die Kompassfunktion des naviGürtels ohne Smartphone verwendet werden. Mit der feelSpace Luftlinien App ist darüber hinaus die Luftlinienfunktion nutzbar und du kannst dir die Richtung zu jeder beliebigen
Adresse oder GPS Koordinate anzeigen lassen. Wenn wir unser erweitertes Ziel von $50.000 erreichen, liefern wir die App auch für iPhone; und wenn wir sogar die $100.000 knacken, gibt es die barrierefreie Navigationsapp mit Routingfunktionalität dazu! Wenn wir diese Ziele nicht erreichen, wird die weitere Entwicklung mehr Zeit in Anspruch nehmen. Dem naviGürtel wird eine Gebrauchsanweisung beiliegen.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>In welchen Größen gibt es den feelSpace Gürtel? </b><br/>
Unsere Standardgrößen können einen Bauchumfang von 72 cm (28 inch) bis hin zu
136 cm (53 inch) abdecken. Brauchen Sie einen kleineren oder größeren
Gürtel? Dann einfach den „maßgeschneidert“ Perk auswählen, wir schneidern den
Gürtel dann individuell nach Ihren Bedürfnissen zu. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Was wiegt der Gürtel? </b><br/>
Der Gürtel ist super leicht und wiegt maximal 450 g. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Kann der Gürtel traditionelle Blindenhilfsmittel wie z.B. den Langstock ersetzen? </b><br/>
Nein, das kann und will der Gürtel nicht. Gerade der Langstock ist sehr
wichtig im Alltag, um Dellen im Boden, die Bordsteinkante oder Hindernisse auf
dem Weg zu erkennen. Der Gürtel dient dazu, Orte, die sich in einiger Distanz
befinden, fühlbar zu machen. Und natürlich den Weg dorthin zu zeigen! </p>
<hr/>
<p><b><u>Technische Fragen </u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Kann man jedes Smartphone mit dem Gürtel verbinden? </b><br/>
Wer einen Kompassgürtel möchte, braucht gar kein Smartphone, aber für GPS Funktionalität schon. Welche Betriebssysteme wir unterstützen können, hängt auch davon ab, wieviel Geld wir hier einnehmen. Was wir auf jeden Fall versprechen können, ist eine Luftlinie App, die mit Android 4.0.3 oder höher
kompatibel ist. Aber wenn wir mehr als unser Ziel erreichen, dann entwickeln
wir die App auch für iPhone zeitnah. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Bekomme ich eine
Gebrauchsanweisung mit dem Gürtel? </b><br/>
</p><p>Selbstverständlich! </p>
<hr/>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b><u>Versand</u></b><br/>
<b>Wann bekomme ich den Gürtel zugesendet, wenn ich ihn heute kaufe? </b>
Wir fangen im Dezember 2016 mit der Auslieferung an. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Wohin wird geliefert?</b><br/>
Wir liefern weltweit. Der Versand kostet $5, wenn der Gürtel
nach Deutschland verschickt werden soll, wenn er in andere EU-Länder verschickt werden soll, kostet es $15. Der Versand in andere Länder kostet $18. Bestellungen aus Ländern außerhalb der europäischen Union können eventuell etwas später geliefert
werden, je nach den Zertifizierungen und Produktregularien der Länder.
Möglicherweise kommen dann noch extra Kosten beim Abholen des Gürtels im
Zollamt dazu. Diese können wir leider nicht übernehmen. </p>

<p><b><u>Allgemeine Fragen </u></b></p>

Introducing: the feelSpace navigation belt! 

The feelSpace navigation belt is your new friend for adventure, travel, biking, hiking, sailing or just plain getting where you want - just follow your gut feeling! 
Navigation and orientation doesn't have to be difficult- and doesn't require constantly checking the direction on your smartphone. Instead, why don't you enjoy the beautiful landscape, the impressive architecture or an inspiring conversation? And still arrive at your destination - safely, relaxed, effortless.
And the best thing about it? The navigation belt is so easy and intuitive  to use, absolutely everyone can use it!
Features


Use Cases


Do you enjoy biking or motorcycling? We all know it's better to keep the hands on the handlebar and the eyes on the street. The navigation belt lets you do just that. Enjoy your ride and arrive safely!

Isn't it fun to explore new cities and landscapes? What a shame if you have to worry about getting lost in those scenic but mazelike little alleys! Ever gone a bit astray in the forest where one tree looks like the other? Or cursed the beautiful sunlight because your smartphone display is virtually impossible to read? And then that parking meter is running somewhere or the train is leaving soon (if only you knew how to get there...!). Forget about all of these worries- explore, discover, enjoy. Relaxed and stress-free, just as those special places deserve to be experienced! 

Want to walk through Shanghai and pretend like you are a local? Well, if you keep staring at that smartphone display and nervously try to read street signs (added difficulty in Shanghai: some sings are in Chinese only...!), about anyone will know that you don't know where you are. With the navigation belt? No problem. Just wear it underneath your clothes, it's thin and comfortable- no one will even suspect that you are being navigated! 

Do you suffer from a visual impairment, low sense of orientation or any other condition that makes navigation a hassle? Please don't stay home just because ""getting there"" seems so difficult. The feelSpace navigation belt will guide you from A to B while your hands, eyes and ears remain free to explore the environment or monitor the traffic. You will feel safe, independent and self-sufficient. The belt can give you the courage to re-discover your curiosity and interests. Wherever you go- you won't get lost. 
Our Background

Originally, feelSpace was a research project at the University of Osnabrück, Germany. We started over 10 years ago and used compass belts in order to investigate whether humans can learn a new navigation sense, like migrant birds possess it. Continuous vibrations around the waist indicate the direction towards magnetic north. Our study results show that tactile belts simplify navigation - and circumvent the bottleneck of attention. This is to say that while your eyes and ears are fully occupied with your surroundings, traffic, the landscape or a conversation, the tactile signal is still being processed by your brain. Surveys show that belt wearers feel safe and relaxed during navigation - they have the reassuring knowledge that they will never get lost. Some study participants even asked to keep the tactile belt after the study. This motivated us to bring the feelSpace belt from research to everyday life and to add further functionalities, like displaying the beeline towards a freely selectable destination. 
The belt development

 In the course of the past 10 years the belt has changed and evolved in its appearance. Since everyday life and research are quite different, we developed a belt version that it is smaller, lighter and more comfortable. In March 2016 we presented the current prototype at the CeBIT in Hannover.

 The navigation belt is able to connect via bluetooth to a smartphone. Our feelSpace app computes the direction or route towards a specified destination and sends a signal to the belt. The belt itself contains a compass and thereby allows to provide directional information relative to your body alignment and movement. Presently, we work on the app for Android using OpenStreetMaps. 
With the crowdfunding campaign we want to develop the belt into a product, finalize the hardware and get the necessary certifications done.

FAQ

What is the feelSpace belt? 
The feelSpace belt is a navigation device that lets you feel directions. It consists of electronics, power supply and a number of vibration units. We’ve designed it to be a comfortable fit around your waist for long hiking and biking tours. The inner lining is made from high-quality tech-fabric to avoid excessive sweating. The outer envelope is resistant to water, because we all know that in the outdoors, rain happens. 
What does the feelSpace belt do? 
It vibrates! But not just arbitrarily- it signals towards a certain direction: Either the vibration signals magnetic north, letting you know where north is and giving you a new, never before experienced understanding of any environment (compass belt). Or it signals to a destination as the crow flies- for example your hotel, the parking lot where your car is waiting, or your home (navigation belt). Last but not least, it is planned that it guides you from A to B with Routing and turn-by-turn signals. No need to incessantly stare on that smartphone screen anymore! You will always know where to go- and never get lost again. 
Do I need a smartphone to operate the belt? 
The feelSpace compass belt works without Smartphone and is fully functional as a stand-alone device. Using the integrated buttons you can change for instance the vibration intensity. The vibromotor indicating north is active.
The feelSpace navigation belt can display north without using a smartphone, but if you want to use the beeline function or routing function, the smartphone is needed to calculate the directions.
How much does it cost?
Through this campaign you receive the belts for a reduced price. If you order  them through our website (feelSpace.de), a “pure” compass belt will be 749
Euro and the navigation version will be 799 Euro. Here you get a better offer because the prices are in dollar. 
What do I get if I order the compass belt perk?
If you choose the compass belt, you receive a feelSpace belt with compass
functionality plus the instructions. You put the belt on, turn it on by using the integrated buttons and from that moment onwards you continuously know where north is- no matter where you go. This is cool if you already have pretty good orientation and want to make your understanding of spatial relations and localization even better. In scientific studies, we have shown that people who continuously practise with the compass belt for about six weeks start to feel the space around them in a never before experienced manner. Some even say it feels like a new sense! The compass belt works independently of a smartphone. 
What do I get if I order the navigation belt perk?
You get the feelSpace navigation belt and the feelSpace beeline-app that comes with it (first for Android). The belt has all the advantages of the compass belt, i.e. it can indicate north independently of a smartphone app – but on top of that, it also connects wirelessly to your smartphone. Thus, you don’t only know where north is – you can let the belt signal any address or GPS coordinate you are interested in. If we make it to our stretch goal of $50.000, you can get the
package for iPhone. And if we make it to $100.000, we will be able to provide
the full-blown barrier-free navigation app with turn-by-turn navigation functionality! If we don't reach that high goal, it will take us longer but eventually we get there.
In which sizes can I get the feelSpace belt?
The standard sizes cover circumferences of 72 cm (28 inch) to 136 cm (53 inch). Are
you larger or smaller than that? Just pick the tailor-made version perk and we
are glad to carter to all your needs. 
How much does the belt weigh? 
The belt is designed to be very light. The weight is about 450 gr (about 1 pound). 
Can the feelSpace belt replace
traditional aids for impaired persons?
The feelSpace belt cannot replace the traditional white cane for blind people. The white cane is important to detect obstacles on the way such as barriers, holes or the curb. The feelSpace belt additionally provides an overview of where to go and how to get there, so it is a great addition to the white cane! 

Technical questions:
What smartphone do I need for the feelSpace belt?
If you only want compass functionality, you don’t need a smartphone at all. But if you want GPS functionality, it really depends on the funding we are able to get- if you order a naviBelt, you will definitely receive a beeline App for Android 4.0.3
or higher. But if we reach our stretch goals, we will be able to provide an app for
Android and iOS with full navigation turn-by-turn functionality! 
Do I get a technical instruction after receiving the product?
Sure. The belt will come with an instruction manual. 

Shipping:
When can I get the feelSpace belt?
The belt ships in early December 2016. 
Where does feelSpace ship to?
We are able to ship worldwide. Shipping is $5 in Germany; for shipping to another EU-country $15 are added to your order for shipping. Shipping to other countries in the world is $18. Please note that shipping to any country outside of the European Union may be delayed a bit due to necessary certifications, local product approval requirements or local import regulations. There may be additional duties, fees or taxes charged by the the authorities in your country which will be covered at your expense when receiving the shipment.

 Wir sind feelSpace, ein junges innovatives Startup aus Osnabrück, und entwickeln taktile Navigationsgeräte, die dich überall hinbegleiten – beim Wandern, Fahrradfahren, Motorradfahren, Reisen, Spazierengehen oder einfach nur auf dem täglichen Weg von A nach B. Folge einfach deinem Bauchgefühl.
Fühlbar orientierungssicher und entspannt ankommen – so sieht die Navigation von morgen aus! Und das Beste daran: Der Gürtel ist so einfach bedienbar und die Signale sind so intuitiv verständlich, dass wirklich jede/r damit umgehen kann! 
Eigenschaften


Anwendung


Gerne mit dem Fahrrad oder dem Motorrad unterwegs? Wir wissen ja alle, dass man die Hände am Lenker und die Augen auf der Straße behalten sollte. Mit dem naviGürtel werden die Navigationsinformationen direkt auf die Haut übertragen. Genieß die Fahrt und komme entspannt und sicher an!  

Stadtentdecker oder Naturliebhaber? Was, wenn die wunderschöne Altstadt zum Labyrinth wird oder der romantische Wald gar kein Ende mehr nehmen will? Wenn man den wunderbaren Sonnenschein verflucht, weil man sein Display nicht mehr ablesen kann oder im Regen nur noch schnell zum Auto will - nur leider ist die Landkarte durchgeweicht? Mit dem feelSpace naviGürtel sind solche Szenarien Vergangenheit. Kein lästiges Drehen und Wenden der Karte, kein Ärger mit dem Smartphone. Parkplatz und Bahnhof direkt wiederfinden. Und natürlich den Weg aus dem Wald! Weil schöne Städte und wunderbare Natur es verdienen, stressfrei und entspannt erkundet zu werden. 

Zum ersten Mal in Shanghai. Aber muss das denn jeder merken? Tja, wenn man nur auf sein Smartphonedisplay starrt und panisch versucht, die Straßennamen dort mit den Straßenschildern an der Ecke zu vergleichen, dann ist der Coolnessfaktor nicht ganz so hoch. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass die meisten Straßenschilder nur chinesische Zeichen enthalten...! Zum ersten Mal in Shanghai, aber den naviGürtel an? Gar kein Problem. Der Gürtel ist so dünn, dass er unter der Kleidung getragen werden kann - dem Bauchgefühl folgen und fühlbar sicher ankommen! 

Selbst entscheiden, unabhängig ankommen! Egal, ob du seh- oder hörbehindert bist, der Alltag stellt dich vor viele Herausforderungen. Mit dem fühlbaren naviGürtel von feelSpace ist es einfach, selbstständig von A nach B zu kommen. Du ziehst einfach den naviGürtel an, stellst mithilfe deines Smartphones das Ziel per Spracheingabe ein – und schon geht es los. Auf dem Weg hast du Hände, Augen und Ohren frei, um die
Umgebung zu erkunden und Gefahren im Verkehr zu erkennen. Du verläufst dich nicht mehr und fühlst dich selbstbewusst und sicher!



Unser Hintergrund

feelSpace war ursprünglich ein Forschungsprojekt der Universität Osnabrück. Vor über 10 Jahren starteten wir und verwendeten Kompassgürtel, um zu erforschen, ob der Mensch einen Sinn für Norden, wie ihn Zugvögel haben, erlernen kann. Dabei zeigte eine kontinuierliche Vibration rund um die Taille an, wo sich der magnetische Norden relativ zur eigenen Körperausrichtung befindet. Schnell wurde das Signal von unseren Studienteilnehmern nur noch unbewusst wahrgenommen und bereits nach wenigen Wochen waren sie mehr unterwegs, konnten sich besser orientieren und erlebten ihre Umgebung ganz neu. Das Sicherheitsgefühl stieg, da die Teilnehmer besser wussten, wo sie her kamen und hin wollten. Besonders Blinde haben in hohem Maße von den fühlbaren Richtungsanzeige profitiert, da sie für sie einen Ankerpunkt zum Orientieren darstellte.
Viele Teilnehmer wollten den Gürtel nach der Studie nicht zurückgeben und fragten nach einer Möglichkeit ihn zu erwerben. So wurden wir motiviert, aus dem Kompassgürtel für die Forschung eine Version für den Alltag zu machen und die Funktionen zu erweitern, sodass er auch beliebig wählbare Ziele anzeigen kann.
Die Gürtelentwicklung

Im Laufe der letzten 10 Jahre hat sich der Gürtel in seiner Erscheinung gewandelt. Da sich der Forschungsalltag vom privaten Alltag stark unterscheidet, arbeiten wir daran Größe, Gewicht, Bequemlichkeit und Aussehen angenehmer zu gestalten. Im März 2016 konnten wir unseren neuen Prototyp auf der CeBIT präsentiert.

Der naviGürtel entfaltet seine volle Funktionalität im Zusammenspiel mit der feelSpace App. Das Smartphone nimmt die Richtungs- und Wegberechnung vor und sendet Informationen über Bluetooth an den naviGürtel. Der naviGürtel enthält selbst einen Kompass und daher kann sich das Signal optimal relativ zur Körperausrichtung und -bewegung anpassen. Aktuell arbeiten wir an einer App für Android, welche OpenStreetMaps nutzt.
Mit dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne wollen wir den naviGürtel zur Produktionsreife fertig entwickeln und barrierefrei machen.

FAQ

Was genau ist der feelSpace Gürtel? 
Ganz einfach - der feelSpace Gürtel ist ein Navigationsgerät, das Richtungsinformationen fühlbar macht. Der Gürtel besteht aus
Steuerungselektronik, Batterie und 16 Vibrationsmotoren. Wir haben alles so
gestaltet, dass es angenehm zu tragen ist, auch wenn man stundenlang wandert,
Fahrrad fährt oder reist. Die Innenseite besteht aus hochwertigen Stoffen, so
dass man unter dem Gürtel nicht schwitzt. Die Außenhülle ist wasserabweisend,
um Regen oder Spritzwasser abzuhalten. 
Was macht der feelSpace Gürtel? 
Er vibriert! Aber nicht einfach irgendwie - sondern er zeigt eine Richtung
an. Der Kompassgürtel zeigt einem den magnetischen Norden. Mit ein bisschen Training vermittelt er ein ganz neues, nie zuvor erlebtes Raumgefühl. Der naviGürtel kann zusätzlich die Luftlinie zu einer Adresse oder GPS Koordinate anzeigen, zum Beispiel zum Hotel, zum Parkplatz oder nach Hause. Geplant ist, dass der naviGürtel auch Routing und turn-by-turn Routen anzeigen kann - so dass man unterwegs nicht dauernd auf das Smartphone schauen muss. Man weiß einfach immer, wo es lang geht - und kommt fühlbar sicher an. 
Kann ich den Gürtel auch ohne Smartphone nutzen? 
Der feelSpace Kompassgürtel funktioniert komplett ohne Smartphone. Über eingebaute Knöpfe kann man Einstellungen direkt am Gürtel vornehmen, z.B. Intensität der Vibration. Es vibirert immer derjenige Vibromotor, der nach Norden weist.
Der feelSpace naviGürtel kann neben der Smartphone unabhängigen Kompassfunktion auch mit einem Smartphone kommunizieren. Wir entwicklen derzeit die feelSpace App: nach Eingabe eines Ziels führt das Smartphone die Richtungsberechnung durch. Der Gürtel kann dann die Luftlinie zum Ziel und Weginformation ausgeben.
Was kostet der feelSpace Gürtel? Hier über die Kampagne erhältst du eine Preisreduktion auf die Gürtel. Wenn du den Gürtel über unsere Website kaufst, kostet ein Kompassgürtel später 749
Euro und ein NaviGürtel 799 Euro. Hier bekommst du ihn günstiger, denn hier sind alle Preise in Dollar angegeben! 
Was bekomme ich, wenn ich mich für einen Kompassgürtel-Perk entscheide? 
Wer einen Kompassgürtel bestellt, erhält den feelSapce Gürtel mit
Kompassfunktionalität plus eine dazugehörige Gebrauchsanweisung. Man zieht den Gürtel an, schaltet ihn über integrierte Knöpfe an und von da an weiß man immer genau, wo Norden ist - egal, wo man hingeht. Das ist vor allem dann eine coole Sache, wenn man schon ein gutes Orientierungsvermögen mitbringt und sich noch weiter steigern will. In wissenschaftlichen Studien haben wir nachgewiesen, dass Leute, die über mehrere Wochen mit dem Gürtel trainieren, ein völlig neues Raumgefühl erleben. Manche sagen sogar, dass es sich wie ein völlig neuer Sinn anfühlt! 
Was bekomme ich, wenn ich einen naviGürtel-Perk
bestelle? 
Du bekommst den feelSpace naviGürtel und die dazugehörige feelSpace Luftlinien-App (zunächst für Android). Dabei kann die Kompassfunktion des naviGürtels ohne Smartphone verwendet werden. Mit der feelSpace Luftlinien App ist darüber hinaus die Luftlinienfunktion nutzbar und du kannst dir die Richtung zu jeder beliebigen
Adresse oder GPS Koordinate anzeigen lassen. Wenn wir unser erweitertes Ziel von $50.000 erreichen, liefern wir die App auch für iPhone; und wenn wir sogar die $100.000 knacken, gibt es die barrierefreie Navigationsapp mit Routingfunktionalität dazu! Wenn wir diese Ziele nicht erreichen, wird die weitere Entwicklung mehr Zeit in Anspruch nehmen. Dem naviGürtel wird eine Gebrauchsanweisung beiliegen.
In welchen Größen gibt es den feelSpace Gürtel? 
Unsere Standardgrößen können einen Bauchumfang von 72 cm (28 inch) bis hin zu
136 cm (53 inch) abdecken. Brauchen Sie einen kleineren oder größeren
Gürtel? Dann einfach den „maßgeschneidert“ Perk auswählen, wir schneidern den
Gürtel dann individuell nach Ihren Bedürfnissen zu. 
Was wiegt der Gürtel? 
Der Gürtel ist super leicht und wiegt maximal 450 g. 
Kann der Gürtel traditionelle Blindenhilfsmittel wie z.B. den Langstock ersetzen? 
Nein, das kann und will der Gürtel nicht. Gerade der Langstock ist sehr
wichtig im Alltag, um Dellen im Boden, die Bordsteinkante oder Hindernisse auf
dem Weg zu erkennen. Der Gürtel dient dazu, Orte, die sich in einiger Distanz
befinden, fühlbar zu machen. Und natürlich den Weg dorthin zu zeigen! 

Technische Fragen 
Kann man jedes Smartphone mit dem Gürtel verbinden? 
Wer einen Kompassgürtel möchte, braucht gar kein Smartphone, aber für GPS Funktionalität schon. Welche Betriebssysteme wir unterstützen können, hängt auch davon ab, wieviel Geld wir hier einnehmen. Was wir auf jeden Fall versprechen können, ist eine Luftlinie App, die mit Android 4.0.3 oder höher
kompatibel ist. Aber wenn wir mehr als unser Ziel erreichen, dann entwickeln
wir die App auch für iPhone zeitnah. 
Bekomme ich eine
Gebrauchsanweisung mit dem Gürtel? 
Selbstverständlich! 

Versand
Wann bekomme ich den Gürtel zugesendet, wenn ich ihn heute kaufe? 
Wir fangen im Dezember 2016 mit der Auslieferung an. 
Wohin wird geliefert?
Wir liefern weltweit. Der Versand kostet $5, wenn der Gürtel
nach Deutschland verschickt werden soll, wenn er in andere EU-Länder verschickt werden soll, kostet es $15. Der Versand in andere Länder kostet $18. Bestellungen aus Ländern außerhalb der europäischen Union können eventuell etwas später geliefert
werden, je nach den Zertifizierungen und Produktregularien der Länder.
Möglicherweise kommen dann noch extra Kosten beim Abholen des Gürtels im
Zollamt dazu. Diese können wir leider nicht übernehmen. 

Allgemeine Fragen 
Ich möchte meine Bestellung zurücknehmen. Wie geht das? 
Das ist natürlich sehr schade! Es gibt einen einfachen Weg,
das mit Indiegogo abzuklären: How To Request
a Refund. Nicht ganz sattelfest im Englischen? Sie können uns gerne

Through family and friends I have connected with a network of seamstresses in Tanzania who improvise on my patterns, choose their own local Kanga fabric, and make beautiful handmade handbags, wristlets, bracelets, skirts, pants and more. 
Women are able to work at home or together and share some resources and markets. They are able to work their own hours and at their own pace. They are able to provide food, clothing, and education for their children. Creating opportunities for them to learn how to be an entrepreneur themselves is most meaningful to me.

The Bauhaus style takes a minimalist approach to design and features clean lines with bold, simple coloration. The design process was from the ground up in order to create a truly bespoke timepiece. As such, we used as few stock parts as possible. Our white dial Heritage Edition watches feature our signature blue second hand, while all options feature the following:
Double-domed sapphire crystal 
Dauphine minute and hour hands
316L Stainless steel
Water resistant 3ATM
20 uM plating

  The CaseThe Heritage Edition watch has a simple, beautiful bespoke case. It was designed to sit comfortably on your wrist, while having a sleek and elegant look. You'll notice that the lugs are curved downwards on the outer edges - this is to hug your wrist and create maximum comfort when strapped on. We've also created a few layers of tapering that create beautiful reflections when worn. Our Heritage Edition also features a unique, continuous cut along the side of the case from one end to the other, giving this minimalist watch an extra eye-catching element.

<h3>- Not only will we make these desperately needed items EASILY AVAILABLE, we will make them at roughly <em>1/10th</em> the price, and eventually even lower.</h3>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>We have been making the highest quality, most versatile and innovative 'Devil' Horns, and many other types of horns, since 1999.  As we like to say, based on our clear-stretchy-headband innovation, ""<strong>Pan's Devil Horns can make anyone 'horny' in 15 seconds or less with no mess</strong>!""</p>
<p>But, enough about the horns, we are about so much more . . .</p>
<p><strong>Our project's goal is to make ANY costuming fantasy a reality</strong> by creating  affordable custom, and one-of-a-kind prosthetics and costume accessories. These include silicone masks and silicone prosthetics with an amazingly life-like look and feel, resin prosthetics, resin props and many other accessories that have, till now, been unavailable anywhere. Not only will we make them in  custom colors, shapes and materials, but custom fit to the exact shape of the clients body. </p>
<p><strong>Your support will help us get the equipment we need in order to create these items,</strong> the most expensive of which is a <strong>3D Laser Scanner.  </strong>This equipment, along with 3D Printers and other rapid prototyping tools now available, will allow us to create the desired items that have previously been impossible to make with our current techniques. </p>
<p><strong>Your help also comes with some Perks.</strong> Not only will you be helping us to help others, you will recieve some special 'rewards':</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a <strong>15% ongoing discount code</strong> good for a full year on our website: <a href=""http://pansdevilhorns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PansDevilHorns.com</a>
</li>
<li>At higher levels you will get your choice of some of our<strong> extremely versatile horns</strong>
</li>
<li>If you are feeling particularly generous, you can have us make <strong>an item</strong> of your choice <strong>PRINTED in 3D</strong>!</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Most Perks will ship out within a week</strong> (or sooner) </em>of you contributing and notifying us of your Perk Choice.  The October 15 estimated delivery date is for last minute contributors.<br/><br/><br/>

<h2>Why are we doing this and who will it help?</h2>
<p>Over the past decade there has been a steady increase in the number of people involved in some type of LARP (Live Action Role Playing) or CosPlay and they now make up the majority of our customers. These people are very dedicated to their character and thus their costume, but are having trouble making the pieces of their costume that are pivotal to making their character 'come to life.' They often try to make it themselves, but many of these pieces require the expertise and experience of a professional. This is where we come in.  </p>
<p>They come to us to make the items they can't find or make themselves.  The problem is that using the standard methods for creating the custom items they require costs hundreds to thousands of dollars! As hard as we have tried to reduce these costs, we have hit the limits of cost reduction with the standard methods and materials.</p>
<p>With 3D Scanning and Printing, we can now drastically reduce these costs by 4 to 10 times and finally offer these pivotal items at a price they can afford.  <strong>With your help, we will make Hollywood-like custom costume accessories that are affordable AND as unique as the people who wear them! </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Why we are so passionate about this project!</h2>
<p>We absolutely love it when we can help make people's fantasy come true by adding that unique piece to their costume that will help them become the perfect embodiment of their fantasy character. With today's challenging times and uncertain future, it is fantasy and hope that helps us make it through to better times. In addition, it is fantasy and imagination that fuels and sparks the ideas and inventions that will bring about those better times.</p>

<h2>
<em>Prosthetic Adhesive </em>- Group A</h2>
<p>For those of you with <strong>no hair</strong>, or who want to glue horns directly on your skin, <strong>Prosthetic Adhesive</strong> is the second strongest skin-safe glue on the market and cleans off with soap and water. (<strong>Medical Adhesive</strong> in Group C is THE strongest but requires a remover). By comparison, Prosthetic Adhesive is many, many times stronger than spirit-gum and will work very well on all our horns, provided you are not spending a night dancing or head-banging - if you do plan on an ""athletic"" night out, we recommend the Medical Adhesive in Group C below.</p>

<em>Medical Adhesive &amp; Remover  </em>- Group C</h2>
<p>For people who have <strong>no hair</strong> or want to glue horns directly on their skin, Medical Adhesive is THE strongest skin-safe glue available. Twice as strong as Prosthetic Adhesive and about 6 times stronger than spirit-gum, there is nothing stronger that is safe for use on skin. It is so strong it requires a special remover which is included.  </p>

- We are raising funds to buy a 3D Laser Scanner
- This is necessary for us to create CUSTOM MOLDED costume accessories and silicone masks for Halloween, LARP and CosPlay enthusiasts.
- Currently Custom Molded items are either UNAVAILABLE or are insanely expensive ($1,000 and UP)
- Not only will we make these desperately needed items EASILY AVAILABLE, we will make them at roughly 1/10th the price, and eventually even lower.
- For our PERKS we have 36 'flavors' of our very popular and easy to wear, 'no-mess' Devil Horns.
- With HALLOWEEN quickly approaching, they are a perfect way to make any outfit a ""HORNY"" costume! They also make a great present for the person who has [almost] everything!
   

  

 
Project Details
We have been making the highest quality, most versatile and innovative 'Devil' Horns, and many other types of horns, since 1999.  As we like to say, based on our clear-stretchy-headband innovation, ""Pan's Devil Horns can make anyone 'horny' in 15 seconds or less with no mess!""
But, enough about the horns, we are about so much more . . .
Our project's goal is to make ANY costuming fantasy a reality by creating  affordable custom, and one-of-a-kind prosthetics and costume accessories. These include silicone masks and silicone prosthetics with an amazingly life-like look and feel, resin prosthetics, resin props and many other accessories that have, till now, been unavailable anywhere. Not only will we make them in  custom colors, shapes and materials, but custom fit to the exact shape of the clients body. 
Your support will help us get the equipment we need in order to create these items, the most expensive of which is a 3D Laser Scanner.  This equipment, along with 3D Printers and other rapid prototyping tools now available, will allow us to create the desired items that have previously been impossible to make with our current techniques. 
Your help also comes with some Perks. Not only will you be helping us to help others, you will recieve some special 'rewards':

You will receive a 15% ongoing discount code good for a full year on our website: PansDevilHorns.com

At higher levels you will get your choice of some of our extremely versatile horns

If you are feeling particularly generous, you can have us make an item of your choice PRINTED in 3D!

Most Perks will ship out within a week (or sooner) of you contributing and notifying us of your Perk Choice.  The October 15 estimated delivery date is for last minute contributors.

Perk List (for your contributions):

Why are we doing this and who will it help?
Over the past decade there has been a steady increase in the number of people involved in some type of LARP (Live Action Role Playing) or CosPlay and they now make up the majority of our customers. These people are very dedicated to their character and thus their costume, but are having trouble making the pieces of their costume that are pivotal to making their character 'come to life.' They often try to make it themselves, but many of these pieces require the expertise and experience of a professional. This is where we come in.  
They come to us to make the items they can't find or make themselves.  The problem is that using the standard methods for creating the custom items they require costs hundreds to thousands of dollars! As hard as we have tried to reduce these costs, we have hit the limits of cost reduction with the standard methods and materials.
With 3D Scanning and Printing, we can now drastically reduce these costs by 4 to 10 times and finally offer these pivotal items at a price they can afford.  With your help, we will make Hollywood-like custom costume accessories that are affordable AND as unique as the people who wear them! 
 
    
 
Why we are so passionate about this project!
We absolutely love it when we can help make people's fantasy come true by adding that unique piece to their costume that will help them become the perfect embodiment of their fantasy character. With today's challenging times and uncertain future, it is fantasy and hope that helps us make it through to better times. In addition, it is fantasy and imagination that fuels and sparks the ideas and inventions that will bring about those better times.

<p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit our campaign here on IndieGoGo. </p>
<p>I am a native Haitian fashion designer who has been living and working in New York City for nearly 20 years. I am an expert in recycling, and on my most recent trips to Haiti, I was struck by the continued suffering after the earthquake which struck in 2010.</p>
<p>People are still living in the U.S.A.I.D. tarp tents, and as the governement try to re-house people, they are leaving behind tons of items that are not biodegradable, creating a new ecologic disaster.</p>
<p>There is also a lack of jobs because of the damaged infrastructure in the country. Many women in Haiti have superb sewing skills, but no machine to use, or no materials, or no access to wealthy markets like the United States in which to sell their goods.</p>
<p>My campaign would enable them to take all the tents that are being left behind and transform them into durable items, upcycling them into a variety of sturdy bags and other accessories which are water-proof. The most popular version of the tote, for example, can save countless supermarket shopping bags and yet can roll up or fold up easily.</p>

<p>These items will also support a school that I have been helping which is already doing so much good for the most deprived children around Croix-des-Bouquets in Haiti. As you can see, the metal schoolhouse-church in Kafou Chada has no windows, no bathroom and only two small doors, but for these children it is a palace of learning.</p>

<p>I have been making all the bags myself by hand up until this point, so this project will enable me to open a workshop to train the women on the best ways to work with the really sturdy tent fabric and provide them with the heavy-duty industrial machines required for the task.</p>

RISKS & CHALLENGES
Experience & Capable ManufacturersWe have worked with several manufacturers in our past, producing items from sweatshirts to laundry bags, including 4 different sunglasses manufacturers.
What you are seeing are prototypes, so expect the final product to be polished and of even higher quality. We went through 30+ iterations until we landed on our perfected design -- it's a detailed process requiring 3D modeling, rendering and more.
Luckily we have a long standing relationship with our manufacturer and project managers. Each and every prior order we have made was delivered on time. There has not been a logistical complication to date!

Logistics can get fairly complex and occasionally mishaps do happen that can’t be planned for. However, we assure you that we have taken proactive steps in order to mitigate these risks and are prepared to handle any adversity.
We already have confirmation from both our manufacturer and our fulfillment center that they can handle 5,000 orders.
TransparencyWe believe in transparency and authentic communication. Our contributors will be the first people we notify concerning any unplanned obstacles. Every contributor should feel free to ask us a question (contact@felloeyewear.com) and no one should feel as if they are left in the dark.

<p>The Wine Key Card is an extremely thin credit card sized
wine cork remover. It uses small blades instead of a cork screw, making it the
thinnest cork remover on the market. At 1.4 mm thick (about 2 credit cards) it
is able to fit snugly in your wallet. The Wine Key Card also has a serrated blade
for removing the wine bottle wrapper and a bottle cap opener for beer bottles.
The prototype you see here I have been using for almost a year and have opened
over 60 bottles of wine with it !</p>

<p>A regular spiral type cork screw is to bulky to fit in the pocket of a wallet,but the Patent Pending Cork Blade allows the Wine Key
Card to be very thin. It utilizes small blades extending laterally from a shaft
to bore into and remove the cork .It took over 10 prototypes to get the best
combination of: angle of attack, lateral extension, blades shape and type of
durable metal to get to where we are today. The Cork Blade can remove any type
of cork, synthetic or natural.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/297040/files/20140107220528-CorkBladeIndicator.png?1389161128"" src="""" style=""width: 138.51194539249147px; height: 228px;""/></p><br/><p></p>

<p></p><p>The cork blade does not leave any debris in the bottle.
That is because the cork blade never pierces the bottom of the cork. The blade
has a red indicator line and when the indicator line touches the wine cork it
means the blade has reached the correct depth. As you can see in the picture, the
cork blade does leave a bigger hole in the cork than a conventional cork screw,
but that will not affect your wine drinking experience one bit! The only major operating
difference between a cork screw and wine blade is that you need to apply
pressure the cork blade while rotating the device. </p>

<p>During the initial consultation, Ms. Galan, identifies the
clients skin type: dry, oily or combination. She also inquires about the type
of makeup the client prefers and the amount of coverage. Ms. Galan spends time
demonstrating and emphasizing proper cleansing and prepping of the face to
create a flawless appearance. Her trained eye allows her to combine the unique
hues and create custom shades of foundation that are all hypoallergenic,
fragrance free and non-comedogenic.  Ms.
Galan allows clients to wear the product all day and sends a sample home. Clients
are encouraged to experiment and work with the product.  Upon client satisfaction, the custom shade is
ordered and delivered to the client.</p>
<p>Once we reach our goal of bringing Klee
Cosmetics to retail stores this process would be carried out by trained Klee
Makeup Professionals at the retail locations.</p>

Please note: All orders received for makeup, custom bags and v-necks will be shipped in August.  Please refer to your email for a personalized delivery time. What People
Are Saying About Us!""The Klee cosmetic line is my new favorite with perfectly matched moisturizing bases, beautiful eye colors and an amazing concealer that does not cake even after a late night at the Grammy's!"" Lisa Sumja
""I love Klee Cosmetics because it not only looks great, but it feels great to wear.  Her foundation covered up exactly what I was looking to cover, all while being gentle and kind to my skin. "" Gail Katz
Our founder
Mary Galan, a veteran of the hair and beauty industry,
noticed there was something major missing in the cosmetics market—makeup that matches the diverse array of mixed skin tones that we see in our growing ethnic populations.
Her inspiration?
After the birth of her daughter Kaylee, a beautiful baby girl with brown eyes
and caramel complexion, she knew finding makeup that matched her unique
skin tone would be a huge problem.  Wanting to make that problem a non-issue Mary developed Klee Cosmetics. 
                                                 Custom shades for flawless coverage and
luminous skinOur goal is to create custom shades of foundation, lipstick and shadow to help every woman enhance their unique beauty. 
                             Klee Cosmetics is a scintillating line of cosmetic products that caters to all ethnicities. Our MissionWe have
started customizing, blending, and offering our custom cosmetic line to a few
clients but our mission is to bring our custom cosmetic line to major retail
stores so that every woman gets the chance to enhance her own unique beauty no
matter what color, shade, or tone. Every woman deserves to step out with flawless makeup, a luminous face
and radiant confidence.                                       Custom Color Matching
During the initial consultation, Ms. Galan, identifies the
clients skin type: dry, oily or combination. She also inquires about the type
of makeup the client prefers and the amount of coverage. Ms. Galan spends time
demonstrating and emphasizing proper cleansing and prepping of the face to
create a flawless appearance. Her trained eye allows her to combine the unique
hues and create custom shades of foundation that are all hypoallergenic,
fragrance free and non-comedogenic.  Ms.
Galan allows clients to wear the product all day and sends a sample home. Clients
are encouraged to experiment and work with the product.  Upon client satisfaction, the custom shade is
ordered and delivered to the client.
Once we reach our goal of bringing Klee
Cosmetics to retail stores this process would be carried out by trained Klee
Makeup Professionals at the retail locations.
                             



How You Can Help
Due to the initial cost and quantity for a minimum order we need your help to get a product in supply. 
Your support will help us attend a major retail show so we can make connections to get Klee Cosmetics into major retail shops. 
Setup our website
Once we accomplish this we hope to make custom shades available worldwide.

We appreciate all contributions and would
love for you to SHARE, SHARE, SHARE!


 Like us on Facebook and Follow us on Twitter @KleeCosmetics. Help us build our fan base and
spread our mission to bring a makeup line custom made for every skin color,
shade and tone in the world.  The cosmetic giants have been slow to develop products, and often their
products look chalky, do not blend well with natural skin tones and crease in
the fine lines and pores of these unique skin types.
What You Get When You ContributeThere are multiple
perks available ranging from $5 on up to whatever you're willing to
contribute.  Each contribution level comes with an associated perk, so get  ""eye wink xxx"" , ""muahh gratitude"" and ""on board with Klee"" and help us attend the Los Angeles Ultimate Woman's Expo so we can connect and demonstrate custom Klee Cosmetics to retailers.

<p></p>
<p>Supporting Ovarian Cancer Knowledge (SOCK) was founded by the
late Jane Keating <span>following her diagnosis with ovarian cancer in August
2009 at the young age of 28. Jane vowed to promote awareness of ovarian cancer amongst
the women of Ireland. SOCK is a non-profit organisation and is dedicated to raising funds for research into and awareness of ovarian cancer.</span></p>
<p>SOCK became very aware that there are leaflets in
doctors’ surgeries in relation to breast cancer, <span>lung cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer etc., however, not for ovarian cancer. In fact, SOCK noticed that there was
no information available to women in relation to the symptoms of ovarian cancer. This lack of
information can lead to misdiagnosis and late diagnosis. In addition, lack of information is one of
the reasons why many women believe that smear tests which test for cervical cancer will identify
ovarian cancer when in fact this is not the case. SOCK is not sponsored by a government body which means we are totally reliant on fund raising activities to fund initiatives and research.  We are delighted to have
partnered with <i>Pairz</i> <i>® </i>and are overwhelmed by the positive response so far.  Through this partnership we hope to make a real difference, and educate people all over the World by providing the knowledge needed to tackle this illness at full force, ensuring Jane's legacy lives on. </span></p>

isn’t about making huge profits it’s about getting these knickers to as many
people as possible.</p>
<p><b>#2) Setting our goal lower, so we can start
production and get rewards to you sooner. </b>The second we hit our $15k goal you
will be able to pick your sizes, styles and colours. We’ve also got some great
stretch goals planned.</p>
<p><b>#3) Colours: </b>You asked for them, and you’ve
got them. </p>
<p><b>#4) Choice of technology</b>: We want you to
find the pair that is right for you, so now you can pick the level of
protection you want and sweat hard with confidence. </p>

Thank you for visiting our campaign. 
Our Story: 
A year ago, we launched Knix Wear with an
Indiegogo campaign. We received a tremendous amount of support from women all
over the world and a lot of the great ideas that have made Knix Wear what it is
today came from our first campaign. We were lucky enough to be featured in a
ton of great media outlets, including Fast Company, The Financial Post,
WWD, Forbes and dozens more. We also made crowdfunding history by becoming the first
campaign to be picked up by a major retailer. You can watch that story here.The new FITKNIX:
At Knix Wear, our
mission is to make your every day better and that includes your workout. As with everything we do, we started by
listening to women and what they want. The hard truth is that women aren't satisfied by their existing athletic underwear - so much so that 10% opt to not wear any at all. Panty-lines, leaks, sweat stains, chaffing and odor are all top of mind. There are a ton of big athletic apparel
brands out there making underwear, but it’s a small part of their business and
as result existing products are missing the mark. For the big guys, female underwear
is almost an after thought – For us, it is our only thought.Stretch Goals Added:LIMITED TIME PERK- At Knix Wear we are proud to be a Canadian company and we couldn't be more proud of our Canadian athletes. In fact, we're so proud that we will be releasing a limited run of honorary underwear so we can all remember what is possible with dedication, focus and team work. We learned a lot from our first campaign, and
so we are doing things a bit differently this time.
#1) Better pricing. You are helping to bring
this product to life and as a result you deserve better pricing. For us, this
isn’t about making huge profits it’s about getting these knickers to as many
people as possible.
#2) Setting our goal lower, so we can start
production and get rewards to you sooner. The second we hit our $15k goal you
will be able to pick your sizes, styles and colours. We’ve also got some great
stretch goals planned.
#3) Colours: You asked for them, and you’ve
got them. 
#4) Choice of technology: We want you to
find the pair that is right for you, so now you can pick the level of
protection you want and sweat hard with confidence.

<p><strong>The Story: </strong></p>
<p>My name is Yasmina and I am the Founder of ALWAN COSMETICS. I started making makeup in my dorm room my Freshman year and opened an Etsy shop selling my handmade eyeshadows and highlighters. Over the course of a year, I tested my makeup on every willing person I could find, ensuring that the products were as vibrant on the palest shades as on the deepest ones.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<p>As an Arab woman, I never felt represented by the cosmetic industry. I wanted to make a bold statement of my pride in my heritage and the skin I am in, and I hope to help other young Arabs and women of color to feel confident in their culture and unique beauty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I noticed that pigmented eyeshadows for darker skin tones were hard to find. So, I created the Mirage palette which was made to pop on all skin tones. It includes three duochromes<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>, three shimmers, and three mattes. The palette is incredibly versatile, leaving you to create a basic matte look, a </span>poppin<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> pink, a blue, a gold, or many colors in between - and each row is made to be an easy look. If you look across you will find:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>- a gold duochrome, a deep gold, a white matte in the first row</p>
<p>-a pink duochrome, vibrant pink, and a tan matte in the second row</p>
<p>- a duochrome blue, bright blue, and matte black in the bottom row</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Inclusivity is not just about the appearance of the product. Inclusivity is about the ingredients in the product. We know Muslims, Jews, vegans, and cruelty-free customers need products that they can trust. With ALWAN you don't have to compromise your look for your ethics. It's always a package deal for us.</p>
<p>ALWAN is more than a beauty brand. It is a statement of pride and confidence in your unique background and style.</p>

<ul>
<li>We need upwards of 10k in order to purchase machinery. I am hand-making makeup in my apartment. This is not a viable business model as I scale up. I need funding to be able to purchase machinery to fill lip gloss tubes and press eyeshadows perfectly as it is incredibly difficult and ineffecient to conduct without professional tools - it's like trying to play football with a pinecone.</li>
<li>We also need funding to obtain copyrights on our shade names and collections, as well as seeking protection for our unique formulas.</li>
<li>We need this funding to scale up production and continue developing new products. </li>
<li>If we fail to reach our goal, we will continue searching used cosmetic machinery sales and continue selling hand-made products in the meantime. Every dollar can go towards something, whether it is purchasing packaging, restocking pigment powders or raw materials, or running advertisements. </li>

<br/>Titanium is the strongest metal for its weight, which allows you to use your sunglassesactively without worrying about them breaking.These sunglasses are made from the same materials used in a Fighter jet, F1 Race Car, Lamborghini, Bugatti Veyron and many ultra-luxury watches. The Hughes are extremely strong, but also deceptively light. Titanium is also hypoallergenic, meaning it is perfectly safe for the human body. Doctors use the element forhip and knee replacements for this reason.<br/><br/><b>ARMOUR COATING</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434678339/ed0nk5indp8l8aeajlwf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>You are an active person, who needs eyewear that can keep up. We examined drill bits, knives, firearms and F1 race car pistons. From this, we developed our own titanium protective coating.

This stuff is strong...like military strong.<br/><br/><b>REAR WEIGHTED BALANCE</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434678361/yvhdbh3huzwuknyfhfof.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Ever had sunglasses fall down your nose? We HATE that! Proper sunglass fitment is taken to heart.

<br/>Lenses are taken VERY seriously around here. What's the point in making awesome sunglasses if the optics are crappy? We literally searched all around the world looking at various types of lenses. From Glass, Polycarbonate, CR39, Acrylic, and Nylon. Each one hasits merits but we wanted something truly exceptional. We are extremely proud to introduce William Painter's Lifelong Lenses.They are the lightest in the world, less than half the weight of traditional glass lenses.

<br/>Polarized lenses neutralizes glare, clear up objects and reduce eye strain. They work especially well on car windshields, oceans or lakes and other high glare environments. Typically lenses have a polarizing and tint coating added to the top of the lens to achieve this effect. Over time, however, the polarizing and tint can bubble and flake off of the lens. Have you everseen a bad tint job on a car? Same problem. Our LifeLong Lenses go one step further.

Completely reengineered to be strong, light, perfectly balanced, fit comfortably, and have incredible optics.


Purchase any of our William Painter Collection...Finally, the perfect aviator-style sunglasses

Most sunglasses are flimsy, break easily, fit terribly, and are marked up to ridiculous prices. One company owns nearly 90% of the sunglasses market and has slowed innovation and price fixed eyewear. William Painter is changing this by completely re-engineering classic styles, using state of the art materials, and cutting out the middle man. This is the first campaign ever where we will have all of our products offered as perks in support of the development of The Hughes!

A complete new approach to how sunglasses are designed and constructed. 


What makes The Hughes different from other shades?


What does that mean for you?They're a new level of quality, durability, perfect balance, the best optics and fitamazingly - allowing you to be you.

<p>We are two sisters from Venezuela. We are obsessed about graphic design and we love to share our vision with the world. Rather than an actual physical studio, picture us living in 2 different cities (Los Angeles and San Diego) making our <a href=""http://www.daridesignstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">design studio</a> out of every space where the creative process happens. Even though we rely on technology 100% to keep us connected in business, we share an amazing bond that allows our design magic to happen with ease and grace.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/200/651/76719c429a7202b89c36f2979ec9641f_large.jpg?1349848930"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Our designs are eye-catching. We have developed a portfolio of a variety of innovative designs that reflect our multicultural influences crossed with the modern trends of today. Our designs hold the potential to develop into a unique brand yet still converge into today's audience demands.</p>
<p>This project is all about supporting us to get to the big Trade Show <a href=""http://www.surtex.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SURTEX</a> 2013 in New York City in May 2013 - where we can have the opportunity to connect to buyers from around the world. We hope that your support of our design collections will make a big impression at this important event!</p>
<p>Along this page is a sneak peak of our designs. We wish we could show more but we need to be copyright cautious.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/200/653/0d2869b2f31e1cb1aa2b8d0bf083ab5d_large.jpg?1349848960"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Here is a scoop of our plans..</strong></p>
<p>This show will be a key platform to expand our business into the licensing industry... So we are building an extensive portfolio of our original art, so that when we connect with potencial buyers everything is in place for buyers to take our designs out to the world.</p>
<p>Besides designing, designing and more designing we've taken care of more than the basics. We have paid for our booth, made flight and hotel reservations, designed our promotional material and started to design our booth decoration. Now, here is where we need your help: once the booth decoration and the promo material are ready for production we'll need to cover the following:</p>
<p><strong>The money that you donate to the project will go directly toward funding the following expenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Printing promotional materials </li>
<li>Marketing Campaign</li>
<li>Furniture and general decoration for the booth </li>
<li>Shipping all those materials (for booth decoration to NYC) </li>
</ul><p>Funding will also go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copyrighting our art</li>
<li>Printing and building Hardcover Portfolios</li>
<li>Purchasing the technology necessary to show our art during the trade show</li>

Rather than an actual physical studio, picture us living in 2 different cities (Los Angeles and San Diego) making our design studio out of every space where the creative process happens. Even though we rely on technology 100% to keep us connected in business, we share an amazing bond that allows our design magic to happen with ease and grace.

Our designs are eye-catching. We have developed a portfolio of a variety of innovative designs that reflect our multicultural influences crossed with the modern trends of today. Our designs hold the potential to develop into a unique brand yet still converge into today's audience demands.
This project is all about supporting us to get to the big Trade Show SURTEX 2013 in New York City in May 2013 - where we can have the opportunity to connect to buyers from around the world. We hope that your support of our design collections will make a big impression at this important event!
Along this page is a sneak peak of our designs. We wish we could show more but we need to be copyright cautious.

Here is a scoop of our plans..
This show will be a key platform to expand our business into the licensing industry... So we are building an extensive portfolio of our original art, so that when we connect with potencial buyers everything is in place for buyers to take our designs out to the world.
Besides designing, designing and more designing we've taken care of more than the basics. We have paid for our booth, made flight and hotel reservations, designed our promotional material and started to design our booth decoration. Now, here is where we need your help: once the booth decoration and the promo material are ready for production we'll need to cover the following:
The money that you donate to the project will go directly toward funding the following expenses:

Printing promotional materials 
Marketing Campaign
Furniture and general decoration for the booth 
Shipping all those materials (for booth decoration to NYC) 
Funding will also go towards:

Copyrighting our art
Printing and building Hardcover Portfolios
Purchasing the technology necessary to show our art during the trade show

THE BEST SUPPORT YOU CAN GIVE US IS TO PLEDGE FOR US!
Thank you so much! for your pledge. We hope you’ll not only help us make our dream a reality by supporting and donating to our project, but to also help us spread the word far and wide! We are counting on you!!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Simply put, we want people to wear our shirts and we want to help great causes.  We design comfy, quality screen printed shirts inspired by our own vintage and modern style t-shirt collections.  Our shirts are sold to benefit various charities and causes that, in some way or another, have become important to us.  As well as selling our shirts to benefit some well known charities, we also offer an avenue for people to contact us with their own personal cause, we will design and print shirts to benefit them.  We feel that we can make shirts that people will not only feel good about buying, but will also want to wear.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope to impact many various charities and causes through the sales of our shirts.  We also want to spread the word and encourage people to contact us with their own cause that they would like us to support.  It would be a great feeling for us to know that the more we were able to help these causes, the more people are walking around in our shirts - and vice-versa.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set a goal of $1500 to help us get MiMA off the ground.  If we meet our goal this money would be used primarily to print shirts, and a small amount may go towards possible website improvements.  In the unfortunate event that we don't reach our goal, donations here will be returned and we will seek out other sources of funding to ultimately make our project a success.</p>

This is usually done by printing a masking window on the underside of the watch’s lens. What always irritated us, is that the black of the LCD, and the black of the mask are essentially the same. However, when they are overlapped, the light is refracted, so they always look different. The window’s shape stands out, and is not particularly related to the watch’s overall design.

<p>Normal Timepieces was founded by Ross, and Madoka McBride in 2006. Ross is from the United States, but has lived more than half of his life in Tokyo. Madoka is from Hiroshima. Their motivations for creating this brand is an analogy to their relationship itself. It was founded on the combined influences of pioneering mid-century American design, as well as the Japanese sense of minimalism, and craftsmanship. Wikie Sato joined this team in 2015. Her previous experience was perfectly tailored to Normal with her Hong Kong upbringing, graphic design studies in Australia, and work experience the Japanese fashion industry.</p>

The direct translation from this Japanese is “time numerals” The seven segment digit was patented in 1903 for a method of telegraphically transmitting numbers to be printed on tape. The first digital wrist watch was an LED prototype in 1970. Perhaps this type of digit is fading away as our interface design, and display technologies advance, but let’s not forget how they have taken such a prominent place in the background of our everyday lives. Our new Tokiji watch gives them the respect they deserve. These vivid digits are generously spaced on a rich, black dial, surrounded by a handsome, minimal case.  This watch features a striking display based on a unique approach that we have spent years developing. This breakthrough process is something that we began to develop with our original digital watch, but have refined this process for Tokiji.All digital watches hide the frame of their liquid crystal display (LCD). This is usually done by printing a masking window on the underside of the watch’s lens. What always irritated us, is that the black of the LCD, and the black of the mask are essentially the same. However, when they are overlapped, the light is refracted, so they always look different. The window’s shape stands out, and is not particularly related to the watch’s overall design. It is simply something that the watch designer has to work around.Our digital display eliminates this problem with an original process developed by us. After much trial and error,  we found the best way to remove all of the air, and space from between the lens, and the LCD display, so the light can pass straight through. Because the light is now uninhibited, both of these blacks line up perfectly. This allows us to eliminate the window all together, and make our mask the shape of the actual display graphics. The result of this process makes for a very deep, and consistent black across the entire watch face to accentuate its vivid digits.

Metallium*(Liquid Metal) and

The Watch design concept is 
inspired in part from art,  and by famous sci-fi movies  
""Terminator"". For many years have we dreamed to use an amazing Liquid Metal as a 
technology of the future - that can function and change into any shape; just like the morphing metal seen in the ""Terminator"" movies - but in a less ominous way 
of course!

Now, after many years of 
search and research, we found a new material called 'Metallium'*.  We studied it, 
learned to program it, and found a way to use it in this world First Ever Invention - The Liquid Metal Display Watch!


LMD* (Liquid Metal Display*)


We are excited to share With 
YOU, our first backers, this World's 1st - A Watch using the 'liquid metal display'* of

We inspect packets of data coming and leaving your network and block threats before they can reach the target or do damage. We analyze behavior and secure all devices connected to your network. This is critical because newly connected devices don't have pre-installed security.</div>
<div style=""margin-bottom:10px;""> </div>
<div style=""margin-bottom:10px;"">Unlike traditional solutions, CUJO adapts and reacts when your home is attacked and does not rely just on libraries of known malware issues.

<h2 style=""padding-bottom:5px;"">FAQ</h2>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">1. What is the device's range? Same as my router? What if I have a big mansion with devices on three floors?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">CUJO connects to your router with an Ethernet cable, so range is not applicable since CUJO does not need to connect to each individual device to offer protection. If your device receives signal from your router, rest assured CUJO has it covered.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">2. Will CUJO connect to my network?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">To connect CUJO to your network you need to have a wireless router or extender. If you have two wireless routers at home, connect CUJO with an Ethernet cable to the router that you want to protected.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">3. If someone else comes to my home with their tablet, laptop or phone and connects to my internet, will CUJO protect it?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">When a visitor comes to your home and connects to the internet using your WiFi log in information, their devices will have full protection while they're connected.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">4. If CUJO doesn't recognize a device, will it shut the device down?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">CUJO will never shut down your connected devices. If it recognizes malicious activity in your network that is attacking a device, CUJO will block the hack or stop the activity on the back end without affecting the device itself. You can, however, choose to shut down any connected device using your CUJO app.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">5. Can CUJO be used for small business? At what point would I get a consumer product vs. enterprise product to protect my small business?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">While the device is powerful enough to protect some small businesses, that market isn't our focus. Our reasoning? Since homes are most vulnerable to attacks, the safety and security of your home is where the bulk of our efforts lie.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">6. How many devices does CUJO protect at once?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">To date we have not hit the ceiling, so this answer remains “to be determined.” That being said, our hardware is powerful enough to handle capacity in 99 percent of homes. This means CUJO is able to protect 50+ devices simultaneously.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">7. What is the Indiegogo campaign close date?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">The campaign closes on November 13, 2015.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">8. If I live outside of the U.S., can I purchase CUJO and reap all its benefits?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">Customers in Canada and the European Union can purchase CUJO to protect their homes. Even though the device will work elsewhere, the U.S., Canada and the European Union are the countries/regions we are focusing on from the regulatory and service perspective. Australia? Yes, your CUJO will work perfectly well in Australia. Please note that you may have to pay duties and taxes when shipping a CUJO outside of the US.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">9. Is there a subscription for service?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">There are two subscription options: one is a monthly subscription ($8.99) and the other is an annual subscription ($89).</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">10. What tech support is available?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">To start, tech support will be available via phone and email from 8am to 6pm PST. Once we ship in the first quarter of 2016, tech support will be available 24/7/365.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">11. What is the lifespan of the device? Will there be updated models? If so, how often?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">We are building a device that will be improved through software updates, so our goal is not to sell you a new hardware product every year. We expect your CUJO device to last at least a few years before the hardware will need to be replaced. As we learn from our customers, we will release improved hardware versions when necessary, but again, our main focus is to improve the software.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">12. How do I get software updates?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">Software updates are available continuously, without service interruption. The CUJO cloud communicates updates and new threats to the device around the clock – it never takes a break, so your device is always up to date.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">13. Why do I need CUJO?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">We used to have 1 or 2 computers in our homes. Now our home is full of connected devices - from tablets to thermostats - that don't have proper security installed. Virtual criminals are exploiting our networks to steal data, destroy devices, and monitor us at home. This has led to countless incidents that have affected people both virtually and physically. CUJO acts as a shield for your entire home network, adapting continuously to keep you safe.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">14. Do I still need Antivirus software for my PC?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">CUJO does not scan what is on your PC, but rather looks at traffic coming to and leaving from your PC and other devices. Security needs to be multi-layered so it is absolutely important for you to have a good Antivirus software on your desktops and laptops.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">15. Is CUJO going to completely hack-proof my home?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">We see CUJO as a very important, hopefully most important, layer of your Internet security. That said, no single solution could protect you against 100% of attacks. For example, modern Antivirus solutions are said to be effective in less than half of attacks. We believe CUJO will be much more effective because it inspects attacks at the gateway level. However, you should keep your current software security and, most importantly, stay vigilant.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">16. Can CUJO be hacked?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">Any device can be hacked. It is a matter of how much effort and resources one would spend to do it. Being a security company we naturally focus much of our attention to prevent that from happening. We encrypt our connections. And we secured our hardware to be very difficult to penetrate. If it were to happen, criminals would not find much information since we do not store credit card data ourselves and we aggregate only limited packet information in the cloud.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">17. Is CUJO a VPN device?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">A VPN device secures the information you are sending to your destination. It does not keep you safe from criminals penetrating your network. Though we have a VPN feature in our product roadmap, we are focusing on the larger issue of home hacking. We do that in several ways: behavioral analysis of your device payloads, malware and virus scanning DNS, and packet inspection.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">18. I would like more info about privacy. How much of my traffic will my CUJO capture?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">It sees MOST of your traffic. We cannot see encrypted payload from banks, social media, etc. We do collect metadata headers based on deep packet inspection. Raw deep packet inspection NEVER leaves your CUJO device and it is not stored. When the CUJO device publishes the metadata, It is important to know that is encrypted and anonymized.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">19. What do you collect and what do you keep? Do you log? Will you share with 3rd parties? Could you be required to divulge the information?”</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">We collect metadata based on destination IP addresses. We log that the communication of your CUJO device is functioning with our cloud. We will NOT share data with 3rd parties. If legally obliged, we can divulge, but the derived data may not be of much use.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">20. You state that you anonymously analyze our traffic. How is this possible?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">We do see your IP, and is anonymized. Messages come in via push notification on your mobile device.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">21. Our home network consists of two access points, connected to a main switch, which then connects to an ERLite-3. Would the CUJO be connected between the router and main switch, or just directly into the main switch? I saw 2 ethernet ports on the back I though, so I was guessing the former was possible.</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">Plugging the CUJO into the main switch or the router will work.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">22. Where can I learn more about CUJO the company?</div>
<div style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">Please visit our <a href=""//getcujo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #1e7bb9;"">CUJO</a> website to find out more about us. Also, send us an email to hi@getcujo.com.</div>
<div style=""color: #fc4510;padding-bottom:10px;"">23. What are the Risks &amp; Challenges associated with this project?</div>
<div>Our team is well equipped to deliver on our promises and to get you working products in time. We have both the technical expertise and previous experience to execute. With that said, there are several things that we need to overcome to succeed: 1) We need to finish electrical engineering. For that, we hired a company with multiple decades of hardware engineering experience. 2) We need to perfect the software. Our beta products are already equipped for that task, but over the next few months we will have to improve software to support thousands of homes. This is certainly a challenge, but one that we have collective experience to overcome. 3) We rely on 3rd party suppliers to build the CUJO hardware. We've approached the vendor selection very carefully, but some aspects and deliverables will always remain out of our control. Given the experience of our suppliers, we trust that there will be minimal unforeseen issues.</div>

Who Is CUJO For?


 


 

 

That's Why We Built CUJO
To protect your devices from a broad range of attacks, CUJO goes beyond traditional security by using a multilayer approach that combines firewall, antivirus, and malware typically found in separate devices.
 

What CUJO Can Do


 

How We Do It
CUJO acts as a gateway between your devices and for your connection to the Internet. We inspect packets of data coming and leaving your network and block threats before they can reach the target or do damage. We analyze behavior and secure all devices connected to your network. This is critical because newly connected devices don't have pre-installed security.
 
Unlike traditional solutions, CUJO adapts and reacts when your home is attacked and does not rely just on libraries of known malware issues. We analyze a humongous amount of behavioral data in our cloud and push learnings from one home to all CUJO protected homes.





 

Perks: Only on Indiegogo
As a thank you for backing us, we are offering a CUJO device at a price well below what it will retail for later.

19. What do you collect and what do you keep? Do you log? Will you share with 3rd parties? Could you be required to divulge the information?”
We collect metadata based on destination IP addresses. We log that the communication of your CUJO device is functioning with our cloud. We will NOT share data with 3rd parties. If legally obliged, we can divulge, but the derived data may not be of much use.
20. You state that you anonymously analyze our traffic. How is this possible?
We do see your IP, and is anonymized. Messages come in via push notification on your mobile device.
21. Our home network consists of two access points, connected to a main switch, which then connects to an ERLite-3. Would the CUJO be connected between the router and main switch, or just directly into the main switch? I saw 2 ethernet ports on the back I though, so I was guessing the former was possible.
Plugging the CUJO into the main switch or the router will work.
22. Where can I learn more about CUJO the company?
Please visit our CUJO website to find out more about us. Also, send us an email to hi@getcujo.com.
23. What are the Risks & Challenges associated with this project?
Our team is well equipped to deliver on our promises and to get you working products in time. We have both the technical expertise and previous experience to execute. With that said, there are several things that we need to overcome to succeed: 1) We need to finish electrical engineering. For that, we hired a company with multiple decades of hardware engineering experience. 2) We need to perfect the software. Our beta products are already equipped for that task, but over the next few months we will have to improve software to support thousands of homes. This is certainly a challenge, but one that we have collective experience to overcome. 3) We rely on 3rd party suppliers to build the CUJO hardware. We've approached the vendor selection very carefully, but some aspects and deliverables will always remain out of our control. Given the experience of our suppliers, we trust that there will be minimal unforeseen issues.

If our campaign does not reach the target sum, we are going to donate a big part of the reached amount to the Swiss Solidarity foundation, that raises funds for humanitarian relief projects. With the other part we would try to start our business with a tiny selection. 
  Our main idea
 Our main idea is to offer unique clothes with inexpensive prices and to support relief projects at the same moment. 
  Supporting
  We sincerely thank everyone who like to support us and who talks about our campaign using the Indiegogo Tool.  
Kind regards
Your ZURICH INDUSTRIES Team

Deutsch: 

Über uns
ZURICH INDUSTRIES ist ein
 junges Schweizer Modelabel aus Zürich, inspiriert durch Kampfsport und 
Bodybuilding. Sämtliche Designs sind Eigenkreationen, welche durch uns 
kreiert, nachhaltig hergestellt und vertrieben werden. Dabei achten wir 
insbesondere auf einen fairen und ökologischen Herstellungsprozess sowie
 auf die Verwendung hochwertiger Materialien. Mit dem Verkauf jedes 
einzelnen Artikels unterstützen wir zudem humanitäre Hilfsprojekte 
weltweit.

Über unsere Kampagne
Diese Indiegogo Kampagne bietet uns eine einzigartige Möglichkeit Unterstützer für unser Projekt zu finden um die Produktion unserer klassischen T-Shirts, Sweatshirts und Gymbags starten zu können. Des Weiteren hätten wir die Möglichkeit unser Sortiment mit weiteren Produkten wie z.B. Performance Shirts, Accessoires, Sporttaschen und einer grösseren Auswahl an T-Shirts mit neuen Designs zu erweitern. Unseren Unterstützern bieten wir sogar individuell gefertigte Designs.
Sollten wir unser angestrebtes Ziel nicht ereichen, beabsichtigen wir einen Grossteil des erzielten Betrages an die Schweizer Glückskette zu spenden. Den Restbetrag würden wir für die Produktion eines sehr kleinen Teils unseres eigentlichen Sortiments verwenden. 

Was wir bezwecken
Unsere Phylosphie ist es Bekleidung mit einzigartigen Designs zu einem erschwinglichen Preis anzubieten und dabei gleichzeitige Hilfsprojekte auf der ganzen Welt zu unterstützen. 
UnterstützungWir danken jedem herzlich, welcher uns zu unterstützen beabsichtigt und über unser Projekt mittels Indiegogo Tool spricht. Liebe Grüsse

I came from a not very well off single parent family. My mother never remarried and raised my whole family with her own bare hands. In order to make her proud, I worked extremely hard and graduated with a First Class Honors, awarded a British Council Scholarship and interviewed by various international and local

<p>Thanks for taking the time to pop past! We are SheKudo (Amy Iheakanwa and Shetu Simone), a clothing label born out of our love for both our heritages (African and Australian) and the cultures in which we have been raised. We are both students who share a love for fashion and expressing who we are through what we wear.</p>
<p>We at SheKudo saw not only a massive gap in the market for unique clothing pieces at affordable prices, but wanted to create collections which embodied both Western and Eastern elements of fashion. </p>
<p>SheKudo incorporates common African printed fabrics into our contemporary designs, creating - rather than following - fashionable trends. In addition to this we re-create pre-loved denim into wearable pieces with a twist (see our denim bustier and T4 tee, which were both originally 3 pairs of Men’s jeans), and last but not least, we have our quirky 'Naija Tees' T-shirt range.</p>
<p>We are very excited about our project and hope that there are like minded folk out there who believe strongly in having unique, covetable pieces which transcend seasons without burning away your back pocket.</p>
<ul>
<li> </li>
</ul><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Due to being students - we are constantly on struggle street (fellow students, can we hear a grunt of approval) and would immensely appreciate support from those who also believe in our vision.</p>
<p>We recently had our launch in September to release to the world our SS 12/13 Collection entitled ""Wahala"" (see video) and now need at least $20,000 to continue to move forward.</p>
<p>20,000 would assist us in buying fabric, reproducing our current designs, marketing, setting up of our online store and to commence our next collection which is quite behind due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>We have thrown in a number of perks which we believe are great value to say thank you for supporting our plight. Some perks even include non-fashion items such as local artist contributions - as we are big supporters of our local Australian musical talent – (and we also thank them for allowing us to utilise their talents through gifts).</p>
<ul>
<li> </li>
</ul><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The funding and support would mean a great deal to us. Not only will it create a platform for us to expand from but it will also assist us in our growth and exposure for the future.</p>
<p>Once SheKudo is up and running at full steam ahead - we aim to contribute 10% of each online sale to a self-developed fund which will eventually look to employing 3-5 seamstresses in Ghana to assist in the production of our future collections. As our label develops, we will look at increasing this number and hopefully opening up a small scale manufacturing factory there. We believe very strongly in self sustainability and want to use our label as well as what we have learnt through personal experience to bring about change in what ways we can.</p>
<ul>
<li> </li>
</ul><h3>I aint' got no money honey!</h3>
<p>We hope you can believe in our brand as much as we do.</p>
<p>Ain't got no funds?- all gravy baby. Words can be just as effective, so please do spread the word and help us promote via Twitter, Facebook and other forms of social media.</p>

<p>Question the Answer is a jewelry collection turned small business in 2014. I am the owner, designer and maker behind Question the Answer and I am so excited to take this next step in the evolution of my business. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FORM:</h3>
<blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">    I graduated from the University of Memphis with a BFA in Studio Arts in 2010. My thesis addressed materialism and the idea of inanimate desire behind every frivolous purchase within the world of fashion. I chose to depict this idea by painting a luxuriously dressed life-size skeleton with bright colors and sculptural features. </span></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">    About a year later in 2011, I decided to downsize the image into a wooden pendant, beginning my path into jewelry making. For about two years I perfected my design, changing the height and width of the skull and eventually changing the material from scrap wood into maple. Finally in late 2013, I had committed to the most refined version of my original design. It was then that I realized, I wanted to depict this form in metal.</span></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437500780/txr0bxmdc9ezwxydxpdv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 481.5px; height: 321px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">PRODUCING WORK IN METAL:</i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">    Since my degree and  trade had mostly been in painting in two dimensions, I decided to take some continuing education classes in small metals and began to learn to solder and forge. I took three of the classes locally throughout 2013 and 2014, and eventually I had learned most of the basic techniques and started</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> building forms to enhance my hand painted sugar skulls.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437501814/cyd3cunlzqead2tvckzn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 504.5233644859813px; height: 336px;""/></p>

<br/></span><p></p>
<p>    Throughout this process, my designs began to wander away from the sugar skull and my own style as an artist became more polished. I started creating minimal forms that I adored and eventually I produced enough work for two separate collections. </p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span style=""font-style: normal;""><p>    I continued to refine my work while still making the sugar skull pendants my niche customers loved. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">    In March 2015,  I traveled to the CreativeSide Jewelry Academy in Austin, TX in an effort to increase my education in small metals and more specifically, jewelry. There I learned several new settings, including the flush setting, channel setting and a couple of different prong settings. With these new techniques and with the knowledge of my new medium, I have returned to that pivoting and decisive moment. I will cast my sugar skull design in various semiprecious metals and set a flush gemstone into the ""minds eye"" of the design.</span></p>

</div><div>
<p>If I am able to meet my entire goal I will be able to acquire all of these resources to quicken my production process and ensure a quality product. New tools &amp; equipment are critical to the growth of <i>Question the Answer. </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Since I already purchased a </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Neycraft SpinCaster</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> &amp; a </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Neycraft Kiln </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">from an estate sale back in October 2014,</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> my costs will be significantly lower.</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$370 for a GRS BenchMate Stone-Setting Holder &amp; Kit. </span>This<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> makes it much </span>easier<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for me to hold the piece and set a stone without harming the work.</span>
</li>
<li>$500 to build a vent above my kiln. The kiln burns out the wax from the investment mold and to keep my studio ventilated, I'll need to build a vent-a-hood above the kiln.</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$500 for a larger tumbler machine. This machine cleans the pieces before </span>they<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> are ready to ship out, currently I have a VERY small one, these </span>pieces require much more space. </li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$545 for a wax injection machine. This machine allows me to make one mold from rubber and inject wax into it, allowing for a quicker production process and a quality cast every time.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$170 for a slide &amp; lock adjustment bracket. This contraption is built for the BenchMate Stone-Setting Holder and will allow it to be moved to the correct angle and </span>height on my jewelers bench so that I may set stones comfortably and without harming the piece.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$170 for a BenchMate Vise. This vise tilts &amp; rotates on two axes to hold pieces perfectly angled for stone-setting &amp; will solve many holding problems. Remember, jewelry is tiny and hard to hold stable to set a stone into.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$225 for a steam cleaning machine. This machine will clean the pieces effectively so that every piece arrives perfect right to your doorstep.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$1600 for a plating system. This will allow my work to </span>have<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the highest in craftsmanship by coating the finished work in yellow gold or rose gold. This way none of the plating is compromised while sanding and finishing the piece.</span>
</li>
<li>$300 for plating solution. As you might have guessed, even the solutions to plate metals are expensive. I mean it's basically liquid gold.</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$520 for a large cast iron bench </span>anvil &amp; base. Believe it or not, I've been working without one for quite some time.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$200 for Other small production costs for casting like investment &amp; a scale.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$600 for tools such as a cutting tool, a </span>mandrel &amp; flat stock professional pliers. These tools will help my production process immensely &amp; will allow me to work comfortably so that I may produce more pieces in less time.</li>
<li>$2000 for initial inventory material costs. This means the actual metals, the chains they are hung on and findings for the actual pieces.</li>
<li>$750 for product packaging materials including my printed boxes, hang tags for the pieces &amp; shipping supplies.</li>
<li>$500 for other startup expenses including unforeseen construction costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Of course if the unthinkable happens and I'm not able to meet my entire goal, I will reconsider my most necessary needs &amp; assess my options. This may mean changing the quality of metals I will cast in, to lower my material costs. This action would only be made in the most extreme conditions as I am very committed to the design and the product details.</p>

<div>Because of crowdfunding, I have this creative opportunity without enduring the limits of a financial risk. This allows me to present a product to my established community and introduce my business to a larger audience while growing my brand. </div>
</div><div>Craftsmanship is extremely valuable to <i>Question the Answer</i>. Because of this, I would like to have as much time as possible to perfect my pendants and ensure their quality. These pendants will involve techniques that are brand new to me so they may require more time for testing than originally promised, which potentially could postpone the delivery date of your piece. If this occurs, you will be notified and guaranteed that when your handmade piece arrives it will certainly be worth the wait.</div><div>I assure you that I am able to overcome the hurdles related to this challenge. I have already changed mediums and built this business while doing so; I am confident that I will work through these potential problems to find the best solution. </div><div><br/></div><div>

</div></div>","Question the Answer is a jewelry collection turned small business in 2014. I am the owner, designer and maker behind Question the Answer and I am so excited to take this next step in the evolution of my business. 

BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FORM:
    I graduated from the University of Memphis with a BFA in Studio Arts in 2010. My thesis addressed materialism and the idea of inanimate desire behind every frivolous purchase within the world of fashion. I chose to depict this idea by painting a luxuriously dressed life-size skeleton with bright colors and sculptural features. 
    About a year later in 2011, I decided to downsize the image into a wooden pendant, beginning my path into jewelry making. For about two years I perfected my design, changing the height and width of the skull and eventually changing the material from scrap wood into maple. Finally in late 2013, I had committed to the most refined version of my original design. It was then that I realized, I wanted to depict this form in metal.
    

PRODUCING WORK IN METAL:
    Since my degree and  trade had mostly been in painting in two dimensions, I decided to take some continuing education classes in small metals and began to learn to solder and forge. I took three of the classes locally throughout 2013 and 2014, and eventually I had learned most of the basic techniques and started building forms to enhance my hand painted sugar skulls.

 

 \

    Throughout this process, my designs began to wander away from the sugar skull and my own style as an artist became more polished. I started creating minimal forms that I adored and eventually I produced enough work for two separate collections. 
   
  

    I continued to refine my work while still making the sugar skull pendants my niche customers loved. 
    In March 2015,  I traveled to the CreativeSide Jewelry Academy in Austin, TX in an effort to increase my education in small metals and more specifically, jewelry. There I learned several new settings, including the flush setting, channel setting and a couple of different prong settings. With these new techniques and with the knowledge of my new medium, I have returned to that pivoting and decisive moment. I will cast my sugar skull design in various semiprecious metals and set a flush gemstone into the ""minds eye"" of the design.


  



WHAT I NEED & WHAT YOU GET:


If I am able to meet my entire goal I will be able to acquire all of these resources to quicken my production process and ensure a quality product. New tools & equipment are critical to the growth of Question the Answer. Since I already purchased a Neycraft SpinCaster & a Neycraft Kiln from an estate sale back in October 2014,  my costs will be significantly lower.



$370 for a GRS BenchMate Stone-Setting Holder & Kit. This makes it much easier for me to hold the piece and set a stone without harming the work.

$500 to build a vent above my kiln. The kiln burns out the wax from the investment mold and to keep my studio ventilated, I'll need to build a vent-a-hood above the kiln.

$500 for a larger tumbler machine. This machine cleans the pieces before they are ready to ship out, currently I have a VERY small one, these pieces require much more space. 
$545 for a wax injection machine. This machine allows me to make one mold from rubber and inject wax into it, allowing for a quicker production process and a quality cast every time.

$170 for a slide & lock adjustment bracket. This contraption is built for the BenchMate Stone-Setting Holder and will allow it to be moved to the correct angle and height on my jewelers bench so that I may set stones comfortably and without harming the piece.
$170 for a BenchMate Vise. This vise tilts & rotates on two axes to hold pieces perfectly angled for stone-setting & will solve many holding problems. Remember, jewelry is tiny and hard to hold stable to set a stone into.
$225 for a steam cleaning machine. This machine will clean the pieces effectively so that every piece arrives perfect right to your doorstep.

$1600 for a plating system. This will allow my work to have the highest in craftsmanship by coating the finished work in yellow gold or rose gold. This way none of the plating is compromised while sanding and finishing the piece.

$300 for plating solution. As you might have guessed, even the solutions to plate metals are expensive. I mean it's basically liquid gold.

$520 for a large cast iron bench anvil & base. Believe it or not, I've been working without one for quite some time.
$200 for Other small production costs for casting like investment & a scale.

$600 for tools such as a cutting tool, a mandrel & flat stock professional pliers. These tools will help my production process immensely & will allow me to work comfortably so that I may produce more pieces in less time.
$2000 for initial inventory material costs. This means the actual metals, the chains they are hung on and findings for the actual pieces.
$750 for product packaging materials including my printed boxes, hang tags for the pieces & shipping supplies.
$500 for other startup expenses including unforeseen construction costs.


Of course if the unthinkable happens and I'm not able to meet my entire goal, I will reconsider my most necessary needs & assess my options. This may mean changing the quality of metals I will cast in, to lower my material costs. This action would only be made in the most extreme conditions as I am very committed to the design and the product details.

If you're curious how I will be spending my time until you receive your piece, here's a timeline...

RISKS & CHALLENGES:

Because of crowdfunding, I have this creative opportunity without enduring the limits of a financial risk. This allows me to present a product to my established community and introduce my business to a larger audience while growing my brand. 
Craftsmanship is extremely valuable to Question the Answer. Because of this, I would like to have as much time as possible to perfect my pendants and ensure their quality. These pendants will involve techniques that are brand new to me so they may require more time for testing than originally promised, which potentially could postpone the delivery date of your piece. If this occurs, you will be notified and guaranteed that when your handmade piece arrives it will certainly be worth the wait.I assure you that I am able to overcome the hurdles related to this challenge. I have already changed mediums and built this business while doing so; I am confident that I will work through these potential problems to find the best solution.

<div><span>Unless you've lived under a rock these past few years, you would have noticed that the economic and political world are under a so called ''crisis'': Banks, medias, politicans... they all tell us how we should live our lives, how and what we should think about and the way we need to get things done... but banks, medias and politics are linked by something we're not supposed to know.</span></div>
<div>Secret societies rule our human world and many of us don't know squat about this.

Masonery loves to speak about their great ""benevolent"" members like Washington, but did you know that people like Albert Pike (founder of the K.K.K.) and the satanist Aleister Crowley were grandmasters of Freemasonery? Not that bright, huh? </div>

<p>The beauty industry is a magical and powerful place for creative, artistic, and innovative producers. We chose to delve into this world because we are passionate about enriching the lives of those around us through beauty and lifestyle tools and products. We love helping those around us look beautiful, but more importantly, feel beautiful. One's aura that radiates with inner beauty and confidence is unmistakable. We have simply designed an innovative and specially crafted tool that will enhance such beauty.<br/><br/>

As anyone can affirm, the way our hair looks says a lot about us and is one of the first things people will notice. Having a great hair day seems to have a proportionate effect on how we carry ourselves through the rest of the day. Here at HD Professional, we want everyone to be able to experience great hair days, everyday. With our new Hybrid Styler, beautifully coiffed hair is attainable and with such ease!
Psychologists have been studying and reporting on the effects hair has on a person and their attitude about themselves and how they carry themselves throughout their day. Dr. Diller explains it beautifully in her article, click here to view it

</p>
<p><img align=""left"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275487/files/20131223033402-hd_professional.png?1387798442"" src="""" style=""margin-right: 20px;""/>
In November of this year, we considered very seriously the option of doing a crowdfunding campaign. We thought it would be really great to see what people thought of our business, our product, and whether people were genuinely going to be interested in the thousands of hours we invested in order to bring this product to  reality. We also felt that the crowdfunding space would be an ideal place for us to get our potential market's feedback on our upcoming products and some really</p>
<p>cool ideas that we have to forge into real products. So, we are here now! We are crowdfunding our amazing Hybrid Styler and offering this level of product quality at an amazing price. This a great product for yourself, your wife, your fiancée, your loved one, or for any of your friends.</p>
<p>
So, that's all! We are here to build great lifestyle and hair and esthetic products for consumers and professionals around the world. We are an incredibly strong team of people who decided to quit our day jobs to get this company going. Our academic backgrounds are in Economics, Finance, Marketing, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Fashion, and we even have cosmetologists on staff. We have a PhD. in Physics, another PhD in economics, and just a great team overall with a lot of experience looking to make a difference in our community and to give back to those in need. Through building a strong company anchored in philanthropic efforts!</p>

</h2>
<p><span style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""237"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/g8cbLAY6E8c?rel=0"" width=""285""></iframe></div>When we set out to create a great hair-styling tool people to use when they style their hair, we were shocked by the products available on the market. What we saw were cheaply made products, with limited features, that were selling in stores and online for ridiculously inflated prices.

We then started to examine the market. We researched where these products were manufactured and actually contacted their manufacturers, all of which are in China.
We found out that these companies are producing these low cost products anywhere from $6 to $8 and selling them to consumers at prices ranging from $140 to $220. The women on our team had also made purchases of these competing products. They too were quite unhappy with the price they paid for the performance the tool delivered. Unfortunately, that is all that is out there.<p></p>
<p>
We set out on a mission. We did not want to create another mediocre product with standard functions and we did not want a bunch of buttons and useless LCD displays on our tool. We wanted precision, the highest temperature available, and we wanted a very sleek user control interface. Something that was ""old school"" in the best way. We wanted to also have something look and feel soft and light, was  not cumbersome, and protected our user's fingers from heat and burns. We wanted to produce a device that really optimized the heat effect of releasing ions. So, we did it.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275492/files/20131223033713-hd_hybird2.png?1387798633"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 15px;""/>Nine and a half months later, we have our Hybrid Styler! It's a power-apcked tool, designed and engineered together with our manufacturer, both here in California and in South Korea. South Korean producers are known throughout the world for being meticulous in manufacturing. They produce incredibly high quality products. Yes, our production costs are a lot higher than China but our quality is untouchable and we leave our competitors in the dust with our performance.</p>
<p>
We do not believe that anyone should charge the amounts they are charging for these tools, so we wanted to make our $200 iron affordable for everyone. Actually, even at $200, our iron outperforms our competitors products in the same category. We put a lot of thought into this device.</p>
<p>
Our Hybrid Styler is a mix of analog and digital technologies. We wanted the ease and stability of an analog control interface; something that is easy to turn the device on and off and easy to dial in the exact temperature by simply spinning a traditional control knob.
The brain on the inside of our tool is purely digital. It takes the analog control references and turns it into digital signals performing at digital speeds, thus providing features in safety, temperature calibration and real-time-all-time temperature monitoring. This ensures the device is always at the prescribed temperature with incredibly rapid heating of the plates, and rapid cooling once temperature is lowered. The system provides much less power consumption, and even has a safety and auto shutdown after 45 minutes of non-use. All of this can only be achieved with digital smarts.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275494/files/20131223033937-hd_hybird3.png?1387798777"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p>
<br/><p>So, this is what we have created! Analog controls and functions, and a true digital brain providing digital performance. Through our combined efforts, the Hybrid Styler was born. An amazing tool packed with current and future technology! Give one a try, contribute to our campaign. We know you will love this tool and use it for years to come!

<h2 style=""width: 100%;"">Why Hybrid? <a href=""#back_top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""margin-left: 20px; display: inline-block; float: right;"">Go To Top</a>
</h2>
<p>
        Hybrid is a new way of binding old analog technology together with digital technology and making them work efficiently and effectively together. For our Hybrid Styler, we wanted to have the ease of use of traditional knobs and dials, simple, quick controls, and we wanted to put those simple accurate controls into a digital system that would provide great performance and low power consumption.</p>
<p>
    Hybrid; what does it mean? For purposes of our product, it can be defined in two ways. A hybrid technology (computer) is a system that exhibits features of an analog system and a digital system. Wiki defines it here:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_computer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #33b6c4;"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_computer</a> . For our other purpose, and from an integrated circuit (the brain inside the Hybrid Styler) a hybrid integrated circuit is a miniaturized electronic circuit combining different semiconductor devices and passive components on a substrate. More information can be found here:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_integrated_circuit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #33b6c4;"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_integrated_circuit</a> .
    </p>
<p>
    So why hybrid? Because we felt that providing analog control of a tool like ours and pairing it with the performance of a digital system is not only an amazing combination, but our users will love the reliability and amazing performance that this product will provide. Try for yourself and let us know how you feel. One of our main reasons for being on Indiegogo with our campaign is to elicit user feedback. Tell us what you think of this product and the idea. Shoot us an email if you have any comments or suggestions on how we can improve our concept and design. <a href=""mailto:info@hdprofessionalhair.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #33b6c4;"" title=""info@hdprofessionalhair.com"">info@hdprofessionalhair.com</a>

We will use most of the funds to purchase our first round of inventory, this inventory will be used to support our campaign contributors and give us enough inventory to really start to move the company forward. Proceeds from the sales of the remainder of our inventory will allow us to give back to our community and to some really great charities totaling about $40,000.

      Well, this is a great question. We have already started working on the next amazing product. This product is going to use advanced aerospace engineering and the technology behind the jet engine and high bypass thrust to create the ultimate hair drying tool (We will probably crowdfund this project as well as just the science behind this tool is going to consume a lot of resource and cost a little bit.) We have started working with a major aerospace university to source engineers to help us develop this new product. It is going to be amazing, keep your eyes and ears open for upcoming announcements.</p>
<p>
We are also coming out with a very cool retro dryer that will easily fit in any small bag and deliver a great big punch! The power of a full sized drying tool in a small retro package. We should announce more on this in mid January.</p>

Our love of beauty Go To Top

The beauty industry is a magical and powerful place for creative, artistic, and innovative producers. We chose to delve into this world because we are passionate about enriching the lives of those around us through beauty and lifestyle tools and products. We love helping those around us look beautiful, but more importantly, feel beautiful. One's aura that radiates with inner beauty and confidence is unmistakable. We have simply designed an innovative and specially crafted tool that will enhance such beauty.

As anyone can affirm, the way our hair looks says a lot about us and is one of the first things people will notice. Having a great hair day seems to have a proportionate effect on how we carry ourselves through the rest of the day. Here at HD Professional, we want everyone to be able to experience great hair days, everyday. With our new Hybrid Styler, beautifully coiffed hair is attainable and with such ease!
Psychologists have been studying and reporting on the effects hair has on a person and their attitude about themselves and how they carry themselves throughout their day. Dr. Diller explains it beautifully in her article, click here to view it 



The Psychology Behind A 'Good Hair Day'
www.huffingtonpost.com
Are you having ""a good hair day""? Seems like a simple, even silly, question coming from a psychologist whose work is about getting underneath the surface. But in all honesty -- superficial or not -- I have to say I'm familiar with that feeling.

 
    So what if we could give everyone a tool to make their attitude about their life change for the better? Give them a tool that would help them look beautiful, make them feel great, give them that high definition hair? Waves, curls, straight, however they want to style their hair, whatever look they are going for, we give them the tool to make that happen. That is what we are all about at HD Professional. We make tools that make people look and feel beautiful!

In November of this year, we considered very seriously the option of doing a crowdfunding campaign. We thought it would be really great to see what people thought of our business, our product, and whether people were genuinely going to be interested in the thousands of hours we invested in order to bring this product to  reality. We also felt that the crowdfunding space would be an ideal place for us to get our potential market's feedback on our upcoming products and some really
cool ideas that we have to forge into real products. So, we are here now! We are crowdfunding our amazing Hybrid Styler and offering this level of product quality at an amazing price. This a great product for yourself, your wife, your fiancée, your loved one, or for any of your friends.

So, that's all! We are here to build great lifestyle and hair and esthetic products for consumers and professionals around the world. We are an incredibly strong team of people who decided to quit our day jobs to get this company going. Our academic backgrounds are in Economics, Finance, Marketing, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Fashion, and we even have cosmetologists on staff. We have a PhD. in Physics, another PhD in economics, and just a great team overall with a lot of experience looking to make a difference in our community and to give back to those in need. Through building a strong company anchored in philanthropic efforts!

Join us, give our product a try, help us build our business, and help us make a difference in our little world called Earth! Again, welcome to HD Professional. May goddess-like looks be with you!





What is the HD Hybrid Styler? Go To Top

When we set out to create a great hair-styling tool people to use when they style their hair, we were shocked by the products available on the market. What we saw were cheaply made products, with limited features, that were selling in stores and online for ridiculously inflated prices.

We then started to examine the market. We researched where these products were manufactured and actually contacted their manufacturers, all of which are in China.
We found out that these companies are producing these low cost products anywhere from $6 to $8 and selling them to consumers at prices ranging from $140 to $220. The women on our team had also made purchases of these competing products. They too were quite unhappy with the price they paid for the performance the tool delivered. Unfortunately, that is all that is out there.

We set out on a mission. We did not want to create another mediocre product with standard functions and we did not want a bunch of buttons and useless LCD displays on our tool. We wanted precision, the highest temperature available, and we wanted a very sleek user control interface. Something that was ""old school"" in the best way. We wanted to also have something look and feel soft and light, was  not cumbersome, and protected our user's fingers from heat and burns. We wanted to produce a device that really optimized the heat effect of releasing ions. So, we did it.
Nine and a half months later, we have our Hybrid Styler! It's a power-apcked tool, designed and engineered together with our manufacturer, both here in California and in South Korea. South Korean producers are known throughout the world for being meticulous in manufacturing. They produce incredibly high quality products. Yes, our production costs are a lot higher than China but our quality is untouchable and we leave our competitors in the dust with our performance.

We do not believe that anyone should charge the amounts they are charging for these tools, so we wanted to make our $200 iron affordable for everyone. Actually, even at $200, our iron outperforms our competitors products in the same category. We put a lot of thought into this device.

Our Hybrid Styler is a mix of analog and digital technologies. We wanted the ease and stability of an analog control interface; something that is easy to turn the device on and off and easy to dial in the exact temperature by simply spinning a traditional control knob.
The brain on the inside of our tool is purely digital. It takes the analog control references and turns it into digital signals performing at digital speeds, thus providing features in safety, temperature calibration and real-time-all-time temperature monitoring. This ensures the device is always at the prescribed temperature with incredibly rapid heating of the plates, and rapid cooling once temperature is lowered. The system provides much less power consumption, and even has a safety and auto shutdown after 45 minutes of non-use. All of this can only be achieved with digital smarts.

So, this is what we have created! Analog controls and functions, and a true digital brain providing digital performance. Through our combined efforts, the Hybrid Styler was born. An amazing tool packed with current and future technology! Give one a try, contribute to our campaign. We know you will love this tool and use it for years to come!






Why Hybrid? Go To Top


        Hybrid is a new way of binding old analog technology together with digital technology and making them work efficiently and effectively together. For our Hybrid Styler, we wanted to have the ease of use of traditional knobs and dials, simple, quick controls, and we wanted to put those simple accurate controls into a digital system that would provide great performance and low power consumption.

    Hybrid; what does it mean? For purposes of our product, it can be defined in two ways. A hybrid technology (computer) is a system that exhibits features of an analog system and a digital system. Wiki defines it here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_computer . For our other purpose, and from an integrated circuit (the brain inside the Hybrid Styler) a hybrid integrated circuit is a miniaturized electronic circuit combining different semiconductor devices and passive components on a substrate. More information can be found here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_integrated_circuit .
    

    So why hybrid? Because we felt that providing analog control of a tool like ours and pairing it with the performance of a digital system is not only an amazing combination, but our users will love the reliability and amazing performance that this product will provide. Try for yourself and let us know how you feel. One of our main reasons for being on Indiegogo with our campaign is to elicit user feedback. Tell us what you think of this product and the idea. Shoot us an email if you have any comments or suggestions on how we can improve our concept and design. info@hdprofessionalhair.com





Why Crowdfunding? Go To Top

Besides the fact that it is an awesome way to introduce a business or a concept, meet new friends, and build a better economy together, crowdfunding gives us access to the many thousands of beautiful people like you.

We want to be a part of reducing unemployment through hiring and be active in our community through giving time and money from revenues.

It is an honor and a pleasure to be part of this community and to have the ability to create a campaign to share our hard work and the product we are so proud of. We are a manufacturer of these high end beauty tools and have been working to bring a new kind of device to the market. We wanted a set of products that were more consumer friendly, more price appropriate, and of quality that is unexpected i the market.

Every one of our crowdfunding contributors has an opportunity to come onboard and become a beta tester and product idea advisor to our company.

How will the funds from our campaign be used?  We will use most of the funds to purchase our first round of inventory, this inventory will be used to support our campaign contributors and give us enough inventory to really start to move the company forward. Proceeds from the sales of the remainder of our inventory will allow us to give back to our community and to some really great charities totaling about $40,000. Your contributions will also help us put together our customer support team and help us really learn what we need to do for our next project.


We need your help. We need your feedback. We need you to try our product, tell us what you think, tell us what you feel should be improved, and help us shape the ideas for our next set of products.

We are also coming out with a very cool retro dryer that will easily fit in any small bag and deliver a great big punch! The power of a full sized drying tool in a small retro package. We should announce more on this in mid January.

Clips, accessories and other tools will be introduced throughout the first quarter of 2014. We will be very busy so we really need your help now! Help us get this show on the road and contribute to our campaign today. Thank you so much for reading our campaign page.





Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Go To Top


OK, so I changed my mind. Is there a way to get a refund?
Unfortunately there is no way to do that. It is not because we do not want to give you a refund, it is just Indiegogo's policy. We don't have any way to get around that as they control the way contributions flow into Indiegogo and out of Indiegogo. For more information on their policies you can see Indiegogo's rules for crowdfunding here.Indiegogo's rules for crowdfunding here.

Can I get multiple perks or only one?
Of course you can get multiple perks. The more perks we give you the happier we are! We have made our perks offering really stupendous. If you have any suggestions on improvements, please let us know. Also, don't forget about the referral perks. They are awesome!

Can I contribute feedback on the product or any upcoming product?
Of course you can. We would love your feedback as much as we would love for you to contribute. Please, let us know how you feel. Shoot off an email to info@hdprofessionalhair.com  with your input.

What is the warranty on the HD Styler?
We offer a standard limited one (1) year warranty on our product however, Indiegogo contributors and perk winners will get an added year of warranty making the total warranty two years. Pay for your contribution with your American Express card and we believe you can get a third year of warranty from Amex. Be sure to check with them though as we cannot guarantee this.

Will you ship international?
Definitely. Just remember, our product is 110V AC and has an Edison plug. Check to make sure your country supports that type of voltage and plug. Also, we will ship your product with a commercial invoice showing the price of $89 or $99 depending on which level you purchase at. We cannot change that value. Duties and taxes are up to you to handle.",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

Here you invest in a better environmentWe dont need banks we need people .....join this venture. Together we can make this come true. You get a discount and we get started, fair for all and the environment is the winner.You will get a refrigerator which has low energy consumption and long-lasting.StayCoolFridge will use less than other refrigerators , but the most important theme is the total amount of energy that is used to make the refrigerator. At the same time, it is extremely important to measure the energy to be used to obtain the product when it can not be used anymore. LIFETIMECYCLES (consumption of energy)This refrigerator is made of bioplastic and the insulation is made of plastic Airmats too. Instead of alminum/steel frame/body we use Plastic. It makes perfect sense environmentally....REUSE and REDUSE......I have developed several children’s
     products like www.flexibath.com and www.fredachair.com all done with respect for the enviorment.
More roomThin insulation gives you more space inside even if you make a ""build-in solution""Ice machine is best next to the refrigerator, it is also better in terms of energy consumption and hygienically.Customized refrigeratorHow cool........Makes no sense to...to break down or burn old of refrigerators, a waste of time and effort.IT IS STUCK - LIKE GLUE?NEW - Special insulation
We will put special plastic
material like a mat into the refrigerator instead of PU-foam.This insulation material is developed by one of the biggest US-plastic developer and we hope to use the matts in other products too.It will give a lower consumption and be 100% reusable. NO pollution, just clean technique and RENEWABLE !! It even have a better insulation property. (this is not final insulation,just stock photo)                                                                 

Good bargain tooEven with all these new possibilities, the refrigerator is not the most expensive on the market. We are aiming for a FOB price of 1000 - 1699 $ and we would love to be a good bargain and get even lower.Estimated Price ; 1000 - 1699$ We hope cheeper than many other brands, but this depends on the funding.... Please help us....!This fridge last a long time and it can be repaired by the local handyman.Standard size.188 cm. x 60 cm. x 58 cm.  3 nice doors to keep most cold air inside the cabinet when it is opened.Great Design - choose your colour - Nice LED light inside. SUPER SAVER


Different cool zones -  One for meat and some for happy fruit and vegetables.Wine and Water has its own special space at the bottom of the refrigerator where it is most cool and proper temperature for these products.Medications and makeup have their own trays that can be closed securely so that children do not get into contact with these products.You can get customized drawers too.""Pull-easy"" draws - gives you quick overviewChoose your grip and door color.Get a grip........!Nice easy display to show temperature (stock photo)We can make it happen !we have done it before with www.flexibath.com. Starting out with nothing and people just thinking ""you must be crazy""..... but after a lot of work and finding the money it was done. The FlexiBath is sold in more than 40 countries. No Bank but PeopleIf you like us to put this fridge into the market, we can do it together, but we need the money to get it done. You get the discount and pay like a ""preorder"" then we end up ""homesafe""Some big companies in the ""refrigerator industry"" see the opportunities in this new product They have evaluated the project, but rejected because they don't want to change the ""PU-foam  sandwich "" method, even they know about the consequenses using that kind of insulation. WE can put an end to that, just by introducing this first fridge in the market without the foam.Final designWhen we start the final drawings towards the tooling, we may change some of the design, but only if we need to. We hope the customer can choose , different grips, feet and door colors. The inside drawers can be  customizedtoo, but all these details will be noted on the months update paged.www.staycoolfridge.comHere is some of the earlier drawings of the "" Stay Cool Fridge""New and innovative insulation....safe and renewable.Long time to developWe started out trying to do a wooden frame. Now it is plastic. Plastic is more    hygienic and economic reasonable, so we changed to renewable PP-plastic.Let´s make it a better world, let´s make it possible to recyclable the refrigerators......here is the solution.In a small country like Denmark we burn of 220.000 old refrigerators yearly, nothing get´s reused, just burned (the liquid is reused only)?Just a wasteGet a Grip !!Cool renewable grip.....When the refrigerator is finished, we will make a freezer-cabinet similar to this design and again with this new insulation, then you have a total central cool unit in your kitchen, right......!",40.0,4,"1 Campaign

But as soon as you went into the store and found out about the price, you just felt like hell no? We feel you, however Guivre Homme wants to make a difference. </i></p><p>We are a team of three people (17, 18 and 22 years old) who want to found a fashion business called Guivre Homme, for fashion has always been our passion. As a start of our own fashion brand, we want to manufacture high quality pairs of shoes at a fair price. We spend a lot of time designing three pairs in total. Our design is simple and classic. We strongly associate our brand with nature. That's why our shoes are produced climate friendly and we only use high quality materials such as genuine leather. In addition all the shoes are handmade.</p><p>We searched month for the perfect factory which is able to produce the shoes in a high quality and to manufacture the right quantity.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Max. Over the past year I have been developing a way to coat a pair of Dr. Dre Beats headphones in Gold. I have recently found the perfect way of doing this. The result is an amazing pair of headphones!</p>
<p>I have used Beats Pro headphones. <span>Beats Pro headphones are designed for sound engineers, musicians, and those who take sound seriously. They’re the headphones that artists like Will.i.am use in the studio, and are designed to deliver the same level of emotion and power the artist originally intended. And now you can have these state of the art headphones coated in 24-Carat gold.</span></p>
<h3 class=""content-collapse"">Headphone Features</h3>
<h4>THE SOUND OF THE STUDIO.</h4>
<p>Beats Pro professional headphones sound so good because they put back the quality lost in modern-day file compression. That means you’re really hearing music the way it was originally heard by the artist in the studio.</p>
<h4>CLEAR HIGHS AND DEEP LOWS.</h4>
<p>Beats Pro are made of steel and aluminum, giving you an interior sound platform more solid than most. That’s why you’ll feel the kind of bass that resonates deep in your chest when you play your music.</p>
<h4>PRACTICALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE.</h4>
<p>No cheap plastic, no frayed cords. Beats Pro headphones are made with an aluminum gunmetal frame, encasing overstuffed leather ear cups.</p>
<h4>TRUE NOISE REDUCTION.</h4>
<p>Because Beats Pro headphones have heavily padded, pivoting ear cups, you get the noise cancelling effect without the need for power switches or batteries. It’s the real studio monitor experience in a headphone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now we have the method and we have the equipment, all we need is your help to start producing large quantities of these headphones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What will you get in return...?</p>
<p>For $300 you will recieve the special pair of headphones. Not only is this over 50% off the production cost, but this is cheaper that buying the normal headphones themselves that retail for $399! (<a href=""http://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/pro/beats-pro.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/pro/beats-pro.html</a>)</p>
<p>For $450 you will be able to customise the headphones and engrave whatever you desire on them.</p>
<p>If you are feeling generous and want to donate $1500, you can have these line of head phones named after you or anything you choose!</p>

<p></p>
<p>My personal quest to evolve pockets began years ago. I was commuting a lot for work – to a job I did not love – and was carrying all of the gadgets that I had to bring with me. I tried backpacks, computer bags, fanny packs… every variation of what could be considered a man-purse you could imagine.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434577407/lidkuxee2u6djsgyepq2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Not my best look.</p>
<p>One day, while on a hike with my wife, she expressed very succinctly that she was tired of carrying my crap when we went out, and that I needed to find a better solution.</p>
<p>I looked into fishing vests, and while all those exterior pockets may have had the capacity, they were no better looking than a fanny pack, and none of those pockets were designed to hold the devices I wanted to carry.</p>
<p>With no clothing design background, I grabbed a pair of scissors, some scrap fabric, and a stapler.  I cobbled together a super rough prototype of my first pocket product: a vest.  I took a chance, quit my job, and formed a company – SCOTTeVEST – to produce and sell these pocket-filled vests.</p>
<p>In the 15 years since producing my first prototype, the devices have totally changed but my commitment remains the same: to produce high-quality, good-looking clothing with tons of hidden pockets.</p>
<p>Wearing SCOTTeVEST will change the way you look at clothing.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
</div><p><span>Clothing changes… Technology changes… Our products change… But one thing that has not changed very much is the business model of creating and selling clothing.</span></p><p><span><span>Our Indiegogo campaign is not just about raising some cash to put a new product on the market.  We want to take the same type of radical thinking that we apply to the pockets in our products, and evolve the way clothing is ordered, produced, and sold.</span></span></p><p>We’ve been changing the clothing industry since our first product:</p><ol>
<li><p>We were the first clothing brand started online (in 2000) and set up exclusively to sell direct to the consumer.  Our first product was actually sold on a pre-order model, very much like Indiegogo today!</p></li>
<li><p>One of our guiding design principles in non-obsolescence, which is a fancy way of saying that our clothing doesn’t go out of fashion.  This allows us to order in larger quantities and sell the same style for several years.  No one else does this… but it’s not without its risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, I want to change the game again, reduce my inventory risk and pass those savings directly on to YOU.</p></li>
</ol><p>I’m not a big gambler.  Nickel slots and low-stakes poker are about all I can stomach most of the time.  Unfortunately, the traditional clothing company model is set up as a gamble.</p><p>Right now, any clothing company – whether they are massive or tiny – will come up with a design a full year in advance, produce a whole bunch of them, and hope that they sell.  </p><p>If they do sell, great. Hopefully that success will help them break even for all the other styles that did not perform nearly as well.  </p><p>Our first two innovations in the industry - selling online and creating timeless designs - have allowed us to succeed in spite of these gambles, but we still need to buy and stock huge quantities of clothing.  That’s a big risk, and a huge expense.</p><p>This risk is why some clothing brands charge outrageous prices, and then you see them a few months later in discount stores for 75% to 90% off their original price.  Once “the season” is over, they know they won’t get any more money from all their stock, so they can only get rid of it at steep discounts.  It kind of sucks for everyone... and there has to be a better way.</p><p>I believe that shifting to a Clothing On Demand model is the solution the clothing industry needs.  When I first ran a pre-order sale, I was able to mitigate some of my risk, and that success allowed me to build upon my first product and continue to grow.  I am trying to do exactly the same thing with this Indiegogo campaign today.</p><p><span><span>To evolve with the times, the clothing industry will need to shift to be more “on demand.”  Through this campaign on Indiegogo, I want to test a Clothing On Demand system, where companies like mine have a mechanism to know how much of a product they should create before it is created.</span></span></p><p>By lowering the financial risk to clothing manufacturers like me, you will pay the absolute best price possible.  Manufacturers like me don't need to wonder if there is going to be $2 million worth of inventory sitting in a warehouse for a couple years that no one wants.</p>Bottom line: everyone wins, and this Indiegogo campaign is the first step in my experiment to see if clothing on demand is a viable model for my company and industry.<p></p><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>What are the risks of supporting this campaign?</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Essentially… none.</span></p>

<p>If you look at any product on our site, you’ll see tons of amazing reviews.</p>
<p>And if you’re still not convinced that we are legit, just Google SCOTTeVEST and see for yourself.</p>
<p>Creating clothing as complex as mine is a completely different process from making an average piece of clothing. When we create a product design, it is about 50 pages long and contains details and specifications that you might expect to see on blueprints for a high-rise building, not a jacket.  </p>

<p>""There’s more design thought in Scott’s clothing than most smart phones.” - Guy Kawasaki, Chief Evangelist at Canva</p>
<p>Through a process that takes months of back-and-forth with our factories, we work through each minute detail in a process of prototyping that requires multiple iterations and long hours of detailed explanations.</p>
<p><span><span>For the Ultimate Pocket Fleece, we have already gone through that entire process… The prototype is our final proof, and the next step is to place an order and kick off production.  At this point, it's not a question of if, but when, so there is really no risk that we won’t deliver on our promises.</span></span></p>
<p>We are working with a factory that we have used on dozens of garments before, and their work is top-notch.</p>
<p></p>
<span><span>The only potential delivery risk would be a delay in shipping, which could hold things up for at most a week.  We have a hold on all materials required for our initial run, and have access to additional materials for follow-up orders.</span></span>

If you want to really appreciate the quality and level of careful design that goes into this product, you should know why I created it in the first place.   Why 19 Pockets? While most fashion designers are concerned with things like hemlines and draping, we consider ourselves to be function designers first and foremost.
Yes, the outside matters, but the structure of the pockets, the way they improve your life, and the way they make carrying and accessing your technology easier are our first focuses.

My personal quest to evolve pockets began years ago. I was commuting a lot for work – to a job I did not love – and was carrying all of the gadgets that I had to bring with me. I tried backpacks, computer bags, fanny packs… every variation of what could be considered a man-purse you could imagine.


Not my best look.
One day, while on a hike with my wife, she expressed very succinctly that she was tired of carrying my crap when we went out, and that I needed to find a better solution.
I looked into fishing vests, and while all those exterior pockets may have had the capacity, they were no better looking than a fanny pack, and none of those pockets were designed to hold the devices I wanted to carry.
With no clothing design background, I grabbed a pair of scissors, some scrap fabric, and a stapler.  I cobbled together a super rough prototype of my first pocket product: a vest.  I took a chance, quit my job, and formed a company – SCOTTeVEST – to produce and sell these pocket-filled vests.
In the 15 years since producing my first prototype, the devices have totally changed but my commitment remains the same: to produce high-quality, good-looking clothing with tons of hidden pockets.
Wearing SCOTTeVEST will change the way you look at clothing.



Why are we on IGG?
 
Clothing changes… Technology changes… Our products change… But one thing that has not changed very much is the business model of creating and selling clothing.Our Indiegogo campaign is not just about raising some cash to put a new product on the market.  We want to take the same type of radical thinking that we apply to the pockets in our products, and evolve the way clothing is ordered, produced, and sold.We’ve been changing the clothing industry since our first product:
We were the first clothing brand started online (in 2000) and set up exclusively to sell direct to the consumer.  Our first product was actually sold on a pre-order model, very much like Indiegogo today!
One of our guiding design principles in non-obsolescence, which is a fancy way of saying that our clothing doesn’t go out of fashion.  This allows us to order in larger quantities and sell the same style for several years.  No one else does this… but it’s not without its risks.
Now, I want to change the game again, reduce my inventory risk and pass those savings directly on to YOU.
I’m not a big gambler.  Nickel slots and low-stakes poker are about all I can stomach most of the time.  Unfortunately, the traditional clothing company model is set up as a gamble.Right now, any clothing company – whether they are massive or tiny – will come up with a design a full year in advance, produce a whole bunch of them, and hope that they sell.  If they do sell, great. Hopefully that success will help them break even for all the other styles that did not perform nearly as well.  Our first two innovations in the industry - selling online and creating timeless designs - have allowed us to succeed in spite of these gambles, but we still need to buy and stock huge quantities of clothing.  That’s a big risk, and a huge expense.This risk is why some clothing brands charge outrageous prices, and then you see them a few months later in discount stores for 75% to 90% off their original price.  Once “the season” is over, they know they won’t get any more money from all their stock, so they can only get rid of it at steep discounts.  It kind of sucks for everyone... and there has to be a better way.I believe that shifting to a Clothing On Demand model is the solution the clothing industry needs.  When I first ran a pre-order sale, I was able to mitigate some of my risk, and that success allowed me to build upon my first product and continue to grow.  I am trying to do exactly the same thing with this Indiegogo campaign today.To evolve with the times, the clothing industry will need to shift to be more “on demand.”  Through this campaign on Indiegogo, I want to test a Clothing On Demand system, where companies like mine have a mechanism to know how much of a product they should create before it is created.By lowering the financial risk to clothing manufacturers like me, you will pay the absolute best price possible.  Manufacturers like me don't need to wonder if there is going to be $2 million worth of inventory sitting in a warehouse for a couple years that no one wants.Bottom line: everyone wins, and this Indiegogo campaign is the first step in my experiment to see if clothing on demand is a viable model for my company and industry.
What are the risks of supporting this campaign?
Essentially… none.

We’ve been in business for 15 years, and our company has been featured all over the news:


If you look at any product on our site, you’ll see tons of amazing reviews.
And if you’re still not convinced that we are legit, just Google SCOTTeVEST and see for yourself.
Creating clothing as complex as mine is a completely different process from making an average piece of clothing. When we create a product design, it is about 50 pages long and contains details and specifications that you might expect to see on blueprints for a high-rise building, not a jacket.  



""There’s more design thought in Scott’s clothing than most smart phones.” - Guy Kawasaki, Chief Evangelist at Canva
Through a process that takes months of back-and-forth with our factories, we work through each minute detail in a process of prototyping that requires multiple iterations and long hours of detailed explanations.
For the Ultimate Pocket Fleece, we have already gone through that entire process… The prototype is our final proof, and the next step is to place an order and kick off production.  At this point, it's not a question of if, but when, so there is really no risk that we won’t deliver on our promises.
We are working with a factory that we have used on dozens of garments before, and their work is top-notch.

The only potential delivery risk would be a delay in shipping, which could hold things up for at most a week.  We have a hold on all materials required for our initial run, and have access to additional materials for follow-up orders.

I'm ready to order… how does sizing work?

To determine which size is best for you, check out our sizing chart below. If you still have questions or if you’re not sure if your favorite device will fit, just ask and we’ll double check for you. 



What is the return/exchange policy?

We will accept exchanges up to 30 days from the original ship date.
Items must be unworn, unwashed and with hangtags still attached.
A Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number is required prior to shipping your package back to us. To obtain an RMA # for your exchange, please fill out the necessary form on our website.
Where can I find high-res photos? 
We are flattered you want some high resolution photos of this garment. Hopefully that means you would like to feature our story. Photos and other assets can be found at SCOTTeVEST.com/IGG or you can contact pr@scottevest.com",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are a triple bottom line company: People, Planet and Profit. This means that we care as much about helping people and the planet as we do about making a profit. The products you will be buying are made in Seattle by refugee women through an organization called Refugee Arts Initiative (<a href=""http://refugeesarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://refugeesarts.org</a>).

<p>We are here to finally add some style to the sport of bowling.   In every Sport there is the ability to color coordinate your uniforms, well today we are giving you bowlers that ability as well.    We are 2 average bowlers who have children who bowl on various sport teams and that is how and why we came up with the idea of adding a more modern High Top shoe to the sport of bowling while giving teams the ability to color coordinate their uniform.        We will initially have 4-5 color patterns available and we will post those colors once they are complete.  </p>
<p>The 50's are over and those old style shoes are now a thing of the past.  We are hear to offer you a more modern look while also providing great ankle support for those who really crank that ball.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge since the start of this project is finding someone to do the SOLE of the shoe.   We know the importance of the sole and the slide and this was a HUGE road block for us.    Many factories loved our idea and many of those same factories wanted to put a HOUSE SHOE bottom on our shoe and we REFUSED and will never have such a bottom.     The good news is we found the right factory and the right bottom for our shoe.   In fact we are now using the same factory that is making the 3G Shoe which means we can put a high quality microfiber slide on the slide shoe and a nice rubber bottom on the nonslide.   Upon a successful launch we will expand and introduce the interchangeable bottoms on this same shoe. (2018 Production run).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We would like to come out the gate with a pretty decent high quality shoe with a very nice high performing sole system while offering this new show under $100 retail.     In fact we expect retail to be $89.99.</p>

<h3>Introducing MAYKR!</h3>
<p>My name's Kate and I have been a keen crocheter for many, many years. </p>
<p>One thing I always struggled with as a 'young' crocheter who travels often, was transporting my projects, and accessories from one place to another IN STYLE. No matter how hard I looked, I just couldn't find a project bag that catered to my needs both aesthetically OR functionally. </p>
<p>After scouring the internet for hours on end, I discovered there was absolutely NOTHING like this (easily and affordably) available to us Aussies!</p>
<p>So, I changed my Google search from 'cute bags for crocheters' to 'custom bag manufacturers', and MAYKR was born!</p>
<p>MAYKR bags are not only pleasing on the eye, but they are an all-in-one handbag AND project bag, that will keep your projects, hooks, accessories and every day handbag items organised. </p>
<p>MAYKR bags look just like your every day handbag on the outside, so will not draw unwanted attention to your crochet. However, on the inside they are a crocheters DREAM bag. </p>

<h3><strong>What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</strong></h3>
<p>NEVER FEAR! In the unfortunate event that we are not able to reach our goal, all funds raised will still be invested into this project, and remaining costs will be covered by me!</p>
<p>The reason I have decided to go down the crowd funding route is purely because it will help me get this project off the ground a whole lot sooner than if I was to fund it myself. Although I'm not relying on this campaign to bring MAYKR to life, every pledge, no matter how big or small will be a huge help in speeding up the process.</p>
<p>No matter the result, all perks will be delivered. Delivery time will depend on whether or not we raise enough funds to begin production straight away.</p>
<p>I am 100% committed to this project and no matter the result, it WILL be going ahead. It may just take a little longer if we don't reach our goal during this campaign. Rest assured MAYKR will come to life, but how quickly will depend on the success of this campaign. So be sure to tell your friends!</p>

</div></div>","Introducing MAYKR!
My name's Kate and I have been a keen crocheter for many, many years. 
One thing I always struggled with as a 'young' crocheter who travels often, was transporting my projects, and accessories from one place to another IN STYLE. No matter how hard I looked, I just couldn't find a project bag that catered to my needs both aesthetically OR functionally. 
After scouring the internet for hours on end, I discovered there was absolutely NOTHING like this (easily and affordably) available to us Aussies!
So, I changed my Google search from 'cute bags for crocheters' to 'custom bag manufacturers', and MAYKR was born!
MAYKR bags are not only pleasing on the eye, but they are an all-in-one handbag AND project bag, that will keep your projects, hooks, accessories and every day handbag items organised. 
MAYKR bags look just like your every day handbag on the outside, so will not draw unwanted attention to your crochet. However, on the inside they are a crocheters DREAM bag. 

 
Features Include:
 
Removable Hook and Accessory Storage - Attaches to inside of bag using two press studs, so you can easily organise and access your tools. No more turning your bag inside out, or having to completely empty your bag in order to organise your tools!
 
Removable Pouch - Perfect for storing 'bits and pieces'. Perfect for those of you who make amigurumi or projects with lots of moving parts - granny squares for example.
The removable pouch also comes with a cross body strap, so you can use it on its own! Perfect if you're ducking out for lunch or dinner, and don't want to take a large bag with you.
 
Other Features Include:
- Made from a quality PU leather which means it's VEGAN friendly!
- Stylish design, complete with gold details and stitching detail down centre of bag (one side only).
- Magnetic button for bag closure.
- Soft suede like fabric lining inside of bag.
- Spacious inside, so you can carry larger (or multiple) projects.
