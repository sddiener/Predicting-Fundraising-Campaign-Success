</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Help support the Lyric Foundation in building an interdisciplinary arts education program that combats homophobia, bullying, racism, and drug addiction.</b></p>
<p>The Lyric
Foundation in Los Angeles, CA, is seeking funding to expand its arts
educational programming with the objective of building an interdisciplinary
arts program that combats social issues such as bullying, drug addiction,
gender inequality, racism, and homophobia.  The objective is to provide students with exposure to multiple
artistic disciplines and give tools to assist in dealing with deprecating
social issues.  Funding in the amount
of $250,000 is requested for training of the ensemble company members, the renting of a classroom
facility, marketing, and resources for the classroom.</p>
<p><b>Statement of Need</b></p>
<p>According to
a 2005 report by the Rand Corporation about the arts, ""[Art] can connect people
more deeply to the world and open then to new ways of seeing.""  It has become increasingly evident
that, due to No Child Left Behind, academic pressures have reduced arts
education in the classroom.  In
California, participation in music courses dropped 46 percent from 1999-2000 according
to a study by the Music for All Foundation.  A study provided by SRI International found that 89 percent
of California K-12 schools failed to offer a standards-based course of study
for disciplines in music, visual arts, theater, and dance.  </p>
<p><b>Program Description</b></p>
<p>The Lyric Foundation is introducing, The Lyric Ensemble’s
Summer Theatre Education Program. 
This interdisciplinary arts program in association with the Lyric
Theatre in Hollywood, California, is designed to train 80 students in the use
of multi-disciplinary arts.  The
ensemble members who have been trained in the use of the arts for personal and
community empowerment will work with the summer students. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The content of the productions, classes, and workshops are
built around themes that combat different social issues such as prevention of
drug addiction, racism, bullying and homophobia.</span></p>
<p>The ensemble members are local gifted LA artists, writers,
musicians and dancers who are dedicating their lives to the training of
underserved youth.  The power of
the arts to support motivation to finish school, to expand their education and
to be of service to their community is a goal that the ensemble members are
modeling through their work in the ensemble.  </p>

<p><b>Goals &amp;
Objectives</b></p>
<p>The Lyric Ensemble is barrier-free, both physically and
attitudinally.  We serve all people

<h3></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello all! My name is Joshua and I'm a 26 year old acting graduate student. One of my earliest memories was watching Richard Burton in <i>The </i>Robe. I was fascinated with the precision of his words and how he inhabited his character. I quoted the movie so much, my parents took the tape away. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to study acting in the UK, but as a home-school kid from rural Virginia, I hadn't thought it was really possible..</p>
<p>In the spring of this year I had the pleasure of auditioning for my dream school, Birmingham City University, and found myself on the waiting list. Just a few weeks ago, I finally received my acceptance letter and my impossible dream started becoming a reality</p>
<p>There's just one complication: I have less than a month to pick up my life and move to a different continent, and I need your help to get me there.</p>
<h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
<p>My family moved to rural Virginia when I was 15 years old and home-schooled me and my siblings in their religious tradition. No one in my family had been to college before, but that wasn't an option for me. For me college was where you learned how to do what you wanted to do well, everyone looked up to as a child was educated. And so, I got my GED, spent two years in community college, and was eventually accepted by Radford University, where I double majored in Theatre and Music.</p>
<p>College was busy. I worked two jobs throughout my undergrad, sometimes taking upwards of 20 credit hours a semester. I took classes, attended rehearsals, acted in shows during the day, and worked throughout the night. But, my hard work paid off, and not only was I able to graduate, but I graduated with honors. Unfortunately, my parents have not helped me further my education, and did not even come to my university graduation.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have been working as a professional actor, musician, and writer in Atlanta, Georgia, including an Acting Apprenticeship at Atlanta's Horizon Theatre. Acting for me has never been about fame and fortune, it's about connecting with people by bringing stories to life. One of my fondest memories is from touring through rural Virginia with the University opera company. After a performance, a small boy came up to me. He was very shy, but wanted to tell me how much he loved the my character, the Dog-King. He said that he didn't understand everything in the show, but he was always happy when he saw the Dog-King, because the other characters were mean to the dog, and because, he said, ""I feel like a dog sometimes too."" I live for that feeling. The feeling of knowing that I have personally connected with someone, and perhaps had a small impact on their lives.</p>
<h3>About the Program, and why it Important to Me</h3>
<p>Birmingham City University offers a one-of-a-kind accelerated one-year MA Program concentrating on the British tradition in acting. It is designed to give International students with a foundation in Realism, and a passion for live performance the opportunity to explore just what it is that makes British acting unique. I have always idolized great British actors such as Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Richard Burton. The clarity and precision these actor’s put into every scene, phrase, and word brought the world of their characters to life for me in a way that I longed to do myself. Each of these actors honed their acting skills with a foundation in the British tradition with Shakespearean, Jacobean, and Restoration texts. BCU will give me a chance to hone my skills in a similarly rigorous manner.</p>
<p>My Goal is to work on London's West End. I believe that with my foundation in American acting, and my training at BCU, I will take London by storm!</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is a tremendous opportunity for me, but getting to Birmingham for school next month is a logistical and financial challenge. In order to make this work, I will need, among other things, plane tickets, housing deposits, and a student visa and I will need to pay for them all up front very soon.</p>
<p>I need your help to raise $2,200 to cover these initial costs, and 100% of every penny I receive will go to my school related expenses. It's a large amount, but every little bit will help, and hopefully I will be able to find people like you who can help me achieve this once impossible dream.</p>
<p>If you are not in a position to help financially, which in these tough economic times is completely understandable, you can still help by spreading the word about my campaign. Post it on social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,smoke signals, messages in bottles, smoke signals, prayer, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe one day, another young kid in the middle of nowhere will see me bring a story to life, and realize that they too have the potential to achieve the impossible.</p></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">

<p> </p></div>","We Have a Question:
What Does A Computer Mean To You?  
For most of us, a computer connects us to friends or colleagues, helps us get work done, or distracts us from the work we should be doing.  When linked to great educational programming and put into the hands of a low-income student, a computer can be the tool that breaks the cycle of poverty. 
You can help.
We need to buy 20 Chromebooks for the 
Brighter Futures Mentoring Program for Homeless and At-Risk Youth.
 
You May Have Some Questions of Your Own:
What The Heck is a Chromebook?
So glad you asked! A Chromebook is a computer, without a hard drive, which uses Google Chrome as its operating system. This makes it a cheap alternative to a laptop with more longevity than the average netbook.  How great is that? 
 
Why Do You Need Them?Brighter Futures has partnered with Budmath, an interactive web based tutoring program to provide tutoring for homeless, low-income and at-risk students.  This software offers white board lessons and test questions for the students as well as checking the answers as they go.  Students can work at their own paces and tutors can work one-on-one with struggling students, increasing the effectiveness and impact of our tutoring sessions. Right now, the students are able to use Budmath only during the school day, if they have free time.  We want every one of our students to have access to the program. 
The students who participate in Brighter Futures are the most at-risk students in Westchester's lowest performing schools.  Participants in the program are primarily homeless, low-income or foster children from Yonkers and Mt. Vernon, NY.  In one of the richest counties in the country, the graduation rate at the school most of our students attend is just 56.1%.  Brighter Futures seeks to improve the odds for children struggling with poverty in failing schools by increasing their grades and test scores, getting them involved with caring adults, and preparing them for success.
 
What’s the Big Deal?Giving the kids in Brighter Futures the tools to succeed will help us break the cycle of poverty for those kids and their families. Our programs have already made a significant difference in the lives of our participants; improving grades, increasing graduation rates, improving test scores and getting kids who never dreamed of a post-secondary education into college.  Providing them with this tool will amplify our impacts and increase their chances at lifelong success.  
The Chromebooks will essentially level the playing field for underprivileged students, giving them effective and individualized tutoring that they otherwise could never afford.  The software focuses on preparing for the Regents Exams, New York’s standardized test to graduate high school, but the lessons also improve classroom performance and college entrance exams scores.
What Can I Do? First: Donate, a lot or a little to help us reach our goal of $6500 (enough to purchase 20 Chromebooks)
Next: Brag about your generosity; tell your friends; share on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Reddit, etc.
AAAAAnd Finally: Sit back and feel good about making a difference in the lives of at-risk kids.

Recently, I’ve finished my Gender Studies degree where I have learned lots of interesting things about gender, sexuality, and performance. Additionally, I’ve also encountered that performance is not something that is necessarily situated in the theater or street, but that we also perform variety of roles in everyday life – like for example, we perform gender, class and some other things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since I have particular interests in practical performance, its political and social effects, and how the practice interacts with scholarly theory, I’ve decided to apply to a program in Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts in New York. When the admissions results came, I was positively shocked. I was even more shocked after I encountered that I received a generous tuition award that covers most of my tuition expenses. However, after researching what does it mean to be a student in New York I found myself in a quite negative shock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I managed to collect some further funds from my friends and family, but still I need some additional financial help for expenses like books, food and other living expenses. If you’re able, would you please help in de-shocking me? Are you a kind helper?   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my future project, I will be dealing with theory on queer subjectivities in correlation with the case study of Antony Hegarty. Did you hear about Antony? I got incredibly touched by Antony’s music and performances, and I perceive her work as poetry that has broader political and social implications. In my opinion, performance can have powerful effects, especially if its results are affects such as excitement, shame, anticipation, and fear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As your help can have healing effects in de-shocking me, Antony’s music and performances can also have healing effects for her targeted audience of a wider transgender and queer community. Please de-shock me with your kindness! Please help me if you’re able to. Send me in New York. In return, I have prepared some interesting perks for you!</p>

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Ayla Sullivan and I am am striving to be the best artist I can be.  I am sixteen years old and my dream is to help my community by supporting the pursuit of art programs in schools through furthering my education in a college level program.</p>
<p>This is a big task to take on, especially for a sixteen year old who already has responsibilites as being an officer on her school's theatre honor society and Improv Club board, a student that is a part of the International Bacculearate program, and an upcoming member of the National Honor Society next year. But, I am up to the challenge. </p>
<p>In the past, I have lead a dance workshop for middle school aged children and was a part of a panel to help coach children's acting monologues at last year's Denver School of the Arts Middle School Theatre Convention. I am a firm believer that theatre has the ability to save people from all backgrounds, all social statuses, and all ages. </p>
<p>So why in my introduction video of this campaign did I say that theatre can help teach others the ""<strong>essence of humanity</strong>""? Honestly, <strong>how can theatre and the performing arts really teach that? </strong></p>
<p>Theatre is more than just ""playing pretend"". It is, as Picasso once said about the nature of art, ""...<em>a lie that reveals the truth</em>."" This manufactured fabrication offered on stages and film media across the globe allows audiences to be captivated by one single idea from a range of thirty minutes to two hours that aims to<em> change their life and perspective</em>. Beyond that, theatre offers a reflection of personalities, real life situations, and true struggles that all humans face at some point in their lives. Exposing children to this art form allows them the ability to not only be entertained, but also gives them an outlet that displays realities of the world that they can be immersed in, whether it be as an audience member or as a member of the ensemble. </p>
<p>Positive expression is easily one of the most important tools needed in every child's (and every human being's) arsenal. The performing arts give students a  healthy medium to explore their wants, needs, dreams, and deepest emotions in a safe and encouraging environment. In a time where education cuts are being made in a multitude of areas in the school system here in the United States, it is imperative to support this necessary component in child development. </p>
<p>Okay, but <strong><em>how does this tie into attending a performing arts program?</em></strong></p>
<p>My goal is to continue to be a working advocate for the arts in my community by volunteering for various arts related activites in elementary and middle schools, as well as working toward creating a Middle School Convention just for students in the Cherry Creek School District. By gaining more leadership experience in this field, I can better myself and ultimately get to a successful level of becoming a performing arts teacher after I get my college education. </p>
<p>It is through this goal that I understand that the biggest factor in accomplishing my dreams is getting the best possible education for myself in the performing arts. </p>
<p>Perry Mansfield Performing Arts School and Camp has been a running institution for the past century. It has nurtured students to their greatest potential as artists in varying fields, and I am honored to have been accepted into their six week pre professional program. This intensive is specifically designed to ease college level students into their artistic careers. It is the perfect opportunity for me to hone on my skills as an artist, become more knowledable in the arts, and give me a competitive edge when I begin to apply to colleges in the not too distant future. Perry Mansfield is the first hurdle I must conquer in my quest for my own education to benefit the education of others. But, the program is outside my financial means, and I need your help to allow me to put my best foot forward in a country with a struggling economy and a cut throat college system. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Help Three Causes for The Price of <em>ONE</em>
</h3>
<p>The tuition for this program is $5,000 dollars and if I raise half of the funds, Perry Mansfield will graciously pay for the other half. </p>
<p>Any amount of money helps and I am grateful to anyone who can take the time to help donate to my cause. The perks attached to this campaign cover an array of interesting, personalized gifts which include letters, art, mix cd's, my own recordings, and other ways I can show you how appreciative I am to you through my art. </p>
<p>In addition to funding my dream, <strong>all proceeds that exceed my goal will be split in half and donated to two other causes: First I will donate to an Oklahoma Relief Non Profit Organization and secondly, I will establish a scholarship for another potential student at Perry Mansfield.</strong></p>
<p><strong> It is important to note that whatever funds I can donate to Oklahoma Relief will be matched by my mother's employers to give the victims and families of the Oklahoma disaster double the relief. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am definitely aware that there are people who would love to donate to my campaign, but just can't contribute right now. The best way to help is through any additional advertising for my campaign, whether that be through word of mouth or various social media websites. Every dollar counts! </p>
<p>To support that idea, <strong>anyone who can signal boost my campaign on three or more websites or posts about my campaign on a single website three or more times: I will name you as a contributor</strong> in the video and/or blog site I will make to sum up what I have learned from Perry Mansfield's program after I (hopefully) attend. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading about my campaign and being interested in funding my dream!</p>

In addition to funding my dream, all proceeds that exceed my goal will be split in half and donated to two other causes: First I will donate to an Oklahoma Relief Non Profit Organization and secondly, I will establish a scholarship for another potential student at Perry Mansfield.
 It is important to note that whatever funds I can donate to Oklahoma Relief will be matched by my mother's employers to give the victims and families of the Oklahoma disaster double the relief. 
 


Other Ways You Can Help


I am definitely aware that there are people who would love to donate to my campaign, but just can't contribute right now. The best way to help is through any additional advertising for my campaign, whether that be through word of mouth or various social media websites. Every dollar counts! 
To support that idea, anyone who can signal boost my campaign on three or more websites or posts about my campaign on a single website three or more times: I will name you as a contributor in the video and/or blog site I will make to sum up what I have learned from Perry Mansfield's program after I (hopefully) attend. 
 
Thank you so much for reading about my campaign and being interested in funding my dream!

<h3>A $5,000 Grant Safety Net for a Student in Medical Crisis</h3>
<p><strong>The Orion Fund</strong> provides grants for college students in medical crisis.  We cover medical, educational and living expenses for students caught in difficult circumstances.  Our students have cancer, traumatic brain injury, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, emergency open heart surgery, car crashes...  the list goes on. Every little bit helps these students - they are often just getting by, with rising college and living costs, and often with families unable to help - and that's before <em><em>they get sick or injured</em>.</em>  </p>

<p>Paula was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma (cancer) her junior year at U.C.

My name is Leaphia Darko and I am a 23yr old actress from Plumstead in South East London who is passionate about theatre and desperate to better herself.
 

I have recently been informed that I have been awarded a place on the BA in Acting course at RADA for September 2013


This year over 3,300 people auditioned for the 27 places on offer over a period of 10 months and through 4 rounds of auditions so I am both amazed and exited at having been offered a place.


I am changing career path as I already have a degree (English and Classics 2:1) so don't qualify for any Student Loans Company funding



 
What We Need & What You Get
 
I need to raise £3000 to be able to register for my first term September 2013 as tuition fees are now £9000 per year. (the extra £250 will leave me with enough to pay the fees after Indiegogo have taken their commission)
 

To say thank you everyone will recieve an e-card from me and higher tier contributors will recieve personal updates of my theatrical progress and my services as a public speaking coach!
 

I am literally scraping the fees together so every penny helps! Whatever I manage to raise will be put towards my fees anyway
The Impact

Training at RADA is a dream come true. It is an elite institution which has trained many of my favourite actors from Vivien Leigh to Ralph Fiennes.

 

This has been the culmination of 7 years of work for me. I auditioned in 2011 and didn't pass the first round. I went away and worked hard. I took unpaid roles in shows with the Roundhouse, The National Youth Theatre, The  Royal Shakespeare Company, The Old Vic New Voices community group and the Olympic and Paralympic Ceremonies to gain experience. This year all of this hard work paid off.

Math assignment you gave suddenly morphed into 42 different scripts that are
waiting for you to grade.  You feel
overwhelmed as all the Creative Writing compositions beg for your attention- and
so do your students. You realize you can’t do it all- and you probably feel
guilty.<br/><br/>
As a student in this large class, you are wondering when the teacher will
finally speak with you. Does she even know your name? Your exercise book has
not been touched by her in a while- does she even care? You feel you are
getting lost, gradually- but no one is there to notice. You’re struggling- but
there’s no one there to help. When asked about it, this is what you have to
say: <br/><br/>
“We were so congested…. you could not have time to ask questions…. There were
few materials. Desks were few and some were forced to sit on the floor. The
teacher could not…. mark our books and so one could not know where he or she
had gone wrong…. (Girl, 14)”<p></p>

<p>My name is Claude (a picture here with my sister) and I am here bacause I am going to Sweden to do my masters and would like to raise money to help me out with my studies. Your contribution will help to achieve that. I have saved money and I am getting some student loans but it is not enough. School fees and living expenses will be about 30,000$ so that 1,500 will get me a plane ticket back home when i am done! :) </p>
<p>Let's put it this way, i gather that most of you will be people I know, so if i don't have time to sit down with all of you to have a glass of wine or two to say goodbye before i leave, just put that money here and save us a hangover!  Seriously though, since my masters will be in  Strategic Leadership towards Sustainability (I am one of 50 people chosen from around the world to do this program), my goal is to work for water conservation, ecosystem restoration and consultation for business of all sizes to help make the triple bottom line (people-planet-profit) the best way to do business. </p>

Let's put it this way, i gather that most of you will be people I know, so if i don't have time to sit down with all of you to have a glass of wine or two to say goodbye before i leave, just put that money here and save us a hangover!  Seriously though, since my masters will be in  Strategic Leadership towards Sustainability (I am one of 50 people chosen from around the world to do this program), my goal is to work for water conservation, ecosystem restoration and consultation for business of all sizes to help make the triple bottom line (people-planet-profit) the best way to do business.

<p><strong><em>And she has them around a VERIFIED CHILD MOLESTER.</em></strong> Who she has been seeing since I got sick. <strong>Something is wrong in her head, she was raped and beat by this same guy when she was 15 and he was 22!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>  <strong> So as I said I have worked most of my life, now that I am considered ""Disabled"" I cant even get unemployment! Which was paid to the ""system"" for me during my work career, but that doesn't seem to mean anything to them!<em> </em></strong><em>But since I am in that condition I have ran out of all my savings and all I have left is my vehicle.</em> How I will pay my rent and the rest that comes with a house and my kids eating and getting them back and forth to school and on my picking them up and dropping them off for parent exchange are things that I have to do or I will lose them to her! I have limited myself to eating once a day to save food for them.</p>

<p><em><strong> Getting help here is all I have to give me hope that there lives are not ruined by child molesters and drug dealers and addicts that have become common place in the mothers life!</strong>  Now the Magnitude of this is beyond my control without help.<strong> So with help I will have the chance of still winning my childrens well being and a future for them that does not become some statistic read about in the paper!</strong> It is a FACT that the people she is friends with have lost children to death and cps yet she allows them around our kids and leaves them alone with them!<strong> But its obvious they are not her main concern, her party life is all she is concerned with! So again with help I can ensure there safety!!! To be with someone for 18 years that turns a 180 degrees on you when you need them the most is bad enough, but to also have to watch her also try and destroy my childrens lives/future is a whole new heartbreak all together!</strong></em></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>.WE NEED a Real Lawyer!!! Well I am hoping I would either 1 be back well enough to work or 2 be getting the disability money back that I paid into the system toward the end of next year!     Every donation no matter how small or large is a tremendous help!  <em> And if you cant help financially I understand, we are not the only ones in bad shape.</em><strong> But if you can just spread the word to everyone you know it is just as valuable!! Just sharing our profile link on G+ or Facebook and Twitter or just plain good old fashion e-mail would be help in and of itself!! And you truly have no idea how much I appreciate both kinds of help!</strong> And just as kind of an fyi, I need money now, but at least if I see that people are helping then I could do a title loan on my truck, knowing that I could repay it! But as things are now if I did a loan on it I would have no way to pay it back. Then it would be taken and I would be in an even worse spot with no way to get my children, no way to court and all around stranded! At least if I lost my house I could sleep in my truck, Please!!! Any help at all would be ever so helpful and we give our Thanks and gratitude!!!! Thank you!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> <em>  I know I am not the only one that understands what a good and healthy childhood means to someone as they then become adults.</em> <strong><em>So the Impact and the difference your help can make would speak volumes in the long run! And I truly believe that my children, in the right environment can grow into some really special individuals!</em></strong> And right now they are at a very impressionable and important age in there lives! Anything bad right now can scar them for life which I could not bare!<strong><em> So to receive help to insure that does not happen would mean more to us then I could ever put into words alone!  </em></strong>Now I have made I think some progress with the judge, but as I said my lawyer has threatened to drop me if I talk about how I feel! Unfortunately that firm was the only one I could afford!<strong> But I guarantee if this campaign goes better then I could hope it does, and if I get enough help I will be able to tell my lawyer to do just what she wants and I could hire a real Attorney! And oh let me tell you, that may be the best thing I could possibly get!</strong><em> Even broke I still would not have them around a child molester and druggies!!!<strong> Which is where there mother keeps demanding they be. But I have only scraped the top of things as far as what I have told you because I just don't have the room to tell it all here. But as a PERK for your donation I will tell the whole story!</strong></em> I believe if someone is willing to help me then they should be given all the info they want! So once again you truly have no idea how much this will be appreciated and remembered!!!</p>

<p><strong>The Product. </strong> Clipp allows you to configure data the way your mind thinks -- in images. A central projectline reinforces the coveted one-on-one method no matter how many students. Our cohesive product design efficiently organizes everything in one place for ease of use. Any curriculum flows naturally. Students can now concentrate more on listening and participating in the class discussion, knowing they can review any written notes, video, or audio uploaded to the projectline, during or after class.  Real-time reporting gives immediate feedback of lesson understanding. Whatever the preferred curricular method, customization is in the hands of the creator, be it student or teacher.  The flipped classroom, flipped back again.</p>
<h2>Clipp STORES AND <strong>ORGANIZES</strong> everything about the classroom all in one convenient, digital place.</h2>
<p><br/>Specifically, here's why we’re excited:<br/><br/><strong>Key Features.</strong><br/>  <br/>1. <em>Projectline:</em>  </p>
<p><img alt=""Example 1 - Projectline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/592835/pictures/original/20130103122403-Clip_Lessonline_645_Annotate_600X450.png?1357244642"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The projectline is literally a grid that is scrollable in any direction, searchable and sortable. It allows teachers to load all necessary files into the grid to teach a class from their iPad. This can be loaded whenever: before the semester begins, during a class or afterwards, allowing for customization. Curricula can even be imported from a third-party creator.  Students with access can load homework assignments, class projects, or access files the teacher loaded. Students can pull files up to review them on their iPad. Files such as movies can be accessed and played as part of the class. Even a live lecture can be recorded during class from the iPad and then stored in the projectline for later playback. The teacher may use a pre-recorded lecture to play in class or students can access that later for review. Since the screens between student and teacher can be interactive, an infinite exchange of information is capable. Clipp truly is the digital hub to the classroom.</p>
<p>2. <em>Data Your Way:</em>  There’s tons of material in any curriculum that needs to be organized and quantified.  Clipp has a reporting function that allows students and teachers with access to cull any information, in any file.  This can be added to the projectline into a polished and organized summary. This saves huge amounts of time, creating the most effective and detailed study guides. All this, with just a few taps of the screen. Additionally, Clipp performs grading upon completion of tests, generates lesson plans and administrative reviews.  Live polling and real time surveys enable greater teacher adaptability to a particular class understanding level. Students can now enjoy running their own study groups, managing class projects, and even uploading their homework to the projectline.<br/><br/>3. <em>Use with Favorites:</em>  Clipp is designed to work in conjunction with all your favorite third party apps.  Whether exchanging information, creating or transferring files, or just communicating, Clipp brings all your favorite apps together in one place to help you achieve the ultimate in knowledge transfer.<br/><br/>All of this helps students and teachers understand learning objectives right where praise or correction is still fresh and meaningful. That's why we say, Clipp is everything a student and teacher does, all at one connection point.  </p>
<h2><span>With Clipp you can also CREATE from stored information. This includes instant study guides, lesson plans, grading, etc.</span></h2>
<p><strong>The iPad.</strong> The bet is about students using more than 10 percent of their brains’ capacity, not on technology. Good technology gets out of the way.  And the iPad does just that.  Is there an elephant in the room about whether the distribution vehicle we’ve chosen is the right option?  To paraphrase a popular Wayne Gretzky quote, “We’re skating to where the puck is going, not where it’s been.”  The iPad occupies over 50% of the tablet market.  It is so dominant that the impact is being felt in PC education sales, which declined 13% in the last year.  The iPad is seeing such fast adoption rates not only because it is school-budget friendly, but more importantly, because educators are seeing results in the classroom.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><br/>What we're seeing with the iPad is that, they[students] are<br/>engaged.  We put the iPad in front of them and you'll see the <br/>kids immediately focus right on that content and start <br/>working through it.  In a short amount of time, we're seeing <br/>gains as high as 50-60% in reading, math and science with <br/>our classes using the iPads. I really believe that this is the <br/>future of education.</p>
<p>            <br/>        -John Connolly, Technology Director of Chicago Public Schools<br/><br/>We couldn’t agree more. Now with Clipp, knowledge is verifiable, quantifiable, and, yes, thanks to the iPad, touchable.</p>
<h2><span>Everything stored is SEARCHABLE AND SORTABLE in real-time (like Google for your classwork).</span></h2>
<p><strong>Us. </strong> We believe in superior American education even more than the many hours we have spent developing this product.  It’s not about creating just another product. Learning is more than throwing a computer in front of a student. We know it is difficult to understand and apply new concepts. Students process things their way, on their time. We feel strongly about taking the organizational format of the message out of the way. This allows the presentation of the idea to take place front and center.  It allows a thought to be dissected, critically assimilated and expounded upon.  With the lesson in place, more time can be devoted to a student’s developing mind and students can look forward to finding new and amazing ways to tap into their own creativity, all while learning required curricula.  That’s what we’re all about.</p>
<h2>Clipp WORKS WITH OTHER APPS, so you don’t have to choose or discard your favorites.</h2>
<p><strong>Tom.</strong> Having put my own children through parochial, public and homeschooling, education remains a top priority. Training co-workers and students in computer-centric programs throughout my technical career has given me the zeal to seek the ultimate in learning potential.  Creating a program is not enough. Persistent pursuit of higher ideals in education has to be the motivating focus.  Both Marty and I believe the time is now to make learning a gray-matter rich and empowering process. We know that our education system deserves to be an example to the world. We believe Clipp is primary to that pursuit.<br/><br/><strong>Marty.</strong> My background includes experience working for and climbing the ladders of some very prominent corporations, including Apple, Target, and Best Buy. I learned many things while working in these competitive environments, and sharing in the successes.  Mostly, the sum of the parts is always more important than the individual. Because of that, I’ve always had a voracious thirst for being part of something bigger, something meaningful.  I’m talking about legacy. When you wake up every morning, what do you see? As Jobs once said, “Do you want to make sugar water, or do you want to change the world?” Education is important. Education is meaningful. And America has fallen significantly behind, so it’s time we rise to the occasion.</p>
<h2><span>Clipp is EVERYTHING a student and teacher does, all at one connection point.</span></h2>
<p><strong>*The Offer.</strong> We believe Clipp should be used by every student and teacher.  We realize that most successful Indiegogo campaigns have given their product as the ultimate incentive. To that end, upon completion of the final version of Clipp, those schools who sign up for beta testing a pilot program will receive a download of the product, free. So let us hear back from those who would like to become part of the movement to put American education in first place. Help us bring student and teacher together in the digital age. Start the discussion at your school to propel this project onward.</p>

Data Your Way:  There’s tons of material in any curriculum that needs to be organized and quantified.  Clipp has a reporting function that allows students and teachers with access to cull any information, in any file.  This can be added to the projectline into a polished and organized summary. This saves huge amounts of time, creating the most effective and detailed study guides. All this, with just a few taps of the screen. Additionally, Clipp performs grading upon completion of tests, generates lesson plans and administrative reviews.  Live polling and real time surveys enable greater teacher adaptability to a particular class understanding level. Students can now enjoy running their own study groups, managing class projects, and even uploading their homework to the projectline.3. Use with Favorites:  Clipp is designed to work in conjunction with all your favorite third party apps.  Whether exchanging information, creating or transferring files, or just communicating, Clipp brings all your favorite apps together in one place to help you achieve the ultimate in knowledge transfer.All of this helps students and teachers understand learning objectives right where praise or correction is still fresh and meaningful. That's why we say, Clipp is everything a student and teacher does, all at one connection point.  
With Clipp you can also CREATE from stored information. This includes instant study guides, lesson plans, grading, etc.
The iPad. The bet is about students using more than 10 percent of their brains’ capacity, not on technology. Good technology gets out of the way.  And the iPad does just that.  Is there an elephant in the room about whether the distribution vehicle we’ve chosen is the right option?  To paraphrase a popular Wayne Gretzky quote, “We’re skating to where the puck is going, not where it’s been.”  The iPad occupies over 50% of the tablet market.  It is so dominant that the impact is being felt in PC education sales, which declined 13% in the last year.  The iPad is seeing such fast adoption rates not only because it is school-budget friendly, but more importantly, because educators are seeing results in the classroom.
What we're seeing with the iPad is that, they[students] areengaged.  We put the iPad in front of them and you'll see the kids immediately focus right on that content and start working through it.  In a short amount of time, we're seeing gains as high as 50-60% in reading, math and science with our classes using the iPads. I really believe that this is the future of education.
                    -John Connolly, Technology Director of Chicago Public SchoolsWe couldn’t agree more. Now with Clipp, knowledge is verifiable, quantifiable, and, yes, thanks to the iPad, touchable.
Everything stored is SEARCHABLE AND SORTABLE in real-time (like Google for your classwork).
Us.  We believe in superior American education even more than the many hours we have spent developing this product.  It’s not about creating just another product. Learning is more than throwing a computer in front of a student. We know it is difficult to understand and apply new concepts. Students process things their way, on their time. We feel strongly about taking the organizational format of the message out of the way. This allows the presentation of the idea to take place front and center.  It allows a thought to be dissected, critically assimilated and expounded upon.  With the lesson in place, more time can be devoted to a student’s developing mind and students can look forward to finding new and amazing ways to tap into their own creativity, all while learning required curricula.  That’s what we’re all about.
Clipp WORKS WITH OTHER APPS, so you don’t have to choose or discard your favorites.
Tom. Having put my own children through parochial, public and homeschooling, education remains a top priority. Training co-workers and students in computer-centric programs throughout my technical career has given me the zeal to seek the ultimate in learning potential.  Creating a program is not enough. Persistent pursuit of higher ideals in education has to be the motivating focus.  Both Marty and I believe the time is now to make learning a gray-matter rich and empowering process. We know that our education system deserves to be an example to the world. We believe Clipp is primary to that pursuit.Marty. My background includes experience working for and climbing the ladders of some very prominent corporations, including Apple, Target, and Best Buy. I learned many things while working in these competitive environments, and sharing in the successes.  Mostly, the sum of the parts is always more important than the individual. Because of that, I’ve always had a voracious thirst for being part of something bigger, something meaningful.  I’m talking about legacy. When you wake up every morning, what do you see? As Jobs once said, “Do you want to make sugar water, or do you want to change the world?” Education is important. Education is meaningful. And America has fallen significantly behind, so it’s time we rise to the occasion.
Clipp is EVERYTHING a student and teacher does, all at one connection point.
*The Offer. We believe Clipp should be used by every student and teacher.  We realize that most successful Indiegogo campaigns have given their product as the ultimate incentive. To that end, upon completion of the final version of Clipp, those schools who sign up for beta testing a pilot program will receive a download of the product, free. So let us hear back from those who would like to become part of the movement to put American education in first place. Help us bring student and teacher together in the digital age. Start the discussion at your school to propel this project onward.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Let's Win This Anyways</h3>
We won't take no from the universe. We're still going to raise the $10K, to provide more opportunities for women to change their own lives through entrepreneurship and learning.</div>
<div>
<h3>How We're Going To Do It</h3>
<p>We are already half way to $10,000, inspired by an anonymous donation of $5K that came in, challenging us to match it!</p>
<p>We are giving ourselves from now until November 16th to raise the rest. Starting today, we will email you every Friday (only once a week! only for two more times!), always sending inspiration too, of course.</p>
<p>So you are slowly weaned off of our daily images of awesomeness :) We hope you have enjoyed being a part of this push with us, and that you will stay with us until the end - as we define it!</p>

<div>
<h3>Our Work</h3>
Here is more information about Unmarked Streets and the programs this funding supports. 95% of this funding goes towards running our programs, with only 5% going towards operational expenses:</div>
<div>
<p>Unmarked Streets is a non-profit in Guatemala that trains women to become entrepreneurs while selling a product that reduces people's environmental impact and improves their quality of life.  </p>
<p>That's called a win-win-win. We don’t give a handout; we give people the tools to walk on their own two feet.</p>
<p>We promote and distribute products that hit one or more of our three charitable objectives: the environment, public health, and education. We have identified these as the three main drivers that keep families trapped in the cycle of poverty.  We have two main community programs that work towards our vision.</p>
<h3>The Sales Program</h3>
<p>We train local women to be entrepreneurs: show them how to run their own businesses, and let them put those skills into practice by selling Unmarked Streets products. They learn how to run a business in a way that helps them, while helping their community at the same time.</p>
<p>Our first product is a clean burning cook stove, which burns firewood more efficiently. It saves the family time and money on buying or collecting firewood, improves respiratory health from reduced smoke inhalation, improves air quality, and reduces deforestation. We are also adding children’s vitamins, sold in upcycled containers, to our suite of products.</p>
<h3>Upcycling and Urban Sustainability (UUS) Education Program</h3>
<p>We want to reach out to more people than just those who are buying and selling our products. We want to provide tools and skills for people to self-improve and protect the environment at the same time.</p>
<p>The UUS Education program is a way to promote this culture shift.  This program teaches innovative workshops that repurpose recycled materials into products ranging from jewelry to household decorations to environmentally friendly household goods. The products have resale value, promote healthier and more ecological ways of living, and develop students’ entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

<h3>Send Students to <a href=""http://www.unr.edu/art/prospectives12.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prospectives '12 International Festival of Digital Art!</a>
</h3>
<p>We seek funding to help send graduate and Phd level students to Prospectives '12 International Festival of Digital Art.  This is the third iteration of our festival which is soley focused on showcasing the work of current graduate and Phd students exploring the creative, interdisciplinary use of digital technologies in their work.  An international call for entries resulted in 84 works for review, of these, 40 have been accepted for the festival by the jury. Any student who was officially enrolled in a graduate or Phd program during the 2012 calendar year was eligible to submit work.</p>
Prospectives focuses entirely upon highlighting the work of graduate student artists, from a range of disciplines, who utilize and experiment with digital media.  This year's festival includes a one-month exhibition in the University’s Sheppard Fine Arts Gallery and other campus venues, such as Present, a day-long symposium of student creative work in the JCSU Theatre; and Project-Sound, a thrilling video screening and surround-sound event in the Fleishmann Planetarium’s Skydome; as well as temporary public art events, experimental works made specifically for the Internet; and a live performance art event at the Nevada Museum of Art.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The majority of events are FREE and open to the public!</div>

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We need $5,000 to provide travel grants to worthy students</li>
<li>What you will get is the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped to support emerging artists to participate in a unique and significant international media festival.  You will also receive recognition in festival publications (programs, website, etc) as well as selected gifts depending upon your level of funding.</li>
<li>All funds donated will go direclty to the students!  We provide specific travel grants to round-trip flights to and from Reno.  These range from $200 to over $1000 for non-U.S. based students.  The majority of our grants are in the $300 range. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Prospectives Festival is often the first opportunity for young, emerging artists to share their work in such a professional context.  This event truly changes lives!  The temporary community that is established by providing funding for the students to travel to the festival is crucial!  These students are so appreciative of the opportunity to travel to Reno, show their works while also interacting with each other and our community.  This festival changes lives!  Both for the students and for our local students and members of the Reno community and beyond. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Funding goes direclty to students!</strong> Your funding will go directly to support the awarding of travel grants to individual students to attend and participate in Prospectives '12.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your funding may go twice as far! </strong> We encourage all travel grant recipients to seek matching funding from their individual schools.  Many students are able to use our grants to leverage funding to further support their attendance to Prospectives. </li>
<li>
<strong>80% of festival funding goes to students!</strong> This is the third offering of our festival, historically our 2006 and 2009 events involved approximately 80% of the festival budget being allocated towards travel grants for students - we anticipate a similar level of funding/travel awards for the 2012 festival. </li>
<li>At present we have secured funding to allow us to bring in roughly 2/3rds of the selected students.  Your donation will help us as we work towards our goal of fund all the accepted students to travel to the festival! </li>

FIRST encourages students of all ages to focus on STEM (Science, Teachnology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields and careers in order to continually better ourselves and our society.  Being a part of an robotics team gives students hands-on, real-world experience and education (while being fun!).  Going to the Championships will give us a greater understanding of STEM in the world and encourage cooperation with mutliple nationalities (over 60 countries send teams) to solve the world's problems.</div>

<p>My name is <strong>Nathan Agin</strong>, and I'm a location-independent nomad. I've been on the road for almost three years, living out of a backpack, and now I'm excited for my NEXT adventure...</p>
<p>I'm joining <strong>International Volunteer HQ</strong> (<a href=""http://www.volunteerhq.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.volunteerhq.org</a>) to spend 2 weeks in <strong>Quito, Ecuador</strong> to work with the Street Children program:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Work involves children of all ages and consists of helping with basic school lessons, playing with the children, singing and dancing, providing hygiene awareness (such as teaching the importance of washing hands) and introducing them to activities (such as painting) that they have not been exposed to previously.</p>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This project is important to me for 3 reasons:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Foreign Travel:</strong> I've never been to South America and I'm excited to immerse myself in a new culture, meet new people, see different places, and leave with new ideas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Family Time:</strong> my brother is coming with me, and it's going to be an awesome opportunity to spend more time with him.</li>
<li>
<strong>Giving Back:</strong> to devote two weeks to this program, to work with these kids, to experience that connection, and to help them better their lives—that is going to be amazing!</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>By contributing to this project, <strong>YOU are directly connected to ALL THREE of these items</strong>—</p>
<ul>
<li>you are supporting me in my quest to push my comfort zone and expand my perspectives</li>
<li>you are helping me spend more time with the people I love</li>
<li>and you are allowing me time to put my life on hold and just focus on these kids.</li>

<h3>What This Costs</h3>
<p>IVHQ is one of the most affordable volunteering programs out there (woohoo!)—and here are what the funds will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$400 - Ecuador Program Fees (room/meals/organization)</li>
<li>$260 - IVHQ Registration Fees</li>
<li>$25 - Background Check (for the program)</li>
<li>$130 - Travel Insurance (required)</li>
<li>$130 - 20 hour Spanish Course</li>
<li>$260 - Travel in country, weekly/misc. expenses</li>
<li>$150 - Fees for indiegogo and PayPal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total: $1355. </strong></p>
<p>(these are solely my costs; this does not include my brother's trip)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The campaign is set up that WHATEVER is raised, I will receive—and I'm extremely appreciative for that. As I mention in the video, I have already covered all this (with a credit card), so <strong>I'm going either way—</strong>it'd just be nicer to have a way to pay for all of it when I get back. :)</p>
<p>Again, as I list out all the expenses, it's a bit crazy that I'm doing this right now, but I so trust that it's the right thing to do, and that it will all work out in the end.</p>
<p>One thing I did *NOT* list (and often the most expensive part) is <strong>my flight to and from Ecuador</strong>; I already paid for that—and <strong>it was only $62</strong>. Yes, you read that right, and no, I'm not flying in cargo. Perhaps that's something you want me to teach you...? ;)</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What You Can Get</h3>
<div>This isn't all about me—no way! It's about how I can HELP and be of SERVICE, not only to those kids in Ecuador, but also to YOU, too!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong> So how can I help you?</strong> Maybe I can GIVE you something, or DO something for you, or TEACH you something?? What do you need?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's what I know I can offer:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>

<p><strong>And finally, once again... THANK YOU!!</strong></p></div>","7/13 Update: Now that we're beyond the goal...
I can put extra money raised toward SUPPLIES!
Yes, when I land in Quito, the other volunteers and I will brainstorm what we'll do and then go shopping for what we can buy to help make this an amazing experience for the kids, whether that is art supplies, game items, or other cool stuff!
So THANK YOU for your contributions, and you can keep 'em coming!
 


Join this crazy ride...
My name is Nathan Agin, and I'm a location-independent nomad. I've been on the road for almost three years, living out of a backpack, and now I'm excited for my NEXT adventure...
I'm joining International Volunteer HQ (www.volunteerhq.org) to spend 2 weeks in Quito, Ecuador to work with the Street Children program:
 
Work involves children of all ages and consists of helping with basic school lessons, playing with the children, singing and dancing, providing hygiene awareness (such as teaching the importance of washing hands) and introducing them to activities (such as painting) that they have not been exposed to previously.


 
This project is important to me for 3 reasons:



Foreign Travel: I've never been to South America and I'm excited to immerse myself in a new culture, meet new people, see different places, and leave with new ideas.

Family Time: my brother is coming with me, and it's going to be an awesome opportunity to spend more time with him.

Giving Back: to devote two weeks to this program, to work with these kids, to experience that connection, and to help them better their lives—that is going to be amazing!

 
By contributing to this project, YOU are directly connected to ALL THREE of these items—

you are supporting me in my quest to push my comfort zone and expand my perspectives
you are helping me spend more time with the people I love
and you are allowing me time to put my life on hold and just focus on these kids.

You're a pretty amazing person. :)



mi hermano Jamie y yo (practicing my español!)
 


What This Costs
IVHQ is one of the most affordable volunteering programs out there (woohoo!)—and here are what the funds will go to:

$400 - Ecuador Program Fees (room/meals/organization)
$260 - IVHQ Registration Fees
$25 - Background Check (for the program)
$130 - Travel Insurance (required)
$130 - 20 hour Spanish Course
$260 - Travel in country, weekly/misc. expenses
$150 - Fees for indiegogo and PayPal

Total: $1355. 
(these are solely my costs; this does not include my brother's trip)
 
The campaign is set up that WHATEVER is raised, I will receive—and I'm extremely appreciative for that. As I mention in the video, I have already covered all this (with a credit card), so I'm going either way—it'd just be nicer to have a way to pay for all of it when I get back. :)
Again, as I list out all the expenses, it's a bit crazy that I'm doing this right now, but I so trust that it's the right thing to do, and that it will all work out in the end.
One thing I did *NOT* list (and often the most expensive part) is my flight to and from Ecuador; I already paid for that—and it was only $62. Yes, you read that right, and no, I'm not flying in cargo. Perhaps that's something you want me to teach you...? ;)

 
What You Can Get
This isn't all about me—no way! It's about how I can HELP and be of SERVICE, not only to those kids in Ecuador, but also to YOU, too!
 

 So how can I help you? Maybe I can GIVE you something, or DO something for you, or TEACH you something?? What do you need?
 
Here's what I know I can offer:



My COOKBOOK AND NUTRITIONAL GUIDE, ""Nonstop Awesomeness in the Kitchen""—30 recipes and 60+ pages of ideas plus bonuses! (see www.nonstopawesomeness.com/cookbook for more info)



 




My ""$5 FLIGHT TO HAWAII"" Virtual Course—learn how to get there for a fraction of the cost! (more info here: http://www.nonstopawesomeness.me/book-5-dollar-flight-to-hawaii-course)

A consumer class action, by consumers and for consumers.<br/><br/>What is the project specifically?<br/><br/>We will be suing Chase Bank in California in a Class Action for Wrongful Foreclosure and Fraudulent Unjust Enrichment (along with other charges) under the CLRA and Business and Professional Code 17200 (along with other statutes).  We have the initial complaint mostly done and will be completing it as the fund-raising is going on. We plan to file no later than June 30th, 2011 barring any acts of God or Government. <br/><br/>Why should I believe you?<br/><br/>We have over 15 years of direct experience in these fields. We have thousands of pages of documents and hundreds of pages of notes relating to this matter. We have been researching this issue since November 2010 when it was first brought to our attention. We do legal research for a living and have been retained by law firms to teach them how to litigate on matters of this nature. <br/><br/>I don't understand what the big deal is?<br/><br/>JP Morgan Chase arranged to buy approximately $400 billion worth of assets from the FDIC back in 2008. <br/><br/>Due to multiple lawsuits surrounding those assets, the transaction between the FDIC and Chase has never closed and therefore Chase does not yet own these assets.<br/><br/>Imagine if someone arranged to buy a large apartment complex. The would-be purchaser puts a deposit on the property and signs a contract to purchase the building. The closing date on the contract is six months from the date the contract is signed. Now imagine that there are MULTIPLE lawsuits contesting who actually owns the building and also whether or not the seller had the right to sell the building in the first place.<br/><br/>  Now here is the important part: the purchaser (Chase), before the deal has closed, starts to collect rent and evict tenants, even though they aren't the owners of the property yet. Now imagine that the closing date on the contract keeps getting set to some point in the future. While this is going on the buyer (Chase) continues to collect rents and evict people. THIS IS ILLEGAL!!! You can't exercise rights that you don't have.<br/><br/>You can not evict (foreclose) people without actually owning the property! It is just common sense. And just FYI, you can't legally collect the rent (mortgage) payments either... <br/><br/>This means that anyone who had a Washington Mutual loan may have a claim against Chase Bank. <br/><br/>We have found a few of those people and we are actively pursuing a Class Action against Chase Bank in California. We will be suing on behalf of everyone in California who was wronged. Why California? Because there are very consumer friendly laws here that allow non-lawyers (read: consumers) to sue on behalf of other consumers for the injustices they all suffered. It also doesn't hurt that California contains roughly 35% or more of all of Washington Mutual's loan portfolio, making it the largest and friendliest venue for this action. <br/><br/>Can we prevail on our own? <br/><br/>No, we need your support to do this. Otherwise we will likely be railroaded by the bank's attorneys. <br/><br/>Why don't you just get an attorney on board for this?<br/><br/>We have spoken with a number of plaintiff-side class action firms in San Francisco and Los Angeles and they have so far declined to take the case for two main reasons.<br/><br/>One: This isn't their specialty and they won't make the time to read everything that we've read (thousands of pages). <br/><br/>Two: This isn't a good bet for them economically. Foreclosure law has been notoriously unpredictable in the past and law firms are hurting financially right now.The firms that we have talked to aren't willing currently to risk large sums of money just to have the government or the courts weighing in with some ridiculous statement like, ""The banks aren't held to that law like everyone else is."" <br/><br/>We will be continuing to speak with other class-action firms and one may be inspired by the community support that we bring and take the case on alongside us. <br/><br/>NONE OF THE LAW FIRMS HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS NOT A CLAIM HERE. <br/><br/> Are we afraid? <br/><br/>To be honest, a little bit. Chase is the largest corporation in the world by asset volume. Only with a massive outpouring of public support will we be able to win this. We plan to reach out to politicians for support as well, but we need your support to show that this is a populist issue before they will take the time to look at it. You already know what you can do to make a difference, click that big button and donate! <br/><br/> What will we be doing with the money?<br/><br/>We have launched a website at <a href=""http://www.chaseaction.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.chaseaction.com</a> where we will be chronicling our efforts against Chase in a weekly web-series. We will cover case updates and educating people about the theory and back-story of this whole WAMU / Chase transaction. We will also be using the site to help identify potential members of the class.<br/><br/> If we raise a LOT of money...<br/><br/>We will use it to promote the issue on as many public forums as possible. Newspapers, billboards, TV, web ads, anything and everything to get the message out. And lastly, we will be using some small amounts to live on while we work on this full time. We currently do not have to pay for rent and have basically no overhead short of cell-phone and internet bills. There could potentially be travel and other such expenses so literally every dollar counts! <br/><br/>So what are the rewards?<br/><br/>Justice Badges. They will be hand cast and customized by local artists and craftsmen/women in the San Francisco area. The Justice Badge tells everyone that you supported the cause of Justice!<br/><br/>T-shirts are up for grabs as well.<br/><br/> On the front the shirt reads, ""I supported a class action lawsuit against Chase Bank and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.""

<p>Rock it! is an app designed to help children age 7-12 master a musical instrument by making practice sessions more rewarding and fun. Rather than using the tablet as the teacher, our app aims to enhance, rather than replace, human instruction. The tablet, smartphone and web versions of Rock it! form a unique 'practice ecosystem' where parents and teachers can remain actively involved in a student's progress without nagging or causing relationship stress.</p>
<p><img alt=""Rock it! Coolboard"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lightfast.ca/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Coolboard.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<h3><strong>For Kids</strong></h3>
<p>Parents and children set up Rock it! together, establishing practice times, duration, and rewards. Before a practice session, Rock it! runs a student through a helpful checklist to make sure they're focused and ready to play. During practice, Rock it! blocks access to other apps and incoming texts, reducing distractions. After practice, Rock it! provides a number of compelling, customizable gamified 'progress experiences' to encourage kids to keep at it.</p>
<p>The key to Rock it! is our reward system. In addition to earning digital reward badges for display on our private, secure in-app social network, kids can also get stickers, temporary tattoos and iron-on badges (purchased by parents through our smartphone app) to mark major practice milestones.</p>

<h3><strong>For Parents</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>Rock it! helps parents and guardians stay on top of their child's practice regimen without resorting to nagging. A special smartphone app, Rock it! Dashboard, allows busy parents to monitor their child's practice schedule, track progress, send encouraging messages and re-order reward packs on the go. The Rock it! Dashboard allows multiple caregivers to check progress on the same Rock it! account independently, smoothing relations when a child is moving back and forth between two households.</p>
<p><em>What if they don't practice?</em> Rock it! can notice an individual student's practice patterns and make connections to provide support if practice drops off. Rock it! will send encouraging personal emails to the student and motivational strategies to the parent. If a certain item on the pre-practice checklist is regularly being ignored, Rock it! can gently encourage parents to focus on this area.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In December 2009, twelve medical students packed their suitcases full of medical supplies, and with eager hearts, left for Ahmedabad, India. Our mission: To provide health care and services to the patients of Civil Hospital and aid with village health programs during our six day stay.  We call ourselves ESCape to India: Education*Service*Culture. ESCape to India is composed of medical student volunteers dedicated to bringing health and hope to those who are less fortunate.  We are an entirely student-run, and student-founded organization. We currently have twenty members, and continue to expand our presence. <br/><font size=""2""></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Poverty and lack of medical care are daily obstacles to many of the people of India.  Those of working age have left their villages for the cities in pursuit of jobs, leaving a town composed mostly of children and the elderly. As a group of medical students and professionals, we will use our collective knowledge and skills to address the health needs of the communities we serve.<br/> <br/>More than just medicine is needed to improve the long-term health of the people we serve, and ESCape to India takes great strides to educate the population regarding the causes of these illnesses and the appropriate measures that can be taken to prevent them. The purpose of our first trip was primarily to make a community assessment, using interviews with villagers and focus group discussions following our stay in the city. In doing so, we collected demographic information to better understand where our efforts are needed most. Assessments showed that reproductive screening and management is an aspect of health that can be improved upon. Therefore, we plan to use monetary donations to purchase equipment and supplies for Pap smear screenings. Additionally, wound infections are commonly seen amongst the villagers; providing supplies and education of wound care will certainly augment community health. <br/> <br/>Our vision and commitment is to return every year to the clinic and continue with medical follow-up and further address the health needs of the community by putting even more emphasis on education and long-term preventive medicine. Over the coming year, we will be actively fundraising and creating cultural awareness within our medical community to be able to return to our ""adopted"" village in Rangpur - a 4 hour journey from Baroda, India -  with a physician, an abundance of supplies, and instruments. With these resources, villagers will be able to have access to more comprehensive medical care.  Our preventive health measures include recruiting dental health professionals and providing education on dental hygiene, sexual health, and chronic disease prevention. <i><br/></i><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact 
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In December 2009, we provided Rangpur village with 0.5 lakh rupees (US $1000) towards medical supplies and surgical costs. We treated 300+ patients with help from local translators and physicians recruited by the Shroff Foundation. This visit enabled us to understand cultural values and resources needed for future planning and development. One-fourth of the donations went to Civil Hospital's Patient Services Department, providing basic needs for patients during their hospitalization.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The remaining three-fourths were given to Rangpur village for surgical operations and measured through patients' pre/post-operative documentation. On our next trip, we will track patients seen with specific management plans using EMR to better tailor supplies and assistance needed, measure the number of medical supplies distributed, quantify health awareness through follow-up surveys, and conduct ""training the trainer"" workshops so that villagers can continue screening and preventive health education. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For this, we need financial support - most of us are funding our travel and stay in India completely out of pocket, and rely on the generosity of those like you to help provide sustainable health care changes to Rangpur village in Baroda.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Bobby and I am in middle school.  I am 13 years old and for my Bar Mitzvah project I am trying to raise money for the kids who are hurricane victims of the recent Hurricane Sandy.  I will collect this money and give it to the Red Cross at the end of this project.  This is important because I am learning to make a difference in the world.  I feel sorry for those kids because they lost all their stuff.  I would like to get them back what they lost or at least help.  In an emergency I would appreciate all the help I could get.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I put in $5, would you give at least $5 or more to my project?  You will be helping me with my project and helping kids to get back on their feet.  $500 is my goal.  Whatever I earn will go to the Red Cross for kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope you want to help like I do.  I heard about Hurricane Sandy on television, in school, on the internet, on facebook, youtube...really everywhere.  It looked devistating.  I think any amount you and I can raise will help.</p>

<span style=""line-height: 26px; font-size: medium;"">Why Art Matters</span><br/>
</h3></span></h1>
Art touches your life whether you consider yourself to be an artist or not.   Whether you have season tickets to the symphony or watch the latest superhero movies.  These, and everything in between, were brought to the world by artists.  Art as a discipline is often brushed aside, not prioritized or not seen as a measure of intelligence.  You yourself might have once had dreams of being a photographer, but were pushed into something more stable (and maybe a bit more boring) instead. Kids crave creative expression.  When they are young, they tell stories, paint pictures, dance, sing and pretend.  And then many of us lose that along the way.  We get self conscious.  We get serious.  We hide.  And that happens throughout the teen years, but it doesn't have to. I believe it's our responsibility  to encourage artists in their most fragile state- when they are young.  </div><div><b>What is CAMP?</b></div><div>
<b>
</b><p>The
<b>Community Arts Mentoring Program (CAMP)</b> will be a non-profit center where middle and high schoolers in New York can go to
pursue a variety of different artistic disciplines. They will be able to work
independently as well as have the benefit of a <b>mentor</b> partnership with a professional artist, musician, dancer, etc. 
There are 3 main goals of CAMP.  First it will provide <b>a safe place </b>for young people to go where they can
interact in a positive way.  Secondly, it
will offer an opportunity for these students to <b>pursue their creativity</b> in ways they may not otherwise cultivate given the depletion of music and art resources
in public schools.  This pursuit of mastery will  foster the ability express themselves in
a confident, constructive and tangible way through gallery shows, performances
and individual portfolios.  Finally,
through the mentorship program, young people will be able to develop personal
relationships with professional artists who are experts in their respective
fields.  This will not only bridge a
divide between disparate elements of New York society but also provide a <b>role
model</b> students can emulate if they choose to pursue a career in the
arts. </p>
</div><div>
<b>About Me</b><br/>My name is Lindsay Manolakos.  I've been teaching in public schools in  Brooklyn for almost 10 years. I'm also an artist.  I'm a painter and a writer, and I'm always looking for ways to incorporate creativity in and out of my class because I know the value it can bring to a person's life.  I put on plays where the kids design costumes, paint scenery, build sets and of course, they get to perform.  That is when I see kids come alive.  I see excitement, pride, and leadership.  Before a show even ends, they start talking about the next one.  If they had a choice, they would stay in the school all evening painting, sewing and building if security guards didn't have other plans. This constant request for more, bigger and better art is what  inspired this program.    There are a lot of reasons why kids in East NY might want to stay within the safe walls of a school building.  All of those reasons are why I'm creating CAMP.</div><div>I also love biking. I don't ride fast, but I do ride far.   I go on epic(isn) rides around the city and surrounding areas.  And I have a (not so) secret desire to get everyone I know on two wheels.  Therein lies the connection between an art center and a bike-a-thion.</div><div> </div><div>
<p><b>What We Need</b><br/></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise at least $7,500 to cover a lot of the costs associated with starting non-profit.  This includes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative Fees - $2600  (ie State/Fed licensing, legal &amp; consultant fees) </li>
<li>Website development and hosting - $600</li>
<li>Fall Benefit Concert costs - $800</li>
<li>Marketing materials - $500 (ie promotional video, CAMP brand development)</li>
<li>Securing a venue for CAMP for 7/2015 - $2000</li>
</ul>
<div>We are going to have a number of fundraisers over the course of this year, but this money is needed now because it will allow us to get 501c3 non-profit status and apply for grants as soon as possible.</div>
</div><div> <p><b>What we are willing to do</b></p>
<p>Ride bikes all day!   I am organizing a 75 mile bike ride around Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.  We will be riding on <b>SATURDAY AUGUST 16th.  </b>(Rain date, Sunday August 17th.  Uber rain date, Saturday august 23rd.)   You can show your support of this campaign by <b>sponsoring that ride or riding yourself! </b> As much as we need the funds, we'd also really like to have boatloads of people participating in the ride.  This is a community inspired campaign and we'd like as many members of the community supporting us via their checkbook or via their fixie.  <b>You don't have to ride all 75 miles.</b>  You can jump in and out at any of the 6 checkpoints along the way.  If you want to ride, and you didn't get the pdf attachment showing the route and checkpoints, send me an email and I'll send it right over.  <b>camp.lindsaymanolakos@gmail.com</b> </p>
<p>*All riders must wear a <b>helmet </b>while riding. (That's just common sense) </p>
<p>*Neither CAMP nor Lindsay Manolakos assumes any responsibility for injuries sustained (including your sore butt) during this ride.   While we encourage lots of participation, you may not want this day to be the day you learn to ride a bike.  </p>
</div><div>
<div>
<b>Other Ways You Can Help</b> </div>
<ul>
<li>If you can't ride, you could meet us at one of the checkpoints with water and cliff bars. (I like the peanut toffee crunch flavor) </li>
<li>
<b>Make some noise! </b>  Blow up all your social media accounts and share this with your circles! </li>
<li>If you are an artist, and might be interested in mentoring, please contact me at <b>camp.lindsaymanolakos@gmail.com</b><br/>
</li>
<li>If you are a business and might be interested in being a sponsor for our fall benefit concert, please email me.  </li>

Ride bikes all day!   I am organizing a 75 mile bike ride around Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.  We will be riding on SATURDAY AUGUST 16th.  (Rain date, Sunday August 17th.  Uber rain date, Saturday august 23rd.)   You can show your support of this campaign by sponsoring that ride or riding yourself!  As much as we need the funds, we'd also really like to have boatloads of people participating in the ride.  This is a community inspired campaign and we'd like as many members of the community supporting us via their checkbook or via their fixie.  You don't have to ride all 75 miles.  You can jump in and out at any of the 6 checkpoints along the way.  If you want to ride, and you didn't get the pdf attachment showing the route and checkpoints, send me an email and I'll send it right over.  camp.lindsaymanolakos@gmail.com 
*All riders must wear a helmet while riding. (That's just common sense) 
*Neither CAMP nor Lindsay Manolakos assumes any responsibility for injuries sustained (including your sore butt) during this ride.   While we encourage lots of participation, you may not want this day to be the day you learn to ride a bike.  


Other Ways You Can Help 

If you can't ride, you could meet us at one of the checkpoints with water and cliff bars. (I like the peanut toffee crunch flavor) 

Make some noise!   Blow up all your social media accounts and share this with your circles! 
If you are an artist, and might be interested in mentoring, please contact me at camp.lindsaymanolakos@gmail.com

If you are a business and might be interested in being a sponsor for our fall benefit concert, please email me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul>
<li>We want to be open about what we're doing and how we're doing it. Crowd funding makes certain that  we are open and honest with you, our supporters and future customers. We want to keep you informed of our progress every step of the way. Our challenges, our triumphs, our delights are all things that we believe we should share with you.</li>

<p>Our AfriQuest trip-documentary has been for sure a life changing experience and a very good lesson for us. Every day we feel more
and more the need to offer as much as possible to this beautiful continent.
Unfortunately, lots of children do not have the same chances as the ones in the
Western world, and the lack of education can be easily seen. </p>
<p>Visiting the St George Orthodox Primary School in Kibera, the second biggest slum in Africa, we
felt that it is our obligation to gather money from friends around the world
and help these beautiful kids that deserve a better future.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we started the Help2Learn fundraising campaign..</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But let's say few things about the school first:</span><br/></p>
<br/><p><b><u>ST. GEORGE ORTHODOX PRIMARY SCHOOL</u></b></p>
<p>The school is located in Kibera slums of Kianda and Bombolulu,
in the church compound [St. George Orthodox church].</p>
<p>The operation of the school started in 1991.  Today, it has a population of 180 pupils from
various denominations and ethnic backgrounds and it is a day school. The
institution is being run by the Orthodox Archbishopric of Kenya and has a total
of 13 workers including the teachers and other subordinate staff.</p>
<p>The
buildings in place have been purely been built by the church and other well-wishers.
It began with only one class and currently it has three operating classes with a fourth one being under construction. The structures are made out of iron sheets and timber.
It consists of an administration office, a kitchen, classes and a hall which
was formerly a church. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/847803/files/20140910115958-IMG_1267.JPG?1410375598"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Most of the pupils are either fully or
partially sponsored by the Orthodox Church under the leadership of His Eminence
Archbishop Makarios.</span><br/></p>
<p>It is worthy noting that the services  that the school has offered since it started  have been inspiring and this has made the
school to be recognized be very positive among the community in Kibera and its
outskirts.</p>
<p>There is need for other buildings/
structures to be put in place, alongside classes such as the fence, a library, school supplies, etc. This
challenge having been sorted out, the school will make positive milestones
towards achieving its goals. As a result, more and more children will have access to education :)</p>

Our AfriQuest trip-documentary has been for sure a life changing experience and a very good lesson for us. Every day we feel more
and more the need to offer as much as possible to this beautiful continent.
Unfortunately, lots of children do not have the same chances as the ones in the
Western world, and the lack of education can be easily seen. 
Visiting the St George Orthodox Primary School in Kibera, the second biggest slum in Africa, we
felt that it is our obligation to gather money from friends around the world
and help these beautiful kids that deserve a better future.
This is the reason that we started the Help2Learn fundraising campaign..



But let's say few things about the school first:
ST. GEORGE ORTHODOX PRIMARY SCHOOL
The school is located in Kibera slums of Kianda and Bombolulu,
in the church compound [St. George Orthodox church].
The operation of the school started in 1991.  Today, it has a population of 180 pupils from
various denominations and ethnic backgrounds and it is a day school. The
institution is being run by the Orthodox Archbishopric of Kenya and has a total
of 13 workers including the teachers and other subordinate staff.
The
buildings in place have been purely been built by the church and other well-wishers.
It began with only one class and currently it has three operating classes with a fourth one being under construction. The structures are made out of iron sheets and timber.
It consists of an administration office, a kitchen, classes and a hall which
was formerly a church. 



Most of the pupils are either fully or
partially sponsored by the Orthodox Church under the leadership of His Eminence
Archbishop Makarios.
It is worthy noting that the services  that the school has offered since it started  have been inspiring and this has made the
school to be recognized be very positive among the community in Kibera and its
outskirts.
There is need for other buildings/
structures to be put in place, alongside classes such as the fence, a library, school supplies, etc. This
challenge having been sorted out, the school will make positive milestones
towards achieving its goals. As a result, more and more children will have access to education :)

   What We Need & What You Get We had set as an initial goal the amount of $2,000 just to start going, but now, as there is a lot of potential, we hope to be able to get at least to $4,000 and help with some priorities as:
- New classroom (made of iron sheets) : $1,400
- Furniture (desks, blackboard, etc) : $700
- Library, fully equipped with books : $600
- School supplies (notebooks, pencils, rubbers, etc) : $300
- Playground  and sports equipment : $800
- First aid medical kits and hygienic equipment : $200
For any amount donated, we will reward you for your generosity by sending you a personal ''Thank you'' picture with your name on it from a child of the school!

<p>My name is Julia Vieau and I am raising $3000 to travel to Mysore India in January 2013 to study ashtanga yoga. I plan to practice yoga at the Sri K. Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga institute for two months.</p>
<p>I began practicing Ashtanga Yoga with dedication about two years ago. This means that each morning, 5-6 times a week, I rise early and go to the studio to do my practice. Practicing Ashtanga in the mysore style is unique in that each day I do the same series of postures to the rhythm of my own breath. The postures create a stable framework through which I can see myself transform. I continue to become stronger and more flexible in my body and in my life. I want to go to India to deepen my practice by traveling to its place of origin and learning from some of the best ashtanga teachers that exist today.</p>
<p>My experience in India will enrich my experience of yoga as well as inspire my art and my cooking. By supporting my campaing you are investing in me and my future!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The $3000 that I am raising goes to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>a plane ticket for $1500</li>
<li>$1000 to study at the ashtanga yoga institute for 2 months</li>
<li>$500 towards living expenses while I'm there</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm including perks to express my gratitude for your contribution! I deeply appreciate donations of any amount. It means so much to me to have the support of my community.</p>
<p>Please share this campaign with your friends and family! You can tell them in person, email a link, post it on facebook!</p>

<h3>WE GOT SKILLZ</h3>
<p>UNESCO states that every child has the right to education and the right to play. The goal of this event is to bring both of those basic needs together to create a groundbreaking experience for Ugandan children, thus leaving a lasting impression.</p>
<p>African countries are seen by the West as needing ""help"" or ""charity"", but we believe that in Uganda it is more important to build community, create team-work,  foster creativity and reinstate the ability to dream so that the seeds sown are local, organic and sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>WHY SOCCER?</strong></p>
<p>Soccer relies on the above-mentioned elements for success because the total of the team is greater than the sum of its parts... and the youth in Uganda understand soccer (the national sport); both as an escape and distraction, but also a chance to dream, be creative and find common-ground with one-another.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ben Newman, I recently shelved my fitness business in the hopes of working with an organization doing REAL good in the world. I have experience with professional soccer academies, 10 years in the fitness industry and love teaching so I am excited to be sharing it with such a great cause!</p>
<p>The soccer academy has been running since '96 and Bavubuka Allstarz has been doing good work in Uganda for over 10 years. </p>
<p>I am blessed with the opportunity to do something ""bigger than you and me""; a mantra passed down from a friend who passed away recently.  He talked about doing things out of love, being peaceful/compassionate, being grounded in the foundation of who you are morally and treating the world as your family. He was supposed to be on this trip but passed before making that dream possible.  RIP Randy Ponzio.  </p>
<p>Now at 33 I am energized to share my unique skills and talents on a global scale. So I am going to... with your help!""</p>
<p><strong>That is why this project is so important...</strong></p>
<p>Everyone wants to ""save the children"" and ""give to the poor"" .... But East Africans are far from helpless. Often, however they need 'opportunity' in order to thrive.  Rather than ""give a man a fish"" we're ""teaching a man to fish"".  I like to think of what we are doing as educating, training and facilitating the opportunity to dream a bigger dream.</p>
<p>70% of uganda's population is under the age of 30, (almost 24 million people.) I turned 33 this year and I cannot begin to know what my childhood, adolescence, teen and young adult years would have been like without the opportunities presented to me here in Canada. Here's to sharing....</p>
<p><strong>Where will your donations go?</strong></p>
<p>There are 4 goals we are hoping to acheive.</p>
<p>1) Fly to Uganda so that we can analyze the programs, facilities, the training and the experience that a child has when they become a part of the Mankindye Soccer Academy.  We believe this is the main reason for going; so that we can offer the coaches and staff more education, up-to-date research on fitness practices and coaching materials to better support the children longterm.</p>
<p>2) ""WE GOT SKILLZ"" - We wish to develop an annual ""creative"" tournament so that this endeavor continues to bear fruit annually.  An injection of funds does very little longterm if there is no follow-up.  We want this to be an event that continues to give back for years to come.</p>
<p>3)Resources.  The academy plays host to over 100 children from 6 to 20yrs old. Knowing children you'll know that few things last very long in their hands. Your donations will go to buy new equipment from local businesses in Uganda.</p>
<p>4)Facilities.  This project is being run entirely by donation. Any extra money from this campaign will go into a longterm fund designed to help erect a local sports facility so that work can be done on the ground in Uganda.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Nearly 40% of Ugandans live on less than $1.25/day so most of the help is going to come from generous people such as yourself. Every dollar helps!</p>

<h3><strong>YOU GET... </strong></h3>
<p>For every donation we will give you a tax receipt from Bavubuka Foundation Charitable organization, and with each level of donation you get a cooler and cooler prize.  &lt;&lt;See them under Perks of sponsorship.&gt;&gt;</p>

<h2>Hey there! I'm Jake Bellavance and this is my fundraiser</h2>
<p>I'm 18 years old, and am raising money for the next major chapter of my life. This chapter includes an 11 month long trip to New Zealand to volunteer in a school with the organization Lattitude! Just to give you a little more knowledge of myself, I'm a West coast Canadian who was raised on a little island known as Salt Spring and now currently am an undergraduate at Capilano University in Vancouver studying social justice with the hopes of becoming a teacher of english or arts.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the organization! <a href=""http://www.lattitudecanada.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lattitudecanada.org/</a></p>
<h3><strong>Why am I fundraising and why so little time?</strong></h3>
<p>As for what my goal is and why it's so close even though I leave in July, I've found out just how expensive travel is, as my flights are quite expensive. I have to raise enough money for my flights to New Zealand by February or I can't go on the trip at all as I need to confirm my spot. So I have to raise ~$2,000 in  only about 2 months! Even with my mom having paid the ~$3,000 for the rest of the trip. Of course, I shall be looking for a job to help take off some of the pressure of fund raising, but being in school it's definitely hard to raise so much money in such a short period of time! So every donation means the absolute world to me as each dollar brings me closer to my dreams of teaching, traveling and living in New Zealand. If I happen to go over the fundraising goal (which would be miraculous) it would go towards filling my two month break (schools closed for summer break) with fun activities!</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>
<p>If you can't donate any money or if you want to do more, I'm always looking for advice on what other things I need for travelling, what to do in New Zealand, old travel books or even just support!</p>
<h2><strong>Thanks for reading about my fundraiser!</strong></h2>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Mira. I am 14 years old and I come from a family of four kids.  Last year, my parents had enough money to send my to a gifted and talented camp that changed my life. This year, it is not the same story. It is an expensive camp, but I am willing to do anything it takes. It is a program that you go to for 3 weeks and choose a course to study, and I applied and even got in with my first choice of class. All I'm missing is the money...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The minimum amount I would raise is $2000 (half of the camp tuition).</p>
<p>I would then be able to spend 3 weeks on a college campus, learning and meeting new people (as well as seeing all of my close friends from last year). </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Well, let's put it this way:</p>
<p>My generation is the future of the world. What's more important than educating the future? This camp is without a doubt the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I would do anything to relive it this summer. </p>

<h3>If you are interested, here is a short essay about my experience (written for a high school <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">application): </span>
</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>
<p>Out of experiences that I’ve had in my life, the most memorable has been a Duke TIP Summer Studies Program that I attended in June. I qualified for it by taking the SAT and getting a good score. I remember not wanting to go at first, but my parents convinced me that I should. I filled out a roommate questionnaire and sent in my class request form. I later found out that I got my first choice of class (Shakespeare/Acting).</p>
<p>On departure day, I asked myself questions like <em>What if kids in my class are smarter than me? What if my teacher’s mean? What if my roommate doesn’t like me?</em> I got so sad that I broke down in tears; I couldn’t believe I was going away for three weeks. After a plane ride that felt very long, I got to North Carolina. I was greeted by a counselor from the camp and joined a group of kids who were also going to the Davidson College campus, where the camp was being held.</p>
<p>I remember seeing the place for the first time, unaware of how familiar I’d become with it. I got to my room, where my roommate was already unpacking. That night I met my RC group (like a “bunk,” but we lived in different rooms, in the same hallway).  I was super quiet at first, but I quickly became comfortable around them.</p>
<p>During my first class, we introduced ourselves, not knowing that in just a week we’d have more inside jokes than we can count on two hands! Spending 7 hours each day in class, we formed tight bonds and even hung out together during free time. We were known as the “Shakespeareans” and were often heard around campus singing our famous cheers and songs. Our teachers (one main instructor and an assistant) were more laid back and fun than I’d expected. My knowledge of Shakespeare and my acting techniques improved and I had fun learning and performing monologues, dialogues, and scenes with peers.  At the end of each class, our instructor Ryan made a short speech known as his “spiel.” Sometimes it’d be funny, sometimes it’d teach us a life lesson, but it always left us with something to think about.</p>
<p>In a short time, I was friends with my RC group, my class, and even people who I’d met in the dining hall, at evening activities, or through other friends.  I was closer to my new friends than I was to most people at home that I’d known for years. I could tell them anything and I wasn’t afraid to be myself completely. For the first time in a long time, I was in an environment where everybody had their own interests, thinking processes, and favorite things. They came from different backgrounds and were intelligent and unique. There was no peer pressure and no desire to be like anyone else.  But most importantly, everyone was excepted. Nobody was made fun of or afraid to be themselves. Sure, we all had our closest group of friends, but we were a big family- I was never alone.</p>
<p>The routine of each day became like second nature, and my love for the place and people grew more all the time. As we neared the last week of camp, I realized that I’d be home soon. We got our end-of-term shirts, went to our last Friday night dance, and received our termbooks (like a yearbook, with everyone’s RC group and class pages). During our last class, Ryan made his final spiel about living for the moment. While we all got emotional, he talked to us about how memories can never be relived. “Even if we meet here again next year,” he said, “and I teach you the exact same things, it won’t be the same. You need to cherish every experience and every moment that you get, because that is the first and last one of its kind.” He told us how much he’d miss us, and how we’d been a  pleasure to teach. In tears, we said our final goodbyes to him and that concluded our last class.</p>
<p>The next day, I was leaving early in the morning, so I wouldn’t have the chance to say goodbye to friends. But to my surprise, I heard  knocks on my door at 6:30am. I opened up, and there stood my RC group and a few friends from class. Most of them were in tears like I was. I couldn’t believe that they’d woken up so early to say bye to me. I hugged each of them as long as I could before I had to go downstairs and sign out. In disbelief that it was over, I recalled the day I walked into the same building for the first time. I didn’t want leave.</p>
<p>At Duke TIP, I learned more than I thought I would, and had more fun than I thought I could. Not only had my knowledge and acting developed, but I gained things that I can take with me wherever I go. I learned  to make new friends, how to form bonds with my teachers, and even how to play a few new sports. Most importantly, however, I learned what it feels like to be accepted and loved by a group of people in which everyone is a unique personality, and how to live every moment to the fullest. Leaving TIP was even more emotional than leaving home, and I want to go back in future summers. I found lifelong friends, had unforgettable experiences, and realized what it’s like to be myself- these are things that can’t be taught, but Duke TIP found a way…</p>

<h3>The project <strong>(italiano sotto) </strong>
</h3>
<h3>House of Dreaming</h3>
<p>We had text prepared for this fundraiser. In light of the events of the past few weeks we are revisiting that text. What can we say? We mourn all the unnecessary loss of life. We mourn the children who will never get to grow up or who will grow up without a mother or father. We mourn the children who are being traumatized and terrorized on a daily basis.  We try to feel hopeful for the future of the children and the people of the land. And we feel the strong need for grassroots projects that give children the space to be kids and to be heard.</p>
<p>It has been a difficult few weeks and a difficult year for everyone and particularly difficult for the children of the West Bank, given the political situation in the region. Bethany (Al-Elzariya) is a town in the West Bank cut off from East Jerusalem by a separation wall. Disputes over land and other social problems also threaten the village’s social fabric. (For more information on Bethany see link at the bottom.)</p>
<p>In June 2019 we raised funds for a 10-day summer camp in Beit Jala (West Bank). The camp was such a huge success that we decided to try again. This summer we will bring together 30 children from the Beit Jala and Bethany area for one month. Our aim is to create a safe and creative environment for the children to play and heal.  Using the methods of non-violent communication (NVC), we remind children of their basic communication tools focusing on feelings and needs, self-expression and finding healthy strategies to meet those needs, teaching life skills for reaching across differences, resolving conflicts, and building long-lasting, meaningful connections. There will be a strong focus on contact with nature, which we believe is crucial to healthy development and mental health. We will also focus on community building by involving mothers and even grandmothers in some of our activities, which we hope will help build stronger connections with each other and with their children/grandchildren.</p>
<p><br/>Activities include: camping, nature walks, cooking, pottery, theatre, planting, art, movement, well-being/NVC activities<br/>The children will be provided with a healthy, fresh meal and snack every day. Some meals will be provided by the project and some will be prepared by parents as a way for them to contribute and feel connected to the project.</p>
<p>Program start date : c. 28 June 2021</p>
<p>Duration : 1 month</p>
<p>Who : 30 children aged 9-16 (from Al-Eizariya, SOS village Palestine, Dheisheh camp, Enad theatre) The older kids will start to build skills as youth leaders and help to look after the younger kids. Children from different communities will be brought together</p>
<p>Staff : Psychologist, social worker, expert in building youth programs, NVC facilitator. Staff will meet for a half hour debriefing at the end of each day (what went well/what didn’t go well arising issues, children who may need more guidance/attention)</p>
<p>Budget:  Approximately 13,200 euros for 30 children. Approximately 400/child for the full period or 100/week/child</p>

<p>Il progetto: House of Dreaming</p>
<p>Avevamo preparato un testo per questa raccolta fondi. Alla luce degli eventi della scorsa settimana, stiamo rivisitando quel testo. Cosa possiamo dire? Piangiamo tutte le inutili perdite di vite umane. Piangiamo i bambini che non cresceranno mai o che cresceranno senza una madre o un padre. Piangiamo i bambini che vengono traumatizzati e terrorizzati ogni giorno. Cerchiamo di contnuare di sperare nel futuro dei bambini e della gente del paese</p>
<p>Sono state settimane difficili e un anno difficile per tutti e particolarmente difficile per i bambini della Cisgiordania, vista la situazione politica nella regione. Bethany (Al-Elzariya) è una città della Cisgiordania isolata da Gerusalemme Est da un muro di separazione. Conflitto sulla terra e altri problemi sociali minacciano il tessuto sociale del paese. (Per ulteriori informazioni su Bethany vedere il link in fondo.)</p>
<p>Nel giugno 2019 abbiamo raccolto fondi per un campo estivo di 10 giorni a Beit Jala (Cisgiordania). Il campo è stato un così grande successo che abbiamo deciso di riprovare. Quest'estate riuniremo per un mese 30 bambini di diversi background della zona di Beit Jala e Betania. Il nostro obiettivo è creare un ambiente sicuro e creativo in cui i bambini possano giocare e guarire. Utilizzando i metodi della comunicazione non violenta (CNV), ricordiamo ai bambini i loro strumenti di comunicazione di base concentrandosi sui sentimenti e sui bisogni, sull'espressione di sé e sulla ricerca di strategie sane per soddisfare tali bisogni, insegnando le abilità di vita per superare le differenze, risolvere i conflitti e costruire connessioni significative e durature. Ci sarà una forte attenzione al contatto con la natura, che riteniamo fondamentale per uno sviluppo sano e per la salute mentale. Ci concentreremo anche sulla costruzione della comunità coinvolgendo madri e persino nonne in alcune delle nostre attività, che speriamo contribuiranno a costruire legami più forti tra loro e con i loro figli / nipoti</p>
<p>Le attività includono: campeggio, passeggiate nella natura, cucina, ceramiche, teatro, piantagione, arte, movimento, benessere / attività CNV</p>
<p>Ai bambini verrà fornito ogni giorno un pasto sano e fresco e uno spuntino. Alcuni pasti saranno forniti dal progetto e alcuni saranno preparati dai genitori come un modo per loro di contribuire e sentirsi connessi al progetto</p>
<p>Data di inizio del programma: c. 28 giugno 2021</p>
<p>Durata: 1 mese</p>

House of Dreaming
We had text prepared for this fundraiser. In light of the events of the past few weeks we are revisiting that text. What can we say? We mourn all the unnecessary loss of life. We mourn the children who will never get to grow up or who will grow up without a mother or father. We mourn the children who are being traumatized and terrorized on a daily basis.  We try to feel hopeful for the future of the children and the people of the land. And we feel the strong need for grassroots projects that give children the space to be kids and to be heard.
It has been a difficult few weeks and a difficult year for everyone and particularly difficult for the children of the West Bank, given the political situation in the region. Bethany (Al-Elzariya) is a town in the West Bank cut off from East Jerusalem by a separation wall. Disputes over land and other social problems also threaten the village’s social fabric. (For more information on Bethany see link at the bottom.)
In June 2019 we raised funds for a 10-day summer camp in Beit Jala (West Bank). The camp was such a huge success that we decided to try again. This summer we will bring together 30 children from the Beit Jala and Bethany area for one month. Our aim is to create a safe and creative environment for the children to play and heal.  Using the methods of non-violent communication (NVC), we remind children of their basic communication tools focusing on feelings and needs, self-expression and finding healthy strategies to meet those needs, teaching life skills for reaching across differences, resolving conflicts, and building long-lasting, meaningful connections. There will be a strong focus on contact with nature, which we believe is crucial to healthy development and mental health. We will also focus on community building by involving mothers and even grandmothers in some of our activities, which we hope will help build stronger connections with each other and with their children/grandchildren.
Activities include: camping, nature walks, cooking, pottery, theatre, planting, art, movement, well-being/NVC activitiesThe children will be provided with a healthy, fresh meal and snack every day. Some meals will be provided by the project and some will be prepared by parents as a way for them to contribute and feel connected to the project.
Program start date : c. 28 June 2021
Duration : 1 month
Who : 30 children aged 9-16 (from Al-Eizariya, SOS village Palestine, Dheisheh camp, Enad theatre) The older kids will start to build skills as youth leaders and help to look after the younger kids. Children from different communities will be brought together
Staff : Psychologist, social worker, expert in building youth programs, NVC facilitator. Staff will meet for a half hour debriefing at the end of each day (what went well/what didn’t go well arising issues, children who may need more guidance/attention)
Budget:  Approximately 13,200 euros for 30 children. Approximately 400/child for the full period or 100/week/child

Il progetto: House of Dreaming
Avevamo preparato un testo per questa raccolta fondi. Alla luce degli eventi della scorsa settimana, stiamo rivisitando quel testo. Cosa possiamo dire? Piangiamo tutte le inutili perdite di vite umane. Piangiamo i bambini che non cresceranno mai o che cresceranno senza una madre o un padre. Piangiamo i bambini che vengono traumatizzati e terrorizzati ogni giorno. Cerchiamo di contnuare di sperare nel futuro dei bambini e della gente del paese
Sono state settimane difficili e un anno difficile per tutti e particolarmente difficile per i bambini della Cisgiordania, vista la situazione politica nella regione. Bethany (Al-Elzariya) è una città della Cisgiordania isolata da Gerusalemme Est da un muro di separazione. Conflitto sulla terra e altri problemi sociali minacciano il tessuto sociale del paese. (Per ulteriori informazioni su Bethany vedere il link in fondo.)
Nel giugno 2019 abbiamo raccolto fondi per un campo estivo di 10 giorni a Beit Jala (Cisgiordania). Il campo è stato un così grande successo che abbiamo deciso di riprovare. Quest'estate riuniremo per un mese 30 bambini di diversi background della zona di Beit Jala e Betania. Il nostro obiettivo è creare un ambiente sicuro e creativo in cui i bambini possano giocare e guarire. Utilizzando i metodi della comunicazione non violenta (CNV), ricordiamo ai bambini i loro strumenti di comunicazione di base concentrandosi sui sentimenti e sui bisogni, sull'espressione di sé e sulla ricerca di strategie sane per soddisfare tali bisogni, insegnando le abilità di vita per superare le differenze, risolvere i conflitti e costruire connessioni significative e durature. Ci sarà una forte attenzione al contatto con la natura, che riteniamo fondamentale per uno sviluppo sano e per la salute mentale. Ci concentreremo anche sulla costruzione della comunità coinvolgendo madri e persino nonne in alcune delle nostre attività, che speriamo contribuiranno a costruire legami più forti tra loro e con i loro figli / nipoti
Le attività includono: campeggio, passeggiate nella natura, cucina, ceramiche, teatro, piantagione, arte, movimento, benessere / attività CNV
Ai bambini verrà fornito ogni giorno un pasto sano e fresco e uno spuntino. Alcuni pasti saranno forniti dal progetto e alcuni saranno preparati dai genitori come un modo per loro di contribuire e sentirsi connessi al progetto
Data di inizio del programma: c. 28 giugno 2021
Durata: 1 mese
Chi: 30 bambini di età compresa tra 9 e 16 anni (da Al-Eizariya, SOS Village Palestine, Dheisheh camp, Enad theatre) I ragazzi più grandi inizieranno a sviluppare abilità come punti di riferimento nei confronti dei più piccoli e aiuteranno a prendersi cura di questi ultimi.. I bambini delle comunità musulmane / cristiane saranno riuniti
Personale: psicologo, assistente sociale, esperto nella costruzione di programmi per i giovani, facilitatore CNV. Il personale si incontrerà per un debriefing di mezz'ora alla fine di ogni giornata (cosa è andato bene / cosa non è andato bene/ problemi derivanti, bambini che potrebbero aver bisogno di maggiore guida / attenzione)

<h3>Welcome to the AMYLA St. Thomas Expedition Campaign!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The <b>Adams Morgan Youth Leadership Academy (AMYLA)</b> was founded in 2008 to fill the gap we observed for a much-needed community program that was geared towards interacting and collaborating with the local youth population in the Washington DC neighborhoods of Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights; more specifically those who are living in low income housing and may not have access to other programs. AMYLA  primarily acts as a after school center and youth enrichment hub, focused on working with <b>adolescents and young adults between the ages of 13 and 21.</b></p>
<p>AMYLA  provides these youth with events and services such as community service initiatives that create more positive social infrastructures in their neighborhoods and sponsorship programs that bring in internships, mentorships, and career training seminars to provide them access to resources and guidance that lays the foundation for that skill set that ensures professional and personal success!</p>
<p>With your help, <b>this July we will send 12- 15 AMYLA youths, </b>most of whom have never left the country, and four of our staff members on a <b>five day cultural expedition to St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands!</b> Even though St. Thomas is a territory of the United States, the island has always maintained an individually rich culture; unique in  languages, food, history, and music among many other aspects! While on the island, AMYLA will collaborate with the Lybia's Daughter Organization to facilitate visits to historic sites such as forts and sugar plantations, travel to the mountains and agricultural zones of the island, take a day trip to the island of St. John, participate in bonding/team-building exercises, visit an underwater aquarium, meet with government officials, and much much more. With the success of this campaign this will be the sixth time that AMYLA has had the pleasure of sending youth abroad. We want to keep our momentum going and make this the best trip yet, so any and all support puts us that much closer to our goal!</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>The full amount that AMYLA needs for the summer expedition is <b>$15,000</b>. We have been able to raise <b>$5,000</b> towards the trip, so the purpose of this campaign is to raise the remaining <b>2/3</b> we need to make it a reality! : <b>$10,000</b> </div>

</div></div>","#30Days of ThanksgivingLO 
You may not know this about me, but I had the AMAZING opportunity to go through a program called Legal Outreach in high school. Legal Outreach works with students from underserved neighborhoods around NYC and prepares them to succeed in high school, college, and beyond.  
I'm fundraising this November to make it possible for more students like me to go through Legal Outreach. 
My Story  
My name is Shakiva Wade and I grew up in the Bronx. I went to Frederick Douglass Academy for high school. 
With LO's help, I went to Brandeis University as a Posse Scholar. 
Because of Legal Outreach, I was encouraged to apply for Posse and went to Brandeis on a full-tuition scholarship. LO sparked my interest in the law beginning with the Mock Trial back in 8th grade. I was inspired to go to law school and I am now an attorney. 


I am currently the Community Law and Education Coordinator at Legal Outreach, and I am grateful to start my legal career at the place that gave me my start. I hope to pursue a career in education law and children's rights in the future. 
Your support can change the lives of more students like me!
Your Support Will... 


Make it possible for more students like me to go through Legal Outreach for four years of free programming, including a debate program, SAT prep, writing classes, mentoring, college application workshops, and much more! 
Of the students LO supports: 


100% graduated HS on time (only 66% of NYC public school students do) 
99% went on to colleges and universities 




Other Ways You Can Help 


Donate to my campaign before December 2nd, 2014 
Share my campaign on social media 
Encourage your networks to support my campaign 


I'm thankful for LO and I'm thankful for your support!

<p>We are a small company located in the littlest state of Rhode Island USA!  Smaller than some ranches in Texas, but big in spirit.  We take our energy from the great college community here and the can do attitude of the typical New Englander!</p>
<p>Formed as a separate company from Cogent Computer Systems, Inc, we have been designing, developing and manufacturing sophisticated Microprocessor based products since 1992. In 2015 we formed Pi 2 Design in order to bring our expertise to the rapidly growing deployment of the Raspberry PI and other low cost SBC's into the embedded and home markets.  We also formed two brand names, PI2MEDIA and PI2EMBEDDED to show our support for these two great areas of application.  Our first product, the PI2EMBEDDED 502SSD Multi-Function shield was successfully funded on Kickstarter and is currently shipping to backers as we speak. The feedback we have already received has been very positive:</p>

<p>Hi, welcome to my Indiegogo campaign
for me to study abroad in Berlin for the summer 2015 through New York
University’s Tisch School of Arts Multimedia Projects Workshop. My name is
<b>Joshan</b>, as if I am just <b>“joshing”</b> with you, but not really, because it is
actually my name! </p>As a Film &amp; TV Production
major at the University School of Cinematic Arts, I have the opportunity to
expand my knowledge of filmmaking by working with other students from the top
rated program at NYU. As a junior, I have been pondering whether I will work in
the U.S.A. or abroad after graduation. With the opportunity to Study Abroad in
the summer of 2015, I will have the opportunity to feel what it is like to live
in a different country for an extended period.<br/><br/><p>The tuition, room &amp; board to
attend USC are approximately $65,000.00/year. In addition, the film and video
production courses taken require substantial additional expenses beyond
tuition. These expenses include lab fees for the course, stockroom cards, which
must be purchased for using the School’s equipment, editing and camera supplies
which each student must buy, and miscellaneous expenses such as props, gas for
driving to locations, food for actors, and so on. </p>
<p>And, I’m not “joshing” you. It
cost a great deal of money to attend USC and major in Film &amp; TV Production.
So, no pun intended based upon my name. I need your help raising <b>$20,000.00</b>!</p>
<p>My drive and commitment to excellence are exactly
the characteristics I believe are sought-after for Hollywood’s success. I
find adventure under every rock and use this grand sense of exploration to
influence my filmmaking. I understand that the best films come from a
filmmaker’s personal experiences. I desire to make fun and captivating movies
and believe this comes from the filmmaker’s ability to have fun and experience
life. On my deathbed one day, I would like to be able to smile pleasantly
knowing I lived life to the fullest. I feel that by helping me study abroad, you will
be <b>making an investment in building and shaping a future leader</b>.</p>
<h4><br/></h4><h4>About the Program - Multimedia Projects Workshop</h4>
<p>With a young, creative population and an energetic,
cosmopolitan art scene, Berlin has been enjoying a unique artistic revival that
celebrates multimedia projects and unconventional spaces.  Students will have the opportunity to explore
the city and to develop multimedia projects. The program features two
complementary courses: Creative Computing and Live Video Performance Art. </p>
<p>From fine art to computer programming, from live
performance to animation, this workshop has applications across
disciplines.  There are no prerequisites,
and the program welcomes students from all areas: e.g., film, music, computer
science, dance, theater, fine art, multimedia, graphic design, performance art,
photography etc.</p>
<p>(<a href=""http://specialprograms.tisch.nyu.edu/object/berlinworkshop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Source</a>)  <br/></p><br/><h4>Program Curriculum</h4>
<p>Students will enroll in the following two courses
for a total of 8 units.</p>
<p><b>Live Video
Performance Art</b></p>
<p>This course will combine a history of video art and
experimental film with practical training in the use of live video performance
art technology. Students will explore new ways to create and edit films and
videos using VJ software, projections, and multi-channel video surfaces.
Workshops will demonstrate concepts and software that can be integrated into
the creative process of video performance art and video art installations.
Drawing inspiration from the recent history of video and multi-media artists,
students will use live VJ software to manipulate digital media in real time as
well as projection mapping techniques to project video art onto 3D surfaces in
order to create original video art, video installations, and other performance
pieces.</p>
<p><b>Creative
Computing</b></p>
<p>What can computation add to human communication and
creativity? Creating applications, instead of just using them, gives a us
deeper understanding of the possibilities. Creating projects that you are
excited about and invested in, whether the domain of art, design, performance,
humanities, sciences, or engineering is the best way to learn the skills needed
to realize those ideas. This course will begin with the expressive capabilities
of the human body and how we experience our physical environment. The physical
computing skills learned in this portion of the course will allow you to go
past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard, and monitor interface to build
your own, perhaps more expressive interfaces. The platform for the class is a
micro-controller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer
that can be embedded anywhere to both sense and create action in the physical
world. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of programming
as well as more advanced techniques such as animation, image manipulation and
processing, projection mapping, and computer vision. The Java-based
‘Processing’ programming environment is the primary vehicle that will be in
use. Processing itself is oriented towards displays but can also connect back
to the physical sensors and controllers from the first part of the class in
order to create more applications with more expressive interfaces. The course
is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered nature of
it allows for more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with
their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.</p>

<h4><br/></h4><h4>Insight into Joshan</h4>
<p>The main crux of my producing
goals is to provide proper representation for marginalized people through the
power of cinema. This can range from producing content such like “Selma” or “12
Years A Slave” that shares the stories of the oppressed and a truer look of the
past that is often romanticized. </p>
<p>However, I am also very
interested in going a step further than that, and placing oppressed people in
roles that are usually given to the privileged. For example, a black Indiana
Jones or a Muslim woman being James Bond or a transgender Superman. These roles
are traditionally given to people who fit the criteria for the most privileged
of society. That being straight, white men. The roles of women are usually
there only to advance the character development of the male protagonist or
could easily be traded out for with a lamp. 
The roles given to people of color, LGBT individuals, or people with
disabilities are steeped in negative and damaging stereotypes that turn this
marginalized group into a joke. Or, their roles are completely nonexistent. I
want to change the traditional casting that exists in the entertainment
industry.</p>
<p>My immediate goals are to produce
projects at USC where proper representation is given. Sure, the audiences of
these projects are small. However, the main audience would be my classmates who
are trying to go into the entertainment industry. By educating, those about
proper representation will make them more socially conscious filmmakers. They
will move up the ranks of the entertainment industry with a ground firm base of
socially awareness and will reach positions in the future where they understand
that the past practices of Hollywood are unacceptable. </p>
<p>I also desire to build a network
of filmmakers and artists of other mediums who are already educated on social
issues and share similar goals or proper representation. By building this

teaching them racism, sexism, and homophobia and a slew of other ideas that will
be internalized in the minds of children. By putting a higher standard on what

<p></p></div>","Hi, welcome to my Indiegogo campaign
for me to study abroad in Berlin for the summer 2015 through New York
University’s Tisch School of Arts Multimedia Projects Workshop. My name is
Joshan, as if I am just “joshing” with you, but not really, because it is
actually my name! As a Film & TV Production
major at the University School of Cinematic Arts, I have the opportunity to
expand my knowledge of filmmaking by working with other students from the top
rated program at NYU. As a junior, I have been pondering whether I will work in
the U.S.A. or abroad after graduation. With the opportunity to Study Abroad in
the summer of 2015, I will have the opportunity to feel what it is like to live
in a different country for an extended period.The tuition, room & board to
attend USC are approximately $65,000.00/year. In addition, the film and video
production courses taken require substantial additional expenses beyond
tuition. These expenses include lab fees for the course, stockroom cards, which
must be purchased for using the School’s equipment, editing and camera supplies
which each student must buy, and miscellaneous expenses such as props, gas for
driving to locations, food for actors, and so on. 
And, I’m not “joshing” you. It
cost a great deal of money to attend USC and major in Film & TV Production.
So, no pun intended based upon my name. I need your help raising $20,000.00!
My drive and commitment to excellence are exactly
the characteristics I believe are sought-after for Hollywood’s success. I
find adventure under every rock and use this grand sense of exploration to
influence my filmmaking. I understand that the best films come from a
filmmaker’s personal experiences. I desire to make fun and captivating movies
and believe this comes from the filmmaker’s ability to have fun and experience
life. On my deathbed one day, I would like to be able to smile pleasantly
knowing I lived life to the fullest. I feel that by helping me study abroad, you will
be making an investment in building and shaping a future leader.
About the Program - Multimedia Projects Workshop
With a young, creative population and an energetic,
cosmopolitan art scene, Berlin has been enjoying a unique artistic revival that
celebrates multimedia projects and unconventional spaces.  Students will have the opportunity to explore
the city and to develop multimedia projects. The program features two
complementary courses: Creative Computing and Live Video Performance Art. 
From fine art to computer programming, from live
performance to animation, this workshop has applications across
disciplines.  There are no prerequisites,
and the program welcomes students from all areas: e.g., film, music, computer
science, dance, theater, fine art, multimedia, graphic design, performance art,
photography etc.
(Source)  Program Curriculum
Students will enroll in the following two courses
for a total of 8 units.
Live Video
Performance Art
This course will combine a history of video art and
experimental film with practical training in the use of live video performance
art technology. Students will explore new ways to create and edit films and
videos using VJ software, projections, and multi-channel video surfaces.
Workshops will demonstrate concepts and software that can be integrated into
the creative process of video performance art and video art installations.
Drawing inspiration from the recent history of video and multi-media artists,
students will use live VJ software to manipulate digital media in real time as
well as projection mapping techniques to project video art onto 3D surfaces in
order to create original video art, video installations, and other performance
pieces.
Creative
Computing
What can computation add to human communication and
creativity? Creating applications, instead of just using them, gives a us
deeper understanding of the possibilities. Creating projects that you are
excited about and invested in, whether the domain of art, design, performance,
humanities, sciences, or engineering is the best way to learn the skills needed
to realize those ideas. This course will begin with the expressive capabilities
of the human body and how we experience our physical environment. The physical
computing skills learned in this portion of the course will allow you to go
past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard, and monitor interface to build
your own, perhaps more expressive interfaces. The platform for the class is a
micro-controller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer
that can be embedded anywhere to both sense and create action in the physical
world. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of programming
as well as more advanced techniques such as animation, image manipulation and
processing, projection mapping, and computer vision. The Java-based
‘Processing’ programming environment is the primary vehicle that will be in
use. Processing itself is oriented towards displays but can also connect back
to the physical sensors and controllers from the first part of the class in
order to create more applications with more expressive interfaces. The course
is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered nature of
it allows for more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with
their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.

Insight into Joshan
The main crux of my producing
goals is to provide proper representation for marginalized people through the
power of cinema. This can range from producing content such like “Selma” or “12
Years A Slave” that shares the stories of the oppressed and a truer look of the
past that is often romanticized. 
However, I am also very
interested in going a step further than that, and placing oppressed people in
roles that are usually given to the privileged. For example, a black Indiana
Jones or a Muslim woman being James Bond or a transgender Superman. These roles
are traditionally given to people who fit the criteria for the most privileged
of society. That being straight, white men. The roles of women are usually
there only to advance the character development of the male protagonist or
could easily be traded out for with a lamp. 
The roles given to people of color, LGBT individuals, or people with
disabilities are steeped in negative and damaging stereotypes that turn this
marginalized group into a joke. Or, their roles are completely nonexistent. I
want to change the traditional casting that exists in the entertainment
industry.
My immediate goals are to produce
projects at USC where proper representation is given. Sure, the audiences of
these projects are small. However, the main audience would be my classmates who
are trying to go into the entertainment industry. By educating, those about
proper representation will make them more socially conscious filmmakers. They
will move up the ranks of the entertainment industry with a ground firm base of
socially awareness and will reach positions in the future where they understand
that the past practices of Hollywood are unacceptable. 
I also desire to build a network
of filmmakers and artists of other mediums who are already educated on social
issues and share similar goals or proper representation. By building this
stronghold, we can venture into the industry, hand in hand, fighting the good
fight to fix the wrongs of the media. 
My long-term goals are really
about maintaining proper representation in my work and all the projects I
desire to work. I want to work in children’s media because I feel that is the
area of the media where representation is most important. By including harmful
stereotypes and the lack of representation in children’s TV and movies, we are
teaching them racism, sexism, and homophobia and a slew of other ideas that will
be internalized in the minds of children. By putting a higher standard on what
we show our children will assure that events and situations, such like
Ferguson, will not happen because we will live in a world where the
privilege/oppression dichotomy is not taught to be the norm of how society
runs. 
I also want to give back! I want to create
infrastructure that allows more diverse creators to have their work shown. In
the current Hollywood system, it is rather difficult for creators who are not
straight white men to get the work recognized. I want to create a way for
anyone to be able to get their foot in the door so that they may color the
black and white vision of Hollywood!

 After the devastion caused by the earthquake that happened on Saturday 25th April, Nepal is in need of so many things urgently, People have asked me how they can help but they don't know which charities to donate their money to. 
 There are many good charities out there such as Oxfam and Red Cross, however if you would like to know exactly where you helping, please donate here!
     What We Need & What You Get This is what you get:  The promise that ALL donations given to the Nepal Earthquake Relief FUND will be going to different emergency relief projects, such as hospitals, woman and children support charities and  mental health projects.  


What we need: 

Initially we hope to raise £ 3000 and we will let you know what money is given to which project. We will be transparent and feel free to ask any questions about where your donations will be spend on. 
 One of our friends in Nepal, is sending money directly to two hospitals in Pokhara and we will give money to him so he can give it directly to the hospitals. 

Another friend is looking for tents through the GlobalMentalHealth project, we are hoping to provide these too. 
 Other projects might become part of this funding and we will certainly update you about this as soon as we know more ourselves. 
    The Impact By donation to this CAUSE your money will go directly to the people who need it! 
I have previously worked in Nepal with the people who are coordinating these different humanitarian projects we are hoping to support. We totally trust that your money will go to where it is needed most, such as hospitals, 
Your donation will make a direct impact on someones life so please give what you can!       Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to contribute,  that doesn't mean that you can't help:  Please get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Please use the Indiegogo share tools when you do! Thanks so much!

</div><p>For a Muse of Fire is a community theatre project led by theatre artist Luisa Jojic  involving and open to diverse individuals who live, work or study in 
Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside (DTES) including those who have 
experienced homelessness or are currently vulnerably housed.</p>
<p>The project is an opportunity for local residents to explore, learn, 
create and transform through the art of theatre. Participants will 
collaborate to create an original live performance piece to be performed
 at Vancouver Moving Theatre's <a href=""http://www.heartofthecityfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heart of the City Festival</a>
 (Oct-Nov 2015). It presents a counter narrative to the dominant 
portrayal of the DTES as a neighbourhood divided by income, culture and 
class, by bringing to light a fuller picture of the DTES as a place of 
strong community in which people learn from and support each other.</p>
<p>For a Muse of Fire builds on the success of Much Ado About SOMETHING,
 a pilot initiative led by Luisa Jojic in collaboration with RainCity 
Housing for Homelessness Action Week 2014. A group of 9 participants 
worked together to explore issues of class, equality, community and 
belonging, using Shakespeare's text as a starting point to create their 
own words and stories. The collaboratively created work was performed 
Oct 2014 at the Carnegie Centre, Waterfront Theatre, and Kwantlen Park 
Secondary School in Surrey.</p>

<p><span><span><b>The Steve Sinnott Foundation</b> was established in 2009 in the name of Steve Sinnott, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers of England and Wales.  Behind the headlines of his work as head of the NUT, Steve was an enthusiastic and active promoter of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for education (now updated to the Sustainable Development Goals). He often spoke of education as ‘the great liberator’ which provides a pathway out of poverty and despair. There are 55 million children still without access to quality education so there is still much more work to be done.

<p><span><b>Why tell personal stories?</b></span></p>
<p>Because they are more interesting.  They touch us, make us feel alive, and inspire us. They reflect our basic human need to understand each other, our cultures and how others see the world.  Stories are the way in which people reach out and emotionally connect with each other. Storytelling enables people to share their ideas and solutions and not feel alone.</p>

The Steve Sinnott Foundation was established in 2009 in the name of Steve Sinnott, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers of England and Wales.  Behind the headlines of his work as head of the NUT, Steve was an enthusiastic and active promoter of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for education (now updated to the Sustainable Development Goals). He often spoke of education as ‘the great liberator’ which provides a pathway out of poverty and despair. There are 55 million children still without access to quality education so there is still much more work to be done. You can find out more about The Steve Sinnott Foundation here www.stevesinnottfoundation.org.uk


Our film team
Lucy Lee graduated from the National Film & TV School, winning the Chicago Gold Hugo award amongst others, with her graduation film which she made in Russia. She has since made numerous other independent and commissioned films on a wide range of topics and in a wide range of styles, and won awards around the globe. You can see more of her work here www.instinctmedia.co.uk



Stelios Koupetoris has been nominated for his work, including Lucy Lee's ""Wasteland"" at the UK Music and Sound Awards, the Hollywood Music in Media Awards and has been awarded at the Garden State Film Festival, the Drama Film Festival and the Park City Film Music Festival among others. 

Nefeli Stamatogiannopoulou studied music at the Royal School of Music and acquired her Bachelor and MMus in Composition for Film, Theater and Performing Arts at the Ionian University of Greece. She collaborates with the renowned Grotowski Institute and composes for films and theatre. Nefeli is also the founder of the band ""Spooky RedRum"".

Louise Brown is an award winning sound editor and Foley artist. She has worked on films such as ""Moshi Monsters: The Movie"", ""Anuvahood"", ""Plastic"" and ""Tower Block"". Louise also enjoys working with young people to foster their creativity.

Why tell personal stories?
Because they are more interesting.  They touch us, make us feel alive, and inspire us. They reflect our basic human need to understand each other, our cultures and how others see the world.  Stories are the way in which people reach out and emotionally connect with each other. Storytelling enables people to share their ideas and solutions and not feel alone.


How will we find the stories?
From our work at the Foundation we meet many people who have compelling stories they want to share. As well as these, we are also asking people to send in their personal stories, and we'll be asking you, our community of supporters to vote for the best of all these stories. 


Why mini films?
Because they are infinitely viewable. Keeping it short keeps attention. Watch them and you can fill in the rest of the story.


What’s the money for?
Here’s the breakdown:          50% Animation and Editing          20% Music and Sound          10% Story Competition          20% Rewards and Resources, Indigogo fees





What are the Resources for Schools?
The films themselves, branded stationery to say thank you for fundraising, the booklet of stories, workshop resource packs.
What's in it for you?

You are actually the ones who are making this happen. You are adding to the EDUCATION FOR ALL movement. You are helping people share their stories, stories that can help and encourage others, stories that will help us understand each other. 

Education empowers people, gives people choices. It can create a different world, a better connected world, new opportunities for economic development and new hopes and aspirations for tens, maybe hundreds, of millions

Education, learning and knowledge are the proven
opponents of war and conflict. They provide opportunities to enable people
to escape from the deprivation which breeds anger and resentment, the cause of so
much conflict. 


Investing now in education is an investment in all our futures.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>I'm Miya David and I'm a reporter from the Philippines about to embark on the biggest thing to ever happen in my life.</p>
<p>I've been accepted to grad school in New York to study specialized journalism. It's been my biggest dream ever to study journalism and to do it in New York, arguably one of the centers of media, is quite possibly the best thing ever and I get to come back to my country and share what I learned.</p>
<p>But sadly, as an international student and a working journalist, I don't exactly have enough financial liquidity for grad school (collective *sigh*).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What for?</h2>
<p>The idea of this campaign is to help defray tuition.</p>
<p>I applied to several scholarships but since it's very competitive (and apparently my clout isn't as big as I thought), I haven't gotten any. But not to worry, I'm applying for several loans in the US which require me to have  US co-signer and local loans here in my country.</p>
<p>Also, several scholarships require me to be enrolled and applications start this December. And the lottery. Cross your fingers!</p>
<h3><strong>Let's break it down though.</strong></h3>
<p>The $15,000 I'm aiming for will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>One semester's worth of tuition which is $10,165</li>
<li>Supplement living expenses including rent, food and possibly the Macbook Pro I'm required to have</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What's gonna happen?</h2>
<h3>No really why should I give money to you?</h3>
<p>Like I said, this is probably the biggest thing ever for me.</p>
<p>I'm going to take up an <strong>MA in Journalism</strong> and I will be focusing on Arts Journalism using a multimedia platform.</p>
<p>Basically, what I want to do is report on the changing production of the arts. See, most people now get to enjoy something artistic like say a movie or a TV show if they download it. So how do we gauge its popularity? How do we report a certain movie's impact on people when most discussions happen not when people leave the theater but on the Internet. I want to be able to report on the many different ways people from different corners of the world come together through cultural products like movies, books, plays all through the Internet.</p>
<p>After grad school, I can practice what I learned in my country and hopefully inspire other media people to think critically about how the arts and artistic products are being enjoyed here.</p>

Finding Opportunities for our Tennis
Community
We seek to broaden children’s
experiences.  
In Chicago, we bring a bus filled
with eager tennis players to Winnetka and Homewood- Flossmoor, where local
clubs host professional and college tennis matches for our youth to watch.  The day is also filled with on-court tennis
activities, lunch, and a Q & A with nationally-ranked professional tennis
players.   
This year, we hope to build
traveling teams across both program sites in Chicago and Baltimore, where our
players train with local tennis professionals and play in beginner junior USTA tournaments.
Fundraising will allow us to
maintain current field trips and expand programming for our returning tennis
players.

<p>Help
us bring an innovative non-profit software company to Portland, and give our
adults on the autism spectrum hope through community, technology training, and
a safe work environment.</p>

It is important to open nonPareil Portland now because in
the United States, <b>approximately 90% of adults on the autism spectrum are
unemployed or underemployed and 70%
will be unable to live independently.</b> As a result, many families
are left with having to ask the tough questions: ""What will happen when the
school bus stops coming?"", ""What happens after high school?"", and<b> ""Who will take care of them when I'm
gone?""</b> Typically having limited
social skills, many autistic young adults find themselves isolated, lonely, and
generally not part of the community; this can often lead to high anxiety,
depression and a general feeling of unfulfillment.<br/><br/><p>In response, 
a program out of Texas called nonPareil (meaning
“no equal”), 
has developed a very unique model: it is a non-profit
software company, intent on employing individuals with ASD. NonPareil trains
students on the autism spectrum to develop, program, and design original video
games and apps for the marketplace.<b> By valuing each Crewmember’s distinct gifts and talents,
</b><span><b>nonPareil Institute engages interests
and provides students with creative and meaningful long-term work</b>, and the hope
of employment income based on their product sales.</span>
<b></b></p>
<p>

To generate initial
awareness for nonPareil Portland, marketing professor Justine Haigh and key
local stakeholders, partnered with George
Fox University to host a two-day gaming programming camp at George Fox
during the spring break of March 2014. The camp was a huge
success with many inspiring stories from everyone who was involved - <b>See for yourself, watch our
short game programming camp video! </b><a href=""http://vimeo.com/92096234"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/92096234</a></p>
<p>
The next step in launching <b>nonPareil Portland </b><b>is to raise </b><b>$10,000 in donations to fund </b><b>a
Programming Hope Portland Event</b>. You will have the opportunity to meet founders Dan
Selec and Gary Moore as well as the nonPareil
Portland team. You
will hear student success stories and family life-changing moments from
both Texas Crewmembers and those who recently attended the Portland game
programming camp. For those more interested in technology, there
will be programming demonstrations and exhibits of Crewmembers creative,
original designs (games and apps).
<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Our stretch goal is $160,000,</b> which will
allow us to open a local Portland office. With the additional funds, we will accelerate
our plans and open our first nP PDX permanent location <a href=""http://www.npitx.org/city/portland.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.npitx.org/city/portland.aspx</a></p><p><b><b>
<b>Please help us </b></b></b>by supporting our campaign and by spreading the
word about nP in general. Considering the great demand for this program nationally, it is such a privilege to
have the opportunity for nonPareil to come to Portland!

Nationally, autism diagnosis has reached an almost epidemic level. 
In March 2014, the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its most recent update on the
rates of autism in the United States. <b>The
statistics indicate that a rate of 1 out of 68 eight-year-old children are now
diagnosed with ASD.</b> <a href=""http://healthyliving.msn.com/diseases/autism/us-autism-estimates-rise-by-30-percent-for-kids-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://healthyliving.msn.com/diseases/autism/us-autism-estimates-rise-by-30-percent-for-kids-1</a></p>
<p>Given these
rates, a record number of autistic individuals are
about to enter the workforce, enroll in college, or look for adult services. nonPareil Institute, with its unique
methodology, has ‘changed the game’ in creating new
opportunities for people with autism. Dan Selec, software developer and father to an
autistic teenage son, started nonPareil at his kitchen table four
years ago with just a handful of students. <b>Today there </b><b>is great demand for places at nonPareil
Institute in Texas, with 150 students </b><b>currently in the program and over 1,000 who have applied for admission.<br/></b></p>
<p><b>nP</b><b> has been
featured in numerous reports and programs</b> including: Huffington Post, NPR, CNN, and NBC’s

Short Summary
There are over 10,000 entrepreneurship classrooms in the US, reaching over half a million students, but did you know that the vast majority of educators are teaching entrepreneurship from a textbook, rather than letting students experience it for themselves?   Teaching entrepreneurship should be a lot less like teaching accounting (theory based) and a lot more like teaching basketball (hands on practice).  My name is Diana Kander. I am an entrepre.nerd and a Senior Fellow at the Kauffman Foundation.  I've written a novel about the trials and tribulations of starting a business and created an accompanying curriculum to get students out of the classroom to experience launching a new venture for themselves.  The book, All In Startup, takes place at the World Series of Poker and has more sexual tension than any business book you've ever read (meaning students will actually read it).  AND STUDENTS LOVE IT.  But don't take my word for it...see for yourself:And the curriculum is all about getting students out of the classroom to experience what entrepreneurship is like, even if they don't have an idea they want to pursue. Here are some sample student reactions to the curriculum:Kara:""For an activity as simple as handing dollar bills to random strangers, the challenge opened my eyes to the value of connecting with others. Even with all of the preparation I made beforehand, approaching people and convincing them to accept my gift was plain awkward. Just this one challenge has taught me that the hardest part of succeeding in business can be communicating with the potential targets of your product or service—the customers. By handing out free money, I wasn’t trying to sell anything, rather just aiming to complete my mission. I had to deal with people who were skeptical of my giving, some who kindly turned down the money, and others who flat-out ignored me. But if I were an entrepreneur trying to attract customers, I would have to deal with similar interactions.  Never before did I think of connecting with customers as being the most integral part to building a business. Frankly, my perspective has been flipped around and I’m thrilled to experience more through the challenges to come.""Sarah: “Simulating the beginning stages of a startup through the exercise taught me more about entrepreneurship than any of my lecture-based classes. I was able to actually practice selling and business techniques, which gave me a tangible understanding of what works and what doesn’t in the startup world.  The exercise was actually fun, and I learned so much. I am looking forward to (and slightly scared again) for the next challenge!""I'm trying to get the book and curriculum into the hands of each of those 10,000 professors in the hopes that they will use it to introduce experiential education - getting customers, finding problems worth solving, testing assumptions, etc - into their classroom.  Please help get these materials into as many classrooms as possible and help train the next generation of entrepreneurs with proven methodologies to improve their odds of success.Entrepreneurs like Tony Hsieh of Zappos and Steve Blank think this novel is an excellent representation of the entrepreneurial experience:Educators see a lot of value to applying the book and curriculum in the classroom:“There is seldom a read that when you start it, you can't put it down.  Diana Kander has crafted such an experience that fuses an engaging story of choices, dilemmas, tradeoffs, and problems with the real-world experience of the entrepreneur.  In a narrative that captures the culture and the spirit of an entrepreneur in a worthy tale of swagger, hustle and intuition, the reader will learn the lessons of the ""all in"" entrepreneur and build a framework to approach their own entrepreneurial pathway.  Before you know it, the lessons framed in the book become your own, to the extent that you will convince yourself you have always known them.  I've concluded that anyone who thinks they may want to take a crack at founding a business, should read ""All In"" first.” -Ted Zoller, Director, Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill_______________________________________________________________“This book should be required reading for anybody interested in entrepreneurship, from high school students to experienced entrepreneurs because, in contrast to the multitude of traditional, cookie-cutter textbooks on entrepreneurship, it conveys important concepts, and stages in the entrepreneurial process in an easy and entertaining way.We're using All In Startup as part of our curriculum at the University of Missouri - Kansas City because this book offers a different way of explaining the elements of a business model, how they work together in a coherent way and how to test the assumptions entrepreneurs make about all aspects of their business.” - Dirk Libaers - Professor of Entrepreneurship – University of Missouri - Kansas CityWhat We NeedIf you're an entrepreneur, buy a copy of All In Startup for yourself and your team. And, if you are feeling generous, please sponsor a school you care about to receive copies of the book and curriculum. If you wish your college taught more about talking to customers and less about writing business plans, support your alma mater by buying copies for a single class.If you're an entrepreneurship educator, buy a copy for your classroom and I'll work with you to help you implement All In Startup into your existing curriculum. 100% of the funds raised will either be used to send you perks or to send books and materials to as many educators as we can afford to contact.Our goal is to get over 1,000 entrepreneurs to sponsor the campaign so that the professors we contact understand that this is a real grassroots effort demonstrating the importance and value of experiential rather than theory based education.If you have a suggestion for additional perks that would entice you to give, we’re excited to hear your suggestions.More About the Book and Curriculum:All In Startup: Coming June 30, 2014 from Wiley. If Owen Chase doesn’t come up with a way to turn his company around in the next nine days, he will be forced to shut it down and lay off all of his employees.

</p><p>Hi, my name is Gerald and about
40 years ago, my mom and dad moved from the Bronx to buy their first home in
the city of Mount Vernon, New York. We were the first African-American family
to own a home on our block. For my parents and the four kids, it was an
exciting time and many great memories remain from those years and all the
wonderful things we all learned. </p>
<p>Forty years later, much has
changed of course, Mount Vernon is now the only major city in the state of New
York where a minority represents the majority with African-Americans at about
65% of the population. </p>
<p>Mount Vernon is a city of about
70,000 people and is the third largest city in Westchester County of just more
than 900,000 people. Westchester County includes some of our nation’s most
affluent communities including many that you may have heard of- Bronxville,
Scarsdale, and Pelham. </p>
<p>Unlike those locations, Mount
Vernon is known for having a higher crime rate, a higher poverty rate, and a
higher unemployment rate, some of the highest in the county and the state. </p>
<p>Mount Vernon has about 9000
students that attend its public schools, 97% of those children are children of
color- black or brown and slightly more than 40% of those children live at or
below the poverty level. </p>
<p>Most distressing, our
children’s science and math test scores confirm that these youngsters will not
be prepared to compete for middle-class enabling careers. One current result
that speaks strongly to our concerns is reflected in the fact that the high
school graduation rate is more than 20% lower than communities within walking
distance of Mount Vernon. </p>
<p>Our plans to drive meaningful
change include creating/building a technology and science center, an informal
learning environment that will provide our children with access to critical
resources that have proven to produce better outcomes including greater
interest in the sciences, better test performance and better graduation rates. </p>
<p>While we are working very hard
to raise the funds to build the 140,000 square foot center, we are also
delivering various programs for the children so that they will know of our
promise to make their lives and most importantly, their future better. The SECOND
program that we are providing is our free 6-Saturday STEM Program for 10<sup>th</sup>
&amp; 11<sup>th</sup> Grade girls attending any one of the three public high
schools in Mount Vernon. The program includes fours Saturday’s in November and two
Saturday’s in December. This program will provide an intense learning
experience with engaging, supportive learning that includes the young women
learning Coding and Entrepreneurship with a chance to win $2,500.00. Here is
more about the modules that will be included:</p>
<p><b>Coding with
Alice 2.0 </b></p>
<p>Alice
2.0 is an Object-Oriented Programing (OOP) tool used to engage students in the
basic concepts of programing without the need to teach advanced technological
semantics of programming. The goal of this course is to introduce students to
the basic functions of programing using an Alice 2.0 platform. With its project-oriented,
step-by-step instruction, students will easily grasp programming concepts and
build confidence in their skills. Students will learn through hands-on projects
how to create worlds, insert 3D objects and manipulate those objects in a 3D
environment. Themes are utilized to build interest and create a functional
storyline, as well as create intractable scenarios in an Alice environment. After
weekly class assignments are completed students will create short independent
projects which will highlight concepts learned during the weekly
assignments.<span>  Independent projects serve
a dual purpose which is to implement Alice concepts learned and to inspire
individual creativity. Computers will be needed to execute all class
assignments.  </span></p>
<p><b>Required Equipment: Computer</b> with a separate mouse, will be
provided.</p>
<p><b>Required Textbooks:</b> Gary Shelly, Thomas
Cashman, and Charles Herbert (2006), “Alice 2.0 Introductory Concepts and
Techniques. ISBN-10: 1-4188-5934-6 and ISBN-13: 978-1-4188-5934-3, will be
provided.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Start It UP! Entrepreneurship
Fundamentals </b></p>
<p>Do you dream of starting
your own business? Are you creative, innovative and eager to make a difference?</p>
<p>The entrepreneurship class will teach you the fundamentals of running
and starting a business – how to recognize an opportunity, identify your target
market, finance your business and promote it. As part of the entrepreneurship
class you will participate in the NFTE World Series of Innovation.<span>  Working together in</span> teams of at least two (2) and not more than five (5) you will select one
of the many Innovation challenges and come up with a new, unique, innovative
product or service to address the market niche. Your mission is to demonstrate
how the product or service will impact people's lives on a day-to-day basis.
Completed submissions are due by November 20, 2014, during Global
Entrepreneurship Week. A panel of judges will select the top 10 submissions in
each challenge category, each of whom will be given 4 weeks to film and create
the commercial for which they provided a story board and script. The two
winning teams in each category will receive a prize of $2,000 to share, and a
prize of $500 for their school or other non-profit youth serving organization.
Winning team members in the Microsoft Mobile App Design and Mobile Game Design
categories will each receive a Microsoft Student Productivity Suite (such as
Microsoft Office and Student) from Microsoft.</p>
<p>While we have been able to
raise some of the money to cover some of the cost, we need help to make it a
reality. Every dollar raised with be exclusively used to address the cost of
camp that includes all 25 young women from this at-risk, underserved population.</p>
<p>If you are able to give us
$25.00 or more and share this with your friends, we will reach our goal, please
help us and thank you for your kind consideration!</p>
<p>We invite you to be a part of
this important project to improve the lives of more than 9,000 public school
students in Mount Vernon, New York. The center will also serve as an invaluable
resource available to all children throughout the tri-state region. A detailed
business plan, preliminary architectural building designs, and additional
information are available at your request. Please see our website for more
information about the center and to learn of other ways that you can help us
drive change- <a href=""http://www.mvtsc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.mvtsc.org</u></a>. </p>
<p>PERKS</p>
<p>In addition to our sincere
thanks and appreciation, all that are able to give $25.00 or more will receive
our MVTSYCA T-Shirt. For gifts of $250.00 or more, we will add a free 1-year
Membership for you, a family member or friend that includes free access and a
15% discount on all products purchased at the center. For gifts of $500.00 or
more, we will make the membership and discounts of 20% include up to 4 people.
$1,000.00 or more in giving will include all the other perks plus we will also
add your name to our granite “Wall of Honor”, where it will remain. </p>

individual creativity. Computers will be needed to execute all class
assignments.  
Required Equipment: Computer with a separate mouse, will be
provided.
Required Textbooks: Gary Shelly, Thomas
Cashman, and Charles Herbert (2006), “Alice 2.0 Introductory Concepts and

Start It UP! Entrepreneurship
Fundamentals 
Do you dream of starting
your own business? Are you creative, innovative and eager to make a difference?
The entrepreneurship class will teach you the fundamentals of running
and starting a business – how to recognize an opportunity, identify your target
market, finance your business and promote it. As part of the entrepreneurship
class you will participate in the NFTE World Series of Innovation.  Working together in teams of at least two (2) and not more than five (5) you will select one
of the many Innovation challenges and come up with a new, unique, innovative
product or service to address the market niche. Your mission is to demonstrate
how the product or service will impact people's lives on a day-to-day basis.
Completed submissions are due by November 20, 2014, during Global
Entrepreneurship Week. A panel of judges will select the top 10 submissions in
each challenge category, each of whom will be given 4 weeks to film and create
the commercial for which they provided a story board and script. The two
winning teams in each category will receive a prize of $2,000 to share, and a
prize of $500 for their school or other non-profit youth serving organization.
Winning team members in the Microsoft Mobile App Design and Mobile Game Design
categories will each receive a Microsoft Student Productivity Suite (such as
Microsoft Office and Student) from Microsoft.
While we have been able to
raise some of the money to cover some of the cost, we need help to make it a
reality. Every dollar raised with be exclusively used to address the cost of
camp that includes all 25 young women from this at-risk, underserved population.

$25.00 or more and share this with your friends, we will reach our goal, please

<br/>We are Marian High School--a Catholic, college-preparatory school for young women sponsored by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. </p>
<p>We are students, families, faculty, and staff--past, present, and (hopefully) future.</p>
<p>We value human diversity because of (not despite of) our faith and beliefs, and we want our school to reflect this through both their words and their actions.</p>
<p>We are here to raise funds to offer to the Marian High School administration in exchange for:<br/></p><ul>
<li>a sustainable professional development plan to train all faculty and staff in diversity and inclusivity;</li>
<li>a high-quality diversity club moderated by either a trained staff member or a trained youth advocate where students can feel supported (and offer support) regardless of their sexuality, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or ability.</li>
</ul><p><b>What We Need<br/></b>
Marian High School relies on student tuition and private donations for funding, and the administration undoubtedly knows that money talks. </p>
<p>We seek to raise at least $50,000 to offer to Marian High School, provided that the funding goes toward: professional development in diversity and inclusivity for all staff and faculty as well as a student-focused diversity club that provides a safe space, a welcoming community, and a forum for dialogue.  We will offer any funds that are raised by the end of this campaign, regardless of the amount.</p><p>Based on calculations made through The Wallace Foundation website, our conservative estimate to sustain an out-of-school program alone is about $10,000 per year. A five-year program, based on this conservative estimate, will be above $50,000. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/877844/files/20140923170430-image.png?1411517070"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Our goal is for these institutional changes to create a school culture where all members (students, faculty, staff, and families) can feel supported, valued, and heard regardless of their sexuality, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or ability.</p>
<p>If the Marian administration refuses to open their minds and hearts to join the rest of us in the 21st century, the money will be donated to Affirmations, a local LGBT community center that also offers youth empowerment programming.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b>Why We Are Here</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/876558/files/20140923072425-1.jpg?1411482265"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>In June 2014, Barb Webb, who served at Marian High School for nine years as a chemistry teacher and a volleyball coach, discovered the joyful news that she and her partner, Kristen, were pregnant. Ms. Webb informed the Marian administration of her pregnancy in July 2014, asking for a leave of absence in a proactive attempt to remain discreet and to not cause any undue attention to herself, her partner, and their soon-to-be family. In August 2014, the president of Marian High School gave Ms. Webb two options: resign, or we will terminate you. If she had chosen to resign, Ms. Webb would have received health benefits through the end of May 2015 and would have been required to sign a confidentiality agreement.  Essentially, the Marian administration would have paid for her silence.</p><p>Barb Webb, however, did not choose to be silent. She chose to take the termination and  to speak out against discrimination.  In doing so, a community of thousands of supporters from across the globe--starting with just one passionate alumna who started a Facebook group--chose to stand with her in solidarity.</p><p>We are here to encourage you to stand with us, too, and to stand for equality.</p><p><b>How Marian Can Be the Change </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/876568/files/20140923072948-3.jpg?1411482588"" src="""" style=""width: 368.078px; height: 244px;""/></p>
<p>Our hope is for Marian to be a Catholic school that is truly catholic--that is, a school that is inclusive of all people.  We hope for the students to feel valued and supported, regardless of who they are or who they love, and we want the veils of shame and secrecy of being LGBTQ to be lifted. </p>
<p>With your help, we can provide the Marian High School administration with the funding and resources necessary to promote a culture of inclusion that values human diversity.</p>
<p>For Marian to accept the funding to create positive, institutional change is far from radical. Rather, it simply would be living up to the mission of the school to <b>“enable young women to value human diversity and live responsible lives of leadership and action“</b> and to the mission of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary <b>“to bringing about the dream of God on planet Earth through respect for, nurturing of and promoting liberation and well-being of all persons and all of nature as God’s good creation.”</b></p>
<p>We urge Marian to be the change (and for you to help us), because we are part of and allies to the LGBTQ community, because we love someone who is, because we acknowledge reality, and because it is time.</p>

We are Marian High School--a Catholic, college-preparatory school for young women sponsored by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. 
We are students, families, faculty, and staff--past, present, and (hopefully) future.
We value human diversity because of (not despite of) our faith and beliefs, and we want our school to reflect this through both their words and their actions.
We are here to raise funds to offer to the Marian High School administration in exchange for:
a sustainable professional development plan to train all faculty and staff in diversity and inclusivity;
a high-quality diversity club moderated by either a trained staff member or a trained youth advocate where students can feel supported (and offer support) regardless of their sexuality, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or ability.
What We Need
Marian High School relies on student tuition and private donations for funding, and the administration undoubtedly knows that money talks. 
We seek to raise at least $50,000 to offer to Marian High School, provided that the funding goes toward: professional development in diversity and inclusivity for all staff and faculty as well as a student-focused diversity club that provides a safe space, a welcoming community, and a forum for dialogue.  We will offer any funds that are raised by the end of this campaign, regardless of the amount.Based on calculations made through The Wallace Foundation website, our conservative estimate to sustain an out-of-school program alone is about $10,000 per year. A five-year program, based on this conservative estimate, will be above $50,000. Our goal is for these institutional changes to create a school culture where all members (students, faculty, staff, and families) can feel supported, valued, and heard regardless of their sexuality, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or ability.
If the Marian administration refuses to open their minds and hearts to join the rest of us in the 21st century, the money will be donated to Affirmations, a local LGBT community center that also offers youth empowerment programming.
Why We Are HereIn June 2014, Barb Webb, who served at Marian High School for nine years as a chemistry teacher and a volleyball coach, discovered the joyful news that she and her partner, Kristen, were pregnant. Ms. Webb informed the Marian administration of her pregnancy in July 2014, asking for a leave of absence in a proactive attempt to remain discreet and to not cause any undue attention to herself, her partner, and their soon-to-be family. In August 2014, the president of Marian High School gave Ms. Webb two options: resign, or we will terminate you. If she had chosen to resign, Ms. Webb would have received health benefits through the end of May 2015 and would have been required to sign a confidentiality agreement.  Essentially, the Marian administration would have paid for her silence.Barb Webb, however, did not choose to be silent. She chose to take the termination and  to speak out against discrimination.  In doing so, a community of thousands of supporters from across the globe--starting with just one passionate alumna who started a Facebook group--chose to stand with her in solidarity.We are here to encourage you to stand with us, too, and to stand for equality.How Marian Can Be the Change 
Our hope is for Marian to be a Catholic school that is truly catholic--that is, a school that is inclusive of all people.  We hope for the students to feel valued and supported, regardless of who they are or who they love, and we want the veils of shame and secrecy of being LGBTQ to be lifted. 
With your help, we can provide the Marian High School administration with the funding and resources necessary to promote a culture of inclusion that values human diversity.
For Marian to accept the funding to create positive, institutional change is far from radical. Rather, it simply would be living up to the mission of the school to “enable young women to value human diversity and live responsible lives of leadership and action“ and to the mission of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary “to bringing about the dream of God on planet Earth through respect for, nurturing of and promoting liberation and well-being of all persons and all of nature as God’s good creation.”
We urge Marian to be the change (and for you to help us), because we are part of and allies to the LGBTQ community, because we love someone who is, because we acknowledge reality, and because it is time.
Where We Go Next If...The Marian administration may wish to continue their culture of silence, shame, and secrecy. They, indeed, may refuse to take the money we raise and instead maintain the discriminatory and outdated status quo. If Marian chooses to pass up an incredible opportunity to be the change, all money raised will be given to Affirmations, the largest LGBT community organization in the state of Michigan.  When Your Voice Is What You Can Give If you are unable to make a monetary donation, we appreciate your support in the form of spreading the good word.

<p>Tufaan Entertainment is a student-led non-profit entertainment company at Northwestern University. Our mission is to raise awareness of South Asian culture in the US and promote education through the arts abroad by hosting a national South Asian dance competition every year. Every year we invite 10 of best collegiate dance teams from across the country to compete in Chicago and donate 100% of the proceeds to a beneficiary that supports education and the arts in India. For the past three years, we have supported Shanti Bhavan Children's Project and over this time, we have donated over $40,000 to them.  Shanti Bhavan is a k-12 boarding school in India that provides a world-class liberal arts education, completely free of cost, to some of India's most socioeconomically disadvantaged children. They provide everything from shelter to school supplies and focus on holistic learning so that their students are one day able to enter the workforce as confident and capable individuals, thus alleviating the cycle of poverty that their families have faced for generations before them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Although running Tufaan does cost us nearly $10,000 every year, we recognize that the scale of our donation to Shanti Bhavan would not be possible without running our dance competition. 100% of all ticket sales from the show every year are donated directly to Shanti Bhavan. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Last year, we decided that we wanted to increase our annual donation to Shanti Bhavan so we set up a separate fundraiser with the sole purpose of raising money strictly for them. <b>100% of the money raised through this campaign will be sent directly to Shanti Bhavan! </b>We were able to successfully fundraise $2,000 through this campaign last year and we hope to surpass that amount this year. </p>

Tufaan Entertainment is a student-led non-profit entertainment company at Northwestern University. Our mission is to raise awareness of South Asian culture in the US and promote education through the arts abroad by hosting a national South Asian dance competition every year. Every year we invite 10 of best collegiate dance teams from across the country to compete in Chicago and donate 100% of the proceeds to a beneficiary that supports education and the arts in India. For the past three years, we have supported Shanti Bhavan Children's Project and over this time, we have donated over $40,000 to them.  Shanti Bhavan is a k-12 boarding school in India that provides a world-class liberal arts education, completely free of cost, to some of India's most socioeconomically disadvantaged children. They provide everything from shelter to school supplies and focus on holistic learning so that their students are one day able to enter the workforce as confident and capable individuals, thus alleviating the cycle of poverty that their families have faced for generations before them.

   What We Need & What You Get
Although running Tufaan does cost us nearly $10,000 every year, we recognize that the scale of our donation to Shanti Bhavan would not be possible without running our dance competition. 100% of all ticket sales from the show every year are donated directly to Shanti Bhavan. 

Last year, we decided that we wanted to increase our annual donation to Shanti Bhavan so we set up a separate fundraiser with the sole purpose of raising money strictly for them. 100% of the money raised through this campaign will be sent directly to Shanti Bhavan! We were able to successfully fundraise $2,000 through this campaign last year and we hope to surpass that amount this year.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Kim. I have a Master's Degree in Clinical Psychology and a strong passion for working with children. For over 10 years, I have enjoyed the experience of working with preschool age children in various settings.  I have volunteered in child care centers, for Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and in centers for children with autism. I have worked in facilities for children coaching non-competetive gymnastics, karate, sports, and dance for 7 years. I am very playful, open, and loving and am a magnet for 2-5 year olds. In addition to teaching, I have developed curriculum, and grown numerous programs with my excellent sales and marketing skills. I also gained valuable administration and bookkeeping skills through employment at a CPA firm. I have always wanted to combine my passion for psychology with my passion for children. Finally, I figured out a great plan to do this. I have developed a program that will enhance the social and emotional development of children through play. Specifically, the children will learn skills needed for conflict resolution, stress reduction, anger management, and building empathy. The curriculum will be laid out so each fun activity provides a lesson and time to practice these skills. The parents will know what their little ones are <em>learning</em>, but the children will think they are just <em>playing</em>. These classes will be taught at various private preschools, child care centers, and park districts. The focus will initially be on children from 2-5 years old and will later expand to older children (through colllege) and children with special needs. The plan going forward will be for expansion to several teachers, franchising, and then media involvement. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone can benefit from increased awareness and self control. We have all said or done something that we later regret. Often, our instinctive reactions come from a lack of immediately available alternatives. Young children are likely to have a meltdown, tantrum, or to resort to a physical expression of their anger such as hitting. Unless we teach children how to calm themselves, manage their anger, and teach them different responses, we can't expect them to act differently. Increasing empathy and connectedness amongst peers will decrease bullying and create an environment that feels safer and is more suitable for learning. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are going to be multiple phases of this business. The first phase will begin with training educators and parents to raise awareness of the way they are disciplining children. It is the goal of this business to shift away from fear and punishment based disciplines and move towards methods of discipline that provide explanations of how to do things correctly(rather than telling children what not to do) and building connectedness that cause an increased desire to please others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> In the second phase, I will purchase the equipment needed to run fun classes for children including a parachute, balls, bubbles, musical instruments, hula hoops, bean bags, scarves, music, etc. A company logo and name will need to be created. Marketing materials such as brochures, business cards, banners, and posters will need to be designed and printed. Storage space will be needed for the equipment (more cost effective than an office!!) and insurance will need to be paid for. One of the great things about this model is that after the initial start up costs, there are very few monthly expenses. This makes it much easier for the business to suceed and expand rapidly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The third phase will focus on widening the impact of this program through added classes, instructors, accomodating more ages, franchising and extending the program to more locations, and using media to spread the information as well. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a thank you for helping me, I will provide you with resources/tips to help reduce your stress, manage your anger, and connect better with your parents/peers/family. Of course, you will also have my neverending gratitude and the satisfaction of having a positive impact on the lives of countless children and families!</p>

<p>MuseumNext is Europe's big conference on the digital side of museums. This event brings together leading experts from museums and galleries around the world to share their experience of using digital and social media.<br/><br/> In 2011, we filmed the conference for the first time. These films have been freely available for anyone to watch since that event and they have collectively had over 20,000 views (see an example here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/vvVjjl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bit.ly/vvVjjl</a> ). <br/><br/> These have helped students studying a wide range of related subjects and informed best practice at museums and galleries around the world.<br/><br/> The next conference will take place in Barcelona in May. It will feature over 40 presentations from institutions including TATE, Smithsonian, MoMA, V&amp;A, Victoria and Albert Museum, Van Gogh Museum, Tyne and Wear Museums, Museum Kunstpalast, Science Museum, The National Gallery of Denmark, Stedelijk Museum, Museum aan de Stroom, Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona, Dulwich Picture Gallery, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museon<em>, </em>Fundació Joan Miró, Museum de Toulouse, Reinwardt Academy, The Acropolis Museum, Manchester Museum, Royal Museums Greenwich and Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House.</p>
<p>We would like to capture these presentations, and share them online for anyone interested in how museums can best use social and digital media.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>MuseumNext receives no funding and is essentially a grassroots organisation, run by volunteers who are passionate about sharing best practice in the museum sector. We want to raise $10,000 to hire a film crew to capture high quality films of the presentations in a format which is easily shared online.</p>
<p>These films will join the existing film library on <a href=""http://www.museumnext.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.museumnext.org</a> and will be free for anyone to view.<br/><br/> As well as sharing the films of the presentations with the world, we will also capture interviews, tips from experts and behind the scenes footage which we will make <strong>exclusively available to those who donate more than $20 to fund the filming.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>We know that the films of MuseumNext 2011 have been quoted in dissertations, used to convince managers of the value of social media and shared by those who attended the event with colleagues who weren't there.<br/><br/>We believe that sharing the knowledge from our 2012 conference can add to this resource, inspiring museums and galleries around the world to think about 'what's next'.</p></div>","Help us to share MuseumNext with the world

It will feature over 40 presentations from institutions including TATE, Smithsonian, MoMA, V&A, Victoria and Albert Museum, Van Gogh Museum, Tyne and Wear Museums, Museum Kunstpalast, Science Museum, The National Gallery of Denmark, Stedelijk Museum, Museum aan de Stroom, Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona, Dulwich Picture Gallery, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museon, Fundació Joan Miró, Museum de Toulouse, Reinwardt Academy, The Acropolis Museum, Manchester Museum, Royal Museums Greenwich and Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House.
We would like to capture these presentations, and share them online for anyone interested in how museums can best use social and digital media.
What We Need & What You Get
MuseumNext receives no funding and is essentially a grassroots organisation, run by volunteers who are passionate about sharing best practice in the museum sector. We want to raise $10,000 to hire a film crew to capture high quality films of the presentations in a format which is easily shared online.
These films will join the existing film library on http://www.museumnext.org and will be free for anyone to view. As well as sharing the films of the presentations with the world, we will also capture interviews, tips from experts and behind the scenes footage which we will make exclusively available to those who donate more than $20 to fund the filming.
The Impact
We know that the films of MuseumNext 2011 have been quoted in dissertations, used to convince managers of the value of social media and shared by those who attended the event with colleagues who weren't there.We believe that sharing the knowledge from our 2012 conference can add to this resource, inspiring museums and galleries around the world to think about 'what's next'.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>If the challenges of adolescence wasn't enough, imagine tackling these formative years while navigating poverty, gang violence, and questionable domestic surroundings.  Very often our students choose to drop out of school based on their immediate community's dysfunction and the lack of support and direction from their parents and siblings.  To return to a productive, learning environment is a monumental challenge and when they do, these students take it upon themselves to find their path.  The Story Project offers programs that help them better understand their obstacles and the road ahead by providing tools that decipher their past journey as they chart a new course, one that has a much better chance of pointing them in a much more fruitful and positive direction.<strong><span><br/></span></strong></p>

<p><span>Behind every successful business, businessperson, and individual is a terrific story.

Our demographic typically falls under the categories of: Title 1, At-Risk, Under-Served, Middle &amp; High School ages. If you're wondering why, the answer is simple. More obstacles.  <br/><br/></span><span>Obstacles are a way of life.

But what if these benchmarks were mired in conflict from the surrounding community? Imagine charting a childhood where the local language was something other than what your often illiterate parents spoke at home? Or consider trying to navigate your early years while your support system is unfortunately dysfunctional due to alcohol or drugs, or even worse, in and out of jail and prison? This is when learning becomes a secondary responsibility behind survival. Eager young brains starving for guidance are forced to adopt a story of a day-to-day existence. Ambitious dreams are soon replaced with nightmares. A childhood of wonder is soon replaced by a life of fear. With time these young lives are lived moment-to-moment. There is no more ambition, only blame. These once innocent lives are then often adopted into a destructive lifestyle of gang violence and despair.<br/></span></p>

Thankfully brilliant educators and forward thinkers are now stepping into the school system with new and creative means of revamping an outdated model of education that struggles to meet its goals. With that in mind, it is <strong>The Story Project</strong>'s mission to supplement current academic programs with a unique storytelling curriculum that encourages students to meet their challenges head on creating all sorts of stories through conventional media they already enjoy.

<li>""During a 6 week summer program, The Story Project gave an amazing opportunity to 18 Howard County Middle School students to explore the world of writing through their own creative eye. By the middle of July, these children were hard at work as a team, defining their story's theme and identifying the main problem in their Story Project.  Within their unified effort, they identified the characters, blocked each act, and worked on props and costumes.   It was a thrill to be involved in this empowering experience and to see the excitement in our student's eyes as they shared their productions on Premiere Night with their family and friends.""</li>

<ul>
<li><span>I was extremely excited to be involved with The Story Project's East Coast pilot program.<br/><br/> I thought the entire process itself had a structured curriculum (e.g.,<br/> reviewing the components of developing a good story), as well as a<br/> unique organic element to it that allowed for students to fully<br/> conceptualize the project and get involved from start to finish. I<br/> appreciated how the shyest student and the outgoing extrovert could<br/> find themselves equally involved in The Story Project - and both could<br/> flourish!<br/><br/> Julie and yourself quickly established a strong rapport with the<br/> students; instruction was very hands-on and delivered in a friendly<br/> and welcoming atmosphere.<br/><br/> Including mentors added a further dimension to the process by having<br/> these experts share their experiences from the field.<br/><br/> I look forward to working with you again!<br/></span></li>

<li>Every week, the students and I look forward expectantly to 3:00, Thursday.  That’s when Todd and Bethany bring us fun activities, brilliant mentors, and involve us in memorable experiences like Peace Jam at Loyola Marymount University. I watch as they bring out the story teller in previously reluctant, unmotivated kids. When kids learn to create stories, you can see that they are learning about themselves and growing in confidence. They really do get inspired!</li>
</ul><p>- Clifton Winnard, Teacher librarian, Mark Twain Middle School, Los Angeles, CA.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<li>The Story Project staff and mentors encourage kids' creativity and self confidence.  They motivate the kids to discuss, write and develop their own ideas as well as share them with the group. The Story Project unites the kids in collaborating as a team,pooling their ideas and deciding on a common group theme.  They then work together on an exciting goal, in our case a short film. The result was a memorable and educational experience that allowed the kids to explore many facets of the entertainment arts as well as to grow in self esteem.</li>

The students of Central High School are blessed to have access to tools such as critical thinking, self-awareness, communication skills, and media literacy provided generously by staff and mentors of The Story Project.  Through ongoing workshops we are able to gain a broader understanding of the talents and gifts that we ourselves hold, and we are constantly challenged in pushing the boundaries of our self expression to manifest these gifts in ways that will benefit our larger community.  We are grateful for all of the resources, motivation, and opportunities that you continue to provide us. 
- Vitaly, Educator at Central High School, Mar Vista Gardens 
 

“...We’re having fun thinking up lines and establishing characters to take part in the story! I can't wait to see what the end product is going to be like!  The most important thing is that we learn from this experience and  grow from The Story Project.
- Whitney Williams, Age 13, Burbank Boys and Girls Club

“What can I say about The Story Project? It is the best. ... If anyone is questioning whether the Story Project works, they are wasting theirtime while missing out on a wonderful program.  Hope The Story Project continues to bless kids around the world.”
- Kristine Cabrera, Age 17, Neighborhood Youth Association
 

""During a 6 week summer program, The Story Project gave an amazing opportunity to 18 Howard County Middle School students to explore the world of writing through their own creative eye. By the middle of July, these children were hard at work as a team, defining their story's theme and identifying the main problem in their Story Project.  Within their unified effort, they identified the characters, blocked each act, and worked on props and costumes.   It was a thrill to be involved in this empowering experience and to see the excitement in our student's eyes as they shared their productions on Premiere Night with their family and friends.""
- Julie Egert, Site Project Coordinator
 

I was extremely excited to be involved with The Story Project's East Coast pilot program. I thought the entire process itself had a structured curriculum (e.g., reviewing the components of developing a good story), as well as a unique organic element to it that allowed for students to fully conceptualize the project and get involved from start to finish. I appreciated how the shyest student and the outgoing extrovert could find themselves equally involved in The Story Project - and both could flourish! Julie and yourself quickly established a strong rapport with the students; instruction was very hands-on and delivered in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Including mentors added a further dimension to the process by having these experts share their experiences from the field. I look forward to working with you again!
- Carmen Albuerne, Information Specialist & Instructor, Howard County Library  East Columbia Branch, Columbia, MD 21045
 

Every week, the students and I look forward expectantly to 3:00, Thursday.  That’s when Todd and Bethany bring us fun activities, brilliant mentors, and involve us in memorable experiences like Peace Jam at Loyola Marymount University. I watch as they bring out the story teller in previously reluctant, unmotivated kids. When kids learn to create stories, you can see that they are learning about themselves and growing in confidence. They really do get inspired!
- Clifton Winnard, Teacher librarian, Mark Twain Middle School, Los Angeles, CA.

The Story Project staff and mentors encourage kids' creativity and self confidence.  They motivate the kids to discuss, write and develop their own ideas as well as share them with the group. The Story Project unites the kids in collaborating as a team,pooling their ideas and deciding on a common group theme.  They then work together on an exciting goal, in our case a short film. The result was a memorable and educational experience that allowed the kids to explore many facets of the entertainment arts as well as to grow in self esteem.

<h2><span><strong>Madagascar LIVE part 2 January 7th -January 23rd</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span><strong> Madagascar Live! Wildlife Kids Club International! And many more programs like these are going to help kids around the world.</strong></span></h3>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span> I am very compassionate about sharing nature with kids! For ten years I worked as a licensed veterinary technician and loved my job. However, deep down I wanted to do more. On December 3, 2005, I watched the Tyra Banks show. Ms. Banks opened the show that morning with these words, “This show is about following your dreams!” Since then, I have never looked back.  I have successfully run my company<em>, Erik's Reptile Edventures</em>, for the past six and a half years. I am truly grateful for this opportunity and universal gift to reach thousands of children. </span></p>
<p><span> Last year I developed a distance learning program called Madagascar Live. In November, 2011, we went to Madagascar. This trip turned out to be a life changing experience.</span></p>
<p><span> <strong><em>The program was the first of its kind in the village of Ranomafana to utilize Skype as the medium to communicate class lessons to children in the United States. I was grateful to all who participated and for the overwhelmingly positive response from the children and teachers!</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>  As a result, the not for profit organization called Wildlife Kids Club International was born! The mission is environmental education for children in impoverished villages throughout the world! We plan to begin this mission by starting our first Environmental Education Center in the village of Ranomafana, Madagascar. </span></p>
<p><span> We are hoping to raise $50,000 to fund the Environmental Education Center. This will have an immeasurable impact on the lives of the children in Madagascar and worldwide! The goal is to have these centers in several countries by the year 2020.</span></p>
<p><span> <strong><em>This campaign is truly an effort to help bring positive changes to the world. I sincerely believe that every child should have the opportunity to know that we are all part of nature. It is so important for us to have an understanding of the connectedness between us and all of the inhabitants of our planet.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I know times are tough, but I hope that you can participate in the Madagascar Live campaign. I will be traveling to Madagascar in January  2013. Based on the success of Madagascar Live in November 2011, I look forward to a very successful January 2013 and hope you will all be able to support us in any way you can.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>See you in Madagascar!</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome everybody! My name is Alina.  I am 20 years old and I from Germany. But, at the moment, I live on the island of Negros Oriental in the Philippines. After I finished high school, I came to the Philippines to work as a volunteer in a community-based organization for 1 year.  Here I am able to experience a new culture away from home while I learn from and help people.  Along with my local team members, we work to enrich the lives of children with opprtunities and skills they do not receive at home or in school.</p>
<p><strong><br/> Our Work</strong></p>
<p>Our little organization is called Bright Lights Community Learning Centers Inc. (BLCLI) and we offer free extra-curricular education for children of all ages in the small farming and fishing villages of Bonbonon and Si-it.  About 70 children visit our two learning centers every Saturday from 8 am till 4 pm. Our curriculum focuses on several skill areas including arts and self-expression, basic computer skills, English reading and writing, and livelihood skills such as cooking healthy food.  We keep the lessons fresh and fun with a variety of topics to edu-tain the children.  We practice skits, make bracelets, learn to vegetable garden, practice self-defense and first aid.  Our children come from families who work hard to provide for their basic needs and Bright Lights aims to offer the children materials and learning opportunities they would not otherwise have access to in their subsistence villages.  You can learn more about the BLCLI on our website- <a href=""http://www.blcli.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.blcli.org</a>. </p>

<p><strong>The Summer class - EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS!</strong></p>
<p>During the 2 month summer holiday in April-May, Bright Lights Learning Centers sessions are held 3 days a week.  During these extra sessions we focus on visual arts and require materials, such as pencils, paint, paper, beads, and food for student meals. Our goal is to reach at least 70 children at the two Learning Centers and each dollar counts.  For example, $1 = 6 pencils or two meals for our children. </p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>Our organization has been sustained for nearly 4 years by the generous contributions of individual donors.  In order to continue reaching our children your donation will be used entirely for materials and meals during our summer sessions.  You will be recognized on our website and receive photos and videos showing how your donation enriched our children--the ""Bright Lights"" of our community. </p>

<p><span><strong>Hello Everyone,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>My name is Hugo Morales, when I started college I was 19. I'm the first one in my family to ever go to college. I come from a very poor family, we used to live in Downtown Los Angeles since I was a kid, then my family and I moved to Burbank. And that is where my dream of becoming an Electrical Engineer seemed reachable, everything was going great until one day in the middle of my second semester I got very sick and went to the emergency room and the doctors diagnosed me with vertigo. Vertigo is a kind of feeling that you get that makes you feel as if you or your surroundings are moving when in reality there is no actual movement. You may feel as though you are spinning, whirling, falling, or tilting, and if you have severe vertigo you constantly have nausea and vomit. You have trouble walking or standing, and you may lose your balance and fall. Therefore I could not go to school anymore because of my vertigo, I talked to my doctor and my school, to be approved for a medical leave.</span></p>
<p><span>The school approved it but towards the end of August I got a letter saying I owed financial aid money. I was soon informed that it did not matter if I was too sick to finish school, I had already attended school for more than half of the semester and Financial Aid insisted for their money back. So I had no choice but to get a job, and when everything seemed to be going well, my mother and I got hit by a car. Due to the accident I became responsible for rent and the care of my mom. So its been almost a year and have not gone back to school and I had lost all hope until I saw a website called indiegoo where people donate to help people achieve their dream. So now I beg you for you to help me achieve my dream to go back to school!</span></p>
<p><span>The link below is proof that i got approved by the school to go on medicial leave and not because i was not doing well in school<br/></span></p>

<p> </p>
<p>We need to raise $50,000 in order to offer scholarships to 100 underprivileged children.  The scholarships provided will allow these children the same opportunities as those that have the means to afford such programs.  In addition to your donations, we are seeking grant opportunities and other fundraising efforts to fund our programs.  </p>

<p>500 donations of $100 = $50,000</p>
<p>50 donations of $1,000= $50,000</p>
<p>While our goal is $50,000, we will still move the program forward if we do not reach our goal.  While we are seeking grant opportunities and holding fundraisers, we still need your help because grants are not always funded in a timely manner.  </p>

<p>As our way of saying thank you for your donation, Choo Smith will send a personal thank you and a personally autographed photo for every donation of $100 or more.  For those donors that donate $500 or more Choo Smith will send a personal thank you, autographed photo and we will provide 4 free tickets to a Harlem Globetrotter game when they come to your area.</p>

Charles founded Choo Smith Youth Empowerment, a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization that focuses on his “4L” philosophy (Love It, Learn It, Live It, Lead It).  Choo trains young athletes to work hard, persevere, and improve their basketball skills.  While he has made them successful on the court, he has found that some are not as successful in the classroom.
 
Due to the economic state of the country, school districts have been forced to make tough financial decisions in an effort to balance the budget.  The budget cuts translate into teacher layoffs, causing overcrowding in the classroom.  Larger student-to-teacher ratios are not always conducive to learning for all students.  Based on all of these factors, Choo made the decision to expand our services to include an educational component.

Choo published his first Children’s Book, “That’s Big, I Want To Have My Own Baseball Field” in April 2011. As a humanitarian, Charles “Choo” Smith has and continues to touch the lives of youth throughout Maryland and across the world.   Some of his humanitarian efforts include:
· Conducted basketball clinics in Israel as part of a goodwill delegation of current and former NBA players with Sports Power International.  During the trip he was personally introduced to the President of Israel, Shimon Peres.
· Participated in a back to school book bag give-a-way with partner Diakon/Kathryn’s Kloset
· Read a book to a first grade class at Pimlico Ele/Middle School’s “Book for Breakfast” program during American Education Week.
· Assisted in giving coats to homeless men at the Helping Up Mission in Baltimore, MD at The Annual Coat Give-a-Way event with the Baltimore Ravens/Diakon/Kathryn’s Kloset.
· Read his new children's book ""That's Big"" to a group of children at Easter Seals.   
Choo has received numerous awards and recognitions for his work and service in the community with children and youth.  Some of these awards and recognitions include:
· Received the 2011 Presidential Volunteer Services Award 
· For the first time in the 85 Year history of the Harlem Globetrotters, they partnered with a former player to raise funds to help underprivileged children attend the 2011 Choo Smith Summer Basketball Camp.

<h3>FRIDAY NIGHT JAZZ COMMUNITY FESTIVAL and                       SCHOOL SUPPLY GIVEAWAY</h3>
<h3>Friday and Saturday September 28-29 2012</h3>
<h3>Each One Teach One And Each One Reach One and the Culture Will Survive!!</h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Hello, we are Denise King and Suzanne Burgess, Jazz vocalist and Monica Allison President of Cedar Park Neighbors. We have joined together to bring music and education to the community...WE NEED YOUR HELP!!  QUICKLY!! On Friday September 28 and Saturday September 29th we are hosting a FREE event!! ALL ARE WELCOME!!</p>
<p>With the end of summer rapidly approaching and our children returning to school, it is our desire, but also we feel our duty, to help them excell by supplying them with the necessary tools to begin a succesful school year. Our goal is to bring music back to the community with an educational component. This is necesary because the arts are being eliminated from our public school curriculum and because it exposes the children to the genre of Jazz music. The concerts will also offer a safe place for seniors to enjoy music that many of them grew up with. No barriers or no cover charges...FREE. This event will bring the community together through music and education and hopefully leave a lifelong impression on everyone in attendance</p>
<p>In 1999, Denise King along with Bill Coleman founded a community based Jazz Series. Every Friday from Memorial Day to Labor Day we hosted FREE concerts for my neighborhood in West Philly. Because of the number of children present, Denise  started a literacy program BeBop and Books. Children were given books to keep trade or give back. Musicians were hired and paid through grass roots fundraising efforts and neighborhood sponsors. We even passed the bucket. In 2008 because funding dried up and my personal schedule no longer made it possible to make a weekly commitment, the series dwindled to one concert a month if that. Sadly BeBop and Books stopped. No more free books for kids.</p>
<p>It was an awesome event that impacted many in the community. It boasted a culturally and ethnically diverse audience all who loved Jazz. We all enjoyed the music, the sense of community and friendship. For two hours every Friday we came together as one big happy family.</p>
<p>We need to raise $8,000 to buy books, backpacks, other school supplies and also need to compensate musicians to perform and sound crew. Any dollar amount is wonderful and will help tremendously. </p>
<p>For any contribution your name will be listed on our program.</p>
<p>For your $10 donation you will receive a custom T-Shirt designed by a local artist</p>
<p>While $8,000 is our goal, If we don't reach that number, every dollar will be used to purchase as many backpacks and school supplies as we can and as well hire as many musicians as we can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Many children start school at a disadvantage. With the economy being so bad many people simply can't afford the bare necessities. Every child should be able to start school with the tools that they need to learn and to be good students. This campaign will address that need for, we hope, at least 100 children. It will take the pressure off of some parents who struggle to make ends meet and who simply don't have the means can't afford to buy their children everything that they need. The music component will be an educational experience for these kids. Many children, because music programs have been discontinued in schools, have never seen a real instrument or seen real musicians play. My hope is that it will impact or inspire some to pick up and instrument and explore the world of music. We chose this weekend because it is the culmination of my Denise King's European tour...I will be coming home. This was laid on our hearts to do. We need your help!!</div>

<p>Dear redditors,</p>
<p>I am a 19 year old who is humbly asking for help from fellow internet lurkers. I have been accepted to a higher-end University and unfortunately can not afford tuition and residence fees on my own. I realize that this post may sound like someone begging for money, but I assure you, this is not something I would be writing had I any other option. My parents immigrated to Canada so I could live the life they could only dream of living back home. With that being said, they worked 2 minimum wage jobs each just so our family could survive when I was younger. With whatever income they had, they were just breaking even. All that to illustrate that unlike the other kids whose parents created RESP accounts for them, I did not have that privilege. Midway through high school, I had truly realized the sacrifice my parents made for me and decided enough was enough and the slacking off had to be put to an end. That was when I started putting effort into school work. All in all, I graduated high school with an GPA of 82% in my top six classes. I was the first person in my extended family to ever graduate high school, let alone receive acceptance to a University. Also, I was accepted to my first choice university and now risk having that offer withdrawn because I cannot afford to pay for tuition. For all those who will tell me to get a job, I am working part time and use this money to aid my parents in paying off bills, etc. So all I ask is that you donate anything you can. That would greatly make me grateful and once again have faith in humanity.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>-M</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT US</strong></p>
<p>We get girls off the street and into school in one of the poorest slums in the world in Liberia, West Africa. We work with community leaders to identify the girls who are at the highest risk of being sexually exploited to ensure that education and opportunity, not exploitation and poverty, defines their lives. We pay tuition, provide school lunch and we work with the school and community to make it impossible for her to fail. It's working, 10% of our girls are 1st in their class!</p>

<li>When a girl in the developing world receives seven or more years of education, she marries four years later and has 2.2 fewer children.</li>

<p><strong>Thank you for viewing our campaign. We are Terrell and Claudio Martinez, the founders of the Now’s the Time Project. We are parents and grandparents and have a profound love for all children. <strong><strong><strong>Their innocence, beauty, wide-eyed sense of wonder, honesty, unconditional love and unlimited imagination are our inspiration. <strong>This project was born of our vision and heartfelt desire of being active co-creators of a better world for our children and to help children in need. </strong></strong></strong></strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>We have over 40 years professional experience as a teacher and practitioner in the healing arts and 30 years as a professional in the entertainment industry respectively. This is a mission of love that enables us to utilize our individual and collective gifts as a unified force of love to ""be the change."" Like Leela and Kathleen (two of our singers) say in our promo video,""We're all in this together."" Together we can impart a powerful multi-media message in support of children everywhere and bring joy (through live music, sharing, storytelling and wonderful giftbags) to children in need.</strong></p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p><strong>- is to bring love, joy, inspiration and hope to children in need and to creatively empower children everywhere. By combining the universal languages and healing frequencies of music (sound) and art (color) with storytelling we are delivering a powerful and positive message. <br/></strong></p>

<strong> </strong>Our Message</h2>
<p><strong>- Now’s the Time to honor our divinity, both individually and collectively, embrace the power of love and release all fear. We are all infinitely more beautiful and powerful than we have heretofore been led to believe. It’s time for humanity to rise and shine, transcend our differences, claim our power and unify as conscious co-creators and make this world a better place for our children.<br/></strong></p>

Its creation and evolution was an incredible divinely led journey.

<h2>Children in Need - Live Music and Gifting Campaign</h2>
<p><strong>At the heart of this campaign are the gift bags and live music performances we are planning for the children in the different wards of Millers Children’s Hospital in Long Beach, California.  Kathleen and some other top performers are ready for action. The hospital is waiting for our call to let them know when we are coming. Other hospitals are waiting in the wings. We just need our team together and van packed with the necessary supplies. We plan to be there within two months of funding. We are grateful to our great group of sponsors who are making their products, resources and services available for some of your perks and the children’s gift bags. It’s all lined up.</strong></p>
<h2>What We Need:</h2>
<p><strong>Funds for the materials and services necessary to produce the six item gift bags for hospital campaign (t-shirts, posters, stickers, wristbands, live-action underwater dolphin DVD and our CD). The services required include: digital imaging, silkscreening, graphics/logos, printing, replicating, duplicating, graphic design, plus materials for 500* gift bags.*(We need to have extra on hand for the patients siblings).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Funds for a batch of promotional items (same as above) to help spread the word, the message and engender global support - we have already received great feedback from elementary school teachers who have played ""Now's the Time for their students and we'd love to give out batches of free download cards and whenever possible, free cd's. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>A really cool initial music video that's worthy of the song for promotion (You Tube, etc).  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>An incredible website where people experience our vision and story, meet our (ever expanding) team, join in, network and empower the movement. The website will be an amazing experience with virtual portals and fluid moving imagery with our dolphin and whale allies and an original cast of colorful characters who will help us engage, inspire and eduate the children. It will also provide entrees to the other aspects we are developing - videos, apps, games, films and illustrated storybooks with very special attributes.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Social Media - we want to reach MILLIONS of people as quickly as possible and this requires the resources to hire the right people (that we have) and facilitate this. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Travel, lodging and basic expenses (for two weeks) for Kathleen - lead singer and youth ambassador who lives in Massachusetts and basic expenses (food and gas) for the local team (artists/performers) for this first children’s hospital campaign. They're volunteers coming from different areas, however, we would like to pay for their gas to staging points and buy them lunch each day. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cargo Van Rental – 2 weeks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 man video crew – 2 weeks (filming). <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hire our team – Artists, Illustrators, Graphic Artist, 3D Visual Artist, Web, IT, Social Marketing Expert <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>We also wish to present Millers Children's Hospital with the gift of a full sized framed Giclee of Giorgio Tuscani's original oil painting ""Unconditional Love - Now's the Time.""<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>We have the personnel to do all this – we simply need your help so we can put them to work.</strong></strong></p>

<h2><strong>The Money We Raise..</strong></h2>
<p><strong><strong><strong>..will be used in the most efficient way to fulfill our goals in as many complete steps as is made possible. Exceeding our goal will afford us many options in going beyond the goals of this first phase. We can start another hospital gifting and performance campaign, embark on the filming of our live action short film/music video for ""Now's the Time"" and produce more music and art that supports the mesage. There is a great deal that we can do and we have an abundance of talented individuals we can put to work.</strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<h2>What You Get:</h2>
<p><strong>The knowledge that your heartfelt energy helped bring love, joy, inspiration hope and some great gift bags to hundreds of children in need. That’s priceless. You’ll also get some wonderful perks made possible by Giorgio Tuscani’s art and other amazing sponsors in fields ranging from the arts to health and wellness who are in alignment with our mission.</strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","The Now's the Time Project
Thank you for viewing our campaign. We are Terrell and Claudio Martinez, the founders of the Now’s the Time Project. We are parents and grandparents and have a profound love for all children. Their innocence, beauty, wide-eyed sense of wonder, honesty, unconditional love and unlimited imagination are our inspiration. This project was born of our vision and heartfelt desire of being active co-creators of a better world for our children and to help children in need. 
We have over 40 years professional experience as a teacher and practitioner in the healing arts and 30 years as a professional in the entertainment industry respectively. This is a mission of love that enables us to utilize our individual and collective gifts as a unified force of love to ""be the change."" Like Leela and Kathleen (two of our singers) say in our promo video,""We're all in this together."" Together we can impart a powerful multi-media message in support of children everywhere and bring joy (through live music, sharing, storytelling and wonderful giftbags) to children in need.
Our Mission
- is to bring love, joy, inspiration and hope to children in need and to creatively empower children everywhere. By combining the universal languages and healing frequencies of music (sound) and art (color) with storytelling we are delivering a powerful and positive message. 
                                        
               * the voices of the humpback whales help empower the children.

 Our Message
- Now’s the Time to honor our divinity, both individually and collectively, embrace the power of love and release all fear. We are all infinitely more beautiful and powerful than we have heretofore been led to believe. It’s time for humanity to rise and shine, transcend our differences, claim our power and unify as conscious co-creators and make this world a better place for our children.
                         
                    *the dolphin voices help inspire and bring joy to the children.
 We wrote and produced, “Now’s the Time,” a powerful, uplifting and healing original song in honor of all children: with three prodigal young musical artists supported by four world-class studio musicians, the voices of whales and dolphins and a slice of magic by a Grammy-award winning artist/composer/ arranger. Its creation and evolution was an incredible divinely led journey. World renowned “Art of My Soul” angel artist, Giorgio Tuscani, has painted three phenomenal original paintings in support of our project. His artwork will grace our CD, some of the promotional items, some of the items for your perks and items for the gift bags for our  …
Children in Need - Live Music and Gifting Campaign
At the heart of this campaign are the gift bags and live music performances we are planning for the children in the different wards of Millers Children’s Hospital in Long Beach, California.  Kathleen and some other top performers are ready for action. The hospital is waiting for our call to let them know when we are coming. Other hospitals are waiting in the wings. We just need our team together and van packed with the necessary supplies. We plan to be there within two months of funding. We are grateful to our great group of sponsors who are making their products, resources and services available for some of your perks and the children’s gift bags. It’s all lined up.
What We Need:
Funds for the materials and services necessary to produce the six item gift bags for hospital campaign (t-shirts, posters, stickers, wristbands, live-action underwater dolphin DVD and our CD). The services required include: digital imaging, silkscreening, graphics/logos, printing, replicating, duplicating, graphic design, plus materials for 500* gift bags.*(We need to have extra on hand for the patients siblings).
Funds for a batch of promotional items (same as above) to help spread the word, the message and engender global support - we have already received great feedback from elementary school teachers who have played ""Now's the Time for their students and we'd love to give out batches of free download cards and whenever possible, free cd's. 
A really cool initial music video that's worthy of the song for promotion (You Tube, etc).  
An incredible website where people experience our vision and story, meet our (ever expanding) team, join in, network and empower the movement. The website will be an amazing experience with virtual portals and fluid moving imagery with our dolphin and whale allies and an original cast of colorful characters who will help us engage, inspire and eduate the children. It will also provide entrees to the other aspects we are developing - videos, apps, games, films and illustrated storybooks with very special attributes.
Social Media - we want to reach MILLIONS of people as quickly as possible and this requires the resources to hire the right people (that we have) and facilitate this. 
Travel, lodging and basic expenses (for two weeks) for Kathleen - lead singer and youth ambassador who lives in Massachusetts and basic expenses (food and gas) for the local team (artists/performers) for this first children’s hospital campaign. They're volunteers coming from different areas, however, we would like to pay for their gas to staging points and buy them lunch each day. 
Cargo Van Rental – 2 weeks.
2 man video crew – 2 weeks (filming). 
Hire our team – Artists, Illustrators, Graphic Artist, 3D Visual Artist, Web, IT, Social Marketing Expert 
We also wish to present Millers Children's Hospital with the gift of a full sized framed Giclee of Giorgio Tuscani's original oil painting ""Unconditional Love - Now's the Time.""
We have the personnel to do all this – we simply need your help so we can put them to work.
 
Where the Money Goes:
 

The Money We Raise..
..will be used in the most efficient way to fulfill our goals in as many complete steps as is made possible. Exceeding our goal will afford us many options in going beyond the goals of this first phase. We can start another hospital gifting and performance campaign, embark on the filming of our live action short film/music video for ""Now's the Time"" and produce more music and art that supports the mesage. There is a great deal that we can do and we have an abundance of talented individuals we can put to work.
What You Get:
The knowledge that your heartfelt energy helped bring love, joy, inspiration hope and some great gift bags to hundreds of children in need. That’s priceless. You’ll also get some wonderful perks made possible by Giorgio Tuscani’s art and other amazing sponsors in fields ranging from the arts to health and wellness who are in alignment with our mission.

Why we’re doing this?
Kathleen Regan (above left) and Zukari Collins and Leela Ladnier (above right), the three brilliant young voices on the song are perfect representations of the brilliant future that awaits an awakened humanity. They are loving, kind, compassionate, wise, peaceful and happy. Our children are more than the future generations, they are the future and the future starts now. It’s all about love...in action. 
As Leela said in the promo video. ""The age of ME is over. The age of WE has just begun."" 
 
                                                      
  
A little more About Us
 

We are from the Kona Coast on the Big Island of Hawai'i. In addition to the children we get a great deal of joy and inspiration from the dolphins and whales who inhabit the waters and in which we swim. Their voices, beauty, grace and energy have had a profound effect on our lives. 
We have a vast network of (and strategic alliances with) high level professionals in many fields, from the arts and entertainment industry and education to health and wellness and even Quantum Physics who are in alignment with our vision and mission and plan to work with us. All of them have, quite literally appeared on our path - that's how we know we are working with angels..
Some of them are...

<p>Thanks for taking your time to view the video about our organization. I am a 13-year veteran of the United States Army with multiple tours to Iraq and Afghanistan. I have seen too many veterans lose access to their educational benefits they were promised when enlisting in our armed forces. These men and women have deployed to locations across the globe while giving personal sacrifice by leaving behind their families and giving up much of their adult life. </p>
<p>Sequestration and extreme budget cuts are placing harsh restraints on the educational benefits these men and women enlisted to receive. It's our duty to ensure these heroes are properly educated.</p>
<p>Regardless if a veteran completes two or 20 years of service, they depart the armed forces with a plethora of skills and knowledge that is instrumental to the civilian sector. Their knowledge and experience combined with a college education could significantly improve our economy when our veterans enter the civilian workforce. </p>
<p>Our mission is provide educational grants to service members and veterans of the United States Military in order to improve quality of life for veterans and their families. </p>
<p>Our goals are to:</p>
<p>- keep administrative costs to a minimum and master bootstrapping</p>
<p>- receive 501(c)3 status</p>
<p>- provide grants to service members and veterans</p>
<p>- improve quality of life and the U.S. economy</p>
<p>All donors will be providing funds for educational grants in trade, undergraduate, graduate, doctorate, and professional studies. Our request for $13,392.75 is for our foundation to provide educational grants and cover the minute administrative and legal fees required for start-up.</p>
<p>Donors who offer $1,000 or more will receive the name of their family or organization to our organizational website (once launched) and donors who offer $5,000 or more will receive the name of their family or organization to our organizational website (once launched) and a plaque at our future office. </p>

<p>I have an opportunity to go to Washington DC with some of the 8th grade class for 4 days and 3 nights.</p>
<p>My mom and dad are having me earn the money for my trip by spending the summer working.  Some of the jobs I am doing are babysitting, dog walking, dog sitting, lemonade stand and possibly a garage sale.  I really need help toward paying for my trip.  I am willing to work but I won't make enough to pay for the trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Below is the link to USA Student Travel where you can get more of an idea of all the great things I will be doing on the trip.  It's such a great opportunity for me I hope you can help out.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Mosaic Arts Center (MAC) is where West Valley, Maricopa County, AZ kids and parents use art projects to learn Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.  There is no place like this in the West Valley.  We are making a difference; we see “light bulbs” turn on with every class.   </p>
<p>We are open and local kids and parents connect us with the community in ways that make it possible to “kid-test” what we do. We are finding out which art projects best teach Science, Technology, Engineering and Math in ways that meet Arizona Science Education Standards.</p>
<p>We are unique. Our President, Marty Wesolowski, was one of the original designers and developers for the AZ Science Center in Phoenix.  Stocked with Marty-made, hands-on museum grade teaching exhibits, people to teach how each works, “maker-space” where kids and adults can create their own and a stage where they can show-off what they learned. There is nothing like The MAC.</p>
<p>Donors like The City of Avondale, Goodmans Interior Structures, Troon Golf, others and our own sweat equity transformed an abandoned building into a comfortable art-project based Science, Technology, Engineering and Math learning center. It currently costs about $2,000/month to keep the doors open and later this summer we will be paying an additional $1700 for rent. Grants have been applied for and we have an after-school program contract but revenue has not kept up with costs and we are operating out of our pockets.</p>
<p>MAC needs the generosity of people like you.  $20,000 will buy time to secure enough revenue to keep the doors open: And the gratuities you will receive in return for your generosity will make you smile.</p></div>","HELP THE KIDS!
