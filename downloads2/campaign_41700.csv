<p>My name is Rémy Moriconi, i was born in France in Nice in 1999 and i am the son of an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Coming from a family of watchmakers working in a large Swiss watch manufacter, i have been passionate about watches and watchmaking since my childhood.</p>
<p>Being in search of a unique sports watch with very high quality characteristics, i conclued a real observation... A watch combining all its advantages at a very often expensive selling price (even on entry level), which is a real budget that some people can afford.</p>
<p>When i graduated from my graduate watchmaking schools, i had the idea of a great project taking this observation into account... Create a watch brand that addresses this real problem !</p>
<p>""Offer high quality watches at the right price !""</p>
<p>This is why the creation of the 100% French brand Moriconi has seen the light of day.</p>
<p> </p>

Coming from a family of watchmakers working in a large Swiss watch manufacter, i have been passionate about watches and watchmaking since my childhood.
Being in search of a unique sports watch with very high quality characteristics, i conclued a real observation... A watch combining all its advantages at a very often expensive selling price (even on entry level), which is a real budget that some people can afford.
When i graduated from my graduate watchmaking schools, i had the idea of a great project taking this observation into account... Create a watch brand that addresses this real problem !
""Offer high quality watches at the right price !""
This is why the creation of the 100% French brand Moriconi has seen the light of day.
 

 

The french watchmaking house Moriconi is a human and family business created in July 2019 and which promises to offer you the best watch and to make your wrist attractive at the best quality/price ratio !
It is with only 5.000€ and a lot of work, determination and time sacrified that the Moriconi project is launched.
 

 
Through this project that we really care about, we want :
 

 
The Moriconi specifications allow us to offer you high quality watches in limited quantities and in numbered editions, the settings and quality controls of which are carried out in France.
The problem we were faced with was finding a watch for you with a luxury feel for a really affordable price and we made it ! 
Only for you ! 
 

 

 
The funds raised through the Indiegogo campain will be used to :
 

 
You will have understood... Without you support, our beautiful project is not imaginable ! So let's team up together !
 
 

 
 
Inspired by elegance and sportiness, the MR-01 is the first collection of Moriconi men's watches.
Numbered at only 200 pieces, it comes in 2 different colors : BLACK or BLACK AND PINK
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Each Moriconi watch is designed in France, our sources of inspirations are sporting and elegant trends.
Following our exacting specifications and after many drawing and samples later, we created the MR-01, the first Moriconi watch collection for men.
 

 
All Moriconi watches are unique in their design and are represented to accompany you in all your adventures.
 
 

 
 



 
 

 
 

 
To meet the requirements of our specifications and at the same time you respond in terms of confort, aesthetics, durability and quality, we have chosen as the main material of the case 316L stainless steel.
 
Why 316L stainless steel ?

The size of the MR-01 case is ""45mm in diameter"" and ""11mm in thickness"", size simply perfect for a man's wrist !

The black colors of the case is achieved through PVD treatment (physical vapor desposition) with a polished/brushed finish.

bracelet contribute include (249€) ?  TECHNICAL SHEET OF THE RUBBER STRAP MR-01 BLACK : We decided to make the genuine rubber strap for this unique piece, because this strap is really versatile !It goes in the water and dries very quickly, does not cause any alteration, ages very well, goes with any type of clothing and of course they are very confortable.These are really all its advantages for you daily life that have led us to manufacture this type of strap for the comfort of your wrist !  The sapphire glass will be assembled on each of the Moriconi watches because it has many advantages for the use of a watch on a daily basics !It is very resistant to scratches and extreme durability, which gives it a low rate of scratches a breaks.  In terms of classification of mineral hardness, the sapphire glass is in second position, only the diamond comes in front of it... !Sapphire glass is much more expensive to produce than other types of watch glasses, but at Moriconi quality for our

During this time we have developed a deep understanding of the properties of hemp, and now we are delighted to introduce to you our brand new range of hemp watches.  You can specify your own watch dial, highlight colour and strap colour to make your watch truly individual.   Choose 'UNIQUE BIRD' reward in order to add a custom engraving of up to 15 characters to the back-plate.   The world is moving towards a more positive relationship with hemp. This is largely due to the popularity of CBD oil in the health industry and the increasing decriminalisation of cannabis across North America. We have been contributing to this perception change for the last 7 years with our Hemp Eyewear, and now we introduce our new line of watches, Hemp MVMNT.With our Hemp MVMNT watches we aim to showcase yet another possibility of the super crop that is hemp, and to promote the use of alternative eco-materials in general.The coming decades will require us all to think and live more sustainably. Be a part of the movement and join us on this journey.   Renewable technology is at the core of what we do. Our leading-edge hemp fibre material uses organic plant fibres to create a solid non-plastic material. By combining our material with 100% vegan pineapple leather straps our watches help keep the planet green. We value creativity, innovation and self expression. We strive to maintain our ingenuity by pioneering new technologies and focusing on innovation at our core. Why be the same as everyone else when you can stand out from the crowd? We’ve partnered with the incredible organisation, 1% For The Planet, in order to give 1% of every watch sale to approved environmental nonprofits. Our whole business is based on hemp, so it is only right that we do our part to preserve the natural environment that provides us with this resource. Hemp MVMNT is elegant. It’s a statement for change, for a future where unexpected materials are found in unexpected places. The hemp’s beauty comes from it’s randomness. Magnified by the contrast between the bright, clean stainless steel components, the result is a classy timepiece with a natural twist.The inherent structure of the randomly aligned hemp fibres means every Hemp MVMNT watch is identical while also being as unique as the person who wears it. ‘Original’ is clean and simple. This pared back design takes away the frills and presents a clean, modern, stylish watch. The minute markers are not visible, because life isn’t about counting the minutes. Coming in at 8mm thick - or should we say thin? - with a chamfered bottom edge, ‘original’ is slim, sustainable and unassuming. Available with a charcoal or not-quite-white dial, with either gold-plated or stainless steel highlight colours. There is plenty of room for you to find the watch that feels the most you. The ‘Four Twenty Special’ features a subtle, embossed 420 on the face, letting you know when it’s time to work and when it’s time to play. This watch is a call for conversation and a call to let loose. A symbolic reminder of the work and play balance that is so often swept aside in a hectic lifestyle. ‘Four Twenty’ represents changing times, presenting canna-culture in a stylish, subtle way. The watch is available in silver or gold highlight colours, both featuring the greenest of seconds hands and a reminder for that oh-so-important time of the day.  The outer casing of the watch is the star of the show. Made using our hemp material, the unique patterns mean no two watches are the same. Well they are, but only where it matters. Each case is manufactured on a high-precision CNC, to be sure that the beautiful randomness is only present in the fibres.  We’ve partnered with ANANAS ANAM, producers of Piñatex®, to create a range of beautiful pineapple leather watch straps.This is a 100% vegan and organic alternative to traditional animal leather, which can be unethically sourced and environmentally damaging. Instead these watch straps are made from the fibre of pineapple leaves that pile up as a direct result of agricultural waste.Choose from a selection of 6 coloured straps to personalise your Hemp MVMNT watch to you.Depending on the reward tier you select you will be receiving 1 or 2 straps. You will also be able to add-on additional straps after the campaign ends, when you are making your colour selections.  We believe in the philosophy of 'repair not replace'. Old, battery-powered watch sitting at the back of a draw no longer working familiar to anyone? Along with instructions provided in the packaging, our easily removable back-plate will allow you to quickly and easily change the battery at home.As with all watches you can of course take it to a watch repair shop to carry out the battery change instead. We're trying to empower you, not scare you!  All straps come with a quick release feature, so if you want to purchase additional straps they can be changed in seconds, keeping your watch dynamic and exciting. We are offering three styles with the same unisex watch body. All watches are 37mm in diameter, with a 16mm wide strap. Smallest wrist size is 14cm and largest wrist size is 20cm. After thorough testing, we found these dimensions to be the ideal unisex size, suiting most wearers.  Organic hemp fibre before processing.Early stages of prototyping, designing the watch and developing the process on the CNC machine.Hand finishing the prototypes with a rotary tool.We went through hundreds of iterations before deciding on our three dial designs.Engraving the back-plate of the watch.Testing different pineapple leather colours to make our collection of straps.Fitting the hands to the prototypes.Assembling the watches and comparing our final prototype to our early development (top right). We create the hemp watch cases in our Edinburgh workshop using unique technology developed through years of making glasses with hemp. The cases will be mated with the Miyota 5Y30 quartz movements and other internal components by our assembly partners in Hong Kong, who use their expertise in watch assembly to ensure high quality.We complete the assembly back in Edinburgh by fitting the pineapple leather straps, and carry out quality assurance checks before packing the watches. We care about our customers and we care about the planet.As manufacturers and designers, it's our responsibility to control the lifecycle of our products.

<p>For the movement, Aerotec choose the venerable Miyota 9015. At just 3.90mm in height, the movement allowed for the relatively slim case profile and also provides reliable timekeeping. It offers both hacking and hand-winding and operates at 28,800 bph for a smooth, sweeping effect. One thing to note is that it also boasts a 42-hour power reserve and supports the discreet date function located at 6 o'clock on the Sea Hunt's dial.</p>

Aerotec is pleased to announce the new Sea Hunt line of premium watches made for the sports enthusiast and anyone with an eye for high quality tool watch.  






The Sea Hunt Line is designed to withstand depths of 500 meters and to maintain functionality and style in conditions that would be ruinous to lesser models. Featuring an Italian aged leather strap, a 316L stainless-steel case and Super-Luminova hands and indexes, the Sea Hunt is a distinctive design that is both attention-getting and useful for anyone seeking outdoor adventure.    

The Sea Hunt will be offered in 3 dials, you can choose from three different dial colors, blue or burgundy brushed or black Meteorite dial.
Each dial has its own unique advantages. 



Crystal


The Sea Hunt is equipped with a 3.3mm thick double domed sapphire glass. The double domed feature gives the watch a nice vintage look while still showing the dial from many angles. The crystal will have a double layer of Anti Reflective (AR) coating on the inside of the crystal to reduce reflections.  
Ceramic Bezel 


The bezel plays an important role in our design, the bezel itself is made of stainless steel with ceramic insert and filled with C3 lume at the 12 o'clock marking and has a 120 clicks unidirectional mechanism.
Improvement made for production.
There will be a small improvements made from the BEZEL to the production pieces that you will received. production unit will comes with a 0.4mm slimmer than the prototype pieces.

Crown 


We believe in attention to the finest details and the Sea Hunt is the perfect example. Everything from the sapphire glass to the screw-down crown accentuates the beauty and personality of the timepiece.  The brushed case and the uniquely design caseback with a small sapphire crystal window enhances the luxurious style and rugged look.     


The Sea Hunt diver is tested and rated at 50 ATM / 500m of water resistance. 

A Helium Escape Valve is fitted with the purpose of protecting the case from damage during deep sea diving.  

For the movement, Aerotec choose the venerable Miyota 9015. At just 3.90mm in height, the movement allowed for the relatively slim case profile and also provides reliable timekeeping. It offers both hacking and hand-winding and operates at 28,800 bph for a smooth, sweeping effect. One thing to note is that it also boasts a 42-hour power reserve and supports the discreet date function located at 6 o'clock on the Sea Hunt's dial.

The Sea Hunt comes with a Standard Italian aged leather strap.

Sized at 20mm wide and 3.5mm thick, each strap  comes with extra padding, making it sturdy, yet soft with sweat resistant lining to feel smooth against your wrist. Straps are available in vintage brown leather with 2 two options color stitching : beige and dark brown.






Packaging plays an important role for us so that is why we have created a complete box for the Sea Hunt diver.

</div></div>","eSlim is an electric sonic toothbrush that has all the power and performance of your average electric toothbrush with the addition of an ultra-slim and portable design. Upgrade your dental routine with high-end DuPont bristles with the perfect level of comfort. You'll have that crystal clear smile in no time.
 

 
We approached the design process bias-free to create something that truly reflects what people want - a product that has yet to be discovered by the majority; unique but in-demand.

 
Dental care is an essential part of our daily routine that is often overlooked. We invest more than ever in other health gadgets but our teeth are often ignored, despite the fact that damage to teeth is irreversible. To solve this, all you need is a portable sonic toothbrush that you can take anywhere.
 

 
eSlim provides a premium brushing experience for all, allowing you to simply & easily adapt its portability, aesthetics, functionality & performance to match your needs.

 
Matching the look of the toothbrush to your modern lifestyle and elevating your brushing quality with DuPont brush filaments, three brushing modes, a convenient removable travel cap, and fine-crafted body tube —— all seamlessly into one instrument.

Our goal was simple - to design the world's best portable sonic toothbrush to make you feel confident using it in any situation and maintaining good oral hygiene.
 
 

 
We sought to create a certain aesthetic by combining simplicity, style, elegance, and glamour for the most exclusive product without sacrificing essential functionality. To achieve this high standard, three foundations were necessary.

 
(1) Premium Material — eSlim is all about uniqueness and comfort.  The body is made out of 304 food-grade stainless steel / 6063-grade aluminum alloy that is very durable, and scratch-resistant.

 
 
(2) Surface Treatment — eSlim impressed a valued client with its excellent finishing treatments, which includes vacuum ion sputtering (PVD), anodizing, andanti-fingerprint treatments.

 
(3)  High-Quality Brush Filaments — eSlim's high comfort level is guaranteed. Dentists advise using what feels comfortable and encourage you to brush regularly & correctly. We took that to heart by using DuPont® nylon, which issimply the best.

 
Attraction starts with the first impression
eSlim comes in vibrant colors with a rich satin finish. The brush fits into an elegant cap that encases the entire brush seamlessly for an even more streamlined look.


There are three cleaning modes available at the click of a button⎯ Cleaning, Massage, and Whitening

 
Smart Brushing
The timing function helps you cultivate healthy brushing habits. A vibrating reminder every 30 seconds indicates when you have finished cleaning one area of the mouth, prompting you to continue to another area for a more consistent and thorough cleaning experience.
 Excellent Comfort
eSlim aims to provide the softest and most comfortable cleaning experience. DuPont® produces very high-quality brushes with a balance of consistent quality, wear performance and unmatched productivities in tufting and end-rounding by using DuPont filaments.
  
High Vibration, Deep Cleaning
With the highest vibration speed at up to 27,000 vibrations per minute, the newly designed high-speed sonic micro-motor is user-friendly comfortable and efficient.

Very Quiet
eSlim operates at just 60dB, which is considerably quieter compared to the high pitched buzzing of other sonic toothbrushes - allows you to brush with little disturbance to others.

IP X7 Waterproof
The waterproof performance of the product meets the IP X7 Waterproof standard. This standard ensures effective performance even if the USB port is exposed to the environment for a long period of time. Most importantly, the Micro USB Port itself (while unplugged) is IP X7 water-resistant as well, which means even if water enters the port, it will not damage the toothbrush.

 
Ventilated & Deodorizing
The easy-to-open design easily snaps into place and keeps bristles straight for effective cleaning. Ventilated toothbrush covers protect the brush head and keep it dry between uses. The antibacterial coating keeps the cover clean as well.

 

ANTIBACTERIAL PROTECTION
These toothbrush covers will protect any manual toothbrush & help keep the brush head hygienic. Compact and designed for portability and easy packing, they can be used at home or for work, school or travel. EASY, PORTABLE STORAGE
The toothbrush cover easily snaps into place. It features an antibacterial coating to keep your brush cleaner between uses at home or on the go, and the cover is ventilated to allow the brush head to dry between uses.


Attraction starts with the first impression⎯⎯  eSlim comes in a gorgeous color selection, a rich satin finish, and the brush rests in an elegant cap that connects to the body tube seamlessly
Due to the premium quality of the Aluminium Alloy, the production costs are substantial. If you would like the red Aluminium Alloy toothbrush, please add an extra $10USD which is $78HKD onto your reward:-)

<p>Every
time I climb with women I'm reminded of how powerful those women are and of how
life changing climbing can really be, how it can make you feel stronger, more
powerful and in control of your life. This is what I want to bring to women, to
as many women as I can, from all walks of life, through Womenclimb.</p>
<p>I
want to tell you a story about Natasha.  Natasha is deaf and eighteen months ago she was nearly
killed as a result of domestic violence. 
In the aftermath of her terrifying experiences and through the resulting
darkness she wanted to reconnect with activities she loved doing.  As a child she was so free-spirited, but now
the prospect of stepping out of her comfort zone was a frightening thing to do.  Nevertheless she promised herself that this
would be the year she would learn to climb and in June we climbed
together.  At Womenclimb, <span>each woman is treated as an individual, whatever their
level of climbing.  Our ethos centres on
encouragement, inclusiveness and building confidence.  This ethos and the <a href=""http://www.womenclimb.co.uk/being-deaf-becoming-a-climber/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">support from our community</a>
on the website helped Natasha achieve something that she didn’t think she was
capable of.  The feeling she got at the
top of her first outdoor climb…that feeling is priceless.  </span></p>
<p>Natasha is just one of the many women
that we have reached out to support. 
This campaign is about you helping us to make our reach wider, broader
and deeper.  It’s about reaching out to
people who don’t always have opportunities and helping them to make the most of
their amazing selves.  <span>We’re reaching out to you to join us in making this
happen today.  </span></p>
<p><b>Positive
Action = Rewards</b></p>
<p>It’s
always nice to be rewarded when you do something positive and this campaign is
no exception.  We have lots of perks,
from organic, ethically sourced limited edition T-shirts and really groovy
greetings cards to climbing guidebooks, outdoor climbing days and opportunities to advertise on our
website which gets over 20,000 visitors a year.  If you look at
our gallery (tab on the right) you will see some pictures of the perks!</p>
<p><b>How
your contribution will help:</b></p>
<p>We
want to develop our amazing community of women, online and face to face, so
that we can create amazing life-changing experiences that have positive and
tangible effects on women’s lives and futures. Your contribution will help us
create events, develop pilot projects working with disadvantaged women and
improve everything about what we do.  We
can’t do this without you.  Every single
contribution is a lynchpin in this project. 
</p>
<p><b>A
bit about our history?</b></p>
<p>Womenclimb
was started in 2013 by founder Emily Pitts who recognised that there was little
or no information about climbing by and for women.  Since then the website has been built up on
the work of Emily and a group of volunteers in their spare time.  They
have run a series of successful events and meetups enabling women to learn to
climb and progress their climbing.  </p>
<p>Women
say that they want to meet other women to climb.  They say that climbing
with other women has less testosterone and they feel safe to express
themselves.  Men have been some of our strongest supporters and we thank
them for being there and keeping us going when the going has been tough.
 Whoever you are, if you’re reading this now, know that your contribution
will make a difference. </p>
<p>If you’re completely confused and don’t understand why

Exclusive carbon fiber glasses are hardly seen (at least I have not seen).When they first came into being, they were mainly made with bamboos covered by carbon fiber glasses, but it never went public. Bamboo is light and environmental friendly, while carbon fiber has the reputation as future materials and beautiful interwoven patterns, which can make up the disadvantages of bamboo being brittle, for carbon fiber is very tough. (Hint: Elasticity techniques can also be used in carbon fiber glasses to make the legs soft. At present, the trial is on half way.) Manually made bamboo& wooden glasses always have a touch of rusticity, but with carbon fiber blended, the work has completely been given a kind of technology and modern flavor, extending the range of users.     It looks cold (but better than metal), so it needs a warm materials，bamboo is the best choice.In the future ,I will continue to develop carbon fiber with !bamboo furniture and household products ,it will be very interesting!In face,I have more crazy idea in material science,how knows?.....

who  need your helping ? 









Why need your helping？

      Thanks your time!I am Takemoto.

        I once wrote a long story about all of me,  spent a month to prepare plans, showed all of my best idea and works.but nobody wanted to see. Now I would just like to say: a very hard-working and real craftsmen and designers  needs your help to get rid of his predicament: very hard but very poor, labor gave to the payment of interest. I hand made the 1000 pair of glasses in 2014-2015, and now I'm going to sell them  to win a financial freedom in life,and  cheaper price.(about 20-30% 0FF）



      As a craftsman, I want to have a new larger studio.,away from the neighbor's ridicule and sarcasm (I used to be a successful business of glasses, but began to handmade glasses since 2009, has invested a lot of money in this business,I sold my house ,and two optical store, so become poor, and then laughed at and questions have been around me),As far as possible to reduce dust and noise.   
they are my old studio:
it's 3# studio.I build it alone, it at the top of the seventh floor.But it will be removed at any time, because it shouldn't exist there.



and,This is the 1 # and 2 #, they are bicycle garage, very small.color pictures looks too poor,so,let them being black....

<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The DNAME project started over a
year ago thanks to the help of a small bunch of great visionaries and amazing
supporters. We already faced a lot of issues and problems finding the
right suppliers for such a small and customized production, developing the molds,
testing the product, engraving the metals and so on.... but in the end we
succeed! Right now we have all the machinery ready and set-up to work! So no
more delay, and no more problems. We just need your help to start a bigger
production!! </p>
<h3>F.A.Q</h3>
<div>
<p><b>DO YOU ENGRAVE ALL MY DNA SEQUENCE?</b> No, we don't need it. The
human DNA sequence it's about three billion letters and it is 99,9% common for
all the human being. We will only look into specific repeated regions of
""non-coding DNA"" that will identify you and you only.</p>
<p><b>IS IT SAFE TO SEND YOU MY DNA?</b> Yes, it is 100% safe. As
stated before, we will only look into repeated sequences that are used to
identify people! We know that the DNA is the most unique part of ourself and
it's our priority to fully guarantee the privacy of our customers. For that
reason, we will use an highly specialized laboratory with ISO 9001:2008
accreditation (WORLDWIDE QUALITY CONTROL) to ensure you the highest standard in

else and before we proceed you will have to authorize us to get access only to
the information required for the production of the bracelet.</p>
<p><b>IS IT POSSIBLE TO ADD A
CUSTOMIZED INSCRIPTION TO THE DNAME BRACELET?</b>Yes it
is and it's included at no additional cost. In addition, we strongly suggest
you to further personalize your custom DNAME bracelet.</p>
<p><b>DOES ANYBODY CAN GET HIGHLY

<br/>In 1982, Gianni Versace, together with a German craftsman, invented Oroton metal mesh, a textile that was like the armor of medieval warriors and yet could be draped as fluidly as the softest silk.  After 1982, Versace used metal mesh liberally in every one of his haute couture collections, mixing the material with the most luxurious silks, leathers and wools.

Outsiderz Co. was first launched in 2012, where it took off rapidly, &amp; quickly gained a significant client base. However, after many offers where mass production was necessary, with no substantial backing, the line was unable to keep up with demand, resulting in a 2 year hiatus. Even through this ""downtime,"" the ideas &amp; work never stopped. In 2014, an exclusive extension of Outsiderz Co. was created, relatively named Carnival Diamondz Inc.

Growing up in a creative family, I have always been encouraged to follow my dreams, regardless of financial instability. Outsiderz Co. was first launched in 2012, where it took off rapidly, & quickly gained a significant client base. However, after many offers where mass production was necessary, with no substantial backing, the line was unable to keep up with demand, resulting in a 2 year hiatus. Even through this ""downtime,"" the ideas & work never stopped. In 2014, an exclusive extension of Outsiderz Co. was created, relatively named Carnival Diamondz Inc.

</div></div>","How often have you went to a leading brand and you notice you are spending a killing? We understand the elitist concept of luxury, but in a changing world, why hasn't that idea been shattered as yet? We have all gone to a store and absolutely fallen in love with that leather handbag- and it's so expensive because it's leather, right? Wrong- statistically, we pay more than three times over for items bought in popular stores, our money going towards almost every overhead they have, campaigns, and still not affecting the already ridiculous profit margin. Veritas Clothing, has come to shatter those notions, once and for all. 
We just need a little help from passionate people who share our vision. Leading brands tend to retail mass-produced clothes, and sell them for truly one-of-a-kind pricing. Prices that should give you the right to be the only one in the world to own that item. If only. So here at Veritas Clothing we
 provide handmade luxury apparel, and provide them to you. Instead of

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>""OUCH"" ...as quick as you
read this; that's how fast an accident happens. Imagine how it feels to get a
finger cut with stainless steel surgical grade shears or from kitchen
cutlery. This is what happens on a daily basis. Everyday an accident occurs
with shears or a knife. Some are more severe than the other and some
require a visit to the emergency room. This is why Cosmo Finger Guard was
created. Our patented designs cover the vital areas of the hand, the index
and middle finger as well as the knuckles where the accidents usually
happen. We are piece of mind while using shears, knives or
razors. The use applications are endless! Our campaign is to launch new styles
of specialty safety gloves early 2016 that are unique,
fun and can be personalized. Our product is very important. We
know this because we have created value for the next generation
of users with Safety and Fashion in Mind.  Accidents happen and
injuries are no fun. Down time, workers compensation and a possible visit to
the emergency room are all too real. Your contribution will keep us on the
leading edge of becoming the beauty, home and kitchen industries premier
specialty Safety Glove Company.</p>
</div><p><br/></p><p><strong>            </strong><strong>Patented &amp; Patent Pending Cut Resistant Safety Gloves</strong><strong>   </strong></p><p><strong>

wearing them. The Cosmetology glove is a two finger half palm design; first of
its kind on the market. All of our gloves are rated at cut resistant
level 4 of 5 by ANSI, the American National Standards Institute who measures
cut resistance levels of all gloves on the market. </p>
<p>Our gloves are soft, easy to use and can be soaked in any

</div></div>","Introduction
""OUCH"" ...as quick as you
read this; that's how fast an accident happens. Imagine how it feels to get a
finger cut with stainless steel surgical grade shears or from kitchen
cutlery. This is what happens on a daily basis. Everyday an accident occurs
with shears or a knife. Some are more severe than the other and some
require a visit to the emergency room. This is why Cosmo Finger Guard was
created. Our patented designs cover the vital areas of the hand, the index
and middle finger as well as the knuckles where the accidents usually
happen. We are piece of mind while using shears, knives or
razors. The use applications are endless! Our campaign is to launch new styles
of specialty safety gloves early 2016 that are unique,
fun and can be personalized. Our product is very important. We
know this because we have created value for the next generation
of users with Safety and Fashion in Mind.  Accidents happen and
injuries are no fun. Down time, workers compensation and a possible visit to
the emergency room are all too real. Your contribution will keep us on the
leading edge of becoming the beauty, home and kitchen industries premier
specialty Safety Glove Company.
            Patented & Patent Pending Cut Resistant Safety Gloves   
Our cut resistant gloves are made with the latest
materials available today, UHMWPE Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene
a cut resistant synthetic yarn. This is same materials used in police and
military body armor.  Our gloves also
contain Alphasan which is antimicrobial, making our gloves germ resistant.

Our patent designs are based on the needs of the person
wearing them. The Cosmetology glove is a two finger half palm design; first of
its kind on the market. All of our gloves are rated at cut resistant
level 4 of 5 by ANSI, the American National Standards Institute who measures
cut resistance levels of all gloves on the market. 
Our gloves are soft, easy to use and can be soaked in any
sanitizing solution or bleached. We offer them in multiple colors and also
offer custom embroidering to make our gloves more personable, giving them a
fashion sense.

A lady in black crosses to the center of the start line and holds up a simple sign: 30. Thirty seconds to the start. She waits a bit, then flips the sign around and gives one more wave in front of the drivers: 10. Ten seconds, walking off, 9, 8, 7, the drivers anticipating the start. After those ten seconds come the lights: a sequence of five red lights, one after the other, the illumination of which causes the field of cars to stop sounding like cars and start sounding like something resembling Satan's popcorn machine. The crackling and backfiring continues until the red lights cease, and a set of green lights unleashes <b>3500 horsepower</b>--six cars as much power as thirty of their showroom-floor siblings.<br/><br/>As the cars moved off the small patch of pavement onto the dirt and clay that made up most of the rest of the circuit, the two Subaru Imprezas of Sverre Isachsen and Bucky Lasek pulled ahead from their front row starting positions and bore toward the inside part of the first corner, with Lasek converging on the other front row starter, Patrik Sandell. Sandell, trying to hold his Ford Fiesta's position against the charging Volkswagen Polo of Tanner Foust, was bumped by both Foust and Lasek, sending him <b>straight into the water-filled barrier</b> on the inside of the turn. Sandell's car was lodged in the barriers, forcing the officials to stop the race to remove the crippled car. With the Swede irritated and his car disabled, then, the race was restarted with the space between Isachsen and Lasek empty.<br/><br/>As the green lights came on to start the race, Isachsen pulled ahead, with Lasek behind. Once again, Lasek moved inside, once again Lasek found another car--this time Foust--and once again the car found the barrier. This time, however, Foust continued, despite hitting both the obstacle and immediately being collided into by the Ford of rookie Austin Dyne. As the cars continued to complete the first lap of the heat, the barrier sat in the middle of the track, in an even more prone position than Sandell's car earlier. Above the racing surface, in the press box, the status of the race puzzled some of the press corps, accustomed to the stock car and sprint car races that run at the speedway complex the rest of the season. In any other form of racing, the race would have either been slowed or stopped by this point. Series media director Chris Leone reassured the booth that this was not the case: ""This is rallycross. <b>We don't believe in yellow flags.</b>""<br/><br/>Sure enough, the battle for the lead--with Isachsen being hounded by the Ford of 2013 Lites class winner Joni Wiman--had to go through the mangled barrier and the trail of debris surrounding it, with Lasek getting a piece of the action a couple seconds later to ensure that every car in the heat had hit the now-useless lump of plastic. This is rallycross: a form of racing that has existed in one form or another in Europe for decades. At its most basic form, in the ""folkraces"" of Scandinavia, it really is a <b>borderline demolition derby</b> involving past-their-prime road cars. In greater Europe, though, it was developed as made-for-TV entertainment: an all-star motorsports filler product, combining drivers in pavement racing and dirt rallies.<br/><br/>Stateside, rallycross started as such, but in both cause and effect has become potentially something bigger: a bellwether for not just motorsport, but the whole relationship between sport and commercialism and culture. This is rallycross: a genre of motor racing imported to America as part of the premier showcase for youth-oriented action sports that has sustained a hold on the under-30 demographic to such a degree that, five and a half years after first being contested, more manufacturers, sponsors, and racing teams are <b>looking to get involved</b> as the championship itself successfully spreads its wings from the ESPN mothership from which it was spawned.<br/><br/>This budding success story is as much about favorable conditions outside the sport as it is about the people inside the series who have turned it from a niche event in a festival of niche events into the only racing series running a full schedule on broadcast television; a racing series with more manufacturer representation than NASCAR; a racing series with a more functional track for young drivers to ascend to the top; and a racing series that attracts star power the likes of which other series can scarcely match. This is rallycross: a victory of <b>quality over quantity</b>, a series with just over a dozen full-time drivers and a relative skeleton crew in charge, but with any one of those drivers having a shot at winning, and the series becoming increasingly influential with every move made.<br/><br/>The Global Rallycross Championship has evolved; whereas every race except the X Games round in 2012 was supporting either a NASCAR or Indycar race, by 2015 the entire championship schedule is a series of 12 main events, <b>no longer playing second fiddle</b> to any other racers. As the 2015 season approaches, the series stands at the starting line in as great a position as ever to win over the racing public and put their mark on the automotive world once and for all. This is rallycross: fresher than NASCAR, more relevant than Formula One, and poised to take advantage of both series' missteps and vault into the limelight.<br/><p></p>

The Global Rallycross Championship represents a major intersection in American culture: at a point when mainstream automotive journalists fret over the loss of interest in the younger ""Millenial"" generation in cars, the series aims squarely at them by doing everything that mainstream series like NASCAR and Indycar don't: use real, practical cars (well they start off that way) in short heat races on diverse, mixed-surface courses. It's not simply ""go fast and turn left"", but left, right, and a bit of up and down as well. The result: in just five years, the series has a national TV deal, a title sponsorship with Red Bull, the involvement of four manufacturers (and counting!), and the interest of the whole racing world.

  Why Would You Want Them? While there is really no limit to what you can do with Invisibo's, we've outlined a few reasons why you might want them: 


Give them as gifts and raise your gift giving cred to an all time high


For your significant other - make it a gift that you can BOTH enjoy


For yourself - sometimes you just need some ME time :)

<p><strong>About Vodka T-Shirts </strong></p>
<p>We developed a passion for making Premium quality T-Shirts.
On our trips all over the country, we were always frustrated by the lack of
offerings. Big-brand retailers sold formless T-Shirts and luxury brands charged
exorbitant prices. It seemed like there was a real need for a brand that
focused on great fit and superb quality, all at a reasonable price. That’s where
“Vodka T-Shirt” was born. Our T-Shirts are made with 100% Premium cotton and Bio-washed,
using state of the art technology &amp; machinery in the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, we are headquartered in a small but creative office in
the close proximity to knitwear city and loving every minute of making our
Vodka T-Shirts. We source our fabric from Tiruppur and processing done from
there only. Tiruppur is also known as the ""knitwear capital"" of
India, accounting for 90% of India's cotton knitwear export. All the top
International brands are manufactured here.</p>
<p>We hope you adore our work. Our goal is to build a brand grounded
in our core values of great fit and superb quality. We truly appreciate you
getting involved.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Corporate social
responsibility</b></p>
<p>It has
always been an honest endeavour for Angal to give back to society. We firmly
believe in inclusive growth through social entrepreneurship. In other words, it
is important for an enterprise to empower the weaker sections of society. We
also believe in giving back to nature because nature is the main source of our
functioning.</p>

<div>Design is my passion.  Since I was 5 years old, I have only ever been sure of one thing -- that I was going to be an artist.  After graduating from design school and working for design firms in San Francisco and New York City; I began searching for a way that I could express my own design voice, instead of those of my bosses.  I found my voice in product design and launched my brand in 2013 with my Amethyst NYC SkyKat handmade pillow line, the first of three lines to be featured in editorials on Houzz.com.</div>
<div>     Despite these achievements, my self-funded brand struggles to get the exposure that it needs to thrive.  I believe that a booth at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York City can change that -- allowing me to reach designers and retailers from every corner of the globe.  More exposure = more orders. Higher volume orders would allow me to continue to introduce new products, order materials in bulk (effectively reducing the price of my products), and to pursue my dreams full time.</div>

VOLI: prints on
silk is a new label of wearable

 I am an artist and designer
currently living in Split, Croatia but originally from Australia. I have been
exhibiting and creating photography, collage and printmaking for the past
fifteen years in Australia, the UK and Europe. Since relocating to Croatia I

A sustainable brand supporting family ownedmanufactures.
SHORT SUMMARY I am Tuscan born and raised, and when my job brought me to NYC I realized US is missing out on something big: excellent leathercrafts at a fair price. Americans only have access to Made-In-Italy artisanal products when they are sold - and overpriced - by the big names of fashion. But the same artisans that work for the luxury industry also craft their own private label, which, having no export channel, only remains accessible in some local stores in Italy.Adora is a direct-to-consumer brand coming straight from the artisans’ manufactures in Vinci (Tuscany), cutting all middlemen and luxury industry markups by allowing Italian family-owned businesses to access the US market directly. WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET We are funding a new batch of Adora for Summer 2018:1.

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>WHAT SETS THE MINI PENNY APART?</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When we created the Mini Penny, there were 3 issues that we wanted to solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Luxury bags cost hundreds or thousands of USD.</strong> Bags are usually marked up 5x-50x the manufacturer cost to cover the high cost of middle men, brick &amp; mortar store locations, and expensive ad campaigns. </li>
<li>
<strong>Bags</strong> <strong>have only one look and cannot be changed</strong>. Is your bag out of style or do you want a different color/style? Too bad. You'll have to go buy another bag and dish out more money. Also, many bags are not convertible and can be carried only one way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Expensive bag collections are</strong> <strong>hard to travel with</strong>. It's hard to fit multiple bags into your luggage without damaging them or ruining their shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mini Penny addresses all of these issues. The Mini Penny:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Supports dozens of looks with modular design &amp; convertible.</strong> The Mini Penny allows for your bag to mix &amp; match with an endless number of styles. It is also convertible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Has no huge markup to cover production &amp; marketing costs</strong>. We sell online directly to our customers. Our savings are reflected in the price tag.</li>
<li>
<strong>Packs easily and is ultra lightweight.</strong> You can pack a dozen looks into your suitcase with one Mini Penny bag and it only weighs a little over 1lb/0.45kg.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're here to disrupt the fashion industry and we need your support to accomplish that. You can make a difference!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY WE ARE PUTTING OUR OWN MONEY ON THE LINE</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe in the potential of the Mini Penny and Penny Heart (our minibag is just the beginning) and we are serious about following up on every one of our promises. A lot of campaigns want to rely on money from backers to cover everything. That is not us. To us, nothing shows dedication more clearly than putting in your own money and that is exactly what we are doing. We've already funded the prototype and now we are covering the majority of the cost of our first production run. We are proud to be a bootstrapped independent studio and we would not be able to do that without the support of our amazing community! </p>
<p>So where do you come in? Why do we need money from IndieGoGo backers?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We're putting in our own money</strong> to cover the majority of material cost and manufacturing fees for the first production run. We still need more to cover all 4 bag colors and, if we hit our stretch goals, maybe even 6 colors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom metal hardware.</strong> We need to make the final molds for production. They are expensive, running about $800-$2500 each.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521862722/fpvg5o8hktftmcys7hd1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>If we manage to exceed either of these funding goals, the corresponding additional color will become available for all perks.</p>

<p><strong>We’re Pen &amp; Vince</strong>, <strong>a wife &amp; husband team from the US &amp; Taiwan. We both share a deep passion for creative design and bags. We’ve spent the past decade working as designers for top film, AR/VR, &amp; entertainment companies. We've spent many years working with manufacturers in the tech &amp; entertainment industry. Now we are applying our skill &amp; creativity to the fashion industry. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Penny Heart was founded when Pen began having difficulty traveling with her nicer bags. Her luggage was always fully packed to the allowed weight limit and she became worried about her handbags getting damaged, having their shape ruined, or getting stolen/lost. Since designer bags are so expensive and we could not afford to buy more of them, Pen was very protective of the ones she had. While traveling for leisure or work, she wanted to bring a few of her nicer bags with her, so she could have multiple looks abroad. However, no matter how strong our luggage was, the airlines always found a way to crack, damage, or lose them entirely. This made both of us lament that designer bags had to be so expensive. Pen would gladly buy more bags from these companies if they were more affordable. Why do women have to pay out so much just to express themselves? </strong></p>
<p><strong>We felt there had to be a better way and sat down to sketch out some ideas. Thus, the Mini Penny and Penny Heart were born. It took 2 years of research and travel, but we have our bag design finalized and our suppliers and manufacturers lined up. All that's left is to find the  first supporters that believe in us and what we are trying to build. </strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Penny Heart and the Mini Penny were named after Pen by Vince. Penny is her nickname and ""I Heart Penny"" became Penny Heart. </strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The biggest risks are delivery time, Duty/VAT, and Customs. While we will do everything in our power to prevent it from happening, there's always a risk that our suppliers may not fulfill on time, affecting delivery time. As a result, we've added some buffer into our delivery time estimate to account for this possibility. For VAT - If you live outside of the US, Australia, Singapore, or Hong Kong, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges. Lastly, regarding customs, some countries are very slow with customs. If you live in one of those countries (if you live in one you are probably aware), prepare for the possibility of a delay.</p>
<p>We'll update everyone frequently about our progress, and if there are any issues along the way, you'll definitely know about them!</p>

When will the bags ship?</strong></p><p>We will begin shipping in late August and early September, so your bags should arrive just in time for fall and well before the Holidays hit.</p><p><strong>3. Why are your bags priced so cheaply? Are you using cheaper materials?</strong></p><p>Nope. We use only the best leather, fabrics, and metal that are available. Our materials are better than those used by some of the top luxury brands &amp; come from some of the best suppliers in the world. The difference is that we are not bogged down with a large corporation and do have to cover the cost of stores, middle men, and advertising campaigns.

STRETCH GOAL COLORS
 

 
The Mini Penny is the world's first convertible, modular luxury bag for women! Traditional luxury bags are expensive, costing hundreds or thousands of USD and only offer one look. The Mini Penny is here to give women what they've always wanted: a luxury bag that is affordable & high-quality and will dress up to them! 
 
 
 


 
 
CORE FEATURES
 


Modular Bag Design – Mix & match to create multiple looks for your OOTD

High Quality Materials – Genuine Italian leather, premium fabrics, and YKK zippers

Convertible - 4 different ways to carry the Mini Penny

Adaptable - Why pay hundreds or thousands to get a luxury bag that will eventually go out of style? The Mini Penny can adapt and reflect the latest trends.

 

 
WHAT SETS THE MINI PENNY APART?
 
When we created the Mini Penny, there were 3 issues that we wanted to solve.


Luxury bags cost hundreds or thousands of USD. Bags are usually marked up 5x-50x the manufacturer cost to cover the high cost of middle men, brick & mortar store locations, and expensive ad campaigns. 

Bags have only one look and cannot be changed. Is your bag out of style or do you want a different color/style? Too bad. You'll have to go buy another bag and dish out more money. Also, many bags are not convertible and can be carried only one way.

Expensive bag collections are hard to travel with. It's hard to fit multiple bags into your luggage without damaging them or ruining their shape.

The Mini Penny addresses all of these issues. The Mini Penny:


Supports dozens of looks with modular design & convertible. The Mini Penny allows for your bag to mix & match with an endless number of styles. It is also convertible.

Has no huge markup to cover production & marketing costs. We sell online directly to our customers. Our savings are reflected in the price tag.

Packs easily and is ultra lightweight. You can pack a dozen looks into your suitcase with one Mini Penny bag and it only weighs a little over 1lb/0.45kg.

We're here to disrupt the fashion industry and we need your support to accomplish that. You can make a difference!

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 


   
 
MATCH WITH YOUR OUTFIT OF THE DAY
 



 
 
HOLLYWOOD SUPPORTERS
 
The Mini Penny has started to get some support in Hollywood. Members of the Stranger Things cast and The Voice have taken a liking to our bag and will be wearing them on the set and at promotional events soon!
 

 

WHY WE ARE PUTTING OUR OWN MONEY ON THE LINE
 
We believe in the potential of the Mini Penny and Penny Heart (our minibag is just the beginning) and we are serious about following up on every one of our promises. A lot of campaigns want to rely on money from backers to cover everything. That is not us. To us, nothing shows dedication more clearly than putting in your own money and that is exactly what we are doing. We've already funded the prototype and now we are covering the majority of the cost of our first production run. We are proud to be a bootstrapped independent studio and we would not be able to do that without the support of our amazing community! 
So where do you come in? Why do we need money from IndieGoGo backers?


We're putting in our own money to cover the majority of material cost and manufacturing fees for the first production run. We still need more to cover all 4 bag colors and, if we hit our stretch goals, maybe even 6 colors.

Custom metal hardware. We need to make the final molds for production. They are expensive, running about $800-$2500 each.


 
STRETCH GOAL COLORS
 

 
If we manage to exceed either of these funding goals, the corresponding additional color will become available for all perks.
1. Over $30,000 - Baby Blue color becomes available
2. Over $40,000 - Pastel Pink color becomes available
 

 

We’re Pen & Vince, a wife & husband team from the US & Taiwan. We both share a deep passion for creative design and bags. We’ve spent the past decade working as designers for top film, AR/VR, & entertainment companies. We've spent many years working with manufacturers in the tech & entertainment industry. Now we are applying our skill & creativity to the fashion industry. 
Penny Heart was founded when Pen began having difficulty traveling with her nicer bags. Her luggage was always fully packed to the allowed weight limit and she became worried about her handbags getting damaged, having their shape ruined, or getting stolen/lost. Since designer bags are so expensive and we could not afford to buy more of them, Pen was very protective of the ones she had. While traveling for leisure or work, she wanted to bring a few of her nicer bags with her, so she could have multiple looks abroad. However, no matter how strong our luggage was, the airlines always found a way to crack, damage, or lose them entirely. This made both of us lament that designer bags had to be so expensive. Pen would gladly buy more bags from these companies if they were more affordable. Why do women have to pay out so much just to express themselves? 
We felt there had to be a better way and sat down to sketch out some ideas. Thus, the Mini Penny and Penny Heart were born. It took 2 years of research and travel, but we have our bag design finalized and our suppliers and manufacturers lined up. All that's left is to find the  first supporters that believe in us and what we are trying to build. 
 

Penny Heart and the Mini Penny were named after Pen by Vince. Penny is her nickname and ""I Heart Penny"" became Penny Heart. 
We can’t thank you enough for your support! You are helping us launch Penny Heart and without you that wouldn't be possible.
 
 

RISKS & CHALLENGES
 
The biggest risks are delivery time, Duty/VAT, and Customs. While we will do everything in our power to prevent it from happening, there's always a risk that our suppliers may not fulfill on time, affecting delivery time. As a result, we've added some buffer into our delivery time estimate to account for this possibility. For VAT - If you live outside of the US, Australia, Singapore, or Hong Kong, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges. Lastly, regarding customs, some countries are very slow with customs. If you live in one of those countries (if you live in one you are probably aware), prepare for the possibility of a delay.
We'll update everyone frequently about our progress, and if there are any issues along the way, you'll definitely know about them!
 

REFERRAL PROGRAM

1. Bring in $150 of backing = FREE Keychain Charm 
2. Bring in $1,000 of backing = also receive FREE Mini Penny x1 Perk 
3. Bring in $2,500 of backing = also receive FREE Mini Penny x1 Perk + Keychain Charm

When will the bags ship?We will begin shipping in late August and early September, so your bags should arrive just in time for fall and well before the Holidays hit.3. Why are your bags priced so cheaply? Are you using cheaper materials?Nope. We use only the best leather, fabrics, and metal that are available. Our materials are better than those used by some of the top luxury brands & come from some of the best suppliers in the world. The difference is that we are not bogged down with a large corporation and do have to cover the cost of stores, middle men, and advertising campaigns. We also are not greedy and we are intentionally not marking our prices highly as most other fashion companies would. If our bags came out of the factory with a luxury brand name on them, they would instantly cost at least 3x our full retail price. 4. Where are your bags made?Our leather and fabric materials are shipped directly from our suppliers in Italy. Our bags are assembled in Hong Kong with a manufacturer that makes bags for Tumi, Coach, Michael Kors, and Tory Burch.

If there is a problem due to a manufacturer's defect, we will replace your Mini Penny.7.  Are you planning to offer more colors soon?Color choice and style variety are both essential to the Mini Penny's chances of success. If we are able to hit our stretch goals, we will have 6 colors at launch. Within the year, we hope to release 2-4 new colors and flap/strap sets each season.8. Are these the final bags?The bags shown in our Indiegogo images are all prototype bags. The final bag that ships will look the same, but will have more luxurious metal hardware.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

functional and innovative.  Now, makers strategically create a collection to select and suit our individual
styles.  But, the desire to own the
entire suite is very costly. 
Personalization is also limited to changing straps and bands.  For many that engage in active lifestyle,
smartwatches still require enhanced protection. 
Fast technology easily out-trends device aesthetics.  Craving for newness, means buying every new
launches. This is why Wristbrain
created Wristmate. OUR VALUE PROPOSITION
Wristmate is a premium case and strap system for
your smartwatch that allows you to build your own collection &
protection.  Whichever way you want,  without breaking the bank.
Wristmate not only lets you customize
straps and bands, but case and bezels too. 
So you can make your smartwatch even more personal in any event you
participate in.  Anytime you need to!WRISTMATE’S DIFFERENTIATOR
Wristmate is the first true mate
for your smartwatch. It is a product of artistry applied in engineering. It is
designed from the ground up, respecting the original smartwatch
design
quality.  Others approach their product
design as a component of an existing case assembly.  Wristmate’s
design methodology starts by re-engineering the whole case and strap
system.  Then making sure each component
seamlessly complement the overall design language.PRODUCT LINES Wristmate currently comes in three variants to get you started.SHIELD – is the rugged, masculine, military-grade line for extreme outdoor activities.GAME – is the sporty variant that lets you play with colors to match your sport.LUSH –  is the choice if you wish to look elegant and glamorous in a special eventPERKSPRICE COMPARISON FOR SIMILAR SYSTEMSPRODUCT FEATURES
Highly fashionable – allows you to match various fashion profiles, colors, and trends
Interchangeable - easy-to-swap case and strap system



Delightful protection – protects and enhances smartwatch aesthetics
Made of premium materials
MECHANICAL SPECIFICATIONSPREMIUM QUALITY, MATERIALS & FINISHES
The cases are forged and CNC-machined so
every detail can be executed precisely. 
Tremendous effort and concurrent engineering were undertaken to ensure
the manufacturer understands the design & engineering requirements fully.  Then the appropriate fabrication processes
are identified and agreed.  This achieves
perfect execution while minimizing scrap loses, thus cost.MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONSWHY TRUST WRISTBRAIN?
Designing, engineering and manufacturing
products are our passion.  We had been
doing this for global companies for years. 
However,  the desire of eventually
making our
own products had
always been at the back of our minds. 
This drove us to form the team of artists, engineers, innovators, developers,
manufacturers and visionaries. So
we can freely utilize our talents, skills and experience, to inspire people,
create opportunities and change lives.
Our core competencies include product
execution, supply chain management and manufacturing innovation.STATUS AND TIMELINE




WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP?To make Wristmate a reality, we need to commence production tooling development. But this means paying for tools and fixtures  and high volume material order. This is where we need your support. And we need you to be part of it. Together, we can make it happen!
WHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO


RISKS AND CHALLENGES
With the number of product variants and customization options available for Wristmate, initial market demand forecast is unpredictable. 
However, in order to mitigate such level of demand uncertainty, we've made sure that our supplier will have enough raw materials, resources and flexible line setup allotted for Wristmate products. Although, the overall goal of Wristmate is to have as much customization options as possible, we've initially limit the number of styles to a manageable level. This is to ensure you get your Wristmate on time at the highest quality.THE TEAM",27.0,1,"1 Campaign

so much for reading my campaign page here on INDIEGOGO. I'd like to 
give you a bit more of my history so you can better understand where 
SLIM42 came from.
An Italian Master-Craftsman's Answer to the Modern Age</p><p>My name is 
Andrea Palama and as a watch craftsman of 25 years I set myself a goal 
of creating a unique set of watches for the modern age. I wanted these 
watches to spark curiosity, be comfortable and still maintain that air 
of style that I love about Italian timepieces.</p><p>Our on-the-go 
lifestyle means most watches are ignored today, but SLIM-42 will get you
 noticed and may spark a conversation. I hope you like what I've created
 as much as I've enjoyed making them, and I hope together we can make 
SLIM-42 come to life.</p><p>Hope to see you join our project! </p><div>

so much for reading my campaign page here on INDIEGOGO. I'd like to 
give you a bit more of my history so you can better understand where 
SLIM42 came from.
An Italian Master-Craftsman's Answer to the Modern AgeMy name is 
Andrea Palama and as a watch craftsman of 25 years I set myself a goal 
of creating a unique set of watches for the modern age. I wanted these 
watches to spark curiosity, be comfortable and still maintain that air 
of style that I love about Italian timepieces.Our on-the-go 
lifestyle means most watches are ignored today, but SLIM-42 will get you
 noticed and may spark a conversation. I hope you like what I've created
 as much as I've enjoyed making them, and I hope together we can make 
SLIM-42 come to life.Hope to see you join our project! 
The SLIM42 CLASSICI had a lot of fun with this one. Don't 
want a watch that conforms to social norms? Want something that's 
completely different and can't help but pop out at you. Say hello to the
 SLIM42 classic. Shirt / Jeans / Suit, you make the rules.The 
SLIM42 classics is also made of very high quality Polycarbonate (the same
 used in the iPhone, HTC and Sony Smartphones). It's just as thin as the
 SLIM42 Steel but this one also incredibly light.SLIM42 CLASSIC IS SUPER SOFTThe SLIM42-BANDOkay
 I couldn't help myself, I had to add in a little more style. So with 
the SLIM42 Band, I took the same designs of the SLIM42 Classic but added
 in a customizable chain link band.

Are you tired your umbrella breaking in a small gust of wind? We are! That’s why we had to think of a solution, and we found it: Beau Nuage!Beau Nuage is a revolutionary solution which will make your life easier when the weather is rainy! We have developed a high quality, folding umbrella and its self-drying cover. No more inconvenience when the weather is wet: you can store your umbrella directly inside its cover to dry and put it straight into your bag!  Beau Nuage is not a simple umbrella, this is a revolutionary project, bringing several innovations together to make your life easier. Rainy days will become happy days!  Beau Nuage is a high quality umbrella you can slip in a revolutionary zipped cover. Thanks to a three-layer technology, our cover absorbs the raindrops and keeps your umbrella always dry.
The inner ""absorption"" layer is made of a special, microfiber fabric which retains water and will absorb the raindrops from your umbrella.
The second intermediate ""repulsive"" layer made from water-repellent material keeps the outer layer dry by preventing raindrops to go through, but it also constantly pulls raindrops towards the microfiber to ventilate it and dry it efficiently.
An outer layer made of polyester which was specially altered to be both rigid, soft and of course hydrophobic so that no raindrop can penetrate the cover from the outside.
 Foldable umbrellas are often badly designed, made from cheap materials and are not able to withstand varying weather conditions. In order to avoid these problems the materials we have used have been chosen meticulously, ensuring each umbrella is robust and made to a high quality. The umbrella itself is made using strong and innovative materials, including aluminium and steel shafts as well as aluminium reinforced fiberglass ribs. These materials are durable, strong and light-weight. This optimizes the resistance to strong winds and helps to prevent the umbrella from turning inside out. The canopy material is thicker than the standard umbrella and its TEFLON coating repels water more effectively. Moreover, the Beau Nuage team pays special attention to the quality control of our products with every single umbrella being checked at each stage of the production. Our priority is your satisfaction.    We are excited to introduce a new collection which includes four new colours which have featured on the catwalks for Spring/Summer 2017. Not only have we enhanced our design we have also improved the materials used and the mechanism of the umbrella. It is with the help of our faithful community and customers that we have been able to improve our concept and ultimately create a better product. Meet it right now!      We now need you to help us to pursue our dream. Your contributions will help to cover the R&D research costs and to pay the deposit to launch the production ensuring we meet the minimum order quantities for the first production batch. Beau Nuage was created by two young entrepreneurs, who one rainy evening in London decided to reinvent the concept of the modern umbrella. Now, Beau Nuage is a dynamic team of 4 and we have help from our friends all over the world! Aurélien and Antoine make up an incredible pair! Energetic, enthusiastic and passionate about entrepreneurship, they decided to create their own business.

<h3>My Plan For This Campaign.</h3> <p>My name is Ron and i run the FOX WORKSHOP, I am 35 and live in Edinburgh with my growing family and i have a keen eye for great outdoor gear. Being a prepper for most of life i tend to see what gear is necessary and what can mean the difference between life and death in given situations.</p>
<p>I am proud to be launching the FOX BOX after the successful trial period that really blow my expectations out the water with the public response. </p>
<p>I am Launching the UK's biggest and best monthly subscription box for Bushcrafters, Preppers and Survivalists packed each month with great new gear for a super low price. For your money each month you will get between £55-£60+ worth of new gear from your FOX BOX, Nice. </p>
<p>The best part is the box is a mystery every month all you know is that it is full of great new QUALITY gear including hand crafted items made by myself and other expert Artisans.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The Next FOX BOX will arrive in the first week in MARCH 2016, this is to allow me time to promote the Indiegogo campaign and also set up a new time line for ordering and sending the boxes out at the start of the month rather than the end.</p>

</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The risks and challenges i think i have worked out during the 3 month trial changes and lesson learned are listed below. </div> <ul>
<li>The risks i have already run into are mainly with ensure imported items are giving more time to clear customs and to expect to pick them up with duties to pay.</li>
<li>Gather more info like wasit size, t shirt size and what hand you use for writing etc to get items in the boxes that will fit and offer more gear options for customers.</li>
<li>Do not use a set date for delivery as often last minute changes are made to increase the box value that may add on a few days and i would rather not make people uneasy if the set day is missed by a few days. Rather i will send the boxes out within a set 2 week window at the start of each month.</li>
<li>Use cut off times for the ""NEXT"" box so i have time to get the best items ready for posting.</li>
<li>Maintaining quality hand crafted items and expanding outside of the FOX Workshop to other artisans worldwide.</li>
<li>Maintain a method of forward planning for the boxes ensuring i stay ahead each month allowing more time for researching new items released each month.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Take A Look Inside The Trial FOX Boxes.





My Plan For This Campaign. My name is Ron and i run the FOX WORKSHOP, I am 35 and live in Edinburgh with my growing family and i have a keen eye for great outdoor gear. Being a prepper for most of life i tend to see what gear is necessary and what can mean the difference between life and death in given situations.
I am proud to be launching the FOX BOX after the successful trial period that really blow my expectations out the water with the public response. 
I am Launching the UK's biggest and best monthly subscription box for Bushcrafters, Preppers and Survivalists packed each month with great new gear for a super low price. For your money each month you will get between £55-£60+ worth of new gear from your FOX BOX, Nice. 
The best part is the box is a mystery every month all you know is that it is full of great new QUALITY gear including hand crafted items made by myself and other expert Artisans.



By contributing to this campaign you with help me take the FOX BOX to the next stage and take this business forward. you will be helping set up:


New Website with new features for FOX BOX subscribers so you can manage your subscription much easier and with more options.

Create great new inserts in full colour each month (100% recycled paper).
Set up a Reseller section for users to promote the FOX BOX and get rewarded for it.
Increase the subscriber count that will allow more buying each month for ever better content and more value handed over to you.
Upgrade camera equipment for demo videos on box contents and how to use the gear all filmed outside.
   What You Will Get Out Of It. If you choose to support me on this campaign you will be offered great savings and also great hand crafted Artisan leather work created by Myself within the FOX Workshop.
The Next FOX BOX will arrive in the first week in MARCH 2016, this is to allow me time to promote the Indiegogo campaign and also set up a new time line for ordering and sending the boxes out at the start of the month rather than the end.
A Mystery box of survival greatness every month - Kinda like a mini christmas.





Handmade Reward Tiers....And, Well Stickers

Super Awesome stickers slap your FOX heads on your gear and show off to your mates just how much cooler than them you are!
After the feedback form the second trial box that included a hand made belt pouch i have added this to a reward tie also. The hunter series EDC belt pouch usually costs £30 and is made from 3.5mm veg tan and is hand dyed and cut and punch as always. It is stitched by hand with artificial sinew. It includes a tin also your with the next FOR BOX for £50. Limited amount.


Exclusive double pin brass buckled bushcraft belt hand cut punched and dyed to a antique finish. Made by the FOX WORKSHOP in Scotland. Usual Belt Price £55, Available with the next FOX BOX included for £70.
FOX Workshop messenger bag reward limited to 5. This is a hand made 14x10x4 3.5mm veg tan and north american deer hide satchel. It has a woven adjustable strap and also closes with a AlpineAustin cobra buckle. It also has a hand laced front flap and is fitted with hand cast brass d'rings on the rear for the strap. Usual messenger bag price £250 - Yours with the next FOX BOX Included for £230.


    Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges i think i have worked out during the 3 month trial changes and lesson learned are listed below.  
The risks i have already run into are mainly with ensure imported items are giving more time to clear customs and to expect to pick them up with duties to pay.
Gather more info like wasit size, t shirt size and what hand you use for writing etc to get items in the boxes that will fit and offer more gear options for customers.
Do not use a set date for delivery as often last minute changes are made to increase the box value that may add on a few days and i would rather not make people uneasy if the set day is missed by a few days. Rather i will send the boxes out within a set 2 week window at the start of each month.
Use cut off times for the ""NEXT"" box so i have time to get the best items ready for posting.
Maintaining quality hand crafted items and expanding outside of the FOX Workshop to other artisans worldwide.
Maintain a method of forward planning for the boxes ensuring i stay ahead each month allowing more time for researching new items released each month.

Now with 5 of us on my team, our aim is not only to create an – ideally – successful product, but also a sunglass brand; an eye-wear laboratory that, in close collaboration with the brand’s consumers, seeks to find innovative and unconventional solutions to real problems.Join our dream and let’s explore our vision together! How can I make changes to my order? Simply contact us at info@moonshades.com. We will do anything we can to address the changes you requested.  When will I receive my MOONSHADES? The sunglasses ship in August of 2016.  Do you have any special offers? Yes, we have an early bird perk of which 40 are available. It’s a limited time offer, don’t miss your chance! How can I choose the lens color for my Early Bird perks? If you purchase an Early Bird perk, you can choose from two lens colors: Sienna Brown and Forest Gray. Mirror lenses not available in the Early Bird perks. Once you purchase an Early Bird perk, we will contact you via email so that you can choose from the two available lens colors.  Do you ship internationally? We ship to the USA, Canada, and to the following European countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. If you are from any other country of the world, send us an e-mail and we will figure something out so that you are not left without your MOONSHADES!  Do all frames float on water? Yes, all of our frames float on water. You can choose Atlas, Cassini, Kasper or Moro – none of them will sink. What’s included in the perks?They include the frame and lens of your choice, a case and a wipe. The concept art mirror perk doesn’t include the previously mentioned items.  Are prescription lenses available?Not at the moment, but once our webshop goes live you can order your MOONSHADES with prescription lenses. Will my eyes be safe when I wear MOONSHADES? Yes, most definitely! All of our lenses are high-quality polarized lenses with UV-400 protection.  What lens tints can I choose from?We offer lenses in four colors: sienna-brown, forest-gray, blue mirror and silver mirror.  What exactly does the lifetime warranty mean? We offer lifetime warranty on our frames. Although every sunglass is made by hand and thus receives special attention, mistakes can happen. Our lifetime warranty includes coverage for any problems that may occur during the manufacturing process (e.g., deterioration of the frame), but does not cover the lenses or intentional damage to the frame (e.g., cutting the frame in half, dipping it in acid).  Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at: General: info@moonshades.com Press and Business: gabor@moonshades.com",30.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>We are Istoría, a clothing line influenced moments in history or interesting places around the world. </p>
<p>Our founders, Rachael and Will Forster, both come from a fashion background but from very different parts. Racheal is the daughter of a retired designer and a seamstress, and started her work in styling, blogging, and sewing early on in life. Will stumbled into fashion through digital marketing and branding. He runs his own consulting group working with mostly fashion companies where he interacts with CEOs, ad agencies, and fashion influencers. Ultimately, it was his desire for creative expression that began his journey to begin Istoría.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>From the Founders</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For a long time, we lusted after high quality, expensive pieces that were far beyond the amount of money we could spend. We started thinking about it, and before long, Rachael discovered that she could make them herself. </p>
<p>That's where the idea for Istoría was born. Ready to wear, at an affordable price point, with couture influences. We are both inspired by our travels and history, so the line has taken on influences from history. While the inspiration for each collection will change, one thing that will not: the quality. </p>
<p>The cuts and silhouettes are classic and flatter essentially all body types. The fabrics are high-quality and chosen for comfortable. The pieces in the collection are designed for elegance, fine detail and beauty. We aim to provide a top-notch customer experience, and will donate 10% of our profit from each collection to charity.</p>
<p>All of this, however, comes with a cost. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $10,000 dollars to make this dream come true. This will provide seed money to fund our initial production run, build inventory, and set the brand up for long-term growth.</p>
<p>We're offering a range of perks from pieces in the collection, framed versions of our lookbook images, a coffee table book of photography from our trip to Scotland, and even the chance to accompany us on our next lookbook shoot.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will still be used to get Istoría up and running.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We could never invest our time and energy into something we didn't love or feel would contribute to the world.  </p>
<p>Working on the retail and styling end, we both have seen the difference fashion can make in people's lives. We love that a woman can put on a jacket and feel prepared to take on the board room, slip on a dress with a swipe of lipstick and feel sexy for her date, or put on a regal jumpsuit and feel like a queen. We are offering high quality, unique pieces that help women achieve that confidence for a price point not much higher than a lot of fast fashion stores.</p>
<p>Our Fall '16 collection is inspired by Scotland and Mary Queen of Scots. Both are very representative of beauty, mystique, tenacity, and strength that we believe live inside every woman. </p>
<p>Giving back is a core value of Istoría, which is why 10% of profit of each collection will be donated to a non-profit organization that will change each season. As we grow as a company, we hope to find new ways to help the world. It takes many hands to run a successful business, and we see each pair as have the potential to give back to the world. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<p>There are some risks in starting a clothing line. We worry that people won't care about yet another clothing brand, or that they will disregard a new brand in a saturated market. Garments get made incorrectly, deliveries get delayed. A million things can go wrong in the apparel business, and we recognize these challenges in starting our dream company. </p>
<p>We have the experience to make sure that the funds we raise will be used wisely, and we will deliver quality and value to our backers. Furthermore, we will continue to create content that we hope inspires people. </p>
</div>
<div>It is definitely scary to begin this entrepreneurial venture, as there are dozens of important decisions to make each day, and dozens of ways things can go wrong. Nevertheless, it's hugely rewarding, as we are building what we believe can be an iconic brand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So...you don't have two pennies to rub together. That's okay. We still appreciate the love and there are other ways to show it to us.</p>
<p>Share this on your social pages. Let's get a buzz going. Let's get people excited about a new movement in fashion designed to cater to every woman. Just hit one of the share buttons on the page. </p>
<p>Email us with creative ideas! We're open to new ways that we can show our clothing or have our company interact with different communities. </p>
<p>Are you a blogger or a street style influencer?</p>

For a long time, we lusted after high quality, expensive pieces that were far beyond the amount of money we could spend. We started thinking about it, and before long, Rachael discovered that she could make them herself. 
That's where the idea for Istoría was born. Ready to wear, at an affordable price point, with couture influences.

Giving back is a core value of Istoría, which is why 10% of profit of each collection will be donated to a non-profit organization that will change each season. As we grow as a company, we hope to find new ways to help the world. It takes many hands to run a successful business, and we see each pair as have the potential to give back to the world.    Risks & Challenges

There are some risks in starting a clothing line. We worry that people won't care about yet another clothing brand, or that they will disregard a new brand in a saturated market. Garments get made incorrectly, deliveries get delayed. A million things can go wrong in the apparel business, and we recognize these challenges in starting our dream company. 
We have the experience to make sure that the funds we raise will be used wisely, and we will deliver quality and value to our backers. Furthermore, we will continue to create content that we hope inspires people. 

It is definitely scary to begin this entrepreneurial venture, as there are dozens of important decisions to make each day, and dozens of ways things can go wrong. Nevertheless, it's hugely rewarding, as we are building what we believe can be an iconic brand.

And guess what – unsold items that do get donated to second-hand stores also get thrown into landfills if they are not sold quickly due to high volumes of donations.</p><p>Brands even set fire to unsold merchandise to “preserve its reputation of exclusivity”.  There has been reports of one very well-known brand, burning $36.8 million worth in a year of their own inventory to keep their luxury brand out of the hands of non-luxury people.  (I can’t make this up, google it!)</p><p><strong>OUR SOLUTION</strong><br/>Our garments and accessories do not exist yet.  Right now, that angel shirt sitting in your virtual shopping cart is still one big piece of fabric, still on a cardboard roll.  We do not manufacture your item till we find a home for it to claim.

And guess what – unsold items that do get donated to second-hand stores also get thrown into landfills if they are not sold quickly due to high volumes of donations.Brands even set fire to unsold merchandise to “preserve its reputation of exclusivity”.  There has been reports of one very well-known brand, burning $36.8 million worth in a year of their own inventory to keep their luxury brand out of the hands of non-luxury people.  (I can’t make this up, google it!)OUR SOLUTIONOur garments and accessories do not exist yet.  Right now, that angel shirt sitting in your virtual shopping cart is still one big piece of fabric, still on a cardboard roll.  We do not manufacture your item till we find a home for it to claim. As a retailer and design team, we pride ourselves in limited production.We also love second hand!  All of our 1of1 pieces including our embroidered items and revamped vintage bags are created from items that were once loved before from a previous owner.  We rescue these pups from ending up in landfills, give them a good bath, a makeover good enough for a movie montage and finally find them a new home. ISSUEChicago creatives stating there is no work in Chicago.  They feel in order to be successful in their field, they need to move to a larger market.  Therefore, a loss of creatives in the city.OUR SOLUTIONWe are striving to create a Chicago based business that other creatives will look towards for a source of income.  Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, models, graphic designers, fashion designers, creative marketing, writers, content creators – successful business have an endless need for artists.We want to contract artist we believe in.  We want to host internships with multiple opportunities for students and young creatives.  We want to have ongoing collaborations with artists, so their craft and talent can become their 9 to 5.  We want to make a difference in our creative community.ISSUEManufactures ship items to company warehouses in non branded plastic and boxes.  The retailer then discards that plastic and cardboard, and place the item in new branded plastic packaging and then ships your item to you in a new branded box.

Solidly built and easy to work with. The jeweled movement uses synthetic rubies to reduce friction. One of the main reasons for us to use this specific movement is because of its sound. The balance wheel together with the hairspring creates a harmonic oscillating movement when the balance wheel receives impulses from the escape wheel.

Created to be easily maintained to a reasonable price point and from a service standpoint, it´s a great design. The movement itself is very straightforwardly constructed. Solidly built and easy to work with. The jeweled movement uses synthetic rubies to reduce friction. One of the main reasons for us to use this specific movement is because of its sound. The balance wheel together with the hairspring creates a harmonic oscillating movement when the balance wheel receives impulses from the escape wheel. Its characteristic mechanical ticking sound created by the movement is surrounded by a small echo from sound waves bouncing of the steel bezel wall.  For the Perpetual Aston we have chosen a classic columbus black strap. Cut out of soft leather that over time gets a beautiful patina. The monochrome stitching along the edge is matched by the stitching and the embossed branding at the back of the strap. The idea of the columbus black comes from our leather specialist. An older Italian rather charming gentleman who worked in his family’s leather manufacturing business his whole life. He has a strong opinion on how a leather strap should be and, to him, even the simplest leather strap has a whole science behind it. He once said: ”A leather strap must be soft like a girls kiss the first day, loving as her feelings on the third and black as her mothers curse when she finds out.” Therefore all watches we produce comes with a columbus black leather strap    Our valuesWe like to say that passion in a company comes in 360degrees. We are passionate about making a great watch. To do so we must also be passionate in sourcing some great component producers. We care about who we work with and how they in turn treat their employees. In some cases, we work with small local producers. They may not be the fastest producers, they may not be the least expensive producers. But they all have one thing in common. They are passionate about the things they produce, in what they do. The small leather producer that helps us to make, what we think is, the best leather strap, or our specialist metal producer that helps us making a particularly high grade of steel case.   Have a question? Send us an email at dist@esterwatches.com and we'll be in touch as soon as possible.5 years warrantyWe believe in sustainability and quality. We are proud to offer a 5 years worldwide limited warranty. Every Ester watch is guaranteed for a period of 5 years under the terms and conditions of our warranty. We're able to offer this guarantee because of our rigorous testing that ensures that every timepiece shipped from us has a five star marking in our testing procedure.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

Parte dei proventi raccolti durante questa campagna di crowdfunding verrà, infatti, devoluta a DoppiaDifesa Onlus, in favore delle sue attività a sostegno delle vittime di violenza.Quanti tabù, luoghi comuni e cliché vengono ancora oggi associati alla vagina? Lanuvelvag si propone di rispondere alla paura con il colore: per questo il simbolo di tutta la linea sarà un tratto grafico iconico e minimale che ricorda l’apparato genitale femminile, in modo semplice e mai volgare, estremamente pop. Crediamo che la migliore arma contro l’ignoranza non sia un’arma, ma l’ironia.Se è vero che la vagina è la cosa più naturale del mondo, perché non indossarla?Caratteristiche differenziali del prodotto saranno l’attenzione per la qualità - le nostre t-shirt sono tutte Made in Italy in cotone biologico 100% - e l’altissimo livello di personalizzazione: non c’è vag che sia uguale a un’altra, proprio come le persone. Sì, rispettiamo le diversità!Avremo, quindi, vag monocromatiche, ma anche grafiche, disegnate, illustrate. Lanuvelvag è favorevole alla “fantasia libera” e per questo aprirà collaborazioni sia con artisti affermati che con giovani emergenti, con l’obiettivo di inserire sempre nuove vag nelle sue collezioni.Essendo anche un brand democratico per sua natura e digital oriented,  Lanuvelvag lancerà contest stagionali aperti a tutti, attraverso cui gli utenti potranno proporre le loro opere (di disegno, pittura, illustrazione, fotografia…) alla community del sito così che le più votate entreranno in produzione.Abbiamo grandi progetti per il futuro, ma andremo per step, condividendo ogni passo con voi.Con questa raccolta fondi Lanuvelvag potrà diventare una Srl e iniziare la produzione della sua prima linea di abbigliamento, che verrà distribuita tramite un sito di e-commerce, un’applicazione per smartphone e tablet, un temporary store e una rete capillare di negozi per la rivendita sul territorio. Con questa raccolta fondi Lanuvelvag potrà, anche, fare del bene: oltre a donare il 15% del budget a DoppiaDifesa Onlus, proseguiremo la nostra finalità charity individuando diverse associazioni a cui donare in maniera continuativa parte dei proventi derivanti dalla futura attività commerciale.Lanuvelvag è un progetto nato ad aprile di quest’anno dalle menti di sei creativi provenienti da diversi mondi - la grafica, la scrittura, la moda, l’editoria - ma tutti digital oriented e uniti da forti idee comuni.Vogliamo ringraziare tutti gli influencer che ci stanno aiutando a diffondere il progetto e contribuire così al lancio del brand e al supporto di DoppiaDifesa Onlus. Andrea Sartori - Videomaker Elenonora Sabet - Ph Daiana Lou - Music Clizia Incorvaia - Model Elena Bonamico - Model Michela Bertuletti - Model Filippo Tabbi - Model Lorenzo Carone Marco Avvisati - Model Le Donatella - Influencer Nina Palmieri - Influencer  Arisa - Influencer Ilaria Rastrelli - Influencer Giulia Luzi - Influencer Sara Puccinelli - Influencer Juri Bavaresco - Influencer Nico Morani - Influencer Sem&Stènn - Influencer Marco Specchia - Influncer  Roberta Riccio - Influencer Denise D'Angelilli - Influencer Luana Abroad - Blogger Alessandro Malossi - Designer Mattia Distaso - Illustrator Serena Gianoli - Illustrator Danipas - Illustrator Alessandro Razzini - Illustrator Francesco Caporale - Illustrator Marco Del Santo - Composer Pick Up The Vinyl - Radio Nuova Elgo - Official supplier LAeX - Event Planner Arvi's - Hairstylist Feodora Make-Up ArtistLanuvelvag non poteva che essere super-iper-extra-social!

They have spent the past two years crafting a product they would be proud to share with their family and friends.  To honor their family members that inspired TRELAWEAR, the cushion-shaped pendant was named Sally, after Mara’s mother; and the round-shaped pendant named Lilly, after Anthony’s grandmother.  The TeamMara Perlmutter: With 30+ years experience, beginning as a buyer for Saks Fifth Avenue to Group President at Jones Jewelry Group, Mara is a leader and expert in the design, development, and retail of luxury and contemporary fashion jewelry accessories. She has led merchandising and design for global brands including Givenchy, Anne Klein, French Connection, Laundry by Shelli Segal, Judith Jack, 9West, Isaac Mizrahi and Christian Siriano. Based upon her vast experience Mara inspired the designs and development of the TRELAWEAR collection. Anthony Pucci:  With 15+ years experience, Anthony has specialized in launching new brands and product lines within the jewelry and watch industry. From developing marketing plans and creative, to retail and wholesale rollouts, his experience has helped create the internal and external execution of TRELAWEAR. His most notable launches of watches include MOMO Design, Officina Del Tempo, Tommy Hilfiger, Juicy Couture, and jewelry: Rebecca, Roasto, Calgaro, and Oscar de la Renta.  Why We’re Here...We’ve spent the last two years designing, prototyping, and testing TRELAWEAR pendants to the point where we are confident in gifting them to the women we love. We’re FCC certified and have partnered with the best in the business. Now we’re ready for production. To appeal to a wide audience, our goal is to offer our collections at accessible price points. To accomplish this we must purchase materials in bulk and manufacture in quantity. With your help, we can deliver our beautiful pendants at compelling prices so women everywhere can wear our unique PERS accessory. We appreciate your support.  Please share this campaign with your family and friends, offering the perfect gift of safety with style.Share on:Facebook | LinkedIn | Twitter | Google Plus",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Spending an evening on the town, riding your bike, or conducting a meeting in the office, you want to know that you can be yourself. You want people to perceive you a certain way, and to accomplish that, you need to put some thought and energy into your overall look, paying attention to all the minor details. You want to be able to wear something that expresses your personality completely, and you want to be able to move about freely, never worrying about anything embarrassing – anything like, say, a stray tampon string. The last thing that you need is to realize hours later that you have presented an image of yourself that is not in line with<i> your</i> image of yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Introducing: Hidden Note Strips</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583945520/gpxfx0rbijnvcecjm8ip.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Until now, it has been nearly impossible to guarantee that you could hide away your tampon string effectively throughout the entire day. The best that you could do is <i>hope</i> that it would not come loose or flap around. We, however, did not think that was enough. We demanded something <i>more</i> – reliability unlike any you have ever seen before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Toward that end, we have created Hidden Note Strips. These are waterproof adhesive strips that measure approximately an inch in length and that keep your tampon string in place, making stray tampon strings a thing of the past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584040057/lwamjnaemrtrirjncr3q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Hidden Note Strips are easy to use. To get started, you simply press your tampon string against the adhesive side of the Hidden Note Strip, folding along the perforations to hold the string in place. You then stick the Hidden Note Strip and the string to your skin, where our medical-grade adhesive keeps everything together safely and consistently. This ensures that there will be no blush-worthy slip-ups, also optimizing your hygiene by stabilizing your tampon string for you.</p>

<p>On the non-adhesive side of every Hidden Note Strip, there is an inspiring or motivational message, including words like ""love,"" ""hope,"" and ""life."" This way, you get a boost of encouragement any time you apply a new Hidden Note Strip, folding the adhesive over the strip and then reading the message while you are putting it on. In this way, Hidden Note Strips are there to support you in more ways than one – both practically and emotionally.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>- S4P Device attached to the quick locking clip for versatile placement -</i></p>
<p><strong>Our story -</strong></p>
<p>The Scout 4 has been a passion of ours for many years. </p>
<p>S4P was born after I lost Ty (my min-pin) to a car accident after he made his way out the front door one warm summer day. His tracking device was spotty regarding his exact location and the battery ended up dying before we could locate him. A few days later we found him on the side of the road near our home (I truly believe to this day he was making his way back to us). Sadly, he had passed away. Heartbroken and upset I swore to never lose another fluffy best friend. If I only had a location device that the battery lasted the few days while he was lost I could have found him, I could have saved him.</p>
<p>After educating myself on all available pet trackers I quickly realized that battery life was a huge issue. That the industry as a whole has had no-real innovation in the last twenty years. It has remained stagnant with no change in concepts and designs.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong><i>Why are these devices still so big? </i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Why can't we place current device's where we want to place them on our family fluffs? </i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Why do the batteries not last more than a few days?  </i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Why is it so hard to place on and take off for charging? Why are we charging so often?</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Why do they not have any type of LED light source for night location?</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Why do the available devices not charge themselves if our fluff gets loose for more than 48 hours (2 days)?</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Why does the number of pets going lost or missing continue to rise given the increase in the number of pet tracker's available on the market?</i></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The answers were quite simple - </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With current market saturation no-one has taken the time to improve existing devices or implement change. Here at Scout4 we did just that. We have developed the most modern, innovative, and versatile pet location and health monitoring device available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581527843/wu7at7dqbo49f9s08fsy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>- Initial concept sketches -</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Scout4 offers many unique properties in our favor - </p>
<ol>
<li><strong><i>It never needs removed for charging when the complete S4P kit is purchased.</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>The proprietary leash charges the device as you walk your pet.</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>The device's home dock communicates with your S4P device and S4P smart phone app.</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>The device can be placed on a collar, harness, or other pet wearables of the pet parent's choosing via the quick clip.</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>The S4P is small in size, big on power, and available in multiple colors.</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>The solar panel trickle charges the device 24/7 (great for fluffs who are lost for long periods).</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>The S4P device has a built-in Strobe light which you can activate via the app. Making it perfect for finding your fluff in the dark.</i>​</strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Your S4P device can easily slide in and lock to the harness, collar or quick clip in seconds.</i> </strong></li>
<li><u><strong><i>Unmatched Versatility - Clip your Scout4 anywhere -  The S4P comes with a locking quick clip - Clip it to your existing collar, vest, or harness, Yes anywhere you want it. Can be used to locate and monitor all pet types.</i></strong></u></li>

Our story -
The Scout 4 has been a passion of ours for many years. 
S4P was born after I lost Ty (my min-pin) to a car accident after he made his way out the front door one warm summer day. His tracking device was spotty regarding his exact location and the battery ended up dying before we could locate him. A few days later we found him on the side of the road near our home (I truly believe to this day he was making his way back to us). Sadly, he had passed away. Heartbroken and upset I swore to never lose another fluffy best friend. If I only had a location device that the battery lasted the few days while he was lost I could have found him, I could have saved him.
After educating myself on all available pet trackers I quickly realized that battery life was a huge issue. That the industry as a whole has had no-real innovation in the last twenty years. It has remained stagnant with no change in concepts and designs.
 
Why?
 

Why are these devices still so big? 
Why can't we place current device's where we want to place them on our family fluffs? 
Why do the batteries not last more than a few days?  
Why is it so hard to place on and take off for charging? Why are we charging so often?
Why do they not have any type of LED light source for night location?
Why do the available devices not charge themselves if our fluff gets loose for more than 48 hours (2 days)?
Why does the number of pets going lost or missing continue to rise given the increase in the number of pet tracker's available on the market?

The answers were quite simple - 
With current market saturation no-one has taken the time to improve existing devices or implement change. Here at Scout4 we did just that. We have developed the most modern, innovative, and versatile pet location and health monitoring device available.
 

- Initial concept sketches -
 
The Scout4 offers many unique properties in our favor - 

It never needs removed for charging when the complete S4P kit is purchased.
The proprietary leash charges the device as you walk your pet.
The device's home dock communicates with your S4P device and S4P smart phone app.
The device can be placed on a collar, harness, or other pet wearables of the pet parent's choosing via the quick clip.
The S4P is small in size, big on power, and available in multiple colors.
The solar panel trickle charges the device 24/7 (great for fluffs who are lost for long periods).
The S4P device has a built-in Strobe light which you can activate via the app. Making it perfect for finding your fluff in the dark.​
Your S4P device can easily slide in and lock to the harness, collar or quick clip in seconds. 
Unmatched Versatility - Clip your Scout4 anywhere -  The S4P comes with a locking quick clip - Clip it to your existing collar, vest, or harness, Yes anywhere you want it. Can be used to locate and monitor all pet types.

We immediately responded to the call and co-founded O2 Brands Inc.Bringing together our very different expertise, teams, and backgrounds to the project with nothing but belief and hope for the mission and each other.Starting from material selection to manufacturing, we control the entire product design and production process, ensuring that we can continuously deliver products we believe in.We’ve come to the Indiegogo community to fulfill our mission of donating 40,000 masks to local essential workers. At this crucial time, we’ve discovered that both consumers and essential service workers are in need.Together, we’re committing to fulfilling our goal and we would like your support to make it happen.Thank you for supporting and learning about O2 Nano Mask.- Rebecca Cahua, Vivian Qu, and O2 Nano Mask TeamNote:We have strived to create the best mask on the market and are committed to being transparent. No mask is 100% effective at curing or preventing a disease or illness. We created O2 Nano Mask, not as a medical product, but an everyday mask to filter out as many harmful particles as we could whilst being breathable and comfortable enough that it is happily worn for as long as desired.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>","About us
We are friends from Ukraine!!! We have been working to design our own brand of clothing ""SOHO Chic"" for the past 2 years. We have our own cozy boutique that we have operated very successfully in Ukraine for 2 years. We also have clients in places such as London, Dubai and Istanbul.
What we do
Our idea is to create beautiful clothes for perfect moments. We design dresses that make you feel amazing. We want you to feel very special even in everyday life. For our collections, we choose only high-quality and exclusive fabrics and we pay a lot of attention to every detail.
Now we get hundreds of requests  from all over the world to buy our products  through social networks. We have been able to fill many of these orders so far.

</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p>With the technology and infrastructure that we have designed, we are going to be able to solve this with a short direct commercialization channel (Global Retail Network), without intermediaries, without obstacles, without barriers or complicated processes. This channel will allow each Professional in the world to be able to sell his materials, pieces and services globally. And he will be free to set the price he considers fairer for his talent and get a 100% of the set price for the sales of his work. This channel will also benefit retailers and customers with better prices and a greater variety of unique pieces.</p>

<br/>
Authors and Professionals will have a Virtual Storefront (an open window) at each jewelry store, specialized gallery or premium boutique in the world. They will be able to display their creativity, their talent and their work directly and in real time. They will always be backed by a Global Retail Network of Story Partners (community retailers), expert skilled professionals who will help them, give advice and be responsible for promoting and selling their pieces, designs and services, because the Story Partners will also benefit economically from each sale they perform.<br/>

<br/>
<p><b>POR QUÉ ESTA INICIATIVA</b>                                                </p>
<p>En estas últimas décadas las grandes multinacionales han industrializado el lujo, transformando el arte genuino de los Autores en una mera mercancía con la que saturar el mercado con productos estandarizados.</p>
<p>Los Autores han sido escondidos a la sombra de las compañías, su creatividad se ha visto limitada y su talento se ha atribuido a logos de grandes marcas corporativas quitándoles el reconocimiento por su trabajo para ser componentes anónimos de una línea de producción sin fin.</p>
<br/>
</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">Uno de los grandes daños de la producción masiva de artículos de lujo ha sido la pérdida de valores humanos por la falta de contacto entre los Autores y consumidores. En el lujo industrial los productos se fabrican de forma estandarizada en la cadena de producción, después pasan a la cadena de distribución y al final al punto de venta minorista donde al cliente lo atiende una persona que no tiene nada de conexión con los Autores ni afinidad por lo que vende.<br/>

</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p><b>LA OPORTUNIDAD</b></p>
<p>La trazabilidad es una GRAN OPORTUNIDAD para que las pequeñas empresas y profesionales independientes puedan ofrecer una propuesta de valor diferente y ventajosa frente a la oferta de las grandes multinacionales. Competir con ellas siempre ha sido un sueño imposible pero gracias a la transparencia esto ahora puede cambiar. </p>
<p>Es el momento de devolver el protagonismo a las personas que hacen las cosas y mostrar la Historia de su trabajo diario.</p>

<p><b>EL PROBLEMA</b></p>
<p>Los comercios tradicionales de joyería y artículos de lujo siguen anclados en un modelo de negocio industrial que pertenece al pasado, les obliga a amontonar stock e invertir en costoso género que nadie ha solicitado.</p>

<p></p>

<br/><br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p>Los comercios tradicionales son una gran barrera para que los jóvenes diseñadores y  Autores emergentes tengan la oportunidad de ofrecer y vender sus piezas y nuevos diseños. La mayoría de minoristas no están dispuestos a asumir el riesgo que supone invertir en piezas de jóvenes Autores que no tienen reputación demostrada en el mercado. Los materiales innovadores y diseños extravagantes a menudo son automáticamente descartados. </p>
<p>Los Autores independientes aunque tienen un gran potencial comercial por lo original, lo exclusivo y la calidad artesanal de sus piezas son muy débiles frente a las grandes firmas, porque no tienen  la infraestructura y el capital necesario que les permita comercializar directamente sus piezas, posicionar su marca y hacer avanzar su negocio.</p>

<p>Con la tecnología e infraestructura que hemos diseñado lograremos solucionar esto con un canal corto de comercialización directa (Red Comercial Global), sin intermediarios, sin obstáculos, sin barreras ni procesos complicados. Este canal va a permitir que cada profesional pueda comerciar sus materiales, piezas y servicios de forma global y sea libre de poner el precio que considere más justo por su talento y cobre el 100% de las ventas de su trabajo. Este canal también beneficiará a los detallistas y a los clientes con mejores precios y mayor oferta de piezas únicas.</p>

Have you watched the video above? On it we describe the essence of our goals.--------------------------



We reinvent the way in which jewels and  luxury goods are created and distributed, in order to guarantee that the impact is positive on the whole value chain, from obtaining the Raw Materials to the Master Artisans and the Final Customer.
We want to make known the origin of the raw materials to contribute to a sustainable development that respects the environment and the people.
We redefine the value chain of the luxury sector  to narrow the gap between professionals and clients in order to identify new ways of doing things, more sustainable and generating relationships which are fairer and profitable to everyone.
In order to achieve a Transparent Luxury is necessary to create an online collaborative platform for Authors, Professionals and Enterprises, a Global Commercial Network and a Community which is excited about changing things and who love the design and what is artisan and original.  





We are already a community of thousands of professionals united in Facebook and excited to participate on an alternative luxury which is fairer and more Humane. - We believe THE UNION MAKES BIG THOSE WHO ARE SMALL.





FACEBOOK


- FROM HERE YOU CAN SAY HELLO TO US -




























----------------------












And how this will work? aa







Once the piece is finished, its History will be completed. It will become a Certificate of Transparent Luxury, with a unique ID number registered on CJoRe with public or private access (the customer decides):










You can help us by acquiring the reward ""Perk 1"" for just $ 3 and spreading the message of the new #TransparentLuxury. If you are a professional we have other better proposals for you.






If we obtain the necessary funding, we are confident that the first Transparent Jewels will be created from April/2016.

Please help us to return the luxury to its real protagonists in order to get back the values of what is unique, authentic and handmade.



--------------------------














THE PROBLEM



Traditional jewelry stores and other luxury retailers remain anchored in an industrial business model that belongs to the past, which forces them to pile stock and invest in costly items that nobody has requested.









THE NECESSITY
It is necessary to redefine the luxury industry and establish a new logical order shortening the distances between authors, professionals and customers in order to be able to offer consumers a sustainable Alternative Luxury and professionals a future full of new opportunities.






THE SOLUTION


With the technology and infrastructure that we have designed, we are going to be able to solve this with a short direct commercialization channel (Global Retail Network), without intermediaries, without obstacles, without barriers or complicated processes. This channel will allow each Professional in the world to be able to sell his materials, pieces and services globally. And he will be free to set the price he considers fairer for his talent and get a 100% of the set price for the sales of his work. This channel will also benefit retailers and customers with better prices and a greater variety of unique pieces.




Authors and Professionals will have a Virtual Storefront (an open window) at each jewelry store, specialized gallery or premium boutique in the world. They will be able to display their creativity, their talent and their work directly and in real time. They will always be backed by a Global Retail Network of Story Partners (community retailers), expert skilled professionals who will help them, give advice and be responsible for promoting and selling their pieces, designs and services, because the Story Partners will also benefit economically from each sale they perform.
















With this distributed structure we will achieve an agile global organization able to adapt to change much faster and better.





CROWDSOURCING APPLIED TO LUXURY
Crowdsourcing and co-creation are a reality that is revolutionizing the world. Thanks to the collective intelligence of the communities, entire industries are being reinvented and the rules of the current market are changing completely.
Thanks to the Distributed Global Network of Story Partners and the co-creation platform we are going to be able to bring the benefits of the crowdsourcing to the luxury. This is going to allow the CJoRe community to provide personalized Luxury a la carte transparently and under demand.

Crowdsourcing offers a factor of differentiation and competitive advantage to all the Professionals of the CJoRe community, adding the benefits associated to the just-in-time Method(JIT); and on the other hand, it brings a new shopping experience and a customer support process which is collective, innovative, accessible, open and transparent.

--------------------------




















_______________________






If you are a jewelry retailer, owner of a premium boutique or a gallery specialized in Author's luxury items, then this is for YOU. - Become the first Story Partner in your city.













As a Story Partner, you will have access in the cloud to everything you need to take total control of your business from an online dashboard: Accounting, Finance, Sales, HR, Purchasing, Project Managment, Stock, Warehouse, CRM, Campaigns, Logistics, Events, Organizing teams of Authors to create jewelry pieces with History and other Luxury Items a la carte personalized and under demand for each customer without requiring a minimal stock and much more...











QUESTIONS?
If you have questions about anything, please feel free to contact us on:  cjore.help@gmail.com





Together we can give a new meaning to the luxury and then contribute to improve the lives of millions of people and make our planet a better place to live.
If you wish to know more about me, in this original note posted on Facebook on March 15th 2011 I explain better who I am and how it all began.

--------------------------





Reinventamos la manera en la que las joyas y artículos de lujo son creados y distribuidos, con el objetivo de que el impacto sea positivo en toda la cadena de valor, desde la obtención de las Materias Primas, pasando por los Maestros Artesanos, hasta el Cliente Final.


Queremos dar a conocer el origen de los materiales para contribuir a un desarrollo sostenible, respetuoso con el medio ambiente y las personas.
Redefinimos la cadena de valor del lujo para acortar las distancias entre profesionales y clientes para identificar nuevas formas de hacer las cosas, más sostenibles y generar relaciones más justas y provechosas para todos.
Para lograr un Lujo Transparente es necesario crear una plataforma de colaboración online para los Autores, Profesionales y Empresas, una Red Comercial Global y una Comunidad  ilusionada por cambiar las cosas, amantes del diseño, lo artesano y lo original.




Ya somos una comunidad con miles de profesionales reunidos en Facebook ilusionados por participar en crear piezas únicas y un lujo alternativo más justo y humano. - Creemos que LA UNIÓN HACE GRANDES A LOS PEQUEÑOS.

FACEBOOK
- AQUÍ PUEDE SALUDARNOS - 









Autores y Profesionales de todo el mundo van a disponer de un punto de encuentro online con todo lo necesario para desarrollar sus negocios de forma sostenible, colaborar, organizarse, mostrar sus mejores talentos y ofrecer sus obras que podrán ser compradas, comentadas, puntuadas y recomendadas por sus propios compañeros y clientes.





















----------------------






Y ¿cómo va a funcionar?


Con la pieza terminada se dará por finalizada la Historia. Ésta pasará a ser un Certificado de Lujo Transparente, con un numero ID único registrado en CJoRe con acceso público o privado (el cliente lo decide). 
Será posible conocer la Historia online completa de cada pieza, incluso hablar con las personas que la crearon, desde los proveedores de materias primas, pasando por el Diseñador que la imaginó hasta los Maestros Artesanos que la realizaron.
Este innovador sistema convierte cada pieza en única dando lugar a obras exclusivas de las que sólo habrá una en el mundo. 


Un vídeo realizado de forma colaborativa mostrará todos los procesos que hayan sido necesarios para la creación de una pieza y a todas las personas que hayan participado en su realización.






Este sistema va a permitir que los Diseñadores y Artesanos obtengan el reconocimiento que merecen por su trabajo y que el cliente ponga cara y nombre a todas las personas que han participado en todo el proceso de creación.
Humanizando la joyería y el lujo lograremos una experiencia de compra inolvidable y una transparencia absoluta de cada etapa del proceso. Además, el cliente podrá finalizar la historia haciéndose una foto o vídeo con su pieza y publicarla en su correspondiente Historia. De esta forma, los profesionales también tendrán la satisfacción de ver quién disfruta de su obra. 



El cliente ahora también podrá votar y valorar el trabajo realizado por cada uno de los profesionales, comentar y compartir con sus amigos en las redes sociales la experiencia vivida y opinar sobre los servicios y el trato recibido.




Puede ayudarnos adquiriendo la recompensa ""Perk 1"" por tan sólo $3 y difundiendo el mensaje del nuevo #LujoTransparente. Si es profesional tenemos otras propuestas mejores para usted.






Si logramos la financiación necesaria, confiamos que las primeras Joyas Transparentes podrán ser creadas a partir de abril/2016.  
Ayúdenos a devolver el lujo a sus auténticos protagonistas para recuperar los valores de lo único, lo auténtico y lo hecho a mano.



----------------------

POR QUÉ ESTA INICIATIVA                                                
En estas últimas décadas las grandes multinacionales han industrializado el lujo, transformando el arte genuino de los Autores en una mera mercancía con la que saturar el mercado con productos estandarizados.
Los Autores han sido escondidos a la sombra de las compañías, su creatividad se ha visto limitada y su talento se ha atribuido a logos de grandes marcas corporativas quitándoles el reconocimiento por su trabajo para ser componentes anónimos de una línea de producción sin fin.






Uno de los grandes daños de la producción masiva de artículos de lujo ha sido la pérdida de valores humanos por la falta de contacto entre los Autores y consumidores. En el lujo industrial los productos se fabrican de forma estandarizada en la cadena de producción, después pasan a la cadena de distribución y al final al punto de venta minorista donde al cliente lo atiende una persona que no tiene nada de conexión con los Autores ni afinidad por lo que vende.







LA OPORTUNIDAD
La trazabilidad es una GRAN OPORTUNIDAD para que las pequeñas empresas y profesionales independientes puedan ofrecer una propuesta de valor diferente y ventajosa frente a la oferta de las grandes multinacionales. Competir con ellas siempre ha sido un sueño imposible pero gracias a la transparencia esto ahora puede cambiar. 
Es el momento de devolver el protagonismo a las personas que hacen las cosas y mostrar la Historia de su trabajo diario.
 





EL PROBLEMA
Los comercios tradicionales de joyería y artículos de lujo siguen anclados en un modelo de negocio industrial que pertenece al pasado, les obliga a amontonar stock e invertir en costoso género que nadie ha solicitado.






Los comercios tradicionales son una gran barrera para que los jóvenes diseñadores y  Autores emergentes tengan la oportunidad de ofrecer y vender sus piezas y nuevos diseños. La mayoría de minoristas no están dispuestos a asumir el riesgo que supone invertir en piezas de jóvenes Autores que no tienen reputación demostrada en el mercado. Los materiales innovadores y diseños extravagantes a menudo son automáticamente descartados. 
Los Autores independientes aunque tienen un gran potencial comercial por lo original, lo exclusivo y la calidad artesanal de sus piezas son muy débiles frente a las grandes firmas, porque no tienen  la infraestructura y el capital necesario que les permita comercializar directamente sus piezas, posicionar su marca y hacer avanzar su negocio.










LA NECESIDAD
Es necesario redefinir la industria del lujo y establecer un nuevo orden lógico acortando las distancias entre autores, profesionales y clientes para ofrecer a los consumidores un Lujo Alternativo sostenible y a los profesionales un futuro lleno de nuevas oportunidades.




LA SOLUCIÓN
Con la tecnología e infraestructura que hemos diseñado lograremos solucionar esto con un canal corto de comercialización directa (Red Comercial Global), sin intermediarios, sin obstáculos, sin barreras ni procesos complicados. Este canal va a permitir que cada profesional pueda comerciar sus materiales, piezas y servicios de forma global y sea libre de poner el precio que considere más justo por su talento y cobre el 100% de las ventas de su trabajo. Este canal también beneficiará a los detallistas y a los clientes con mejores precios y mayor oferta de piezas únicas.



Autores y Profesionales van a disponer de un Escaparate Virtual (una ventana abierta), en cada joyería, galería especializada o boutique premium del mundo. Van a poder mostrar su creatividad, su talento y sus obras de forma directa y en tiempo real. Siempre respaldados por una Red Comercial Global de Story Partners (detallistas de la comunidad), expertos profesionales cualificados que les ayudarán, aconsejarán y se encargarán de promocionar y vender sus piezas, diseños y servicios, porque ellos también se beneficiarán económicamente de cada venta que realicen.











Las grandes multinacionales del lujo industrial invirtieron miles de millones y tardaron décadas para lograr llevar y ofrecer sus productos de lujo estandarizados a clientes de todo el mundo. Ahora los Autores y Profesionales de la comunidad CJoRe van a lograr lo mismo de una forma rápida, sencilla y muy económica, conectándose unos con otros.
Vamos a disponer de una Red Global Distribuida donde los profesionales se van a poder conectar entre sí sin que tengan que pasar necesariamente por ningún intermediario central.




Con esta estructura distribuida lograremos una organización global ágil que se adaptará al cambio mucho más rápido y mejor. 




CROWDSOURCING APLICADO AL LUJO 
El Crowdsourcing y la Co-creación, son una realidad que está revolucionando el mundo, gracias a la inteligencia colectiva de las comunidades se están reinventando industrias enteras y cambiando por completo las reglas de juego del mercado actual. 
Gracias a la Red Global Distribuida de Story Partners y a la plataforma de co-creación vamos a poder llevar los beneficios del crowdsourcing al lujo. Esto va a permitir que la comunidad CJoRe pueda ofrecer Lujo a la Carta personalizado bajo demanda de forma transparente. 




Beneficios del Crowdsourcing:
Todos ganan... Gracias al crowdsourcing el cliente recibirá mejores precios y un trato cercano personalizado con una experiencia de compra única, mientras que los detallistas no necesitarán amontonar stock en sus establecimientos, aumentarán su oferta y margen de beneficio, no correrán ningún riesgo y, los Autores obtendrán reconocimiento y mayor beneficio económico por su trabajo.
El crowdsourcing, ofrece un factor de diferenciación y ventaja competitiva a todos los profesionales de la comunidad CJoRe, sumando los beneficios relacionados con el método just in time; y por otro lado, una nueva experiencia de compra y un proceso de atención al cliente colectivo, innovador, cercano, abierto y transparente.

They are talented artisans who take immense pride in their work, and it shows. Here is what folks are saying about our bags.. It’s an honor to finally share Folk with you! We are excited to spread the word and raise funds to craft our bags on a grander scale. Your support will guaranty you receive a well crafted bag at a fair price, and backed by a 100 year warranty. Thank you for joining us on this journey!Doing things for the first time can be a challenge. We've made mistakes in the past and have learned from them along the way. We have built a great relationship with our talented leather artisans who are committed to bringing Folk to life. They are highly skilled in their craft and understand that every detail is critical. Even with experience, unforeseen challenges or ""acts of god"" can slow down the process. These delays are always frustrating. To further limit any potential issues, we have completed a small test run of bags to check for any production problems and to estimate capacity before launching our campaign. It went flawlessly and we are confident that our next round will be just as smooth.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ABOUT KARN GOODE</strong></h3>
<p> I am a technical fashion designer for both men and women, proving my design abilities with outstanding scarves to start.  With our team’s creative talents, eye for detail and use of vivid colours, we design collections of scarves for all ages that put smiles on faces and warm the hearts and souls of all who wear them. We seek out innovative and intriguing fibres from the worlds’ award winners with a dedication to always achieving luxurious and superb quality. We know you will like them. We test all designs before they go to market.  My need for perfection comes from years of practice and experience of breathing in the life style of fashion. Our goal is to please our customers by giving them something truly special.</p>

<p><strong>Our desire to proceed with the introduction of our women's capsule collection 101 KARN GOODE for FW2016 came earlier than expected and was recently launched in New York City this past May.</strong> Investing all our resources, we hoped for the best.  We were thrilled by the positive response and request for multiple orders - many more than we can handle on our own and that is why we need your help. We need to go into production immediately to be on time to deliver for FW2016 orders that have already been placed and to get ready for re-orders. </p>

<p>Collaborating with award winning mills worldwide, we are extremely committed to keeping quality items alive. <strong>We strongly believe in making valuable pieces using natural fibres that feel good against the skin.</strong> We honour old traditions and combine them with modern technology without using poor labour conditions and without overproducing. The world of fashion is changing. There is a new movement and awareness. Our youth care deeply about our environment and global working conditions. They are passionate about identifying problems and finding solutions.  We value and honour these ideals by using natural fibres that are produced sustainably without the use of harmful chemicals. </p>
<p>As a contributor, you will also be promoting these same ideals and will benefit from a very special accessory that will make you feel incredible, keep you stylish, and keep our brand in demand. My goal is to be able to sustain my garment label that will launch in Fall 2016 while keeping <img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470927282/u4mzbne7a7lg80wwe2sg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> moving forward.  <strong>Our  clothing collection is sold out and we are awaiting funds for more fabric and when we achieve this goal we will take on more orders for the collection offering wonderful incentives for our contributors in thanks for your support. </strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Fabrics</h3>
<div>Our fabrics are very special and much of our budget is spent on sourcing out the most intriguing ones. When we do find them, we test them and make sure they meet our 4F standard above which is often very challenging but well worth the outcome.   Here is a close-up of one we have added into the collection to give you a better perspective on the innovative fibres we use for the scarves and the clothing. Each and every fabric we choose has wonderful attributes. Making clothing is hard work that takes on many stages to achieve the final outcome so we never compromise when it comes to our fabrics. </div>

<p>The hardest thing has been cash flow as we have had to earn a living with our business from the get go. Each season we have needed a minimum of $30,000 + just to keep moving along. Each season comes around quickly with many opportunities, most we have had to decline because of a lack of funds or a lack of time to raise the funds. We needed to start our womenswear collection late in the season because we had trouble financing it in such a hurry while maintaining our scarf collection at the same time. But even so, we managed to get to New York to present the collection and we did get orders.

 I am a technical fashion designer for both men and women, proving my design abilities with outstanding scarves to start.  With our team’s creative talents, eye for detail and use of vivid colours, we design collections of scarves for all ages that put smiles on faces and warm the hearts and souls of all who wear them. We seek out innovative and intriguing fibres from the worlds’ award winners with a dedication to always achieving luxurious and superb quality. We know you will like them. We test all designs before they go to market.  My need for perfection comes from years of practice and experience of breathing in the life style of fashion. Our goal is to please our customers by giving them something truly special.

After launching over 2 years ago, we have managed to create seasonal collections of luxe scarves that are sold on our B2B site (wholesale) and our B2C (retail) site, shipping worldwide. The  brand is carried in luxury boutiques in Canada and the U.S.

Our desire to proceed with the introduction of our women's capsule collection 101 KARN GOODE for FW2016 came earlier than expected and was recently launched in New York City this past May. Investing all our resources, we hoped for the best.  We were thrilled by the positive response and request for multiple orders - many more than we can handle on our own and that is why we need your help. We need to go into production immediately to be on time to deliver for FW2016 orders that have already been placed and to get ready for re-orders. 

Collaborating with award winning mills worldwide, we are extremely committed to keeping quality items alive. We strongly believe in making valuable pieces using natural fibres that feel good against the skin. We honour old traditions and combine them with modern technology without using poor labour conditions and without overproducing. The world of fashion is changing. There is a new movement and awareness. Our youth care deeply about our environment and global working conditions. They are passionate about identifying problems and finding solutions.  We value and honour these ideals by using natural fibres that are produced sustainably without the use of harmful chemicals. 
As a contributor, you will also be promoting these same ideals and will benefit from a very special accessory that will make you feel incredible, keep you stylish, and keep our brand in demand. My goal is to be able to sustain my garment label that will launch in Fall 2016 while keeping  moving forward.  Our  clothing collection is sold out and we are awaiting funds for more fabric and when we achieve this goal we will take on more orders for the collection offering wonderful incentives for our contributors in thanks for your support. 

Against All Odds
 


 




Funding
We need $50,000 . The money will be used for production on orders already placed. The rest we have managed on our own from the previous seasons from our scarf collections. Since we are growing and our product is selling well, we constantly need larger amounts of funding. We took on orders for our new clothing collection so we need funding to make it happen and take up on all of the opportunities we received thus far including re-orders. 
 

 
Our 4F Standard
FABRIC must be valuable
FIT for comfort
FUNCTIONAL for various occasions
FEEL fabulous

 
Fabrics
Our fabrics are very special and much of our budget is spent on sourcing out the most intriguing ones. When we do find them, we test them and make sure they meet our 4F standard above which is often very challenging but well worth the outcome.   Here is a close-up of one we have added into the collection to give you a better perspective on the innovative fibres we use for the scarves and the clothing. Each and every fabric we choose has wonderful attributes. Making clothing is hard work that takes on many stages to achieve the final outcome so we never compromise when it comes to our fabrics. 
 
 

Sheer fabric that is an intricate weave with stripes of birch white and black virgin wool. The wool keeps you warm and the sheer allows the skin to breathe and feel comfortable. 


 Perks
One of these wonderful perks, just choose one! OR If you would like to donate freely we will add your name to our list of investors that we are keeping for the future when we will offer investment percentages. You will receive letters of progress and be invited to invest larger amounts for bigger percentage earnings in the future as our company grows. Constant funding is needed to move forward and each season comes with new opportunities and financial challenges that must be met.
Check out the following list of perks which can be purchased through this campaign under PERKS. If you would like to donate larger amounts and receive a scarf as well simply donate the desired sum and write to services@karngoodescarf.com stating the perk you would like to receive and your shipping details.   
The Goode Character Icon

Just send us an image/photo of what you would like as an icon, and we will make it special for you. This icon can be used on your email or social media pages as an avatar. The better the photo, the better the outcome. You can use your cell phone, tablet or camera. It's fun! Check out how we use ours, and while you are there join the following pages for updates on my work.

Have you ever destroyed your glasses because you put it into the neckline of your t-shirt?
Probably it happened to everybody.
Some day I had the idea for the first feature and so I integrated a string in the t-shirts and hoodies where you can hook your glasses in.



FIFTEENZEROFIVE was born. A smart streetwear label which gives you more fun in urban life with its smart features.

And you don't think about it until you need one.So I integrated a hair tie holder in the caps and you will ever have your hair tie with you.



About the clothes

The clothes are all made of organic cotton. Currently the upgrading and finishing of the t-shirts, hoodies and caps is handmade. The prints are made of flock film.But with increasing amounts I will switch to screen printing.

<p></p>
<p>Today we buy 400% more clothing
than we were buying 20 years ago. This is due to fast fashion. </p>
<p>Last year North Americans purchased
20 billion fashion garments. That works out to 60 garments each for every man,
woman and child in the country. The result is that around 70lbs of clothing is
being tossed in the garbage per person every year!</p>
<p>When we had our child we learned that<b> the
childrenswear industry was one of the worst culprits. </b></p>
<p>Standard baby clothing comes in 3
month size increments. Within a baby’s first year they go through 4 sizes of
pants! This is not only inconvenient and costly for parents, but it
contributes greatly to the waste outlined above. Fast fashion clothing
uses cheap materials and manufacturing that doesn't last. The result is a continuous
loop of over consumption!</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>The Solution</b></h3>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">
</p><p><b>Stylish, sustainable, affordable.</b> We have
created <a href=""www.kooshoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KOOSHOO</a> Kids Pants to fit 3X longer than traditional kids clothing. Our daughter is 20 months old and wearing the

babies born annually in North America, a <b>design like ours could save 8

alone! </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464109455/KOOSHOO_Kids_Pants_Fit_3X_Longer_eaf1dt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<p>Crowdfunding is helping something get made in exchange for a great deal. Funds raised will allow us to go to production on the Kids Pants. Without your help, these pants cannot be made.  </p>
<p>Below we’ve put together 12 great packages. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">By purchasing a package, and sharing this campaign with friends and family that care, you'll help make fashion accountable to our next generation. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>What to do:</p>
<p><b>1) </b>Choose your package either below or on
the right hand side of the screen. At this stage you are NOT able to select
size and color. Once you've paid for your package we'll be in touch with size and color options. </p>
<p><b>2) </b>Once funded, we'll email you with a survey (mid June, 2016) to get your final size and color choices, as well as your mailing address. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460698243/KOOSHOO_Kids_Pants_pick_your_package_n6zjt8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461287109/KOOSHOO_Kids_Pants_packages__1_find_peace_xrxqhy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-best-kids-pants-in-the-world/payments/new?perk_id=3535556"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>PACKAGE #1</b> - Find Peace</a></p><ul>

The Challenge

Today we buy 400% more clothing
than we were buying 20 years ago. This is due to fast fashion. 
Last year North Americans purchased
20 billion fashion garments. That works out to 60 garments each for every man,
woman and child in the country. The result is that around 70lbs of clothing is
being tossed in the garbage per person every year!
When we had our child we learned that the
childrenswear industry was one of the worst culprits. 
Standard baby clothing comes in 3
month size increments. Within a baby’s first year they go through 4 sizes of
pants! This is not only inconvenient and costly for parents, but it
contributes greatly to the waste outlined above. Fast fashion clothing
uses cheap materials and manufacturing that doesn't last. The result is a continuous
loop of over consumption!


The Solution

Stylish, sustainable, affordable. We have
created KOOSHOO Kids Pants to fit 3X longer than traditional kids clothing. Our daughter is 20 months old and wearing the
same sized pair KOOSHOO
Kids Pants as she did when she was just 5 months old. With 4 million
babies born annually in North America, a design like ours could save 8
to 12 million garments from landfills annually - in just that size
alone! 
We've wear-tested these pants on children around the world and the love for them has been unanimous. Now we need your help. How This Works
Crowdfunding is helping something get made in exchange for a great deal. Funds raised will allow us to go to production on the Kids Pants. Without your help, these pants cannot be made.  
Below we’ve put together 12 great packages. By purchasing a package, and sharing this campaign with friends and family that care, you'll help make fashion accountable to our next generation. 

What to do:
1) Choose your package either below or on
the right hand side of the screen. At this stage you are NOT able to select
size and color. Once you've paid for your package we'll be in touch with size and color options. 
2) Once funded, we'll email you with a survey (mid June, 2016) to get your final size and color choices, as well as your mailing address. PACKAGE #1 - Find Peace
A meditation for Mothers taught by our co-founder, Rachel Evans. It's a gift that can easily be shared forward.

1. PANTS TO GROW with your child

We designed our KIds Pants so that you can literally expand the pants as your child grows. The benefits: less shopping, less waste, more comfort & more savings. Expandable Waistband: Wear folded over at first and roll up as they grow. Expandable Cuffs: Wear cuffed at first and roll down as they grow.2. Supreme COMFORT






Our kids
pants have been designed with a wide waistband to eliminate pressure points. In
other words:  tummy friendly and big belly breathing
The yoga-pant inspired fold-over waistband can be rolled for hip-hugging snugness or unrolled for more coverage and warmth. Minimal seams on the waistband means no bulk or itchiness. Flatlock stitching is used for high performance activewear because it's ultra-strong, reversible and has a seamless feel. 





3. Incredibly DYED FABRICS




4 solid neutrals that make great staples for every
wardrobe. We chose these 4 colors because they work with every outfit.
4 hand dyed Batik colors that are super cool. Batik is an ancient Indonesian art-form that
involves patterning with hot wax. We work with artists in Los
Angeles who individually hand dye each pair of pants. 
All garments are dyed using low impact reactive dyes in a solar powered
dye house. 








4. The Finest ORGANIC COTTON



We've used the softest organic cotton so no pesticides are rubbing against your child’s sensitive skin. When blended with just the right amount of spandex for stretchability, you get the most comfortable kids pant on the market. 




5. SIZES TO GROW with your child




As parents, we understand once you find a great thing, you don't
want to let it go. We've developed KOOSHOO Kids Pants with
sizes that range from 1 month to 5 years – and a unisex style that caters for cloth
diapers to undies. 









BONUS! Limited edition, hand-made, leather KIDS SHOES


To sweeten the pot, we have
collaborated with Love Jules Leather, the
best hand crafted shoe makers on the continent. The super-cute, hand made shoes are exclusive to this
campaign and in limited supply.

พระตถาคตทั้งหลาย จะบังเกิดขึ้นก็ตาม, จะไม่บังเกิดขึ้นก็ตาม, ธรรมธาตุนั้น ย่อมตั้งอยู่แล้วนั่นเทียว
สัตตานัง มายึดติดในสังขตะ ในภพภูมิต่างๆ ในสังสารวัฏ มายาวนาน จนหาที่สุดของเบื้องต้น เบื้องปลายไม่ได้
การได้กาย มนุษย์ นั้นยาก เหมือนเต่าตาบอด ว่ายอยู่ในน้ำที่ท่วมโลกทั้งใบ ร้อยปีผลุครั้งหนึ่ง จะลอดเข้าห่วงเพียงห่วงเดียวที่ลอยไปมานั้นยาก แต่ยังง่ายกว่าได้กายเป็นมนุษย์
แต่จะมี มนุษย์ จำนวนเพียงเท่ากับเศษดินปลายเล็กเท่านั้น ที่จะได้เกิดเป็นมนุษย์อีกสักครั้ง
แม้จะเกิดเป็นมนุษย์ยาก เราก็เกิดมามากจน น้ำตาของเราที่เคยหลั่งไหล มีมากกว่าน้ำในมหาสมุทรทั้งสี่
พระตถาคตทรงตรัสรู้ คำสอนสอดรับทั้งหมด เป็นจริง เป็นอกาลิโก ทรงเป็นครูของเทวดา มาร พรหม มนุษย์ ไม่มีใครสามารถคัดง้านในสิ่งที่พระตถาคตทรงสอนไว้ 
ประตูนครแห่งความไม่ตาย ตถาคตเปิดโล่งไว้แล้ว 
พระตถาคต บอก สอน มรรควิธีที่ง่ายต่อการบรรลุธรรม ให้ไว้แล้ว
สั่งสมสุตตะ พุทธวจน จนคล่องปากขึ้นใจแทงตลอดด้วยดีด้วยทิฐิ
ผู้ได้ฟัง พุทธวจน ก่อนทำกาละ เป็นอนาคามี ได้กายเป็นเทวาอกนิฏฐา สุทธาวาส และปรินิพพานในชั้นนี้
ร่างกายที่ยาววาหนึ่งนี้ ...เป็นทางให้ถึงความดับไม่มีเหลือของโลก

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Amanda Sanderson, founder of SHB Apparel, I am an Indigenous woman from Saulteaux First Nation in SK, Canada. I started SHB Apparel from the ground up a little over a year ago. SHB Apparel means Spirit of a warrior, Hope for the future and the Beauty of life. My vision and inspiration for my business evolves around my daughters own attempts and experiences with suicide. She struggled and suffered with suicide for a few years. As a mother watching her beautiful daughter suffer during her very short life and being there for her has given me the strength to help our youth, women and men. My daughter has overcome this devastating time in her life and has since blossomed into a beautiful young woman with confidence and self worth. My vision and my inspiration all started with my oldest daughter and right now it is my younger daughter who needs this support. SHB Apparel will be that voice and raise suicide awareness for those that struggle with suicide and support those families that lost a loved.</p>
<p>We just did our first photo shoot with some youth, women and men who all had their own powerful stories and gave them a chance to shine in their own way. These youth, women and men were all shy at first and by the end of the photo shoot, they were laughing and smiling, which was music to my ears. The photo shoot already made a huge impact on these youth, women and men, this is why I started SHB Apparel.</p>
<p> Whats in the future for SHB Apparel? We  will be hosting rallies, conferences and workshops. . We will be hosting a Suicide Awareness Rally in May, 2018 for our youth, women and men who are struggling to find that desire for life and for those that lost a loved one to suicide. </p>
<p>We want to make an impact for our youth, women and men who suffer and struggle with suicide and support those families that lost a loved one. We are a start up business, ready to launch and we are exploring all areas so we can be that voice and raise suicide awareness. We have a high rate of suicides and suicide attempts in Saskatchewan and all across Canada. </p>
<p>We broke down some goals: </p>
<p>SHB Apparel's dream goal is $50,000. This is what we need to get SHB Apparel launched in the summer of 2018. We have broken a list to each goal we make. </p>
<ul>
<li>$30,000           Launch SHB Apparel, Inventory, Apparel, Advertising, Marketing</li>
<li>$15,000            Product or fall/winter line, a certain % will be donated to a cause</li>
<li>$5,000              Public Speaking Engagements for Suicide Awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be one of the first to get our brand new apparel and accessories. We have amazing perks that you can get. We will be one step closer to launching so we can help our loved ones and support those families. </p>
<p>I am so excited to show this video and photos of the youth, women and men because it really means a lot to me. I want to help out everyone affected by suicide, I want them to know that they are not alone, I want them to know they are precious, loved and adored. I want to support those families who already lost a loved one to suicide because that could of been me and it hurts to lose a loved one. </p>

Amanda Sanderson
Saskatoon, SK, Canada
 
Hi, my name is Amanda Sanderson, founder of SHB Apparel, I am an Indigenous woman from Saulteaux First Nation in SK, Canada. I started SHB Apparel from the ground up a little over a year ago. SHB Apparel means Spirit of a warrior, Hope for the future and the Beauty of life. My vision and inspiration for my business evolves around my daughters own attempts and experiences with suicide. She struggled and suffered with suicide for a few years. As a mother watching her beautiful daughter suffer during her very short life and being there for her has given me the strength to help our youth, women and men. My daughter has overcome this devastating time in her life and has since blossomed into a beautiful young woman with confidence and self worth. My vision and my inspiration all started with my oldest daughter and right now it is my younger daughter who needs this support. SHB Apparel will be that voice and raise suicide awareness for those that struggle with suicide and support those families that lost a loved.
We just did our first photo shoot with some youth, women and men who all had their own powerful stories and gave them a chance to shine in their own way. These youth, women and men were all shy at first and by the end of the photo shoot, they were laughing and smiling, which was music to my ears. The photo shoot already made a huge impact on these youth, women and men, this is why I started SHB Apparel.

We want to make an impact for our youth, women and men who suffer and struggle with suicide and support those families that lost a loved one.

<p><strong>MOUNTAIN MADNESS!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551305745/mpo5pkovrdbhjadrixse.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As an avid outdoor enthusiast and former wildlife biologist, I've learned a lot about physical exertion and safety in the back country. I know how lost time in the mountains can mean the difference between a safe, fun outing or a tense, miserable experience. I've lived in the Tetons of Idaho and Wyoming, the Green Mountains of Vermont, and the Olympics of Washington state. I hike, run, bike, skate ski, telemark ski, and sea kayak. I served in the United States Marine Corps and fought wild land fires in the US Forest Service.  I've spent enough time in bad weather to know what gear works best for me.</p>
<p><strong>MERELY ANNOYING OR MADDENING?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554851623/jysrdfu8o9chqmq7fbcl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Sometimes the best way up a steep mountain is getting into a rhythm to pound out the miles in horizontal and vertical distance. Unfortunately, passing showers or snow squalls are a fact of life in high altitude recreation. Every moment spent digging through your pack to add or peel off a layer is broken rhythm and lost time and just downright annoying! Conversely, you can't wear your rain shell the whole time or you'll sweat to death.</p>
<p><strong>MY ALTERNATIVE</strong></p>
<p>After years of fine-tuning I've come up with the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak, a rain shell with the versatility of a cloak. It features a special harness that allows you to carry the cloak on your back when you don't need it, but it's within easy reach when you do. While carrying it, you'll forget it's even there. Specially designed sleeves allow you to insert your arms simply by reaching behind and pulling the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak forward one arm at a time. You can even do this without stopping. I have a utility patent pending on its innovative features.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555115368/ewszfxxq4twsyxlsh5uo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A key feature is the integrated backpack cover that allows the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak to go over a small to medium size backpack and act as a rain cover. The cloak's patent pending suspension strap doesn't interfere with backpack straps and lets you remove your backpack without undoing the cloak. The cloak is supported by the special strap so that the cloak functions independently of the backpack.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551829223/qiqwk8aseq55wfbuhzfq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>THE END PRODUCT</strong></p>
<p>The <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak is a full featured rain shell incorporating a three layer waterproof breathable fabric (Gore Tex preferred), taped seams, waterproof zippers, hip and chest pockets, an adjustable hood, and zippered chest vents. Unlike conventional raincoats or parkas, the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak is worn <i><strong>OVER </strong></i>your backpack so the cloak is not compressed by backpack shoulder straps, sternum straps, and hip belts, allowing air to flow freely underneath. Loose sleeves; wide, adjustable cuffs; and zippered chest vents guarantee that you'll stay as cool as possible when you encounter the occasional cloud burst on your uphill slog.</p>
<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/332450037"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>THE ADVANTAGES</strong></a></p>
<p>The <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak means no more getting soaked while waiting until the last minute to stop and dig your conventional raincoat out of your pack.</p>
<p>No more over-heating while guessing when it will be ""OK"" to put away your conventional raincoat.</p>
<p>No more breaking stride just to deal with retrieving your conventional raincoat. Think of the time saved by not having to stop, remove your pack, dig out your raincoat, put on your raincoat, and put your pack back on.</p>
<p>Imagine being stopped at a traffic light on your bicycle and putting on the<i> Trek About</i>™ Cloak in mere seconds.</p>
<p>As a windproof and waterproof/breathable outer layer, the <i>Trek About™</i> Cloak can be donned and doffed in the blink of an eye, letting you more precisely regulate your temperature. You can dress lightly because your cloak is only an arm's length away at all times.</p>
<p>When you carry the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak on your back, you can just <i><strong>keep dry, keep cool, and keep moving!</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555115468/nm58qeviqtcha1zg755k.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p>
<p>As an added bonus, carrying the Trek About™ Cloak on your back frees up extra space in your pack for food or photography equipment, or feel secure with just a hydration pack because the cloak is always there just in case. </p>
<p>Even in urban settings, the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak allows you to go shopping without having to carry your raincoat on your arm or in your shopping cart. You can just walk in and out of coffee shops without fear of forgetting your expensive raincoat on a chair. Running errands on a rainy day suddenly became much simpler. </p>
<strong>WHAT'S NEEDED</strong><p>An initial production run will require a minimum order of 300-500 units. Some features such as fabric and finishing details may be altered or deleted to keep the retail price below the target of $300. This could come down if funding is available for a larger production run. Some funds will be reserved for advertising. This would include additional photography and updates to the company website once product is available. If the goal is not reached, all funds will be applied towards production.</p>
<p>If you're like most people who don't have the luxury of rescheduling hikes due to unsettled weather, or if you simply like maintaining a steady pace to gain elevation and distance quickly, then contribute to the campaign or pre-order the <i>Trek About™ </i>Cloak and help usher in a new world of hiking speed and comfort.</p>
<p><strong>FUTURE DESIGNS AND APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The next development of the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak design will be a warmup jacket/hoodie that allows you to keep it on as you start your activity then shed a layer as you heat up. No more wrapping a jacket around your waist or worse, ditching a jacket along the trail to be picked up later. Your base layer conveniently hangs off your back until it's needed again.</p>
<p>By varying the fabric and features, the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak can adapt to other applications such as  hunting and fishing, security, forestry, agriculture, etc. Generally, anyone needing to keep their hands free and their rain gear handy will see the value in the <i>Trek About</i>™. Versions using lightweight, non-breathable waterproof fabrics could be more popular in hot, humid climates or as lower priced alternatives.</p>
<p>A version of the <i>Trek About</i>™ Cloak to address the needs of backpackers and thru-hikers with their large, cumbersome, and heavy backpacks is also planned.  </p>

<h3><strong>Our Ethics</strong></h3>
<p>Asime stems from two friends who have come together to create a socially responsible clothing brand, working with small businesses in Ghana and supporting the outstanding work of the Dream Big Ghana foundation. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546381219/pwqo96gut8jnmlhpukcr.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Charity</strong></h3>
<p>Since 2010, Dream Big Ghana NGO’s mission has been to support the lives of people of the communities in the Volta Region, Dzita and Dzita-Agbledomi, improving access to sanitation, health care and educationally focused opportunities.</p>
<p>One of Dream Big's key initatives is the construction of EcoSan toilets in the region - above ground units that recycle human waste, using natural processes to transform that waste into a safe, organic compost and fertilizer. This year they hit a huge milestone building their 100th compost toilet for families, schools and workplaces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546381351/ayzxm2az2dxv9cwyuwlc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the years Dream Big has developed strong links with the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Nottingham, offering placements including assisting with maternal and child health, adult medicine, surgery and dentistry. More recently health care programmes have focused on menstrual hygiene – an area that struggles to improve for females across Africa leading to poor reproductive health. Many girls miss out on school while menstruating due to stigma, a lack of sanitary supplies and inadequate toilet facilities. With this in mind, Dream Big has forged a new and exciting partnership with Days for Girls (DfG) Ghana, who are part of the global movement making sustainable, washable menstrual pads for young females.</p>
<p>In 2017 the Dream Big Community learning centre opened its doors and has since had 7000 visits to date. Holding talks and workshops for all ages including Maths, English and Science classes, ICT skills, health and hygiene education, homework support, entrepreneurship skills, arts and craft, dancing, drumming and a whole host of other cultural activities.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We are committed to working hand-in-hand with small fashion houses like Aunty’s fashion home - helping their businesses to grow by providing skills, equipment and expertise, alongside facilitating the employment of women from local villages.</p>
<p>ASIME collection/01 has been produced in Aunty’s fashion home by Aunty and Rita. ASIME has supported Aunty and Rita with new machinery, making their processes in-house smoother. Partners, Dream Big Ghana, have also created educational opportunities such as entrepreneurial workshops and IT training for Aunty and other local businesses to attend. </p>
<p>Every supplier used for this collection, including the production of this look-book, has been sourced ethically in Ghana. For instance, the printed Ankara cottons and Kente cloth, were all purchased from business women in markets of Accra, Anyanwi and Anloga. It’s been a journey developing relationships, friendships and trust with everyone we have met along the way. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Our Ethics
Asime stems from two friends who have come together to create a socially responsible clothing brand, working with small businesses in Ghana and supporting the outstanding work of the Dream Big Ghana foundation. 

 
The Charity
Since 2010, Dream Big Ghana NGO’s mission has been to support the lives of people of the communities in the Volta Region, Dzita and Dzita-Agbledomi, improving access to sanitation, health care and educationally focused opportunities.
One of Dream Big's key initatives is the construction of EcoSan toilets in the region - above ground units that recycle human waste, using natural processes to transform that waste into a safe, organic compost and fertilizer. This year they hit a huge milestone building their 100th compost toilet for families, schools and workplaces.
 

 
Over the years Dream Big has developed strong links with the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Nottingham, offering placements including assisting with maternal and child health, adult medicine, surgery and dentistry. More recently health care programmes have focused on menstrual hygiene – an area that struggles to improve for females across Africa leading to poor reproductive health. Many girls miss out on school while menstruating due to stigma, a lack of sanitary supplies and inadequate toilet facilities. With this in mind, Dream Big has forged a new and exciting partnership with Days for Girls (DfG) Ghana, who are part of the global movement making sustainable, washable menstrual pads for young females.
In 2017 the Dream Big Community learning centre opened its doors and has since had 7000 visits to date. Holding talks and workshops for all ages including Maths, English and Science classes, ICT skills, health and hygiene education, homework support, entrepreneurship skills, arts and craft, dancing, drumming and a whole host of other cultural activities.
 
Who Made Your Clothes?
AUNTY & RITA, AGBLEDOMI, GHANA

 
We are committed to working hand-in-hand with small fashion houses like Aunty’s fashion home - helping their businesses to grow by providing skills, equipment and expertise, alongside facilitating the employment of women from local villages.
ASIME collection/01 has been produced in Aunty’s fashion home by Aunty and Rita. ASIME has supported Aunty and Rita with new machinery, making their processes in-house smoother. Partners, Dream Big Ghana, have also created educational opportunities such as entrepreneurial workshops and IT training for Aunty and other local businesses to attend. 
Every supplier used for this collection, including the production of this look-book, has been sourced ethically in Ghana. For instance, the printed Ankara cottons and Kente cloth, were all purchased from business women in markets of Accra, Anyanwi and Anloga. It’s been a journey developing relationships, friendships and trust with everyone we have met along the way. 
Our aim is to continue working with many more tailors, fashion homes and workshops in the same way we have Aunty’s. Creating a co-operative of businesses who will work with ASIME as vendors, but also offer their services to other local brands and customers, expanding their businesses.

It started with a single agenda to upcycle industrial waste to create premium short collections.Since then, we have grown from a womenswear brand to excel in menswear, accessories and soft furnishing for home. With each collection, we strengthen our dedication to creating a circular fashion brand with a global reach. While we currently work extensively with pre-consumer waste, we intend to use our funds to introduce alternatives to collect, resell and recycle post-consumer waste in India.   India is one of the biggest garment and textile hubs and is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Our millennial population is around 440 million people, many of whom understand the need to live a sustainable lifestyle but have limited options available to make that switch.   Why do we work with scraps?  Understanding Wastage  1 large scale manufacturing unit in India can produce up to 1,50,000 pieces a day.On an average 16-20% of total fabric consumption is discarded in mass production as defected fabrics, end of the line fabrics, post cutting waste and post stitching waste.
This equates to around 45,000 meters of solid fabric wastage created by one unit every day.               
We work tirelessly to put this fabric back in good use and ensure all our wastage is consumed within our processes.Fabric Saved Is Fabric Made!  The funds we raise will be dedicated to buy more fabric scraps and increase our production to make our products more accessible to the consumer. A part of the funds will be assigned to developing our sales channels.All this to bring us closer to our key focus: Making sustainable fashion an everyday choice for consumers. A glimpse into our processesWith Co-founder, Kriti Tula How we do it?  Studio & People Fixing fabrics to create products is currently done in-house in our Delhi studio.We hope to extend our production to fair trade units in India as we grow.   We work with an equally motivated team of people, from craftsmen to our designers, where everyone understands our creative processes and are aligned and committed to our goal of cleaning up the fashion industry.

</h3></div>","THE AZZO SALVI VISION

(Founded 2013)


In today's retail market, one often finds himself needing to make a choice between paying a premium price for top end designer luxury goods, or shopping at a more affordable price in the lower high street retail shops ultimately compromising on quality and uniqueness

So we say, why cant you have both? A product with the best quality, a product with unique and distinctive features, all at an honest price.

At Azzo Salvi, the vision is simple.

Create the best products ever made at a price that is much more affordable.

How do we do it?

We dedicate a lot of time to our manufacturing process. This ensures that our products are ""as good (often better)""  as anything from the top brands.

However, we are able to keep our prices respectable by simply cutting the multi million pound cost of celebrity ad campaigns used by the top fashion houses.
Furthermore, we do not have the ultra expensive costs of elaborate high end stores and  prime real estate costs   (with all the maintenance & staff overhead that go with it). 
We are able to sell the same quality products as the top designers but offered at a fraction of the price.


We have a strong belief that style and fashion should be accessible to all. With this in mind, we have dedicated to launch our collection of High end, High quality fashion shoes designed with a bit of a twist, a full focus on quality and a keen attention to detail & design.

 All this while keeping the cost at a reasonable price.

 


From Conception to CreationAll our designs start on our drawing board at our offices in England. Here the sketches and the technical details are done, the materials and colour themes are matched and created.

Our Chelsea Boots

Once we have gone through the process of design creation, pattern drawings, material and colour selection, the initial samples are made to very  strict specification.
Our products are exclusively made in Europe. Our carefully selected production partners in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and Portugal make up our 4 manufacturing locations.
We work with the best local craftsmen and Artisans using the best materials and fabrics in an effort to create true works of art.








The result is a collection of beautiful crafted products with the same
quality as the best items of any top brand…, But at a fraction of the designer
premium prices.
Every
care and attention is taken in the manufacturing of all our products.
With our
Chelsea boots all made using 100% Italian calf skin leather.





We pride ourselves in the knowledge that the quality of our items,  
The beauty and flow of our designs,
And durability of our products can compete with anything in today’s
market.
We often like to put a little bit of a twist into our designs to give
it that extra uniqueness.







Quality

We have a strong focus on the quality and finish of our products. We pay attention to every material, fabric and fittings, ensuring that their is perfection in every cut and every stitch. 

Highest quality products at an affordable price. that is what we aim to achieve.
Ethics

By using Manufacturers based in the EU (mainly the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Spain), we ensure that all our products are made ethically and with respect to human working conditions. We advocate for better working conditions for everyone, and take a strong stance against child labour or inhumane working conditions sometimes used by some other manufacturers in a bid to maximise their profits. it is important to us that all the members of our production team work under very decent conditions and are paid well for their skills.
MaterialAll our leather shoes are made using the best European top grain leather. all produced treated and processed in Italy. With a strong network we are able to source these materials and then process them in-house using our European leather manufacturing partners. this ensures we have the highest quality material for all our leather shoes.
The Challenges we face
We have been able to create a dedicated customer base and sufficient interest from the public.
 We have recorded very good sales and demand for our products is on the rise. The feedback that we have received for or products have been fantastic.
But like
any other new business, we face the problem of cash flow and this affects our
production circle. Meaning we are having a lot of unfulfilled demands and
potential loss of sales.
In the 2 years that we have been in business, we have found that we often have to wait for some products to sell before we can commit the funds into developing other products
We are
hoping to raise the funds that will enable us turnover higher production units. Higher production units will also mean we can ring our prices down even further and ultimately generate higher sales.
We aim to make our mark within the industry through our unique designs, the quality of our products, and most importantly our price bracket.
With your
help, we can make this happen.




Be a part of our vision
We need your help in raising the funds to take Azzo Salvi to the next level.
In the last 2 years since the business was set up, we have spent a lot of time creating our designs, mastering our processes and building our manufacturing network. 
However, we are not able to afford the cost of a full production run which will help to bring our cost down to the level we want it to be.
We therefore need to raise the money to ease the pressure on our production runs.
At the moment , with good sales and continuously growing demand, we are unable to meet our potential high sales mark due to our inability to invest cash into larger production runs, and due to the production/turnover time scale.
 We need an  infusion of cash to balance the demand and supply of our products.
With your help, we hope to raise the funds needed to go into larger scale production.

We are also aiming to commit some of the money raised to hosting our high level fully functional eCommerce website (www.azzosalvi.co.uk).

We already have the domain name registered and just need to get the website designed to our specification and also get the products to go onto the website to steadily increase our presence in the market.
There is a plan to launching our brand officially once the website is in place.
We have collaborated with some reputable institutions in the UK to offer their students work experience and an opportunity to gain credits for their educational qualifications by doing certain projects with us.
We have specifically identified the area of publicity as the best area to work with these carefully selected partners.
We have planned a clever social media campaign that will ensure that we are noticed within the industry.
We have thought about ways to make our campaigns low budget and precise. By partnering with a handful of university undergraduates and college students who are happy to work with us on our campaigns as part of their academic credits, and also for the work experience, we strongly feel we have found the perfect format.
The arrangement suits our business model perfectly as we will be involving young people within the community by giving them the experience that will be useful to them in the future.
Furthermore, we will have access to high technology gadgets to run our campaigns as these are available at the universities and colleges that we have partnered with.
This will keep our advertising campaign and marketing to a minimal cost, it will also be beneficial to our youths who will be gaining huge experience and exposure through the project
Working with these students will also be beneficial for our long term goals as today's students are potential life long customers.
Our initial marketing campaign will be centred on a huge push on social media and how to maximise the use of the platforms that we have proposed to use 
(Mainly Facebook, Twitter and Instagram)

We intend to create video Campaigns on social media using some of our catchy phrases and slogans



Your Impact
With your contribution, we will be able to have our products ready for our official launch and to meet the demand of our ever growing customer base.
We will keep you informed as to the progress and growth of our company and you would have been a part in establishing something great and everlasting.
and hype following our social media campaign. 
The impact of your contribution will not only be beneficial for us, but as we have made contact with some college students in the media sector, we feel that this will also be beneficial to them in giving them useful experience in the working and branding campaign of a fast growing business.

Other Ways You Can Help
There are other ways that you can help us achieve our vision. By simply spreading the word of our company, our products and our campaign, you will be doing us a whole lot of good.
Please take time to inform your friends and networks about us, and share this link on your social media pages. 
Even by simply following us on instagram, Facebook or twitter you will have done something to move us in the direction we wish to go, and eventually we will reach a larger audience.

<p>The Jule‘s bag is a diaper bag for men, which combines the needs of men as business men as well as while being fathers. Coming in an elegant and practical design, it is the most comfortable diaper bag on the market with a changing mat ticker than 0,4 cm. The bag opening system has enabled us to win the 2017 Innovation Award, which is further proof of our commitment to innovation and quality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/18RrAn9dPfP99XTnA2/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It has independent compartments for all members of the family: baby, parents and older brothers or sisters. Being compact and very organized, its dimensions are adjusted to contain everything you need for everyday life and even traveling with your baby. Clever, easy and quick to convert, the back padding can be transformed into a comfortable and washable changing table.</p>

</div></div>","Hello Indiegogo community! I am Jean-François Ducros, the founder and team leader of Papa, Maman et Moi. I officially launched Papa, Maman et Moi in 2017 and have received amazing reviews for our first products. Today, I am here to introduce the smartest and most thoughtful diaper bag you have ever seen. Trust me, this backpack will change your everyday life as a parent!


medically verified products that were tested by parents
100% French expert consultancy and a product that is certified by independent labels
comfort, security and well-being of the whole family



The Jule‘s bag is a diaper bag for men, which combines the needs of men as business men as well as while being fathers. Coming in an elegant and practical design, it is the most comfortable diaper bag on the market with a changing mat ticker than 0,4 cm. The bag opening system has enabled us to win the 2017 Innovation Award, which is further proof of our commitment to innovation and quality.

It has independent compartments for all members of the family: baby, parents and older brothers or sisters. Being compact and very organized, its dimensions are adjusted to contain everything you need for everyday life and even traveling with your baby. Clever, easy and quick to convert, the back padding can be transformed into a comfortable and washable changing table.

This diaper bag is both a shoulder bag and a backpack. Wipes and the bottle pocket are directly accessible through well thought openings, even while walking and the removable trash pocket can also be used in every configuration.

Thanks to its multimedia pocket, every dad can put away his computer or tablet easily, to be connected everywhere he goes. And also aesthetically, our elegant and simple bag will finish every look – no more diaper bags with teddy bear prints, flowers and ribbons!

 DTing is world's first easy-start gesture-controlled robot and toy series. It's the most interesting and innovative toys in the world. Several already-connected toys and robots are offered on this campaign. And a developer kit is offered as well to realize anything you could dream of.We hope to give a brand-new user experience to customers of all ages. We believe users from different ages will be able to find their own kinds of fun. Hopefully, users will discover more types of creative, fun use by themselves. Our team cooperated with world-class toy and robot manufacturers, guaranteeing the products are well-made. So, a variety of already-connected toys are provided in this campaign, from trucks to drones and battling tanks. FeaturesDTing Gesture WristbandAll these gesture control experiences are realized by the help of the kernel of the robots: the “DTing Gesture Wristband”. The wristband is an all-in-one solution to detect all of your gestures, including forearm movement, hand gestures and even finger movements. The wristband detects surface electromyographic signals, gyroscopic signals, accelerometer signals and more related signals to recognize gestures with high precision. Multi-Gesture SupportTo satisfy the different habits and styles of users, the product does not limit the variety of hand gestures. In other words, the user can try hand gestures as they like. to the user can try it on and find the most comfortable or coolest gestures for them.  You can be the hero you like, such as “Magneto”, ""Star-Lord”, “Spider-Man” or whoever you like. We offer several recommended gestures to initiate your exploration, such as “thumb up”, “index finger pointing” and “gun gesture”. Both Hands PlayingGesture control is not only an absorbing interaction style but also offers traditional toys and robots an imaginary space. This may activate the user’s creativity, such as manipulating toys with both hands or establishing a gesture control battlefield. 
Force Awareness
To enhance the perceptive connection between robot and user, the force awareness is added as a function of wristband. That is to say, user could control the speed of any connected robot via changing the intensity of hand gesture. Robot will stop moving if user loses the force of hand gesture. In this case, user’s behavior will not affect on any movement of robot. Developer ToolsOur team believes that imagination is limited by developers themselves for most products. If we look into history, all the great masterpieces in interaction are user-generated. So, we have insisted on making the DTing Gesture Wristband develop-able. A developer kit is offered as well with the wireless protocol and wireless module included, enough for developers. This enables the DTing gesture control method to be capable of controlling all kinds of electronics. SYMA DroneSYMA has been an innovator and industry leader in the manufacture of high quality radio controlled Drones and Quadcopters for over 10 years. Syma has taken an innovative and visionary approach to advancing flight experience for kids.

<h1>WE NEED YOU</h1>
<p>We've done our research, completed product design, built prototypes, and successfully demonstrated those prototypes to consumers and retailers in a variety of venues. We have our supply chain in-place and firm quotes in-hand for tooling and manufacturing. The next step is clear:</p>
<h3 align=""center""><i>It's time to manufacture the Handy Hideaway</i></h3>
<p>We're committing a tremendous amount of our own personal resources to fund these next steps, but we need your help to move forward. We're not asking you to fund the entire next phase. Instead, your contribution will simply HELP cover the costs of the first production run. In essence, you can help us ""break the barrier"" that innovators face when trying to transition from prototype to production.</p>
<p>In gratitude of your contribution, we have prepared a menu of available perks.</p>
<h3 align=""center"">Thank you for your interest and your contribution!</h3>
<br/>
<hr/>
<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p>Your contributions will be used to help bring this product to market. To do so, we must first have an expert tooling shop build the plastic injection molds for each of the piece-parts of the Handy Hideaway. Then, a production facility uses those molds to produce and package the product. Afterward, we transport the packaged product to a warehousing and distribution center. Wholesale and retail orders are then fulfilled from that location.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply chain costs, contributions will also be applied to sales and advertising expenses. Examples include air time and an expert host for TV shopping channels, production and airing of TV commercials such as ""As Seen On TV"", and online promotion associated with E-commerce websites.</p>

<li><em><b>73% Agree:</b><br/><i>It's difficult to reach stored personal items while actually sitting on the toilet</i></em></li>

</ul>
</div>
<hr/>
<h3>Reasons for Storage Woes and Trash Troubles</h3>
<p>So why is it that we often we find ourselves without the personal supplies we need...when and where we actually need them? The Answer is that most of us currently stock such items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the bathroom sink or in a towel closet for instance
<br/><br/>
<i>Here, we have to get up off the toilet and venture to the storage location. How awkward and embarrassing! Plus, there's no guarantee that we will actually find the item we need...we may be ""out"".  If so, then what?</i>
</li>
<br/>
<li>Above the toilet water tank on an open shelf or in a cabinet with glass doors
<br/><br/>
<i>Here, we have different issues. First, do we really want our most private supplies on-display for whoever happens to use that restroom? And second, it would take a contortionist to reach above and behind to that shelf or cabinet while sitting on the toilet. So that means we're standing up and turning around, right? Again, not a great situation.</i>
</li>
<br/>
<li>On the lid of the toilet's water tank, or perhaps in a toilet paper caddy sitting on the floor near the toilet
<br/><br/>
<i>This so-called solution has all the same problems as the cabinet or the shelf above the toilet water tank, plus one more. It's not pleasant to think about, but open storage of results in ""contamination"" of those items by the inevitable splash and splutter of: A) simply flushing the toilet, and B) males using the toilet while standing. How GROSS!</i>

Our NEWS portal provides our readers with inspiring and educational feature articles, interviews, industry updates, new store launches, event information, contests, and much more! EFW is also a comprehensive resource to members of the eco fashion industry, offering an extensive glossary listing industry terms, an organization section, a book section, videos, and an easy-to-use search system. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p>The first website of its kind, Eco Fashion
World was founded in 2007, and has outlasted similar publications by remaining
consistent and dedicated. With continued NEWS updates, and a fast-growing
international GUIDE featuring a wide variety of talented eco fashion designers
and online shops, EFW aims to be the number one resource for sustainable style.
Our collective mission is to make<span> the world
a better place through fashion.</span></p>
<p></p><p>Behind the scenes, EFW carefully selects stores and brands to work with based on what we call “eco criteria.” Our eco criterion includes work with artisans, the use of organic materials, the use of vegan materials, fair trade practices, made-to-order, ethically-sourced, vintage, recycled, and more. </p><p>The fashion industry is known as one of the top industries in creating pollution. The fashion industry is also known for an exorbitant number of cases of exploitation of workers. These are just some of the problems we aim to put in the spotlight, in hopes of educating the masses and also continuing to gain momentum and support to incite action in every person we come in contact with through our website, articles, images, and the designers and companies we support. </p><p></p><p>The EFW team wholeheartedly believes that we can change the world through fashion. We believe in supporting slow fashion, handmade, organic materials, artisans across the globe, fair treatment of workers, and fighting to reverse the damage of the industry. We have been watching the transition and ask you to support us in growing so that we can continue to feed this positive change.

<br/></div>","Our MissionThe mission of Eco Fashion World is to promote ethical fashion brands and stores through informing consumers of their options and linking them to where they can find ethical fashion products. Our NEWS portal provides our readers with inspiring and educational feature articles, interviews, industry updates, new store launches, event information, contests, and much more! EFW is also a comprehensive resource to members of the eco fashion industry, offering an extensive glossary listing industry terms, an organization section, a book section, videos, and an easy-to-use search system. 
The first website of its kind, Eco Fashion
World was founded in 2007, and has outlasted similar publications by remaining
consistent and dedicated. With continued NEWS updates, and a fast-growing
international GUIDE featuring a wide variety of talented eco fashion designers
and online shops, EFW aims to be the number one resource for sustainable style.
Our collective mission is to make the world
a better place through fashion.
Behind the scenes, EFW carefully selects stores and brands to work with based on what we call “eco criteria.” Our eco criterion includes work with artisans, the use of organic materials, the use of vegan materials, fair trade practices, made-to-order, ethically-sourced, vintage, recycled, and more. The fashion industry is known as one of the top industries in creating pollution. The fashion industry is also known for an exorbitant number of cases of exploitation of workers. These are just some of the problems we aim to put in the spotlight, in hopes of educating the masses and also continuing to gain momentum and support to incite action in every person we come in contact with through our website, articles, images, and the designers and companies we support. The EFW team wholeheartedly believes that we can change the world through fashion. We believe in supporting slow fashion, handmade, organic materials, artisans across the globe, fair treatment of workers, and fighting to reverse the damage of the industry. We have been watching the transition and ask you to support us in growing so that we can continue to feed this positive change. Let's continue to build this eco*ethical*sustainable fashion community - together! Where You Come InThe goal of the campaign is to raise funds so we can be more timely, go more in depth on the most compelling topics and have the ability to more easily interact with our readers. To accomplish this goal, we need to build a more advanced website and enhance our directory to further foster the success of our members who pay a monthly membership fee, and enable us to deliver free news to everyone. We also want to introduce discussion forums, re-launch our newsletter, offer a mobile-friendly version of EFW, and expand our promotional offerings.  Our current website is so old that updates for it no longer exist and tasks take 10 times longer than they should. EFW is run by a very small but extremely dedicated and passionate team, including the Editor-in-Chief, contributing writers, and a few interns and volunteers. EFW is also run on very limited resources. A new website is absolutely crucial for the future of EFW. What We Need We're asking for $20,000 so that we can build and launch our NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART WEBSITE, ONLINE 'GUIDE' DIRECTORY and NEWSLETTER! The funds will cover extensive web design, graphic design costs, and the costs related to our campaign perks. Changes you will see upon re-launch include:•	More Timely: increase in the number of posts per week – industry news, product reviews, events, feature articles, interviews, and more, covering all aspects of the ethical fashion industry•	Hot Topics: additional dedicated content areas to spotlight the most recent and/or most talked about news in ethical fashion•	More Interactivity: additional and improved commenting features and moderated forums on both the reader/community level and the paid subscriber level•	Enhanced GUIDE/directory features: integrated software to make it easier for subscribers to edit their directory page and other features to make it even easier for visitors to the site to search for ethical fashion products and/or information they are looking forIf we exceed our goal, fantastic!

<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>As a well-known company, we have a good handle on the risks associated with the project. Still, creating a Hagic smart watch is an extremely complex process. Each specimen in it has its own unique challenges and the scale of the project may also lead to unexpected delays. We've taken every step possible to mitigate potential issues. As with our last two projects, we plan to provide detailed and timely project updates to keep backers advised, informed, educated, and at times entertained.</p>
</div></div>","About this project

 
A 340 mAh battery makes the best battery life which lasts up to 2 days. With low-power consumption, the Hagic loop will last up to 15 days. Normally, a typical smart watch usually is left behind after running out of power. With the Hagic loop it keeps telling time. There is also a reminder for you to charge you smart watch, every time you lift your wrist. Customize your watchbands

<p>Valkyrie Apparel is run by Jennifer Iannaconi and Laurel Newman in Western Massachusetts. Our webstore opened in 2014 and we've been growing steadily ever since. In that time we have discovered that there was a gap in the market for the goth with a career and we extended our size range to cover regular AND plus sizes. However to stay true to our original mission we only offers clothing that comes in BOTH. It's not fair to anyone, no matter the size, to fall in love with a top only to find it doesn't come in your size.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2016 we discovered that we've exhausted our options for size inclusive vendors and it was time to get into the manufacturing side of fashion.</p>
<h3>The Journey So Far:</h3>
<p>There may be a number of things we haven't considered yet, but we are confident that we're prepared to meet these challenges. The Wicked Workwear product line has been in development for almost a year and we waited until NOW to start crowdfunding.</p>
<p>You see, there is a variety of apparel out there that is just, BLAH. This stuff is well made but it has no character, not even a licensed one.</p>
<p>We've been experimenting with taking those items and making them better. Last summer, we bought and tested a heat press and some transfer medium AND we've made some garments and they have survived the wash test. (Even the one that was washed on the wrong setting survived!)</p>

<p><strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Our approach of making products on demand will save us money AND help prevent landfill waste. Making more items than we actually need is a risk.

<li>Our ultimate goal is to purchase a garment printer. These will let us print our designs on anything we want and on any part of the garment we want.

<li>We'd also like a bigger heat press  and more transfer mediums. Heat press vinyl comes in an amazing selection of colors including metallic and glow in the dark.</li>
<li>Our seamstresses will need to build some clothing for us to have in stock at the start, so we'll want to pay them their time and materials.</li>
<li>And anything left over will go towards covering the background costs of maintaining an online store. (Web hosting, site security...etc.)</li>

Studying at The Glasgow School of Art, he then went on to gain a 1st class MA in Fashion from the prestigious Central St Martins fashion school in London. With recognition for his creative vision, Jamie has been nominated for numerous awards and accolades for his unprecedented creativity and fearlessness with modern texture, colour and style. After spotting an opportunity to do something different in a saturated market, Jamie decided to make the bold switch into childrenswear. Using his creative background, a lot of spirit and perseverance, Jamie set about bringing his brand to life. And so Shapes of Things was formed. A gender-neutral childrenswear clothing line with a mission to push the boundaries of innovation in textiles to set them apart from the rest.Today, Shapes of Things is a growing global brand where our values are as important as our designs. The brand is now stocked in more than 35 stores and 11 countries worldwide below are some of our current stockists.SHAPES OF THINGS TO COMEAfter an overwhelming response to our newest collection whilst exhibiting at Playtime New York, we have firmly managed to make our mark in the childrenswear market.
