Brands, an Atlanta-based small<br/>business that creates truly delicious food brands including Jake's Ice Creams.<br/>We share our headquarters, The Irwin Street Market, as an “incubator” for<br/>other local companies... individuals looking to get their foot in the door, build<br/>their brand, and make worthwhile additions to our community. In case this is<br/>your first time hearing about us, Jake's Ice Cream and Sorbets is a super<br/>premium, totally gourmet ice cream concept that has been a local favorite<br/>since we opened in 1999. We've been ranked in the top ice cream parlors<br/>in the country by MSN.com, Mother Earth News and have been featured on<br/>CNN, the Wall Street Journal and in Southern Living to name a few.<br/><br/>Based on continued requests, we've spent the last five years working to<br/>perfect a non-dairy alternative to our ice cream – something that has the great<br/>taste, quality, and texture that is expected from Jake's, but can be enjoyed<br/>by folks who are lactose-intolerant, vegan, diabetic, paleo... anyone and<br/>everyone who doesn't eat dairy for one reason or another.<br/><br/>After four years of back and forth in the kitchen, we've had our EUREKA! and<br/>found the perfect combination of ingredients: an almond milk, coconut cream,<br/>avocado and plantain base – a magical concoction we call Joyscream!<br/><br/>There's nothing but happy and healthy here...almonds and avocado being<br/>superfoods, coconut containing healthy fats and our inclusions being super<br/>delicious and nutritious. This means that Joyscream is more than just a yummy, non-<br/>dairy treat, it's actually good for you, with healthy fats, healthy<br/>sugars and antioxidants.<br/><br/>Have you ever heard of a decadent desert that was good for you? For that<br/>matter, have you ever heard of a non-dairy product that actually tasted like<br/>ice cream? Our thought is, with so many people out there who for health or<br/>ethical reasons cannot eat dairy – some of whom have never even had a<br/>scoop of ice cream before – how can we keep this to ourselves?<br/><br/>So what will it take bring our concept to the masses, get our product on<br/>the grocer's shelves, and make Joyscream a household name? We have<br/>to build an entirely new, separate kitchen exclusively for the preparation of<br/>Joyscream.<br/><br/>The cost of doing a build out for a kitchen that can accommodate us will<br/>be approximately $50,000. This includes taking an unfinished space in our<br/>building and bringing it up to USDA standards. This is a floor-to-ceiling<br/>endeavor – adding equipment including refrigeration, freezers, batch freezers,<br/>sinks, tables and shelving. We'll also be stocking the shelves with the<br/>necessary ingredients to begin producing Joyscream on a large scale. In the<br/>near term, this will get us up and running at a well-known natural grocery chain in Atlanta and empower us to do home delivery and custom, shipped<br/>orders throughout the country. Longer term, we'll be poised and ready to get<br/>Joyscream from Kenosha Falls, Wisconsin to Saskatcheuan, from Lakeland,<br/>Florida to Bakersfield, California and...well you get the drift.<br/><br/>We know that for most this may sound like a lot of money, but in the grand scheme of things commercial kitchens typically cost significantly more. We're starting this<br/>venture with a bare bones approach so that we can get Joyscream into the<br/>marketplace sooner than later, and we'll be reinvesting our sales once we're in<br/>production so that we can add to our infrastructure as we go.<br/><br/>Almost everyone has a friend or a family member that would love to enjoy a<br/>chocolate sundae, a root beer float, or a double waffle cone of strawberry and<br/>vanilla, but can't.

<p>My name is Lisette Lopez, and I’m the broad!</p>
<p>I was born an adventurer and was lucky enough to be raised in the concrete jungle itself, New York. For the last few years I have been able to really explore and indulge in my passion, art. I graduated from Pratt Institute and now I must indulge in my next adventure. Sadly, I feel New York has given me all it can and it is time for me, for the first time in my life, to set foot on foreign land. Explore territory I have not open my eyes to and soak in what I can from the rest of this world while giving back to underprivileged communities similar to mine. I grew up in Spanish Harlem and I know what it feels like to think your community has been forgotten by the outside world. After endless hours of research, I found an amazing volunteer-abroad program to turn my dreams of traveling into a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Rustic Pathways </strong></p>
<p><em>“Rustic Pathways is a pioneer in providing superior quality travel and service programs for students and families in some of the world’s most welcoming countries. Rustic Pathways demands professionalism and integrity across all of its operations, insists on quality in all aspects of its programs, and places the safety of its students above all other considerations. We enrich the lives of our students and our staff, benefit the parts of the world we serve, and build cultural bridges that lead to greater global understanding and cooperation.</em>”<em> –</em> Rustic Pathways</p>
<p>The program I am applying to is the Gap Year program in Turrialba, Costa Rica. I’ll have the opportunity to take part in a variety of projects around town and work in local schools to help students improve their English language skills.</p>

<p>Sadly, I don’t have the funds to be part of Rustic Pathways, but I am an amazing baker. With the help of your donations, I’m hoping to earn my desired amount of $3,500 and fill your bellies with cupcakes of happiness. I’m also selling pins and my Costa Rica inspired watercolor postcards.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Launched in 2018, Dirty Bird chicken specializes in chicken and waffles but also offers other soul food staples. The name ""Dirty Birds"" comes from our delicious signature dry rub used for the chicken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hi, my name is Shauntel Green. I am the owner of Dirty Birds Chicken, a soon-to-be restaurant and to-go shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</strong> One year ago, I decided to go in business with a few cousins to pursue our passion for cooking. We planned to offer Pittsburgh a twist on Chicken and Waffles that the city hasn’t seen. The business started out with three partners, including myself, and we began selling food out of the kitchen in my town home. Before we knew it the people of the community became our biggest supporters, lining up outside of my door waiting for the day's special. I quickly outgrew my little home kitchen and the two other partners dropped off to purse their own endeavors. Having such a following in the community I continued to offer menu items every Tuesday night at a local bar and kitchen. This created the opportunity to pursue Dirty Birds as a full time career to help support my family. Though the local bar was convenient and would accommodate the rush in customers one night a week would not be enough. Additionally, we’d miss the brunch customers we’d get on the weekend. With a larger client base there is a sense of urgency to open a permanent establishment for Dirty Birds.</p>
<p><strong>I am opening my very own restaurant! </strong>Sometimes I can't believe it. Nothing brings me more joy than cooking for people and very soon I will be able to do just that. With your contributions to this campaign I will be able to secure a location and purchase the last key pieces of equipment that I need in order to start feeding my customers. In supporting Dirty Birds you will also be supporting the community around us. When designing our restaurant the most important aspect for us was creating an experience and product everyone in the community can enjoy. Our hope is that at Dirty Birds our neighbors will find a vibrant, comfortable and most importantly delicious space that they can visit often.</p>
<p>So... You might be asking yourselves, what it is that we need from you? Well, we need your financial contributions and in exchange we are offering you perks that will fill both your bellies and hearts with joy!</p>
<p><strong>We aim to raise $25,000.</strong> This money will go towards securing a space and purchasing big and expensive pieces of equipment. </p>
<p>- Secure lease</p>
<p>- A 20-quart Hobart mixer<br/>- A point of sales system<br/>- A ton of little pieces of equipment (ladles, spoons, plates, pans, sheet trays and much more)<br/>- It will also help purchase some of our opening inventory</p>

Sie wird in Indien schon seit mindestens 3000 Jahren verwendet, um <strong>Stress zu reduzieren</strong>, die Konzentration zu erhöhen und die Vitalität und Leistungsfähigkeit des Körpers ganzheitlich zu unterstützen. Mittlerweile belegen zahlreiche wissenschaftliche Studien die Wirkungen der Ashwagandawurzel auf Körper und Psyche. Ashwagandha gilt als wirksames Adaptogen, das den Körper an Stress anpasst, weil es z.B. das Stresshormon Cortisol senkt. Es wird bei Depression und Angststörungen eingesetzt und auch, um das <strong>Immunsystem zu stärken.</strong> Ashwagandha ist ein „Radikalfänger“, der antioxidativ wirkt, aber auch<strong> aphrodisierend </strong>bei Mann und Frau und soll die <strong>Potenz und Fruchtbarkeit erhöhen</strong>. Er aktiviert das „<strong>Jungbrunnen“-Enzym Telomerase </strong>und sorgt auch für <strong>guten Schlaf</strong>. Als Zutat für einen Fastentee eignet sich Ashwagandhawurzel weil sie den <strong>Blutzucker reguliert</strong> und durch die psychisch ausgleichenden Eigenschaften suchthaften Essimpulsen vorbeugt. Dass sie nebenbei als „Jungbrunnen“ für den Körper wirkt lassen wir uns gerne gefallen.</p><p><strong>Weiterführende Infos </strong>unter: <a href=""https://www.ashwagandha.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ashwagandha.eu</a></p><p><strong>Quellen:</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.ashwagandha.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ashwagandha.eu</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-proven-ashwagandha-benefits#3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-proven-...</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.ashwagandha-infos.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ashwagandha-infos.de</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.mikronaehrstoffcoach.com/de/at/mikronaehrstoffe/micronutrient.ashwagandha.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.mikronaehrstoffcoach.com/de/at/mikr...</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.ayush.com/anti-aging-potential-of-ashwagandha"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ayush.com/anti-aging-potential-of-a...</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301295944_Withania_somnifera_Root_Extract_Enhances_Telomerase_Activity_in_the_Human_HeLa_Cell_Line"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301295...</a></p><p> </p><h3><strong>SÜSSHOLZWURZEL:</strong></h3><p><strong>Wirkt antientzündlich, krampflösend und sorgt für gesunde Süße.</strong></p><p>Die Süssholzwurzel wird schon seit der Antike als Heilpflanze geschätzt und ist vor allem in der chinesischen Medizin beliebt, weil sie die <strong>Wirkkraft anderer Pflanzenstoffe noch verstärk</strong>t.

Klassischerweise wird die Süssholzwurzel wegen ihrer <strong>entzündungshemmenden und krampflösenden </strong>Eigenschaften bei Atemwegsbeschwerden und Beschwerden im Magen-Darm-Bereich eingesetzt. Und nicht zuletzt wird sie als Teedroge gerne zur Geschmacksverbesserung mit positiven Nebenwirkungen eingesetzt. </p><p><strong>Quellen:</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.heilkraeuter.de/lexikon/suessholz.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.heilkraeuter.de/lexikon/suessholz.htm</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.deutsche-apotheker-zeitung.de/daz-az/2016/daz-47-2016/suessholzwurzel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.deutsche-apotheker-zeitung.de/daz-a...</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.gesundheitsforschung-bmbf.de/de/mit-sussholz-gegen-diabetes-naturstoff-senkt-den-blutzucker-3302.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gesundheitsforschung-bmbf.de/de/mit...</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238715815_Die_Sussholzwurzel_Eine_traditionsreiche_Heilpflanze_im_Blickfeld_der_modernen_Medizin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238715...</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.meine-gesundheit.de/medizin/heilpflanzen/suessholzwurzel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.meine-gesundheit.de/medizin/heilpfl...</a></p><p> </p><h3><strong>HIBISKUS:</strong></h3><p><strong>Gibt einen wunderbar säuerlichen Geschmack, enthält viel natürliches Vitamin C und gilt ebenfalls als entzündungshemmend und als natürlicher Cholesterinsenker.</strong></p><p>Mit einer Mischung aus zahlreichen Fruchtsäuren und ein hohen Vitamin C Anteil geben die Hibiskusblüten einen wunderbar sauer-herben Geschmack, der die weniger ansprechenden Aromen von Ashwagandha und Grünem Kaffee wunderbar harmonisiert.

More than 1.5 million people have fled the country making it the third largest refugee crisis in the world after Syria and Afghanistan.

<strong>YOUR PURCHASE MATTERS.</strong> Good Spread has remained briefed on the situation and through your purchases, we were able to get enough RUTF into Northern Uganda over the last 10 months to fully treat about 500 children (50,000 packets).

But because of you, we've already been able to fully treat over 1,500 children with severe acute malnutrition in the past four years - now let's make our voice heard and fully treat 1,000 more in Northern Uganda by the end of March. Contribute and/or share this campaign now and help us Spread the Love!
 Risks & Challenges
We look like idiots. That’s a risk we take daily so we’re over it.
No matter what, we will continue to provide packets of therapeutic food to children around the world for every jar sold. That’s why Good Spread exists but with the current situation, our process won’t be fast enough to catch the many children who are in need right now. This is our greatest challenge with South Sudan. It’s a race against the clock.
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute financially, you can still make a big difference and here's how:

Here’s your last chance to get in on special discounted pricing.</p><p><strong>Again, a special thank you to our more than 1,100 backers. We can’t wait to get Halo in your hands. </strong></p><p>Winemakers labor to deliver their special taste and aromatic experience the moment the bottle is opened. But the way we drink wine is inevitably based on the fact that, within hours of opening, that experience begins to change as the wine is exposed to oxygen in the air and bottle. In only a day or two, that delicate taste is spoiled.</p><p>In fact, 93% of wine drinkers report that they occasionally or often have to waste wine.</p><p>Does this sound like you?</p><ul>
<li>You only keep one bottle of wine open at a time so that it doesn't spoil</li>
<li>You would like a glass every night but that results in poor tasting wine half the time</li>
<li>You aim to finish the bottle, or don't open the next one, because you don't want to waste wine</li>
<li>You and your spouse or partner like different wines but have to choose only one bottle because you can't get through the bottles before the wine loses its pristine taste</li>
</ul><h3>How would you drink wine if wine didn't spoil?</h3><p>Unlike the way we drink wine today, you would probably have several bottles open—your favorite wine with a fish dinner, a different one to pair with steak, and even another different one for your weekend afternoons—for example. You might drink a glass every night, or you might keep a dessert wine or port open for weeks or even months.</p><p>You would open and reclose the bottle, pouring a glass at a time. When a bottle was finished, you would open a new one and drink just what you want, when you want it, anywhere you wanted to have a glass. You would never be reluctant to open a great bottle just because you only wanted a glass.</p><h3>The Perfect Glass of Wine - Anywhere, Anytime</h3><p>ZOS Halo is the first truly effective wine preserver that enables you to stop the clock and enjoy the taste the winemaker intended by preserving your wine for up to two months after opening.</p><p>Our revolutionary wine preserver eliminates 100% of the oxygen that changes the taste and eventually spoils your wine. Within minutes of inserting the Halo wine preserver, all oxygen is removed from the bottle after each pour, perfectly preserving the wine as if the bottle had never been opened. For the first time, you can drink wine by the glass and preserve the wine until you have a reason to drink the rest. And because Halo is a wine-stopper, it is completely portable and may be used anywhere without any bulky equipment.</p><p>Rick Tigner, President and CEO of Jackson Family Wines, makers of the famous Kendall Jackson brand is excited about the way this will change how we all drink wine, saying:</p><p>“I put Halo through two separate preservation tests with our La Crema Pinot Noir. After one week, two weeks, and even as we drank the last from the same bottle after 18 days, the wine was fresh, almost as if it had not been opened.”</p><h3>Rethinking the Wine You Drink and How You Drink It</h3><p>No longer will you hesitate to open your favorite wines to enjoy at your leisure over weeks or even months. No longer do your choices need to consider where and when you might want to consume wine. You're free to have multiple bottles open so you can drink a glass of white, red, and dessert wine in one evening and not be concerned that you will be throwing wine away the next day. Even sensitive wines such as organics can be perfectly preserved for enjoyment anytime. With ZOS Halo, you can truly rethink the wines you buy and how you drink them.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493248526/nazsmb7zidi3ilpm4fhd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493248508/nsavy5swmhwxuwokm2er.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>How Long Will Wine Last with ZOS Halo?</h3><p>For up to two months per bottle, ZOS wine preservers ensure that your wine tastes perfect every time. Powered by the Zero Oxygen Solutions (ZOS) cartridge system, our patent-pending, non-toxic cartridge absorbs all of the oxygen in the bottle. Open your favorite wine, pour a glass, and use ZOS Halo to preserve the wine between pours. Even if you open the bottle, pour a glass and reseal it with ZOS Halo four or five times, the wine will stay fresh. Each cartridge will preserve approximately 15 bottles of wine and, when the lighted Halo indicator turns red, indicating it is no longer effective, simply replace the inexpensive cartridge.

And because Halo is a wine-stopper, it is completely portable and may be used anywhere without any bulky equipment.Rick Tigner, President and CEO of Jackson Family Wines, makers of the famous Kendall Jackson brand is excited about the way this will change how we all drink wine, saying:“I put Halo through two separate preservation tests with our La Crema Pinot Noir. After one week, two weeks, and even as we drank the last from the same bottle after 18 days, the wine was fresh, almost as if it had not been opened.”Rethinking the Wine You Drink and How You Drink ItNo longer will you hesitate to open your favorite wines to enjoy at your leisure over weeks or even months. No longer do your choices need to consider where and when you might want to consume wine. You're free to have multiple bottles open so you can drink a glass of white, red, and dessert wine in one evening and not be concerned that you will be throwing wine away the next day. Even sensitive wines such as organics can be perfectly preserved for enjoyment anytime. With ZOS Halo, you can truly rethink the wines you buy and how you drink them.How Long Will Wine Last with ZOS Halo?For up to two months per bottle, ZOS wine preservers ensure that your wine tastes perfect every time. Powered by the Zero Oxygen Solutions (ZOS) cartridge system, our patent-pending, non-toxic cartridge absorbs all of the oxygen in the bottle. Open your favorite wine, pour a glass, and use ZOS Halo to preserve the wine between pours. Even if you open the bottle, pour a glass and reseal it with ZOS Halo four or five times, the wine will stay fresh. Each cartridge will preserve approximately 15 bottles of wine and, when the lighted Halo indicator turns red, indicating it is no longer effective, simply replace the inexpensive cartridge. There has never been a wine preserver that works as effectively as Halo!How ZOS Halo WorksUnique ZOS Halo FeaturesOur patent-pending ZOS wine preservers provide the most effective oxygen eliminating technology to preserve your wine. Only ZOS Halo has all these unique features.The ZOS cartridge design is at the foundation of the ZOS solution. The cartridge allows oxygen to permeate quickly into the interior of the cartridge where the oxygen absorption takes place. This patented, non-toxic cartridge absorbs all of the oxygen in the bottle after every pour.ZOS products are the only wine preservers that eliminate oxygen completely using a new technology developed especially for wine. ZOS Halo lights up to indicate that your wine is being preserved. You can leave it for a few days, weeks or even months! Move the bottle and the cap will light up blue, visually reminding you that your wine has been preserved correctly.When Should You Use ZOS Halo?
When you only want to have a glass or two of wine but can’t finish the whole bottle.
When you have finished a bottle of wine and would like just one more glass. 
When you want to compare two different wines to see which pairs best with your meal. 
When you want to buy that expensive bottle of wine, knowing it can be saved for up to two months risk free.
For bar and restaurant owners and wine enthusiasts, ZOS Halo saves you money! Get more pours than from the unsealed bottle, and expand wine-by-the-glass programs. 
When You're Not Using Halo While we expect that your wine consumption behavior will change by using Halo, on those rare occasions when it is not in use, the Halo Countertop Holder beautifully displays your Halo for all to see. Crafted with the same high quality bronze finish as Halo, our Countertop Holder has a timeless design and complements any home, tasting room, wine bar or restaurant. The Halo Countertop Holder will proudly display your Halo and is a beautiful accessory for every Halo.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<li>Enter your payment info and click ""Submit""!</li>
<li><i>Share our project like it's the plague. Spread it to anyone and everyone you know! </i></li>
</ul><h3>What else makes us special?</h3><ul>
<li>We are local, and produce our vodka completely from scratch right here in San Diego. Some other local distilleries actually do not distill from scratch, but rather buy already distilled NGS (Neutral Grain Spirits), and then re-distill them once in order to claim that their product was distilled in San Diego.</li>
<li>We infuse with only fresh, locally sourced ingredients for our infusions. No fake colors, flavorings, additives, or preservatives.</li>
<li>Accordingly, we are able to constantly introduce new, interesting, and unique infusions, as well as seasonal products, etc.</li>
<li>We will be the first “urban” craft distillery and tasting room with a full bar, which means we'll be able to serve up spirits made by all of the other craft distilleries in the county.</li>
<li>We spent the better part of a year working with the our Federal Overlords in order to submit very specific formulas that cover literally thousands of possible infusion recipes. As far as we know, we are the only distillery in the country to do this. What this means is that we can get new and seasonal infusion ideas from concept to bottle in 4-6 weeks, instead of the usual 4-6 months that it would otherwise take.</li>
</ul><h3>Will my investment really make a difference?</h3><p>Your investment will help more than words can convey. Specifically, you will have the chance to be part of creating a next generation urban distillery.

We've come a long way on our own, but now we need you to help make this new place rock!<br/><br/>And when you’re 85 years old sitting in a rocker on your porch (does anyone sit on their porch anymore?) sipping on your favorite 619 Vodka infusion, you’ll have something to be proud of, besides the awesomeness of just being 85 and still drinking!</p><p>And soon, you'll be lounging on our patio, soaking in the sunshine, enjoying a Scorpion Pepper Vodka Bloody Mary, just feet from where that vodka was made! </p><h3>How are we going to spend the money?</h3><ul>

<p>Coffee is truly a unique beverage.  It gets people moving in the morning and keeps them going in the early afternoon.  For some, it relaxes them after a meal...  For others, it is an essential part of that meal. It can be an exquisite artisanal experience, or a fast ""cup'a'jo"" before the daily grind.   Coffee brings people together and allows them to take a few minutes to unwind and converse at the work place.  It is the 2nd most traded commodity in the world! </p>
<p>At The Roast Truck, we want to deliver that individual experience to everyone.  We want that tasty beverage to give you exactly what you are in need of. </p>
<p>For the past 5 years, I have been brewing coffee and doing taste testings for offices all throughout Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Inland Empire.  One thing that I immediately learned in these office brewings is that people truly care about and get excited about coffee!  Business owners and employees would take a break in their busy day to come to the break room, enjoy some specialty coffee and forget about work for just a few minutes.  The wonderful conversations I would have  about the coffee industry and about life in general, sparked a passion that I want to continue to build on. </p>
<p>After partnering with local roaster Caffe Luxxe,  we have only the BEST COFFEE rated 91 or higher by Coffee Review!</p>
<p>By backing The Roast Truck, you will help bring that same feeling of relaxation and satisfaction to the community - You will fuel collegiate professionals, office environments, public events, private events and neighborhoods.   </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Coffee is truly a unique beverage.  It gets people moving in the morning and keeps them going in the early afternoon.  For some, it relaxes them after a meal...  For others, it is an essential part of that meal. It can be an exquisite artisanal experience, or a fast ""cup'a'jo"" before the daily grind.   Coffee brings people together and allows them to take a few minutes to unwind and converse at the work place.  It is the 2nd most traded commodity in the world! 
At The Roast Truck, we want to deliver that individual experience to everyone.  We want that tasty beverage to give you exactly what you are in need of. 
For the past 5 years, I have been brewing coffee and doing taste testings for offices all throughout Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Inland Empire.  One thing that I immediately learned in these office brewings is that people truly care about and get excited about coffee!  Business owners and employees would take a break in their busy day to come to the break room, enjoy some specialty coffee and forget about work for just a few minutes.  The wonderful conversations I would have  about the coffee industry and about life in general, sparked a passion that I want to continue to build on. 
After partnering with local roaster Caffe Luxxe,  we have only the BEST COFFEE rated 91 or higher by Coffee Review!
By backing The Roast Truck, you will help bring that same feeling of relaxation and satisfaction to the community - You will fuel collegiate professionals, office environments, public events, private events and neighborhoods.

<div>We recently raised money for our first industrial ice cream machine, but now we are moving into a commercial kitchen and need a big blast freezer and ice cream carts and coolers for events. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>A BLAST FREEZER</strong> - $7,000</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The blast freezer helps us get our ice cream super duper cold when we're making it so that it has less ice crystals.  It also gives us a place to store ice cream at a cold enough temperature to keep it from freezing and defrosting (which is what happens in a regular freezer).  We learned how to do all of this at Ice Cream Science School at Penn State.  Yes, Ice Cream Science School is a real thing. </div>

<div>
<strong>ICE CREAM CARTS AND COOLERS</strong> - $5,000</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We want to bring our ice cream to events and farmer's markets this summer but that means we need carts and coolers to keep them frozen at the events.  It's kinda crazy how expensive these things are, but they have cool plates that will keep them cold for 12 hours without access to power. </div>

As an added bonus, everything we make is gluten-free including our toppings, waffle cones, cookies and ice cream cone shaped dog biscuits (inspired by the real life Luca and Bosco). We don’t want our canine friends to be left out of the ice cream fun.
Catherine is the mom of Luca, a 3 year old, 5 pound, white Maltese. Ruthie is the mom of Bosco, an 8 year old, 90 pound, chocolate Lab.  They are the inspiration for the name. 


 
 
We recently raised money for our first industrial ice cream machine, but now we are moving into a commercial kitchen and need a big blast freezer and ice cream carts and coolers for events. 
 

A BLAST FREEZER - $7,000
 
The blast freezer helps us get our ice cream super duper cold when we're making it so that it has less ice crystals.  It also gives us a place to store ice cream at a cold enough temperature to keep it from freezing and defrosting (which is what happens in a regular freezer).  We learned how to do all of this at Ice Cream Science School at Penn State.  Yes, Ice Cream Science School is a real thing. 
 

ICE CREAM CARTS AND COOLERS - $5,000
 
We want to bring our ice cream to events and farmer's markets this summer but that means we need carts and coolers to keep them frozen at the events.  It's kinda crazy how expensive these things are, but they have cool plates that will keep them cold for 12 hours without access to power. 
 
REWARDS
 
We will reward you with our undying gratitude AND ice cream and cookies and toppings and even ice cream cone shaped dog biscuits. 
 
Please help us spread the word and bring more amazing ice cream love to the world. Like us on Facebook or follow us on Pinterest.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The FLASK comes with different filter options to help you brew the cup you like best. Our Coarse Metal Filter yields a slightly cleaner version of a French Press without the grit, while the Fine Metal Filter is a well balanced and full bodied cup.

We had everything ready to go: our music, tacos, and tequila for mango margaritas. But we forgot something very essential - the mangoes! We also didn't have any of the fancy cocktail making equipment like shakers, strainers, and blenders to make cocktails. We couldn't drive to the store either because we had already been drinking. That's when Craftmix was born! Since then, we've both realized how many other times we could have used Craftmix: on the plane, at parties, at concerts, hiking/backpacking, picnics, etc.! We decided to do something about this and have worked tirelessly to create Craftmix.</p><p>We've spent the last year developing and perfecting our flavors (AKA getting drunk every night while taste testing) and creating our supply chain so we're ready for production. We've taken the project as far as we can without real funding. We've made all of our samples ourselves in our own home kitchens up until this point. Now that we have everything in place, we want to be able to reformulate, mass produce with manufacturers, and distribute to your local liquor stores, grocery stores and eventually move into retail chains across the nation. Craftmix is working on some purchase orders, but unfortunately we don't have the capital needed to produce with our manufacturers' minimum order quantities and manufacture a full production run to move forward with our distribution plan. That's why we're here to raise enough money to fund our production.

We got drunk every night for 6 months attempting to create delicious blends. As soon as we thought we had a good flavor, we'd revisit it the next day, and realize that we were just drunk and it wasn't good.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Mommas’ Microgreens is a locally sourced microgreen growing start-up, founded by Peter Stalter and Shaqui Scott. They have been working together on a number of small entrepreneurial projects since 2016. </p>
<p>Shaqui has an MBA with a focus in management. He has worked as a manager in non-profit settings for several years, has had several successful solo ventures, and has worked with restaurants and bars in Pittsburgh and Greensburg to promote social events.</p>
<p>Peter has a BA in Environmental Studies with focuses in aquaponics and energy. He worked for two years in Mexico facilitating environmental education programs, teaching about composting and organic garden management.</p>
<h3>Vision of Mommas' Microgreens</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Mommas’ Microgreens seeks to provide individuals, restaurants and communities with organic, healthy and sustainable foods grown in the Greater Pittsburgh area. Microgreens are vegetable crops harvested in only 1-3 weeks, allowing us to produce quality food in shorter periods of time. They can include anything from spinach and arugula to pea shoots and radishes. The crops are more nutritionally packed and have lower water and carbon footprints than mature plants. Traditionally grown plants use pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers and are shipped dozens, if not hundreds, of miles to arrive at the supermarket. Mommas’ Microgreens cuts out the middleperson and ships it right to you.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Microgreens have not yet made their big debut in the greater Pittsburgh region, and we hope that through our business we can diversify the available options for healthy food. The crops are grown by Pittsburgh natives for all people of Pittsburgh and aim to create a new, fun and natural way for a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<h3>What We're Asking</h3>
<p>Your contribution allows us to become <strong>self-sustaining</strong> and to start the growing process. Our funding goal permits us to grow microgreens for one year at full production, yielding up to 1008 pounds of food. We seek to raise <strong><i>$3,917.58</i></strong> to start growing microgreens, marketing the product, and begin distributing samples.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We will need $1889.74 to cover all equipment costs, $1283 for marketing, and $744.84 for product related expenses. The tables and charts below break down specific expenses we plan to cover with the funds from this fundraising campaign.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581049350/kqt3jialhauditidf7tz.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Specifics</h3>
<p><i>The crops:</i></p>
<p>Four trays will sit on each shelf, growing one of the five following crops: black oil sunflowers, green pea shoots, hong vit radish, waltham 29 broccoli, or slow bolt arugula. Each shelf is lined with 3 LED T5 22W lights and have fans constantly blowing. A dehumidifier takes care of the remaining moisture in the air to prevent mold (these plants grow densely!). </p>
<p><i>The soil:</i></p>
<p>There are many ways of growing plants indoors: hydroponically, aquaponically, medium-based; we chose to go with two types of locally sourced soils: leaf compost for its fluffy and water retentive nature, and Organic Mechanics, made from worm castings and compost, for its nutrition (no environmentally damaging peat moss!). </p>
<p><i>The water:</i></p>
<p>Water will be pH balanced, using lemon juice to bring it down to a comfortable 6.0. Before use, water will be left uncovered in order to degas any chlorine from municipality processing. Also, no lead here! Water is sourced from the North Hills, free from any lead piping found in other Pittsburgh regions.</p>
<p><i>Food safety:</i></p>
<p>Our trays will be held in food safe plastics, from beginning to end. Organic castile soap will be used to clean all containers and equipment that come in contact with the final product, preventing any chemical residue from cheap soaps. Don't forget to compost our corn-based food containers!</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few examples of what we expect the final product to look like:</strong></p>

Four trays will sit on each shelf, growing one of the five following crops: black oil sunflowers, green pea shoots, hong vit radish, waltham 29 broccoli, or slow bolt arugula. Each shelf is lined with 3 LED T5 22W lights and have fans constantly blowing. A dehumidifier takes care of the remaining moisture in the air to prevent mold (these plants grow densely!). 
The soil:
There are many ways of growing plants indoors: hydroponically, aquaponically, medium-based; we chose to go with two types of locally sourced soils: leaf compost for its fluffy and water retentive nature, and Organic Mechanics, made from worm castings and compost, for its nutrition (no environmentally damaging peat moss!). 
The water:
Water will be pH balanced, using lemon juice to bring it down to a comfortable 6.0. Before use, water will be left uncovered in order to degas any chlorine from municipality processing. Also, no lead here! Water is sourced from the North Hills, free from any lead piping found in other Pittsburgh regions.
Food safety:
Our trays will be held in food safe plastics, from beginning to end. Organic castile soap will be used to clean all containers and equipment that come in contact with the final product, preventing any chemical residue from cheap soaps. Don't forget to compost our corn-based food containers!
Here are a few examples of what we expect the final product to look like:

There, Zack learned about a powerful class of <strong>enzyme</strong>-based therapeutics produced using genetically engineered microbes. But he also learned that most of these therapies never reach the market, because purifying enzymes from the microbes that produce them is so expensive. The result: most of this technology remains either silo-ed in academia or selectively deployed commercially for only the most serious diseases.</p><p>But what if, Zack thought, we could move the enzyme-producing microbe <i>into the body </i>as a probiotic? We'd avoid the expensive purification step, and in so doing we'd be able to apply this technology to a new set of common, everyday problems. The challenge was clear: adapt this existing technology to probiotics.</p><p>In the next 6 years of his PhD, Zack studied bacterial genetic regulation and learned how to make this vision a reality. Finally, after finishing his studies and spending a year designing clinical trials, Zack founded ZBiotics in 2016.</p><p>Since then, our mission has been simple: <strong>make modern biotechnology accessible by using it to solve everyday problems</strong>. The first problem we chose was feeling better after drinking, and we've spent the last 2 years developing that product.</p><p>We're proud to say that this is the 1st ingredient invented to specifically address the next-day effects of drinking.</p><p>And we're even prouder of the fact that it's also the world's <strong>1st genetically engineered probiotic</strong>.</p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534663631/pglgbxrh9qlikhpdhmq5.png"" src=""""/></h2><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>We're confident that we will fulfill perks in the time specified, but there can always be unforeseen issues beyond our control, especially with the ambitious goal of launching the world’s 1st genetically engineered probiotic. If issues arise, we'll share them with you, work through them, and keep you updated. We’ve tackled our fair share of hurdles so far, and we’re confident that we can meet whatever new challenges we face.</p><p>Here are some potential challenges, and how we are working to mitigate them:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Regulations</strong>: ZBiotics will be fully compliant with all regulations by the time we ship. That compliance requires completion of a number of studies, most of which are already successfully complete. While all indications point to our remaining studies being successful, any delay could push back our time to market. We've mitigated this risk by engaging exceptional regulatory consultants and an experienced, certified contract research organization to design and conduct our tests.</li>
<li>
<strong>Manufacturing</strong>: We have developed a manufacturing protocol that allows us to produce our product at scale. That protocol is being upgraded to food-grade standards. If that upgrade encounters hiccups, it could delay our time to market. We are mitigating this by starting our food-grade manufacturing 6 months in advance of when we actually need product, building in time for delays.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shipping and Logistics</strong>: We will be shipping product all across the United States. We are mitigating the risk of delay-inducing complications by engaging third-party partners who have experience running direct-to-consumer distribution of consumer products. We're already in conversations with these providers now, even though we don't plan on shipping until January.</li>

Many of these have absolutely no demonstration of efficacy or even a hypothesis as to how they could possibly help you. The trend seems to be, ""let's sweep a bunch of supplements into a bottle, make up a name for it, and try to sell it as something new.""</p><p>ZBiotics is different. We looked at one of the major known causes of morning misery – acetaldehyde buildup – and bioengineered a completely new solution from scratch! We spent 2 years in the lab genetically engineering a probiotic bacteria with the hopes that it will break down acetaldehyde in your body faster, thus actually addressing the root cause of some of the worst next-day effects of alcohol! Literally no one else can say this. We invented our product specifically for this purpose, and we've patented it.</p><p>In addition, our product uses a completely new technology! When we launch, we will be literally the 1st genetically engineered probiotic to ever hit the market. This is brand new, and we think it has huge potential. We are extremely excited not just for this product, but for all the other things we think we can do with this technology!</p><h3>How do you take it?</h3><p>ZBiotics comes as probiotic suspended in water. It can be stored at room temperature – no refrigeration necessary. It works while you sleep, so you take it during a night of drinking. We’ve found it works best when taken early in the day or night, before the first drink. But it should be effective when taken anytime before bed.</p><h3>What's acetaldehyde? And what about dehydration?</h3><p>Drinking water is definitely a good practice while drinking. But believe it or not, it’s not just dehydration that’s responsible for the next-day effects of drinking alcohol. In fact, there is some really cool scientific research showing that none of the markers of dehydration correlate with hangover severity: <a href=""http://www.eurekaselect.com/94052/article"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check it out</a>. </p><p>And this makes sense. If dehydration was all there was to it, a glass of water in the morning would make you 100%. But we all know from experience that the effects of drinking can persist well into the day and be much more severe.</p><p>Some of these all-day effects are actually caused by accumulation of a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism called acetaldehyde. See more information on the effects of acetaldehyde <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427900"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282063"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. Unfortunately, your body breaks down this toxin slowly, but that's where ZBiotics comes in! We invented a probiotic bacteria engineered to break down that toxin faster, turning it into a harmless molecule called acetate (essentially vinegar).</p><p>Having responsible and healthy drinking habits – like drinking water, drinking in moderation, and not drinking on an empty stomach – are all important. ZBiotics is there to help you with that last piece of the puzzle, the acetaldehyde toxicity.</p><h3>Any peer-reviewed studies yet?</h3><p>ZBiotics breaks down acetaldehyde in a test tube (<i>in vitro</i>). Our hypothesis is that it does the same thing in the body, and while we have a number of reasons to believe that hypothesis (extensive informal testing on ourselves and some excited volunteer friends), we have yet to prove it in a marketable clinical trial.</p><p>That said, we are in the process of writing up a couple papers for submission to peer-reviewed scientific journals. We're finalizing data on the genetic engineering perspective of what we have done for publication shortly, and we are developing a clinical trial with our advisor, Dr. Joris Verster, to generate marketable efficacy data for publication soon after. As we learned when Zack designed clinical trials for drug companies, however, such trials can take substantial amounts of time and expense. We want to get ZBiotics into your hands to let you experience its efficacy for yourself as soon as possible. That’s why we’re moving to market as early as we can, even as we prepare our formal study. As soon as we have the results from our first trials, we'll be excited to share them! </p><h3>Will ZBiotics affect my level of intoxication?</h3><p>No. ZBiotics will not impact your level of intoxication. Please drink responsibly. All the same rules about alcohol safety apply. ZBiotics was built to help you celebrate in moderation.</p><h3>Does taking ZBiotics let you drink more?</h3><p>No. Alcohol is dangerous on its own, and ZBiotics will not impact the harmful effects of intoxication on the body. Also, ZBiotics is not about binge-drinking. It’s about having a fun, healthy night out without worrying about the next morning.</p><h3>How is ZBiotics regulated?</h3><p>We are testing ZBiotics to make sure that it is 100% safe before releasing it to the market. That means ZBiotics will be compliant with all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements related to food safety<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>. It will not be approved as efficacious in any way by FDA. FDA approval is reserved for drugs.</span></p><h3><font>Wait, I thought alcohol was broken down by your liver, and probiotics only stay in your intestines...

Drink ZBiotics before or during drinking, and feel better the next day.It's a toxin called acetaldehyde (not just dehydration), that causes the worst morning-after effects of drinking. Using genetic engineering, we created a probiotic bacteria that breaks down acetaldehyde. Then we put it into a drink. Here's how to use it... Step 1Drink ZBiotics before drinking alcohol (or before bed).  Step 2Works in your gut while you drink/sleep, breaking down acetaldehyde.   Step 3Wake up, enjoy your day!   Science is in our DNA...ZBiotics is the product of 2+ years of R&D by a team of PhD scientists. Since we started in 2016, our mission has remained simple: use modern biotechnology to solve everyday problems. The 1st problem we've tackled is feeling better after drinking. Now, our probiotic is built and ready to go.We're proud to say that ZBiotics is the 1st ingredient ever invented to avoid the next-day effects of drinking. And we're even prouder to say that it's the world's 1st bioengineered probiotic bacteria.  Enjoy life while preventing next-day miseryGrab ZBiotics and go out and live!Enjoy that evening glass of wine without worrying about feeling it the next day.Head out to the beach, rock your face off all day, and enjoy the next morning.Have fun at game night or the office happy hour while staying sharp for work the next day. Not just vitamins in a bottle. Real, hard science.We started with a natural, probiotic bacteria found in Japanese fermented soybean food called natto. Then we altered the probiotic's DNA so that it breaks down acetaldehyde. It does so by producing an enzyme similar to one your liver already makes...This enzyme: called ""acetaldehyde dehydrogenase""Our probiotic is engineered to produce a lot of this enzyme directly in your gut, which is actually a huge source of acetaldehyde that your liver doesn't have direct access to (citation).  Our engineered probiotic is meant to help clear this acetaldehyde sink as it forms, prepping you for a great next morning.Read more about the science here. What people are saying...PerksWe're excited to offer bottles of ZBiotics itself as the primary perk for backing us. Delivery is limited to the United States and is projected for February 2019. We will cover basic ground shipping for all of our backers.For our largest backers, look forward to our exclusive 2019 ZBiotics Launch Party, happening in San Francisco early next year. More details to come, but rest assured the ZBiotics will be flowing. Just because we're nerds doesn't mean we don't know how to throw a party. Manufacturing/Fulfillment TimelineWe’ve spent over 2 years developing ZBiotics, and now we need your help. We have a real, working prototype that we need to get to market. Your support will help fund the manufacturing and commercialization of the 1st-ever genetically engineered probiotic. Built with real science. By scientists.We're a team of PhD scientists and business professionals committed to solving everyday problems using genetically engineered probiotics.Scientific AdvisorsPartners Our StoryOur story began over a decade ago, back when co-founder Zack Abbott was working at an HIV research lab. There, Zack learned about a powerful class of enzyme-based therapeutics produced using genetically engineered microbes. But he also learned that most of these therapies never reach the market, because purifying enzymes from the microbes that produce them is so expensive. The result: most of this technology remains either silo-ed in academia or selectively deployed commercially for only the most serious diseases.But what if, Zack thought, we could move the enzyme-producing microbe into the body as a probiotic? We'd avoid the expensive purification step, and in so doing we'd be able to apply this technology to a new set of common, everyday problems. The challenge was clear: adapt this existing technology to probiotics.In the next 6 years of his PhD, Zack studied bacterial genetic regulation and learned how to make this vision a reality. Finally, after finishing his studies and spending a year designing clinical trials, Zack founded ZBiotics in 2016.Since then, our mission has been simple: make modern biotechnology accessible by using it to solve everyday problems. The first problem we chose was feeling better after drinking, and we've spent the last 2 years developing that product.We're proud to say that this is the 1st ingredient invented to specifically address the next-day effects of drinking.And we're even prouder of the fact that it's also the world's 1st genetically engineered probiotic. Risks and ChallengesWe're confident that we will fulfill perks in the time specified, but there can always be unforeseen issues beyond our control, especially with the ambitious goal of launching the world’s 1st genetically engineered probiotic. If issues arise, we'll share them with you, work through them, and keep you updated. We’ve tackled our fair share of hurdles so far, and we’re confident that we can meet whatever new challenges we face.Here are some potential challenges, and how we are working to mitigate them:

Regulations: ZBiotics will be fully compliant with all regulations by the time we ship. That compliance requires completion of a number of studies, most of which are already successfully complete. While all indications point to our remaining studies being successful, any delay could push back our time to market. We've mitigated this risk by engaging exceptional regulatory consultants and an experienced, certified contract research organization to design and conduct our tests.

Manufacturing: We have developed a manufacturing protocol that allows us to produce our product at scale. That protocol is being upgraded to food-grade standards. If that upgrade encounters hiccups, it could delay our time to market. We are mitigating this by starting our food-grade manufacturing 6 months in advance of when we actually need product, building in time for delays.

Shipping and Logistics: We will be shipping product all across the United States. We are mitigating the risk of delay-inducing complications by engaging third-party partners who have experience running direct-to-consumer distribution of consumer products. We're already in conversations with these providers now, even though we don't plan on shipping until January.
 FAQsHow is this different from all the other stuff out there?All other products on the market today are just different mixes of the same 6-10 off-the-shelf vitamins and plant extracts. Many of these have absolutely no demonstration of efficacy or even a hypothesis as to how they could possibly help you. The trend seems to be, ""let's sweep a bunch of supplements into a bottle, make up a name for it, and try to sell it as something new.""ZBiotics is different. We looked at one of the major known causes of morning misery – acetaldehyde buildup – and bioengineered a completely new solution from scratch! We spent 2 years in the lab genetically engineering a probiotic bacteria with the hopes that it will break down acetaldehyde in your body faster, thus actually addressing the root cause of some of the worst next-day effects of alcohol! Literally no one else can say this. We invented our product specifically for this purpose, and we've patented it.In addition, our product uses a completely new technology! When we launch, we will be literally the 1st genetically engineered probiotic to ever hit the market. This is brand new, and we think it has huge potential. We are extremely excited not just for this product, but for all the other things we think we can do with this technology!How do you take it?ZBiotics comes as probiotic suspended in water. It can be stored at room temperature – no refrigeration necessary. It works while you sleep, so you take it during a night of drinking. We’ve found it works best when taken early in the day or night, before the first drink. But it should be effective when taken anytime before bed.What's acetaldehyde? And what about dehydration?Drinking water is definitely a good practice while drinking. But believe it or not, it’s not just dehydration that’s responsible for the next-day effects of drinking alcohol. In fact, there is some really cool scientific research showing that none of the markers of dehydration correlate with hangover severity: check it out. And this makes sense. If dehydration was all there was to it, a glass of water in the morning would make you 100%. But we all know from experience that the effects of drinking can persist well into the day and be much more severe.Some of these all-day effects are actually caused by accumulation of a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism called acetaldehyde. See more information on the effects of acetaldehyde here and here. Unfortunately, your body breaks down this toxin slowly, but that's where ZBiotics comes in! We invented a probiotic bacteria engineered to break down that toxin faster, turning it into a harmless molecule called acetate (essentially vinegar).Having responsible and healthy drinking habits – like drinking water, drinking in moderation, and not drinking on an empty stomach – are all important. ZBiotics is there to help you with that last piece of the puzzle, the acetaldehyde toxicity.Any peer-reviewed studies yet?ZBiotics breaks down acetaldehyde in a test tube (in vitro). Our hypothesis is that it does the same thing in the body, and while we have a number of reasons to believe that hypothesis (extensive informal testing on ourselves and some excited volunteer friends), we have yet to prove it in a marketable clinical trial.That said, we are in the process of writing up a couple papers for submission to peer-reviewed scientific journals. We're finalizing data on the genetic engineering perspective of what we have done for publication shortly, and we are developing a clinical trial with our advisor, Dr. Joris Verster, to generate marketable efficacy data for publication soon after. As we learned when Zack designed clinical trials for drug companies, however, such trials can take substantial amounts of time and expense. We want to get ZBiotics into your hands to let you experience its efficacy for yourself as soon as possible. That’s why we’re moving to market as early as we can, even as we prepare our formal study. As soon as we have the results from our first trials, we'll be excited to share them! Will ZBiotics affect my level of intoxication?No. ZBiotics will not impact your level of intoxication. Please drink responsibly. All the same rules about alcohol safety apply. ZBiotics was built to help you celebrate in moderation.Does taking ZBiotics let you drink more?No. Alcohol is dangerous on its own, and ZBiotics will not impact the harmful effects of intoxication on the body. Also, ZBiotics is not about binge-drinking. It’s about having a fun, healthy night out without worrying about the next morning.How is ZBiotics regulated?We are testing ZBiotics to make sure that it is 100% safe before releasing it to the market. That means ZBiotics will be compliant with all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements related to food safety. It will not be approved as efficacious in any way by FDA. FDA approval is reserved for drugs.Wait, I thought alcohol was broken down by your liver, and probiotics only stay in your intestines... How could this help?We actually get this question a lot. A bit of the science for those folks who are keen on digging into this at a deeper level:A key piece of the puzzle to understanding ZBiotics is that the colon itself is in fact a huge sink and source of acetaldehyde. In fact, while blood acetaldehyde concentrations are at around 70-80µM after a night of heavy drinking, colonic acetaldehyde concentrations can reach as high as 300-400µM. This is somewhat because small amounts of acetaldehyde produced in the liver gets into your blood and then diffisues into the colon, but more importantly (and interestingly!) there is a fair bit of de novo synthesis of acetaldehyde in the gut by intestinal epithelial alcohol dehydrogenases and by your microbiome in response to alcohol consumption (here's one citation from peer-reviewed literature, but there are many: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8811162?dopt=Abstract). So our hypothesis was that if we can drain this huge sink of acetaldehyde in the colon, not only can we draw more acetaldehyde out of the blood and into the colon by creating a concentration gradient, we can also prevent colon-derived acetaldehyde from diffusing OUT of the gut and raising your blood acetaldehyde.So, in short, the enzymes our bacteria are making have access to their substrate (acetaldehyde) directly in the colon, circumventing the need for enzyme to be somehow secreted from the bacteria and absorbed into the bloodstream.How can I help spread the word?Ask your friends to help support us by sharing the link to this page!

We're excited to add Kombucha PicoPaks to the lineup, initially in three great flavors: Classic Lemon ($14.99), Ginger Malt ($16.99) and Lemon Malt ($16.99). Kombucha, a fermented tea, is a popular beverage in the health and wellness community that is said to aid digestion and stimulate the immune system. Pico users may brew kombucha PicoPaks in their Picos like they brew craft beer: simply insert a PicoPak, load a keg and reservoir with water, and select “brew”. Once PicoPak kombucha is brewed users may add a SCOBY (the bacteria and yeast starter culture) to their fermenting keg and let it ferment for approximately 7 days.

And it doesn't get any fresher than brewing it yourself! SelectionExplore PicoPaks from craft brewers and breweries around the world. PersonalizationWith Pico, you can personalize great brewery recipes to your taste by dialing up or down the IBUs (bitterness) and ABV at brewtime.  Craft beer your way! Saving the EnvironmentProducing beer at large commercial breweries involves transporting all that beer + metal cans or glass bottles over thousands of miles:  lots of pollution and energy waste.   Instead, brew local using your own water, then compost your PicoPaks or even feed the spent grain to your livestock.    PicoBrew's global marketplace for PicoPaks, the BrewMarketplace, allows customers to find great craft beer by exploring ratings and recommendations and even communicating directly with the brewer. BrewMarketplace allows you to discover and purchase not only great craft brewery PicoPaks but also Paks designed by other homebrewers with unique and exciting recipes. Discover the next great brewmaster's recipes, support your local craft brew community, or explore great beer from around the world. Finding your beer has never been easier! Meet our Brewery Partners  Now Pico brews more than beer! We're excited to add Kombucha PicoPaks to the lineup, initially in three great flavors: Classic Lemon ($14.99), Ginger Malt ($16.99) and Lemon Malt ($16.99). Kombucha, a fermented tea, is a popular beverage in the health and wellness community that is said to aid digestion and stimulate the immune system. Pico users may brew kombucha PicoPaks in their Picos like they brew craft beer: simply insert a PicoPak, load a keg and reservoir with water, and select “brew”. Once PicoPak kombucha is brewed users may add a SCOBY (the bacteria and yeast starter culture) to their fermenting keg and let it ferment for approximately 7 days. Coming soon to BrewMarketplace! The FreeStyle PicoPak BrewCrafter gives you the ability to create your own unique craft beers by simply dragging and dropping grains and hops into your custom PicoPak so you can achieve the flavor and style you desire! PicoBrew does the heavy lifting of sourcing ingredients and packaging your creation to deliver a truly customized and unique craft brewing experience.  Manage your craft brewing life with our new BrewPulse mobile app:  its your whole craft beer pipeline at your fingertips!  This new iPhone and Android app allows you to explore new PicoPaks but also keeps you up to date throughout the brewing process. You can monitor each of your creations as it progresses from brewing through fermentation and carbonation and finally into your refrigerator for consumption. Shop. Explore. Brew. Enjoy. 
PicoStill is a first-of-its-kind, patent-pending distilling attachment that is compatible with all Pico® and Zymatic® brewing appliances. PicoStill is a gorgeous accessory topped with a sleek copper distilling coil and clear glass infusion chamber that fits over the Pico C Keg and can be used to distill hop oil, water, and essential oils. (Of course, with proper licenses and permits, the PicoStill can be used to distill delicious spirits as well).

 
PicoPaks are ready-to-brew compostable grains-and-hops ingredient kits together with the secret brewmaster process parameters to brew them. Our PicoPaks are produced in collaboration with and are licensed from award-winning breweries worldwide.    Each PicoPak is recognized instantly by its RFID tag as it is inserted into your Pico. Recipe control parameters that guide heating and fluid flows are then downloaded automatically over WiFi to enable total precision craft beer-brewing.  
  With a Pico you are not only brewing award-winning recipes from all over the globe, you are brewing them on award-winning equipment. PicoBrew has been the recipient of many prestigious awards and honors including 3 CES Innovation Awards, an IFA Best of Show, multiple Editor's Choice picks... We've received so many awards, in fact, that Fast Company recently named PicoBrew one of the 2017 Top 10 Innovative Food Companies in the World!   We founded PicoBrew in 2010 with the vision of democratizing craft beer by allowing anyone to brew their own great beer leveraging the expertise of the craft beer community.   In 2013 we launched the world's first fully automatic all-grain beer brewing appliance, the PicoBrew Zymatic.   After two more years of hard work we launched the PicoBrew Pico (Model S), the world's first true consumer countertop craft beer appliance, and along the way invented the PicoPak compostable grains and hops recipe pack as well as partnerships with hundreds of craft brewers around the world.   The Pico Model C is the simplest, most affordable craft brewing appliance ever, and builds on 7 years of pioneering and leadership in the craft beer space.   PicoBrew is a team of 57 dedicated craft beer lovers and technologists (in that order) who cut their teeth in various respectable roles at big companies, but decided it was much better to work for a small company and make products that make people happy. We like great craft beer, and it makes us happy to craft the ultimate crafter of craft beer for you!",34.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>What kind of eatery will it be?</h3>
<p>Prairie Moon will be a unique full-service bakery, restaurant, and bar. Craftmanship and quality at a reasonable cost will be our hallmark. All of the recipes have already been invented, tested, and found delicious. The menu will include: pastries, sandwiches, curries, stir-fries, salads, smoothies, adult beverages, pastas, fried foods, raw dishes, pancakes...and more. This place will be a culinary bridge that appeals from everyone from the health-food lover to the  fried-food fan. Hours will be weekday evenings and all-day weekends. We will need to hire around 10 people from the community. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who's Behind Prairie Moon?</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Trina Reid and I have had a little part-time vegan baked goods wholesaling business for the past six years in the Madison area. I have been renting time at a fully equipped shared ""business incubation"" kitchen; then selling to a couple shops, have had booths  at small farmer's markets and at some fests. I have learned a lot over the years and am now looking to make the dream of a full-fledged restaurant come true. </p>
<p>I love feeding people and have spent the past twenty years working on decadent plant-based recipes to share with friends, family, and almost anyone I happen to come across. This restaurant will feel like a type of sanctuary.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Pledge money and select a reward.</p>
<p>Spread the word to others who might be interested. Use email, Facebook, and word-of-mouth to get the word out.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What do you get for your support?</h3>
<p>Fabulous food and bonus items! You will receive an equal value of your donation returned to you in the form of yummy food and bonus gifts. Emotional warm fuzzes and a great place to hang out will also be yours.</p>
<p>What if you don't live in this part of the country and have no plans to visit?</p>
<p>We will then need to come up with a plan to ship food to you (in the US only). Pastries and chocolates are the easiest to ship, but any item that handles being frozen well could be an option. If food is being shipped it will be a significantly  smaller amount (1/4 to 1/3)  than if picking up due to costs of packing materials, cold packs, and actual shipping.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Nitty Gritty of What is Needed</h3>
<p>Founding is required to secure a bank loan for $95,000 that is needed to open the doors. Starting a restaurant is expensive and I have only had to purchase lots of small items while previously (and currently) renting at a shared incubation kitchen. The starting costs are needed for the following: Deposit on building $10,000, Heavy Equipment $35,000, Working Capital $20,000, Food and Beverage Ingredients $7,000, Repair Front Façade of Building $5,000, Repairs &amp; Alterations to Kitchen $10,000, Installation Costs $3000, and Fees $5,000. I am looking for help in gaining the minimal 10% of required funds towards a small business bank loan.</p>
<p>If this campaign does not reach it's goal and the funding process becomes severely delayed on acquiring a physical location , I will still have access to a rental kitchen to be able to get goodies to you. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where will it be located?</h3>
<p>I have found my dream restaurant location with a tall tin-tile lined ceiling and an outdoor patio at a reasonable price in Columbus Wisconsin 20 minutes drive from the eastern edge of Madison Wisconsin. The building that I've fallen in love with is a hundred years old and was recently a restaurant that could seat 40 inside. I think this town would be a good location in that there is a shortage of restaurants in the area serving anything besides meat-heavy bar food and fast-food. I have heard so many people in town wishing for a place that had salads or interesting ethic flavors. Three major highways pass through the town and it has an Amtrak station. Although Madison proper would seem a more expected location, the competition is high there and the rent for a similarly fabulous place is quadruple. All of the loan request prices are assuming the acquisition  of a particular building in Columbus.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk for all new restaurants is undercapitalization...lack of money at the beginning to cover expenses while the new business is gaining momentum. I am requesting $20,000 of the bank loan to be set aside for working capital to cover expenses in the first four months in case it takes a little while for sales to take off.</p>
<p>Location. If someone else snaps up the location it will be improbable of finding something else as nice. Known backup possibilities include another location in Columbus without outdoor seating, a spot in Sun Prairie and one on the far east side of Madison.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our location at 1512 Robert C. Blakes Sr. Drive (before &amp; after)</i></p>
<p><strong>Our inaugural products, 504Hibiscus and 504BananasFoster, are hand-crafted with a variety of spices, botanicals and citrus, infused over time in a premium white rum. </strong>Whole ingredients such as hibiscus petals, as well as bananas and limes dehydrated by hand, make these products stand out with the familiar and beloved smells and flavors of Louisiana and the Caribbean. Never back-sweetened, 504Hibiscus and 504BananasFoster are perfect for sipping and enjoying. In a traditional daiquiri or a sparking lemonade, 504Hibiscus is a star. In a holiday drink such as eggnog or cooking up a rummy bread pudding, 504BananasFoster is everything right with the world. We use locally-sourced products wherever available, and all 504Rum is crafted from Louisiana sugarcane.</p>

<p>As an industry, craft spirits is only now finding its footing again after the effects of Prohibition. As a result, there is a very heavy system of red-tape, procedures and permitting at the federal, state and city levels.

This is a great start, and we are actively working now to secure our state and city permits.

<p>Additionally, our space is still under active construction. Before we can begin production, we need a few more key improvements to bring our building up to code. We've made great time, thanks our <i>wonderful</i> contractor and construction team, but we've still got a ways to go. </p>

</div></div>","NEW STRETCH GOAL OF $30,000. LET’S CELEBRATE AS A COMMUNITY. PLEASE SEE UPDATE.
 
Welcome! (Bienvenue !)

Happy Raptor Distilling, LLC was founded in 2017 by three friends and former next-door neighbors: Mark, Meagen and Peter. Our mission at Happy Raptor is to produce quality craft spirits in an environment dedicated to our culture, community, and doing the things that bring us joy. Our team at Happy Raptor is proud to share in the resilience, tenacity and passion that keeps our city growing and thriving as a small business and scrappy new startup. We can't wait to become a staple of our new neighborhood, turning a graffiti-covered shed into something special -- with your help!
 

Our location at 1512 Robert C. Blakes Sr. Drive (before & after)
Our inaugural products, 504Hibiscus and 504BananasFoster, are hand-crafted with a variety of spices, botanicals and citrus, infused over time in a premium white rum. Whole ingredients such as hibiscus petals, as well as bananas and limes dehydrated by hand, make these products stand out with the familiar and beloved smells and flavors of Louisiana and the Caribbean. Never back-sweetened, 504Hibiscus and 504BananasFoster are perfect for sipping and enjoying. In a traditional daiquiri or a sparking lemonade, 504Hibiscus is a star. In a holiday drink such as eggnog or cooking up a rummy bread pudding, 504BananasFoster is everything right with the world. We use locally-sourced products wherever available, and all 504Rum is crafted from Louisiana sugarcane.
For more background details on our team's especially unique and useful mix of skills or the Caribbean tradition of the rhum arrangé that inspires our products, visit the FAQ's. 
 

Our two inaugural products: 504Hibiscus and 504BananasFoster

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Todo empezó en la Universidad… Allí los dos nos hicimos conscientes de
todo lo que nos quedaba por descrubrir y aprender, así que decidimos ponernos a
ello y hacerlo juntos, porque los sueños son mejores compartidos. Nos fuimos a
explorar nuevos países, a aprender de nueva gente y de nuevas formas de vida.
No queremos dejar de hacerlo, no queremos perdernos lo que el mundo tiene para
nosotros y aún no hemos descubierto.</span><span style=""font-family: Cambria;""></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Y no sólo queremos recibir, queremos compartir con todos los que
podamos nuestra ilusión y las cosas maravillosas que nos vamos encontrando en
cada lugar. Por eso decidimos crear algo nuestro, algo con lo que llevar una cucharada de ilusión y felicidad a tantos sitios como podamos. Así surgió la
idea de ""The Cool Club"".</span><span style=""font-family: Cambria;""></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Helados y estilo americano de los años 50, esta es la forma mas
sencilla de describir nuestra idea, pero hay mucho más detrás. Esa pequeña cosa
que ves, oyes, hueles… esa pequeña cosa que, no sabes lo que es, pero te hace
sentir feliz, te hace sentir que todo está bien y sólo quieres quedarte allí.
Esto es lo que queremos construir; no perseguimos sólo un negocio, perseguimos
una forma de vivir.</span><span style=""font-family: Cambria;""></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Queremos crear una furgoneta de helados vintage, al más puro estilo
americano de los 50, de esas de las líneas redonditas, de las que todo el mundo
señala cuando la ven pasar, las que te transportan a los 50, donde se hablaba

Apostamos por sabores novedosos y cambiamos el cono o la tarrina (aunque si los
prefieres también los tenemos) por deliciosas cookies caseras, no galletas

por encima, las de chocolate blanco, o incluso un esponjoso brownie. </span><span style=""font-family: Cambria;""></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""ES"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Everything started in College… We both realized that there is so much
out there to </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">discover and learn in this world. We decided to start soon and to do it together, because dreams
are better shared. We explored new countries to learn from new people and from
new ways to live. We don’t want to stop, we don’t want to miss what the world
has for us and we haven’t seen yet.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""ES"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">And we don’t only want to receive, we want to share with everyone our experiences and the wonderful things we
find in each place. So we decided to create something of our own, something to share
a bite of hope and happiness at as many places as we can. This is how
the idea of “The Cool Club” started.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><b style=""""><span lang=""ES"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">WHAT IS “THE COOL
CLUB”</span></b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Ice Cream and American 50’s style - this is
the simplest way to describe our idea. But there is much more to it. That
little thing you see, you hear, you smell… that little thing that you do not
know what it is but makes you feel happy, makes you feel like everything is
good and you just want to stay there. This is what we want to build; we are not
only creating a business, we are creating a way to live. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">We are building a vintage ice cream van in the
50’s American Style, one with round edges that everyone points to when they see
it; one that brings you back to the fifties, back when they talked in “doo wop” choirs” and when everything
was pastel colored.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">But not everything will be classic: we want to
give our ""Classic ice cream"" a modern and fresh touch. We focus on
innovative flavors and substitute the cone or cup for delicious handmade
cookies (though we will still have cones and cups for those who just have
them). Our cookies are not just regular cookies. No, they are authentic cookies
with chocolate chips, cinnamon, white chocolate and, why not, brownie. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">It’s as easy as: COOKIE + ICE + CREAM = THE

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">Our top priority is exceptional quality of our
products. Our ice cream is smooth and creamy and made with all natural

incorporate modern popular flavors. </span></p>

CÓMO EMPEZÓ
Todo empezó en la Universidad… Allí los dos nos hicimos conscientes de
todo lo que nos quedaba por descrubrir y aprender, así que decidimos ponernos a
ello y hacerlo juntos, porque los sueños son mejores compartidos. Nos fuimos a
explorar nuevos países, a aprender de nueva gente y de nuevas formas de vida.
No queremos dejar de hacerlo, no queremos perdernos lo que el mundo tiene para
nosotros y aún no hemos descubierto.
Y no sólo queremos recibir, queremos compartir con todos los que
podamos nuestra ilusión y las cosas maravillosas que nos vamos encontrando en
cada lugar. Por eso decidimos crear algo nuestro, algo con lo que llevar una cucharada de ilusión y felicidad a tantos sitios como podamos. Así surgió la
idea de ""The Cool Club"".
QUÉ ES “THE COOL CLUB”
Helados y estilo americano de los años 50, esta es la forma mas
sencilla de describir nuestra idea, pero hay mucho más detrás. Esa pequeña cosa
que ves, oyes, hueles… esa pequeña cosa que, no sabes lo que es, pero te hace
sentir feliz, te hace sentir que todo está bien y sólo quieres quedarte allí.
Esto es lo que queremos construir; no perseguimos sólo un negocio, perseguimos
una forma de vivir.
Queremos crear una furgoneta de helados vintage, al más puro estilo
americano de los 50, de esas de las líneas redonditas, de las que todo el mundo
señala cuando la ven pasar, las que te transportan a los 50, donde se hablaba
haciendo coros “doo wop” y donde todo era color pastel.
Pero no todo será clásico: queremos darle a nuestra “heladería
clásica” un toque actual y fresco.
Apostamos por sabores novedosos y cambiamos el cono o la tarrina (aunque si los
prefieres también los tenemos) por deliciosas cookies caseras, no galletas
sino las autenticas cookies, las de pepitas de chocolate, las que llevan canela
por encima, las de chocolate blanco, o incluso un esponjoso brownie. 
Tan fácil como: COOKIE + HELADO + COOKIE = THE COOL CLUB ICE CREAM SANDWICH
Nuestra prioridad es la excepcional calidad de nuestros productos. Nuestros helados son suaves y cremosos y hechos con ingredientes naturales y con galletas caseras, las que se hacen
en el horno de la abuela, pero eso sí, a la ultima moda en gustos.
PORQUÉ UNA FURGONETA… Y PORQUÉ HELADOS
Decidimos usar una furgoneta porque queremos llegar a todos los
lugares que podamos, repartiendo el espiritu “Cool”. 
¿Por qué helados? Porque los helados son vacaciones, son días de
playa, son atardeceres  junto al
mar o paseos con tu novi@. Son fiestas de cumpleaños con tus amigos o noches
de peli en casa. Los helados son diversión en medio de un
festival entre concierto y concierto, son un “porque me apetece”…  Los helados nos encantan y siempre es
un buen momento para uno. ¿Puede alguien estar triste mientras se come un
helado? ¿Hay algo más cool que un helado? 
Queremos trasladar a Europa (de una punta a otra) la esencia del Food
Truck Americano. Nos encanta la idea de poder comer algo de calidad en
cualquier sitio y en el momento en que te apetece.
Un mes en la playa más soleada del Mediterráneo, al siguiente nos
vamos al país vecino pero parando en un festival de música, de cine o de arte, para después estar contigo celebrando tu fiesta de cumpleaños o en la boda de
tus amigos.
NUESTRO COMPROMISO
Queremos que nuestro Club sea de la mayor calidad posible y para ello
intentaremos hacer todo lo que podamos:
- El 5% de nuestros beneficios anuales los destinaremos a una asociacion de lucha contra la malnutrición infantil, porque sabemos que los niños no sólo necesitan helados para ser felices.
- Estamos
comprometidos con el medio ambiente, por lo que usaremos materiales reciclabes
así como energías limpias, intentando siempre mejorar en este sentido, porque
un mundo con unos helados tan ricos merece la pena ser cuidado.
- Prometemos la mejor atención al cliente que nunca hayas tenido. Con una sonrisa y cuidando cada cucharada, serviremos a cada cliente como si sirviéramos a nuestros mejores amigos. 
QUÉ NECESITAMOS

Necesitamos tu ayuda para conseguir 15.000 € para restaurar y transformar nuestra furgoneta en
una auténtica furgoneta de helados al estilo de los 50.
Necesitamos:
- Hacer una puesta a punto completa a la furgoneta, ya que es un
vehículo con bastantes años y necesita cambios y arreglos de mecánica.
- Equiparla interiormente para transformarla en una heladería completa
(con congelador, vitrina de conservación de los helados, grifos, armarios,
suelo y paredes adaptadas, etc.) que cumpla con todas las normas de salud e higiene para los alimentos.
- Abrir un portón lateral en la furgoneta para poder atender desde ahí
a los clientes.
- Arreglar todos los desperfectos de la chapa.
- Pintarla y ponerla bonita.
-
Tramitar todos los papeles y homologaciones necesarias.
Queremos que todo el mundo forme parte de nuestro sueño.
¡GRACIAS POR TU AYUDA!

HOW IT BEGAN
Everything started in College… We both realized that there is so much
out there to discover and learn in this world. We decided to start soon and to do it together, because dreams
are better shared. We explored new countries to learn from new people and from
new ways to live. We don’t want to stop, we don’t want to miss what the world
has for us and we haven’t seen yet.
And we don’t only want to receive, we want to share with everyone our experiences and the wonderful things we
find in each place. So we decided to create something of our own, something to share
a bite of hope and happiness at as many places as we can. This is how
the idea of “The Cool Club” started.
WHAT IS “THE COOL
CLUB”
Ice Cream and American 50’s style - this is
the simplest way to describe our idea. But there is much more to it. That
little thing you see, you hear, you smell… that little thing that you do not
know what it is but makes you feel happy, makes you feel like everything is
good and you just want to stay there. This is what we want to build; we are not
only creating a business, we are creating a way to live. 
We are building a vintage ice cream van in the
50’s American Style, one with round edges that everyone points to when they see
it; one that brings you back to the fifties, back when they talked in “doo wop” choirs” and when everything
was pastel colored.
But not everything will be classic: we want to
give our ""Classic ice cream"" a modern and fresh touch. We focus on
innovative flavors and substitute the cone or cup for delicious handmade
cookies (though we will still have cones and cups for those who just have
them). Our cookies are not just regular cookies. No, they are authentic cookies
with chocolate chips, cinnamon, white chocolate and, why not, brownie. 
It’s as easy as: COOKIE + ICE + CREAM = THE
COOL CLUB ICE CREAM SANDWICH 
Our top priority is exceptional quality of our
products. Our ice cream is smooth and creamy and made with all natural
ingredients and our artisan cookies are made fresh in grandma’s oven and
incorporate modern popular flavors. 
WHY
A VAN... AND WHY ICE CREAM
We decided to use a van because we want to
reach as many places as possible, spreading the spirit of ""Cool"".
Why ice cream? Because ice cream is vacation, it
is days on the beach, sunsets by the sea or walks with your boyfriend. It is birthday
parties with friends or movies at night at home. Ice cream is fun times at a
festival between concerts. Ice cream is “just because I feel like it""...
We love ice cream and there is never a bad time for one. Can someone be sad
while eating ice cream? Is there anything cooler than ice cream?
We want to spread the essence of the American
Food Truck across Europe, from one end to the other. We love the idea of eating
something of high quality anywhere and anytime you want.  
One month we will be at a sunny Mediterranean
beach; next month we go to the neighbouring country and stopping at several music, film and art festivals; and the following month we will be with you
celebrating your birthday and your friend’s wedding.
OUR
COMMITMENT
We want our Club to be a quality club and
will do as much as we can: 
- 5% of our annual profits will be donated to
an association to combat child malnutrition because we know that children not
only need ice cream to be happy. 

- We are committed to the environment, so
we will use recyclable materials and clean energy, always trying to improve on
this, because a world with such yummy ice cream is worth preserving.
- We promise the best customer service you
will ever experience. With a smile on our faces and a caring scoop, we will
serve every one of our customers like we serve our best friends.
WHAT WE
NEED
We need your help
to raise €15,000 to restore
and transform our van into an authentic 50’s style ice cream van.
We need: 
-  A complete restoration of the mecahnical
parts of van as it is a vehicle with many years and requires replacement and repair of parts.
 
 

- Equip the inside to transform it into a complete
ice cream van (with a freezer and ice cream storage showcase, sinks, cupboards,
adapted flooring and walls...) that meets all health and food hygiene standards.
- Open a side door
on the van so we can cater the customer from there.
- Fix any defect of the
sheet.
- Paint it to make
it BEAUTIFUL.
- Do all paperwork and approvals.
We want to make everyone part of our dream.

Our people love coffee and value the people inside our community. Kongalbaegi cooperative first started to help our hearing-impaired co-workers in our society. We also consistently developed coffee to discover and share the excellence of coffee into the world. From the result of our effort, we have made the new Handless coffee temper “DAZIM-HL”. In our cooperative there are engineers, programmers, designers, baristas, roasters and more who love coffee and they are all putting full effort to make our coffee days better.“DAZIM-HL” is a tool(tamper) that barista’s need when making coffee. From our product, this process can be done in a more convenient and effective way. DAZIM-HL can provide hearing-impaired individuals with a much smoother process in their roasting actions. Comparing to people with no handicaps, hearing-impaired people have difficulty gathering information and knowledge about the roasting process. Our product can be a key solution to this problem and let hearing-impaired people overcome this stage.We also want to give education courses for hearing-impaired people. Currently there are no classes for hearing-impaired people on coffee and roasting processes.Kongalbaegi cooperative is currently developing a roasting monitoring tool and it is almost complete. Your support can shift our process ahead for the roasting field on hearing-impaired people.Tamping is an important element in deciding the taste of your coffee.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I am in the process of opening Hillsborough's  first craft beer focused venue. Sheffield has a wide range of craft beer shops and pubs, but none in Hillsborough as yet. Pangolin  Craft Beer will provide a large revolving range of high quality Craft Beer sourced locally, nationally and internationally.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Us and Our Project</strong></p>
<p>My name is Nick and as well as being a huge fan of craft beer, I have worked in the industry for approximately 5 years in Sheffield. As such I am now in a position to undertake my own venue in Hillsborough.</p>
<p>The Craft Beer Industry has consistently grown over the past few years with new breweries and outlets opening across the UK. Independent retailers provide an important route to market within the industry as well as providing customers with new and exciting products. </p>
<p>Pangolin Craft Beer will stock a large revolving range of draft and packaged beers from some of the best and most exciting breweries out there. Everything from lagers, pales and IPAs to sours, saisons and imperial stouts in your local craft beer venue.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Support</strong></p>
<p>Pangolin Craft Beer has been a concept for some time and whilst basic funding is in place, further investment will enable us to be even better when we open.</p>
<p>The £1500 we hope to raise will help us:</p>
<p>1. Source high end equipment to house and serve cask and keg draft beer in the best possible condition.</p>
<p>2. Purchase and maintain an even wider range of stock than currently planned.</p>
<p>3. Potentially add a range of craft beer books that could be read or borrowed by customers.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the full goal any funds received will be put to good use ensuring Pangolin Craft Beer is in the best possible shape to serve the community.</p>
<p><strong>Whats In It For You?</strong></p>
<p>As well as our eternal thanks we've also got a few tangible rewards to show our gratitude.</p>
<p>- For a £10 investment we will furnish you with a branded tote bag to show off where you've got those sweet beers from!</p>
<p>- For a £25 investment we will provide you with a 2 litre glass growler (that's approx 3 and a half pints in real terms)  for taking home our tasty draft beers and a branded tote bag.</p>
<p>- For a £50 investment we will provide you with a tote bag and growler and even give you your first growler fill free of charge.</p>
<p>- For a £100 investment we will provide you with 10% off all takeout purchases for our first 3 months of opening along with a tote bag and a filled 2 Litre growler.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I decided to make the Crossroads my creative home. Since then, I have run my photography studio on 18th Street between Wyandotte and Baltimore and enjoyed the fun, friends and food in the most artistic neighborhood in Kansas City.</p>
<p>When I learned that the building housing YJ's was being sold and that YJ's was moving to the Westside neighborhood, I knew I had to do something to preserve the 90-year tradition of a tiny snack bar on 18th Street! </p>
<p>Carrying on the snack bar's tradition, WHEAT will feature a limited menu of healthy daily specials and plenty of snacks for the busy artists and professionals that make the Crossroads their home.</p>
<p>We want to be a true ""Neighborhood Table"" and community hang out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are not opening a full-scale restaurant. We want to make simple dishes for the neighborhood. But even keeping it simple, commercial refrigerators, toasters, griddles and ice machines are expensive. We are budgeting $18,000 for cleaning/repairs, signage, inventory, kitchen equipment, furnishings, fixtures, a new awning, start up costs, etc.</li>
<li>Keeping our renovations small and mainly cosmetic will not only preserve the rich history of the Crossroads' favorite snack bar, but it will also get us up and going faster, with better prices on breakfast, lunch and snacks for our friends. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Let's work together to keep a locally-owned snack shop that we can all afford, in the place we live and work every day. We can all enjoy a friendly hang-out with coffee and healthy food where we feel at home. </p>

Mary's Vine is the collaboration of a family of 5 who are trying to turn a 1903 Croatian church that was abandoned into a place where people can gather with friends and family once again. The building was falling apart and needed some immediate intervention if it was to be saved. We have already attended to the items to make the building habitable again. Now we are focusing on transforming the building to the end goal. Enter the wine lounge and restaurant. Our vision is for Mary's Vine to be an upscale wine lounge that highlights the versatility of wine and appreciation for the different styles and techniques. We will be building out a full kitchen to support the wine through pairings that enhance the taste of the wine and cuisine.

But we also need to be recognized for our talents and abilities to be able to take on roles in other areas--as women farmers, entrepreneurs and saleswomen of our very own coffee at a fair price. During these past years, we have been able to show our communities and the men in our communities that we can contribute. Now our efforts are being recognized, and we are given a space to interact through others. And what we do is seen with value. Nosotras las mujeres merecemos tener más espacio ante la sociedad y que nos valoren no solo por ser mamas o por hacer oficios de la casa, también necesitamos que se reconozcan nuestras capacidades para poder desempeñarnos en otros ámbitos y como mujeres campesinas, emprendedoras y vendedoras de nuestro café a precio justo. En estos años hemos podido enseñar en nuestras veredas, a nuestros hombres, que nosotras podemos aportar. Hoy ellos nos reconocen y nos dan un espacio  para interactuar a través de otros y que  lo que hacemos  se vea con mucha altura.If we received a fair price for our coffee, we would have other ways to give our kids a foot in the door for other opportunities such as higher education. Since our kids barely finish high school, they don’t have the opportunities to create small busineses—they are day workers. The girls have to help the mothers because their economic situation doesn’t allow the mothers to study. As for health, we would be able to have decent health…This project brings us hope because our life would change for the better.Nosotras si tuviéramos un precio justo por la venta del café, tendríamos otras entradas para poder ofrecerle a nuestros hijos que puedan ir a estudios superiores, porque los hijos se nos quedan escasamente terminando bachillerato, no tienen oportunidades ni de formar una microempresa, están de jornaleros. A las niñas, les toca ayudar a la mamá porque la situación económica no nos permite que estudien. En el tema de salud, nosotros tendríamos una salud digna…Este proyecto es la esperanza porque nuestra vida cambiaría para mejor.This project “Coffee For Rights” for us means opening spaces in society and being able to improve the quality of life for our families. As women coffee growers, we’re tired of producing beans, selling the raw coffee, and not getting what we deserve for the work we put in. Coffee For Rights is our hope. Para nosotras este proyecto de Café por los Derechos significa seguir logrando espacios ante la sociedad, y poder ayudar a la calidad de vida de nuestras familias. Nosotras somos cafeteras, y estamos cansadas de producir el grano, de venderlo en materia prima y no recibir lo que merecemos por nuestro trabajo. Para nosotras, Café con Derechos es esperanza.You contribute to the world when you donate for “Coffee for rights” because through us, you are building peace. We think of peace as being able to improve all aspects of our conditions of life. Thanks to your contributions, from this small corner of Colombia, we will be able cultivate our coffee and ultimately cultivate peace.Usted le aporta al mundo, cuando dona a “Café por los derechos” porque a través de nosotras forja paz. Nosotras pensamos que la paz es poder mejorar en todos los aspectos nuestras condiciones de vida y en este rinconcito de Colombia gracias a sus aportes podemos sembrar el café, que es sembrar paz.OUR Region / Nuestra Región
El Cañón de Las Hermosas is a rural región of Colombia. It is located in Tolima, at the top of the Central mountain range. To get there from Bogota, it takes more than 8 hours of travel on a bus. From Chaparral, Tolima, the highway is road is tough and unpaved. The trip contrasts the beauty of the mountains, with a long path that twists, steep walls full of coffee plantations and deep gulfs that flow into the Rio Amoyá.  El Cañón de Las Hermosas es una región rural de Colombia, está ubicado en Tolima, en lo más alto de la cordillera Central. Para  llegar allí desde Bogotá en bus son más de 8 horas de recorrido. Desde Chaparral, Tolima, la carretera es difícil, no está pavimentada. En el viaje contrastan la belleza de las montañas, con la vía estrecha que serpentea paredes empinadas llenas de cafetales, con profundos abismos que desembocan en el Río Amoyá.The area of San Jorge, in el Cañon de las Hermosas, is inhabited by mostly women farmers, from all ages. These women have suffered from the armed conflict first hand, as shown by the evident exclusion and stigmatization they experienced living in a zone where the guerilla were present. The enduring inequality has hindered the ability of these women and their families to enjoy their rights.La vereda San Jorge, en el Cañón de las Hermosas, está habitada en su mayoría por  mujeres agricultoras, de todas las edades. Ellas sufrieron en “carne propia” el conflicto armado, representado en la exclusión y la estigmatización por vivir en una zona donde estaba también la guerrilla. La inequidad permanente les impidió a las mujeres y a sus familias disfrutar de sus derechos.San Jorge is a territory of 45 families, all coffee growers, where human life is impressive. We befriend everyone, and we are always happily willing to have people. We have great biodiversity: birds, crops such as beans, corn, vegetables, fresh herbs; we have animals such as bees, chicken, and pigs. There are water sources and three thermal floors. We make arepas, and we eat ‘calentao’ for breakfast with grilled plantains and egg soup. We drink orange lemonade.San Jorge es un territorio que tiene 45 familias, todas cafeteras, donde la calidad humana es impresionante. Nosotros ofrecemos amistad, y siempre estamos dispuestos a recibir a las personas con mucha alegría. Tenemos gran biodiversidad: aves, cultivos como fríjoles, maíz, hortalizas, huerta casera; y animales como abejas, gallinas o cerdos. Aquí hay fuentes hídricas y tres pisos térmicos. Hacemos arepas y desayunamos “calentao” con maduro asado y caldo de huevo. Almorzamos sopa de plátanos y yuca, se sirve con arroz y carne con salsa de tomate y cebolla de la huerta. Tomamos limonada con naranja. I think the conflict affected us in different ways: I’ve had friends from the community die, we always lived in fear being in the crossfire between the guerrilla and the public forces. Sometimes, we thought that we were good one day and then another day weren’t sure if we were better off leaving. We suffer from strong stigmatization. The State never came to our communities. With the signing of peace, this changed. The community now has more confidence in the State. We see institutional mechanisms are present and we are envisioning projects.Yo creo que el conflicto nos afectó de diferentes maneras: hubo amigos de la comunidad muertos, vivíamos con temor y entre dos fuegos, el de la guerrilla y el de la fuerza pública. Pensábamos que un día estábamos bien y al otro día no sabíamos si irnos. Sufrimos estigmatización permanente. El Estado no llegaba a nuestras veredas. Ahora, con la firma de la paz, esto cambió. La comunidad ve que hay más confianza en el Estado, vemos que la institucionalidad hace presencia y estamos visualizando proyectos.Our Partners / Nuestros Aliados
During the conflict, we women felt like we were lagging behind. While the war went on, we had couldn’t even legalize a foundation. Now we have our own foundation of women and we started to have projects: one with laying hens that ISAGEN supports and another with small bee keepers. We produce honey. These are the things that we never thought we would be able to achieve.En el tiempo del conflicto nosotras las mujeres nos sentíamos rezagadas. Cuando lo duro de la guerra, nosotras no podíamos legalizar ni siquiera una fundación. Ahora ya tenemos nuestra fundación de mujeres y comenzamos a presentar proyectos: uno con gallinas ponedoras que ISAGEN  apoya, y el otro como pequeñas apicultoras, producimos miel. Estas son cosas que jamás pensamos que se lograrían.UN Human rights was the only organization that came to our communities during hard times of the conflict. They were the only ones that were able to get here. Every time they came, they were a sign of hope. They taught us how to recognize of the rights that we had, because before we didn’t know what our rights were. We thought that things were the way they were, until they explained that we are entitled to these rights. And they empowered us to know how to stand up to armed groups.ONU derechos Humanos fue la única entidad que entró a nuestras veredas en las épocas duras del conflicto. Ellos eran los únicos que podían llegar hasta aquí. Cada vez que llegaban eran la esperanza. Ellos nos enseñaron a tener conocimiento de los derechos que teníamos, porque nosotros antes no conocíamos los derechos. Nosotros pensábamos que las cosas eran como eran, hasta que ellos nos explicaron a qué teníamos derecho y nos empoderaron para saber pararnos al frente de los grupos armados.Now we see UN Human Rights and we see them as family. We have a lot of trust in them. We like seeing them and we’re always happy when they visit the community.Ahora vemos a ONU Derechos Humanos y sabemos que son como de nuestra casa. Hoy en día les tenemos mucha confianza. Para nosotros es muy satisfactorio verlos y tenemos mucha alegría cuando llegan a la vereda. Perks / Recompensas

<p>In 2012, we created a new category of game-changing pizza ovens. We’re proud that all our pizza ovens have received outstanding press and customer reviews since then.</p>
<p>We’ve packed our years of learning, research and innovation into this powerful, portable, kickass product. We’ve listened to our community of Ooni users all over the world, and what we know for sure is that people have a burning desire to cook with fire.</p>
<p>Inspired by our roots, ‘karu’ means ‘rugged’ in Finnish – Ooni Karu creates an honest, no-nonsense, primal cooking experience. We created this new pizza oven around the instinct to cook pared-back, flame-cooked food, combined with the innovation our products are known for.</p>

<p>Cook with real wood and charcoal, or both, with Ooni Karu. Designed for use with high-quality solid fuels, it becomes a roaring inferno so you can fire out epic pizza. Ready to start cooking in 15 minutes, Ooni Karu heats to 932°F, or 500°C, and cooks incredible pizza in just 60 seconds. Ooni Karu is also ideal for cooking wood-fired meat, fish and vegetable dishes.</p>
<p>The oven's extra thick stone baking board retains heat for longer, whilst the superior insulation means Ooni Karu holds onto more heat for an efficient burn and less fuel needed to reach those soaring temperatures. Ooni Karu is also compatible with the Ooni Gas Burner if you prefer to cook with propane. </p>

<p><strong>PORTABLE</strong></p>
<p>When we say portable, we really mean it. Carry Ooni Karu with you to any outdoor space – it weighs just over 26 pounds, or 12 kilos (that’s just about the same as a case of beer). To take it on the go or to store it away, simply fold up the legs and twist off the detachable chimney to stow it inside the oven body. </p>

We have far too many similar items in our kitchen & bathroom.

To preserve Nature, we must drastically reduce our production of single-use products & daily products. We have to reduce our mass production.
We need more durable products.
This is why we created Scrubbio: to replace all similar and single-use products with only a simple product, thereby considerably reducing our production.This product replaces many other products in your home and will decrease global production. You could also keep it and use it for years. Scrubbio is made with a recyclable & ultra-durable silicone.    We must reduce our production of products to save nature. We have to produce durable and recyclable items easily.                      So FUN!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Mark Bajek,</p>
<p>Occasional bicycle tourist.. I know what it's like to cycle alone for long distances and to get frustrated with the weather and traffic and heat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year I took the badger over to Manitowoc,WI on a overnight day trip and peddled around town, on the way back to MI I took the badger to Ludington, MI. I spent a week in Ludington riding around, it was such a bike freindly community (both towns are decent for cycling). Now I keep coming back on short 2-3 day mini cycling vacations to Ludington . ( I live in metro Detroit).</p>
<p>On the way back </p>
<p>I shared the boat eastbound with 2 guys from Washington state heading to Maine. Something many a cyclist dream of accomplishing but can't find the time or money.</p>
<p>Another guy was heading to Montreal from who knows where because he'd been cyclng for over 1 year so far. just meandering. He had not only panniers (saddlebags), but also a trailer, that's a lot of weight.  </p>
<p>None of these three cyclists seem to be enjoying the trip, none talked about how pretty the countryside was, or the nice people they met...nothing like that. They talked about the winds, the heat , the hills. One of the guys going to Maine was cycling with a replaced hip and in real need of rest and was in some decent pain . He was in his mid 60's..</p>
<p>It is after all a physical stamina test..coast to coast on a bicycle. You get sore, injured , hit by an RV you name it ...why we do it is beyond me sometimes. I guess it's an adventure cycling long distances across the US. Supported with someone else carrying all your stuff...probably isn't that hard, but carrying 50 pounds of gear over huge mountain passes and up steep hills is a challenge for sure.</p>
<p>Climbing 11, and 14, 000 feet summits inthe rockies 10 % grades in the appalacians   isn't a cakewalk.</p>
<p>But it all starts with the very first peddle stroke. One starts it with the intent of finishing it come hell or highwater. State after state, hill after hill, head wind after head wind, dismounting and peeing in the weeds, pooping in porta potties in city parks..</p>
<p>Or trying to get up a hill as a dog starts chasing you nipping at your ankles. Having mechanical issues in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>So I was thinking since Ludington is about the 2/3 to 1/2 way point across the country depending on the route you're taking, wouldn't it be nice to surprise these weary cyclists with a voucher for either an ice cream cone or maybe a breakfast if they so desired. If we could expand it even farther great. But let's start with something refreshing.</p>
<p>Nothing too extravagant just a Welcome to about the 1/2 way point of the trip.  It's all downhill from here have a scoop on us!   Just a nice freindly gesture for all the sore butts and sore legs crossing the US on bicycles and using the Badger to cut across lake Michigan.</p>
<p>It's big enough of a town to have the services they need, and small enough to be safe.</p>
<p>Give the the voucher in Wisconsin when they board the badger at Manitowoc and a voucher in Ludington if they are going west into Manitowoc for an ice cream store over there. ,allow them time to alter their plans, instead of just cycling off the Badger and cycling deep into Michigan or far into Wisconsin...let them rest their weary legs and lungs for a day or so. Fix their bike if they need to, visit a local doctor for the crotch rot issue or broken skin near the perineum or a sore hip.</p>
<p>Let them swim in Lake Michigan,grab a single scoop and maybe spend the night in a local campground or motel..and then have breakfast on you and me and then continue rested to points east. (like maine or Virginia). or west like Oregon and Washington State. It's still a long road to hoe. So let's get them to take in a sunset or a sunrise over a huge body of water instead of just cycling head down into the wind looking at nothing but a white stipe and missing a very pretty part of America.</p>
<p>A rested biker is after all a safer biker. And the sugar and fat in the ice cream isn't that bad for them.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I need as much money as I can muster to expand the program ,but 900 bucks should cover every cyclist coming over the lake both ways in 2013.(next ferry season)</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I'd like to purchase vouchers from the ice cream place in Ludington (house of flavors ) </p>
<p>House of Flavors (HOF) (the local ice cream joint also serves a tasty breakfast)</p>
<p>(Their strawberry jam is very nice)</p>
<p>They open at 7 AM and close around 10PM.. </p>
<p>So when a cyclist exits the morning ferry (the red eye) at 6 or so..after a 4 hour crossing on lake Michigan, they can cycle up the street and instead of turning right out of town they turn left toward the lake looking for the voucher place (HOF).</p>
<p>Or if they take the last ferry across the lake at 2 PM they arrive around 6 PM, have dinner someplace, then pop over to HOF for an ice cream cone.</p>
<p>Give them the opportunity to relax a bit, and consider maybe resting up in ludington before tackling the less pretty part of Michigan., slow them down instead of just non stop peddling (60,100 miles per day) just to get from coast to coast before summer is over.</p>
<p>Rest up, regroup, oil up your chain...sit on the beach , unclip from your peddles. Take a long potty break and lick your way silly. (or use a cup and a spoon if you wish).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">The economic</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;""> impact in Ludington and Manitowoc as a community is miniscule, only about 400 cyclist take the badger across the lake each way...and most cyclists are on a budget and don't have extra money to toss around on ice cream. But they do need to plan rest days some place or they'll get overtired and make very stupid decisions in traffic..</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">Even though the mental impact to a cyclist is pretty astonishing, a simple smile goes a long way and when you surprise them with an offer to buy em breakfast or an ice cream cone  it...goes a mile..</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">I was in ludington on a late August morning 8 AM  just cycling past stearns park after a ride up to the state park, and a loaded cyclist , cycling in the opposite direction from me was heading into the rest room at the beach( not locking his bike) , so I waiting for him to finish his business and I chatted him up. ( I also kept an eye on his bike while he was occupied).</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">He was from Oregon moving to Manhattan I think his name was paul.</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">I asked him if he took the badger across and he said ""yes"".</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">I asked him if he was going to be in town at least until noon?, </span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi, I'm Mark Bajek,
Occasional bicycle tourist.. I know what it's like to cycle alone for long distances and to get frustrated with the weather and traffic and heat.
 
This year I took the badger over to Manitowoc,WI on a overnight day trip and peddled around town, on the way back to MI I took the badger to Ludington, MI. I spent a week in Ludington riding around, it was such a bike freindly community (both towns are decent for cycling). Now I keep coming back on short 2-3 day mini cycling vacations to Ludington . ( I live in metro Detroit).
On the way back 
I shared the boat eastbound with 2 guys from Washington state heading to Maine. Something many a cyclist dream of accomplishing but can't find the time or money.
Another guy was heading to Montreal from who knows where because he'd been cyclng for over 1 year so far. just meandering. He had not only panniers (saddlebags), but also a trailer, that's a lot of weight.  
None of these three cyclists seem to be enjoying the trip, none talked about how pretty the countryside was, or the nice people they met...nothing like that. They talked about the winds, the heat , the hills. One of the guys going to Maine was cycling with a replaced hip and in real need of rest and was in some decent pain . He was in his mid 60's..
It is after all a physical stamina test..coast to coast on a bicycle. You get sore, injured , hit by an RV you name it ...why we do it is beyond me sometimes. I guess it's an adventure cycling long distances across the US. Supported with someone else carrying all your stuff...probably isn't that hard, but carrying 50 pounds of gear over huge mountain passes and up steep hills is a challenge for sure.
Climbing 11, and 14, 000 feet summits inthe rockies 10 % grades in the appalacians   isn't a cakewalk.
But it all starts with the very first peddle stroke. One starts it with the intent of finishing it come hell or highwater. State after state, hill after hill, head wind after head wind, dismounting and peeing in the weeds, pooping in porta potties in city parks..
Or trying to get up a hill as a dog starts chasing you nipping at your ankles. Having mechanical issues in the middle of nowhere.
So I was thinking since Ludington is about the 2/3 to 1/2 way point across the country depending on the route you're taking, wouldn't it be nice to surprise these weary cyclists with a voucher for either an ice cream cone or maybe a breakfast if they so desired. If we could expand it even farther great. But let's start with something refreshing.
Nothing too extravagant just a Welcome to about the 1/2 way point of the trip.  It's all downhill from here have a scoop on us!   Just a nice freindly gesture for all the sore butts and sore legs crossing the US on bicycles and using the Badger to cut across lake Michigan.
It's big enough of a town to have the services they need, and small enough to be safe.
Give the the voucher in Wisconsin when they board the badger at Manitowoc and a voucher in Ludington if they are going west into Manitowoc for an ice cream store over there. ,allow them time to alter their plans, instead of just cycling off the Badger and cycling deep into Michigan or far into Wisconsin...let them rest their weary legs and lungs for a day or so. Fix their bike if they need to, visit a local doctor for the crotch rot issue or broken skin near the perineum or a sore hip.
Let them swim in Lake Michigan,grab a single scoop and maybe spend the night in a local campground or motel..and then have breakfast on you and me and then continue rested to points east. (like maine or Virginia). or west like Oregon and Washington State. It's still a long road to hoe. So let's get them to take in a sunset or a sunrise over a huge body of water instead of just cycling head down into the wind looking at nothing but a white stipe and missing a very pretty part of America.
A rested biker is after all a safer biker. And the sugar and fat in the ice cream isn't that bad for them.
What We Need & What You Get:
I need as much money as I can muster to expand the program ,but 900 bucks should cover every cyclist coming over the lake both ways in 2013.(next ferry season)
 


I'd like to purchase vouchers from the ice cream place in Ludington (house of flavors ) 
House of Flavors (HOF) (the local ice cream joint also serves a tasty breakfast)
(Their strawberry jam is very nice)
They open at 7 AM and close around 10PM.. 
So when a cyclist exits the morning ferry (the red eye) at 6 or so..after a 4 hour crossing on lake Michigan, they can cycle up the street and instead of turning right out of town they turn left toward the lake looking for the voucher place (HOF).
Or if they take the last ferry across the lake at 2 PM they arrive around 6 PM, have dinner someplace, then pop over to HOF for an ice cream cone.
Give them the opportunity to relax a bit, and consider maybe resting up in ludington before tackling the less pretty part of Michigan., slow them down instead of just non stop peddling (60,100 miles per day) just to get from coast to coast before summer is over.
Rest up, regroup, oil up your chain...sit on the beach , unclip from your peddles. Take a long potty break and lick your way silly. (or use a cup and a spoon if you wish).
 


The Impact
The economic impact in Ludington and Manitowoc as a community is miniscule, only about 400 cyclist take the badger across the lake each way...and most cyclists are on a budget and don't have extra money to toss around on ice cream. But they do need to plan rest days some place or they'll get overtired and make very stupid decisions in traffic..
Even though the mental impact to a cyclist is pretty astonishing, a simple smile goes a long way and when you surprise them with an offer to buy em breakfast or an ice cream cone  it...goes a mile..
I was in ludington on a late August morning 8 AM  just cycling past stearns park after a ride up to the state park, and a loaded cyclist , cycling in the opposite direction from me was heading into the rest room at the beach( not locking his bike) , so I waiting for him to finish his business and I chatted him up. ( I also kept an eye on his bike while he was occupied).
He was from Oregon moving to Manhattan I think his name was paul.
I asked him if he took the badger across and he said ""yes"".
I asked him if he was going to be in town at least until noon?, 
He said he was sort of thinking of using Ludington as a rest day. Spending the night in town.  That's the plan , use Ludington to rest up.
I asked him if the folks on the badger gave him a voucher for Ice cream?.
He said ""no"",  I said ""we'll they should have , we're rewarding cross country cyclists when they hit ludington with an ice cream so they'll take a few minutes and rest up before cycling east.""
So I reached into my pocket and handed him $3.00 but as I was doing that and talking to him, a Canadian Toonie dropped out of my pocket onto the pavement. ( I just came back from French toast island (St.joe)).
Paul was a bit surprised at the Idea, that a total stranger (fellow cyclist in this case) would give him money for anything let alone ice cream...just out of the blue like that.. It seemed to make him happy he cycled into Ludington,Michigan instead of taking US 2 in the upper peninsula.
  He also told me that someone from the Ludington Daily News took his picture and they might publish it in the paper.
Lucky day for him, Ice cream and a few minutes of fame.  
I asked the route he was taking to NY and he said he was cutting through Canada on the Lake erie connector route.
So I picked up that $2 coin and handed it to him and said ""here this is for you as well have a safe ride through Canada.""
He said thanks and smilingly we shook hands and  we both cycled in our separate directions. I was heading to Detroit (by car)  it looked like he was heading up to the city campground or the state park.
I'm sure he thought I was some kind of ""Kook"" just handing out money like that....but it was just my way of rewarding that sort of effort...and experimenting with the idea of using both towns as rest stops.
It's not just the physical part, but the mental part, long days on the road all alone, peddle stroke after peddle stroke , mile after mile, hill after hill..looking down at the side of the road, while people whiz past , some giving you lots of room, others cliping you with their passenger side mirror.  I can really wear on a cyclist.
So yeah , I think it would be nice to reward them with an ice cream cone at the half way point!  both towns are pretty safe to ride in, and seemed safe from a theft standpoint. (not that I'd leave my ride unlocked even in Ludington).
Other Ways You Can Help


Perhaps you could contact the local CVBs and push this idea.
both of em, Manitowoc for westbound and Ludington for east bound cyclists using the badger. 
Let's welcome them to both sides of this wonderful great lake.
I've contacted both and neither seem to want to respond to my email.
The ice cream owner in Ludington thought it was a good idea (he being a fellow cyclist). So I'm sure the vouchers will get to the badger to be handed out.
No contact from the folks at the Badger or the ice cream joint in Manitowoc.
Thanks for your time

<p><strong>1. Extraordinary cutting ability.</strong> The thinner the knife, the better it cuts. But for an extremely thin blade that holds up, the steel must be extremely tough with great dimensional stability—to prevent the thin edge from rolling or dulling under pressure.</p>
</div></div></div></div></div></figure></div><p><strong>2. Fantastic edge retention. </strong>Our knife edge stays sharp longer thanks to several factors: alloy composition (we use 3% Vanadium—which forms some of the hardest carbides), Rockwell hardness (RC), and the ability to resist various impacts. Elmax Super Steel, at 60-62RC (Rockwell hardness), has better edge retention than top-of-the-line Japanese powder steel SG-2 at 63-64RC.</p><p><strong>3- Superb toughness. </strong>We’ve all accidentally hacked through a bone, or scraped our knives against a ceramic plate. Good news: the 3rd generation powder metallurgy behind our knives leads to higher resistance to chipping and other edge damage—which means they can handle the inevitable mistake in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>4. Corrosion Resistance.</strong> Based on our surveys, the vast majority of knife users don't immediately wash and dry their knives every time—and neglecting this step can make even the best knife rust or dull faster. We could wag our fingers in your face and give you a hearty tsk tsk—but we decided to make corrosion resistance of paramount importance in our design.

Ergonomics.</strong> A knife should have a sharp edge in only one place: the cutting edge. There is no reason for a heel or bolster to be sharp. There's no reason for a spine not to be rounded off. These little details matter for home cooks and professional chefs who cook for extended periods of time, because they minimize blisters and hot spots. A knife should also be comfortable for large and small hands alike.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556640305/qwksdspziauxu2rm9tgn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>7. Sustainability. </strong>Our steel begins in an electric arc furnace, which consumes 9 times less energy than the blast furnaces used for most steel. Fossil fuels make up only 1% of Sweden's overall energy consumption; compare that with Japan, where fossil fuels make up 82% of overall consumption—and where 100% of all steel is made through a blast furnace. By choosing a quality steel from Sweden, we can see a whopping 738x reduction in fossil fuel emissions associated with the production of our steel.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/artisan-revere-chef-knife-made-with-industrial-super-steel/payments/new?perk_id=4765796"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556766365/xxjwntpcynqpe9si30bf.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556750425/nnuvv5b3ydcnmrhpsz9m.png"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""24463305""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1555453358/f0edschjekncgaopsiae.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>Elmax, a 3rd generation Swedish powder steel produced by Bohler-Uddeholm, is made with the latest and greatest in powder metallurgy technology.

<p><strong>Let’s talk alloy content: </strong>Carbon increases steel performance by making it harder and stronger—and at 1.7% carbon, Elmax has three times more than Germany’s most popular knife steel (X50CrMoV15), and 60% more than Japan’s most popular knife steel (VG-10). Elmax’s alloy content also contains 3% vanadium—fifteen times that of German and Japanese steels. The result? A durable steel that will stay sharp, longer.</p>
<p>This is a complete game-changer—because most knife brands out there haven’t figured out how to master both toughness <strong>and</strong> edge retention. Think about those ultra-thin Japanese kitchen knives, that cut like magic but chip and dull with every movement. Or those “premium” German blades that stay tough, but cut like glorified butter knives. Here's what our knife looks like:</p>

He found that even many of the most expensive options were made with low-quality steel, manufactured to meet a bare-minimum standard.Chances are, you've experienced this already, with knives that either dull too fast, or chip too easily. It’s a familiar situation, whether you’re an avid home cook or a professional chef. Think back to it: You've been cooking for hours. Your Japanese blade chipped—again. Your heavy German “workhorse” of a knife is smashing your delicate ingredients into smithereens. Your hands are getting calloused from the rough edges on your knife, and your wrist hurts from a less-than-ideal grip. We did the research, collaborating with renowned chefs, top bladesmiths, artisans, and metallurgists to create a kitchen knife unlike any other. And we opted for Elmax® Super Steel, the same steel used in knives carried by avid outdoorsmen and U.S. Special Forces soldiers.The result? An incredibly sharp, thin, and tough knife—the best of cutting-edge technology, ergonomic design, and old-school craftsmanship. A knife that cuts quickly and easily through any ingredient. A knife that stays sharp 2.3x longer than Wusthof, and 1.9x longer than Global, Shun, and 3.3x longer than Dalstrong.With our knife, you can cut through rock-hard squash without breaking a sweat. Transform a ripe tomato into crisp, even slices, without smashing it all over your cutting board. Slice through beautiful cuts of meat, without the tedious back-and-forth of a dull knife. Leave kitchen hack jobs behind—and experience the Artisan Revere edge.  
Thanks to wear-resistant and chip-resistant Elmax® Super Steel, we’ve created a powerful kitchen knife that’s unlike anything else out there in the market. Our thin, strong, and ultra-sharp blade slices quickly and easily through any food—and stays sharp drastically longer than the standard kitchen knife. Think less time spent sweating over your prep work, and more time truly savoring the fruits of your labor.This is a 3rd generation powder steel that’s normally reserved for industrial use, and for everyday carry and tactical knives used by avid outdoorsmen and U.S. Special Forces soldiers.  

Simply put, our knives make cooking easy and effortless. But there’s a ton of complex, behind-the-scenes science that’s forged into every knife, from handle to spine to tip.
Artisan Revere’s mission is to create the world’s best blades. Our knives meet the highest standards for seven factors: cutting ability, edge retention, toughness, corrosion resistance, balance, ergonomics, and sustainability.


 
1. Extraordinary cutting ability. The thinner the knife, the better it cuts. But for an extremely thin blade that holds up, the steel must be extremely tough with great dimensional stability—to prevent the thin edge from rolling or dulling under pressure.
2. Fantastic edge retention. Our knife edge stays sharp longer thanks to several factors: alloy composition (we use 3% Vanadium—which forms some of the hardest carbides), Rockwell hardness (RC), and the ability to resist various impacts. Elmax Super Steel, at 60-62RC (Rockwell hardness), has better edge retention than top-of-the-line Japanese powder steel SG-2 at 63-64RC.3- Superb toughness. We’ve all accidentally hacked through a bone, or scraped our knives against a ceramic plate. Good news: the 3rd generation powder metallurgy behind our knives leads to higher resistance to chipping and other edge damage—which means they can handle the inevitable mistake in the kitchen.4. Corrosion Resistance. Based on our surveys, the vast majority of knife users don't immediately wash and dry their knives every time—and neglecting this step can make even the best knife rust or dull faster. We could wag our fingers in your face and give you a hearty tsk tsk—but we decided to make corrosion resistance of paramount importance in our design. By all means, treat your knife with care, but rest easy knowing that our knife can handle the occasional slip-up.5. Balance. A chef knife should be balanced just in front of the handle, to provide a good mix of power and precision.This takes plenty of time and skill to perfect. To achieve the perfect balance, we not only skeletonized the tang (the steel under the handle); we also skeletonized the handle.6. Ergonomics. A knife should have a sharp edge in only one place: the cutting edge. There is no reason for a heel or bolster to be sharp. There's no reason for a spine not to be rounded off. These little details matter for home cooks and professional chefs who cook for extended periods of time, because they minimize blisters and hot spots. A knife should also be comfortable for large and small hands alike.7. Sustainability. Our steel begins in an electric arc furnace, which consumes 9 times less energy than the blast furnaces used for most steel. Fossil fuels make up only 1% of Sweden's overall energy consumption; compare that with Japan, where fossil fuels make up 82% of overall consumption—and where 100% of all steel is made through a blast furnace. By choosing a quality steel from Sweden, we can see a whopping 738x reduction in fossil fuel emissions associated with the production of our steel.  Elmax, a 3rd generation Swedish powder steel produced by Bohler-Uddeholm, is made with the latest and greatest in powder metallurgy technology. Not only is it about 60% tougher than America's top-of-the-line powder knife steel, and 240% tougher than one of the best non-powder steels; it also provides the double benefit of lower CO2 emissions and improved sustainability. In other words: this stuff is the best steel that we—and anyone else, really—can get our hands on.We could talk for days about powder metallurgy (PM), but we’ll give you the quick-and-dirty rundown. (A visual summary is below.) Powder metallurgy was invented to create high alloy tool steels with superior toughness and wear resistance. We’re talking shock resistance and edge retention, for industrial tools that last longer, perform better, and require less repair.Uddeholm's Full Particle Metallurgy Production Process
 Uddeholm's PM Process  When we say we’ve thought of everything, we mean it. From the shape of our blade to the taper of our edge, every element has been specially engineered to make your cooking experience effortless and enjoyable.
 
 

  


 
 


 
 


 

 
We know the kitchen can be a whirlwind of elements—from brining liquids to stovetop flames. So we’ve designed our handles to be as resilient as possible, to last through even the busiest kitchen environments. More reasons to feel good about your perfectly prepped food: The extremely durable materials we use in our handles are Rainforest Alliance Certified™, FSC certified, and GREENGUARD certified. We get our hands on the best materials we can find, with an eye toward sustainability. 


Our Limited Edition: WorkSharp x Artisan Revere E5 comes with:

A Master Belt Kit that includes one coarse, two medium, one fine, and one extra fine grit belt for all of your sharpening needs.
A 15 degree per side angle guide installed, so you get that same great, factory-sharp edge.  
A 17 degree per side angle guide included, to bring your Western knives to a factory-sharp edge.



 
It all starts with Bohler-Uddeholm, the Austrian-Swedish purveyor of Elmax Super Steel—what we know to be the world's best kitchen knife steel.   Our powder steel heads to the United States, where Chris supervises the waterjet cut process to maximize the steel's integrity and guarantee no Heat Affected Zones (HAZ).
Brad then takes our steel through precise heat treatments, followed by deep cryogenic treatments to perfect the hardness of our knives. Once set, John Jr. ensures our knives are bevel ground and surface-ground to within one thousandth of an inch. For comparison, standard printer paper is three thousandths of an inch. (How's that for precision?)
 

To create the profile of our knife handles, we use computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling, which allows for drilling and cutting across multiple axes. 
 


Dakota then epoxies and pins our lightweight handles to the tang of the blades (the steel portion of the blade that sits under the handle). He then clamps the handles together for the epoxy to settle. 
 
Once our handles are set, Eric grinds the bevels and smooths the handles—all so that our knife feels like a natural extension of your hand.
 


We then grind on the primary edge.
  
And finish every blade via a rapid buff.
 



  
And finally, a thorough stropping on Chromium Oxide-loaded leather to refine the incredibly sharp edge.

 

We put every single knife through numerous quality control tests to ensure each knife is truly our best work. Slicing paper makes for a fun test of the cutting edge.
 
 
 

 

Our knives are well-traveled. Here are the key destinations, from our New York office to your kitchen. 

 


Edge geometry = 50/50 bevel
Cutting edge is 15 degrees, ground on slack platen for a bit of a compound bevel
.010"" behind the edge
.090"" spine, with distal taper
8.6"" blade
2.05” tall at heel
13.6"" OAL
165 grams +/- 3 grams
Handles made from Richlite with G10 liners
Rounded spine and rounded heel area to ensure no blisters or hot spots

Let’s talk alloy content: Carbon increases steel performance by making it harder and stronger—and at 1.7% carbon, Elmax has three times more than Germany’s most popular knife steel (X50CrMoV15), and 60% more than Japan’s most popular knife steel (VG-10). Elmax’s alloy content also contains 3% vanadium—fifteen times that of German and Japanese steels. The result? A durable steel that will stay sharp, longer.
This is a complete game-changer—because most knife brands out there haven’t figured out how to master both toughness and edge retention. Think about those ultra-thin Japanese kitchen knives, that cut like magic but chip and dull with every movement. Or those “premium” German blades that stay tough, but cut like glorified butter knives. Here's what our knife looks like:







Every good knife needs a bit of protection from the elements. Our sophisticated 10 oz. English Bridle leather sheaths aren’t just for show; they protect your Super Steel knives, and are made from a smooth, flexible, and durable leather used in everything from classic equestrian gear to high-end leather goods.
Our leather comes from famed tannery Wickett & Craig, and our sheaths fit most chef knives up to 2.125″ tall. They are crafted by the same talented artisans responsible for your new Elmax Super Steel chef knife. You may choose from any of the following colors (top to bottom as seen in the bottom image with four sheaths):

Mahogany
Black
Medium Brown
Chestnut

Most of the time you will NOT be able to recognize the SAME wine at DIFFERENT temperatures. And temperature is the single biggest determinant of TASTE. The ""grapes"" and ""terroirs"" are crucial in determining the ideal serving temperature. Due to ever mounting room temperatures, the situation for red wines is particularly problematic as most reds are drunk up to 15°F too warm , basically ruining the wine from the start.  COOL... OR CHILLTo allow proper cooling we have created a unique airflow system in the top end of the Cooler. There is a smaller fan that blows the cold air via the coldsink onto the rubbers which allow the air to flow down and cool the bottle everywhere at the same temperature. The Qool Booster makes sure that the cold airflow does not escape. AUTOMATIC OR MANUALThe standard configuration is designed to allow the app to control the cooler via a Wifi connection. We included the option of manually adjusting the QelviQ to your own taste via the app or via the Cooler itself by simply adjusting it via the touchpads “plus” and “minus”.CHARGING STATION OR PORTABLE BATTERYThe basic configuration includes a 120 watt power station that is able to provide power to the Cooler and is able to load the Lithium Ion Battery. The battery itself is ideal for chilling the wine at the same temperature as this consumes much less energy which allows the battery up to 1.5 hours of autonomy.SUPER FAST OR ULTRA SILENT Thanks to its 120 power engine and the very fast dissipation of the heat via the Scythe heatsink, we were able to deliver the fastest cooler on earth (+3°F/1.6°C per 10 min measured in the bottle!) which uses Peltier technology without ice or water!When you only want to chill the wine, the heatsink and the ultra low noise fan combined, enable a super silent experience.+5 MOREACCURATE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT thanks to our temperature algorithm

This covers more than 95% of the global market.PERSONAL INVENTORYThe QelviQ app allows you to easily track the number of bottles you have of each wine and allows you to archive wines you might not have in stock but don’t want to forget about for future purchases.24/7 SOMMELIER SERVICEIn addition we provide a free service that enables you to send us a message asking for the right serving temperature of any particular wine, just in case the app wasn’t able to retrieve it.+6 MOREADAPT TO YOUR TASTE (via the app  instead of the cooler)CONTROL THE SOUND LEVEL(between super fast and ultra silent)

 Sommeliers and Wine Connoisseurs ...and Wine Lovers and Wine enthousiasts  Fast Peltier Cooling The Cooler cools the wine on average 3°F or 1,6°C every 10 minutes without using ice, water or moving the bottle. It is the fastest wine cooler in the world that also respects the liquid thanks to the Qool Booster, the high performance copper heatsink, a customized aluminium coldsink in the top of the cooler, the compact space and the two ultra low noise fans.Ultra Low Noise Chilling The Cooler only uses 17 watt in this mode to power the Peltier and the two low noise fans and still keep the wine at the right temperature. This enables the cooler to operate without producing noise.Portable Battery Configuration All other coolers are using a charging station to cool and have no option for putting the bottle on the table. Thanks to the battery, this is now possible, for indoor and outdoor usage. Accurate Temperature Measurement QelviQ Smart Wine Coolers uses an algorithm to get an accurate estimate of the temperature inside the bottle. It then calculates the power necessary to ensure the liquid in the bottle is cooled at the ideal serving temperature. There is no other wine cooler in the world that uses this accurate approach.Database of Ideal Serving Temperatures Currently there are more than 80.000 winemakers covering 1400 regions or “terroirs” and over 500+ grapes in our database.

<p>Power Practical Co-Founder, David, started working on the Jul in the summer of 2015.  Initially, the idea was to create a coffee cup powered through wireless induction, similar to how cell phones and toothbrushes wirelessly charge.  After extensive testing, however, we made the decision to switch to pin connectors.  Due to efficiency losses, the power just isn’t there to maintain 150°F indefinitely using wireless USB charging.

<p>We’ve gone through many iterations of all the features of the Jul. Multiple 3D prints were made, revised, redrawn, reprinted, and the process repeated to finely tune all the details. We’ve recorded hundreds of hours of temperature data, with tests ranging from 30 minutes to 96 hours. To test the temperature control and LED display we used an arduino and tried out different methods of heating until we were satisfied with the temperature stability.  We are now ready to take all this prototyping to full production and begin manufacturing the Jül.</p>

We developed a car coaster that fits into most standard cup holders and is powered by USB which can plug into your car's USB port or the included auto cigarette lighter adapter. Whether you’re commuting to work, adventuring around in your van, or spending your workday in and out of your car, you don’t need to live with lukewarm coffee any longer.  






You shouldn’t need an app or WiFi connection to have a great cup of coffee. With the Jül, all you need is a USB port to keep the coaster powered and a smooth turn of the base to control the temperature. No apps, no in-your-face digital screens and no WiFi required; the Jül keeps things simple and easy.
 





 





 





 





 





 





At Power Practical, we’re constantly brainstorming new product ideas. An integral part of our process is coffee consumption. We drink it for pleasure, we drink it for energy, we drink it to keep our minds sharp. If there’s one thing that chaps our khakis, it’s missing those few opportunities to drink our coffee at the perfect temperature. 





There is so much calculated effort in turning a raw unprocessed coffee bean into the delicious beverage that we enjoy on the daily. Controlling temperature is essential in both the roasting and brewing process, yet once we get to drinking our coffee, temperature control is lost and neglected.





Power Practical Co-Founder, David, started working on the Jul in the summer of 2015.  Initially, the idea was to create a coffee cup powered through wireless induction, similar to how cell phones and toothbrushes wirelessly charge.  After extensive testing, however, we made the decision to switch to pin connectors.  Due to efficiency losses, the power just isn’t there to maintain 150°F indefinitely using wireless USB charging.

 





We’ve gone through many iterations of all the features of the Jul. Multiple 3D prints were made, revised, redrawn, reprinted, and the process repeated to finely tune all the details. We’ve recorded hundreds of hours of temperature data, with tests ranging from 30 minutes to 96 hours. To test the temperature control and LED display we used an arduino and tried out different methods of heating until we were satisfied with the temperature stability.  We are now ready to take all this prototyping to full production and begin manufacturing the Jül.",27.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong>What is Mead?</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Mead</i></strong><i>: An alcoholic drink where the main fermentable is honey.</i></p>
<p>Mead is a versatile drink. Like wine, it can range from dry, semi-sweet, to sweet. Also, like varieties of grapes in wine, the honey used in mead can bring many different characteristics depending on what type of flowers the bees are visiting.</p>
<p><strong>What is Sonhadora Meadery</strong></p>
<p><i>Sonhadora</i> is a Portuguese word meaning “Daydreamer” or “Stargazer”</p>
<p>This is part of our core values. Our mead is not just a drink: it’s something to help inspire. We want our meadery to be there to encourage community to come together &amp; dream together.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Sonhadora Meadery</strong></p>
<p>We’re doing this!</p>
<p>Thank you to all our friends and family over the past years that we have shared our meads with and let us pontificate to them on this dream. It is now time to make our meadery a reality and share our meads new friends, starting here!</p>
<p>Our names are Ron and Jenna Andrade and we are the owners of Sonhadora Meadery.</p>
<p>It has been our dream to be entrepreneurs, but have never made the connection to the right idea to put passion behind... until now.</p>
<p>We want to open a meadery, not just to share our irresistible meads, but use it as a vessel to create community. Our happiness is to hear your stories about sitting around the table with friends and family for an unforgettable night of community and joy and have a bottle of our mead at that table to share.</p>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to you in helping make this a reality.</p>
<p><strong>What Will the Funding Go Toward?</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised will go towards bringing Sonhadora meads to market.</p>
<p>We will be starting with production in a 1100sq foot building without a tasting room. This allows us a low cost way to get started while licensing and production begin. A tasting room is the goal, but that is a zoning issue and we are working with the local gov. to figure that out, so it is distribution only at the start. Licensing is a bit tricky with alcoholic beverages, so our first hurdle is to get our production area ready quickly, so we can start the licensing process. We have already begun to work with local government and an architect to get the details right to keep that time-frame as short as possible.</p>
<p>So our main goal with this campaign is to open a production facility:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a location, but utilities need to be brought up to code.</li>
<li>We need to purchase the fermenters and brewing supplies.</li>
<li>We need the honey, yeast, and ingredients to start those first batches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>All of these things will allow us to begin production and make the step toward our ultimate goal of opening a tasting room so we can give the personal experience of our meads directly to you.</p>
<p>As we build up to that, we will begin to distribute locally and expand outward as the distribution list grows. We will also begin online sales in Michigan and further, but will be dependent on what states allow ""out-of-state"" wine sales.  </p>
<p>Also, you'll be supporting a small business startup that will eventually employ others in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>As they say, time is our enemy. We want to take advantage of a quickly growing industry and want to get our product to market by mid 2019. To accomplish this, many legal hurdles have to be crossed because this is an alcoholic drink.</p>
<p>But we are building strong relationships with our community and our support grows day by day.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<li>We are asking folks to get the word out and make some buzz about our campaign.</li>

<h3>The Journey</h3>
<p>Kamonegi, founded by Chef Mutsuko Soma. started as a series of pop-ups along the west coast, but having a restaurant has always been a goal for Soma, who worked as a chef in many Seattle restaurants before returning to Japan to study soba making. There, she learned that Washington state was among the highest producers of buckwheat in the U.S. and made the decision to bring and promote the art of soba making to the United States, specifically Seattle.</p>
<p>The name Kamonegi refers to a harmonious culinary pairing of duck and leek, or more specifically, a duck bringing you a leek which symbolizes the good luck of one good thing that brings another.</p>
<p>Kamonegi the restaurant will continue to focus on handmade soba along with craft tempura, two classic dishes born out of Japan's Edo period. Your support of our campaign will help bring two currently underrepresented facets of Japanese cuisine to the Pacific Northwest and support a small neighborhood restaurant with wholesome food and a family friendly atmosphere. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498512295/delh4x5apvmlntvxirni.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help: </h3>
<p>The newspapers are on the window and there's magic happenin', but we're a few small details away from opening our doors: </p>
<ul>
<li>We're currently operating with a small crew, made up of a tight-knit group of employees we like to call our ""soba crew"". Your contribution will allow us to hire one or two extra servers and a cook to support our team upon opening. </li>
<li>Small details: We want your Kamonegi experience to transport you to a small neighborhood restaurant in Japan. Our windows will utilize shoji screens, made locally by a Japanese artist and we'll incorporate art, plate ware, and other accents to enhance your experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Every Little Bit Helps</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Beauty is in the details and we aim to use any amount we receive big or small to add thoughtfulness to our service and increase efficiency in our kitchen. Often running smaller restaurants require us to start small while dreaming big. Your contribution will help us get a little closer towards our goal of providing Seattle with a unique, can't-miss experience. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498512753/glx0wcetibdpgwpdduxk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Running a restaurant is risky, rent will go up, and the challenges are formidable, but we believe that Seattle will benefit from the unique experience we're determined to provide! We have, through our pop-ups and private dinners, laid the groundwork for soba and tenpura to make its mark on the local food scene and we will open the restaurant with a core group of staff that have remained passionate about our vision for the last five years. </p>
</div><div>

Kamonegi, founded by Chef Mutsuko Soma. started as a series of pop-ups along the west coast, but having a restaurant has always been a goal for Soma, who worked as a chef in many Seattle restaurants before returning to Japan to study soba making. There, she learned that Washington state was among the highest producers of buckwheat in the U.S. and made the decision to bring and promote the art of soba making to the United States, specifically Seattle.
The name Kamonegi refers to a harmonious culinary pairing of duck and leek, or more specifically, a duck bringing you a leek which symbolizes the good luck of one good thing that brings another.
Kamonegi the restaurant will continue to focus on handmade soba along with craft tempura, two classic dishes born out of Japan's Edo period. Your support of our campaign will help bring two currently underrepresented facets of Japanese cuisine to the Pacific Northwest and support a small neighborhood restaurant with wholesome food and a family friendly atmosphere. 


How you can help: 
The newspapers are on the window and there's magic happenin', but we're a few small details away from opening our doors: 

We're currently operating with a small crew, made up of a tight-knit group of employees we like to call our ""soba crew"". Your contribution will allow us to hire one or two extra servers and a cook to support our team upon opening. 
Small details: We want your Kamonegi experience to transport you to a small neighborhood restaurant in Japan. Our windows will utilize shoji screens, made locally by a Japanese artist and we'll incorporate art, plate ware, and other accents to enhance your experience.

Every Little Bit Helps

Beauty is in the details and we aim to use any amount we receive big or small to add thoughtfulness to our service and increase efficiency in our kitchen. Often running smaller restaurants require us to start small while dreaming big. Your contribution will help us get a little closer towards our goal of providing Seattle with a unique, can't-miss experience. 


Risks & Challenges
Running a restaurant is risky, rent will go up, and the challenges are formidable, but we believe that Seattle will benefit from the unique experience we're determined to provide! We have, through our pop-ups and private dinners, laid the groundwork for soba and tenpura to make its mark on the local food scene and we will open the restaurant with a core group of staff that have remained passionate about our vision for the last five years. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Kamonegi would not have gotten this far without your support. If you love soba, but cannot offer a donation, please support us by:

Sharing our campaign and project with your friends and loved ones through social media and other channels
Keep up with our progress and save the date. Bring your friends, families, and loved ones to dinner and enjoy the fruits of our labor!
Request us for a private dinner party or soba-making demonstration to share with family and friends! 

Thank you so much for your help and support!

<p><strong>The next step in mug evolution...</strong></p>
<p>Born out of disappointment with current offerings, we decided to design the next step in mug evolution. This is the only naturally sourced, porcelain ceramic self-warming mug on the market - eco-friendly and very durable.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388108/lh37uofxbuardswmjp9f.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The KOPI Mug is a two part system, featuring the mug itself and a heating coaster that doubles as a top-of-the-line wireless cellphone charger. </p>
<p>The mug itself is strong: crafted out of high quality ceramic and hand fired by skilled artisans, the KOPI Mug has been exactingly designed to guarantee a long future of usage.</p>
<p>Every mug comes with a lid included, designed to fit snug on the top of the mug and help it retain its internal temperature. </p>
<p><strong>No more cold coffee...</strong></p>
<p>Through the aid of electromagnetic energy, inlaid metallic particles within the base of the mug heats up. Thanks to this process, your drink will stay warm for a much longer amount of time than with traditional mugs, retaining its heat and maintaining enjoyable quality of your beverage.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388153/juaf5ke5q8mr44rqcp3v.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Keeps your coffee/tea at the perfect drinking temperature</strong></p>
<p>The key aspect of an enjoyable coffee or tea drinking experience is the prolonged warmth of the drink itself. Scientifically speaking, the optimal temperature which to enjoy hot beverages is 130°F/54°C. The KOPI Mug is designed to maintain this average temperature for a prolonged period of time, allowing the flavor and freshness of the drink to be preserved. Included with every mug, the lid also helps to ensure maximized warmth for the longest time possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heating Performance Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Performed in room temperature 68°F/20°C for four hours, both with and without the lid. Demonstrates the capacity for the mug/coaster combo to keep your drink at or above an enjoyable temperature (120°F/49°C) for at least four hours.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388201/auwyzj4lnrsxn3dff7f8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>On Porcelain Ceramic:</strong></p>
<p>With a well managed, heat-efficient kiln using non-toxic materials, there are few materials in the world that can match the durability and eco-friendliness of ceramic. Not only this, but ceramic offers unlimited variety in molding shape and form - in other words, ceramic offers us to perfectly fine tune the mug design to be the most ergonomic option available.</p>
<p>Not only is porcelain more dense than basic ceramic, but due to its through-body composition, it is considered more durable and better suited for heavy usage than basic ceramic. Because of this higher density, porcelain is less porous and therefore more suited to handling liquids, especially hot ones. </p>
<p><strong>Color Options:</strong></p>
<p>The mug is currently offered in white, black, and gray. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388222/ig4ovt6tu3t0qzwdl9o4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Not only does it heat your mug, it also charges your phone</strong></p>
<p>While the heating coaster provides the function of warming the mug, it offers another utilitarian purpose: wireless cellphone charger.</p>
<p>In designing the charging base, we knew it needed to have multiple functions: anything that goes on your desk or countertop needs to be worth the space it takes up. Because of this line of thinking, we decided to not only ensure quality mug-warming capabilities, but add the included functional versatility of a wireless phone charger. </p>
<p>Since the unit does not actually heat up, rather providing an electric charge to heat the inlaid materials within the mug, it will remain cool to the touch, allowing your phone to be place on top without risk of damage. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388245/ztxnuedghunnlegmbayy.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Sleek and stylish</strong></p>
<p>The charger unit, while a wholly functional piece of technology, looks absolutely gorgeous. Offered in both white and black, it offers a modern aesthetic touch to any space, whether in the office or at home. It's footprint is minimal, only 8mm thick, meaning it won't take up a lot of room and can be transported easily. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388300/lifkbwzvgkmf3ty2cdso.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Boasting an extremely solid CNC machined aluminum body with anodized color as well as a strong tempered glass surface, the charger is built to last. With a water resistant design, this unit will never become susceptible to the occasional spill. Also included in the design, the LED indicator lights offer activation confirmation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388311/xbgi4l49nrz7sn2uzsmk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Qi wireless charging technology</strong></p>
<p>Qi wireless technology uses electromagnetic induction to provide the fastest available wireless charge for all modern smartphones. State-of-the-art coils allow for flawless connection, every time. </p>
<p>Even without the ability to heat the KOPI Mug, the charging base is among the best wireless chargers available on the market today. Quality materials, attentive design, and solid technology  blend together to create this fantastic device.</p>
<p>This charger has been specifically designed to be compatible with the mug - no other charger can guarantee the same results capable with our optimized version. </p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388338/xpcmffj9ol8x3y2dd2ea.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Because the inlaid metallic particles within the mug are the only things reacting to the wireless power, the charger itself does not actually get hot (there are no heating coils) and, therefore, reduces the risk of being burned. Safety is of our outmost concern, and the KOPI Mug has been rigorously designed to meet our standards.</p>
<p><strong>Color Options:</strong></p>
<p>Currently offered in both White Glass/Light Gray Aluminum and Black Glass/Dark Gray Aluminum.</p>

<p>The KOPI Mug comes with all the tools you need for a perfect cup of your favorite hot beverage - i.e. glass pitcher, titanium stirrer, reusable coffee/tea filters and an air tight canister to keep everything fresh. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388473/w06wklaaehlgfuklsomu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Make your own gourmet coffee and save money</strong></p>
<p>Experts and aficionados agree that brewing with the “pour-over” method produces the best possible cup of coffee or tea - this process helps to emphasize natural oils and flavors, bringing out the full potential of every cup. Our titanium filters offer the ideal vehicle to use during this brewing procedure. </p>
<p>Needless to say, you’ll never need to use another disposable filter again. Easily washable, compact, and extremely strong, these filters will last for years to come.   </p>
<p>Offered in both coffee and tea varieties, each is specially crafted to perfect each individual style of brewing (drip coffee method vs. steep tea method). While coffee benefits from the slow drip method, exposing the infused coffee for a short period of time to decrease potential bitterness, tea tastes best when steeped for a longer interval. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388505/qdidgchtsbyl6ild4n23.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The filters are made out of high-quality (316) stainless steel, coated with a layer of resilient titanium. They feature laser cut, micro filtration technology: a double layer mesh ensures that nothing but the pure brewed liquid makes it through without clogging. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388523/zrfunnp1h2mpmbd4ghxb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Need hot water? Simply Microwave it!</strong></p>
<p>Preparing the water for the brew process is as easy as filling the pitcher, popping it into the microwave, and, depending on the strength of your microwave, heating it for three minutes (until the water is about to boil - roughly 200°F/93°C). From there, start brewing! </p>
<p><strong>The exact amount of water...</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to brewing coffee and tea, many elements of the process require scientific rigor and attention to detail: none more so than the proper ratio of liquid to coffee/tea. In order to simplify the process of measuring out the right amount of water for the KOPI Mug, we are offering a top-of-the-line pitcher with both coffee and tea fill-lines. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388547/woubmfgkq2yae56c8po1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By crafting the pitcher out of thick, heat-resistant and non-porous Borosilicate glass, we ensure that the glass itself will remain in pristine condition instead of absorbing residues and odors over time.  </p>
<p>Compact, lightweight, extra-strong: this pitcher adds another necessary tool to your brewing toolkit, not to mention the fact that it has a beautiful, simple, modern design. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388572/aannvtdii7op5rk4xrct.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>No more guessing: the exact amount, every time</strong></p>
<p>Continuing with measuring process, we have included a optimally proportioned scoop in order to properly allot the correct amount of coffee or tea for the brewing process. </p>
<p>Crafted out of anodized, high-grade titanium, the scoops strength will ensure a long lifetime of use. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388603/hjasphxkwbiwbsnsxalf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The golden-ratio for brewing</strong></p>
<p>The perfect balance of coffee/tea, water &amp; mug</p>
<p>By preparing the scoop to work in conjunction with the fill-lines on the pitcher and the size of the mug, we've cracked the code for the ideal cup of coffee or tea.</p>
<p>For coffee, two leveled off, packed scoops (equal to 17g of coffee) should be brewed with 300ml of near-boiling water (coffee fill-line on the pitcher). </p>
<p>For tea, one loose scoop (roughly 7 or 8 grams of loose tea) should be steeped with 350ml of near-boiling water (tea fill-line on the pitcher). </p>
<p>Included with ever purchase of the brewing system, we will provide a helpful guide to get you started with brewing perfect beverages in no time!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388628/c9jkpcqac3q0cawoouxk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>One good stir stick is all you need</strong></p>
<p>Stop the unnecessary waste of disposable alternatives. With this stir stick, you won't need another one for years to come. Durable and sleek, this is a much higher quality product than those cheap wooden versions. </p>
<p>Made from aerospace-grade titanium with non-toxic anodized color, this is probably the nicest stir stick you'll ever own. Over engineered to ensure unparalleled longevity and measured specifically to fit the KOPI Mug. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388657/srezygsjxlbg2gqctoqk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Enjoy your coffee/tea with milk, sugar or whatever suits your taste: the stirring stick is ideal for making sure everything is combined into a perfect blend. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388689/j4e5ob1smvsmhznlbwvn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For a premium, high-quality drinking experience, your coffee or tea has got to be as fresh as possible. With the canister, you can ensure that the quality will last for a long period of time. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388709/xlf4ppx7ia9u1bqmzyqd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Say goodbye to stale coffee...</strong></p>
<p>Integral  to the design of the canister is the one-way valve: while coffee ages, it releases CO2, which can contaminate the grounds, leaving them stale. By releasing this gas via a one-way exit, no oxygen can get back into the canister, stalling the aging process and maximizing freshness. </p>
<p>Whether you are using tea or coffee, whole beans or ground, you can count on the ceramic coated canister to provide ample freshness-preserving technology. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558388729/sgq4lxmpo787jmsohiis.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It is easy to clean and very solid: the ceramic coating also makes it so any odors or residue cannot seep into the body of the canister itself. </p>
<p><strong>Color/Size Options:</strong></p>
<p>Currently offered in both white and black, with both a larger and smaller version available. </p>
<p>Small canister capacity: 1.4 lb / 640 g of coffee beans</p>

Born out of disappointment with current offerings, we decided to design the next step in mug evolution. This is the only naturally sourced, porcelain ceramic self-warming mug on the market - eco-friendly and very durable.


The KOPI Mug is a two part system, featuring the mug itself and a heating coaster that doubles as a top-of-the-line wireless cellphone charger. 
The mug itself is strong: crafted out of high quality ceramic and hand fired by skilled artisans, the KOPI Mug has been exactingly designed to guarantee a long future of usage.
Every mug comes with a lid included, designed to fit snug on the top of the mug and help it retain its internal temperature. 
No more cold coffee...
Through the aid of electromagnetic energy, inlaid metallic particles within the base of the mug heats up. Thanks to this process, your drink will stay warm for a much longer amount of time than with traditional mugs, retaining its heat and maintaining enjoyable quality of your beverage.  


Keeps your coffee/tea at the perfect drinking temperature
The key aspect of an enjoyable coffee or tea drinking experience is the prolonged warmth of the drink itself. Scientifically speaking, the optimal temperature which to enjoy hot beverages is 130°F/54°C. The KOPI Mug is designed to maintain this average temperature for a prolonged period of time, allowing the flavor and freshness of the drink to be preserved. Included with every mug, the lid also helps to ensure maximized warmth for the longest time possible.
 
Heating Performance Analysis
Performed in room temperature 68°F/20°C for four hours, both with and without the lid. Demonstrates the capacity for the mug/coaster combo to keep your drink at or above an enjoyable temperature (120°F/49°C) for at least four hours.

On Porcelain Ceramic:
With a well managed, heat-efficient kiln using non-toxic materials, there are few materials in the world that can match the durability and eco-friendliness of ceramic. Not only this, but ceramic offers unlimited variety in molding shape and form - in other words, ceramic offers us to perfectly fine tune the mug design to be the most ergonomic option available.
Not only is porcelain more dense than basic ceramic, but due to its through-body composition, it is considered more durable and better suited for heavy usage than basic ceramic. Because of this higher density, porcelain is less porous and therefore more suited to handling liquids, especially hot ones. 
Color Options:
The mug is currently offered in white, black, and gray. 

Not only does it heat your mug, it also charges your phone
While the heating coaster provides the function of warming the mug, it offers another utilitarian purpose: wireless cellphone charger.
In designing the charging base, we knew it needed to have multiple functions: anything that goes on your desk or countertop needs to be worth the space it takes up. Because of this line of thinking, we decided to not only ensure quality mug-warming capabilities, but add the included functional versatility of a wireless phone charger. 
Since the unit does not actually heat up, rather providing an electric charge to heat the inlaid materials within the mug, it will remain cool to the touch, allowing your phone to be place on top without risk of damage. 


Sleek and stylish
The charger unit, while a wholly functional piece of technology, looks absolutely gorgeous. Offered in both white and black, it offers a modern aesthetic touch to any space, whether in the office or at home. It's footprint is minimal, only 8mm thick, meaning it won't take up a lot of room and can be transported easily. 

Boasting an extremely solid CNC machined aluminum body with anodized color as well as a strong tempered glass surface, the charger is built to last. With a water resistant design, this unit will never become susceptible to the occasional spill. Also included in the design, the LED indicator lights offer activation confirmation. 

Qi wireless charging technology
Qi wireless technology uses electromagnetic induction to provide the fastest available wireless charge for all modern smartphones. State-of-the-art coils allow for flawless connection, every time. 
Even without the ability to heat the KOPI Mug, the charging base is among the best wireless chargers available on the market today. Quality materials, attentive design, and solid technology  blend together to create this fantastic device.
This charger has been specifically designed to be compatible with the mug - no other charger can guarantee the same results capable with our optimized version. 
Safety

Because the inlaid metallic particles within the mug are the only things reacting to the wireless power, the charger itself does not actually get hot (there are no heating coils) and, therefore, reduces the risk of being burned. Safety is of our outmost concern, and the KOPI Mug has been rigorously designed to meet our standards.
Color Options:
Currently offered in both White Glass/Light Gray Aluminum and Black Glass/Dark Gray Aluminum.

How to add Add-Ons to KOPI Mug
1. Choose reward level
Everybody can choose one (and only one) reward level to back our project. You will receive all the items included in the reward level you select. 
2. If you want to add something, check out the add-on menu.
If you want to add something additional to your selected reward level, simply select the item from the add-on menu below and increase your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can add more than one add-on - in fact, there is no limit to how many you can add.
For example:
If you choose the $60 Self-Warming Mug & Charger and want to add one more mug + one stir stick
Click the $60 reward and make a pledge of $83 ($60 + $15 + $8)
3. Relax, you're all set!
All additional necessary details, such as shipping information, color preference, and add-on specifics, will be collected via our end-of-campaign survey. At this time, you will still be able to add-on additional items if you didn't get the chance to do so.  


The KOPI Mug comes with all the tools you need for a perfect cup of your favorite hot beverage - i.e. glass pitcher, titanium stirrer, reusable coffee/tea filters and an air tight canister to keep everything fresh. 

Make your own gourmet coffee and save money
Experts and aficionados agree that brewing with the “pour-over” method produces the best possible cup of coffee or tea - this process helps to emphasize natural oils and flavors, bringing out the full potential of every cup. Our titanium filters offer the ideal vehicle to use during this brewing procedure. 
Needless to say, you’ll never need to use another disposable filter again. Easily washable, compact, and extremely strong, these filters will last for years to come.   
Offered in both coffee and tea varieties, each is specially crafted to perfect each individual style of brewing (drip coffee method vs. steep tea method). While coffee benefits from the slow drip method, exposing the infused coffee for a short period of time to decrease potential bitterness, tea tastes best when steeped for a longer interval. 

The filters are made out of high-quality (316) stainless steel, coated with a layer of resilient titanium. They feature laser cut, micro filtration technology: a double layer mesh ensures that nothing but the pure brewed liquid makes it through without clogging. 

Need hot water? Simply Microwave it!
Preparing the water for the brew process is as easy as filling the pitcher, popping it into the microwave, and, depending on the strength of your microwave, heating it for three minutes (until the water is about to boil - roughly 200°F/93°C). From there, start brewing! 
The exact amount of water...
When it comes to brewing coffee and tea, many elements of the process require scientific rigor and attention to detail: none more so than the proper ratio of liquid to coffee/tea. In order to simplify the process of measuring out the right amount of water for the KOPI Mug, we are offering a top-of-the-line pitcher with both coffee and tea fill-lines. 

By crafting the pitcher out of thick, heat-resistant and non-porous Borosilicate glass, we ensure that the glass itself will remain in pristine condition instead of absorbing residues and odors over time.  
Compact, lightweight, extra-strong: this pitcher adds another necessary tool to your brewing toolkit, not to mention the fact that it has a beautiful, simple, modern design. 

No more guessing: the exact amount, every time
Continuing with measuring process, we have included a optimally proportioned scoop in order to properly allot the correct amount of coffee or tea for the brewing process. 
Crafted out of anodized, high-grade titanium, the scoops strength will ensure a long lifetime of use. 

The golden-ratio for brewing
The perfect balance of coffee/tea, water & mug
By preparing the scoop to work in conjunction with the fill-lines on the pitcher and the size of the mug, we've cracked the code for the ideal cup of coffee or tea.
For coffee, two leveled off, packed scoops (equal to 17g of coffee) should be brewed with 300ml of near-boiling water (coffee fill-line on the pitcher). 
For tea, one loose scoop (roughly 7 or 8 grams of loose tea) should be steeped with 350ml of near-boiling water (tea fill-line on the pitcher). 
Included with ever purchase of the brewing system, we will provide a helpful guide to get you started with brewing perfect beverages in no time!

One good stir stick is all you need
Stop the unnecessary waste of disposable alternatives. With this stir stick, you won't need another one for years to come. Durable and sleek, this is a much higher quality product than those cheap wooden versions. 
Made from aerospace-grade titanium with non-toxic anodized color, this is probably the nicest stir stick you'll ever own. Over engineered to ensure unparalleled longevity and measured specifically to fit the KOPI Mug. 

Enjoy your coffee/tea with milk, sugar or whatever suits your taste: the stirring stick is ideal for making sure everything is combined into a perfect blend. 

For a premium, high-quality drinking experience, your coffee or tea has got to be as fresh as possible. With the canister, you can ensure that the quality will last for a long period of time. 

Say goodbye to stale coffee...
Integral  to the design of the canister is the one-way valve: while coffee ages, it releases CO2, which can contaminate the grounds, leaving them stale. By releasing this gas via a one-way exit, no oxygen can get back into the canister, stalling the aging process and maximizing freshness. 
Whether you are using tea or coffee, whole beans or ground, you can count on the ceramic coated canister to provide ample freshness-preserving technology. 

It is easy to clean and very solid: the ceramic coating also makes it so any odors or residue cannot seep into the body of the canister itself. 
Color/Size Options:
Currently offered in both white and black, with both a larger and smaller version available. 
Small canister capacity: 1.4 lb / 640 g of coffee beans
Large canister capacity: 2.1 lb / 960 g of coffee beans 
 
KOPI Coffee Brewing Guide: 
Here is a simple, step-by-step guide to brewing your own fantastic coffee using the KOPI Mug and Brewing System. While the coffee brewing process is slightly more time consuming than the brewing process for tea, the results are worth the wait.

A bright future...
Since ancient times, coffee has brought people together. Today, coffee culture has blossomed into something beyond imagining. People, more than ever before, care about a quality brew. With our meticulously perfected brewing system, we aim to bring ease and convenience to high-standard coffee making. 
Not only are we here to improve the quality of coffee being consumed, but also the processes by which we brew. By doing away with wasteful practices and replacing them with extremely resilient alternatives that will, in the end, result in a HIGHER quality outcome, we are attempting to reduce waste and make coffee/tea consumption more sustainable. 
We have already diverted capital to fund our design process as well as consumer research, so now all that is left to do is to push to product to full-scale manufacturing! With your help, we can make this a reality! 
Here at TWINZ, we hope to continue this longstanding human tradition with a unique inventiveness you will appreciate. To the next cup! 
Cheers,
The TWINZ Team

We've modified our brew time to yield exactly the flavor we are constantly looking for when trying different cold brew. Instead of putting our brew in the corner and letting it sit - out of sight, out of mind - we monitor each batch to ensure that it is brewing exactly the way we want it to. One of the reasons people over-extract their cold brew (simply brewing it too long) is so that they can make it as strong as possible. However, it's not just about the time. Time needs to go hand-in-hand with proper temperature and an even mixture. We don't let the grounds just sit on top, they need room to breathe and get to know each other so that ALL of those flavors can come alive! With our proprietary method, we have greatly shortened the brew time, while also delivering a good, strong kick.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong><br/>John, a native Texan, acquired a farm in Dutchess County, NY in 2014. It was all he had dreamed of: a little piece of heaven with forested lands, a small orchard, wild fields, a large pond - and surrounded by wetlands. His wife Frederique, born French, was with him at this start in this farming adventure. She quickly found herself gardening and slowly began re-introducing herbs, fruits and vegetables. Initially for fun and to feed her little family, she soon discovered the full potential this land had to offer!

<h3>What is our story?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Lindsey Gant! I am the  fresh-maker of The Dandy Line Kitchen and a graduate of Hope Rises. What is a fresh-maker you ask? It boils down to the fact that aside from my experience at Dandy Line, I have never been a formally trained chef. Despite my lack of formal training, I have a passion for making fresh food and serving others. I love to take food that can be seen as ""weird"" or ""unconventional"" and blow people's minds. I want to open people's eyes to this kind of food, and inspire them to expand their horizons or even just to try something different that just happens to be good for them.</p>
<p>I am a graduate of Hope Rises, a non-profit re-entry home. Prior to entering the program I had been in and out of prison. I had an addiction that consumed my life and I didn't have the tools or the support I needed to overcome it. I met the founder of Hope Rises, Kim Roxburgh, while still in prison. She taught an empowerment class and helped me see what I was capable of. I moved into the Hope Rises house and began a new journey.</p>
<p>At Hope Rises, all of the residents are required to eat clean, non-processed foods and cook for each other. That's where I began building confidence in my cooking abilities. I would try new recipes and make variations of my own. It became exciting for me! </p>
<p>But enough about me, this is who WE are, and where We come from.</p>
<p>Over time, I went from cooking in the Hope Rises house to running a meal prep delivery service now known as The Dandy Line Kitchen!</p>
<p>Currently, we have two employees, including myself, and one volunteer. We serve between 45-50 regulars a week. Our client base has been steadily increasing over the past two years, but we have hit a point where we need more resources in order to serve more.</p>
<p>We cater to individuals, families, businesses, events and you can even find our meals and other goodies at The Green Corner Store, a local sustainable living store.</p>
<p>All proceeds benefit the Mission of Hope Rises: Providing holistic services to women impacted by poverty, addiction, trauma, or incarceration to improve their health and wellbeing and provide opportunities for personal growth and empowerment.</p>
<p>At The Dandy Line Kitchen we hope to create more employment opportunities for the graduates of Hope Rises to create, invest, and grow in a local business. These experiences are more difficult to come by for them and they deserve that chance. </p>

</div></div>","What is our story?
Hi, my name is Lindsey Gant! I am the  fresh-maker of The Dandy Line Kitchen and a graduate of Hope Rises. What is a fresh-maker you ask? It boils down to the fact that aside from my experience at Dandy Line, I have never been a formally trained chef. Despite my lack of formal training, I have a passion for making fresh food and serving others. I love to take food that can be seen as ""weird"" or ""unconventional"" and blow people's minds. I want to open people's eyes to this kind of food, and inspire them to expand their horizons or even just to try something different that just happens to be good for them.
I am a graduate of Hope Rises, a non-profit re-entry home. Prior to entering the program I had been in and out of prison. I had an addiction that consumed my life and I didn't have the tools or the support I needed to overcome it. I met the founder of Hope Rises, Kim Roxburgh, while still in prison. She taught an empowerment class and helped me see what I was capable of. I moved into the Hope Rises house and began a new journey.
At Hope Rises, all of the residents are required to eat clean, non-processed foods and cook for each other. That's where I began building confidence in my cooking abilities. I would try new recipes and make variations of my own. It became exciting for me! 
But enough about me, this is who WE are, and where We come from.
Over time, I went from cooking in the Hope Rises house to running a meal prep delivery service now known as The Dandy Line Kitchen!
Currently, we have two employees, including myself, and one volunteer. We serve between 45-50 regulars a week. Our client base has been steadily increasing over the past two years, but we have hit a point where we need more resources in order to serve more.
We cater to individuals, families, businesses, events and you can even find our meals and other goodies at The Green Corner Store, a local sustainable living store.
All proceeds benefit the Mission of Hope Rises: Providing holistic services to women impacted by poverty, addiction, trauma, or incarceration to improve their health and wellbeing and provide opportunities for personal growth and empowerment.
At The Dandy Line Kitchen we hope to create more employment opportunities for the graduates of Hope Rises to create, invest, and grow in a local business. These experiences are more difficult to come by for them and they deserve that chance. 


Dandy Line Dreaming
By donating to The Dandy Line Kitchen Expansion, you will be contributing to our move to a new location where we will not only be a meal prep delivery service, but also a cafe vendor at the local law school.
Here is what we need:

New equipment for the kitchen
Dining area furniture
Startup costs
Funds to pay cafe workers until momentum of sales is established

What's in it for YOU?
In addition to contributing to our growth and our mission, you have the opportunity to try some of our products yourself!

The first 5 to donate $25 will receive a half dozen muffins of your choosing! (options: Gluten-Free Blueberry, Gluten-Free/Vegan Carrot Apple, or Gluten-Free/Vegan Lemon Poppy Seed)
The first 5 to donate $50 will receive a dozen muffins of your choosing! (options: Gluten-Free Blueberry, Gluten-Free/Vegan Carrot Apple, or Gluten-Free/Vegan Lemon Poppy Seed)
The first 3 to donate $100 will receive one full week of meals!
The first 3 to donate $250 will receive one full week of family packs!



What else?
As of right now, I do most of the prep work with the help of a one other payed employee and a volunteer who aid me in delivery and distribution. As we grow we will need more hands on deck, and with that, the money to supplement their salaries.

</ul></div>","We believe in ""the village"" -- that it takes many great minds and hearts working together to raise children who are at their best, and good, and healthy, and kind; children who are ready to learn, open to new experiences, and excited about how they will change the world.  We believe that healthy eating, with meals full of nutrient-dense foods and natural flavors are critical to this goal.  EasyPeasie is our contribution to the village, and to training the palates of our future leaders.  With EasyPeasie, we endeavor to make it easier to make kids healthier by making meals “veggier!”  We care about kids’ nutrition, and have made it our mission to provide families fun, simple, natural, and easy ways to improve every meal with added vegetable nutrition! Today, we need your support to make our dream of having EasyPeasie help every family a reality.We are Jamelah and Dorielle; sisters by birth, friends by grace.  We are the founders and owners of Easy Peasie, LLC.  A pediatrician, an engineer, and a mother between us -- we are natural problem-solvers and advocates for children and community.  When one of Dorielle’s babies needed to transition to formula so she could return to work, we didn’t want his palate to suffer.  Pediatric and nutrition studies show that as toddlers, formula-fed babies are less adventurous with new foods and flavors than their breast-fed counterparts.  We put our heads together (our village of two!) and came up with the plan to dry and grind a variety of vegetables in order to give him vegetable exposures starting in infancy.  Though we didn’t know it at the time, this was also the infancy of EasyPeasie. EasyPeasie Veggie Blends are our custom blends of dried and ground vegetables.  We call it EasyPeasie because it’s an easy way to add extra veggie nutrition to food and drinks, and we have peas in all of our blends.  The veggie combinations in each blend are specially selected to maximize nutrition and minimize “veggie taste.”  The blends are all natural, with no added sugar, no preservatives, no artificial colors nor flavors.  They are naturally gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan.  EasyPeasie is pediatrician-, mom-, and picky eater- approved!  The blends currently on the market are: “Natural Veggie Blend” (carrots, peas, sweet potatoes) and “EasyPeasie Plus Green Blend” (carrots, peas, sweet potatoes, kale, and spinach).  Our new Red Blend with beets is available in limited supply through the Fall and Winter.We celebrate the veggie-successes of our families!  With the help of our EasyPeasie reciPEAS, our families have added extra veggie nutrition to a variety of food and drinks: applesauce, oatmeal, pizza, quesadillas, rice, sauces, soups, smoothies, milk, pancakes, burgers, eggs, and more!  Our convenient packaging allows families to take their veggies ""on-the-go.""  We like to think of EasyPeasie as veggies in the best combination of convenience, shelf-life, and great nutrition!We are proud to have been featured in nutrition videos with the Afropolitan Chef and with cutting-edge concierge office, Boca VIPediatrics.  Find us in South Florida Parenting, MadameNoire, Vitamin Retailer, and PeekABoo Family Magazines; including being named one of PeekABoo Magazine’s “Favorite Things” and South Florida Parenting's ""Stuff We Love.""  We are based out of our hometown of Hallandale Beach, Florida.  Currently, families can get EasyPeasie by meeting us at our local farmers’ markets in South and Central Florida, or ordering online at easypeasie.com. Our goal is to help as many families as possible make meals veggier with EasyPeasie.  We know how excited our current families are to improve every meal with added vegetable nutrition.  We want all families to have that excitement and reassurance that getting veggies in can be EASY!  Our fundraising goal of $38,500 will help us accomplish the following…
Increased promotion and exposure (demonstration videos, website refinement, participation in trade shows/conferences in 2017)
New blend development and procurement
Preparation of product lines for retail
Focused consumer and market research
Our community service projects (support of community gardens/urban farming programs to combat food deserts, mentorship and nutrition education in the community)
Development of an EasyPeasie App (great nutritional resource for families)
If we do not reach our full goal, product promotion, preparation for retail, and new blend development will be prioritized.At the various levels of support, enjoy some of the perks we have pictured below, including gift-wrapped EasyPeasie Veggie Blends, T-shirts, tote bags, swag, and gift cards. Your support of this project will help us:
Make it easier to make kids healthier by making meals “veggier!”
Introduce more families to EasyPeasie, and allow EasyPeasie to be available to more families
Be a helpful resource for families of children with special needs and feeding difficulties
Expand our efforts to educate families and communities on the benefits of vegetables and good nutrition, including teaching healthy eating as a way to combat obesity
Bring more blends to market
Get more people to like, then love vegetables!
Our main challenges are two: (1) educating our market about palate priming and the benefits of EasyPeasie Veggie Blends, and (2) reaching more families outside of our local markets.  As doctors in the fields of pediatrics and engineering, my sister and I are well-versed in problem solving.  We are laser-focused on creating the best, most socially-responsible, highest-quality product for our families, and making our brand synonymous with our passion for this work, our attention to detail, and our care and concern for our families and kids.If you're unable to support us financially, but you still want to support this campaign, here is how you can help!

<p>Honey &amp; Roses Coffee Co. is about <strong>more than just coffee</strong>. We are a community of <strong>small businesses</strong> and coffee lovers. We've created <strong>an online marketplace </strong>that gives you access to the best <strong>small batch craft coffee</strong> roasters around the USA. All of our partners emphasize <strong>ethical Coffee sourcing and offer fair trade, organic or work with family run </strong>coffee farms when possible. We are a website that allows you to <strong>compare</strong> the coffees at a glance, our goal is to assist you to find something that <strong>works for your taste buds. We offer coffee</strong><strong> samples,</strong>  that way you feel confident in the quality before you commit to a larger bag. Every order is <strong>roasted fresh </strong>and sent out <strong>directly to you. This is not coffee </strong>sitting in a warehouse for months before it lands on the shelves.</p>
<p>We want to maintain a <strong>personal touch,</strong> whether you are new to small batch coffee or a connoisseur, we will give <strong>personal recommendations </strong>based on our experience  and flavor preferences. We will point you to something that suits you personally, hoping  our marketplace will be your<strong> final stop for all your craft coffee needs.</strong></p>
<p>We would like to think we are more than just coffee. We're incredibly passionate about <strong>eco friendly and sustainable </strong>lifestyle and have curated an entire collection based upon this vision. Our home goods are beautifully crafted by <strong>artisans across the world</strong>, many from <strong>disadvantaged communities</strong> who do not have a way to reach an international market. With sustainability and effeciancy in mind these items are <strong>perfect to gift</strong>, or enjoy with your coffee. We offer an array of home items, from resuable water bottle to cutlery. We also are trying to cultivate a group of small batch artisans in the US and we have recently launched homemade coffee scrubs, artisan chocolate and more.</p>

<h2>Why are we raising funds?</h2>
<p>We have seen <strong>fantastic progress</strong> since we launched last June, we now have partnered with <strong>over 40 small batch Coffee Roasters. </strong>And are working with multiple local <strong>artisan and creators for our home goods collection. </strong>We have now reached a point where we <strong>cannot progress further</strong> without your support.</p>
<p>In the past few months, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving a huge surge in the online coffee market,<strong> large coffee corporations </strong>with eyewatering marketing budgets have made it increasingly difficult to <strong>reach our market and share our coffee community with all of you.</strong> Our existing and loyal customers <strong>come back time and again</strong>, but we are only able to grow our community if <strong>people are able to find us online. </strong> We want to be able to share the <strong>positive impact</strong> and help assist the whole supply chain, from the farmers that <strong>lovingly grow the beans,</strong> to the roasters that <strong>expertly roast</strong> the coffee - all the way to you <strong>enjoying your morning cup.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$28,000 </strong>will allow us to <strong>hire a part time marketing analyst</strong>/contributors to optimise our campaigns across platforms, conduct efficient trend analysis and <strong>diversify</strong> our marketing strategy.</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Trans-Fat-Free, Shake-To-Drink Milk Tea</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dear Indiegogo backers, our products are already made and ready to ship. Our team is a long time fan for the crowdfunding community and we'd like to give back with honest &amp; discounted offers. Enjoy now!</strong></p>
<p>A ground-breaking 100% fresh, zero trans fat shake-to-drink milk tea.</p>
<p>We provide an experience where you can bring all the best ingredients with you, easily shake into delicious milk tea wherever and whenever you want a sip!</p>
<p>Unlike typical milk tea in the market which uses powders and artificial flavors, we believe that the best milk tea can only be made from high-grade, fresh-brewed tea leaves. Thus, we only collect the competition-grade, first harvest tea from their true origins such as Fujian China, and Sri Lanka. Then, the local farmers use a low-heat baking process to help develop the aroma of the tea and make sure every brew brings the best flavor even to critique standards. After countless experiments and tastings, we are confident that OhTea delivers the best tea flavor that guarantees your satisfaction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614894573/ecfjlyeiglscgofhyvly.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our packaging withstands high heat from hot water so it serves as both packaging and container. We put ingredients into this uniquely designed bag that seals the fresh flavors. All you need to do is pouring warm or cold water to make everything alive and shake it to blend everything together. We also strongly recommend throwing the milk tea into the refrigerator for 2 hours after you shake it to enjoy the ice-cold version!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614923732/khuu9vupfecqlil786mm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The package can lock the fresh taste for hours long, so there’s no more hassle of finishing your milk tea after opening - take a delicious sip whenever, wherever you like and bring it with you all day long!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The freedom to make the milk tea of your own style</strong></p>
<p>You can enjoy our product ice or hot, strong or light, whichever way you like! If you are tired of the preset sweetness level and taste of the RTD drinks, you would definitely love the way Ohtea is designed. If you want a stronger and sweeter taste, you can put hot water into the package, and shake vigorously to let the full taste come out. However, if you are someone who prefers lighter, and less sweet beverages, just use room temperature water to steep, and enjoy when it reaches the sweetness level you desire.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614894779/rgepzw7zgmhc4sp5swca.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The power of supporting small tea-farmers</strong></p>
<p>At Ohtea, we understand it might be a difficult time for many small business owners. We chose to only partner with small but quality tea-farmers of lesser scale to help them maintain their business growth. We want to carry this mission forward to always support traditional tea-farming techniques and ancient tea-roasting methods. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Products</h3>
<p>There are three main parts of ingredients in the product: original tea leaves, New Zealand milk powder, and non-dairy powder. For the non-dairy powder part, it does contain ingredients like regular sugar, soybean oil, and palm oil; however, there is no wheat/gluten in the product, and no trans-fat. We selected a premium source of ingredients to only make sure that the products you get from Ohtea taste totally different from the beverages you had before. As soon as you open the package, you can smell the fresh and pleasant aroma of the tea leaves. After the water is added, the tea leaves slowly mix with the milk powder and develop a sweet, creamy, and well-balanced taste of the milk tea that you cannot resist. </p>
<p>Every tea type has its own magical taste when mixing with the milk, we select the three signature tea types with distinctive aroma and body, and we want to share their origins and uniqueness with you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614895020/t1bmqfimewwbowhj3vkn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Wuyi black tea is the very first black tea grown in the world originated from the Wuyi Mountain region in China. Wuyi black tea has a signature smoky and fruity flavor and produces a natural honey scent when brewed. The high mineral content of the soil, the humid climate, as well as the narrow valley come together and enable the tea to grow without the risk of scorching or bitterness, but contain rich minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. The thin, twisted leaves produce a sweet fragrance before steeping; once brewed, the tea offers up aromas of smoky caramel and earthy, rich wheat flavors with a hint of sweetness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614895074/fvjwhjyfnhenqdsnixrb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ceylon black tea refers to the geographical region, Sri Lanka (previously known as Ceylon) is the most famous black tea around the globe. The high-grown black tea offers a bold, full, and brisk palette. It has medium-to-full tannins and some notes of citrus, chocolate, or spice. Ceylon is among the best teas which have a distinct flavor, aroma, and strength with a burgundy brown body.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614895091/bjvzibgjitpemcymuysf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Four Seasons Oolong tea is a high-mountain tea that has been hand-picked and hand-processed by traditional methods. For typical tea types, only the first harvest of the year produces the best tea flavor. However, Four Seasons Oolong remains the same quality all year round. The tea body is extremely smooth and light. When brewed, it has a delightful floral and sweet taste with a stronger creamy finish.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why We Did It</h3>
<p>It’s simply not possible to have a great tea shop right next to you. Every time when we want fresh milk tea, we have to go through a long and painful line. How about those on the grocery shelf? Sadly, the convenient beverages are artificially flavored, and … freshly brewed tea is always the best. Oh, you can definitely order delivery, but what about the associated cost... does it make you hesitate every time you place an order?</p>
<p>What if there is a new way of making fresh and delicious milk tea so that we can enjoy it whenever and wherever without compromising its taste? Boom, we have created the perfect solution: OhTea, and it changes everything.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615248900/no5gkporptxvhygacagb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the journey of crafting our shake-to-drink tea beverage, we have tasted the best products in the market and been through 15 iterations of design and prototyping. It’s hard to find the best ingredients from origins such as Fujian, China, and Sri Lanka, and even harder to produce balanced recipes. The team has physically assembled, tested, and debated which is the “right” drink to “wow” you, our friend, and tea lover.</p>
<p>BTW, you might not even know, Shake-to-drink milk tea has already become a phenomenon in Asian countries like China and Korea. Join us, and the millions of shake-to-drink tea lovers; Let's Make Milkea Great Again! ;)</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Lastly...</h3>
<p>I vaguely remember those years, when I had long working hours and high labor intensity, and felt that I couldn't make it, it was just a cup of milk tea, which allowed the afternoon shift to continue and recharge my body and soul. Such simple happiness makes the afternoon sunshine even more bright. Looking for that pleasant temperature in your intense life, you can always continue to move forward. In this sense, milk tea is a spiritual beverage.</p>
<p>From the old Tea Horse Road to the world-famous milk tea, the passion for tea never stopped. Originated from China, now onto the World, we know Ohtea.co brings you not only tasty products but also an embodiment of the culture that brings people together. When we meet new friends from different backgrounds, we’d love to welcome everyone with a cup of tea, extending our love and respect.</p>

Our packaging withstands high heat from hot water so it serves as both packaging and container. We put ingredients into this uniquely designed bag that seals the fresh flavors. All you need to do is pouring warm or cold water to make everything alive and shake it to blend everything together. We also strongly recommend throwing the milk tea into the refrigerator for 2 hours after you shake it to enjoy the ice-cold version!

The package can lock the fresh taste for hours long, so there’s no more hassle of finishing your milk tea after opening - take a delicious sip whenever, wherever you like and bring it with you all day long!
 
The freedom to make the milk tea of your own style
You can enjoy our product ice or hot, strong or light, whichever way you like! If you are tired of the preset sweetness level and taste of the RTD drinks, you would definitely love the way Ohtea is designed. If you want a stronger and sweeter taste, you can put hot water into the package, and shake vigorously to let the full taste come out. However, if you are someone who prefers lighter, and less sweet beverages, just use room temperature water to steep, and enjoy when it reaches the sweetness level you desire.

The power of supporting small tea-farmers
At Ohtea, we understand it might be a difficult time for many small business owners. We chose to only partner with small but quality tea-farmers of lesser scale to help them maintain their business growth. We want to carry this mission forward to always support traditional tea-farming techniques and ancient tea-roasting methods. 
 
Our Products
There are three main parts of ingredients in the product: original tea leaves, New Zealand milk powder, and non-dairy powder. For the non-dairy powder part, it does contain ingredients like regular sugar, soybean oil, and palm oil; however, there is no wheat/gluten in the product, and no trans-fat. We selected a premium source of ingredients to only make sure that the products you get from Ohtea taste totally different from the beverages you had before. As soon as you open the package, you can smell the fresh and pleasant aroma of the tea leaves. After the water is added, the tea leaves slowly mix with the milk powder and develop a sweet, creamy, and well-balanced taste of the milk tea that you cannot resist. 
Every tea type has its own magical taste when mixing with the milk, we select the three signature tea types with distinctive aroma and body, and we want to share their origins and uniqueness with you. 

Wuyi black tea is the very first black tea grown in the world originated from the Wuyi Mountain region in China. Wuyi black tea has a signature smoky and fruity flavor and produces a natural honey scent when brewed. The high mineral content of the soil, the humid climate, as well as the narrow valley come together and enable the tea to grow without the risk of scorching or bitterness, but contain rich minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. The thin, twisted leaves produce a sweet fragrance before steeping; once brewed, the tea offers up aromas of smoky caramel and earthy, rich wheat flavors with a hint of sweetness.

Ceylon black tea refers to the geographical region, Sri Lanka (previously known as Ceylon) is the most famous black tea around the globe. The high-grown black tea offers a bold, full, and brisk palette. It has medium-to-full tannins and some notes of citrus, chocolate, or spice. Ceylon is among the best teas which have a distinct flavor, aroma, and strength with a burgundy brown body.

Four Seasons Oolong tea is a high-mountain tea that has been hand-picked and hand-processed by traditional methods. For typical tea types, only the first harvest of the year produces the best tea flavor. However, Four Seasons Oolong remains the same quality all year round. The tea body is extremely smooth and light. When brewed, it has a delightful floral and sweet taste with a stronger creamy finish.
Why We Did It
It’s simply not possible to have a great tea shop right next to you. Every time when we want fresh milk tea, we have to go through a long and painful line. How about those on the grocery shelf? Sadly, the convenient beverages are artificially flavored, and … freshly brewed tea is always the best. Oh, you can definitely order delivery, but what about the associated cost... does it make you hesitate every time you place an order?
What if there is a new way of making fresh and delicious milk tea so that we can enjoy it whenever and wherever without compromising its taste? Boom, we have created the perfect solution: OhTea, and it changes everything.

In the journey of crafting our shake-to-drink tea beverage, we have tasted the best products in the market and been through 15 iterations of design and prototyping. It’s hard to find the best ingredients from origins such as Fujian, China, and Sri Lanka, and even harder to produce balanced recipes. The team has physically assembled, tested, and debated which is the “right” drink to “wow” you, our friend, and tea lover.
BTW, you might not even know, Shake-to-drink milk tea has already become a phenomenon in Asian countries like China and Korea. Join us, and the millions of shake-to-drink tea lovers; Let's Make Milkea Great Again! ;)
 

What We Need & What You Get

We come from diverse backgrounds and are all passionate about tea. Although we work in different industries--tech, art, business--we deeply care about what we drink and what we deliver to you.
We believe the best product can only be made from the best ingredients. Ohtea is committed to actively engage these tea farmers and deliver the most authentic taste without the middleman. One sip is all you need to tell the difference.
We think the best design does not need to be sophisticated - our ideal is to make great products that are simple to make and fun to indulge. Thus, we are proud to bring you this shake-to-drink tea - delicious, freshly made by YOU to enjoy anytime, anywhere!
We are asking $5,000 to kickstart our manufacturing & supply chain. And we are aiming for $15,000 to make our product a real business. Our plan is to deliver the first batch to our Kickstarter supporters and scale-out the production size and start selling online - make this great product available to every corner of the world.


Lastly...
I vaguely remember those years, when I had long working hours and high labor intensity, and felt that I couldn't make it, it was just a cup of milk tea, which allowed the afternoon shift to continue and recharge my body and soul. Such simple happiness makes the afternoon sunshine even more bright. Looking for that pleasant temperature in your intense life, you can always continue to move forward. In this sense, milk tea is a spiritual beverage.
From the old Tea Horse Road to the world-famous milk tea, the passion for tea never stopped. Originated from China, now onto the World, we know Ohtea.co brings you not only tasty products but also an embodiment of the culture that brings people together. When we meet new friends from different backgrounds, we’d love to welcome everyone with a cup of tea, extending our love and respect.

Risks & Challenges
We take your trust in us seriously and are so excited to welcome you as part of this journey. By the end of our campaign, we will be ready to release the pledge manager for our backers so we can start the manufacturing process as soon as possible. Although we have accounted for possible issues that may arise during shipping, customs, and manufacturing, we strive for transparency and will communicate the successes and challenges we encounter at a minimum of monthly updates. We're committed to you in each step of this journey, and appreciate your overwhelming support and accountability as our backers. Thanks for your constant encouragement as we continue to expand the wonderful world of tea! COVID-19: Our production partner and other suppliers are back to normal since the beginning of May 2020, so we don't expect any delays as of right now. We're closely monitoring the situation and will provide you with regular updates if any delays occur. Thanks for being so tea-rrific!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan O'Rourke, and I am the founder of Ironclad Coffee Roasters, located in Richmond, Virginia, USA.  <strong>We began planning for the establishment of Ironclad in 2015 while still living in Ireland. </strong> Over the course of five years in ""The Land of Saints and Scholars,"" my understanding of what coffee can be was blown wide open by some of the best roasting companies in all of Europe.  <strong>We bring a piece of those influences to the east coast of the U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our first (nearly) two years in business have been a resounding success. </strong> Our wholesale partnerships have been popping up all around the Richmond metro area and beyond, and our revenues have increased greatly from year one to year two.  Of course, this doesn't mean we're over here rolling in a pile of money!  We've been fastidious about investing those profits back into the business to keep the growth and momentum going.  We've also been active in sharing those profits with worthy charitable causes and organizations around our own community and in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign is an essential piece to the process of initiating ""Phase Two"" of Ironclad.  <strong>We have signed a lease on a fantastic historic building in the heart of the city of Richmond, and now we need to begin filling that space with our buildout and equipment that will get the most out of the coffee we roast and serve.</strong>  Not long after opening the doors of the roastery, we began to yearn for a place where we could serve and showcase some of the more rare and exquisite single-origin coffees that we are fortunate to source from around the world.</p>

<p><strong>When you invest in this campaign, you are investing in us.  You are investing in people who love their industry, love their community, love to serve, love to educate, and love to give back generously.</strong>  We have put together a healthy package of ""perks"" for investors -- the value of which actually <i>exceed</i> the amount invested in <u>every</u> <u>single</u> <u>case</u>.  We wanted to do this in appreciation for you helping us get ""Phase Two"" off the ground, and we absolutely cannot do this the right way without buy-in from those of you who have watched us grow from the ground up.  If you believe in us and our product, we can assure you that this next step of Ironclad will only enhance our ability to bring you (and thousands of others) an even higher level of quality in your coffee experiences.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>$25,000</strong> is the goal we have set for this campaign.  <strong>The bulk of that will be utilized in the buildout and in purchasing the equipment needed </strong>for brewing delicious Ironclad-roasted coffees in the most effective way.  We have seen other businesses raise tens of thousands of dollars with incredibly meager investor perks, so we're confident our generous perk package will be the boost needed to get us up and over our campaign goal!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The obvious impact is more delicious coffee for Richmond (and much further afield for those of you who order from our website).  However, if you are familiar with <strong>our passion for charitable giving and community involvement</strong>, you'll understand that the impact goes beyond merely great coffee.  Our humble little start-up has been around for less than two years, but <strong>we have contributed a little over $20,000</strong> to causes and organizations right here in Richmond, in other states, and even in other countries.  That number will grow as our business grows.  <strong>So, if you believe in backing businesses who give back, we would certainly appreciate your investment!</strong></p>

With Flatware, you'll never have to reach for the single-use plastic again.  
 This is our 7th crowdfunded product; we always deliver. GoSun has developed breakthrough solar technologies that can cook, cool, light or charge your electronics. All of our products are portable, highly efficient and free of harmful emissions. 
 
 Protecting you from unwanted grease, these self-contained utensils are able to travel with you anywhere.  Flatware is great for eating on-the-go: cafe, salad bar, campsite, event, cafeteria, carryout, and the list goes on.  Flatware is simple to use - just pop it out of its case, slide the utensil out and lock it in place. When you're finished eating, simply clean them off and stow away.    Let's put an END to single-use plasticPlastic utensils are tremendously wasteful, but we often don't have a choice. They're usually the only option at parties, events or salad bars. Reusable utensils exist, but they are large and impractical to carry around with you.So, we got to thinking..... what if there was a full-size, reusable cutlery set that was effortless to carry? What if it was so thin that it could even fit into your wallet? Introducing Flatware: Full-size reusable utensils that fit into a wallet, so you don't have to remember to bring it with you. Flatware is:

Effortless: Flatware fits in your wallet, purse or pocket, so that it's effortless to bring with you on-the-go!

Self-Contained: When packed away, the utensils are fully contained so they wont contaminate your belongings.

Super Clean: The stainless steel fork & knife remove completely from their handles for easy cleanup. Flatware is 100% dishwasher safe.

Zero Waste: Flatware is designed to last, so that you'll never have to reach for the single-use plastic again!

Lightweight and Ultra-Portable: 3.5 credit cards in size and weighs 1.4 ounces (40 grams).
  Using Flatware is easy. Just pop it out of its case, slide the utensil until it clicks into place, and enjoy.  There is no compromise of strength, comfort or ability to scoop, skewer, slice, stir, or spread.  We designed Flatware to go with you, anywhere. If you can remember your phone or wallet when you leave your house, you'll remember your Flatware. At just 3.5 credit cards thick, it fits into just about any credit card slot.  There are other portable cutlery sets, but none of them are truly portable, which means they don't travel well. They're big, bulky and get covered in food debris that makes a mess inside your bag or purse. Don't even mention carrying one in your wallet.There are lots of ways to carry GoSun Flatware: purse, wallet, pocket, bag, elastic band, pouch, backpack, etc.  When you're finished eating, the utensil can be removed from its handle for easy cleaning.  Alternatively, you can store the used utensils in the protective case and wash when it is more convenient. The dirty, temporarily stored utensil will be sealed from spreading dirt.Stainless steel is the best thing that ever happened to cutlery. Now, GoSun Flatware is the best thing that ever happened to portable, reusable cutlery.  Flatware is made from 301 Stainless Steel - the same material that is used on today's rocketship craft. It is lightweight, beautiful and virtually indestructible. Please back this project, we know you'll love it.
 
 


 
 

We love Flatware, so we wanted to see what other people thought about it in real life scenarios.  With nothing but a few friends and a smartphone, we put together this video showing a solid Flatware prototype shoveling food into beautiful faces.One designer's journey from creating the destructive to finding a path for the constructive.  Listen to where GoSun Flatware came from. 
 


 
 

Nate Maggard has been GoSun's lead designer for over five years.  With incredible vision and craftsmanship, anything he touches turns to gold (in this case, it's actually stainless steel). Together we can make single-use plastic a thing of the past. With our everyday choices, we can Un-Fork the World.  Each set of Flatware comes packaged in a set of six Awareness cards that are for sharing the message of eliminating single-use plastic. Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer free shipping anywhere in the world on the single set of Flatware. 
 Learn more about the bundled reward levels with these links below:
SolarPanel 10: Solar Phone Charger ($99)

 This is GoSun's 7th unique product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over the years, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.

<h3>SaludPgh</h3>
<p>SaludPgh was started by myself, Sha-King Cehum, a Pittsburgh Born and bred first generation Puerto Rican. Inspired by my family and cultural background,  I began cooking plant-based dishes with traditional ingredients for my children when i was a stay-at-home dad. Starting out with brunches and farmer’s markets, I officially launched “SaludPgh” in Spring of 2014. Since then my business has gained a lot of support from both vegans and non-vegans. With a passion for offering healthier food options, I want to become more accessible to the greater Pittsburgh area by becoming more mobile with a greater capacity for service. So I’ve decided to take the steps towards a food truck. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal </h3>
<p>I am asking you to support me in raising $30K to transform a mail truck into a food truck. I’ve selected a 1994 Chevy P30 step-van for the project. The funds will go into cutting out a service window, running electrical wiring and plumbing, installing a solar panel to off-set generator power, installing a ventilation hood and purchasing key kitchen equipment. Every contribution helps us get closer to our goal. We’re offering several incentives at the different donation levels to show our appreciation for your contributions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support for this campaign doesn’t simply boost a small business’s growth. Your support helps healthful food options reach a wider range of people. You’re assisting in changing the landscape  of Pittsburgh’s culinary scene by allowing a larger audience to experience more possibilities in their dining choices. Additionally, you’re helping usher in an even more diverse small business community within the region. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Building out a food truck from scratch will no doubt be a lot of work. While we’ve researched costs for materials and the details of the process, we have to brace for set backs and unforeseen complications. Nonetheless, it will all be a labor of love and we are confident we will fulfill our project vision. . </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Spread the love! </h3>
<p>We understand that every person’s situation is different. Everyone may not be able to contribute funds during our campaign. Yet they can still help us meet our goal by spreading the love and sharing our campaign information with someone who can! Tell your friends and family, post the campaign links on your social media sites or forward it to folks through text message and email. We appreciate any and all efforts in making our vision materialize. </p>

On wing day at my local restaurant they wash 100s of bowls multiple times.  Seeing all this water usage I felt I had to do something to try and make a difference. I wanted to make at least a small impact on water conservation. Considering 58,000,000 wings get served every day and on Super Bowl Sunday, 1 billion wings are tossed, the amount of water being used is mind boggling. That's why I developed the Alumiliner. I believe this product could be the largest water-saving initiative in restaurant history. </p><p>After a lot of thought and testing, the Alumiliner came to be. Many friends in the industry were awestruck by this simple idea and asked, <i><strong>""Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?""</strong></i></p><p>Simply secure the Alumiliner in the bowl, add your wings, sauce, toss and remove the liner. The liner can be moved straight to a serving basket. A customer who doesn't finish their wings can crimp the edges of the foil liner and take it to go. Pretty cool.</p><p><strong>Alumiliner has several noteworthy features:</strong></p><ul style=""margin-top:20px;padding:10px 0 10px 30px;border-radius:5px;background:#eee;margin-bottom:25px;border:1px solid #ddd;"">

On wing day at my local restaurant they wash 100s of bowls multiple times.  Seeing all this water usage I felt I had to do something to try and make a difference. I wanted to make at least a small impact on water conservation. Considering 58,000,000 wings get served every day and on Super Bowl Sunday, 1 billion wings are tossed, the amount of water being used is mind boggling. That's why I developed the Alumiliner. I believe this product could be the largest water-saving initiative in restaurant history. After a lot of thought and testing, the Alumiliner came to be. Many friends in the industry were awestruck by this simple idea and asked, ""Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?""Simply secure the Alumiliner in the bowl, add your wings, sauce, toss and remove the liner. The liner can be moved straight to a serving basket. A customer who doesn't finish their wings can crimp the edges of the foil liner and take it to go. Pretty cool.Alumiliner has several noteworthy features:
Saving millions of gallons of water a year
Saves both time and labor
Saves space
Helps avoid cross-contamination
Made from recycled material and can be recycled

<p><strong>MY STORY:</strong><br/>I was raised in a family that made their living from coffee, and nothing frustrated me more than watching them continually get stuck in the producing stage all their lives, so when I started my own coffee farm, I thought long and hard about how to break out of the same routine. My family lives in San Jose De Oriente Santa Barbara Honduras, where I was born and raised. This village consists of small coffee producers that often times have to use all of their resources just to buy a plot of land. They are generally happy with ½, ¾ or 1 manzana (1 manzana = 0.77 hectare), where they cultivate corn, beans, vegetables and Arabica coffee. It’s not easy for these local farmers to wait 3 years for a producing crop of Arabica coffee, only to sell harvest at a minimal price. These farmers can’t even pay for related plant nutrition and maintenance based on the measly earnings received from the coffee broker.<br/><br/>My whole life I have dreamed of having a coffee farm so that I can work close to nature, save and protect the fauna, save, protect and repopulate the forest, and create a place to demonstrate that coffee can be grown in the forest without deforesting it. I did not cut down any old trees to make way for coffee plants; instead, I planted underneath the big old trees. My number one priority is to produce a specialty, high quality coffee while saving and protecting the environment. Currently my focus on this farm is to introduce coffee farmers to a new coffee era where their regular bean can be transformed into a specialty bean by following some strict quality control guidelines. It won’t be an easy task to break the local farmers’ habits of coffee processing, but I’m confident that it can be done and convinced that the rewards will be greater if they adhere to certain guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>LOCAL COFFEE FARMERS’ CUSTOMS:</strong><br/>I know everyone in this village and they also know me well. So far there is not one coffee farmer processing specialty coffee. On rare occasions they dry the coffee beans(dry parchment) in concrete patios before they sell them at the local coffee broker and the majority of the farmers sell their coffee parchment humid the following day after it was just washed. Farmers lose a lot from their total net weight of their selling lot because of having to compensate for the ratio of wet coffee to dry parchment coffee. Dry parchment green coffee needs to be in the range of 12% to 14% humidity, but when the coffee its sold humid at around 80% humidity the difference in the humidity percentages gets deducted, leaving a small, hard earned profit to the farmer. There are a lot of drying concrete patios in this village but it looks like they were used at some point in the past and now they are not being used at all. I have never mentioned these issues to locals, but now I’m more prepared and ready to approach the processing stages with them so they can yield better earnings. I will start approaching them and introduce them to specialty coffee, their process and the possibilities to earn more income by following a stricter coffee processing method. This village has a lot of potential for their coffee because of the altitude which ranges from 1200 to 1700 meters above sea level. This village also has a very lush tropical environment in every direction, making it an ideal setting for highly sought after specialty coffee.</p>

The coffee mill, drying raised beds and drying solar house will be the beginning of a journey that brings hands-on equipment to local farmers interested in learning how to process specialty coffee and helps them to master new skills. This needs a lot of commitment from local coffee farmers, supporters and myself, and all I can promise you is that I will do my best to help them achieve the intended goal. my financial goal its 7,000 dollars (US) which would be enough to complete the mentioned infrastructure...all Supporters who help us meet this $7000 goal will have priority for requesting bulk coffee purchase from these local farmers.

Refined Sugars are now even being considered a drug due to their addictive nature. Most Refined Sugars are also high on the glycemic index and can cause large spikes in blood sugar, so they are not considered healthy for people, especially those with Diabetes. In addition to not using any artificial or synthetic sweeteners, Bare Life only uses all natural, low-glycemic index sweeteners that have been shown to not cause drastic blood sugar spikes.<br/><br/>We are Egg Yolk and Yeast Free because these ingredients are high-FODMAP, or high in short-chained carbohydrates which are difficult for our small intestine to absorb. High-FODMAP foods are not good for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or digestive disorders. All of our foods and recipes are also free of Xanthan gum. An extremely common additive in gluten free foods that acts as a binder, Xanthan Gum causes intestinal upset. So, we do not use this binder. Lastly, all of our ingredients are Organic, Non-GMO &amp; Kosher.</p><p> </p><h2>Our Community and Who We Are</h2><ul>

<li>60 - 70 million Americans are affected by digestive disorders.</li>
<li>In total, approximately 100 million Americans follow restrictive diets or eat allergen-free foods.</li>
</ul><p>Bare Life foods and recipes come from our founder, Ali, and her life with chronic illnesses including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Hashimoto's Disease, Thyroid Cancer and Lyme Disease and its Co-Infections. With these conditions came dietary restrictions. Exploring and trying popular diets, Ali could not find one that worked for her body.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“The Paleo diet, a diet for autoimmune conditions, was the first diet I looked into. It would have worked, but it includes many high-FODMAP ingredients, like egg yolks, yeast, spices, sugar alcohols and date sugar, which are bad for people with IBS.  Even the Low-FODMAP diet, the diet for people with IBS, wasn’t perfect because it includes dairy. No specific diet worked for me so through a lot of trial and error, I created Bare Life.

Our foods are: Organic, Non-GMO, Kosher, Dairy Free, Gluten Free, Refined Sugar Free, Yeast Free, and Xanthan Gum Free. Many of our foods and recipes are also Vegan, Paleo and Low-FODMAP friendly. You will be able to find Bare Life's foods online, in grocery stores and in your local coffee shop. Our first product is a treat, a Dairy Free and Refined Sugar Free Hot Cocoa powder that is also Vegan, Low-FODMAP and Paleo friendly. Our Hot CocoaBare Life's Kosher, Dairy Free and Refined Sugar Free Hot Cocoa powder has only five ingredients: Organic Coconut Milk Powder, Organic Coconut Sugar, Organic Unsweetened Cocoa Powder, Organic Vanilla Bean Powder, and Organic Salt.We use coconut milk powder without casein, so our Hot Cocoa is completely dairy free. We use coconut sugar as a sweetener because it’s unrefined and low on the glycemic index. And all of our ingredients are Organic and Non-GMO. Our Hot Cocoa is also Vegan, Paleo, Keto, and Kosher. And, again, all you need to add is hot water to make this body-friendly treat.Our Foods and RecipesOur Foods and Recipes are easy to digest and will be your body’s ally because they are: Dairy Free, Gluten Free, Refined Sugar Free, Yeast Free, Egg Yolk Free and Xanthan Gum Free. They are also Low-FODMAP, Low in Fat and Low in Insoluble Fiber. And the actually taste good!In addition to eliminating well-known allergens, Dairy and Gluten, Bare Life excludes Refined Sugar from our products. Refined Sugars are now even being considered a drug due to their addictive nature. Most Refined Sugars are also high on the glycemic index and can cause large spikes in blood sugar, so they are not considered healthy for people, especially those with Diabetes. In addition to not using any artificial or synthetic sweeteners, Bare Life only uses all natural, low-glycemic index sweeteners that have been shown to not cause drastic blood sugar spikes.We are Egg Yolk and Yeast Free because these ingredients are high-FODMAP, or high in short-chained carbohydrates which are difficult for our small intestine to absorb. High-FODMAP foods are not good for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or digestive disorders. All of our foods and recipes are also free of Xanthan gum. An extremely common additive in gluten free foods that acts as a binder, Xanthan Gum causes intestinal upset. So, we do not use this binder. Lastly, all of our ingredients are Organic, Non-GMO & Kosher. Our Community and Who We Are
133 million Americans or 40% of the population live with chronic illness, and even more are affected by them. Often people with chronic illnesses follow restrictive diets.
60 - 70 million Americans are affected by digestive disorders.
In total, approximately 100 million Americans follow restrictive diets or eat allergen-free foods.
Bare Life foods and recipes come from our founder, Ali, and her life with chronic illnesses including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Hashimoto's Disease, Thyroid Cancer and Lyme Disease and its Co-Infections. With these conditions came dietary restrictions. Exploring and trying popular diets, Ali could not find one that worked for her body.“The Paleo diet, a diet for autoimmune conditions, was the first diet I looked into. It would have worked, but it includes many high-FODMAP ingredients, like egg yolks, yeast, spices, sugar alcohols and date sugar, which are bad for people with IBS.  Even the Low-FODMAP diet, the diet for people with IBS, wasn’t perfect because it includes dairy. No specific diet worked for me so through a lot of trial and error, I created Bare Life. Bare Life foods are Gluten Free, Dairy Free and Refined Sugar Free, Yeast Free, Xanthan Gum Free as well as being Low-FODMAP, Non-GMO and Organic.”Bare Life is going to make these healthy foods easily accessible, whether it’s online, or in your local coffee shop or grocery store. Our plan begins with a treat, Hot Cocoa, and then we plan to create dry baking mixes and ultimately frozen meals. We will also be publishing two cookbooks with Bare Life recipes: Sweets (Desserts) and Thanksgiving. Eating healthily needs to be convenient and our mission is to make that happen. What We Need and What You GetWe are looking to raise $55,000 for a 2,000 unit production run of our Hot Cocoa packaged in 16 oz jars and single-serving packets, our cookbooks: Sweets and Thanksgiving, and for the launch of Bare Life. Please see our pie chart below for a detailed explanation of each expense category.50% or $27,500 of our goal is going towards production costs including co-packing, labeling and packaging. Our jars and single-serving packets will be sourced from ethical suppliers; Our ingredients labels and nutrition labels will meet all FDA regulations and legal food-labeling requirements. Our co-packer will be an FDA-registered facility licensed to pack our ingredients into jars and single-serving packets, ensuring quality control which online retailers like Amazon and grocery stores expect. 20% or $11,000 of our goal is for our Hot Cocoa ingredients. We will source our ingredients from high quality suppliers whose facilities share our values, so our customers will know the origin of their foods. 15% or $8,250 is for certifications, including Organic, Non-GMO, Kosher, Gluten-Free & Dairy-Free, and certified-lab expiration & nutritional content testing. 10% or $5,500 is for our company’s insurance policies. The final 5% or $2,750 will go towards printing costs for Bare Life's Sweets and Thanksgiving cookbooks.Crowdfunding is how we build awareness and gain support from customers who believe in our business and love the allergen-free and irritant-free concept behind our foods and recipes. In return, we thank supporters with perks including exclusive, pre-order Hot Cocoa kits, advanced copies of our cookbooks, and more. Even if our funding goal isn't met, we guarantee you will receive the perk you ordered! Other Ways You Can Support UsShare our story and campaign with friends, family and people you know living with chronic illness!

<h3>A Little About Us</h3>
<p>Our mission is to provide a fun and delightful experience by creating a delicious cool treat for folks of all ages to enjoy. Doesn’t everyone deserve to feel like a kid again?</p>
<p>Our pops are made from locally sourced market fresh ingredients. Quality is of utmost importance. Our flavor profiles encompass a wide range of taste. We are confident we have a flavor for you.</p>
<p>We believe in keeping it simple. We do not hide the flavor of natural fruit, so we never use High Fructose Corn Syrup or artificial flavors. Our fruity (vegan) pops contain whole fruit, herbs, and organic cane sugar. That’s it! All under 100 calories, some as low as 40 calories a pop.</p>
<p>Our creamy options are decadent with an average calorie count around 150 per pop. Our most popular flavors are Burnt Butter Brownie and Dark Chocolate Sea Salt. Let’s not forget to mention customer favorites Coffee &amp; Donuts and Banana Pudding.</p>
<p>If you are over 21 years of age… Listen up! Boozy pops pack a punch with each pop containing a 7.5% ABV. We make these a little different - No Stick! Boozy pops are packaged in pop sleeves which makes them perfect for freezing at home. Our alcohol infused pops are made with 100% whole fruit and top shelf liquor, including flavors such as Salted Watermelon Tequila, Peach Honey Bourbon, &amp; Lemon Drop Vodka.  Perfect for pool parties or a day at the beach! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where we need your help!</h3>
<p>The number one question we are asked is “Where can I buy your pops?</p>
<p>We have a unique opportunity to partner with a national retailer and bring our pops to a store near you.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the expansion opportunity, we need packaging to meet retail guidelines which will require the design and labeling of our products.</p>
<p>Our cost broken down below:</p>
<p>- Artwork Design of Packaging (Boozy and Non Alcoholic): $1,750</p>
<p>- Packaging (Includes custom printed plastic film, custom boxes): $13,380</p>
<p>- Display Freezers for our retailers ($600 each)</p>
<p>- Automated Equipment to help increase productivity and efficiency ($5,000 - $10,000) </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We started small, in a roughly 200 square foot kitchen, which limited any possibility for growth. We have since built out our own production facility. We designed the layout and interiors ourselves. We also did most of the work between construction, dealing with the health department, and getting all the equipment in place. It was truly a team effort to bring the facility alive. Today you can find KICPOPS at hundreds of local events and festivals each year, as well as all the Landry’s destination locations such as the Kemah Boardwalk and Historic Pleasure Pier.  </p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will help bring KICPOPS to more customers around the state.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our major challenge will be scaling the production of our product to fill orders in a timely manner. The good news is our production facility is already fully operational with the capacity for growth, providing us with the ability to scale. Purchasing power is a major challenge when it comes to a small business which we hope to alleviate with the help of this campaign.</p>

STRETCH GOAL: If I hit $2,500, I will be able to rent space in a commercial kitchen which will help me sell at a  much wider variety of events and markets. Also, everyone who pledges will receive an LABC car magnet! 
What's the deal?
I got the idea for Los Angeles Bun Company after having an incredible Filipino breakfast with a friend at L.A. Rose Cafe. The owner sat and chatted with us about a late night snack he'd make as a boy in the Philippines - a sardine bun with pandesal dough. His description was scrumptious, and I immediately tried to create it at home. As I baked, I thought about how wonderful it is that almost every culture has their own version of a bun or dumpling.

<h3>About the Coffee</h3>
<p>Here at Little Lady Coffee we use only the best South American beans to create our delightful Vienna Roast.

Why we need your help?
 
Our team has been diligently refining the Selffee concept and experience over the past year. We have been working closely with our manufacturers bringing this technology to life. Your candid feedback about our products are paramount to our growth. 
 
With your support we can attain a permanent location, which will serve as a storefront and office in New York City. The storefront will also act as a launch pad for special events, pop-ups and will give us the space to fulfill e-comm orders. This will act as a flagship model, which we will replicate globally.
 
IG @Selff.eeHave we launched yet?Yes! We have been doing pop-ups, corporate events, weddings, birthday parties, and special events in New York City for the past 6 months. Currently we have numerous gigs lined up for 2017 and the interest is increasing. With the support from this campaign it will help to spread Selffee throughout the nation.Why does Selffee work?Let’s not get it twisted; your face on a coffee, cookie, or cupcake is hilarious. Selffee is the perfect gift. In today’s world of Facebook, Instagram, selfies and food porn, Selffee brings photography and food together in a unique and visionary way. The Edible Photo Booth is the hottest new experience at special events. Selffee is perfect for corporate events, birthday parties, weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs or any other special occasion. How is this different from images I have seen on birthday cakes?Traditional cake transfer techniques cannot be printed live at events. They use an edible icing sheet with the image printed on it that alters the taste and texture of the consumable. Selffee's speed and image quality enables us to print live, on-site, at special events.Why have Selffee at your next event?95 percent of attendees and customers take a photo with their Selffee and post it to social media.

<p><strong>Sharp knives are expensive and very high-maintenance. </strong></p>
<p>And great design? Well, those knives get impractically futuristic. </p>
<p>We want to change that, so we created a knife that pairs a simple design with advanced metal technology.</p>
<p>Made of powder steel and coated in a titanium mirror-finish, it looks sharp, and it stays sharp.</p>

<p>The best part? It doesn’t require any special care, and an occasional home sharpening will go a long way, no matter what you put it through (have a look at the sharpness test below). Just show up and do what you do best: cooking. And it will make you and your kitchen look great, too.</p>

<p>When we started looking for a great knife for my kitchen, we were disappointed: they either looked good OR they performed well, and they were often prohibitively expensive. </p>
<p>The ones that focused on design, were almost useless in the kitchen, often having uber-futuristic shapes that compromised on handling abilities (as well as the blade’s material and sharpness).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576507441/fml3lam0nc5xdd9mmygi.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>That's why our knives are made of Matrix powder steel (similar to SG2 and M390 powder steel). The body is polished and coated in titanium. This gives it a minimal, awe-inspiring look that combines simplicity and raw power.</p>

<p><strong>Easy maintenance and bacteria resistant. Comfortable unibody grip for safety and precision.</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to go back to basics and rethink the knife: reach uncompromising performance while combining great usability and a timeless design.</p>
<p>We stripped away legacy features like the unhygienic wooden handle and created <strong>a unibody piece that feels great in your hand and looks great to your eye.</strong></p>
<p>Getting rid of a bulky, high-maintenance wooden handle also meant creating an object that is easier to clean and maintain.</p>
<p>The titanium coating provides antibacterial properties to the knife, while the design removes any receptacle for dirt to get stuck in. And the blade…will stay sharp for a very long time, effortlessly.</p>

<p><strong>When we set out to create a new kind of knife, that would combine uncompromising performance, minimal maintenance, affordability, and a modern look, we knew we had to start by thinking beyond traditional materials.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Breaking the sharp vs durable compromise</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to choosing the best steel for a knife, the biggest challenge is to balance higher hardness while maintaining strength: when one goes up, the other goes down, due to the process of steelmaking.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576478430/frihuhathmsju5bmkm5c.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>On one hand, top chefs still use high-carbon steel knives: their high hardness (HRC60+) is the key to superior sharpness and great durability. </p>
<p>Traditionally, this comes at a cost: the sharpest knives are also fragile and brittle, requiring high-maintenance for the blade and special care to deal with the high sensitivity to humidity, acid, and rust. High carbon knives are usually very expensive ($800+). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576478491/awuboeglylb4g28ascey.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>On the other hand, consumer knives that use more resistant steel alloys don’t require as much special care, are harder, and much more rust-resistant. However, this comes at a cost too: they’re never really as sharp as they should be (even just out of the box).</p>
<p>This is why (traditional) steel knives always come at a compromise between sharpness and durability. Until powder steel knives are made, loved by top chefs but very pricy, (A chef knife made of SG2 powder steel costs more than $300.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576478559/ead4utsgou5sssz5pfoy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Powder steel is made in a very different way than casting, a process invented by NASA. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576478680/e5ufilb6qlmphticvyc3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When we set out to create an uncompromising knife for every kitchen, we tested different materials, until we found the perfect one: Matrix powder steel (Similar to SG2). This powder steel combines and balances its different properties, so much so that it is also used to make bearings for modern windmills. Matrix powder steel is specially engineered for a great balance of high hardness (HRC62) and high yield strength.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576478767/uyt6t7y9ovbvjkx4ym6u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With the state of the art machines and lab-precision engineering (SLS), Matrix powder steel is then combined with stainless steel to form blades of high hardness, high yield strength and great corrosion resistance.  This makes our knives exceptionally sharp, extremely durable, and accessible to every kitchen.</p>

Sharp knives are expensive and very high-maintenance. 
And great design? Well, those knives get impractically futuristic. 
We want to change that, so we created a knife that pairs a simple design with advanced metal technology.
Made of powder steel and coated in a titanium mirror-finish, it looks sharp, and it stays sharp.

The best part? It doesn’t require any special care, and an occasional home sharpening will go a long way, no matter what you put it through (have a look at the sharpness test below). Just show up and do what you do best: cooking. And it will make you and your kitchen look great, too.

 

 
TheChefClub knives are loved and approved by Michelin-starred chefs, as well as everyday home cooks.

 
Here’s how we combined design and tech to make the first uncompromising knife.

When we started looking for a great knife for my kitchen, we were disappointed: they either looked good OR they performed well, and they were often prohibitively expensive. 
The ones that focused on design, were almost useless in the kitchen, often having uber-futuristic shapes that compromised on handling abilities (as well as the blade’s material and sharpness).

 
That's why our knives are made of Matrix powder steel (similar to SG2 and M390 powder steel). The body is polished and coated in titanium. This gives it a minimal, awe-inspiring look that combines simplicity and raw power.
 Every detail has been thought out for precise use and playful cooking: from the comfortable extended grip to the round blade tail, keeping the sharp edge further away from your fingers for safer operation. 
Easy maintenance and bacteria resistant. Comfortable unibody grip for safety and precision.
We wanted to go back to basics and rethink the knife: reach uncompromising performance while combining great usability and a timeless design.
We stripped away legacy features like the unhygienic wooden handle and created a unibody piece that feels great in your hand and looks great to your eye.
Getting rid of a bulky, high-maintenance wooden handle also meant creating an object that is easier to clean and maintain.
The titanium coating provides antibacterial properties to the knife, while the design removes any receptacle for dirt to get stuck in. And the blade…will stay sharp for a very long time, effortlessly.

 
Easy maintenance and bacteria resistant. 

 

By stripping away unnecessary elements, we created a timeless knife set to celebrate your moments of cooking. 
The soft lines and round finishing give a sense of playfulness that will make cooking a pleasant and recharging moment for yourself (or to share with others). 

It complements your dishes and complements your kitchen. The smooth and ergonomic shape is pleasant to the eye and extremely comfortable in the hand. 
TheChefClub knives blend in with any kitchen and complement its style, making a statement of your style and creativity.

 
The set includes a paring, utility, chef, Santoku, boning, and bread knife.
 

 

When we set out to create a new kind of knife, that would combine uncompromising performance, minimal maintenance, affordability, and a modern look, we knew we had to start by thinking beyond traditional materials.

Breaking the sharp vs durable compromise
When it comes to choosing the best steel for a knife, the biggest challenge is to balance higher hardness while maintaining strength: when one goes up, the other goes down, due to the process of steelmaking.

On one hand, top chefs still use high-carbon steel knives: their high hardness (HRC60+) is the key to superior sharpness and great durability. 
Traditionally, this comes at a cost: the sharpest knives are also fragile and brittle, requiring high-maintenance for the blade and special care to deal with the high sensitivity to humidity, acid, and rust. High carbon knives are usually very expensive ($800+). 

On the other hand, consumer knives that use more resistant steel alloys don’t require as much special care, are harder, and much more rust-resistant. However, this comes at a cost too: they’re never really as sharp as they should be (even just out of the box).
This is why (traditional) steel knives always come at a compromise between sharpness and durability. Until powder steel knives are made, loved by top chefs but very pricy, (A chef knife made of SG2 powder steel costs more than $300.

Powder steel is made in a very different way than casting, a process invented by NASA. 

When we set out to create an uncompromising knife for every kitchen, we tested different materials, until we found the perfect one: Matrix powder steel (Similar to SG2). This powder steel combines and balances its different properties, so much so that it is also used to make bearings for modern windmills. Matrix powder steel is specially engineered for a great balance of high hardness (HRC62) and high yield strength.

With the state of the art machines and lab-precision engineering (SLS), Matrix powder steel is then combined with stainless steel to form blades of high hardness, high yield strength and great corrosion resistance.  This makes our knives exceptionally sharp, extremely durable, and accessible to every kitchen.

 
TheChefClub knives are coated with Titanium (PVD coating) for a harder surface, superior resistant to corrosion,anti-bacterial, and…sharp looking.
By using innovative materials and redesigning the knife to make it out of the same single piece, we created an uncompromising knife: sharp in performance, sharp in style, and with very little need for maintenance.

TheChefClub outperforms premium knives over $150. 



TheChefClub knives are engineered to maintain good sharpness with no need of professional sharpening. 
We take full advantage of Matrix powder steel's ultra hardness (HRC62), high yield strength and flexibility of engineering to make the perfect blades for sensational cutting:


 
In the Catra test, TheChefClub chef knife is 24% sharper, 37% more durable than SHUN, and 117% more durable than Wusthof.


Our chefs love cooking with the knife, but we still wanted to put it to the ultimate test and put it through the extreme dull test: cutting a strong hemp rope. In fact, we put it to the test against a $150 Zwilling knife. Here’s what happened:
After 240 cuts, TheChefClub chef knife can still slice a tomato effortlessly.
  Available in 3 finishes: stainless (matte), stainless (glossy),  black (PVD TI), and gold (PVD TI). Our full set of knives is made of Matrix powder steel, combining opposing metal properties like high yield strength and ultra hardness, making our knives incredibly sharp and low maintenance at the same time.Rinse for thorough cleaning: dishwasher-safe for next level hygienic: no odor, stain and fungal. The PVD Titanium coating and fine surface treatment provide extra resistance to corrosion, stains, smells, dirt, and bacteria.TheChefClub knives are made with a very precise and controlled process. With 3D modeling and strict production control, we are able to adjust the handle’s weight to the different blades to achieve the ideal balance.The extended handle offers extra support, and the smooth ergonomic form makes it extremely comfortable to hold.TheChefClub knives are designed with no corners for stains and bacteria to hide. The round blade tail shifts the sharp edge further away for safer operation.Thanks to a perfected fusion of design and technology, our knives are uncompromising from the way they look and feel, all the way to the way they cut and perform.Featured by Chef Lorious: ""I really like TheChefClub's knives.

<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>Mijn naam is Filip Linthout en samen met mijn partner Ingrid, beiden gepassioneerd door alles wat met distilleren te maken heeft, zijn we eind 2017 een nieuw avontuur begonnen. We zijn toen begonnen met het opzetten van een kleine distilleerderij in de gebouwen achter onze woning en met een zelfgemaakte koperen stookketel gingen we aan de slag, in een vorig leven was ik namelijk ook nog metaalbewerker en lasser.</p>
<p>En toen was het zover, ons eerste product, onze Kopermans-gin, was geboren.</p>

<p>The world’s slowest drinker, that’s who. The real problem with drinking from a naked pint glass doesn't happen in hours, but rather in just a few minutes. That's how fast a beer can become undrinkable in a naked pint glass.</p>

</div></div>","Cold Beer For Up To Two Hours: Say goodbye to warm beer for good!

Sleek Design: Finally a coozie that doesn’t look like it’s from the lost & found. 

Durable Construction: Made from high quality kitchen grade stainless steel.

Sweat Proof: Your hands will stay bone dry.

Built-In Coaster: A soft yet durable bottom means you'll never need a coaster again.

Chill Pill Adds More Chill: Drop one in before your pint glass for even more chill!

Also A Stand Alone Imperial Pint: No glass? No problem.

Great for Hot Drinks Too: Snap on the lid and keep your hot stuff hot.



The world’s slowest drinker, that’s who. The real problem with drinking from a naked pint glass doesn't happen in hours, but rather in just a few minutes. That's how fast a beer can become undrinkable in a naked pint glass.
Beer is meant to be served (and consumed) in a relatively small temperature window, depending upon its style. Most range from 5 to 10 degrees. 
A beer's flavor profile is built upon a delicate balance between the forces of hot and cold as heat magnifies certain flavor components, while cold subdues them. As a beer grows warmer, it naturally loses that balance and thus becomes less and less tasty.

The clock starts ticking on flavor loss the moment that your beer is poured. If you don't hurry, you may miss out on that perfect flavor window in just a few minutes!
Traditional coozies provide little to no insulation for your drink. Beyond adding a touch of personality, they don’t do much more than keep your warm hand from touching the cold beer. And frankly, that’s just not enough. As lovers of deliciously cold beer, heat is our mortal enemy. And it is our duty to eliminate it.


CHILLOOZIE is made of two layers of stainless steel separated by a vacuum seal, which will help maintain your beverages temperature and will never sweat. Its dual-wall technology forms a vacuum barrier between your drink and the outside temperature, enabling your drink to stay at its ideal drinking temperature for hours on end. Most likely even longer than it ever takes for you to drink it.

<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>ABOUT </em></strong><strong><em>ME</em></strong>:</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Jerry DesChaux, for 25 years I was employed as an IT Computer Professional on several different levels to include computer operations, production support, programming, and management utilizing IBM mainframes.  Somewhere after the turn of the century, the IBM mainframes were quickly replaced with the current day client servers. The client server is at the other end of the spectrum on how they function/operate. Needless to say, I was blind-sided by technology, and like tens and thousands of other people in this career field, I was out-sourced. From there I was employed as a drain tech/plumber, then on to driving an 18 wheeler. After several years of driving, I started having problems with my physical ability to get up and down onto the big trucks. This brings us pretty close to present day.</p>
<p>On February 07, 2012, I was admitted to the hospital weighing 317 lbs., in pretty bad condition and could barely put any weight on my left leg and my calves were 28 inches around. Bright and early the next morning the test started.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, I had a previous heart attack I didn't even know I had, kidney problems, liver problems, and my heart was enlarged trying to keep up with the other organs. I also had blood clots that formed in my legs and traveled to my lungs. This was all in the 1st week in the hospital. Then the doctors tell me my lymph nodes in my groin area are swollen 3 to 4 times their normal size, we need to do a biopsy. The test results showed I have lymphoma, now we need to do a biopsy of your bone marrow to see if the lymphoma is there as well. Low and behold, there it was, in my bone marrow as well.</p>
<p>So, 18 days later, I checked out of the hospital, legs normal size, 245 lbs., kidneys ok, liver ok, heart size reduced, lymph nodes a little swollen, and I am on 5 medications for life. Lymphoma/leukemia is in a stage where no treatment is necessary, and my doctor assured me that I may never need treatment (got my fingers crossed). I have been keeping the weight off to date, and I feel good about life.</p>
<p>Folks, I am not sure what life's destiny has in store for me, but I sure am thankful to still be alive for a while longer, hopefully for many years to come. I have been out of work now since December of 2010. I have done quite a lot of research for the Denver metro area in the KETTLE CORN business, I see an opportunity, and I plan to take full advantage of it.</p>
<p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong> Kettle Corn History</strong></p>
<p>So, exactly who invented KETTLE CORN? Good question. One thing for sure, it's been popped for decades and only grows in popularity! Supposedly, the farmers and cowboys of the old Mid-West used to make their own version of KETTLE CORN. After a day of harvest, they would throw rendered fat into a cast iron pot sitting over the fire. When the fat was hot, they'd throw in some corn kernels and whatever sweetener available, usually honey or molasses. Cooking methods may have changed with the times, but KETTLE CORN still has that same slightly sweet, slightly salty taste we're all addicted to.</p>
<p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center;""> <em><strong>Americans today consume 17 billion quarts of popped popcorn each year. The average American eats about 58 quarts.</strong></em></p>
<p>KETTLE CORN popularity has grown in leaps and bounds over the years. KETTLE CORN is a great delicious snack item that is full of fiber and rich in flavor that most folks find addictive. Most of the time, folks just have a hard time finding good quality freshly popped ‘KETTLE CORN’. Those who are popcorn connoisseurs know this to be true. During my research on the KETTLE CORN business in my local area, I have found only a few businesses are claiming to be producing and selling KETTLE CORN style popcorn. So far, I haven’t found 1 business that makes real KETTLE CORN style popcorn and I have 4 more to check out.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to produce the best gourmet KETTLE CORN in the Denver metro area of Colorado. My campaign on this website is to obtain the necessary funding for first class NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) certified equipment so i can produce the best gourmet KETTLE CORN. I am seeking $33,950.00 to fulfill my monetary needs. I will outline my campaign to show where and how the campaign funds will be utilized, include pictures of equipment being purchased by campaign funds, frequent updates and other information pertinent to my campaign.</p>
<p>Below is what your donations to my campaign will purchase and start what will become a lucrative business venture.</p>
<p>Complete Mobile Concession Package features:</p>
<p>■NSF certified 160 Qt. Kettle Corn Popping Machine &amp; NSF Certified Sifting Bin</p>
<p>■E-Z UP Canopy Package - Includes tent 10’ x 10’, solid back wall, two screened sidewalls &amp; custom printing (i will be up-grading to a larger canopy).</p>
<p>■Service/Storage Counter</p>
<p>■Customized Magnetic Sign for your service counter. This sign can be moved to your trailer or vehicle for down-the-road advertising. </p>
<p>■Ingredient Counter with built-in hand washing sink - Includes 3 ingredient storage bins with lids. </p>
<p>■Popping Accessories  </p>
<p>■Recipes, Manual &amp; Training Video</p>
<p>■Unlimited support</p>
<p>                 sub-total = $8499.00</p>
<p>■Upgrade to a 10' x 20' canopy, add $450.00</p>
<p>■ Handmade Rustic Pricing Sign, add $75.00</p>
<p>■ Sky Banner &amp; frame Mounts directly to your EZ UP canopy frame - be seen from a distance, add $299.00</p>
<p>$9323.00 = entire concession package NSF certified, professional appearance and equipment. Equipment pictures will follow:</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DISBURSEMENT OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Full Concession kettle corn equipment:         $9400.00</p>
<p>Concession trailer:                                             7500.00</p>
<p>Supplies:                                                             2700.00</p>
<p>Taxes, licenses, insurance,</p>
<p>trailer hitch, storage:                                          3000.00</p>
<p>Website, business cards, advertising:             1500.00</p>
<p>Wages for 4 employees for 4 wks:                   6400.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            TOTAL:          APPROXIMATELY         $30,500.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All figures are approximates and there may be additional unforeseen monetary requirements (concession event fees, employees, etc). All campaign funds will be used in conjunction with my monetary needs for business equipment, any left-over funds will be used to further expand the business needs. If the full amount of the campaign is not reached, the funds will be applied to purchase the concession trailer first for storage purposes of KETLE CORN popping equipment. Other means of funding for other equipment will be sought out. Most events or a worksite that is permanent the product will be produced in the confines of the concession trailer. The canopy will be used when the concession trailer is not allowed at an event. In the event I decide to go mail order with the KETTLE CORN product from my website, I already have a mailing service arranged. </p>

Hello, my name is Jerry DesChaux, for 25 years I was employed as an IT Computer Professional on several different levels to include computer operations, production support, programming, and management utilizing IBM mainframes.  Somewhere after the turn of the century, the IBM mainframes were quickly replaced with the current day client servers. The client server is at the other end of the spectrum on how they function/operate. Needless to say, I was blind-sided by technology, and like tens and thousands of other people in this career field, I was out-sourced. From there I was employed as a drain tech/plumber, then on to driving an 18 wheeler. After several years of driving, I started having problems with my physical ability to get up and down onto the big trucks. This brings us pretty close to present day.
On February 07, 2012, I was admitted to the hospital weighing 317 lbs., in pretty bad condition and could barely put any weight on my left leg and my calves were 28 inches around. Bright and early the next morning the test started.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, I had a previous heart attack I didn't even know I had, kidney problems, liver problems, and my heart was enlarged trying to keep up with the other organs. I also had blood clots that formed in my legs and traveled to my lungs. This was all in the 1st week in the hospital. Then the doctors tell me my lymph nodes in my groin area are swollen 3 to 4 times their normal size, we need to do a biopsy. The test results showed I have lymphoma, now we need to do a biopsy of your bone marrow to see if the lymphoma is there as well. Low and behold, there it was, in my bone marrow as well.
So, 18 days later, I checked out of the hospital, legs normal size, 245 lbs., kidneys ok, liver ok, heart size reduced, lymph nodes a little swollen, and I am on 5 medications for life. Lymphoma/leukemia is in a stage where no treatment is necessary, and my doctor assured me that I may never need treatment (got my fingers crossed). I have been keeping the weight off to date, and I feel good about life.
Folks, I am not sure what life's destiny has in store for me, but I sure am thankful to still be alive for a while longer, hopefully for many years to come. I have been out of work now since December of 2010. I have done quite a lot of research for the Denver metro area in the KETTLE CORN business, I see an opportunity, and I plan to take full advantage of it.
 Kettle Corn History
So, exactly who invented KETTLE CORN? Good question. One thing for sure, it's been popped for decades and only grows in popularity! Supposedly, the farmers and cowboys of the old Mid-West used to make their own version of KETTLE CORN. After a day of harvest, they would throw rendered fat into a cast iron pot sitting over the fire. When the fat was hot, they'd throw in some corn kernels and whatever sweetener available, usually honey or molasses. Cooking methods may have changed with the times, but KETTLE CORN still has that same slightly sweet, slightly salty taste we're all addicted to.
 Americans today consume 17 billion quarts of popped popcorn each year. The average American eats about 58 quarts.
KETTLE CORN popularity has grown in leaps and bounds over the years. KETTLE CORN is a great delicious snack item that is full of fiber and rich in flavor that most folks find addictive. Most of the time, folks just have a hard time finding good quality freshly popped ‘KETTLE CORN’. Those who are popcorn connoisseurs know this to be true. During my research on the KETTLE CORN business in my local area, I have found only a few businesses are claiming to be producing and selling KETTLE CORN style popcorn. So far, I haven’t found 1 business that makes real KETTLE CORN style popcorn and I have 4 more to check out.
What I Need & What You Get
My goal is to produce the best gourmet KETTLE CORN in the Denver metro area of Colorado. My campaign on this website is to obtain the necessary funding for first class NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) certified equipment so i can produce the best gourmet KETTLE CORN. I am seeking $33,950.00 to fulfill my monetary needs. I will outline my campaign to show where and how the campaign funds will be utilized, include pictures of equipment being purchased by campaign funds, frequent updates and other information pertinent to my campaign.
Below is what your donations to my campaign will purchase and start what will become a lucrative business venture.

Since then, Goose Island has been a leader in the industry and the team has created award-winning beers that define classic and innovative styles. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant to keep up with demand. The brewery has since doubled in size and now includes a 143,000 square foot barrel aging warehouse that is home to the famous Bourbon County brand stouts and other experimental projects. We shot this interview with brewer Reed Schwenger inside this massive warehouse and we were very impressed!</p><div data-href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SisheVUOw5o""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/SisheVUOw5o?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>The next stop on our brewery tour was Mispillion River Brewing, which opened in Milford, Delaware in the fall of 2013.

They aim to honor craft brewing by using the highest quality ingredients, and they strive for the best customer service in the industry.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why can’t I just drink beer straight from the bottle or can?</strong></p>
<ul><li>We believe beer is liquid art and deserves to be respected and consumed the way brewmasters intended. Just as one would never drink wine or spirits straight from the bottle, it’s highly recommended to pour beer into proper glassware to release its full potential and maximize aroma and flavor.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Can’t I just simply pour my beer into a glass to generate foam?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Yes and no. A hand pour provides mechanical agitation that will create foam of randomly packed bubbles of non-uniform shapes and size that will occupy more space and, thus, are inherently less dense and frothy. Only Fizzics™ technology eliminates unsightly, bloated bubbles that contribute to foam collapse. Our device packs small, dense bubbles to preserve the flavors in beer while providing a wonderful mouthfeel of creamy, wet foam.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Why is foam important?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Foam is an integral part of beer quality and the overall beer-drinking experience. Foam is visually appealing, enhances the aroma, flavor &amp; mouthfeel of beer and is expected by all serious beer drinkers.</li></ul>
<p><strong>How does Waytap compare to other draft beer dispensers or Kegerators?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Most all beer systems are powered by a set of equipment (keg, faucet handle, tower, regulator, beer &amp; air lines, CO2 and nitrogen tanks) that must work together for a successful pour. Waytap™ is a compact, personal system that utilizes the inherent properties of conditioned and commercially packaged beer. This, coupled with our patented technology, controls the pressure of CO2 that wants to come out of solution and influence both foam generation and beer head retention.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Can I use any bottles or cans or beverages other than beer?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Waytap serves a vast universe of macro and craft beers and is compatible with 12-25oz cans and 12oz bottles. Our system is optimized for beer. We encourage you to experiment!</li></ul>
<p><strong>How do you clean Waytap?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Cleaning Waytap is very easy. Run a glass of warm water to flush out the system. The lid can be removed to easily clean the inside of the system. The anti-microbial drip mat separates for easy rinsing and washing.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What types of beverages are compatible with Waytap?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Waytap is compatible with 12-25oz cans and 12oz bottles. It requires no expensive consumables or proprietary kegs or accessories. Whether it's an IPA, Hefeweizen, Pilsner, Brown Ale, or any other popular brew, Waytap will pour it perfectly.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Should my glass be cold?</strong></p>
<ul><li>While the can or bottle of beer you insert should always be cold, the temperature of your glass is up to you. We always recommend a freshly water-rinsed beer mug or glass, but for flavor’s sake, please don't freeze or frost your glass.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Should I hold my glass a certain way when pouring?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Tap the handle forward while holding the glass at a 45-degree angle, up to the spout of Waytap™ and begin the pour. When you are ready for the head (foam), hold the glass upright and push the handle backwards to top with the Fizzics Micro-Foam.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What kind of batteries does the Waytap use?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Waytap is powered by 4 standard AA batteries.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What’s special about a beer poured from Waytap?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Waytap provides an enhanced aroma, flavor and taste as well as a smooth &amp; creamy mouthfeel. Waytap is scientifically engineered, using patent-pending fluid &amp; gas technology to create an ultra-dense, long-lasting foam head. The technology that went into Waytap is both highly complex and strikingly simple. Waytap is easy to operate, portable and provides for an enhanced, balanced and sensational mouthfeel.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Are the materials in Waytap FDA approved?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Yes. All components are manufactured, assembled and packaged in a positive pressure Class 100 Clean Room environment that is regularly subjected to rigorous testing in order to meet the stringent requirements of the FDA. All resins are FDA approved food-grade materials and assembled using stainless steel hardware. Waytap is designed to comply with FDA, FCC, CE and RoHS standards and regulations.</li></ul>
<p><strong>When will the Waytap ship?</strong></p>
<ul><li>December 2016.</li></ul>
<p><strong>How is US shipping handled?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Please add $10 for domestic shipments (Waytap single pack)</li></ul>
<p><strong>How is international shipping handled?</strong></p>
<ul><li>International shipping does not include import regulations, payment of import duties and taxes. Please add $30 for international shipments (Waytap single pack). Please note, customers are responsible for any and all import taxes, duties, custom fees, etc.</li></ul>
<p>The package dimensions are as follows: <br/>Width: 7.625” <br/>Depth: 5” <br/>Height: 13.75” <br/>Weight: 3 lbs</p>
<p><strong>Can I cancel my pledge and/or get a refund?</strong></p>
<ul><li>We are unable to adjust pledge selections and contributions made on Indiegogo, they are non-refundable. Please note: All crowdsourcing purchases receive a manufacturer’s lifetime warranty.</li></ul>
<p><strong>How do I choose the color?</strong></p>

Missed the Waytap campaign?
Waytap is now available at  Fizzics.com! 
  Delicious Draft Beer at Home, with the Help of Science.  
 
 By leveraging sound waves, Fizzics Waytap converts the beer’s natural carbonation into densely compacted, uniform Micro-Foam™ bubbles unlocking the true taste of any beer, delivering the freshest, fullest flavor like the brewmaster intended.Place any bottle or can into your Waytap, pull down on the handle and sound waves instantly make denser bubbles, enriching texture and taste.   
Waytap maintains the carbonation in the body of the beer for the freshest taste while protecting your beer from degradation. 

 
 
Our patented Fizzics® Micro-Foam™ Technology leverages sound waves to convert the beer’s natural carbonation into densely compacted, uniform bubbles that enrich the texture and taste of your beer.  
 The foam creates a seal for the body of the beer, locking in the carbonation so the flavor stays fresh from the first sip to the last.
 

 
A year ago, we introduced Fizzics to the crowdfunding community and the response was incredible. But we didn’t stop there. Fizzics® Waytap™ comes in an even more portable size, making it easier than ever before to enjoy the fresh flavor of your favorite beers.


Our Original Fizzics got a lot of buzz. So we used the same Fizzics® Micro-Foam™ Technology and put it into our new Fizzics® Waytap™.
 

 
We’ve combined the functionality of a traditional bar tap with a contemporary design for the home, so Fizzics Waytap doesn’t just pour works of art—it looks like one, too.

 

 


 

 
 


 

Fizzics Waytap works with any can or bottle of beer, up to a 25 oz can or 12 oz bottle.  

Place the can or bottle in the chamber. Pull the tap for beer. Push the tap for foam.

So we shared our first product with dozens of passionate craftsmen who were grateful to see how we maintained the flavor and freshness of their product—just how they intended it.Brewmasters are some of the most knowledgeable men and women in the world when it comes to the aromas and flavors of beer. That’s why we brought them our Fizzics technology and let them experience for themselves how it unlocks that fresh-from-the-tap taste. In this ongoing video series, Fizzics Brewers Spotlight, we visit dozens of breweries around the country to highlight the passion of brewing, get behind the scenes insight into the beers they produce, and to hear just what brewers think of a beer poured with Fizzics Micro-Foam technology.  We begin with Weyerbacher Brewing headquartered in Easton, PA. Founded in 1995 as a brewpub in a livery stable in downtown Easton, Weyerbacher has since successfully grown to become a regional craft production brewery that many have come to know and love for their big, bold, flavorful beers. Weyerbacher celebrated their 21st anniversary this year and they now have a new 40 bbl brewhouse, a pilot system, an advanced lab, a large barrel aging program, and decades of combined brewing experience. Look out for some delicious new recipes coming out soon! Weyerbacher brewer Christian Mosebach loves using growlers and pouring witbiers and IPAs through the Fizzics Draft Beer System, saying it gives them a nitro sort of feel, and that it “really works!” Our next stop is Demented Brewing Company in Middlesex, NJ. This team of dedicated and talented brewers are known for putting out a variety of “insanely flavorful ales.” Their rustic building is home to a custom 10 bbl brewhouse, a small barrel aging program, and a tasting room covered in an elaborate, demonic mural. Their approach to brewing is very unique and often changes with consumer preferences, so look out for new and exciting beers on draft at all times! In this next video, we took the first generation Fizzics to the brewmasters at Lakefront Brewery and Dewey Beer Co., to get their thoughts on the Fizzics system.Evan Koepnick, Lead Brewer at Lakefront brewery, was a big fan of the Fizzics. Pouring one of his favorite beers from their brewery through the Fizzics, he said “all of a sudden it just came to a new level, and it’s like I found a new appreciation for it out of this Fizzics System.” Mike Reilly is the Cofounder and Brewmaster at Dewey Beer Co. and tried one of their dry-hopped IPAs in our first generation Fizzics, and said “the head really gives it that fragrance that I’m after all the time!” For our next stop we head to Amherst, Wisconsin to meet with head brewer Simon Nielsen at Central Waters Brewing Company. Founded in 1998 by two friends and homebrewers, the company has since grown out of its original brewhouse and building to meet demand throughout Wisconsin. They produce over 18 different beer styles each year and are home to the second biggest barrel aging program in the country. We shot this interview inside their huge barrel aging warehouse and got a chance to taste of some of their special offerings -- we were impressed! What do you get when you take a group of musicians and a passion for great beer, and then mix them together in the city by the sea? You get the Asbury Park Brewery, which is the next stop in our Brewers Spotlight’s series. Asbury Park, NJ is known around the world as the place where music lives: good times, great bands, and now world-class beer. The philosophy at Asbury Park brewery is to provide highly drinkable, approachable, and delicious brews to taproom patrons and local bars. We tested them all out on our visit and can confirm that these guys know what they are doing!

We definitely felt welcomed on our visit and we enjoyed a variety of excellent brews.  We launched our first product with the hopes that like-minded beer lovers would enjoy a fresher-tasting beer as much as we do. And they did.

<h3>We believe in good food and kindness for all.</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Kind Food and <strong>we have a dream of perpetuating kindness in our community (and beyond) by way of clean, delicious food and meaningful connections. </strong>If you're short on time, the bullets below summarize what we're about and why we're here. (Keep reading below the bullets for even more details.)</p>
<ul>
<li>We make <strong>really yummy food</strong> that is good for people and the planet. That means a 100% <strong>plant-based menu</strong>—fresh ingredients, mostly organic and locally sourced whenever possible.</li>
<li>We’re committed to building an <strong>earth friendly</strong> operation. Our packaging is compostable and recyclable, we use earth-conscious workflows in the kitchen, and do our best to manage our use of natural resources.</li>
<li>We strive to <strong>spread kindness</strong>—in our local community and around the world. That starts at the window and flows into supporting community causes, organizing volunteers, and being a voice and example in the industry.</li>
<li>We <strong>launched Kind Food in 2018</strong> as a pop-up concept and officially opened in the <a href=""http://www.feastmagazine.com/the-feed/kansas_city_news/article_83aa910a-f7e0-11e8-bc8d-dbbe1698c875.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iron District</a> in October 2019. We've been working hard to make this dream a reality--<strong>pouring our heart and soul </strong>into building something bigger than “just another eatery.”</li>
<li>So far, we’ve been able to <strong>partner with 13 charities</strong> to donate over $2,000 and help raise an additional $7,100 in monetary and item donations. This is truly only the beginning of our work in the community!</li>
<li>Since opening our location, we’ve received a ton of great feedback and <strong>experienced strong growth</strong>, despite the challenges presented by an outdoor venue in the Midwest winter. With winter margins naturally tighter, this growth plus our anticipated increase in business during the coming warmer days means <strong>we have an immediate need for extra working capital</strong>. Capital for things like <strong>inventory, additional cold storage and talented staff.</strong> That's where your support of this crowdfunding campaign comes in!</li>
<li>In addition, your support means we’re better positioned to implement various <strong>community fundraisers and initiatives more quickly and with greater impact</strong>. We have plans to partner with different local, national and global organizations ongoing throughout this year and your campaign support will help us do this much sooner and more effectively that we can on our own.</li>
<li>We have a <strong>range of great perks for you</strong> in exchange for your financial contribution! We're not asking you to give us something for nothing. No way. In fact, you can access several <strong>exclusive deals</strong> only available thru the campaign--even if you don't live in KC.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your support matters.</strong> We've only made it this far because you've shown up for us—at events, online and at the container.

<h3>More About Kind Food &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We passionately aim to perpetuate kindness—to others and the planet. Our food is 100% <strong>plant-based</strong>, and both locally-sourced and organic when available. Our food containers and utensils are <strong>environmentally friendly</strong> and compostable. We support <strong>community</strong> programs that encourage people-, animal- and earth-friendly practices. You can read more about <a href=""https://www.kindfoodkc.com/about-kind-food"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our guiding principles</a> on our website.</p>
<p>We launched in 2018 with the goal of bringing healthy, delicious food (and a healthy dose of compassion) to the growing plant-based, vegan and plant-curious community in Kansas City. After hosting 13 pop up events and catering hundreds of meals, we officially opened in our first full time location in October 2019 inside the Iron District in North Kansas City.</p>
<p>Our menu focuses on <strong>fresh, healthy ingredients</strong> and avoids highly processed foods or meat replacers. You'll find things like our signature <strong>Meta Burger</strong> (a house-made veggie patty made with plants and fairy dust—a crowd favorite!), messy and fulfilling <strong>nachos</strong>, warm and comforting veggie curry, the occasional biscuit and gravy or <strong>breakfast burrito</strong>, and a whole lot more. We offer many gluten-free options and carry a house oil-free dressing that is totally delicious!</p>

<p>Whether you're new to plant-based eating, a long-time vegan or a lunchtime adventurer looking to branch out, we think you'll enjoy our food and the experience. <strong>We want to prove that plant food is not only delicious and fulfilling, but can also make a huge impact on your health and the planet at the same time.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THAT KINDNESS STUFF..</strong></p>
<p>Our vision of spreading kindness in the world starts at the window and trickles into every aspect of our business. (Yes, sometimes we’re tired and awkward and make mistakes, but we strive to do our best each day.) <strong>We truly believe that love can change the world</strong> and that food is a great vehicle for spreading that stuff!</p>
<p>Even in the early stages of our formation and growth, we’ve made it a priority to build meaningful connections in the community and use our platform for good. So far, <strong>we’ve partnered with 13 different organizations</strong> (both local and global) including Kansas City Pig Rescue Network, Chain of Hope, KSMODA, KC Center for Inclusion, Care Beyond the Boulevard, Pets for Vets and others, to help raise funds and collect much needed donations.</p>
<p>We’re excited to continue growing our community involvement this year and to find new, meaningful ways to share our vision with others along the way.</p>

<h3>Why We've Turned to Crowdfunding</h3>
<p>Launching a startup food concept is truly meant for only the craziest of people! <strong>It’s a ton of hard work, full of ever-changing variables and worth every moment.</strong></p>
<p>We've been working really hard for more than a year to build something people are excited to support. <strong>We’ve invested our time, energy, passion, sleep and money</strong> into launching and growing Kind Food.</p>
<p>And, it’s paying off! We’re receiving a ton of great feedback, seeing <strong>strong growth </strong>despite the challenges presented by an outdoor venue in the Midwest winter, and setting our sights on the opportunities ahead. </p>
<p>The timing and size of <strong>this growth means we have an immediate need for extra working capital</strong> – for things like extra inventory, new equipment to streamline processes and increase output, and talented staff.</p>
<p>With winter margins being naturally tighter, <strong>we need your support </strong>to help us prepare for the growth of the busy season and all that lies ahead for Kind Food and our community projects this year.</p>
<p><strong><i>Enter:</i> crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p>What we love the most about this crowdfunding platform is that <strong>we are able to give you something in exchange for your support.</strong> We'd never ask you to give us something for nothing! You can help us out AND enjoy a fun reward while you’re at it. Learn more about our campaign perks in the featured list above/to the right.</p>
<p>We are determined to raise the capital we need to serve you well and grow the Kind Food vision this year. <strong>Will you help us reach our funding goal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>--</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; HOW WE'LL USE THE MONEY</strong></p>
<p>We're asking our supporters to help us raise <strong>$30,000 or more to supplement the funds we're already bringing to the table. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This money will help cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Operating expenses in the months of growth this spring</li>
<li>The purchase of additional cold storage so we can keep food in stock and flowing out of the kitchen to meet demand</li>
<li>The purchase of a few pieces of lighter equipment to help streamline our workflows and increase our output from within our small space</li>
<li>The hiring of additional staff to deliver on the Kind Food vision</li>
</ul>
<p>If we surpass our goal, we’ll put that additional money toward operating expenses into summer, expansion of our team and (if the campaign reaches high enough) our very own restaurant space.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Sufficient ongoing funding is always a critical piece of any restaurant's success and it is possible we could have unexpected expenses arise at any time that might jeopardize our financial standing. We have partnered with an accounting firm to help us proactively manage our financials, and being prudent with our revenue will remain a priority for us. We will take every measure we can to ensure our financial stability in order to honor campaign rewards, no matter when they're redeemed. Should something occur that prevents us from being able to follow thru on part or all of our funding campaign promises, we will abide by Indiegogo's guidelines and be as transparent as possible in the process. We recognize you're taking a risk along with us and we promise to handle any unexpected issues transparently and to the best of our ability.</p>
</div></div>","We believe in good food and kindness for all.
Hello! We are Kind Food and we have a dream of perpetuating kindness in our community (and beyond) by way of clean, delicious food and meaningful connections. If you're short on time, the bullets below summarize what we're about and why we're here. (Keep reading below the bullets for even more details.)

We make really yummy food that is good for people and the planet. That means a 100% plant-based menu—fresh ingredients, mostly organic and locally sourced whenever possible.
We’re committed to building an earth friendly operation. Our packaging is compostable and recyclable, we use earth-conscious workflows in the kitchen, and do our best to manage our use of natural resources.
We strive to spread kindness—in our local community and around the world. That starts at the window and flows into supporting community causes, organizing volunteers, and being a voice and example in the industry.
We launched Kind Food in 2018 as a pop-up concept and officially opened in the Iron District in October 2019. We've been working hard to make this dream a reality--pouring our heart and soul into building something bigger than “just another eatery.”
So far, we’ve been able to partner with 13 charities to donate over $2,000 and help raise an additional $7,100 in monetary and item donations. This is truly only the beginning of our work in the community!
Since opening our location, we’ve received a ton of great feedback and experienced strong growth, despite the challenges presented by an outdoor venue in the Midwest winter. With winter margins naturally tighter, this growth plus our anticipated increase in business during the coming warmer days means we have an immediate need for extra working capital. Capital for things like inventory, additional cold storage and talented staff. That's where your support of this crowdfunding campaign comes in!
In addition, your support means we’re better positioned to implement various community fundraisers and initiatives more quickly and with greater impact. We have plans to partner with different local, national and global organizations ongoing throughout this year and your campaign support will help us do this much sooner and more effectively that we can on our own.
We have a range of great perks for you in exchange for your financial contribution! We're not asking you to give us something for nothing. No way. In fact, you can access several exclusive deals only available thru the campaign--even if you don't live in KC.

Your support matters. We've only made it this far because you've shown up for us—at events, online and at the container. We’ve loved every moment of getting to meet you, talk with you, feed you and work together to promote that #plantlife and support our community. It is so exciting to see people rally around the idea of good food mixed with kindness. Now we need your support to help us flourish into the rest of 2020 and beyond.
THANK YOU! Donate if you can, share the campaign with your network, and let's all spread some kindness together. Every bit counts!

 
We are so grateful for the support you've already shown us and we’re excited to work together this year to bring new plant-based options and heaps of kindness to Kansas City.
Sincerely, truly, gratefully,
Chef Phillip & Jonelle
