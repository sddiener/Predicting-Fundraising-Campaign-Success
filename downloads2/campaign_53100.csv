<p>In 2000 I started the company Girlchef (you can learn more about me and that business at my website: <a href=""http://www.clairemenck.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.clairemenck.com</a>) .  The most recent extension of that business is TOGO MKE, food service provider located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. TOGO MKE offers the following services to individuals and corporations:</p>
<p>·         Weekly prepared meals ordered through our website: <a href=""http://www.togomke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.togomke.com</a></p>
<p>·         Catering</p>
<p>·         Grab N Go items for businesses who need healthy food options</p>
<p>TOGO MKE focuses on healthy food preparation using local ingredients and producers whenever possible.  The business also serves as an online outlet for products produced by small Milwaukee artisans (<a href=""http://www.order.girlchef.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.order.girlchef.com</a>). A new menu is posted every Friday.  People order by Wednesday for delivery or pick up of the meals the following Monday. </p>
<p>The idea for this business has evolved from my work in food and social justice.  I believe that food access is an essential component for a healthy community.  Milwaukee is the most segregated city in the United States. That plays out in high crime and poverty rates in the city, limiting opportunities for economic, educational and personal development of large swatches of our urban landscape.  I envision TOGO MKE as part of the response to those issues by helping to create economic opportunities on several levels, including:</p>
<p>1.  Nourishing people with locally grown and prepared foods through our meal service.</p>
<p>2.  Creating economic opportunities by purchasing our ingredients from local urban producers, such as Alice’s Garden (<a href=""http://www.alicesgarden.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.alicesgarden.com</a> ).</p>
<p>3.  Opening economic opportunities for local producers by selling their products online to new customers that would otherwise not have access to those products.</p>
<p>4.  Training individuals who would otherwise not have access to that education for careers in food service and agriculture, increasing their potential earning capacity.</p>
<p><br/>TOGO MKE has had an amazingly positive response from the customers we have, and the corporate clients we have worked with to develop our corporate programs.  The business has seen a doubling of revenue every month since we began the service in January 2019.  I literally could be producing 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  However, I have limited access to the industrial kitchen I rent, and I require several key pieces of equipment.  I have had to turn away several large potential clients because of these limitations, and my growth is stalled.  I am asking for capital for the following three things:</p>
<p>1.  Rent/property renovations</p>
<p>2.  Operational costs [Hiring &amp; training staff, Inventory, General operating needs]</p>
<p>3.  Equipment and other capital investments</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to purchase 10 refrigeration units that will be used as drop off points for our meal service in and around Milwaukee.  Each unit has the potential to generate $2,000 in revenue when full.  We would like to fill each unit twice a week ($4,000 per unit per week).  For us to be able to meet the capacity for that volume we need to rent a commercial space that with unlimited access.  A portion of this capital will be used to secure a lease on our own kitchen, and make necessary upgrades.<br/><br/>It is hard for me to put into words how much your support means, because I'm not sure I know words strong enough to represent that feeling of gratitude.  My work in food and social justice are cut of the same cloth, I see access to healthy food and sustainable communities bound together as part of a strong society.  It is my life goal to create more equity in the food system, both in access to food, and promoting those not traditionally represented there.  For me your support means creating a self-sustaining business and developing my legacy.  For the people I work with it means opening new avenues to health and growth, both financial and personal.  I want to thank you in advance for your support! </p>

<h3>Greetings Friends,</h3>
<h3>Radhey Radhey!</h3>
<p>My name is Sudevi Samanich and I joined the team at Radha's Kitchen a few months ago.  I've known the founder, Radha Dainton for many years and when I came back to Gainesville this time I was so inspired by how far she has taken her lovely operation.  She's been a chef for 15 years, doing catering jobs for weddings, cooking for the lunch program at her kid's school and for summer bus tours and for the last 3 years being a regular feature at the Gainesville Wednesday Market,   Radha's Kitchen Pop-up has also traveled to Canada, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Ocala and Asheville, NC and been a part of Vege Fests and Envision Music Festival.</p>
<p>My mission is to help expand distribution giving more Gainesvillagers the chance to enjoy this wonderful vegan blessed food.  I have been in the food business for the past 12 years and it's exciting to join forces with such a talented chef and beacon of love in the community that is Radha. </p>
<p>This campaign has come about because Sara of Abuela's Latin Cuisine has offered Radha's Kitchen a new cafe that she is building for us next to her current very successful location.   Sara started hosting Radha's Kitchen in her cafe for Taco Tuesdays earlier this year.  Her reason for doing this is because she wants her clientele made up of many Latino families and other locals to know about vegan options.  She has been an important supporter for Radha's Kitchen the last few months and we are very grateful for this opportunity to have not only this location but her mentorship.  She has been a restauranteur for 13 years now and has a wealth of experience and excellent track record in the industry.  </p>
<p>Our target move in date is July 20 and we have some goals to reach between now and then.   While construction is taking place at Abuela's we are rolling out new options for lovers of Radha's Kitchen vegan and vegetarian meals.  In this campaign you will be able to purchase a yearly membership that will entitle you to exclusive discounts, invitation to member only events, Radha's Kitchen swag, as well as access to special offers that will be announced in a private fb/whatsapp group for members only.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This fundraiser is a membership drive and presale campaign</p>
<ul>
<li>We need 5k for move-in down payment and another 10k for licensing, equipment, rent, merchandise, website and associated admin fees.  All other costs have been covered by Abuela's.  </li>
<li>You will now be able to purchase meal kits, personal chef style lunches deliverable starting In June through our popups and prepay for hot lunches deliverable starting as soon as we open.  </li>
<li>As the funds come in they will be disbursed and we will go as far as we can with your support.  </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to giving Radha's Kitchen a home, we are creating a business model that allows us to pay it forward.  </p>

And though we tap into nature’s reserves by cultivating the soil under the Apple trees, we seek a minimal impact by creating lakes in the orchard so insect and bird life can thrive. A balanced fauna is the best way to prevent agricultural vermin and thereby securing the growth of the Apple Orchard - and our continued development of new Apple spirits from the Estate fields. We really hope you will help us realize the enormous distillation potential of these amazing old apple sorts, preserving a piece of Danish history while crafting a spirit worthy of our heritage.We invite you to become a part of our Distillery, by joining our community where you are a part of the many tastings, discussions, dinners at the old Estate and walks under the shade of the Apple trees. Hop in!Warmest,Kristian, Henrik, Flemming, August & Louise What people say about us and our journey so far: ""One of this year's best gins"" Michael Sperling, Gin critic & connoisseur ""Spirits of the highest quality"" , Henrik Pedersen, Babette (Danish Restaurant of the year 2017)""Beautifully made"", Justin Williams, The Interval, San Francisco""Smooth and highly addictive gin of the highest quality"", Liva Haaland, Co-Founder of Østergro Urban Farm & Restaurant""A gin that makes Denmark a better place to live"", Gin-critics Hans Henrik & Henrik Holm Nielsen Aka.

At AyoDeks, we identify and rectify.   </p><p>The hospitality sector is a booming industry. Rapidly evolving and attracting people from all walks of life, the demand for efficient and precise customer service has never been so great. How often have you waited long periods of time for your drinks to be served at your table, but when they arrive it is the wrong order or they are accidentally spilt on your beautiful outfit due to inadequate handling capacity?

It is a simple solution to a problem we have endured for centuries. Conventional trays pose risks to the user and result in breakages, spills, wasted drinks, and embarrassment. Many nights have been ruined by drinks being spilled on a customer.

Many have had accidents and been told not to return.</p><p>With the AyoDeks drinks carrier, those that are put off by the idea of working in hospitality because of spilling drinks need not worry about this again. My drinks carrier will give users peace of mind and ensure that service runs smoothly. It gives waiting staff the opportunity to work safely and without fear of their pay being deducted or losing their job by messing up someone’s day.

Greater care is taken to prevent contamination and the spread of the virus. The AyoDeks drinks carrier reduces the risk of contamination by separating the glasses into individual slots which can be picked out of the tray by each respective customer. Businesses will be looking for solutions to reduce crowds gathering at the bar area. My drinks carrier allows multiple tables to be served in one journey which will cut down on crowds gathering as they wait for drinks. The numbering system will allow the user to navigate between tables and serve multiple tables with ease. Any orders placed on an app can be prepared at the bar and placed into the drinks carrier. The drinks carrier can be filled for multiple tables and picked up by the user to be delivered in one journey.</p><p><strong>Risk 2:</strong> All dining facilities will reopen in the long run. The global pandemic has meant that venues have reopened to varying degrees throughout the past year. For example, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme saw a real influx of customers and venues were able to open during this time. The subsequent lockdowns have meant closures but, in the future, the economy will pick up and all venues will be able to open again.</p><p><strong>Risk 3:</strong> It is hoped that in time Covid-19 will no longer be present. Sales will initially be slow, but the demand will increase once the pandemic has been resolved. With this in mind, there will be a flood of customers going back to their favourite restaurants, bars and other venues. This will help to raise the demand for my drinks carrier with what it provides for the user and venues.</p><p>Countries like Australia and New Zealand have been able to defeat Covid-19 and therefore other leading countries will be also be able to achieve the same outcome.

<p><strong>Forest Hill Tea is launching an Indiegogo campaign in cooperation with Huckleberry Days, to raise 75 000 DKK to reach 3 goals:   </strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our story:</strong></p>
<p>Not only today, but also centuries ago, tea was still the most popular beverage in the world.</p>
<p>About 130 years ago, a group of Scottish plantation owners, abandoned their lands, to sail back home. </p>
<p>Amongst the estates they left behind, was a traditional tea-bush plantation, that in time grew into a wild forest of tea trees; some of them up to 15 meters tall. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615022472/qkki3lknlinrhdrieyex.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Wild Tea tree</i></p>
<p>To many people, this abandoned land seemed utterly useless, with low farming potential, high deforesting costs and less value than other and more maintained areas in Sri Lanka. To any conventional farmer in the tea industry, climbing up to 15 meters to pluck the leaves of the tree, seemed both too difficult and costly.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we saw the hidden potential of the forest in 2018 and began developing a so far unseen project. We soon realized, that what we had actually acquired the first and only tea forest in the world. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615022936/dclqliyeh70sfukbpvxp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Finding and plucking tea in the forest</i></p>
<p>We learned, that brewing a cup of the leaves from a tree, very much differs from the taste of the mass-produced, commercial tea bushes we find in the supermarkets today.  </p>
<p>The taste is stronger and more flavorful. The colors evolve as the minerals travel further from the earth to the leaves. Combined with careful, handcrafted processing methods, this brings us a tea with as many nuances and mysterious facets as you can find in the finest bottle of French wine. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615022540/amfxedoozxc3rxzokhh9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Our teas from the jungle</i></p>
<p>Along with the careful methods of processing, environmental care is also amongst our top priorities. Besides not using any chemicals additives in our processing while also taking great care of the tea forest and the wildlife within it, we also saw the opportunity of simply getting rid of the classic, single use teabag, that both pollutes our planet and the taste. </p>
<p>The tea leaves from a tree are simply so big, that you can roll them up, just like a cigar and put them directly in the hot water in your cup. </p>
<p>This was the beginning of the worlds first natural teabag - the Tea Rod.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From single use tea bags:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615022647/uitvkh9o7o8arynx0nel.png"" src=""""/>A</p>

<p><strong>Why 75 000 DKK ? </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>14 000 DKK  ( = 2 300 USD)</u></p>
<p>With these unique products on hand, we now wish to boost our project by teaching and assisting the local community in our ways of processing the tea, while giving them a fair and sustainable wage, allowing them to have the time to learn.  We produce specialty teas and the wages for the farmers are much higher than for conventional tea. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>16 000 DKK  (= 2 600 USD)</u></p>
<p>We also wish and need to develop our production facilities inside our micro factory, in order to meet the demand of volume on an international market, while still living up to our initial standards. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615022816/yjlttabl21l5popcsy3u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Our current processing facilities</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>42 000 DKK  (= 6 900 USD)</u></p>
<p>Last, but not least, we aim to obtain the necessary, but highly priced, organic certifications to access the western market, proving the high standard and quality of our Wild Teas. Selected organism deliver those certification and the procedure is costly for Sri Lankan farmers but mandatory to export to the Western market. </p>

About 130 years ago, a group of Scottish plantation owners, abandoned their lands, to sail back home. 
Amongst the estates they left behind, was a traditional tea-bush plantation, that in time grew into a wild forest of tea trees; some of them up to 15 meters tall. 

Wild Tea tree
To many people, this abandoned land seemed utterly useless, with low farming potential, high deforesting costs and less value than other and more maintained areas in Sri Lanka. To any conventional farmer in the tea industry, climbing up to 15 meters to pluck the leaves of the tree, seemed both too difficult and costly.  
Nevertheless, we saw the hidden potential of the forest in 2018 and began developing a so far unseen project. We soon realized, that what we had actually acquired the first and only tea forest in the world. 

Finding and plucking tea in the forest
We learned, that brewing a cup of the leaves from a tree, very much differs from the taste of the mass-produced, commercial tea bushes we find in the supermarkets today.  
The taste is stronger and more flavorful. The colors evolve as the minerals travel further from the earth to the leaves. Combined with careful, handcrafted processing methods, this brings us a tea with as many nuances and mysterious facets as you can find in the finest bottle of French wine. 

Our teas from the jungle
Along with the careful methods of processing, environmental care is also amongst our top priorities. Besides not using any chemicals additives in our processing while also taking great care of the tea forest and the wildlife within it, we also saw the opportunity of simply getting rid of the classic, single use teabag, that both pollutes our planet and the taste. 
The tea leaves from a tree are simply so big, that you can roll them up, just like a cigar and put them directly in the hot water in your cup. 
This was the beginning of the worlds first natural teabag - the Tea Rod.

Why 75 000 DKK ? 
 
14 000 DKK  ( = 2 300 USD)
With these unique products on hand, we now wish to boost our project by teaching and assisting the local community in our ways of processing the tea, while giving them a fair and sustainable wage, allowing them to have the time to learn.  We produce specialty teas and the wages for the farmers are much higher than for conventional tea. 
 
16 000 DKK  (= 2 600 USD)
We also wish and need to develop our production facilities inside our micro factory, in order to meet the demand of volume on an international market, while still living up to our initial standards. 

Our current processing facilities
 
42 000 DKK  (= 6 900 USD)
Last, but not least, we aim to obtain the necessary, but highly priced, organic certifications to access the western market, proving the high standard and quality of our Wild Teas. Selected organism deliver those certification and the procedure is costly for Sri Lankan farmers but mandatory to export to the Western market.

<h2 style=""margin-left:80px;"">We Have a Dream</h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left:200px;""><i>To Bake the World a Batter Place!</i></h3>
<p>We've reached a point in our business where it's time to take a leap. In order to move forward we need our own space to meet the growing needs of our clients. A place we can bake, cater and deliver for the needs of our customers. Our big dream doesn't stop there, as we want to share our kitchen with other food entrepreneurs! We know how difficult it can be and love to #supportlocal!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>The Midnight Baker was born at the tail end of 2016. What started out as a funny hashtag, during Christmas baking, became the beginning of our entrepreneurial adventure. Nearly three years later, we've grown from amateur home baking to a truly professional pastry arts business. Within the last year our business has blossomed and continues to grow and that is what brings us here today. We've outgrown our home kitchen and now require our own professional commercial kitchen. With your help, we hope to build and equip a space of our own and share it with the community. Our dream is to bake &amp; deliver directly to you, to offer kitchen time for other food entrepreneurs as well as offer baking workshops. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every backer, big or small, helps us get closer to our goal! Building a commercial kitchen is more complicated than you'd think, but with your help we are sure to navigate all that is needed. Typical commercial kitchens are really expensive for small businesses which is why we want to share our space with other food entrepreneurs. We're really becoming a hit within the Barrhaven community by being a solid presence at The Log Farm this past season and returning to local craft markets. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Feel the fear and do it anyway! No risk. No reward. </p>
<p>These may be cliches, but they're all true. We admit the fear of branching out on our own full time has been a huge obstacle for us over the years. Here's the thing: we want this dream and we refuse to let fear immobilize us. Having said all of that, we want to reassure you that if for some reason we do not meet our goal we will still invest all we can and make it work some other way. It may end up looking different than what we're asking for here, but NOTHING is going to stop us from moving forward with this dream! </p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>What's the money for?</h3></div>
<div><p>You may be wondering about the specifics and why we need the amount we're seeking. To achieve our goals we need to rent a commercial space and build the kitchen. The kitchen will need a triple sink with a grease trap, a hand washing sink, an electric convection oven, fridge, freezer, city fees, and of course, construction costs. What started as a pipe dream has quickly turned into a very realistic need to grown our business so we can bring our products to our community. We know we can make this work and we're not afraid to ask for help! </p></div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Chef Blackanese Brand has a unique name and story. The name was given to me by the founder of Dragon Inn, Tony Chang. He taught me the fundamentals of Mandarin/Cantonese Cooking. He also taught me how cultures from all over the world can come and work together while sharing the goodness of a delicious meal. My background includes an MBA in Management and over 30 years in sales and restaurant management.  Chef Blackanese Brand is an extension of the Dragon Inn Restaurant, our plan is to introduce America to the great taste that thousands of Dragon Inn customers have enjoyed for over 50 years. My experience as a U.S. Olympian has taught me that no one makes the team without the help from others. Your contribution will allow Chef Blackanese Brand to create a company that will increase employment in Chicago's Southside. Chef Blackanese Brand is made in America by Americans. Below is a short list of where funds will be allocated.</p>
<p>Fund Allocation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating cost-(hiring fulfillment center workers) </li>
<li> Marketing Cost</li>
<li>Production (rice, sauces, shipping materials)</li>
<li>Rent</li>
<li>3 Delivery Trucks</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Administrative services</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are raising $ 75,000 to successfully launch and market Chef Blackanese Brand Food Company. We plan to create and maintain a healthy direct to consumer distribution plan for the next 24 months. We will establish a foothold in the Asian and African American markets before expanding into major distribution channels such as Kroger, Super-Valu  and Target etc. We feel that Chef Blackanese Brand, led by our three rice sauces will create new opportunities in fusing style cuisines.   As a contributor you will know that you have helped make  a lifetime entrepreneurial dream come true and positively affect many lives in economically deprived areas of Chicago. You will also have an active part of formulation for current and future Chef Blackanese Food Brand products by participation of an online taste evaluation/recommendation committee.  For the first $100 contributors you will get a one of a kind, Chef Blackanese Bobble Head Doll. In the event we do not reach our goal we will use the funds to reach our financial goals through less costly online/amazon distribution channels.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a 1988 &amp; 1992 U.S. Olympian, I have had my share of success. However, after a decade of running a successful restaurant, I have since learned the value of making a difference in another person's life. I have learned that we can make a big impact through employment and affording others to experience economic empowerment. Our restaurant employed up to 30 full and part-time employees. However, these individuals lived in a place where jobs are plentiful. When you make a contribution and help Chef Blackanese Brand rise to a national brand, you will help us employ people in an area where jobs are much needed. In addition, you will be supporting positive role modeling in a community that desperately needs it. For example,  as Head Chef at the Dragon Inn, customers would request me to their table, at least 3 times a week to thank me for a great meal and more importantly to see a Black Chef and owner of a Chinese Restaurant. Lastly, you would be helping the next generation dream bigger, with dreams of business ownership.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are inherent risks in any business venture. Initially, I was afraid of the name, ""Chef Blackanese"" and how it would be accepted by the general public.  Admittedly, I was a bit taken when my friend Tony Chang and customers referred to me as such. My acceptance came when I shared my thoughts with my wife, Tina and she explain to me that Tony/Mary Chang loves us and has accepted us into his family. She further explained it was his way of saying we are one big family.  At that point, I understood we were all living a Blackanese life, that is, one of cultural acceptance. It is important to note my wife is Native American/German and she has acclimated to a very southern African-American culture. </p>
<p>The Challenges are creatively telling that story and letting everyone know we promote diversity and acceptance of all cultures. Hence, our motto: Fusing Cultures and Food Together...One Bite at a Time. However, after the first bite of our sauces the name is just an after thought.</p>

<p>Hey! My name is Greg Lister, I'm 24 years old and was born in Glasgow. My wife, Lucie (from Fraserburgh) and I live in Aberdeen with our cat, Daisie and our Puppy, Bali. </p>
<p>I want to start an Artisan Coffee Shop in the Heart of Fraserburgh's town centre. One of my favourite things to do is to visit Independent Coffee Shops. I've visited shops in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and in the Highlands! Excellent coffee, diversity, an inviting atmosphere, time shared with loved ones and goals and dreams discovered - All of the things a great coffee shop can bring!</p>
<p>Coffee shops do amazing things to the communities that they are within and it is my goal to bring something to the community of Fraserburgh. Bringing something new, something unique, something different. I'd like to bring a taste of the big cities to the town of Fraserburgh. A warm, friendly, relaxed atmosphere with the best coffee beans that Scotland has to offer. A perfect place to hang out with friends, a place to go to work, a place to relax and recharge. A place for everyone.</p>
<p>The other reason I want to start this project is to raise awareness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS). We will be giving a percentage of our profits to EDS UK, a charity raising awareness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. This is important to me because my sister, Abi suffers from EDS and she continues to inspire me every single day, despite her daily struggle. Here's her story below: </p>
<p><i>Abi's Story:<br/>For the entirety of my life I’ve lived in a body that has slowly deteriorated over the years, leaving me crippled in pain, to the point where I can barely get out of bed. After years of struggling to get a diagnosis, I was finally diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome in 2017.<br/>EDS is a genetic, incurable, extremely painful &amp; debilitating connective tissue disorder (which basically means it affects your entire body). There are different types of EDS, and everyone is affected differently.<br/><br/>For me it affects my entire body. I have extremely painful joints that sublux/dislocate on a regular basis; My vision is affected; My skin is very fragile so that it doesn’t heal well and bruises/bleeds very easily -  my large surgical abdominal scars (that are more prominent than regular scars due to EDS) often crack open slightly and bleed; aong other things also.<br/>However, what is affected the most is my gastrointestinal system. I had to have my colon completely removed, and now have a permanent ileostomy. My bladder has also slowly deteriorated over the course of my life, leaving me with a long term suprapubic catheter &amp; looking into a urostomy for that. As well as that, my stomach is also deteriorating. It has always emptied very slowly which has now left me unable to eat without either making my severe abdominal pain so much worse, or i just end up vomiting what I ate back up.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with this condition is it is really not very well known in the UK outside of London, which makes it very difficult for sufferers of EDS to get the proper care and medical assistance that is very much required. There is no cure at the moment, but there are ways to help manage it &amp; to try make life with EDS less unbearable.<br/><br/>As ‘Ehlers Danlos Support UK’ says, “Nobody should be left to fight on their own. Every person with EDS should have access to the appropriate medical services &amp; care”.<br/>Supporting ‘Ehlers Danlos Support UK’ will help fund research that could potentially change our lives for the better, and  will help all of us in areas where EDS isn’t really recognised to finally get the help and care we so desperately need.<br/><br/>If you would life to join me on my journey with EDS, you can follow me on Instagram — @strawberry.theostomy</i></p>

<p>My goal is to raise £2,500.  To reach this goal would be absolutely incredible! It would help massively to get the ball rolling for this project and it would be fantastic to have support from locals. A chance to be at the very beginning of what I believe will be a brilliant asset to Fraserburgh.</p>
<p>Here is everything that I need to get started and what your generous contributions would go towards: </p>
<p>Coffee Machine</p>
<p>Grinder</p>
<p>Filter Machine</p>
<p>Crockery </p>
<p>Takeaway Cups</p>
<p>Interior</p>
<p>Signage</p>
<p>Fortunately we already have an amazing premise to use and move straight into, which is situated within Unapologetic Studios at 24 Broad Street, Fraserburgh, AB43 9AH.</p>
<p>Pastel coloured walls, plants galore, hints of copper and wood, the aroma of fresh coffee and inspirations from holidays to Bali and our favourite coffee shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow - This Boho vibe Artisan Coffee Shop has everything to offer a great place to be. All that is missing is you! </p>

</div></div>","Hey! My name is Greg Lister, I'm 24 years old and was born in Glasgow. My wife, Lucie (from Fraserburgh) and I live in Aberdeen with our cat, Daisie and our Puppy, Bali. 
I want to start an Artisan Coffee Shop in the Heart of Fraserburgh's town centre. One of my favourite things to do is to visit Independent Coffee Shops. I've visited shops in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and in the Highlands! Excellent coffee, diversity, an inviting atmosphere, time shared with loved ones and goals and dreams discovered - All of the things a great coffee shop can bring!
Coffee shops do amazing things to the communities that they are within and it is my goal to bring something to the community of Fraserburgh. Bringing something new, something unique, something different. I'd like to bring a taste of the big cities to the town of Fraserburgh. A warm, friendly, relaxed atmosphere with the best coffee beans that Scotland has to offer. A perfect place to hang out with friends, a place to go to work, a place to relax and recharge. A place for everyone.
The other reason I want to start this project is to raise awareness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS). We will be giving a percentage of our profits to EDS UK, a charity raising awareness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. This is important to me because my sister, Abi suffers from EDS and she continues to inspire me every single day, despite her daily struggle. Here's her story below: 
Abi's Story:For the entirety of my life I’ve lived in a body that has slowly deteriorated over the years, leaving me crippled in pain, to the point where I can barely get out of bed. After years of struggling to get a diagnosis, I was finally diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome in 2017.EDS is a genetic, incurable, extremely painful & debilitating connective tissue disorder (which basically means it affects your entire body). There are different types of EDS, and everyone is affected differently.For me it affects my entire body. I have extremely painful joints that sublux/dislocate on a regular basis; My vision is affected; My skin is very fragile so that it doesn’t heal well and bruises/bleeds very easily -  my large surgical abdominal scars (that are more prominent than regular scars due to EDS) often crack open slightly and bleed; aong other things also.However, what is affected the most is my gastrointestinal system. I had to have my colon completely removed, and now have a permanent ileostomy. My bladder has also slowly deteriorated over the course of my life, leaving me with a long term suprapubic catheter & looking into a urostomy for that. As well as that, my stomach is also deteriorating. It has always emptied very slowly which has now left me unable to eat without either making my severe abdominal pain so much worse, or i just end up vomiting what I ate back up.The biggest issue with this condition is it is really not very well known in the UK outside of London, which makes it very difficult for sufferers of EDS to get the proper care and medical assistance that is very much required. There is no cure at the moment, but there are ways to help manage it & to try make life with EDS less unbearable.As ‘Ehlers Danlos Support UK’ says, “Nobody should be left to fight on their own. Every person with EDS should have access to the appropriate medical services & care”.Supporting ‘Ehlers Danlos Support UK’ will help fund research that could potentially change our lives for the better, and  will help all of us in areas where EDS isn’t really recognised to finally get the help and care we so desperately need.If you would life to join me on my journey with EDS, you can follow me on Instagram — @strawberry.theostomy
 

My goal is to raise £2,500.  To reach this goal would be absolutely incredible! It would help massively to get the ball rolling for this project and it would be fantastic to have support from locals. A chance to be at the very beginning of what I believe will be a brilliant asset to Fraserburgh.
Here is everything that I need to get started and what your generous contributions would go towards: 
Coffee Machine
Grinder
Filter Machine
Crockery 
Takeaway Cups
Interior
Signage
Fortunately we already have an amazing premise to use and move straight into, which is situated within Unapologetic Studios at 24 Broad Street, Fraserburgh, AB43 9AH.
Pastel coloured walls, plants galore, hints of copper and wood, the aroma of fresh coffee and inspirations from holidays to Bali and our favourite coffee shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow - This Boho vibe Artisan Coffee Shop has everything to offer a great place to be. All that is missing is you! 
 
Seeing this absolute dream of mine come to fruition would be incredible! If you feel like you would like to be part of the story and contribute something - no matter how big or small - it would be greatly appreciated from the bottom of my heart, and then some!
I know that it may not be possible for everyone to contribute financially towards this project but even a simple share on your Social Media channels or a mention to your friends and family would go a long way in helping the dream of this venture come to life. 
I would just like to thank you all in advance and let you know how grateful I am for your contribution and support. I look forward to making this dream a reality with you all!
There's are sharing tool within Indiegogo (this website) so its super easy to get the word out there on Facebook and Instagram.
 
Thanks again,

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489626972/nbbqaua6sigczfhug1b4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Jesse Sahlin. People who know me, know two things: I love craft beer and making ice cream. I'm hoping to launch The Craft Creamery, a perfect blend of my two passions. It all started while growing up in rural Minnesota and Northern California, where I gained a deep understanding and appreciation of where our food comes from, down to the nuances and flavors of freshly harvested fruit, vegetables and herbs. I then translated this into cooking with fresh ingredients. When I left home to attend school at UC Davis, I became much more inspired by California's abundant agriculture and, later on, the booming craft beer community.  My love of food led me to a job at a Davis ice cream parlor, where I began seriously experimenting with fun, new flavors; Maple Ice Cream with Candied Bacon, Goat Cheese with Raw Clover Honey and Figs, Compressed Cantaloupe, and Coffee and Donuts, to name a few.</p>
<p>One day I was in the ice cream lab, drinking a beer, and thought, ""why not?"" So I dumped a beer into the ice cream base ― it came out terrible. It was a slushy, icy mess, but I could taste the potential. So I kept at it, trying over and over again. Finally, I found a solution ― a new method for creating an amazing beer ice cream. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, the beer shined through without clashing with the sweetness, and the notes and nuances of the flavors were in balance. Eureka!</p>
<h3>Our Product</h3>
<p>After many more experiments with all kinds of beers, I found that the method still worked! My process allows the alcohol to still be retained. Let me repeat, our ice cream DOES CONTAIN ALCOHOL ― you must be of legal age to drink to be able to consume this.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489627117/o72muypzeeir3ylctuqm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My passion to make the finest-quality product comes from my genuine love for Sacramento’s diverse craft breweries, small businesses, and bountiful farming community. I'm proud of what our region has to offer and want to showcase it as best as we can through ice cream and I want to eventually be able to showcase flavors and breweries across the country and around the world!</p>
<p>In the Sacramento region, the craft beer scene is currently exploding with innovation. The number of quality brews and amazing products that local breweries are producing are fueling my creativity. At the end of the day, I'm simply translating a brewer's passion for their beer into a whole new product: ICE CREAM.</p>
<p>In total, our ice creams have FIVE custom bases:</p>
<p><strong>The Original</strong></p>
<ul><li>Eggless, clean, almost a hybrid between a gelato and a premium ice cream. ​</li></ul>
<p><strong>Old School Custard</strong></p>
<ul><li>With egg yolks as a stabilizer, thicker, better for ice creams that are being batched with more watery ingredients.</li></ul>
<p><strong>New School Custard</strong></p>
<ul><li>No egg yolks, natural stabilizers, some cream cheese added, better for ice creams that have higher sugar content added, not the best for those with high fat being added.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sorbet</strong></p>
<ul><li>Eggless, dairy free, natural stabilizers, not vegan, best adheres to fruit or high acid ingredients.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Dairy Free</strong></p>
<ul><li>Soy and almond milk based, natural stabilizers.</li></ul>
<p>All custom bases are crafted from ingredients sourced from local farms, ranches, breweries, and our favorite small purveyors.</p>
<p>I've also developed a process to create ice cream containing hard alcohol, without the use of liquid nitrogen to make or store our product! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The only thing keeping me from really expanding and bringing the ice cream to you is the equipment I need to make it and a place to store it. With your help, I can turn your favorite beer into ice cream. How cool is that? Please help me make my dream a reality! </p>
<p>Commercial equipment is expensive. From freezers to mixers and refrigerators, the total racks up pretty quickly. I’m hoping to raise $150,000 with this campaign to get the gear I need to churn out huge batches of ice cream. Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Ice cream machine</strong> - $32,000</p>
<p><strong>Blast Freezer</strong> - $9,000</p>
<p><strong>Turbomixer</strong> - $8,500</p>
<p><strong>2 Commercial Freezers</strong> - $10,000</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Walk-in unit</strong> - $6,500</p>
<p><strong>Commercial facility build-out</strong> - $200,000 (I'm hoping to garner about half of the build-out costs through this crowdfunding campaign.)</p>
<h3><strong>What you get</strong></h3>
<p>With the successful funding of The Craft Creamery, I believe I can infuse the world of craft beer with a whole new product line. Breweries won't just be able to sell beer ― ice cream can be a part of their lineup, too. My goal is to have a wholesale contract creamery, where we can make and ship ice cream to your favorite brewery or right to your own home!</p>
<p>We've created some extremely fun perks for you to enjoy, as our way of saying, ""THANK YOU"" for supporting us! They range from mild to wild, from special recognition at our future location and limited edition Craft Creamery items (and ice cream) to VIP access to our party and even the opportunity to host your own Ice Cream Party and create your own flavor!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I truly believe that ice cream can make the world a better place. I love seeing the smiles on people's faces when they try The Craft Creamery. I have no doubt that once you try my ice cream, you will be a true believer!</p>
<p>For the past 6 months, I've really gotten to know Sacramento's amazing craft beer community. The brewers are insanely creative and every one that I've brought ice cream to try ― made from their beers ― has been BLOWN AWAY. They're amazed that the ice cream doesn't hide many of the flavors and nuances that are a part of their beer. Craft beer fans can't believe their tastebuds either!</p>

<p>Hello All!!!</p>
<p>               We would like to start this off by formally introducing ourselves. We are Brutal Beerworks. Our team consists of 3 very passionate people. Lets start off with Eric Johnson, he is the founder of Brutal Beerworks. This has been a passion of his since his younger... much younger high school days. He has been brewing his own unique batches for about 10 years. He knew that this was his passion and has been producing some creative and delicious brews.  The second member of the brew crew is Jason Perez. Most of you know him as the former head brewer from Martin House Brewery. He has been brewing for a total of about 8 years and decided that it was time to open something he loved and so he joined forces with Eric These two brew boos are an unstoppable duo. They have an outstanding partnership that will continue to create delicious suds that will always keep you coming back for more. Lastly, there is always that someone that is behind the scenes taking care of the paperwork, phone calls, business plan, and any administrative work..... you know the stuff that no one wants to do but it has to be done..... that would be Sallie McIntyre. She is the never ending support that is needed to keep us pushing and our voice when it comes to negotiating. Now that you know our names, we want you to know our story and the reason behind this campaign. </p>
<p>         We want to be the first brewery in North Richland Hills and to share our love of craft beer with our community! This is where y'all come in. We need your help and by help we mean your donations and your social media shares. We need to raise money (a lot of money) to get a location, to buy equipment, to pay for permits, and so much more. Opening a brewery is not an easy task but when thinking of the amount of people we can connect each day while slinging out our fresh unique ales makes us excited!! We hope you are excited too! We want you all to be apart of our journey. This means making memories with us, this means struggling with us, and this means working your asses off with us. This brewery will be one that when it opens you will be proud because you know that you were apart of the journey.  Each day the team is coming up with new recipes and ways to make things more interesting for the craft beer world. It is important to us to make people happy. We want people to come in and enjoy what they are drinking. We have been featured in 5 different articles describing our journey and drive. We have placed in several different competitions and even won gold in the Labor of Love competition for our Raspberry Belgian Blonde. </p>
<p>           Our love for beer is strong but it is not the only reason we want to get things going. We want a place that people can walk into and immediate feel a sense of ease. Life is tough, shit happens. We want you to be able to come in and relax and forget about the craziness in your everyday life. This is the place to meet a new friend / neighbor or have a moment of quiet time when you are normally surrounded by noise. We want you to come in and embrace your chaos. What does that mean you ask...... It means embrace that life is crazy but live and love it to the fullest! Embrace the people around you... yes even the stranger sitting at the end of the bar! We are not all the same we yet we all have something in common,,, we are human beings and that means we matter! Embrace that, love that , live that! We will make sure that the happiness that we feel is shared with those around us! This means we will be getting involved with our community. We will be serving specialty beers and with the purchase of that specialty beer a percentage with go to either our Birdville ISD and or our local police officers and firefighters. We want to give back and build our community because we know that it is our amazing community that will build us!</p>
<p>  I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT KEEP READING!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>          Each donation given will be rewarded with some pretty awesome perks. We will be auctioning off a member of the team to be your very own housekeeper and personal assistant for one year..... hahahaha JUST KIDDING! But you will be getting some cool limited edition items depending on the amount you throw at us. Be sure to check our our perks so you can see for yourself what we have to offer.  If you want to help us with this journey but times are tough in the financial section right now, we totally get it! If that is the case then please share us on your social media. Word of mouth goes a long way and that is what this is going to take. We need you to be vocal!  If we do not reach our goal don't stress, we will still put that money towards securing a location. We have a spot in mind and have spoken with the city and they are completely on board with our ideas. They know how great this could be for everyone in the community. We can promise that we will work our butts off to make sure that this brewery that our amazing city needs is opened and able to serve our awesome community with ales that are unforgettable. Know that each dime donated will go towards a piece of our dream. It will help build an unforgettable memory that you will be creating as soon as we open the doors.   </p>
<p>      Overall, this is an exciting time. We are happy to be apart of the craft beer community. We are happy to be sharing our dreams and hopefully soon our beers with you! You are our family and we wouldn't have it any other way!!! Join us in celebrating this outstanding journey. Once again we are asking for you to reach deep in those pockets and donate or at least make sure you share us on all of your social media sites. Help us get the word out so we can start sharing our passion with each of you! We would not be anywhere without our friends and family that support and provide constant feedback! Make noise, scream and shout if you have to but let everyone know that Brutal Beerworks is going to be open for business and we are going to provide you with an open door to the craft beer world but we need your help! We can't do this without you!! We appreciate every penny and every share! Each time you mention our name to someone know that it is extremely appreciated!! Remember we are here for you to EMBRACE YOUR CHAOS!!!!!!!!!! Cheers!! </p>

The Incredible Bakery Company makes gluten free and vegan products that are deliciously fresh and innovative and sold in shops and caterers throughout the UK. The Incredible Bakery Company started the business because of brand ambassador and son Leon - now six years. Leon has multiple food allergies and there was little available for Leon to eat when he was born. So, Valeria got baking and James got selling. In three years, the Incredible Bakery Company managed to escape London, move to the countryside and create a wholesale bakery from scratch in the pretty village of Warkton in Northamptonshire.</p><p>Now the Incredible Bakery Company wants to have a truck to sell directly to our consumers.  For that reason the idea is create the first Incredible Bakery catering truck.On most weekdays the Incredible Bakery Truck will be operating from the courtyard of Moorfield Farm (Warkton - NN16 9XJ) where our factory is located.

The conversion will also create sink, internal lighting and will ensure we have power to have everything working. </p><p>Although we do have a pizza oven, there a many other things we need to transform a simple van into an Incredible Food Truck, including fridge, freezer, food warmers, coffee machine (let's not forget the coffee!!!) and many other little and big things. </p><p>Once the Incredible Food Truck is ready it will be operating from the courtyard at the Moorfield Farm in Warkton (NN16 9XJ) where we have our factory unit on weekdays and some weekends.

Once ground, the powder stays fresh not for hours, but minutes. Then the volatile oils and aromatics quickly turn stale and bitter. In all other grinders, this residue of soured coffee grounds stays in the machine, tainting every subsequent batch of ground coffee. No matter how great your coffee beans are, they’ll be mixing in with this unpleasant residue. </p><p>The Niche Zero Grinder's unique technology means that there’s virtually zero retained grind. You get all the taste and quality of the beans you’ve paid for. All of the beans are ground and all of the ground coffee leaves the grinder. And  because you know everything leaves the grinder, it’s much easier to determine the right quantity of beans you’ll need.</p><p>That’s what makes the Niche Zero Grinder different, better and the best thing to happen to coffee for years.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Niche values</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503996295/d4bhji7p6avl0crnmqro.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Niche features</strong></h2><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503569348/ujcmrfpozr5mjmjb3bou.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our optimised grind thread gives you total control over your grind size, making all your coffee brewing a truly bespoke and personal experience.

</div></div>","Niche Zero's Ready For ShippingNiche Zero's Being Built and Assembled Meet the Niche Zero - the simplest way to get freshly ground barista quality coffee every time, perfect for all your coffee types and brewing methods Do you remember the time when you went into that new coffee shop and you tried that coffee and it tasted like nothing you had ever had before? And no matter how hard you tried, you just couldn’t find anything close? You used all the brewing methods, you tried all the other coffee shops and you tried everything you can think of. But still you couldn’t recreate it?Well maybe we’ve just found the way to get that taste every time. Not many people realise it, but truly fresh ground beans are essential for great coffee taste. And you can’t get truly fresh ground coffee without a great grinder like the Niche Zero.The Niche Zero’s clean path design gives you only the freshest grind every time, meaning you can have that fresh ground coffee shop experience in your kitchen or living room whenever you want it. When you put the coffee to your lips you will taste the flavours dancing on the tip of your tongue, that’s when you know you have reached coffee nirvana. The warm, rich aromas will make your mouth water, and you will know it started with the Niche Zero.""A game changer in coffee grinding""Click here to read the amazing independent review on the Niche Zero Grinder  Why the Niche Zero Grinder for better coffee?Once out of a sealed bag, coffee beans stay fresh for a day. Once ground, the powder stays fresh not for hours, but minutes. Then the volatile oils and aromatics quickly turn stale and bitter. In all other grinders, this residue of soured coffee grounds stays in the machine, tainting every subsequent batch of ground coffee. No matter how great your coffee beans are, they’ll be mixing in with this unpleasant residue. The Niche Zero Grinder's unique technology means that there’s virtually zero retained grind. You get all the taste and quality of the beans you’ve paid for. All of the beans are ground and all of the ground coffee leaves the grinder. And  because you know everything leaves the grinder, it’s much easier to determine the right quantity of beans you’ll need.That’s what makes the Niche Zero Grinder different, better and the best thing to happen to coffee for years.  Niche values Niche features Our optimised grind thread gives you total control over your grind size, making all your coffee brewing a truly bespoke and personal experience. The Niche Zero’s grind dial is light to operate and infinitely adjustable, giving you full grind range from espresso to French press.Take control of your coffee.​ 

Burrs are the machine parts that do the grinding. Our large industrial-grade burrs have been carefully selected to have twice the grind area of standard burrs. The Niche Zero Grinder’s burrs deliver outstanding quality whilst leaving your grind unburnt and tasting great.Cool, quiet, calm grinding.
 

Accessibility is key for quick and efficient grinding. Current grinders are bulky, taking up way too much space and often not fitting under average cabinet heights (50cm). But not the Niche Zero Grinder - designed with innovative cord storage in the base and no hopper. Perfect for your environment.
 

The Niche Zero Grinder is is a premium-quality product built from the finest materials and to the highest standards. It’s a product you will be proud to own. The Niche Zero Grinder's classic design is complimented by an all metal body and solid, oak features. Quality never goes out of style.

Designing the grinder.

 
Martin Nicholson likes a challenge. 
He looks at things and imagines how they could be made better. He thinks and designs; he builds and invents. He has many patents to his name, on everything from gearboxes to food processors. He loves really good coffee.
Martin is an accomplished designer with over 30 years of industry and design experience. He has worked with a vast number of global companies, including; Kenwood, Phillips, Braun, Tefal, Bombay Sapphire, Anglepoise, Airbus, Russel Hobbs, AEG, Dualit, Sanyo and Sunbeam.
It occurred to Martin that the basic design of the coffee grinder hadn’t changed since the 1950’s – and most other technologies have changed almost beyond recognition in that time span.
Martin saw an opportunity to design and build a revolutionary coffee grinder incorporating game-changing technology. The goal has always been to bring coffee grinding of the highest professional standards within reach of everyone who loves truly great coffee.
This didn’t just happen overnight.  The ground-breaking Niche Zero Grinder is the result of significant self-funded investment; with 4 years of technical engineering, refinement and development, with over 30 prototypes.
For Martin, being able to have an impact on the quality of coffee people consume represents the fulfilment of a lifelong dream and something that continues to drive him every single day.
By backing and sharing our campaign we will be able to fund the initial tooling and production of the Niche Zero Coffee Grinder.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>Hemp can change our world</i></b>. As Hemp Way Foods’ owner and management team of one, hemp has really changed my own life!  My mission statement, “Not only to feed people, but also to nourish them with health,” is essentially my company’s operational blueprint. My vision is to start a food revolution and my love of hemp is the driving force behind Hemp Way Foods.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">“Necessity often being the mother of invention,” it was my own experience with food intolerance and my quest to identify realistic food options to fuel my body after I survived a severe car accident in 1996.  In my quest to maintain optimal health, I turned to hemp as a source of complete nutrition. Hemp Way Foods has identified its’ niche as an up-and-coming forerunner company in an industry that is currently trending worldwide.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Located in the Evergreen,
Colorado area, Hemp Way Foods was established in 2014 using a recipe I developed in 2013. I have been recognized locally in the Denver metro
and Denver foothills areas for my business acumen, energy, passion, and quick
thinking.</span><br/></p>
<p>The company operates as a
wholesale food supplier of hemp burgers and hemp seed crumbles to restaurants
and markets focused on healthy foods for healthy living. </p>
<p>In addition, many other Hemp
Way Food product options are on the drawing board, including: a Sriracha flavor burger and Sriracha flavor crumbles, a hemp (plant-based) nacho cheese, a hemp “butter” spread, and a hemp truffle (a vegan
version of a sweet treat), featuring hemp, coconut oil, and cacao.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hemp Way Foods is founded
upon a solid foundation using my diverse background with 10+ years of
successful management, marketing and outside sales experience, as well as
strong knowledge of building solid client relationships.</span><br/></p>
<p>Some of my past work
experience includes being an Operations Manager for an Alternative Health Care
Facility, a Marketing Manager and owner of Boyd Insurance Agency (a personal
line insurance agency I sold in August 2010).  I won several awards
during that time, including a Blue Vase Award and Rookie of the Year Award, and
management/marketing of Cannabis dispensaries. </p>
<p>2009-2012: I was a facet of the
evolving medical marijuana industry in Colorado, and was an integral part of
the Denver chapter of the Mile High NORML board (National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws).</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 2010-August 2011:
I was involved in consulting with several medical marijuana dispensaries handling management task; hiring, rules &amp; regulations, budtending, marketing, and
advocacy to name a few.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2012, I was the
Program Coordinator for <a href=""http://www.hempcleans.com/hc_wp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hemp Cleans™</a>.  I
assisted this grassroots nonprofit in its quest for the regulation and
cultivation of industrial hemp, while the groundwork for hemp legislation was
being laid. (The organization was the focus of several articles that discussed
their assistance in educating farmers and others about the myriad uses of hemp.)</p>
<p>Through all these business
associations I have thoroughly learned and put into action all phases
of starting, running, and operating successful businesses. </p>
<p><b>The Market</b>: The Hemp Industries Association (HIA)
estimates that the retail value of North American hemp food, vitamin and body
care products was in the range of $156 to $171 million in 2012. When clothing,
auto parts, building materials and other non-food or body care products are
included, the HIA estimates that the total retail value of U.S. hemp products
is about $500 million. <a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
<p></p>
<p>With health foods on the
rise, consumers are turning to new food trends for the latest way to take in
nutrients. According to GrubHub Inc., an online and mobile food ordering
company, demand for trending health foods such as chia seeds, and quinoa
increased more than 100 percent in the last year. Hemp grew 110 percent with
women in the past year, which bested the demand for chia seeds in the GrubHub
study.<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><b>Targeted Customers</b>: Hemp Way Foods’ targeted market is ""clean
eaters""—people looking for healthy, and delicious, alternative foods.
These customers aren’t vegan or vegetarian but they do focus on healthy foods
in their diets, like farm-raised animals and foods without GMOs (Genetically
Modified Organisms). </p>
<p><b>Business Operation</b>: Hemp Way Foods, structured
as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) within the State of Colorado, has been
operating with limited funding, and without employees, by its owner Carla Boyd,
the company’s greatest asset. </p>
<p>The products (burgers and crumbles) freeze well
and have no taste degradation at 13 months so a large back stock can be
completed to make sure inventory is always available.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Production usually involves
two to three days per week of working 6-8 hours per day and producing
approximately 100-130 hemp burgers an hour.</span></p>

Hemp can change our world. As Hemp Way Foods’ owner and management team of one, hemp has really changed my own life!  My mission statement, “Not only to feed people, but also to nourish them with health,” is essentially my company’s operational blueprint. My vision is to start a food revolution and my love of hemp is the driving force behind Hemp Way Foods.“Necessity often being the mother of invention,” it was my own experience with food intolerance and my quest to identify realistic food options to fuel my body after I survived a severe car accident in 1996.  In my quest to maintain optimal health, I turned to hemp as a source of complete nutrition. Hemp Way Foods has identified its’ niche as an up-and-coming forerunner company in an industry that is currently trending worldwide.Located in the Evergreen,
Colorado area, Hemp Way Foods was established in 2014 using a recipe I developed in 2013. I have been recognized locally in the Denver metro
and Denver foothills areas for my business acumen, energy, passion, and quick
thinking.
The company operates as a
wholesale food supplier of hemp burgers and hemp seed crumbles to restaurants
and markets focused on healthy foods for healthy living. 
In addition, many other Hemp
Way Food product options are on the drawing board, including: a Sriracha flavor burger and Sriracha flavor crumbles, a hemp (plant-based) nacho cheese, a hemp “butter” spread, and a hemp truffle (a vegan
version of a sweet treat), featuring hemp, coconut oil, and cacao.
Hemp Way Foods is founded
upon a solid foundation using my diverse background with 10+ years of
successful management, marketing and outside sales experience, as well as
strong knowledge of building solid client relationships.
Some of my past work
experience includes being an Operations Manager for an Alternative Health Care
Facility, a Marketing Manager and owner of Boyd Insurance Agency (a personal
line insurance agency I sold in August 2010).  I won several awards
during that time, including a Blue Vase Award and Rookie of the Year Award, and
management/marketing of Cannabis dispensaries. 
2009-2012: I was a facet of the
evolving medical marijuana industry in Colorado, and was an integral part of
the Denver chapter of the Mile High NORML board (National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws).

August 2010-August 2011:
I was involved in consulting with several medical marijuana dispensaries handling management task; hiring, rules & regulations, budtending, marketing, and
advocacy to name a few.  

In 2012, I was the
Program Coordinator for Hemp Cleans™.  I
assisted this grassroots nonprofit in its quest for the regulation and
cultivation of industrial hemp, while the groundwork for hemp legislation was
being laid. (The organization was the focus of several articles that discussed
their assistance in educating farmers and others about the myriad uses of hemp.)
Through all these business
associations I have thoroughly learned and put into action all phases
of starting, running, and operating successful businesses. 
The Market: The Hemp Industries Association (HIA)
estimates that the retail value of North American hemp food, vitamin and body
care products was in the range of $156 to $171 million in 2012. When clothing,
auto parts, building materials and other non-food or body care products are
included, the HIA estimates that the total retail value of U.S. hemp products
is about $500 million. [1]  

With health foods on the
rise, consumers are turning to new food trends for the latest way to take in
nutrients. According to GrubHub Inc., an online and mobile food ordering
company, demand for trending health foods such as chia seeds, and quinoa
increased more than 100 percent in the last year. Hemp grew 110 percent with
women in the past year, which bested the demand for chia seeds in the GrubHub
study.[2]
Targeted Customers: Hemp Way Foods’ targeted market is ""clean
eaters""—people looking for healthy, and delicious, alternative foods.
These customers aren’t vegan or vegetarian but they do focus on healthy foods
in their diets, like farm-raised animals and foods without GMOs (Genetically
Modified Organisms). 
Business Operation: Hemp Way Foods, structured
as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) within the State of Colorado, has been
operating with limited funding, and without employees, by its owner Carla Boyd,
the company’s greatest asset. 
The products (burgers and crumbles) freeze well
and have no taste degradation at 13 months so a large back stock can be
completed to make sure inventory is always available.  Production usually involves
two to three days per week of working 6-8 hours per day and producing
approximately 100-130 hemp burgers an hour.
Competition:
The companies noted below are
competitors of Hemp Way Foods, which indicates the market is viable for these
products.
Hilary’s 
http://www.hilaryseatwell.com
Hilary’s Hemp n Greens Burger
is a product competitor. The business in based in Kansas with about 25 outlets
in Colorado that carry its products.
The Good Seed Hemp Co.
http://www.goodseedhemp.com
With products carried
nationally in Whole Foods Markets, and regional Natural Grocers and Kroger
Markets, this company, with major distribution outlets, is Hemp Way Foods’
biggest competitor since it is also in the hemp world.

(Organic) Sunshine Burger
http://www.sunshineburger.com
This company has a good
website, large distribution outlets and an impressive online (Google) presence.

Marketing: On the days I am not in production I spend my time
identifying upcoming food events, researching potential venues that may benefit
Hemp Way Foods, and planning marketing strategies accordingly as noted
herein this Business Plan. I am active with social media
(Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook) where I posts pictures of food. This works well to spread word about my business and its products.  I am involved in marketing my business with many organizations in which I teach hemp cooking demonstrations, and hemp food sampling.  These are all pieces which have brought us much attention and press.    Company Press:February 2016: Hemp Way Foods was featured in a write-up/review in THC Magazine, “Hemp Connoisseur” (“Take a Bite Out of Something Delicious from Hemp Way Foods,” written by Carolyn Hayes; p.40)•June 2015: Hemp Way Foods at VegFest Colorado!

<h3>Hello Everyone</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking the time out of your day to become familiar with me and my product. </p>
<p>I'm a very hard worker and small business owner looking to create an opportunity to better the world. I want to someday be in a position to employ thousands of individuals, which is the purpose of my campaign. Expansion is needed in order to manufacture and ship my beverages to the many people that are interested and enjoy it. My current financial state does not allow me to do that at this time, and has become quite overwhelming. Based on what I do achieve from this campaign, if I don't reach my goal, will still allow some expansion. I will have great appreciation for whatsoever I do receive to help me produce and ship my product.</p>
<p>I am 40 years old today, and ever since a child I've been motivated to be an inventor. Yes, way before innovation was ever thought of! I have many prototypes, and I hope someday I can also introduce those to you. However, I am highly confident about this beverage. It is an intricate and expensive process to naturally infuse water with the flavor of bourbon with the extraction of alcohol content. So the funds will be used to help with the formulation process as well.  </p>
<p>To show my appreciation for your generosity, I will send a 18 pack of El'ajure Bourbon Flavored Water to each individual for <u>every</u> $50 they donate. That includes free shipping. Please allow 14 days for its arrival upon your donation.</p>
<p>For those that can not donate and have taking the time to review my campaign, I want to thank you dearly for your time and ask that you please spread the word and tell your friends to stop by to be informed of this exclusive product.</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>My name is Emily and I've always cared deeply for the environment but it wasn't until I moved to California a few years ago and started seeing plastic litter on the beaches that I realized the magnitude of plastic waste in the world today. I'm looking to launch this campaign and make an item that will change the world for the better. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Product </h3>
<p>The idea is a straw, kept in a small portable pouch, that opens like a telescope and twists into place so it can be used at restaurants, movie theaters, lunch rooms, even at home! I'm looking to use the funding from this campaign to create my first round of prototypes for both the straw and the small pouch that it will come in. I would also use this money for social ad buys and marketing as well as ordering the first batch of units to be sold to consumers. A percentage of each purchase will also be donated to Ocean Conservancy- an organization that works to fight the biggest threats to our oceans today.</p>

<p>If you are able, I would greatly appreciate a donation to my campaign to get this venture off the ground. I would also be thrilled if you could share this page on social media as well as tell your family and friends! Let's help make the world a better place. </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Our mission is to offer the finest quality African food products in the global market by creating and pioneering an African segment to reach customers of various races and nationalities. </p>
<p>Our vision is to dominate the African segment of the specialty food industry.</p>
<p>By raising $20,000, we will be able to begin production for all six flavors of our sauce line and all 4 flavors of Meg's Sumptuous plantain chips. This campaign is meant to cover the cost of ingredients, inventory, graphic design, nutritional facts and freight.</p>
<p>After arriving in the United States, Nana noticed a gap in the market for African food products. He missed his mother's home cooking and craved several Ghanaian snacks and dishes with no means to satisfy his cravings. In August 2011, he was invited to join the Hiram College team to compete against 9 other colleges for the best business idea. Their team fell short of winning the $5000 prize. However it did not deter Nana from pursuing his dream of seeing African food products on the shelves of local grocery stores. He soon met Tim Skaryd of the Cleveland Culinary Launch Kitchen to make small batches who connected him to a manufacturer called Dorina So Good to produce Supreme Sauce marinade in 100 gallon batches for each run. By the summer of 2015, Supreme Sauce marinade was sold in over twenty locations. Today, it is retailed in 40 grocery stores and is projected to be in over 100 locations by the end of 2018. During the summer of 2017, Nana asked his mother to teach him how to make her salsa recipe to expand the sauce line after having an epiphany to scale up the business. Supreme Sauce salsa will be  available in 3 flavors. He also started research on plantain chips after his father encouraged him to do so. He taught himself how to make plantain chips from scratch and developed four unique flavors (classic, sweet and spicy, sweet and fire hot, sweet).</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Nice to meet you all :)</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500658944/lxtilutuhghi0rsy9cnx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hello and a very warm welcome to Seeds For The Soul – the 100% vegan eatery project. Thank you so much for taking the time to check us out. First of all, let us introduce ourselves. We are a Scottish-Lithuanian vegan family: Daddy Thomas, Mummy Roberta and our little son TJ. </p>
<p>Daddy Thomas has run three businesses in the past and currently works as a project manager in construction (managing 150 employees). He is also a Krav Maga (self-defence) instructor. He has lots of previous experience in management and the overall running of businesses.</p>
<p>Mummy Roberta is an artist, blogger and a self-taught chef who has been cooking since childhood. She has two years of experience working in hospitality. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499175526/xwb378w2dlyqwsqaltsl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After Roberta gave birth to baby boy TJ two years ago she got very ill. She was diagnosed with epilepsy and severe anxiety. She had tried many different options to help herself and to improve her poor health, but nothing worked. After one and a half years of searching, we came across the Vegan diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499175582/s1ri23rqg6rcqsd6u3rx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After learning of all the good reasons why we should become Vegan (to save animals, to boost your immune system and your overall health, to decrease our carbon footprint for environment, to give our children and our children’s children a fighting chance of still having a beautiful planet to live on in years to come), there was no way back. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499175788/i3zyhj4qnrce4nwpzjnc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We as a family love good food, eating out and cooking at home too. In first six months of eating a 100% plant-based diet, we have learned so much about Vegan food. It’s delicious, easy to make, cheaper and healthier, with less of an impact on our planet and the environment. This is when we decided to open our own place selling clean, freshly prepared, healthy food. A place where we could educate and maybe open a few more people’s eyes to the death, torture and destruction caused by animal agriculture. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499176948/mks3stoh39elh8ur05t8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to share our knowledge about the Vegan lifestyle with people by opening a 100% Vegan eatery. We want this eatery to become a place not just for eating amazing Vegan food, but also a place to learn more about the vegan lifestyle, Eco-friendly products, recycling, and to become inspired. Hopefully, we will inspire enough people in this world to make a difference for all of our futures.  When we first started to try and find places to eat out vegan style, we quickly realised that there weren't that many 100% vegan eateries out there. In fact right now as I write this, if you want to go out somewhere sit in and eat a Vegan Breakfast or Lunch in a 100% plant based establishment (that does not sell any animal products whatsoever), there are only a few options in Edinburgh. Recently we conducted market research of our own and found that people wanted more variety of vegan food and places to be more baby friendly. Taking this on board we will offer up a varied menu (which will be posted as an update) and definitely have baby changing facilities. Further to the research, we attended our very first market (see picture below) selling some of our food. This went well with lots of nice comments from vegans and non-vegans alike about our food. This along with the fact that Veganism is a growing movement all over the world, with Edinburgh one of the most Vegan-friendly cities in the UK, we feel the timing of this is perfect and this is why we feel there is a definite need for our new business.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499696189/geu7uhbjbomoymzo5f8o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Turning vegan was a wonderful life changing experience for us, we got inspired so much that there was no other way than to share it with the world. We love everything about vegan lifestyle, from food to recycling and helping to save our planet. To wake up in the morning knowing that the choices we make are saving animal lives and helping the environment is so fulfilling and uplifting, that it is really hard to describe in words. So we are here to inspire others, and to show that change is so easy and rewarding.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Thanks For Staying With Us So Far</strong></h3>
<p>Sooo, let's get down to what we are looking for :)</p>
<p>We have found the perfect premises in the heart of Edinburgh's old town area just off of the Royal Mile.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499175290/chxmbmihktb01ufnxxgo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For those who don't know the Royal Mile is the bustling stretch of road running straight from Edinburgh's iconic castle down to the door-step of Her Majesty’s Holyrood Palace which is exactly one mile long hence the name. It has the perfect mix of footfall for us, with tourists, students, businesses and locals alike, and the property itself has a great character as it was once a church in its hay day, which I feel breathes life into our name, Seeds For The Soul. The Church has now been developed into apartments with a restaurant/cafe retail space on the ground floor. As you can see from the above artist’s impression it will be quite an impressive looking unit once completed and it will only be possible with your help.</p>

<h3>Plant A Little Seed In Your Soul</h3>
<p>This is a time of great change on our planet. Maybe you have heard people say veganism is a fashion that is trending right now? Well, here at Seeds for the Soul we believe that it's a great fashion to follow and oh my, we just love to be trendy! :-)</p>
<p>We are on an inspiring mission to show people that vegan food is not just 'grass', oh no, it’s so so so much more! What you can make with tasty veggies, nuts, seeds, and beans is actually amazing and the possibilities are limitless! From different kinds of milk to delicious rolls and sandwiches, and vitamin-packed smoothies, to tasty bakes that are actually good for you. Yes, you heard us, it’s not just tasty but it is also packed with vitamins and minerals. And what about all the salads and the soups? We are also very excited to introduce different superfoods to you, from amazing green-blue algae like spirulina and chlorella to super power seeds like hemp and chia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499176567/fuect6p2fkpdh4bnmfgp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Good clean food is so important when it comes to good health and happiness, and that is why here at Seeds for the Soul we make it our priority to use the best ingredients available, free from preservatives, chemicals, refined sugar and all sorts of other nasties. We want our food to nurture your body and soul, that’s why we make it with love and care. We use only the best ingredients, many of them organically grown on local farms.</p>
<p>We are on a mission together with other clean eateries to try and reduce the pollution of our beloved planet so that the future generations can still enjoy it and see the beauty of our home. All our takeaway boxes, bags, cups, cutlery, and napkins are 100% biodegradable. And all the waste that we produce when working is composted or recycled daily.</p>
<p>At Seeds For the Soul will offer something different. We will have the following running at our new place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mother/Father and baby days</li>
<li>Easy Vegan Cooking classes</li>
<li>Guest speakers</li>
<li>Vegan Meet Ups</li>
<li>A place to hold Vegan events like potlucks, picnics</li>

<h3>Would You Risk It for a Chocolate Biscuit</h3>
<p>The one major risk we have is property related, our architect has concerns over the separating ceiling between our unit and the basement below. This has to achieve 1-hour fire separation and reach 57dB of sound insulation. This could be an additional cost if the landlord does not want to pay for these works. I don't have a quote for this as yet as it may not be a problem as we await word back from the landlords and will update once we receive word back.</p>
<p>I suppose the fact that we have never run an eatery/cafe/restaurant before is a risk, but as with every business I have run there is always an element of risk. To combat this we will ensure we have the right people in the right positions, as having the correct team around you is crucial to any businesses success and cannot be under estimated.</p>
<p>We think the biggest risk will, of course, be us eating all of our delicious food ourselves and not making any money lol :)</p>

Hello and a very warm welcome to Seeds For The Soul – the 100% vegan eatery project. Thank you so much for taking the time to check us out. First of all, let us introduce ourselves. We are a Scottish-Lithuanian vegan family: Daddy Thomas, Mummy Roberta and our little son TJ. 
Daddy Thomas has run three businesses in the past and currently works as a project manager in construction (managing 150 employees). He is also a Krav Maga (self-defence) instructor. He has lots of previous experience in management and the overall running of businesses.
Mummy Roberta is an artist, blogger and a self-taught chef who has been cooking since childhood. She has two years of experience working in hospitality. 

After Roberta gave birth to baby boy TJ two years ago she got very ill. She was diagnosed with epilepsy and severe anxiety. She had tried many different options to help herself and to improve her poor health, but nothing worked. After one and a half years of searching, we came across the Vegan diet and lifestyle.

After learning of all the good reasons why we should become Vegan (to save animals, to boost your immune system and your overall health, to decrease our carbon footprint for environment, to give our children and our children’s children a fighting chance of still having a beautiful planet to live on in years to come), there was no way back. 

We as a family love good food, eating out and cooking at home too. In first six months of eating a 100% plant-based diet, we have learned so much about Vegan food. It’s delicious, easy to make, cheaper and healthier, with less of an impact on our planet and the environment. This is when we decided to open our own place selling clean, freshly prepared, healthy food. A place where we could educate and maybe open a few more people’s eyes to the death, torture and destruction caused by animal agriculture. 

We want to share our knowledge about the Vegan lifestyle with people by opening a 100% Vegan eatery. We want this eatery to become a place not just for eating amazing Vegan food, but also a place to learn more about the vegan lifestyle, Eco-friendly products, recycling, and to become inspired. Hopefully, we will inspire enough people in this world to make a difference for all of our futures.  When we first started to try and find places to eat out vegan style, we quickly realised that there weren't that many 100% vegan eateries out there. In fact right now as I write this, if you want to go out somewhere sit in and eat a Vegan Breakfast or Lunch in a 100% plant based establishment (that does not sell any animal products whatsoever), there are only a few options in Edinburgh. Recently we conducted market research of our own and found that people wanted more variety of vegan food and places to be more baby friendly. Taking this on board we will offer up a varied menu (which will be posted as an update) and definitely have baby changing facilities. Further to the research, we attended our very first market (see picture below) selling some of our food. This went well with lots of nice comments from vegans and non-vegans alike about our food. This along with the fact that Veganism is a growing movement all over the world, with Edinburgh one of the most Vegan-friendly cities in the UK, we feel the timing of this is perfect and this is why we feel there is a definite need for our new business.


Turning vegan was a wonderful life changing experience for us, we got inspired so much that there was no other way than to share it with the world. We love everything about vegan lifestyle, from food to recycling and helping to save our planet. To wake up in the morning knowing that the choices we make are saving animal lives and helping the environment is so fulfilling and uplifting, that it is really hard to describe in words. So we are here to inspire others, and to show that change is so easy and rewarding.

 
Thanks For Staying With Us So Far
Sooo, let's get down to what we are looking for :)
We have found the perfect premises in the heart of Edinburgh's old town area just off of the Royal Mile.

For those who don't know the Royal Mile is the bustling stretch of road running straight from Edinburgh's iconic castle down to the door-step of Her Majesty’s Holyrood Palace which is exactly one mile long hence the name. It has the perfect mix of footfall for us, with tourists, students, businesses and locals alike, and the property itself has a great character as it was once a church in its hay day, which I feel breathes life into our name, Seeds For The Soul. The Church has now been developed into apartments with a restaurant/cafe retail space on the ground floor. As you can see from the above artist’s impression it will be quite an impressive looking unit once completed and it will only be possible with your help.


We need funds for the following bits and bobs that add up to a lot more than we expected originally. As in it's current state there is absolutley nothing in it, not even the main services are conected i.e water, gas, electricity so it's a big job but nothing i can't handle given the right people and funds of course :)

Fit out cost based on three separate quotes from local companies, (£82,524 the property is a shell, has no electrics, plumbing, floors, walls, boiler, toilets etc completely bare)
Equipment for the Kitchen(£10,000)
Tables, Chairs, Dishes, Cutlery (we are looking for secondhand to upcycle ourselves)
Smoke Alarm system(£860)
Security Alarm (£575)
Solicitor fees (£1140)
Architect fees(£1250)
Stock(£8990.33)
Staff wages(£7467.10 month 1)
Shop front fitted with new Double glazing (£16,060.80)
Deposit for premises(£7500)



We will try and do as much as we can ourselves to bring down the costs were possible.

<h3>Sweet Life Gelato &amp; Cupcake Co</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Taken quite literally from the Italian expression ""La Dolce Vida"", Sweet Life embodies everything that is good in life: Family, Friends, Food, and Fun.  Everyone wants to live the Sweet Life! Sweet Life Gelato &amp; Cupcake Co. was incorporated as an LLC in January 2017 with a short list of intentions: </p>
<ul>
<li>We intend to bring delicious from-scratch baked goods and artisan crated small-batch gelato to SWFL through events, farmer's markets, caterings, and eventually a cafe.</li>
<li>We intend to include delicious Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, and Vegan options for people with special diet restrictions.</li>
<li>We intend to give back directly to the local community through charitable contributions, fundraising events, donations, and other means as they become available.</li>
<li>We intend to grow as a company and as a brand while never losing sight of the previous three intentions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweet Life Gelato &amp; Cupcake Co was founded by couple Treva Nadreau and Christina Polite after some long conversations and late nights looking at our dreams.  Treva was classically trained in Gelato by Chef Gabriele Scarponi, and quickly became passionate for his work creating signature flavors and recipes for Gelato Lab and Sweet Ginger's Gelato before both businesses closed due to management issues and lack of owner direction.  Crushed, Treva closed the lid on his dream until he could figure out how to once again make a living doing what he loved (and was damn good at!)</p>
<p>Christina is a self-taught baker who decided to start making cupcakes with a stand mixer she got for Christmas and hasn't looked back.  While she has a flair for traditional styles she shines when it comes to blending old world style with modern flavors. One taste of her Pistachio Rose or Lavender with White Chocolate Buttercream cupcakes brings you a subtle notion that we do things a little differently than most. <br/> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now, we got the ball rolling.  We have crude yet adequate equipment but cannot operate as efficiently as we'd like to be able to.  Treva is making his gelato in a small capacity machine and Christina could use a larger mixer to save her a ton of time.  They could both use packaging, a web presence, ingredients, manufacturing equipment, and more.  We set our goal at 10K because we've identified this to be the financial burden of the next step.  Meeting our goal means that we would have all of the equipment that we will need to both manufacture AND sell our gelato and cupcakes to the public at a rate that puts us into a physical building significantly faster, with the majority of our funds being used on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial counter top gelato batch freezer, used ($2500)</li>
<li>Industrial gelato display case, used, ($2000)</li>
<li>Industrial heat treatment machine to properly blend and treat mix, used ($1500)</li>
<li>Hitch and trailer to transport for events ($750)</li>
<li>Supplies for both production, distribution and storage. (Remaining)</li>
<li>Should we manage to blow the lid off of our goal, additional funding will be used to progress to the next step of opening a physical location: Sweet Life Gelato &amp; Cupcake Cafe</li>
</ul>
<p>Perks. Perks. Perks.</p>
<p>Perks come in all forms, from cupcakes &amp; Gelato to helping us pick flavors, or maybe even naming a flavor after you!  Or, if you throw enough of that beautiful green paper our way, maybe some big things can happen!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why us?</p>
<ul>
<li>This business let's us finally escape the rat race and get paid to do what we love, create amazing desserts and give back to the community.</li>
<li>You get to be a part of something that gives back. The love you give doesn't stop with us.  We put it in every dessert we make and even sprinkle it throughout the community!</li>
<li>We're local!  Christina was born and raised here in Cape Coral and I moved here over 20 years ago from a small sleepy New England town.</li>
<li>We love what we do!  Whether it's slaving away in the kitchen, creating new recipes, catering weddings or corporate events, or meeting all kinds of new people, this lifestyle is our passion and allows us to live every day through our values.</li>
<li>We have both short and long term visions for the company from start-up home-based, to single unit cafe, to multi-unit expansion, we are looking at this business as an opportunity to grow and explore the possibilities as they come our way.</li>
<li>We have business management and operational experience!  Treva has over 20 years of retail and restaurant management experience and has been handling P&amp;L and controlling expenses the whole time!  Christina is an organizational guru who has worked in administrative and office settings, often creating new systems or improving existing ones.  We not only have a dream, but the know how and experience to back it up!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","Sweet Life Gelato & Cupcake Co
 
Taken quite literally from the Italian expression ""La Dolce Vida"", Sweet Life embodies everything that is good in life: Family, Friends, Food, and Fun.  Everyone wants to live the Sweet Life! Sweet Life Gelato & Cupcake Co. was incorporated as an LLC in January 2017 with a short list of intentions: 

We intend to bring delicious from-scratch baked goods and artisan crated small-batch gelato to SWFL through events, farmer's markets, caterings, and eventually a cafe.
We intend to include delicious Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, and Vegan options for people with special diet restrictions.
We intend to give back directly to the local community through charitable contributions, fundraising events, donations, and other means as they become available.
We intend to grow as a company and as a brand while never losing sight of the previous three intentions.

Sweet Life Gelato & Cupcake Co was founded by couple Treva Nadreau and Christina Polite after some long conversations and late nights looking at our dreams.  Treva was classically trained in Gelato by Chef Gabriele Scarponi, and quickly became passionate for his work creating signature flavors and recipes for Gelato Lab and Sweet Ginger's Gelato before both businesses closed due to management issues and lack of owner direction.  Crushed, Treva closed the lid on his dream until he could figure out how to once again make a living doing what he loved (and was damn good at!)
Christina is a self-taught baker who decided to start making cupcakes with a stand mixer she got for Christmas and hasn't looked back.  While she has a flair for traditional styles she shines when it comes to blending old world style with modern flavors. One taste of her Pistachio Rose or Lavender with White Chocolate Buttercream cupcakes brings you a subtle notion that we do things a little differently than most.  


What We Need & What You Get
Now, we got the ball rolling.  We have crude yet adequate equipment but cannot operate as efficiently as we'd like to be able to.  Treva is making his gelato in a small capacity machine and Christina could use a larger mixer to save her a ton of time.  They could both use packaging, a web presence, ingredients, manufacturing equipment, and more.  We set our goal at 10K because we've identified this to be the financial burden of the next step.  Meeting our goal means that we would have all of the equipment that we will need to both manufacture AND sell our gelato and cupcakes to the public at a rate that puts us into a physical building significantly faster, with the majority of our funds being used on the following:

Industrial counter top gelato batch freezer, used ($2500)
Industrial gelato display case, used, ($2000)
Industrial heat treatment machine to properly blend and treat mix, used ($1500)
Hitch and trailer to transport for events ($750)
Supplies for both production, distribution and storage. (Remaining)
Should we manage to blow the lid off of our goal, additional funding will be used to progress to the next step of opening a physical location: Sweet Life Gelato & Cupcake Cafe

Perks. Perks. Perks.
Perks come in all forms, from cupcakes & Gelato to helping us pick flavors, or maybe even naming a flavor after you!  Or, if you throw enough of that beautiful green paper our way, maybe some big things can happen!!

The Impact
Why us?

This business let's us finally escape the rat race and get paid to do what we love, create amazing desserts and give back to the community.
You get to be a part of something that gives back. The love you give doesn't stop with us.  We put it in every dessert we make and even sprinkle it throughout the community!
We're local!  Christina was born and raised here in Cape Coral and I moved here over 20 years ago from a small sleepy New England town.
We love what we do!  Whether it's slaving away in the kitchen, creating new recipes, catering weddings or corporate events, or meeting all kinds of new people, this lifestyle is our passion and allows us to live every day through our values.
We have both short and long term visions for the company from start-up home-based, to single unit cafe, to multi-unit expansion, we are looking at this business as an opportunity to grow and explore the possibilities as they come our way.
We have business management and operational experience!  Treva has over 20 years of retail and restaurant management experience and has been handling P&L and controlling expenses the whole time!  Christina is an organizational guru who has worked in administrative and office settings, often creating new systems or improving existing ones.  We not only have a dream, but the know how and experience to back it up!


Risks & Challenges
There are over 40,000 gelato shops in Italy and less than 2000 in the United States.  Companies that make the machines, ingredients, etc, have been aware of this for years yet 3 out of 4 gelato shops that open in the United States fail to stay open.  Our business model takes the mystery out of gelato by presenting it in  a different way, with design cues and marketing strategies much different than what is currently being used.  I have done my research and I know exactly why these shops fail and what has to be done differently to succeed.  The first step was in diversifying the product by adding baked goods to the offerings. The second step is to educate and inform the public on what gelato is and how it differs from other frozen treats.  The third and most important step is in the marketing and presentation, which I'm not going to discuss openly but am willing to discuss privately at a donor's request and after the proper paperwork has been signed to protect our brand.
Any way you look at it, cupcakes have been thrust into the mainstream in the last few years, and one stroll down the ice cream aisle at your local grocery store will show you how hard the powers that be are trying to thrust gelato into the mainstream in the US.

<br/><strong>SPICE OVEN, BY THE NUMBERS</strong>
</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Smart Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p><br/>The size of the global smart kitchen market is projected to reach 14.47 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, an expected increase of around a billion from the previous year. The market is expected to grow through 2027, reaching up to 43 billion U.S. dollars by then. Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capabilities are the typical ways kitchen appliances become connected.</p>

<p><br/>The revenue in the Smart Appliances segment in the USA is projected to reach $4.202 billion in 2020. This Revenue is expected to show an impressive annual growth rate (CAGR 2020-2024) of 21.0%, resulting in a projected market volume of $9.002 billion by 2024. The household penetration will be 12.5% in 2020 and is expected to hit 21.3% by 2024 which is significant considering the number of households in the country. The average revenue per installed Smart Home currently is expected to amount to $263.70. The Smart Appliances segment is expected to show a revenue growth of 29.8% in 2021 up from 5.5% in 2020. Notably, unlike many other products whose revenue growth dipped into the red in 2020, these products maintained a positive growth - though at a decreased rate. This highlights an existing strong market appetite for smart appliances in the market that the firm can ride on. Product penetration for Smart Small appliances, such as the Spice Oven, will be at 9.2% in 2020 and is projected to increase to 15.6% by 2024- a significant penetration rate in less than five years.</p>

<strong>OUR STORY</strong> </h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our Story began in 2001 upon meeting one another at Johnson and Wales University while studying Culinary Arts. We bonded immediately sharing a common passion for creating unforgettable culinary dishes and hosting events which led to a close personal relationship. We continued to work alongside one another in business and were married in Charleston, South Carolina in 2010. Thereafter, we continued to work in the restaurant industry honing our skill set, while assisting in the development, opening, and operating of several Cincinnati restaurants. After a tedious 15 year run in the industry, we decided to effectively “ retire” from working in the industry full time to focus on our own independent desires. Damion attended Salmon P. Chase Law School at Northern Kentucky University earning a Juris Doctorate degree and passing the Bar Exam in late 2020. I, (Sonya) pursued my dream of becoming a published fictional author and freelance journalist. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Though we were on hiatus we continued to do freelance restaurant consulting, as well as some personal chef and small catering events. In our spare time we continued to keep our culinary creativity afloat by hosting weekly gatherings for friends called “Foodie Fridays” including wine and cheese parties, seafood boils and date night cooking lessons. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The memorable experiences from our gatherings, the extenuating circumstances of pandemic along with numerous requests for recipes ultimately led to the inspiration and development ChefBobbombs. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our inspiration for LICK originate from the personal desire to leave a continuing, lasting legacy with our namesake for our children.

<p>How is value defined?  This was the critical question asked when founding this start-up.  How can we create value during a time when people have endless options? According to terrapass, each year consumers go through over 600 billion paper and plastic cups.  15+ billion of those are disposable coffee cups.  Although these cups are made in part by paper, the plastic liners to ensure leak protection negate any hope of them being recyclable.  If you were to buy a cup of coffee each day, your waste generation would around 23 pounds per year.  Each cup can be responsible for up to 0.24 pounds of CO2.  Needless to say, not a very favorable carbon footprint.  This doesn't account for an estimated 20 million trees cut down per year to make these cups.  Less trees means more carbon.  It is much more difficult to quantify waste contributed by the manufacture and disposal of neoprene koozies, which are not recyclable.  If you've made it this far, we think you get the point.</p>
<p>Reducing your carbon footprint doesn't have to boring!  On a daily basis, we are faced with more: more decisions, more media, more advertisements, more stress, more waste, more unused things collecting dust at home.  More “stuff.""  The Skinii was formed around the belief that we could all benefit from less “stuff”, and less waste on a path to a Skinii Footprint.  With your help, we aim to produce sleek yet highly functional, multi-use drinkware.  Products that provide you with value to reap the benefits of a more minimal lifestyle, freed from the clutter/waste of unused and none recyclable goods via current and future products. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Why the Slimm?</strong></p>
<p>Not only is the Slimm a multi-use drinkware product, but it provides you with the personal benefits associated with a more minimalist lifestyle. With one tumbler that meets all your needs, the small decision of where to put your drink is already made for you, and your mind is freed to focus on the more important things that lie ahead. By reducing the clutter in your work and home environment, you benefit from reduced feelings of stress and anxiety and a clear mind for the day ahead. Take a step in the right direction by replacing your old collection of tumblers with the Slimm.</p>
<p><strong>Skinii Footprint - Global Impact</strong></p>
<p>Here at the Skinii, we believe in reducing our carbon footprint. We strive to make multi-functional products that not only replace single-use plastics products, but also eliminate the need for multiple individual products that serve a singular purpose. We believe in complementing a minimal lifestyle with highly functional products to help free ourselves from the excess of “stuff” that has become the norm. You can join us on our mission to live with intention. Do more with less. Leave behind a Skinii Footprint.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we face now is a lack of visibility, <strong>being overshadowed by larger brands and less functional products.</strong> We’ve successfully managed to get through the design and initial production phase during the global economic strain of the pandemic. However, we are now faced with a saturation of insulators/tumblers that only serve a singular function but are backed by larger brands and expansive marketing networks. Without your help, not only could we lose our capital and time investment, but, more importantly, we could lose the opportunity to <strong>bring superior versatility into the marketplace</strong> and raise the bar of functionality for multi-use, reusable drinkware. The goal of this product category is to do more with less and consume fewer resources, and with your help, we can bring that goal back to the forefront and leave behind a Skinii Footprint.</p>

</div></div>","Origin of the Skinii
How is value defined?  This was the critical question asked when founding this start-up.  How can we create value during a time when people have endless options? According to terrapass, each year consumers go through over 600 billion paper and plastic cups.  15+ billion of those are disposable coffee cups.  Although these cups are made in part by paper, the plastic liners to ensure leak protection negate any hope of them being recyclable.  If you were to buy a cup of coffee each day, your waste generation would around 23 pounds per year.  Each cup can be responsible for up to 0.24 pounds of CO2.  Needless to say, not a very favorable carbon footprint.  This doesn't account for an estimated 20 million trees cut down per year to make these cups.  Less trees means more carbon.  It is much more difficult to quantify waste contributed by the manufacture and disposal of neoprene koozies, which are not recyclable.  If you've made it this far, we think you get the point.
Reducing your carbon footprint doesn't have to boring!  On a daily basis, we are faced with more: more decisions, more media, more advertisements, more stress, more waste, more unused things collecting dust at home.  More “stuff.""  The Skinii was formed around the belief that we could all benefit from less “stuff”, and less waste on a path to a Skinii Footprint.  With your help, we aim to produce sleek yet highly functional, multi-use drinkware.  Products that provide you with value to reap the benefits of a more minimal lifestyle, freed from the clutter/waste of unused and none recyclable goods via current and future products. 

Meet the Slimm

The Slimm is a multi-use, vacuum insulated container. It functions as a slim can insulator for your favorite seltzers and slim canned beverages, as well as a tumbler for hot or cold drinks. The durable, double-walled stainless steel construction will keep your drinks at the desired temperature for hours and is built to endure outdoor adventures, as well as the wear and tear of daily life. The subtle ridges on the walls of the container provide a comfortable grip and a sleek look that fits into your modern lifestyle.

Whether you are going to that family cookout or Sunday tailgate, hiking for a sunset view, or grabbing your morning coffee to go, the Slimm has got you covered! Cup holder friendly and small enough to fit into almost any pack, the Slimm is built to go anywhere and work for all of your favorite drinks. It will keep your slim cans cold on the hottest summer days and your coffee hot long after lunch hour. It’s even one of the only tumblers that can fit under a Keurig! 
The Slimm is designed to be your go-to drinkware, built to handle any drink, any situation, allowing you to do more with less. No more stressing over misplaced mugs. No more drawers full of old, torn koozies. And no more hunting through cabinets cluttered with unused tumblers and travel mugs! Instead, you can empty the clutter from those cabinets and put one product in its place: the Slimm. Just grab the Slimm, fill it with your chosen beverage and screw on the lid that fits your needs! 
What You Get

In exchange for your support, we are offering special discounts on our first product, the Slimm. Additionally, for those who back us at a higher level, we are offering customized engravings so that you can personalize your very own Slimm, or get customized Slimms as gifts for friends and family. 
The most exciting perk of all is offered to those who back us at the highest level - membership to our Special Access Group! This group will receive early access for the soon-to-be-released colors that are already in process and early access to future attachments that expand on the functionality of the Slimm.

The Special Access Group has the chance to get early prototypes of products that are still in development, at NO charge, in exchange for their thoughts and feedback! Consider this as inclusion into our ""beta testing group,"" so we can integrate your feedback and optimize our products prior to production.

If we can't manage to reach our goal, we will still use the collected funds to fulfill the orders for all of our backers - including the customizations and Special Access Group membership. Our primary goal is to bring you on board as a part of the Skinii family and help all of us move towards a more functional, sustainable lifestyle.

<p>Hello, and welcome to the <strong>Blackbarrel Brewery,</strong> housed at <strong>Whitebarrel Winery</strong>! </p>
<p>Eighteen years ago, Rik Obiso was working in the biotech industry in our nation's capital when he had a dream to create a farm that encompassed ""all things fermented."" He scoured the East Coast for the perfect place in which to realize this dream, and when he discovered the beautiful New River Valley in Virginia, he knew his search was over. In 2006, he left Washington, DC and the corporate world to settle in Christiansburg and establish the antecedent of <strong>Whitebarrel Winery</strong>. In 2015, he married Tess and they formed a partnership to turn this small, locally focused business into something with a positive impact on the community, environment, and the Virginia alcoholic beverage industry.</p>
<p>From these modest roots, <strong>Whitebarrel</strong> has grown to become one of the largest wineries in southwest Virginia. The <strong>Whitebarrel</strong> brand can now be found in stores and restaurants across Virginia and the Washington, DC area. In 2017, we expanded our grounds to include more vineyards and gardens in Floyd County, VA, and opened the first of our expanded winery locations in downtown Blacksburg, VA (<i>Blacksburg Wine Bar, </i>301 South Main Street). As our wine operations expanded, we also embarked on a journey to start brewing 100% Virginia beer made from 100% local ingredients, and thus,<strong> Blackbarrel Brewery </strong>was born.</p>
<p>From day one, our team at <strong>Whitebarrel </strong>has been focused on providing quality service, wine, and farm-to-table food in a welcoming, relaxing environment, and we are excited to be able to bring this same dedication to excellence to the world of beer.</p>
<p><strong>Blackbarrel Brewery</strong> will be a natural complement to <strong>Whitebarrel Winery</strong>. We look forward to offering a variety of beers in our tasting room, from clean and crisp lagers to hop-forward pale ales to barrel-aged saisons and stouts. All of our delicious brews will be made from ingredients found right here on our farm, including beers that are loaded with grains grown between the rows of our vineyard, porters and stouts that are aged in barrels from our winery, and experimental brews made from our fresh fruits and herbs. (We already have an excellent recipe for lavender hefeweizen--made with wheat from our vineyard and lavender from our herb garden--that we can't wait to share with you!)</p>
<p>Our beer ingredients will be grown using the same bio-dynamic approach that we take to wine-making, including mostly organic treatments with a focus on sustainable farming practices. At <strong>Blackbarrel</strong>, we will continue to apply the practices that have earned <strong>Whitebarrel </strong>a ""Virginia Green"" certification, including recycling 95% or more of our waste, composting all of our vineyard and food scraps, and recycling water through our bio-retention system. We are dedicated to preserving our environment and minimizing our carbon footprint in our wine-making...and now in our beer-making, too.</p>
<p>After years of careful planning and experimentation, our hop garden is now in its second year (with six varieties of hops for your drinking pleasure), barley and rye are growing in the vineyard rows, and we've broken ground on our production area and are ready to outfit it with all of our brewery equipment. We've laid a strong foundation and are so ready to move forward, but we need your help to get across the finish line.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>Our campaign is solely focused on getting the commercial equipment we need to bring our delicious brews to life. We only need four main components to make this happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The brewing system (approx. $35,000)</li>
<li>The walk-in refrigeration system (approx. $19,000)</li>
<li>The kegs and upgrades to our tasting room (approx. $8,000)</li>
<li>A hop oaster to finish processing the hops (approx. $2,000)</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why support us?</h3>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will help us open a new chapter and bring Rik even closer to realizing his dream of creating more delicious products under that ""all things fermented"" umbrella.</p>
<p>We initially funded the brewery with our own savings and small loans from family and friends, but we have encountered some unexpected costs that have really hampered our ability to grow. We are so grateful to have made it this far, and we are eager to be able to finally offer beer to our guests. We can't wait to share what we have been working on, and we deeply appreciate your continued support in the home stretch. Every little bit helps!</p>
<p><u><i>The impact of your contribution</i></u></p>
<p>Your support will allow us to continue to fulfill the social and environmental responsibilities that our farm, winery, and brewery create. As part of our commitment to our community, we have worked hard to create new jobs and develop future leaders. We offer fair wages and competitive benefits to our employees, and we continuously invest in their growth and development. Beyond our investments in our staff, we relish the opportunity to have a positive impact in our area through fundraisers and donations for local-not-for-profits (in the last seven years, we are proud to have contributed over $125,000 in scholarships and donations!), education and awareness programs, and support of other local and sustainable businesses.</p>
<p><u><i>What you get</i></u></p>
<p>We are not looking for donations. We want to give you an opportunity to be a part of <strong>Blackbarrel Brewery </strong>from the beginning, and we want you to feel well-compensated for your contributions. We hope you enjoy the perks we have put together as our way of saying thanks!</p>
<p>Since <strong>Blackbarrel </strong>is an offshoot of an established business, we are positioned to offer you some very unique perks that we are sure you will love. From t-shirts to tours, from beer discounts to membership in our special Barrel Club and Founder's Club, we have the perfect perk for you, your friends, and your family.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>Even if we don't reach our funding target, we will still be opening in the future, perhaps just not as we planned, and with much smaller batches brewed without the equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How else can you help?</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially to this campaign, but you can still help by spreading the word about <strong>Blackbarrel Brewery</strong> and this campaign to your friends, families, and neighbors.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your willingness to help me out! Its time for me to take Blazin Crackers to the next level!</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know me, my name is Uvonne Gooch. I'm the owner of Blazin Crackers and I'm an experienced cook and food creator. Driven by the desire to put smiles on people's faces, I take pride in providing the best tasting product possible.</p>

<p>I have worked at my craft for 14 years, gaining experience in selling, creating and expanding the product line. If you couldn't tell: I'm PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS!!!</p>
<p>I started my business at home before moving on to do it full time by traveling to different events. While my many engagements have taken me around the world, I'm proud to call Nashville, TN home.</p>
<p>As a one lady band, I have long dreamed of taking this business to the next level.  This funding will allow me to establish a base of manufacturing and distribution that is necessary for true business expansion.  There is no way I will be able to achieve my goals and dreams by relying solely on my own efforts!  Getting this funding for Blazin Crackers will be the difference between me having a successful business hobby and me having a success national and/or international corporation! </p>

<p><br/>Even if we don't reach our entire goal, the funds I raise will allow me to take steps to make my overall product development and production even faster and easier.  I may not be able to have my own inhouse manufacturing and distribution, but I can still rebrand by revamping and relaunching my website, lease the manufacturing and distribution space and be that much closer to my dream of national and international expansion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p>I not only want to prove to myself that I am a capable business woman, but as a single woman, mother and grandmother, I want to inspire others to follow their dreams and push hard to achieve their dreams.</p>
<p>These crackers and popcorn and tea are absolutely delicious! Everyone who loves hot food needs to try them! They will absolutely make your tastebuds sing and make your mouth dance! You'll be SO happy you tried them!  I put my heart and soul into every single bite!</p>
<p>Please assist me in this dream and help me not only inspire tastebuds around the world, but inspire women around the world as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest hurdles I've had so far to making this business successful have been in trying to do it all by myself.  Currently, I'm the everything: I create products, I develop products, I manufacture products, I package products, I distribute products, I do everything for these products!</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I absolutely LOVE these products (and you will too)!  However, in order for me to truly take this business to the next level, I need your assistance.  In exchange for helping me, you get to enjoy our delicious products and I hope to hook you in as my newest Crackerhead!</p>
<p>The donations from this campaign will allow me to alleviate these problems by getting the facilities and assistance I need to truly take this business to the levels I know it can achieve.</p>

As a one lady band, I have long dreamed of taking this business to the next level.  This funding will allow me to establish a base of manufacturing and distribution that is necessary for true business expansion.  There is no way I will be able to achieve my goals and dreams by relying solely on my own efforts!  Getting this funding for Blazin Crackers will be the difference between me having a successful business hobby and me having a success national and/or international corporation! 


What We Need & What You Get
My goal for this campaign is to raise $250,000 in order to expand on a national (and eventually international) scale. This will fund:

a new customer friendly website (producing faster orders, allowing for cheaper prices, and the ability for you to get crackers and popcorn and tea easier than ever!)
a new manufacturing facility (a commercial kitchen along with enough employees to be able to manufacture a LOT of crackers and popcorn!
a new distribution center (for lightning fast in house packaging and fulfillment of our amazing products) 
new branding and promotional items (new packaging and new merchandise) 

Please help me achieve my goal by donating to receive some of my amazing crackers, popcorn or tea starting on March 18th. Every donation will include a free vacation voucher as a way for me to say ""thank you"" for helping me achieve my dream through this company.

Even if we don't reach our entire goal, the funds I raise will allow me to take steps to make my overall product development and production even faster and easier.  I may not be able to have my own inhouse manufacturing and distribution, but I can still rebrand by revamping and relaunching my website, lease the manufacturing and distribution space and be that much closer to my dream of national and international expansion.


The Impact
I not only want to prove to myself that I am a capable business woman, but as a single woman, mother and grandmother, I want to inspire others to follow their dreams and push hard to achieve their dreams.
These crackers and popcorn and tea are absolutely delicious! Everyone who loves hot food needs to try them! They will absolutely make your tastebuds sing and make your mouth dance! You'll be SO happy you tried them!  I put my heart and soul into every single bite!
Please assist me in this dream and help me not only inspire tastebuds around the world, but inspire women around the world as well!


Risks & Challenges
The biggest hurdles I've had so far to making this business successful have been in trying to do it all by myself.  Currently, I'm the everything: I create products, I develop products, I manufacture products, I package products, I distribute products, I do everything for these products!
Don't get me wrong: I absolutely LOVE these products (and you will too)!  However, in order for me to truly take this business to the next level, I need your assistance.  In exchange for helping me, you get to enjoy our delicious products and I hope to hook you in as my newest Crackerhead!
The donations from this campaign will allow me to alleviate these problems by getting the facilities and assistance I need to truly take this business to the levels I know it can achieve.


Other Ways You Can Help
If for any reason you aren't able to assist me with my goals at this time, please do one of the following:

PLEASE HELP ME GET THE WORD OUT!!!  Tell someone to try these amazing crackers, popcorn and tea and help me achieve my dream!

<h2>What is Try Vegan®?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Try Vegan® started in 2014 as an idea to raise awareness for veganism through my passion for both sustainable change and business. I started by creating a business plan for a restaurant but quickly realized finding an investor to give me $250,000 in a niche that had not yet shown signs of life in my area was a tough sell. I was 26 at the time and living with my parents so I decided to take my savings and build my own food truck. I began by asking my neighbor if he knew anyone selling a truck and he told me he had not only one but two identical shuttle buses he was looking to sell. He gave them to me for a great price, and on May 16th 2015, I quit my job and spent the summer trying to figure out how to build a food truck from scratch in my parent's driveway.</p>
<p>On September 19th 2015, I had my first event in Trenton, NJ where Try Vegan did its first $650 in sales. It was not much, but it was a milestone that showed all my hard work had yielded a return, and more importantly, the truck I built actually passed a formal health inspection :).  Since then,  the business has evolved and expanded while remaining true to the original vision of bringing healthy vegan food to the people while also sharing knowledge and education about the impact a simple diet change can bring. The truck can always be found with a ""Did You Know"" banner showcasing the positive impact a vegan lifestyle can have to your overall health, the environment, and our future.</p>
<p>Try Vegan® comes from humble beginnings and has grand ambitions. Over the past 4 years, I have built two food trucks, a mobile app, multiple websites, a clothing line, Try Vegan TV, a podcast, and a meal prep delivery service.</p>
<p><strong>The momentum of the market has has outpaced my finances and I need capital to keep up with the demand from the market. I want to keep Try Vegan</strong>®<strong> independent so that I can keep my costs as low as possible while remaining true to my vision without outside influence.</strong></p>

<h2>Try Vegan® Food Truck</h2>
<p>The food truck has been the backbone of the operation and I have put my heart and soul into building it into what it is today. If you would have asked me 5 years ago what I wanted to do with my life, I would tell you I wanted to go to music festivals with my friends and teach people the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. Through finding my purpose and acting upon it, I have been able to manifest that dream and bring it into a reality by vending at some of the most iconic music festivals in the Northeast including Governor's Ball, Made in America, Moonrise, and Afropunk. Being able to provide food to people like me who used to be unable to find anything other than french fries has been incredibly rewarding. I truly understand how heartfelt and sincere their thank yous are because I was once in their shoes and have now become what I was looking for. </p>
<p><strong>I currently have one truck in operation while the other truck is in need of updated equipment and staffing. With proper capital, I will be able to equip the second truck and have the ability to pay someone to take it out full time to spread awareness and provide healthy vegan food to those who need it. </strong></p>

<h2>*New* Try Vegan® Restaurant in Morris County</h2>
<p>Try Vegan has been presented with an opportunity to purchase a vegan restaurant in Morris County! This would allow us to have our own brick and mortar restaurant in the county with the highest demand. With your support, this could become a reality as soon as this winter! We would love to be able to have a space to call our own to serve you better, park our trucks, and have our own commercial kitchen. </p>
<p><strong>Your support would help us provide vegan food for those in Morris county where our services are in the highest demand</strong></p>

<h2>Try Vegan® Meal Prep Delivery Service</h2>
<p>The Try Vegan® Meal Prep delivery service was and idea that sparked in November 2017 when a friend asked if I could make vegan meals for him and a few friends because they wanted to Try Vegan but did not know how. I saw this could be the beginning of a new endeavor and since the food truck season had ended, I was able to invest the time in getting the business started. I set out to create an all organic meal prep service that did not use oil, gluten, soy, or refined sugars which focused on whole food plant based meals and before I knew it, it was up and running.</p>
<p>Once the food truck season came back around, I found myself in a position where I would have to prepare for and vend at a large scale festival in another state for the weekend, drive home at 3 am on Sunday, take a nap, and be at the grocery store at 7am to start meal prepping at 9am. From there we had to prepare all of  the meals and once finished, I had to deliver them in my 2004 Honda Pilot with 220,000 miles all across the state of New Jersey. Needless to say, it has required an extensive amount of work to keep it running.</p>
<p>In October 2018 I was on track to sign a huge deal with the biggest meal prep service in our area in which they would make all our meals for us and we take a small portion. I felt a huge sigh of relief knowing this amount of work would finally pay off. The universe had a different plan and the deal fell through. I was devastated since I thought I had finally reached the point where all the time spent working had on this project would have finally paid off. Little did I know this ""loss"" is what ignited my competitive edge and made me want to create something bigger and better with a larger reach.  I set my focus on how to build a bigger foundation for Try Vegan Meal Prep and began figuring out how to package and ship meals through a carrier such as UPS. After four months of intense focus and concentration everything was in place and our reach went from being available to only 4 counties in New Jersey  to the entire state and also New York, Pennsylvania,  Delaware, Maryland, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Once we have refined the process enough and have acquired the proper needed to scale, we will be available from Georgia up to Maine and out to Michigan. </p>
<p><b>Currently, there are two major bottlenecks which more capital would help alleviate. The first is our vacuum sealing process and the second is our shared kitchen with limited time and storage availability. We currently use standard Food Saver vacuum sealers and are in need of a larger commercial unit to grow to the scale we desire.  With enough funding, we could also begin looking for or own kitchen which we could certify as vegan and gluten free. Once we have the ability to scale to the capacity required, we would also unlock two day shipping which would allow us to deliver to nearly all of the eastern seaboard from Main to Georgia and out to Michigan. </b></p>

<h2>Try Vegan® Clothing</h2>
<p>Try Vegan® clothing began in January 2017 as the second expression of my goal to build Try Vegan into an all encompassing vegan brand. I spent countless hours researching and learning about screen-printing in order to find the best equipment I could afford used on Craigslist in order to start my clothing company. I taught myself how to use Adobe Illustrator to make designs, the complex process of  screen printing, as well as how to operate and maintain all the equipment needed to make my own shirts.  Since I had put together all the pieces needed to screen print clothing for myself, I realized I could do it for others and started a custom screen printing company called Quality Custom Prints. I have since dropped QCP to focus all my efforts toward growing Try Vegan, since it is what I am the most passionate and driven to do. </p>
<p><strong>Try Vegan® Clothing is still available although I am focused more heavily on the other aspects of the business. With more funding, I will be able to hire a professional designer to take the clothing to the next level (I have designed all of the items in the store myself), as well as someone to focus on marketing, selling, and growing the clothing brand.  </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557890102/yo2k8ndi1frlj7iapl5g.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<h2>Try Vegan® Mobile App</h2>
<p>I hope I haven't lost you by this point, but I have been quite busy laying the groundwork for this project the past 3 and a half years, lol. Creating an app was something I knew I wanted to do given the tremendous ability to scale your reach since there is a phone attached to nearly every hand these days.  I wanted to build an app that was a one stop shop for all your vegan needs - recipes, videos, blogs, clothing, a community, as well as an easy way to order our products and meals. Building an app would allow Try Vegan to spread information and awareness across international boarders. </p>
<p>My quest for an app began in December 2017 when I found an outside party who agreed to create an app for both Android and iOS. After a year of waiting and constant follow up, the iOS app still had not been developed and the Android app was lacking in functionality. At this point, I knew I had to roll up my sleeves and take the project into my own hands. I set out to teach myself how to build an app and a few weeks later, the app I created was released for both Android and iPhone. </p>
<p><strong>Since I am not a professional app developer and I have had no prior experience making an app, the app is missing some functionality I would have liked to have built into it. With proper financing, I would be able to hire a professional app developer to create an updated version of the app that includes these functions</strong></p>

<h2>20% By 2020</h2>
<p>Here is a is a fun one - </p>
<p>I had the idea to start a movement <strong>20% by 2020</strong> in 2017 after researching vegan statistics and looking at trends. I noticed prior to 2015 people who associated with a vegan diet was less than 1% of the population and by 2017 it skyrocketed to 7% of the population.<strong> At that moment, I realized there was a real possibility that number could balloon to 20% by the year 2020 if we all worked together to spread our message of compassion, love, understanding, and knowledge. </strong>I have been working as hard as I can to make Try Vegan a profitable business and have been unable to spearhead this movement the way I would have liked. If you are interested in helping in any way shape or form, up to and including leading the charge of this movement - please reach out!</p>
<p>With proper funding for this project, I would be able to raise more awareness through advertising campaigns spreading information to people who would not otherwise receive it. I would use mainstream avenues such as billboards, television commercials, audio ads, etc explaining the health, environmental, and sustainability benefits of plant based eating similar to anti-smoking/anti-big tobacco ads. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>How can I help, Vince</h2>
<p>Last year, Try Vegan took a hit in the peak food the season in July and August with most of our bigger weekend events being rained out. This translated into thousands of dollars in lost revenue, and I have been trying to catch up ever since. I am at the part in my story where my high interest credit cards have been maxed out, and my life savings is spent. </p>
<p>I created this Indiegogo Campaign to ask for your support in building the bridge from where Try Vegan is to where it can be once it reaches its full potential. Your support would allow me to continue to grow the vision for Try Vegan without any outside influence. </p>
<p>Aside from financial assistance, If you feel you have any skills or expertise you would be able to offer please feel free to reach out! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What makes you think you're the right person for the job?</h3>
<p>Aside from putting all of these pieces in place while managing them and making sure they all have enough resources and attention to grow, I also have an extensive business background. I graduated from Rowan University with a dual major in Business Management and Human Resource Management and have over a decade of working experience in the most efficiently run big box retailers. During my last 5 years of employment, I was a salaried manager and was responsible for stores doing over $65 million in annual revenue. I had over 250 employees working with me in the stores I managed and was responsible for knowing the ins and outs of inventory, hiring and firing, policy, fielding customer complaints and issues, refrigeration units, procedures for things like Black Friday's and snowstorms, as well as a number of things customers may not even be aware of. </p>
<p>Although it seems like I have a lot on my plate, the groundwork for all these endeavors is placed and my team has formed around me. My team has not been able to jump in full time because they are limited by their current employment. With your support, they could take this project full time and we can grow even quicker than anticipated. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How will my support help Try Vegan?</h3>
<p>With your support, we will be able to fulfill and meet all our needs so that we no longer have to worry about where the money will come from so that I can focus on what Try Vegan was created to do - Bring healthy sustainable plant based food to the people. Here are some ways your contribution will help with our company and expand the brand and awareness of veganism.</p>
<p><strong>With proper funding, Try Vegan will be able to -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a commercial vacuum sealer enabling us to open up to the eastern seaboard</li>
<li>Allow us to have more days in the kitchen to work on meals and products</li>
<li>Get our own facility that we can certify as vegan and gluten free</li>
<li>Hire our team full time so we can start taking this show on the road</li>
<li>Hire a full time marketer to help promote and spread the message of the brand</li>
<li>Hire an assistant to focus on emails, updates websites, etc so that I can spend more time building the company</li>
<li>Have someone raise awareness of the 20% by 2020 campaign and take it to the next level</li>
<li>Increase advertising and spread knowledge of the vegan movement</li>
<li>Have more fun giveaways!</li>
<li>Allow us to give back and invest and support in other vegan start up brands </li>
<li>Hire a crew full time to have the trucks out spreading awareness and bring vegan food to more people</li>
<li>Allow me to spend more time and energy focusing on building the brand not worrying where money will come from </li>
</ul>
<p>My whole goal with this project is to be able to secure funding while remaining as cost effective as possible im order to keep me as the individual owner to keep our costs as low as possible to pass the savings on to you. </p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>Bonus Goals</u></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Old Eagle Tavern </h3>
<p>Old Eagle Tavern is a pub in Trenton that has been closed for a number of years. It is owned by the City of Trenton and they are looking for someone to come in and revitalize the space. <strong>The amazing part about this building is that it is where President George Washington and the other founding fathers all hung out! </strong>It is still available in the city and I have been in contact with them about turning it into a  restaurant, cafe, yoga studio, and community center all in one. The first floor will offer a more formal dining experience with a larger menu while the second floor will have more of a cafe style layout where people can meet with friends, unwind, work on their laptops, etc. We will be able to revitalize the space while keeping the historic integrity of the building with our business model.</p>
<p><b>With your support we will be able to create this space to revitalize a beautiful building and a piece of world history while serving healthy organic vegan food to the area. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Try Vegan® City Festivals</h3>
<p>Try Vegan has attended a large number of festivals and we would like to begin planning our own events in different cities. It would be a food truck festival with cooking classes, yoga, culinary workshops, speakers, vendors, and many other unexpected surprises. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Concession at Barclay's Center in Brooklyn </h3>
<p>For the past few months, I have had the idea to bring my mobile operation to indoor concessions at sporting arenas. The Barclay's Center in Brooklyn that hosts the Nets, Islanders, and a number of concerts and events throughout the year. After a number of conversations, they seem just as eager to have us at their facility as we are to be there. The only thing holding us back from being there is a lack of capital. </p>
<p><strong>With your support, we will be one of the first vegan companies be a food vendor at major league sports arenas!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>ULTIMATE GOAL</h2>
<p>If this project really and I mean <strong>REALLY </strong>takes off,  it will enable me to purchase my own plot of land and create Try Vegan HQ.  I would purchase a farm and build a commercial facility that we can certify vegan and gluten-free where we could produce all of our meals and products as well as a place to store the food trucks. I also plan on farming the land in order to ensure we are providing the highest quality produce while saving carbon emissions for transportation. Being vertically integrated would allow us to ensure quality every step of the way while maintaining the lowest cost possible. We would also create an animal sanctuary on the land to provide animals the life humans deserve to give them. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>Referral Program</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We have also set up a Referral Program as a thank you for your support in sharing our project with others who you think would also like to help support us :)  </p>

He gave them to me for a great price, and on May 16th 2015, I quit my job and spent the summer trying to figure out how to build a food truck from scratch in my parent's driveway.
On September 19th 2015, I had my first event in Trenton, NJ where Try Vegan did its first $650 in sales. It was not much, but it was a milestone that showed all my hard work had yielded a return, and more importantly, the truck I built actually passed a formal health inspection :).  Since then,  the business has evolved and expanded while remaining true to the original vision of bringing healthy vegan food to the people while also sharing knowledge and education about the impact a simple diet change can bring. The truck can always be found with a ""Did You Know"" banner showcasing the positive impact a vegan lifestyle can have to your overall health, the environment, and our future.
Try Vegan® comes from humble beginnings and has grand ambitions. Over the past 4 years, I have built two food trucks, a mobile app, multiple websites, a clothing line, Try Vegan TV, a podcast, and a meal prep delivery service.
The momentum of the market has has outpaced my finances and I need capital to keep up with the demand from the market. I want to keep Try Vegan® independent so that I can keep my costs as low as possible while remaining true to my vision without outside influence.

Try Vegan® Food Truck
The food truck has been the backbone of the operation and I have put my heart and soul into building it into what it is today. If you would have asked me 5 years ago what I wanted to do with my life, I would tell you I wanted to go to music festivals with my friends and teach people the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. Through finding my purpose and acting upon it, I have been able to manifest that dream and bring it into a reality by vending at some of the most iconic music festivals in the Northeast including Governor's Ball, Made in America, Moonrise, and Afropunk. Being able to provide food to people like me who used to be unable to find anything other than french fries has been incredibly rewarding. I truly understand how heartfelt and sincere their thank yous are because I was once in their shoes and have now become what I was looking for. 
I currently have one truck in operation while the other truck is in need of updated equipment and staffing. With proper capital, I will be able to equip the second truck and have the ability to pay someone to take it out full time to spread awareness and provide healthy vegan food to those who need it.

*New* Try Vegan® Restaurant in Morris County
Try Vegan has been presented with an opportunity to purchase a vegan restaurant in Morris County! This would allow us to have our own brick and mortar restaurant in the county with the highest demand. With your support, this could become a reality as soon as this winter! We would love to be able to have a space to call our own to serve you better, park our trucks, and have our own commercial kitchen. 
Your support would help us provide vegan food for those in Morris county where our services are in the highest demand
 
Try Vegan® Meal Prep Delivery Service
The Try Vegan® Meal Prep delivery service was and idea that sparked in November 2017 when a friend asked if I could make vegan meals for him and a few friends because they wanted to Try Vegan but did not know how. I saw this could be the beginning of a new endeavor and since the food truck season had ended, I was able to invest the time in getting the business started. I set out to create an all organic meal prep service that did not use oil, gluten, soy, or refined sugars which focused on whole food plant based meals and before I knew it, it was up and running.
Once the food truck season came back around, I found myself in a position where I would have to prepare for and vend at a large scale festival in another state for the weekend, drive home at 3 am on Sunday, take a nap, and be at the grocery store at 7am to start meal prepping at 9am. From there we had to prepare all of  the meals and once finished, I had to deliver them in my 2004 Honda Pilot with 220,000 miles all across the state of New Jersey. Needless to say, it has required an extensive amount of work to keep it running.
In October 2018 I was on track to sign a huge deal with the biggest meal prep service in our area in which they would make all our meals for us and we take a small portion. I felt a huge sigh of relief knowing this amount of work would finally pay off. The universe had a different plan and the deal fell through. I was devastated since I thought I had finally reached the point where all the time spent working had on this project would have finally paid off. Little did I know this ""loss"" is what ignited my competitive edge and made me want to create something bigger and better with a larger reach.  I set my focus on how to build a bigger foundation for Try Vegan Meal Prep and began figuring out how to package and ship meals through a carrier such as UPS. After four months of intense focus and concentration everything was in place and our reach went from being available to only 4 counties in New Jersey  to the entire state and also New York, Pennsylvania,  Delaware, Maryland, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Once we have refined the process enough and have acquired the proper needed to scale, we will be available from Georgia up to Maine and out to Michigan. 
Currently, there are two major bottlenecks which more capital would help alleviate. The first is our vacuum sealing process and the second is our shared kitchen with limited time and storage availability. We currently use standard Food Saver vacuum sealers and are in need of a larger commercial unit to grow to the scale we desire.  With enough funding, we could also begin looking for or own kitchen which we could certify as vegan and gluten free. Once we have the ability to scale to the capacity required, we would also unlock two day shipping which would allow us to deliver to nearly all of the eastern seaboard from Main to Georgia and out to Michigan.

Try Vegan® Clothing
Try Vegan® clothing began in January 2017 as the second expression of my goal to build Try Vegan into an all encompassing vegan brand. I spent countless hours researching and learning about screen-printing in order to find the best equipment I could afford used on Craigslist in order to start my clothing company. I taught myself how to use Adobe Illustrator to make designs, the complex process of  screen printing, as well as how to operate and maintain all the equipment needed to make my own shirts.  Since I had put together all the pieces needed to screen print clothing for myself, I realized I could do it for others and started a custom screen printing company called Quality Custom Prints. I have since dropped QCP to focus all my efforts toward growing Try Vegan, since it is what I am the most passionate and driven to do. 
Try Vegan® Clothing is still available although I am focused more heavily on the other aspects of the business. With more funding, I will be able to hire a professional designer to take the clothing to the next level (I have designed all of the items in the store myself), as well as someone to focus on marketing, selling, and growing the clothing brand.

Try Vegan® Mobile App
I hope I haven't lost you by this point, but I have been quite busy laying the groundwork for this project the past 3 and a half years, lol. Creating an app was something I knew I wanted to do given the tremendous ability to scale your reach since there is a phone attached to nearly every hand these days.  I wanted to build an app that was a one stop shop for all your vegan needs - recipes, videos, blogs, clothing, a community, as well as an easy way to order our products and meals. Building an app would allow Try Vegan to spread information and awareness across international boarders. 
My quest for an app began in December 2017 when I found an outside party who agreed to create an app for both Android and iOS. After a year of waiting and constant follow up, the iOS app still had not been developed and the Android app was lacking in functionality. At this point, I knew I had to roll up my sleeves and take the project into my own hands. I set out to teach myself how to build an app and a few weeks later, the app I created was released for both Android and iPhone. 
Since I am not a professional app developer and I have had no prior experience making an app, the app is missing some functionality I would have liked to have built into it. With proper financing, I would be able to hire a professional app developer to create an updated version of the app that includes these functions

20% By 2020
Here is a is a fun one - 
I had the idea to start a movement 20% by 2020 in 2017 after researching vegan statistics and looking at trends. I noticed prior to 2015 people who associated with a vegan diet was less than 1% of the population and by 2017 it skyrocketed to 7% of the population. At that moment, I realized there was a real possibility that number could balloon to 20% by the year 2020 if we all worked together to spread our message of compassion, love, understanding, and knowledge. I have been working as hard as I can to make Try Vegan a profitable business and have been unable to spearhead this movement the way I would have liked. If you are interested in helping in any way shape or form, up to and including leading the charge of this movement - please reach out!
With proper funding for this project, I would be able to raise more awareness through advertising campaigns spreading information to people who would not otherwise receive it. I would use mainstream avenues such as billboards, television commercials, audio ads, etc explaining the health, environmental, and sustainability benefits of plant based eating similar to anti-smoking/anti-big tobacco ads. 

 
Try Vegan TV / Content Creation
Through building the business of Try Vegan I have been able to meet some amazing people who share the vision and are using their unique skills to help reach our desired goal of helping people.
Our current content includes

Try Vegan Food Truck adventures
Vince's Indiegogo Journey
Erin's Ethical Eats
Rawfully Tempting
Conscious Yoga
Vegan Mommy Blog
Catching up with Vince Podcast

With your support, we will be able to get professional equipment as opposed to our current set up of cell phone cameras as recording devices.  
As an added bonus, if we reach a goal beyond our wildest expectations, we will create a documentary style reality show based around the Try Vegan lifestyle!
 
How can I help, Vince
Last year, Try Vegan took a hit in the peak food the season in July and August with most of our bigger weekend events being rained out. This translated into thousands of dollars in lost revenue, and I have been trying to catch up ever since. I am at the part in my story where my high interest credit cards have been maxed out, and my life savings is spent. 
I created this Indiegogo Campaign to ask for your support in building the bridge from where Try Vegan is to where it can be once it reaches its full potential. Your support would allow me to continue to grow the vision for Try Vegan without any outside influence. 
Aside from financial assistance, If you feel you have any skills or expertise you would be able to offer please feel free to reach out! 
 
What makes you think you're the right person for the job?
Aside from putting all of these pieces in place while managing them and making sure they all have enough resources and attention to grow, I also have an extensive business background. I graduated from Rowan University with a dual major in Business Management and Human Resource Management and have over a decade of working experience in the most efficiently run big box retailers. During my last 5 years of employment, I was a salaried manager and was responsible for stores doing over $65 million in annual revenue. I had over 250 employees working with me in the stores I managed and was responsible for knowing the ins and outs of inventory, hiring and firing, policy, fielding customer complaints and issues, refrigeration units, procedures for things like Black Friday's and snowstorms, as well as a number of things customers may not even be aware of. 
Although it seems like I have a lot on my plate, the groundwork for all these endeavors is placed and my team has formed around me. My team has not been able to jump in full time because they are limited by their current employment. With your support, they could take this project full time and we can grow even quicker than anticipated. 
 
How will my support help Try Vegan?
With your support, we will be able to fulfill and meet all our needs so that we no longer have to worry about where the money will come from so that I can focus on what Try Vegan was created to do - Bring healthy sustainable plant based food to the people. Here are some ways your contribution will help with our company and expand the brand and awareness of veganism.
With proper funding, Try Vegan will be able to -

Purchase a commercial vacuum sealer enabling us to open up to the eastern seaboard
Allow us to have more days in the kitchen to work on meals and products
Get our own facility that we can certify as vegan and gluten free
Hire our team full time so we can start taking this show on the road
Hire a full time marketer to help promote and spread the message of the brand
Hire an assistant to focus on emails, updates websites, etc so that I can spend more time building the company
Have someone raise awareness of the 20% by 2020 campaign and take it to the next level
Increase advertising and spread knowledge of the vegan movement
Have more fun giveaways!
Allow us to give back and invest and support in other vegan start up brands 
Hire a crew full time to have the trucks out spreading awareness and bring vegan food to more people
Allow me to spend more time and energy focusing on building the brand not worrying where money will come from 

My whole goal with this project is to be able to secure funding while remaining as cost effective as possible im order to keep me as the individual owner to keep our costs as low as possible to pass the savings on to you.

Bonus Goals
 
Old Eagle Tavern 
Old Eagle Tavern is a pub in Trenton that has been closed for a number of years. It is owned by the City of Trenton and they are looking for someone to come in and revitalize the space. The amazing part about this building is that it is where President George Washington and the other founding fathers all hung out! It is still available in the city and I have been in contact with them about turning it into a  restaurant, cafe, yoga studio, and community center all in one. The first floor will offer a more formal dining experience with a larger menu while the second floor will have more of a cafe style layout where people can meet with friends, unwind, work on their laptops, etc. We will be able to revitalize the space while keeping the historic integrity of the building with our business model.
With your support we will be able to create this space to revitalize a beautiful building and a piece of world history while serving healthy organic vegan food to the area. 
 
Try Vegan® City Festivals
Try Vegan has attended a large number of festivals and we would like to begin planning our own events in different cities. It would be a food truck festival with cooking classes, yoga, culinary workshops, speakers, vendors, and many other unexpected surprises. 
 
Concession at Barclay's Center in Brooklyn 
For the past few months, I have had the idea to bring my mobile operation to indoor concessions at sporting arenas. The Barclay's Center in Brooklyn that hosts the Nets, Islanders, and a number of concerts and events throughout the year. After a number of conversations, they seem just as eager to have us at their facility as we are to be there. The only thing holding us back from being there is a lack of capital. 
With your support, we will be one of the first vegan companies be a food vendor at major league sports arenas!
 
ULTIMATE GOAL
If this project really and I mean REALLY takes off,  it will enable me to purchase my own plot of land and create Try Vegan HQ.  I would purchase a farm and build a commercial facility that we can certify vegan and gluten-free where we could produce all of our meals and products as well as a place to store the food trucks. I also plan on farming the land in order to ensure we are providing the highest quality produce while saving carbon emissions for transportation. Being vertically integrated would allow us to ensure quality every step of the way while maintaining the lowest cost possible. We would also create an animal sanctuary on the land to provide animals the life humans deserve to give them.

<h3>What is Fawesome Foods?</h3>
<p>Fawesome Foods is made up of a two-person team—David Dellosa and Scott Kessler, and we’re looking for your help in taking our protein-packed vegan jerky to the next level. </p>
<p>After adopting plant-based diets in an effort to better our planet, our health, and most importantly end our own contributions to animal cruelty, we thought we could do more. Fawesome Foods was born from our desire to help people transition to a more plant-based diet and thus decrease the exploitation of animals.</p>
<p>We started making our own vegan jerky after finding the current options out there lacked in flavor, texture, and quality ingredients. Our culinary goal from the start was to make a product that was non-gmo, free of preservatives, low in sodium, you get the idea. We spent months and months researching ingredients, developing processes, and testing our recipes. After solidifying 4 different flavors/recipes, we narrowed it down to the top two favorite flavors. The response we’ve received has been overwhelmingly positive, from both herbivores and carnivores. People love the chewy texture, authentic flavor, and option to eat it by itself as a snack or as an add-on to their favorite food.</p>

<h3>How the Money Will be Used</h3>
<p>What began as a passion project in 2016 has evolved into a meaningful business that has us both working nights and weekends on-top of full-time jobs. So far, we have funded Fawesome entirely ourselves. From our initial brainstorm almost two years ago to our most recent trip to the kitchen, every dollar and minute spent on this has been our own. Currently, we’re members of a food business incubator in Cleveland, Ohio—utilizing a shared kitchen space—but we have aspirations of securing our own private commercial kitchen space here in Northeast Ohio. We also hope to purchase our own equipment, produce our new packaging, and continue to grow this business and help people and animals live better lives. <strong>Join in, be a botanical builder, and help us change the world for the better.</strong> <strong>:) </strong>Plus, we have some pretty great Fawesome swag to send your way. And if you are unable to contribute at the moment, any help spreading the word is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! I'm Cody Castiglia, the Chef/Owner of Della Terra. I grew up in a family of chefs and foodies in Western New York, then earned degrees in culinary arts and hotel and restaurant management. I then gained hands on experience by working in high-volume catering as well as intimate, fine-dining, James Beard Award-recognized restaurants throughout New York and Texas.</li>
<li>Last year, I moved to the Seattle area to finally be in the same city as my lovely (then-girlfriend) wife, Lia. Della Terra started up soon after, and we now live and work in our dream town, the charming Historic Downtown Snohomish. With Della Terra, I aim to merge the experiences I've had with my own flavors and creations, providing truly farm-to-table dining and warm hospitality to groups of all sizes. I'm SO eager to continue to share all that I have learned from my family, my education and my experiences working under some of the best farm-to-table chefs throughout the country.</li>
<li><p>Meaning “from the earth”, Della Terra ventures include catering, cooking classes, and events, all staying true to the philosophy of using the best ingredients available from the local harvest. This allows us to be creative with the vast bounty we have available in the Northwest, resulting in better tasting and better-for-you food. We source the majority of our ingredients from within the community from local farms and producers, many of which are located just miles from our kitchen in Snohomish.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that through real, local food and warm hospitality, we can make a substantial impact on our local economy, community and the environment at-large. Outlined below are a few ways in which we have achieved this, and how we plan to continue in this pursuit.</p></li>
<li>We have an upcoming incredible opportunity to obtain and renovate a kitchen of our own, in our beloved Historic Downtown Snohomish. But we need your help! If you believe in our mission and vision as a business, would you consider joining with us on this journey, and supporting this next chapter however you are able?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking $35,000 in funds to launch Della Terra's transition into a culinary kitchen of our own. </li>
<li><p>Della Terra has been operating out of the Hungry Pelican restaurant as a commissary kitchen. Unfortunately, the owner of the Hungry Pelican, closed operations last year, due to a family tragedy. To stay in Snohomish and keep operating as a business, we assumed the building's lease. The next step is to purchase the existing equipment and renovate a bit to fit the needs of our business.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use the funds to purchase the existing equipment and (if we reach our entire goal) renovate the space a bit to fit our business needs: more cooking equipment to be able to take on larger events, furthering our mission to support local farms, and providing an inviting and comfortable space for cooking classes &amp; events. </p></li>
<li>We are SO excited to be able to offer an incredible line-up of edible, enjoyable, or experiential perks and gifts for your contribution, all of which, in line with our business, represent our region well.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Where We've Been</h3>
<ul>
<li>Della Terra started with $10 and ten years of dreams, education, experience. The goal was to fill the niche for a truly farm-to-table caterer and to provide authentic, warm hospitality to our community. This has quickly come true, as we have served guests in the areas of professional athletic events, weddings, corporate and family functions, and developed a pop up dinner and cooking class program that has featured local, seasonal ingredients and built a sense of community in our area.</li>
<li>Tremendous amount of thought has gone into the details of our business plan and the sourcing of each ingredient, as to benefit the local community, economy, and environment.</li>
<li>Della Terra is not only “from the earth”, but we strive to be “for the earth” as well. The majority of our ingredients are sourced from within the community, with preference to small, family farms. Our dedication to sourcing locally means that not only are the ingredients as fresh as possible, but they also have less impact on the environment than sourcing from elsewhere. We are dedicated to using Non-GMO and organic ingredients, providing containers and utensils that are recyclable or compostable, and striving for zero waste.</li>
<li>We’re also committed to growing our local community economically. Our motto is “Community Over Competition”. We believe in partnering with other local businesses, in an effort to learn and grow together. This enables both parties to share in knowledge, exposure, and to develop a sense of team. Operating in Snohomish has been an excellent opportunity to work with local businesses, including ranchers, cheesemakers, winemakers, many of which are right down the road.</li>
<li>We have also had the pleasure of impacting our community socially. We believe that small business is best used as a vessel to give back to the local community. We have had the opportunity over the last year to partner with many programs that give back, specifically in the areas of hunger and homelessness, and organizations that support local farming.</li>
<li>Through our cooking class program, we have created a sense of community, empowering our neighbors to cook real food using local and seasonal ingredients. Featuring recipes that are easy to replicate at home, the classes are hands-on, fun, and engaging. The cooking classes are led by a deep and diverse line-up of chef-instructors, who all have incredible education and experience to bring to the table. Our guests take with them not only recipes, but techniques and confidence to create fresh, mouth-watering dishes at home. Our cooking classes have become increasingly popular, and have caught the eye and taste buds of the local media, as we have been featured in 425 Magazine, Everett Daily Herald, Basil &amp; Salt Magazine, Eat Stay Love, and more.</li>
<li>We are inspired by the “Slow Food Movement”, which started in Torino, Italy. Slow Food encourages taking time to prepare meals from scratch and share them with family and friends. It was started as an alternative to fast food and, as such, strives to preserve traditional and regional cuisine, advocating for the farming of plants, seeds, and livestock characteristic of local ecosystems. We believe that dining together comforts people and builds community.</li>
<li>Our cooking classes, catering, and events have caught the eye and taste buds of the local media, as we have recently been featured in 425 Magazine, Everett Daily Herald, Basil &amp; Salt Magazine, Eat Stay Love, and more.</li>

Spread the word! We appreciate all your support, and we thank you for your time. Don't just take our word for itAs women we must look after ourselves and be mindful of the things that we are consuming.  Green tea is on my list of “go to drinks”.  It is packed full of antioxidants and minerals, and studies have proven it’s consumption increases brain function, lowers anxiety levels, and helps to improve your overall mood.  The most important benefit that I see as a health care professional is that is reduces the risk of heart disease, which is the leading cause of death of women in the United States.  ~L. Holloway, DC Zinc is an essential mineral that is often underestimated.  It is a powerful immunity booster that helps to fight off the common cold, aids in the wound healing process and can help combat age related muscular degeneration. ~L. Holloway, DC Yerba Mate has a long tradition of medicinal uses and proven health benefits.  It is an energy boosting powerhouse that is chocked full of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Yerba Mate is a healthy replacement for caffeinated drinks such as coffee and soda.  Here is my favorite part….. Yerba Mate has been scientifically proven to help with weight loss!~L. Holloway, DC “B12 is needed in the human body to produce healthy red blood cells, maintain a normal neurologic function, and DNA synthesis.  So, to break this down in terms of understanding, B12 is needed for energy, concentration, cognitive functions, balance and gait. Taking B12 in the recommended dose and form can prevent Vitamin B12 deficiency and malabsorption. “~Kennosa Gunn MSN-Ed, BSN, RN “Biotin is a B7 vitamin that is needed for metabolism, nerve, and cardiovascular function and most importantly healthy hair, nail and skin protection.  Biotin can aid in younger looking skin by preventing acne, dry and flaky skin.  It also plays a vital role in hair growth by preventing brittle, dry and flaky scalp that can cause breakage and damage.  Biotin strengthens your hair follicles promoting healthy hair growth.  Dry, cracking, thinning and splitting of nails can benefit from biotin supplementation producing healthier and stronger nails. “~Kennosa Gunn MSN-Ed, BSN, RN "" The first step in living our best life is proper nutrition. Being active doesn't always provide time to allow us to take in all the nutrients we need. Beautylixirs provides the perfect blend of vitamins and nutrients to keep you looking and feeling your best on the go.""~Anna Edwards Dotfit Certified Fitness Professional",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Ralph is looking to open a food truck which serves gourmet burgers and sandwiches with a twist.  Possible menu items include fajita burgers, the B.L.D. (breakfast, lunch, dinner), and the club burger. He has several great ideas though, and plans to have many creative food options.</p>
<p>A graduate of Central High School and Pueblo Community College, Ralph holds a double degree in Culinary Arts Production and Management.  His schooling has taught him the ins and outs of the food industry, but his skill comes naturally.  Ralph says, “When I realized how much others enjoyed my cooking and saw the smiles and enjoyment on their faces, I knew cooking was my calling.”  12 years of management at his current employer has taught him the ins and outs of business, to complement his natural culinary talent. </p>
<p>With the combination of Ralph’s business knowledge, cooking skill, and big heart, this business is the real deal.  Ralph is a home-town guy trying to help his family and the community grow in a positive way.  He could easily take his skills to a bigger city, but he wants to give back to the town he calls home. </p>

<p>The whole concept of Willard's comes from what I would say are two things I've always valued.</p>
<p>Ice Cream and people.  </p>
<p>So many of my earliest memories involve standing in line after t-ball, trips to hutches after Ticat games, or just sitting with family and friends with a big bowl of ice cream, and I mean big.</p>
<p>As far back as I can remember I have loved ice cream.  Something about the deliciously cold taste has always captured my heart but right alongside that has been my love for people and community.  I firmly believe there is nothing better than sharing laughs and ice cream with those you love.</p>
<p>So when I got a small ice cream machine for my birthday it was only natural that I wanted to share my experiments with others.  Creating unique and different flavours- always trying to find something new and finding ways to allow all to enjoy it; making both traditional ice cream and vegan dairy-free options to bring smiles to everyone.</p>
<p>As this passion grew I wanted to see where it could lead.  So two years ago I started selling through local businesses and now with my wife, we want to take on the next experiment and open up a shop of our own.<br/><br/>After searching we have found a place to call home - in the city we love, surrounded by the community we love - finding a way to celebrate those two loves once more.</p>
<p>And spread what I have always known.</p>
<p>That sometimes its okay to eat your feelings </p>
<p>Whether it's a celebration of something good, or finding comfort through the rough times, Willard's wants to be with you through both. We want to join you through it all to bring a smile, a laugh or even just a little bit of comfort.</p>
<p>We value community, simplicity and creativity and hope to see all three reflected in every scoop of ice cream and every smile brought to someone's face.  From simple ingredients to simple joys we aim to help people come together over food - deeply believing that good food often breeds good community.</p>
<p>With creative flavours we hope to inspire creativity in others, in whatever form that may take.  To us, this is much more than just a business but something in which we hope to make a difference in this city, even if it is just a smile.</p>
<p>So with that, we're asking for your help.  We've poured our hearts, our energy, and money into this and would love to join with the greater Hamilton community - our family, our friends and our future friends to help make this a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we need your help</h3>
<p>From the very beginning Willard's has been about more than just ice cream.  It's been about being a part of something bigger, about creating community.  Without the support of businesses and people in Hamilton, Willard's would never have existed.  From starting out in the Kitchen Collective making food with other businesses in the city, to the support given by the businesses that carry our product, to the friends who encouraged us, did our branding ,and supported us every step of the way- we didn't do this on our own.  </p>
<p>We're hoping we can rely on that help again.</p>
<p>Renovations are expensive, commercial ones more so.  We've gone all in on this; Buying the building, doing the early labour ourselves, getting grants and loans in addition to our own money. We're committed to this long term.</p>
<p>With all that being said, If you're going to partner with us you deserve to know where the money is going.</p>
<p>Indiegogo fees - 8% of funds raised - $800</p>
<p>Permits, Architect fees, etc - $8000</p>
<p>Renovation costs- $70000</p>
<p>Equipment costs -$20000 - Range, Dipping cabinet, Exhaust Hood, Freezer, Prep Tables</p>
<p>As you can see, the money raised here is just a fraction of what's being put into the space so even if we don't make our goal we're pushing forward - but hope to do it with a bit less burden in terms of what we owe, all while giving you guys great rewards to say thanks for your help.</p>
<p>From delicious ice cream, both dairy and vegan, to sweet products like pins and shirts to creative ice cream experiences we want to make this worth it and say thank you for all of your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Every bit can help</h3>
<p>Having helped run the Kitchen Collective campaign that had almost 200 backers and raised $22000 we've seen first hand what a difference the support of a community can be.  The Kitchen Collective wouldn't exist without this support and now it is thriving and providing great opportunities in the community and we hope to do the same. We want Willard's to be more than an ice cream shop but to be a place for people to laugh, connect and build friendships.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>This has been a journey.  We've already been working on the space for months and have the design done, done demolition, and it's tiring and stressful - but ultimately will be worth it.</p>
<p>We're sure there are hurdles and obstacles along the way but we believe we've got the right people to support us and to make this dream a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>More than money</h3>
<p>This campaign is more than just about money (though it's huge help).  If you're not able to help please share this campaign, tell your friends and family- both about the campaign and the store when it opens. </p>
<p>Help us spread more joy.</p>

<p><strong>Meet SymBowl &amp; Find Your Inner Flavor</strong></p>
<p>SymBowl is a healthy, fast-casual restaurant located in Kirkwood, Chesterfield and St. Charles that focuses on specialty diets such as gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, vegan, paleo and more. SymBowl also offers whole fruit smoothies and fresh juices made to order. The customizable menu utilizes healthy recipes for a fresh, whole-food meal.  Since opening in 2012, we have evolved into a crazy, quirky hybrid: part juice and smoothie bar, part fast-casual “steam-fry” shop.</p>
<p>Over arching all of this is our commitment to using whole food ingredients, local products and providing great versatility in our menu. We are the place that uses ingredients from the “perimeter” of the grocery store.</p>
<p>We have developed auto immune protocol friendly dressings and sauces that incorporate global, fresh flavors pleasing to all customers. Our goal is for our customers following restrictive, healing protocols to be able to enjoy dinner at home with their families.  No more stress of preparing two meals or feeling left out.  </p>
<p>The first two products we are determined to make widely available are the No Tomato Pasta Sauce and the No Tomato BBQ sauce.  Kate from <a href=""http://www.thebejuledlife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bejuled Life</a> makes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqAKqPKkXx8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a quick dinner with her kids using our Pasta Sauce here</a>.  </p>
<p>What makes our products different? Check out these ingredient lists:</p>
<p><strong>Pasta Sauce:</strong> Carrot, Beet, Onion, Garlic, Raisin, Salt, Lemon, Basil </p>
<p><strong>BBQ Sauce:</strong> Raisin, Onion, Garlic, Celery, Cinnamon, Sea Salt, Clove, Beet, Carrot, Apple Cider Vinegar</p>
<p>Find Your Inner Flavor is much more than a line of sauces and dressings used in our SymBowl restaurants.  It is an educational and community building platform that Greg and Becky use to connect customers with information, experts, opportunities and methods of healing.  Check out our podcasts featuring a variety of guests at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXartIg8ryihVu-xm9h3wsA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our YouTube channel</a>. </p>
<p>We know the difference we have made in the lives of our St. Louis community.  Through Yelp, Facebook and other social media we have met many travelers that ""wish there was a SymBowl in my city!""  The need for lifestyle food is increasing and we can begin our eventual journey across the country with our product line of sauces.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We need $30,000 to begin to test-batch, bottle our sauces and distribute on a larger scale.  Our sauces are made of whole foods, no pre-packaged purees.  We have had a challenging time finding packers and suppliers that can help us scale our sauce production to the next level, but we are getting there.  </p>
<p>Chef Gregory Owens has been developing sauces and trouble shooting the distribution process while overseeing the 3 current SymBowl locations and contributing to Find Your Inner Flavor podcasts.  Our Crowdfund will allow Greg to focus on recipe development and streamlining the product line.  </p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>Our Crowdfund Perks are unique to SymBowl &amp; Find Your Inner Flavor and will please our current customer base and new Symbowl/Find Your Inner Flavor fans.  Customers can enjoy full sized bottles of our sauces, special Ambassador status at Symbowl restaurants or opportunities to spend personal time with Chef Greg &amp; Becky.  You can also donate to the National Kidney Foundation on behalf of Wes, one of our Chef/Managers.  You can check out his story <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L2Os3LyrF8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on our podcast!</a></p>
<p>If Find Your Inner Flavor does not reach the entirety of our $30,000 crowdfunding goal, we will devote all funds to our original mission of developing, production and distribution of our existing product line, but to a smaller audience.  We opened our first restaurant with $300 left in our checking account and we made it work.  We have expanded slowly and surely over the years, avoiding multiple opportunities to take food quality short cuts that would have saved us money, but we stuck to our mission and we made it work.  We will continue to make it work, but with your support we can flourish on a faster and larger scale! </p>
<p>We need your support! We know we can make a difference. It happens each and every day in our restaurants. We appreciate any donations to our Crowdfund and we appreciate all social media shares, or personal invitations to contribute.  If you have a story that resonates with our mission of food as medicine, please share it! Plant a seed with friends and family that they have the power to live differently through daily choices.  </p>

SymBowl is a healthy, fast-casual restaurant located in Kirkwood, Chesterfield and St. Charles that focuses on specialty diets such as gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, vegan, paleo and more. SymBowl also offers whole fruit smoothies and fresh juices made to order. The customizable menu utilizes healthy recipes for a fresh, whole-food meal.  Since opening in 2012, we have evolved into a crazy, quirky hybrid: part juice and smoothie bar, part fast-casual “steam-fry” shop.
Over arching all of this is our commitment to using whole food ingredients, local products and providing great versatility in our menu. We are the place that uses ingredients from the “perimeter” of the grocery store.
We have developed auto immune protocol friendly dressings and sauces that incorporate global, fresh flavors pleasing to all customers. Our goal is for our customers following restrictive, healing protocols to be able to enjoy dinner at home with their families.  No more stress of preparing two meals or feeling left out.  
The first two products we are determined to make widely available are the No Tomato Pasta Sauce and the No Tomato BBQ sauce.  Kate from The Bejuled Life makes a quick dinner with her kids using our Pasta Sauce here.  
What makes our products different? Check out these ingredient lists:
Pasta Sauce: Carrot, Beet, Onion, Garlic, Raisin, Salt, Lemon, Basil 
BBQ Sauce: Raisin, Onion, Garlic, Celery, Cinnamon, Sea Salt, Clove, Beet, Carrot, Apple Cider Vinegar
Find Your Inner Flavor is much more than a line of sauces and dressings used in our SymBowl restaurants.  It is an educational and community building platform that Greg and Becky use to connect customers with information, experts, opportunities and methods of healing.  Check out our podcasts featuring a variety of guests at our YouTube channel. 
We know the difference we have made in the lives of our St. Louis community.  Through Yelp, Facebook and other social media we have met many travelers that ""wish there was a SymBowl in my city!""  The need for lifestyle food is increasing and we can begin our eventual journey across the country with our product line of sauces.  
What We Need & What You Get

We need $30,000 to begin to test-batch, bottle our sauces and distribute on a larger scale.  Our sauces are made of whole foods, no pre-packaged purees.  We have had a challenging time finding packers and suppliers that can help us scale our sauce production to the next level, but we are getting there.  
Chef Gregory Owens has been developing sauces and trouble shooting the distribution process while overseeing the 3 current SymBowl locations and contributing to Find Your Inner Flavor podcasts.  Our Crowdfund will allow Greg to focus on recipe development and streamlining the product line.  
Perks
Our Crowdfund Perks are unique to SymBowl & Find Your Inner Flavor and will please our current customer base and new Symbowl/Find Your Inner Flavor fans.  Customers can enjoy full sized bottles of our sauces, special Ambassador status at Symbowl restaurants or opportunities to spend personal time with Chef Greg & Becky.  You can also donate to the National Kidney Foundation on behalf of Wes, one of our Chef/Managers.  You can check out his story on our podcast!
If Find Your Inner Flavor does not reach the entirety of our $30,000 crowdfunding goal, we will devote all funds to our original mission of developing, production and distribution of our existing product line, but to a smaller audience.  We opened our first restaurant with $300 left in our checking account and we made it work.  We have expanded slowly and surely over the years, avoiding multiple opportunities to take food quality short cuts that would have saved us money, but we stuck to our mission and we made it work.  We will continue to make it work, but with your support we can flourish on a faster and larger scale! 
We need your support! We know we can make a difference. It happens each and every day in our restaurants. We appreciate any donations to our Crowdfund and we appreciate all social media shares, or personal invitations to contribute.  If you have a story that resonates with our mission of food as medicine, please share it! Plant a seed with friends and family that they have the power to live differently through daily choices.  
Continue letting us know how we can help you to eat well and live well! Our restaurant and products have evolved to meet your needs and we will keep growing!

in downtown Atlanta, GA.  With over 25 years of experience in retail sales, commercial property management, hospitality management, &amp; general project management, I moved to Atlanta, GA and co-founded (with my sister) The Boxcar Grocer in an underserved community.  The Boxcar Grocer was a healthy corner market that sold quality food products and flourished before closing its doors in 2015.  The following year I launched Quintessential, a brand development company that concepts, brands, and executes integrated boutique hospitality experiences. In 2017, we hosted a 5-part speaker series titled, “Hospitality &amp; Retail in the New Atlanta"" before launching Quintessential’s first brand Parlor in 2018.  Over the last decade I have worked with our community to redefine the landscape of one of Atlanta’s most unique neighborhoods, Castleberry Hill, and continue to push for the positive development of our community.  </p><p>Our campaign is about growing the business and scaling the brand up.  We are looking to move from our 800 sq. ft. space into a space that is 2,000+ sq. ft.  By moving into a larger space it would allow us to build out a kitchen, have a larger bar, and triple our seating capacity for guests.  While this would all equal increasing our revenue, it also means being able to employee 3-4 times as many people from our community, work with more artists of color, engage with more musicians, and collaborate with more culinary professionals.  All of this engagement would ultimately allow us to be a blueprint for black-owned hospitality in Atlanta and a beacon of inspiration for food &amp; beverage everywhere, while positively affecting the long-term development of our community.</p><p><b><u>Our Goal</u></b></p><p>Our goal with this campaign is to raise $750K.  The funds will be used to:</p><p> $600,000 – Project Development, Design &amp; Construction</p><p>$100,000 – Restructure Current Debt</p><p>$50,000 – Operating Expenses</p><p><u><strong>Our Thanks To You</strong></u></p><p>Contributors will receive:</p><p><i><strong>Donations of $100 - $1000</strong></i></p><p>~ Recognition in our monthly newsletter</p><p>~

owner, chef, and bartender</p><p>~ Lifetime free access to our Social Club</p><p><u><strong>Parlor's Impact</strong></u></p><p>We believe that Parlor has the tremendous opportunity to positively change the landscape of the hospitality industry for African-Americans in Atlanta. Part of our business model is to be a springboard for Black chefs, cooks, bartenders, artists, musicians, and various vendors to be seen, heard, and experienced.  This is something we successfully accomplished with The Boxcar Grocer during which time we were the first retailer to showcase products like Chuice beverages, Southern Culture pancake mix, and Just Add Honey tea products (just to name a few). </p><p>Also, just like The Boxcar Grocer, Parlor acts as a meet up space for people in our community that allows them to feel safe, relaxed, and have access to individuals they might not normally get an opportunity to meet in their daily circles. For many communities of color, safe SPACE is a valuable, and sometimes rare, commodity that serves as community center, networking platform, political engagement hub, and social arena.  This is what transpired with The Boxcar Grocer and THIS is what happens when people walk through the doors of Parlor.  People engage with people.</p><p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p><p>As with any new venture, there are risks &amp; challenges to realizing the full potential of the project.  We know that brand awareness and brand connectivity will be our largest challenge as this is a national campaign and we are a very local brand here in Atlanta. But while we know many people have not heard of us, we believe that it’s exactly this kind of hyper local focus that makes us unique.  Our story is not uncommon, as many local brands can be more helpful &amp; impactful in their communities with a wider swath of national support behind them. There are many local businesses that can serve as a lighthouse of inspiration for their communities and fellow business owners by being better capitalized and having access to resources that allow them to flourish with a proper team and operation in places.  Our ability to overcome this hurdle will be guided by intimate brand storytelling and getting in front of the right people. We are confident that once people understand who we are and what we are trying to accomplish we will accomplish our goal.  This will be done by way of intentional social media outreach, on-site communications, a strong online presence, and making sure that we continue to tell our compelling story.</p><p><u><strong>Other Ways YOU Can Help</strong></u></p><p><strong>Posting instructions for Instagram: </strong></p><p>Please place the IndieGoGo link in your

<h3>What is Waffle-lot?</h3>
<p>Seriously, who doesn't love Waffles? That's where Waffle Lot started, Just a pure love of the deliciousness and versatility of waffles. They can be a breakfast, lunch, or dinner item, and and that's what Waffle Lot wants to build on.</p>
<p>My name is Marcel, and I'm a co-owner of Waffle Lot.  I'm honestly just a normal person that has always had a passion for cooking for people and providing smiles. In the small amount of time Waffle Lot has been active its provided just that; food and smiles.</p>
<p>Our campaign is just a way for kickstarting Waffle Lot to achieve its ultimate goal of opening a small cafe where people can come relax and enjoy waffles at any time of day. For now, we'll settle for a place where we can sell you waffles on the go, so you can enjoy a quick bite as you go about your day. Our $5,000 goal is a small goal to help us with the different licenses we need, some more supplies, and even provide us with the ability to market our business further.</p>
<p>Waffle Lot has a ton of awesome plans including unique menu items and events. Remember, Waffle Lot was founded on the premise of spreading happiness through our food. To do this we will be giving back to those in need in two special ways. First, Waffle Lot will help feed the hungry by donating unsold food. Secondly, we will be donating a portion of our special event proceeds to schools.</p>
<p>Overall Waffle Lot wants to provide smiles, food, and a warm welcoming environment, unlike most big brand restaurants. We want to see people as excited about each waffle as we are. So please feel free to donate any amount to help our cause. Visit our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Wafflelot717/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook page</a> or our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/wafflelot717/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram page</a> and give us a like.

A Word From The Founder



 
 



 
 





We have teamed up with artist Jonah Allen to design packaging that we believe is truly a work of art.  These tubes are not only beautiful but also free of plastic!
 
You can see more of Jonah's work at his site:

jonahallen.com (opens in new window)

 
 


 
 


Why shouldn't you be able to customize the colors of the straws that you want to carry?  

 



Turn your straws into telastrås.  Decide how long you want your straw to be!  


 
 
 


The lastrå clip allows you to attach your lastrå kit to a bag, coat, clothes, anything you want to secure it to.  
 
 
 
 

You asked us for an additional pipe cleaner, we couldn't say no! 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 


 


     
 
 


Inspire change by offering beautiful and brag-worthy alternatives to disposable plastics, and support the removal of plastics from the oceans.
 
 

 


 
One thing that excites me even more than setting lastrå free to the world is the potential that this release has to bring about lasting change.  Once the company is established, we will launch the Ocean Clean Up Program where the lastrå community will see the true power of the dollar.  A percentage of each lastrå sale will go towards ocean clean up and towards preventing more plastics from entering our oceans and waterways.  
 

The program will focus on supporting and backing programs that have already been proven successful.  We will also lobby cities, states, governments, and countries to enact legislation to stop the ever-increasing flow of plastics into landfills and the oceans.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Contrary to what some people believe, Brewer X is not related to Racer X.  At this time, we cannot disclose Brewer X’s identify because:</span></p>
<p>a)  Brewer X is really a super-secret spy for the Fed who happens to be a gifted brewer;</p>
<p>b)  Brewer X is wanted in 5 star systems for collaborating with the rebel scum to overthrow the Galactic Empire;</p>
<p>c)  Brewer X is currently employed by another brewery and if said brewery learns of his plans to defect to a rival brewery, he will lose his membership in the Brewers Guild.</p>
<p>If you chose A or B, there’s this bridge in London I want to sell you.  All kidding aside, we have an experienced and incredibly talented brewer who will be running the show from day one.  Our brewer is currently with another successful brewery but he feels the need to move on and follow his vision of brewing solid recipes and running his own shop.  Working and learning from some of the best brewers out there and living the dream, Brewer X has gained the knowledge and experience that will position VKBC for success.  We can't wait for the big reveal and for you to meet him.  Brewer X runs a very tight ship with the core of the team doing double or triple duties.  We may even rely on some of you to help with a few things here and there and your reward is a cold pint of beer.  And maybe a sandwich if Brewer X is feeling generous.</p>
<p>Our consultant tells us running a brewery is a lot of hard work.  It has to be something you believe in and would be willing to make sacrifices just to keep the doors open and the kettle boiling.  We think this is a worthwhile endeavor, something we'll pour (pun intended) our hearts and soul into because the belief in the vision is worth the risk.  Don’t laugh but for us, brewing beer is a labor of love.  This is only the beginning of a wonderful journey and more chapters will be written.  Your name will be alongside ours when the story is printed and no matter the amount, your contribution will help start this brewery.  You can also help spread the word; tell your family, friends, neighbors, folks at the office, tell everybody that we are building a brewery in Frankfort and we could use their help.</p>

We’ve got four flagship beers at the get go:

Scalliwag in a Barrel:  A salute to Billy’s pirating days, we brew this ale with a wee bit of dark malt and lighten up the hops; gives it a malty finish.  Malty, rhymes with salty, which is Billy’s outlook on life.

Contrary to what some people believe, Brewer X is not related to Racer X.  At this time, we cannot disclose Brewer X’s identify because:
a)  Brewer X is really a super-secret spy for the Fed who happens to be a gifted brewer;
b)  Brewer X is wanted in 5 star systems for collaborating with the rebel scum to overthrow the Galactic Empire;
c)  Brewer X is currently employed by another brewery and if said brewery learns of his plans to defect to a rival brewery, he will lose his membership in the Brewers Guild.
If you chose A or B, there’s this bridge in London I want to sell you.  All kidding aside, we have an experienced and incredibly talented brewer who will be running the show from day one.  Our brewer is currently with another successful brewery but he feels the need to move on and follow his vision of brewing solid recipes and running his own shop.  Working and learning from some of the best brewers out there and living the dream, Brewer X has gained the knowledge and experience that will position VKBC for success.  We can't wait for the big reveal and for you to meet him.  Brewer X runs a very tight ship with the core of the team doing double or triple duties.  We may even rely on some of you to help with a few things here and there and your reward is a cold pint of beer.  And maybe a sandwich if Brewer X is feeling generous.
Our consultant tells us running a brewery is a lot of hard work.  It has to be something you believe in and would be willing to make sacrifices just to keep the doors open and the kettle boiling.  We think this is a worthwhile endeavor, something we'll pour (pun intended) our hearts and soul into because the belief in the vision is worth the risk.  Don’t laugh but for us, brewing beer is a labor of love.  This is only the beginning of a wonderful journey and more chapters will be written.  Your name will be alongside ours when the story is printed and no matter the amount, your contribution will help start this brewery.  You can also help spread the word; tell your family, friends, neighbors, folks at the office, tell everybody that we are building a brewery in Frankfort and we could use their help.
For those of you intrigued and interested enough to participate as an equity owner, send a note to will@villagekettlebrewing.com and we'll send you some information. Thank you for helping us make the Village Kettle Brewing Company a reality!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The January 2015 issue of the New Brewer expects craft brewing to own 20% of the market by 2020. However, the Brazos Valley in Texas is currently under-served by breweries and brewpubs compared to many other University locations and we have created an awesome brewing destination in old town Bryan, TX . So . . . now what? Now we need you to come play.</p>
<p>You may have seen brewery cooperatives but a Zoiglbrewery is more than that. Instead of you just being a member, you can join the corporation and share the brewery. We have a place to learn, a place to just have fun. We are bringing the home brewers out of the backyard providing an outlet to ‘step it up a notch’ - or teach you how to do so.</p>
<p>Game on?</p> <h3>Background</h3>We are a small brewery that opened our taproom January, 2016 and are having so much fun with what we are doing that we cut a trailer (as you've seen above) and need you to come have some fun too. We are currently raising money for expansion. We will be taking over the rest of the building we are in and setting down 20 barrels worth of production equipment. Right now we are finishing the build-out of the beer garden. If you want to brew, you have to become an officer of the company. If you want swag, here's your opportunity. Either way, we are here for you (and for the beer).<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500053510/jgktpqoghwnygji9dadt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>A Zoiglbrewery (Zoiglbraurei) is a concept in brewing and distribution dating back to the 15th century, but currently found only in a small region of Eastern Bavaria close to the Czech Republic. The brewers (Kommunbrauer) share the calendar days for brewing depending on their level of involvement in the brewery.</p>
<p>The name Zoigl is a Bavarian word derived from the German word ""Zeigen"" meaning sign.The brewer hangs the Zoigl when his or her beer is ready as an invitation to the neighbors to come over and have some beer. The town becomes a revolving pub of sorts and a treasure hunt ensues to find the next Zoigl, and the next fresh Zoiglbeer.

The ""scaling up"" part is where your help is needed.</p>
<p>This has been a cumbersome affair setting this concept down under Texas laws but we have a handle on it. We opened as a manufacturer so we could get permit submitted and the beer garden opened. We will be converting to a Brewpub which will be on the retailer level, so restaurants and clubs can develop recipes too. In Texas you have to be an officer of the corporation to come brew, and we can make that happen in the rewards section. Right now we are spending all of our beer sales revenue on upgrades and could sure use your help.  It's such a fun concept  that right now we just want to get the story of Zoiglbeer out there.</p>

<h3><b>How Funds Will be Used</b></h3>
<p>Funds raised through this campaign will cover materials and equipment for the expansion and you're helping us. We're asking for enough to cover any little or large part of the build-out. There are a lot of costs to cover and any little bit helps.</p>If we exceed the fundraising goal with your help we will keep applying any excess to making the Zoigl<i> </i>better and better.

</h3> <p>Heavy Metal Ice Cream was conceptualized over several weeks of fun brainstorming between myself (Jay Smith, Crestwood, Mo.) and my 11 year old Daughter, Chloe. In short, we both love food, cooking together, and who DOESN'T LOVE ICE CREAM?!?!<br/><br/>Most importantly, the driving force between my wanting to open this parlor is the hopes to start a family business with the one person I trust most in the world and has never let me down. My little girl. Making her smile or laugh makes my day, but  starting a family business that we would live, breathe and love TOGETHER? That would make my life complete.<br/><br/>Now, obviously due to her age Chloe would not be a true employee, but believe me she'll be the main consultant and 50% of the creative force until the day she can work legitimately. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why ""Heavy Metal"" Ice Cream???</b></p>
<p>Growing up in the late 80's / Early 90's, I was a Metal Head through and through. I picked up a guitar at 13 and learned from the greats. Van Halen, Hair Bands, Classic Rock, Metal...all of it consumed me. And though being a full fledged rock star never panned out, I have made some pretty decent money and success playing in some wildly popular St. Louis cover bands over the years. Somehow, the dichotomy of Heavy Metal's abrasiveness mixed with the soft, fluffy yumminess of Ice Cream just seemed to SCREAM....""Whoa, this is a GREAT idea!""</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Makes Your Ice Cream So Special?!<br/>
</h3>
<p>There are SEVERAL Gourmet Ice Cream shops in the St. Louis area and we love and respect them all! Here is where we feel we are different...and awesome!<br/><br/><i>Heavy Metal Ice Cream whenever possible 
will always use fresh, organic ingredients from local farmers, dairies, 
hatcheries, and farmers markets. Our Ice Cream has an expiration date 
just like the big chains. But instead of nearly a month, ours is 3 days from the
 morning the batch was made fresh. What goes beyond that is discarded 
for a fresh new batch or donated to local soup kitchens and shelters for the homeless and shelters for battered women.<br/> <br/> Also, while not divulging our recipe for
 our base, sweet scream Ice Cream, we will share that we WILL use as 
many local farm raised egg yolks per batch just this side of crossing 
over from being able to call it ice cream and it becoming technically 
frozen custard. Ole' Ted Down the street has the corner on that market 
and we are NOT trying to step on those toes...as if we could. Nothing 
but respect to the Original Gangsta of St. Louis frozen treats!<br/> <br/>
 Also, our flavors and rich, custardy, velvety texture are what sets us 
apart ALONG WITH our wild flavors and scoop names. Here's what you WON'T
 find in our shop.<br/>  - NO Neon, Tutti Fruity, Super Loud artificially
 colored Ice Cream. Rarely, we will use a couple of drops if it suits 
the theme of the cone, but most times, you get the natural color of the 
batch plus whatever mix-ins are in the ice cream<br/>  - NO glass jars of
 run of the mill toppings. You're not gonna find sprinkles in this 
joint. No cookie dough balls, crushed peanuts, bland chocolate chips or 
stale coconut sprinkles. Our Scoops and Mix-In's stand on their own<br/> 
 - NO generic or store bought cones! All of our waffle cones are made in
 house on our own irons using our own, secret, sweet butter-milky 
recipe. Mmmm....can you smell THAT?!<br/>  - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.... NO 
tiny scoops or servings. Our cones runeth over. A common complain about 
other gourmet shops. We may not be the cheapest cone in town, but you 
WILL get your money's worth!</i><br/></p>

I attended the Lindbergh School District from Kindergarten through Senior Year Graduation. But my little hometown saw a mighty rise in the 80's and a sad crushing fall in the last decade. In short, <b>I want to give back. </b>Crestwood was mostly supported by one of the first ever wildly successful Shopping Malls. But factors ranging from the dot com shopping boom, to slum lord management taking over the mall, to other malls opening closer to highway exits....it met a sad end a few years back. The good news, the property that has sat dormant, falling apart, and molding for years now, is to be demolished and newly redeveloped over the next couple of years. Oddly enough.... right in line with our projected storefront opening. We, Heavy Metal Ice Cream, want to be there front and center.

NOT for the actual storefront location opening. That will be ""Phase 3"". Contributors to each level will qualify for some REALLY cool perks to be given out once each phase's goal is reached!<br/></p> <ul> <li>Phase 1 - Acquire basic kitchen materials such as a
 top of the line non-commercial ice cream maker, various kitchen 
supplies, and stock up on ingredients. In this phase we spend 6-10 
months concocting our various flavors after first perfecting our perfect
 vanilla, sweet scream, Ice Cream base. At this point it will be tested 
among friends and family to see what flies and what doesn't make the 
cut. In this phase we will not be allowed to sell our product. We also 
use this phase to secure legal advice, our official trademarking 
process, and have 3 sessions with a business planning firm.<br/> This will require our first of 3 <a href=""http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FIndieGoGo.com%2F&amp;h=OAQGFop4W&amp;s=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IndieGoGo.com</a> campaigns.<br/>
</li> <li>Phase 2 - Rental of a Culinary Incubator. (A 
building with multiple commercial kitchens that have already passed 
inspection and rent their space by the hour or day to chefs learning the
 ropes and perfecting their methods.) At this point after being given 
the ok by the Mo. Dept. Of Health, we can begin selling and shipping in 
small batches for minor profits and begin ""catching a buzz"" around town 
and building anticipation and a fan base. These kitchens can range in 
price from $20 an hour to $200 per day. Many, MANY days will be required
 and that adds up. This will require a 2nd <a href=""http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FIndieGoGo.com%2F&amp;h=aAQHnMjft&amp;s=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IndieGoGo.com</a> campaign</li> <li>Phase 3 - This is where we put the pedal to the 
METAL. We acquire a storefront rental space. We hope to secure one on 
historic route 66. We build our kitchen, build out the decor, install 
freezers, machines, scoop counters, and furniture and hopefully, open to
 critical acclaim and great local success, all in thanks to you, our 
amazing supporters, contributors, and backers!</li> </ul> </div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not everyone can contribute. We totally get that!

Your contribution won't just be to help start a family business, but breathe life back into a community many have given up on.
  What We Need & What You Get We plan to operate in 3 phases each with it's own individual IndieGoGo campaign. Please be aware that THIS campaign is for ""Phase 1"". NOT for the actual storefront location opening. That will be ""Phase 3"". Contributors to each level will qualify for some REALLY cool perks to be given out once each phase's goal is reached!  Phase 1 - Acquire basic kitchen materials such as a
 top of the line non-commercial ice cream maker, various kitchen 
supplies, and stock up on ingredients. In this phase we spend 6-10 
months concocting our various flavors after first perfecting our perfect
 vanilla, sweet scream, Ice Cream base. At this point it will be tested 
among friends and family to see what flies and what doesn't make the 
cut. In this phase we will not be allowed to sell our product. We also 
use this phase to secure legal advice, our official trademarking 
process, and have 3 sessions with a business planning firm. This will require our first of 3 IndieGoGo.com campaigns.
 Phase 2 - Rental of a Culinary Incubator. (A 
building with multiple commercial kitchens that have already passed 
inspection and rent their space by the hour or day to chefs learning the
 ropes and perfecting their methods.) At this point after being given 
the ok by the Mo. Dept. Of Health, we can begin selling and shipping in 
small batches for minor profits and begin ""catching a buzz"" around town 
and building anticipation and a fan base. These kitchens can range in 
price from $20 an hour to $200 per day. Many, MANY days will be required
 and that adds up. This will require a 2nd IndieGoGo.com campaign Phase 3 - This is where we put the pedal to the 
METAL. We acquire a storefront rental space. We hope to secure one on 
historic route 66. We build our kitchen, build out the decor, install 
freezers, machines, scoop counters, and furniture and hopefully, open to
 critical acclaim and great local success, all in thanks to you, our 
amazing supporters, contributors, and backers!   Other Ways You Can Help Not everyone can contribute. We totally get that! So here are some other ways you can help if you believe in us:  Share Our Campaign On Facebook and ask others to consider contributing

<p>Hello, Friends!</p>
<p>As many of you know, we've made a big commitment to downtown Allentown over the past year, reflecting our family's history in the city and my own work for the last 7 years as an advocate around the issues of urban food insecurity, homelessness and sheltering, poverty, access, and good governance.  </p>
<p><strong>Our business has grown very quickly over the last 3 years in general</strong>.  In this short amount of time we've expanded our footprint in mobile concessions with new stands and revenue streams at the Kutztown Folk Festival, our two food trucks, and our brick-and-mortar operations in Lynnville and Downtown Allentown.   </p>
<p>Right now, as the slow season with the mobile part of our business (which is the more profitable part) comes to an end, and we look to spring and summer, I'm looking for people interested in helping us bridge the gap to the busy season. If you'd be interested in helping us continue to invest in the business and in downtown Allentown, I'm looking for a three-month term at 5% (annualized).  I'm interested in investments of all sizes, from micro loans of a few hundred dollars on.  For smaller amounts, and for some big ones, we've set up some fun perks in addition to repayment.  I am looking to collectively raise $5000 - $10,000 in working capital to pay-off short-term debt and invest in continued growth.</p>
<p><strong>We just won the 2017 Lehigh Valley Style best cheesesteak award and are so proud of that in our 60th year of business!</strong> If you can help us bridge the gap between now and the busy season, please consider it and help become part of a growing good news story!

<p>After having worked in South Korea since 2010 as youngest Western professor of violin, teaching gifted students, playing many concerts and being inspired as composer from traditional Korean Gugak music it was my idea to produce an homage to this Eurasian bridge - the ""New Silk Road"" - in a globalized time - on an edible medium: chocolate.</p>

<h3><strong>Background story</strong></h3>
<p>The project already origins in summer 2016 when I was asked to write a piece for a concert in Hélène de Beauvoirs former house in idyllical Goxwiller in Alsace. The title of the piece is ""Bernstein &amp; Co"" for violin, clarinet, cello &amp; piano. It also includes the audience and performance of all players.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576522437/nms6widbwshboekwngm1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Later I was asked to compose a piece for violin and string orchestra for a performance in Seoul in April 2017. So I took two pieces from the quartet ""Bernstein &amp; Co"": ""Emerald"" (Orient) &amp; ""Rubin"" (Asia). I thought about theses jewels, their geological appearance and decided to finish my new piece with ""Andalusit"", a mineral one can find in Spain. This represents Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576522945/agismkpmny8esmzd6udp.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576523247/x1reni0qokew5ybe1xpc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Then ""Silk Road"" and after arranging it for a unique ensemble with typical EurAsian instruments  ""New Silk Road"" was born with a span from far East Asia to Western Europe, nowadays a trade route probably beyond the whole space.</p>
<p>Originally it was planned performing ""New Silk Road"" with Virtuosi in Munich.  We realised that our journey wanted to reach out a der audience: By coincidence I found Wohlfarth Gläserne Schokoladenmanufaktur in Berlin in summer 2019. I was immediately impressed by the chocolate record as I really could die for chocolate. It came to my mind like a flash finding this ""musical"" space inside of us humans. A synesthesia  of taste &amp; music -  food inspired by Pythagoras and the Ancient Chinese! They even had used and theoretically systematised  the interval of the Third thousands of years (!) earlier before Oriental countries and the Ancient Greece. However, later the Chinese did not use these intervals - so one even could wonder if Plato took the knowledge of them and forbid certain scales in music because of evoking certain statues of affects he did not want to be practiced in his Academia? </p>
<p><strong>Welcome all chocolate and sound GOURMETS on our ""New Silk Road"" journey!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The whole project included:</strong></h2>
<p>1. Composing, arranging and editing the music, copy costs</p>
<p>2. Rehearsing with Virtuosi in Berlin for one week. </p>
<p>    Excellent clarinet player Francesco Petri came extra from Saarbrücken and</p>
<p>    inspiring Johannes Schubert took his zither from Fulda to Berlin.</p>

<h3>This chocolate record: a WOW</h3>
<p>This world wide unique chocolate record ""New Silk Road"" is sustainable and 100% ecological made from vegan chocolate fed with green electricity. Wohlfarth chocolate has won several prizes in important chocolate competitions.</p>
<p>My colleagues, Virtuosi, are musicians of highest caliber. We are an international team (flute, clarinet, violin, cello, saz, piano, harp, zither, gayageum) and share musical background from Eurasian cultures. I used the string set of harp - zither - gayageum (a kind of Korean harp) to show the rich sound palette of this trio, combinations of silk, gut, steel with silver-golden mounted strings of violin, cello and even nylon of the Oriental saz.</p>
<p>""New Silk Road"" feels like film music and my conception is based on this idea:""Emerald"" tells through maqam scales in a long melodic line the mythological story of the Egyptian God of Wisdom, the Moon and Writing ""Thoth"" whose scriptum can be seen on an Emerald tablet. ""Rubin"" shows pentatonics and Asian lightness, referring to Thoth´s words in the Coda while all musicians improvise. ""Andalusit"" combines the Malaguena cadence scheme with Korean rhythm Chinyangjo and is a very fast, energetic movement.</p>
<p>Next to performing international concerts, my CDs (Hänssler, Oehms) received excellent reviews from journals such as American Record Guide, Fono Forum, Pizzicato, was awarded with the American Critic´s Choice and three Echo Klassik nominations. My Ysaye CD is benchmarked among the top 3 world wide. So the music on this chocolate record is of finest quality, performed with my outstanding colleagues on highest level.</p>
<p>Enjoy a caleidoscopic sensuous experience! Listen and eat ""New Silk Road"" in your concert hall at home and cook with it in your kitchen a nice cake with spices from the Silk Road such as kardamom, cinnamon, vanilla, rose, pepper e.g. What about inviting your friends and sharing all your impressions on social media - Make the ""New Silk Road"" grow further!</p>

After having worked in South Korea since 2010 as youngest Western professor of violin, teaching gifted students, playing many concerts and being inspired as composer from traditional Korean Gugak music it was my idea to produce an homage to this Eurasian bridge - the ""New Silk Road"" - in a globalized time - on an edible medium: chocolate.
YOU can help us through supporting this campaign!
THEN we can play more wonderful international live concerts together, share music and above all the best artisan chocolate - as functioning sounding chocolate record.​ YOU will never forget the taste of this music and record with its nice scents of cacao beans and: YOU will have enormous FUN with this round product.

 
Background story
The project already origins in summer 2016 when I was asked to write a piece for a concert in Hélène de Beauvoirs former house in idyllical Goxwiller in Alsace. The title of the piece is ""Bernstein & Co"" for violin, clarinet, cello & piano. It also includes the audience and performance of all players.

Later I was asked to compose a piece for violin and string orchestra for a performance in Seoul in April 2017. So I took two pieces from the quartet ""Bernstein & Co"": ""Emerald"" (Orient) & ""Rubin"" (Asia). I thought about theses jewels, their geological appearance and decided to finish my new piece with ""Andalusit"", a mineral one can find in Spain. This represents Europe.
 

Then ""Silk Road"" and after arranging it for a unique ensemble with typical EurAsian instruments  ""New Silk Road"" was born with a span from far East Asia to Western Europe, nowadays a trade route probably beyond the whole space.
Originally it was planned performing ""New Silk Road"" with Virtuosi in Munich.  We realised that our journey wanted to reach out a der audience: By coincidence I found Wohlfarth Gläserne Schokoladenmanufaktur in Berlin in summer 2019. I was immediately impressed by the chocolate record as I really could die for chocolate. It came to my mind like a flash finding this ""musical"" space inside of us humans. A synesthesia  of taste & music -  food inspired by Pythagoras and the Ancient Chinese! They even had used and theoretically systematised  the interval of the Third thousands of years (!) earlier before Oriental countries and the Ancient Greece. However, later the Chinese did not use these intervals - so one even could wonder if Plato took the knowledge of them and forbid certain scales in music because of evoking certain statues of affects he did not want to be practiced in his Academia? 
Welcome all chocolate and sound GOURMETS on our ""New Silk Road"" journey!
 
The whole project included:
1. Composing, arranging and editing the music, copy costs
2. Rehearsing with Virtuosi in Berlin for one week. 
    Excellent clarinet player Francesco Petri came extra from Saarbrücken and
    inspiring Johannes Schubert took his zither from Fulda to Berlin.

Rehearsal in Berlin´s Osterkirche: Youjin Sung (Gayageum), Yaoyao Brandenburg (piano), Francesco Petri (clarinet), Katharina Hanstedt (harp) and Viktoria
3. Recording Sessions at HM Studios in Berlin Schoeneberg, May 2nd/3rd, 2019

4. Video Session at Workstadt Berlin on May 4th/5th, 2019. Nuno Martini and Diego Sapienzia filmed a whole night in the wonderful atelier of Dieter Menzel (Lumenzel): https://lumenzel.wordpress.com
I had written a precise screenplay focusing on solo parts of each instrument, chamber music sets while the musical dramaturgy and the whole ensemble.
We changed our clothes three times according to the colours of Emerald (green), Rubin (red) and Andalusit (golden). Harp player Katharina Hanstedt told me she had taken her harp home - the first time in her long life as thought-after musicians, also and especially for modern music - AFTER sunrise.

Cuida de tu cuerpo y cuida del medioambiente.Becrit es el ingrediente perfecto para tus recetas proteicas saludables.     Esta Proteína de Doble Alta Calidad se creó para cubrir las necesidades de una nueva generación fitness que desea cuidarse comiendo productos saludables mientras respetan su cuerpo y la naturaleza que les rodea. Con esto en mente, hemos diseñado Becrit con la proteína más revolucionaria. Sabiendo que la ganadería representa el 15% de los gases de efecto invernadero, es imperativo que hemos de encontrar nuevas fuentes de proteína sostenibles para nuestro planeta.     Muchos vegetarianos están dispuestos a comer insectos por 2 razones:
Es un alimento muy sostenible con el medio ambiente y no supone ningún peligro para el calentamiento global.
Los insectos tienen sistema nervioso central simple sin receptores de sensibilidad, por lo tanto no sufren ningún dolor.
Ser vegetariano es una decisión personal de cada uno tomada por diferentes razones. Nosotros no comemos carne y sí comemos alimentos con proteína de insecto por su contribución nutricional y porque su producción respeta el medio ambiente.Este tipo de dieta se conoce como entovegetariana.    La harina de insecto tiene valores proteicos más altos que cualquier otro alimento natural sin procesar. Esto la hace el alimento más eficiente del mundo en términos de proteína. 

 
 Los insectos se crían en una granja de Holanda con más de 40 años de experiencia en la cría de insectos. Siguen las estrictas directivas de la UE, así que no usan antibióticos, hormonas ni pesticidas.     

 
 
   Después de meses de investigación, búsqueda y desarrollo, hemos diseñado un polvo de proteína de insecto con unos valores nutricionales impresionantes, una textura muy suave y un sabor dulce y natural.   Becrit Fresa con Chocolate Blanco y un toque de BaobabIngredientes: proteína vegetal (soja, guisante), polvo de insecto entero (Alphitobius diaperinus larvae) (14%), miel natural en polvo, betanina (jugo de remolacha en polvo), maltodextrina, arom natural, saborizante, extracto de pulpa de baobab orgánico (0,8%), espesante (goma de xantano), endulzante (sucralosa). / Alérgenos: Gluten, soja.

<h2>The Story of Crema</h2>
<p>My name is Aidan Miller, and I am 16 years old. I was born in West Africa, and after 11 years in Togo, our family moved to Rwanda with a vision of contributing to the spiritual and physical development of this beautiful recovering nation. We've been in Rwanda for 5 years now, and my family has helped start a new Christian international school, Virunga Valley Academy, where I am currently in 11th grade. This is the story of my dream to start a coffee shop in our town: Musanze, Rwanda.</p>
<h3>Our Dream</h3>

<p>Rwanda is writing a new story of hope and progress. As a part of that new story of reconciliation, we believe spaces where people can relax and connect with each other are an essential part of our city's development. Crema will be a place where people can not only find great coffee, but also experience community and celebrate creativity. Crema will contribute to the development of our community in three ways:</p>
<p>-Providing job training and employment for vulnerable youth in our community.</p>
<p>-Providing a place for creative projects to be displayed and sold, especially products that support important social projects in Rwanda like Peace House, a non-profit that helps girls come off the streets and make a living by learning to make clothes, jewelry, and accessories.</p>
<p>-Selling and promoting Question Coffee (<a href=""http://questioncoffee.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">questioncoffee.com</a>), a coffee produced by the non-profit Sustainable Harvest in partnership with two women's cooperatives in Rwanda who are growing some of the best coffee in the country.</p>

Unfortunately, there is not enough emphasis on this important aspect of care. Over the years while working as an oncologist, I realized the significant challenges we face regarding nutrition.</p><p>It really bothered me to see how patients would struggle to find a nutritional supplement that provides the necessary amount of protein, vitamins, and protective compounds. Additionally, all available supplements contain sugar.</p><p>Basically, there is no nutritional supplement specifically designed for people during chemotherapy.</p><p>These experiences motivated me to found a company whose mission is to create a nutritional supplement that is scientifically formulated specifically for this population.</p><p>Our products contain the vital ingredients necessary to help support the body in the areas most needed during chemotherapy: decrease oxidative stress, support a proper immune response, alleviate non-life threatening minor chemotherapy side effects, help with appetite, nausea, and energy. It contains vitamins, electrolytes and a special proprietary blend of probiotics. We use only the highest quality protein, and no added sugar.*</p><p>This product is designed to provide key nutritional support for the patient in order to optimize their overall quality of life, and in no way meant to replace chemo-, biological or immunotherapy. At the same time, none of the ingredients interfere with efficacy of these treatments.*</p><p> </p><h2>Why Is Nutrition Important When Receiving Chemotherapy?</h2><p>50 to 80% of cancer patients have nutritional issues. Patients simply do not get the proper nutrition to maintain lean muscle mass and weight.  They experience increased levels of oxidative stress, lack of energy, and other side effects of chemotherapy.</p><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cx3MQsdqgYQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>These additional side effects can include occasional diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, among others.</p><p>If we are able to improve nutrition, support lean muscle mass and strength, support the immune system and decrease oxidative stress, we can help maintain the overall health of these patients, and that enables us to treat people with chemotherapy more effectively. <i>This is the goal we are determined to achieve.</i></p><p> </p><h2>Ingredients From Medical Point Of View</h2><p>Our goal is to provide a nutritional supplement to deliver high quality nutrition, while providing additional benefits, including managing minor symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy treatment.</p><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9GUktgQ4ak?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>In our supplement we use a high quality, purified, natural, premium protein that is non-GMO, lactose and gluten free, and sourced from free roaming, grass fed cows that are never treated with hormones or antibiotics. It provides all essential and nonessential amino acids such as leucine, arginine, and glutamine, which help maintain muscle mass and function. There is increasing amount of evidence implying that the ketogenic diet (sugar free) is an effective adjuvant treatment for patient receiving chemotherapy.</p><p>For this reason, our supplement does not contain any added traditional carbohydrates, or added sugars. Besides promoting nutrition, our supplement contains ingredients that may help support the immune system, decrease oxidative stress and increase overall health and well-being. Among other compounds, we use zinc and nucleotides, a combination that along with omega-3 fatty acids are effective in supporting the immune system.*</p><p>L-Carnitine was shown to support a healthy weight and improve the quality of life in patients, and additionally plays a role in ameliorating chemotherapy-related fatigue.*</p><p>Scientific data indicate that quercetin helps reduce oxidative stress. L-glutamine supports liver health, whereas zinc improves appetite and taste, and ginger reduces occasional nausea and vomiting.*</p><p>While taurine helps support muscle function and cardiovascular health, beta-carotene will help to further support muscle strength and physical activity. Our supplement also provides electrolytes to maintain homeostasis, and helps rehydrate the body and prevent dehydration.*</p><p>Vitamin D and calcium are very important to help maintain strong bones. We fortify our supplement with an array of vitamins that further help with occasional digestive problems, promote immune health, and promote nerve health.*</p><p><i>PowerOnco is also unique for another reason: it contains probiotic bacteria.*</i></p><p>Probiotics stimulate both specific and nonspecific components of the immune system. There is ample evidence that probiotics can reduce oxidative stress and strengthen homeostasis, thus helping to reduce minor side effects associated with chemotherapy. Probiotics can help with occasional diarrhea and other digestive problems as well as help support the immune system.*</p><p>Our supplement fills an empty space in patient care that has never been addressed in such a comprehensive way before.</p><p> </p><h2>Nutritional Pyramid</h2><p>People with different diseases have specific nutritional needs.

POWERONCO is fortified with nucleotides to maximize immune support. POWERONCO uses only natural ingredients, has no added sugar, and contains a multipurpose proprietary probiotic blend to aid with digestive health.*  POWERONCO includes key ingredients that help support the immune system and decrease oxidative stress, which may also help alleviate the occasional non-life-threatening side effects of chemotherapy while not interfering with the effectiveness of the treatments.* Our GoalsNutronco is launching this crowdfunding campaign to accomplish three key objectives:1.  Reach our campaign goal of $100,000,which will support us in our mission to donate a 3 lb supply of PowerOnco to at least 1,000 patients in need who are currently undergoing chemotherapy.2.  Spread the word about our company, our mission, and our product; continue to raise awareness about the importance of nutrition; and grow a company that will continue to develop and revolutionize how nutrition benefits people both during and after chemotherapy.3.  Make a vital change in how the medical community approaches the treatment of disease, and spread awareness of the emerging clinical data regarding nutrition and chemotherapy.   

 
Your support is crucial to our success and the success of this campaign. Spread the word about Nutronco, share the links on social media, and in addition to helping donate these vital products to a patient in need, you will also help raise awareness and build a company that will continue to develop and revolutionize how nutrition benefits people.
 

 
Our campaign goal is to give away a minimum of 1,000 of the PowerOnco products that are scientifically formulated for chemotherapy patients and post chemotherapy.  Help us make a difference!
 Nutronco TimelineBelow is a timeline of our projected product releases, which include GuardOnco, PowerOnco+, RenewOnco, and additional product lines such as Nerve Health, Healthy Aging, and Brain Health.    Dr. Peter Acs, FounderLearn more about the founder of Nutronco, Peter Acs, MD, PhD, and what inspired him to create this easy to use, all-in-one supplement specifically designed for the unique nutritional needs of chemotherapy patients.    Dr. Peter Acs on Chemotherapy & Nutrition  Patients receiving chemotherapy face a combination of unique nutritional challenges that need to be addressed in order support their overall health and quality of life. Unfortunately, there is not enough emphasis on this important aspect of care. Over the years while working as an oncologist, I realized the significant challenges we face regarding nutrition.It really bothered me to see how patients would struggle to find a nutritional supplement that provides the necessary amount of protein, vitamins, and protective compounds. Additionally, all available supplements contain sugar.Basically, there is no nutritional supplement specifically designed for people during chemotherapy.These experiences motivated me to found a company whose mission is to create a nutritional supplement that is scientifically formulated specifically for this population.Our products contain the vital ingredients necessary to help support the body in the areas most needed during chemotherapy: decrease oxidative stress, support a proper immune response, alleviate non-life threatening minor chemotherapy side effects, help with appetite, nausea, and energy. It contains vitamins, electrolytes and a special proprietary blend of probiotics. We use only the highest quality protein, and no added sugar.*This product is designed to provide key nutritional support for the patient in order to optimize their overall quality of life, and in no way meant to replace chemo-, biological or immunotherapy. At the same time, none of the ingredients interfere with efficacy of these treatments.* Why Is Nutrition Important When Receiving Chemotherapy?50 to 80% of cancer patients have nutritional issues. Patients simply do not get the proper nutrition to maintain lean muscle mass and weight.  They experience increased levels of oxidative stress, lack of energy, and other side effects of chemotherapy.  These additional side effects can include occasional diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, among others.If we are able to improve nutrition, support lean muscle mass and strength, support the immune system and decrease oxidative stress, we can help maintain the overall health of these patients, and that enables us to treat people with chemotherapy more effectively. This is the goal we are determined to achieve. Ingredients From Medical Point Of ViewOur goal is to provide a nutritional supplement to deliver high quality nutrition, while providing additional benefits, including managing minor symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy treatment.  In our supplement we use a high quality, purified, natural, premium protein that is non-GMO, lactose and gluten free, and sourced from free roaming, grass fed cows that are never treated with hormones or antibiotics. It provides all essential and nonessential amino acids such as leucine, arginine, and glutamine, which help maintain muscle mass and function. There is increasing amount of evidence implying that the ketogenic diet (sugar free) is an effective adjuvant treatment for patient receiving chemotherapy.For this reason, our supplement does not contain any added traditional carbohydrates, or added sugars. Besides promoting nutrition, our supplement contains ingredients that may help support the immune system, decrease oxidative stress and increase overall health and well-being. Among other compounds, we use zinc and nucleotides, a combination that along with omega-3 fatty acids are effective in supporting the immune system.*L-Carnitine was shown to support a healthy weight and improve the quality of life in patients, and additionally plays a role in ameliorating chemotherapy-related fatigue.*Scientific data indicate that quercetin helps reduce oxidative stress. L-glutamine supports liver health, whereas zinc improves appetite and taste, and ginger reduces occasional nausea and vomiting.*While taurine helps support muscle function and cardiovascular health, beta-carotene will help to further support muscle strength and physical activity. Our supplement also provides electrolytes to maintain homeostasis, and helps rehydrate the body and prevent dehydration.*Vitamin D and calcium are very important to help maintain strong bones. We fortify our supplement with an array of vitamins that further help with occasional digestive problems, promote immune health, and promote nerve health.*PowerOnco is also unique for another reason: it contains probiotic bacteria.*Probiotics stimulate both specific and nonspecific components of the immune system. There is ample evidence that probiotics can reduce oxidative stress and strengthen homeostasis, thus helping to reduce minor side effects associated with chemotherapy. Probiotics can help with occasional diarrhea and other digestive problems as well as help support the immune system.*Our supplement fills an empty space in patient care that has never been addressed in such a comprehensive way before. Nutritional PyramidPeople with different diseases have specific nutritional needs. This is especially true for people receiving chemotherapy.  As an original concept we created a novel food pyramid specifically tailored for these people. This pyramid is a visual summary of the important aspects of nutritional support for this population.  Each block represents a specific area that the ingredients in the supplement will target. Essentially, the pyramid shows not what patients should eat, but the specific nutritional needs for each condition.  The strong foundation is a good quality protein based diet on which other ingredients build, with indications covering oxidative stress, immune support, organ protection, energy, appetite, nausea, vitamins, electrolytes and probiotics.*The combination of ingredients addressing these issues will provide powerful nutritional support for people undergoing chemotherapy. Connect on Social MediaVisit and follow us on social media, share and spread the word about this amazing product, and donate towards a better, healthier future!",10.0,8,"1 Campaign

<h3>From Napa to Appalachia!</h3>
<p>Elizabeth, Loren, Ava Jean and their doggies, Eli and Jackson, are known as the 'Country Gingers.' They grew up in Northern California and have always been very involved with food and wine. They stumbled upon a winery when helping their best friends move from California back to Virginia and fell in love with the beautiful land, delicious wines and gracious community. They have made the cross country trek and are thrilled to be the carrying on the Abingdon Vineyards legacy!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Next Level Needs</h3>
<p>Abingdon Vineyards is in a beautiful location, right on the South Holston River. We have 13 acres of grapes and make a wide variety of quality wines. The property is truly beautiful and deserves to be cared for and shared with the community! </p>
<p>Purchasing the winery is a long stretch for our family. With a huge mortgage and a full staff, it will be a challenge to navigate the initial growth of the winery, especially during this first winter! We also have a lot of work to do to upgrade the property to make it ideal for all of the events we would like to host for the community: wine dinners, music festivals, crawfish boils, weddings and more. This is where YOU come in! You can help us to improve the property and become part of the Abingdon Vineyards family!</p>
<p><strong>WINERY UPGRADE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade the kitchen to code for catering events - $10,000</li>
<li>Install outdoor kitchen for events - $10,000</li>
<li>Build creekside deck for stage &amp; more seating - $15,000</li>
<li>Improve furniture and fixtures for the tasting room and event room - $12,000</li>
<li>Commission more locally built picnic tables - $8,000</li>
<li>Rain cover for patio - $10,000</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also eager to plant more native North American grapes, which are adapted to our climate and are more environmentally responsible. This will ensure a long future for this local treasure!</p>
<p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY</strong></p>
<ul><li>Planting more native North American varieties that withstand frost and summer rains - $50,000 per acre</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Abingdon Vineyards has the potential to be an ideal community gathering space for live music, art, fine food and all other celebrations of good living. We want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy the fine wine, stunning scenery and generous hospitality of Abingdon Vineyards. We want to do all this while taking great care of the beautiful land, community and culture that surrounds us. It takes a village! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Purchasing the winery was far beyond our reach, but help from the former owners and our friends and family made this dream a reality. It will be very financially challenging the first few years, as we need to make big purchases and slowly increase our production to a financially sustainable place. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge to growing grapes here in Virginia is the climate. We can have late frost (which took over 40% of our grapes this year) and lots of summer rain, which can cause rot (which took and additional 15% of our grapes this year, for a total crop loss of 55%) Luckily, there are native grape varieties and hybrids that are well suited to Virginia. We would like to plant more of these varieties to ensure the environmental and financial longevity of Abingdon Vineyards.</p>
<p>The climate also poses challenges to events! We are need of more rain and sun shelters, so we can gather and celebrate outside, no matter the weather. Improving the inside spaces will ensure the community can be warm and cozy, even as the snow falls.</p>

Elizabeth, Loren, Ava Jean and their doggies, Eli and Jackson, are known as the 'Country Gingers.' They grew up in Northern California and have always been very involved with food and wine. They stumbled upon a winery when helping their best friends move from California back to Virginia and fell in love with the beautiful land, delicious wines and gracious community. They have made the cross country trek and are thrilled to be the carrying on the Abingdon Vineyards legacy!
Read more in the newspaper article HERE or on our website HERE!

Next Level Needs
Abingdon Vineyards is in a beautiful location, right on the South Holston River. We have 13 acres of grapes and make a wide variety of quality wines. The property is truly beautiful and deserves to be cared for and shared with the community! 
Purchasing the winery is a long stretch for our family. With a huge mortgage and a full staff, it will be a challenge to navigate the initial growth of the winery, especially during this first winter! We also have a lot of work to do to upgrade the property to make it ideal for all of the events we would like to host for the community: wine dinners, music festivals, crawfish boils, weddings and more. This is where YOU come in! You can help us to improve the property and become part of the Abingdon Vineyards family!
WINERY UPGRADE

Upgrade the kitchen to code for catering events - $10,000
Install outdoor kitchen for events - $10,000
Build creekside deck for stage & more seating - $15,000
Improve furniture and fixtures for the tasting room and event room - $12,000
Commission more locally built picnic tables - $8,000
Rain cover for patio - $10,000

We are also eager to plant more native North American grapes, which are adapted to our climate and are more environmentally responsible. This will ensure a long future for this local treasure!
SUSTAINABILITY
Planting more native North American varieties that withstand frost and summer rains - $50,000 per acre

The Impact
Abingdon Vineyards has the potential to be an ideal community gathering space for live music, art, fine food and all other celebrations of good living. We want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy the fine wine, stunning scenery and generous hospitality of Abingdon Vineyards. We want to do all this while taking great care of the beautiful land, community and culture that surrounds us. It takes a village! 

Challenges
Purchasing the winery was far beyond our reach, but help from the former owners and our friends and family made this dream a reality. It will be very financially challenging the first few years, as we need to make big purchases and slowly increase our production to a financially sustainable place. 
The biggest challenge to growing grapes here in Virginia is the climate. We can have late frost (which took over 40% of our grapes this year) and lots of summer rain, which can cause rot (which took and additional 15% of our grapes this year, for a total crop loss of 55%) Luckily, there are native grape varieties and hybrids that are well suited to Virginia. We would like to plant more of these varieties to ensure the environmental and financial longevity of Abingdon Vineyards.
The climate also poses challenges to events! We are need of more rain and sun shelters, so we can gather and celebrate outside, no matter the weather. Improving the inside spaces will ensure the community can be warm and cozy, even as the snow falls.

How you can help:
​We hope you will enjoy one of our ""perks"" listed to the right and become a part of our Abingdon Vineyards support team! In addition, please:

Share the campaign and spread the word by Facebook, Instagram or email. Tag us @abingdonvineyards

Come visit us at the winery! We are open Wed-Sun from 11-6 for tastings and picnics. Kids, dogs and kayaks welcome!
Join us for a special event at the winery! Here are just a few that are on the books:

Whole Hog Roast (in partnership with JJ's, Adam Bolt & Wolf Hills Brewing) - Sept. 2

Oktoberfest (in partnership with The Tavern and Studio Brew) - Sept. 30

Wine Dinner (in partnership with Joel Jerkins) - Oct. 20

Halloween Party (also Ava's birthday party! With guest chef Chris Noone) - Oct. 28

Harvest Dinner (with guest chef Charles Parker from Heartwood) - Nov. 17

Holiday Wine Dinner (in partnership with Joel Jerkins) - Dec. 15


Host your own event at the winery! Birthday parties, anniversaries, book clubs, church groups, weddings... we would love to help you celebrate!

This is only the start of our aspirations! If you would like to be an investor in our future vineyard blocks or upcoming distillery, please contact Loren@abingdonvineyards.com
We are forever indebted and honored to spend a lifetime here in beautiful Southwest Virginia!
 
What makes us happy... friends and family enjoying Abingdon Vineyards!

We are grateful our little girl gets to grow up in such a wonderful community and setting!

We are honored to be able to preserve some of Virginia's rich history!

We are looking forward to sharing this slice of heaven with you! Thank you for your support!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Gardening Vertically with Varden</h3>
<p>A space-saving, 2-foot by 3-foot wall-mounted gardening system that holds up to 36 plants, with a drip irrigation system for easy watering. Enjoy the benefits of growing your own herbs and nutrient-dense greens at home. Empowering everyone to start gardening even if short on space. The next evolution of gardening is vertical!</p>
<h3>Our Vertical Gardening Story</h3>
<p>For the past eight years, we have been designing living walls for restaurants, hotels, and retailers who want to display beautiful ornamental plants in a unique and artistic way.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we noticed a surge in interest in the Varden Living Walls from <strong>organic farmers</strong>, many in urban areas, who began using our structures to grow leafy greens and herbs on rooftops or small fields. They liked the vertical concept because it saves them precious space and allows them to grow more food,<strong> in soil</strong>,  without more space.</p>
<p>Seeing urban farmers’ innovative use of our product inspired us. With the sustainability and local produce movement, we’ve become convinced that our focus should be on food. Knowing that nutritious, clean, food access and equality are problems in need of solutions now.</p>
<p>We began tweaking the Varden system to be the best <i>Vertical Garden</i> that everyone can use to start growing their own food even if short on space. <strong>We are there! </strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Food Revolution</strong></h3>
<p>So many people live in urban areas with poor <strong>access to fresh local food </strong>grown in <strong>soil.</strong>  Even when produce is available, it's hard to know how it was grown and what was sprayed on it. Access to clean, fresh food is an increasing problem. The world needs to get back to home-gardening again.  <strong>Time</strong> to garden and <strong>space</strong> to garden are huge hurdles for most people. <strong>Living urban</strong> with a small backyard, no yard or maybe even only a small patio or balcony is challenging even for skilled gardeners. To be useful for <strong>everyone</strong>, we needed to create a small but productive size that could be easily shipped, quickly installed and ensure success.  Our <strong>Varden uses soil</strong> for great flavor and nutrient density,<strong> just like ""<i>mother nature""</i> intended!</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Varden Kit</strong> is our 100% Made in the USA solution and the starting point for the home <i>Victory Garden</i> revolution. We have designed all the parts and figured out how to assemble them in an affordable, fun, box kit to get new gardeners going fast. Now we need to spread the word so everyone can start <strong>gardening vertically</strong>. Even though it's designed, patented and in production, we have accessories to complete, need lots of component inventory, need to increase our staff for box kit assembly, outreach efforts and providing consumer access. There is so much more to do in completing our mission of <strong>evolving how people grow and access their food!</strong></p>

<p>Our long-term goal is to see <strong>Vardening</strong> become the norm and for vertical gardeners to add on to their systems, making <strong>bigger Vertical Garden</strong> to feed their families. Nothing beats the nutrition and taste of cooking with fresh cut herbs and greens. We are developing an<strong> indoor kit</strong> that enables gardeners to bring their <strong>Vardening indoors</strong> for year-round harvests. Our design team is working to perfect the indoor kit components, the trim options, the watering system and lighting. We are almost there and need help to make the last push into full-on, <strong>in-home</strong> vertical gardens that feed people year-round. Since Varden is so <strong>scalable,</strong> we see opportunities ahead in the restaurant, grocery and even greenhouse markets too. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598489489/c5zurb3gkclokunsxdko.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<li><p>The worlds <strong>population</strong> is increasingly more urban and it makes sense that local growing is one of the solutions so harvesting can be closer to time of need, at the peak of freshness and<strong> nutrition</strong>.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Over the past 30 years we have designed, patented and launched other products in the living wall category with good success. We know this market and the plant side of it better than just about anyone. The need for the evolution of food is immediate and the<strong> market is fast moving</strong>. We made it all the way to product production and had to decide to either run the business slowly to conserve funds OR, focus entirely on fund-raising through venture capital.</li>
<li>So far we have self-funded to <strong>manage risk</strong> in sustaining our venture. Covid-19 and cash-flow are concerns for us and could continue to be hurdles to growth.</li>
<li>We are committed to our mission and Crowdfunding allows us to get the word out and raise needed funds while continuing to run the business. Now is the time and Varden is the right product for the rapidly evolving and <strong>hungry world</strong> we live in!</li>

We offer great discounts on the Varden Kit so supporters can get growing and feeling great about it, plus we have some cool wearables and gear to roll out as we go along! By supporting us you become an insider with a view into our progress and evolution. 
All funding goes into growing the business, people to make it happen and messaging to get the word out now, so families sheltering at home can start growing their own.

The Impact

We believe in self-sufficiency, sustainability and secure access to food. We understand that our climate is changing and the planet's soil is degraded and being lost.
Now more than ever, the world needs to know where its food comes from, how it’s grown, when it’s picked and what’s been sprayed on it.
The worlds population is increasingly more urban and it makes sense that local growing is one of the solutions so harvesting can be closer to time of need, at the peak of freshness and nutrition. Gardening at home, urban and community gardens and even indoor vertical farming represent food security, access and equity. 
Our mission is to improve the way the world eats by evolving the garden.
The next evolution of gardening is vertical and it allows nutritious food to be grown in small spaces, out-of-the-way places and empowers everyone to grow  more of their own food.
We make elegantly designed, high functioning, American-Made products that will last for many years. Our Varden Kit is just the beginning and it enables everyone to start growing their own food for fun, beauty, nutrition and security.
Join us in our mission to improve the way the world eats, start gardening vertically and help us get the word out. 


Risks & Challenges

Over the past 30 years we have designed, patented and launched other products in the living wall category with good success. We know this market and the plant side of it better than just about anyone. The need for the evolution of food is immediate and the market is fast moving. We made it all the way to product production and had to decide to either run the business slowly to conserve funds OR, focus entirely on fund-raising through venture capital.
So far we have self-funded to manage risk in sustaining our venture. Covid-19 and cash-flow are concerns for us and could continue to be hurdles to growth.
We are committed to our mission and Crowdfunding allows us to get the word out and raise needed funds while continuing to run the business. Now is the time and Varden is the right product for the rapidly evolving and hungry world we live in!

<h3>The genesis of the Pod Pistol</h3>
<p>The concept for the Pod Pistol came to me when I was serving with Army Special Operations and spending a lot of time around guns and drinking a lot of pod coffee. It occurred to me that there were a bunch of similarities between the shape of bullets and coffee pods and that it would be cool to do something with that. Fast forward 5 years to my discharge from the Army and when all was said and done, one of the things I seemed to miss the most about my military time was the tactile experience of operating guns, and I looped back around to the coffee pod gun concept with an emphasis on capturing some of the tactile experience of handling guns. Around the same time I was completing a subject in entrepreneurship to finish up my MBA and I thought I'd go all in and found Coffee Cannon to bring my vision to life! Starting with a very basic concept that I made myself with parts from a hardware store I created the first prototype. Pretty quickly I exceeded my ability for further development and I reached out to an industrial designer to prove the concept with a 3D printed device (pictured below).</p>

<p>Once we had proven that we could make a magazine-fed, bolt-action coffee pod dispenser work, it was off to a larger industrial design firm to further refine the device and prepare it for mass manufacture. After a further couple of years of development the refined Pod Pistol is finally ready to go into production!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are ready to rock with production of the moulds that will allow us to mass produce the Pod Pistol. The funds from success in this campaign will allow us to produce the first run of Pod Pistols and deliver them to the exclusive Alpha Team of buyers. The plan is to keep the first production run small and we anticipate that only 2800 will be available initially. Your bid will not only help us realise our dream of bringing the Pod Pistol to the market, but it will allow you to be one of the first-movers to join the elite Alpha Team of owners by securing one of these devices. </p>

<p>Along the way I have joined forces with my mate, and now business partner, Dusty, who is an active duty Police Officer and between us we have raised the funds to build the plates that will allow mass production of the Pod Pistol. </p>
<div>With your help we can fund the first production run of Pod Pistols and get them out there for coffee and gun lovers to start having fun with! For those of you who want to support the mission but either don't have a K-Cup machine, or simply aren't ready to commit to buying a Pod Pistol, check out our other range of merchandise that will allow you to get involved and be part of the team. </div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our team is looking for your help to bring a community space to life in Stow, Massachusetts.  Our mission is to provide a safe outdoor gathering space with excellent options for food and beverage.  We are looking for your contribution to help us speed up the plans for our outdoor gathering space.  We would like to build this with you, for you.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have a beautiful historic farm building and barn tucked away and ready to offer tasty food and groceries which will open this Fall. We do need help with getting the space fully ready for outdoor experiences and are asking for your sponsorship to help make that happen much faster.</p>
<p>Jordan and Reanna are owners of 29 Rustic in Sudbury, MA.  Their team, along with the entire restaurant industry, has been hit hard.  First, the EEE spread impacted the town of Sudbury, with a town-wide curfew of 6PM.  Shortly after, Covid-19 struck and has made traditional service a massive challenge with constant turns and pivots.  Nan's is our solution to what the community requires—easy access to curbside service, provisions and most importantly, safe outdoor gathering.</p>

<p><strong>We are looking to build this with you and for you.</strong> </p>
<p>It is important for us not only to understand what you would like to see for your gathering space but to help get the basics covered so that we can speed along for you to safely gather.  Our indoor space and inventory is covered—we are looking for your help building out the outdoor space of which we have 2.5 acres.</p>

<h3>The Idea:</h3>
<p>SnackAsian Box was founded due to a love of Asian snacks. From the uniquely awesome flavours featured in Japanese snacks like Japanese KitKats and Coca Cola to the iconic Chinese Lobster Chips and the Korean seaweed crackers, I realized that snacks are one of the best ways to experience a country! But, it often isn't possible to fly halfway across the globe (for many people, like us) to visit places like Shanghai or Tokyo. So I wanted a way to experience these exquisite locations through snacks! I subscribed to many different Asian snack subscription boxes, but there was one issue - there wasn't any choice in what showed up in your box! The ""surprise factor"" was nice, but constantly getting coffee or matcha flavoured snacks which I didn't really enjoy made me feel like I was throwing my money into snacks I didn't want to finish after trying a bite.</p>
<p>That led to SnackAsian Box: the Personalized Asian Snack Box. We personalize your box by asking you to complete surveys that let your curator know your snack preferences. This way, we keep the ""surprise!"" while making sure that the surprise is a good one!</p>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>The 1-month subscription to either one of our boxes will ship you just 1 box so you can get to know what it is like. We will follow up with a survey that will ask you whether or not you liked each snack in your box. If you are interested in subscribing to more boxes, we will be able to use your answers to the survey to curate a box just for you!</p>
<p>The 3-month subscription will ship you 1 box every month for 3 months. The first box will be the same as the 1-month subscription, but boxes after that will vary based on your preferences from the survey! The survey is super simple and will be sent to your email - you just click the ""yes"" or the ""not really"" regarding whether or not you liked the snack for every snack you got. It's optional, too, so feel free to ignore it.</p>
<p>The Standard Box is a good pick if you (or the person you are gifting it to) want a smaller taste of the many different Asian snacks!</p>
<p>The Premium Box is a great pick for someone looking for a larger taste of all the amazing Asian snacks!</p>
<h3>What snacks will I get:</h3>
<p>You'll receive all sorts of Asian snacks - from unique Japanese KitKats to Chinese gummies and Korean chips! We don't want to tell you exactly what's going to be in your snack box, because that would ruin the surprise - but we want you to know what to expect. So check out our sample unboxing video (above) to get an idea of what you might get in your box. The best part is that if you don't like a snack, you can let your curator know! So you're always in control of what you get - even when you don't know exactly what it is!</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already negotiated with companies for the packaging, snacks, and shipping costs. One thing to note would be shipping times and possible damage, as weather and other situations may account for longer shipping times and late arrival. Once we ship a product, we are not responsible for any damage that may happen due to shipping. However, our boxes are quite sturdy and this damage is unlikely.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:-.25pt;"">Originally, our Bliss Nut Butters <a href=""http://blissnutbutters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://blissnutbutters.com</a> were created to help me with my distance training events. I was running triathlons and such and finding that most Peanut Butters were overly processed and just not healthy enough to support my regimen. What I discovered after making my creation in my kitchen is that everyone was just loving this new kind of Nut Butter. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:-.25pt;"">I kept the ingredients simple but the flavor profile had to be something I’d want to eat every day – so I took Peanuts, Sea Salt and Organic Honey, along with Sunflower Oil to create a taste profile that was unique. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:-.25pt;"">Plus, I sort of developed a more “cold-pressed process” for the peanuts by not cooking them or grinding them so fine to keep the integrity of the nutrition I was seeking from the peanuts. The result is Bliss Nut Butters and the response we have been having has been astounding!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:-0.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt;"">Over the last few years, we've become so passionate about how we eat and how we can help others enjoy gourmet delights like nut butters without the usual health risks of unhealthy ingredients. Our nutritionally designed Bliss Nut Butters help everyone find a powerful flavor profile and a great source of nutrients that can help anyone of any age.</p>

<li style=""margin-left:-0.25pt;"">We also want to purchase a Form Fill and Seal machine so we can start selling and giving away small 1 oz. samples and boxes of the sachets as another way to enjoy our brand. These machines cost about $25,000.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:-0.25pt;""><p style=""margin-left:-.25pt;"">We really need a cap chucker for better security of our lids onto our jars.<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Right now we manually seal the lid then use a plastic wrap around the lids edge. It’s time consuming and less attractive than having a cap that is machine sealed and the lid “pops’ when opened to insure freshness. They cost around $15,000</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>With each contribution you'll get a chance to enjoy the wonderful line up of Bliss Nut Butters. As you donate more, you get more - tee shirts, recipes, gift boxes of nut butters and even a chance to try new flavors before we launch them to the general public.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we plan on using what funds have been raised to get certified and then look to which machinery we can purchase right away to make a stronger &amp; smarter production process.</p>

We purchased the building, the equipment, and have started upgrading major systems to bring the building up to code.  We are currently working to finish the production area plumbing, new electrical work, the taproom, and the outdoor beer garden.  We've invested a lot of our own money in this project, secured a large loan from our bank, and one investor.  We have a few projects left before we can open and we are asking for you to show your support and join the Launch Crew to help get Flying Man Brewing off the ground!</p><p> </p><h3 align=""center""><strong>What’s Flying and What’s Still Grounded</strong></h3><p>We purchased our North East Austin location and equipment in August 2016.  Since then we have been working hard to bring the building up to code and remodel the space.

We purchased the building, the equipment, and have started upgrading major systems to bring the building up to code.  We are currently working to finish the production area plumbing, new electrical work, the taproom, and the outdoor beer garden.  We've invested a lot of our own money in this project, secured a large loan from our bank, and one investor.  We have a few projects left before we can open and we are asking for you to show your support and join the Launch Crew to help get Flying Man Brewing off the ground! What’s Flying and What’s Still GroundedWe purchased our North East Austin location and equipment in August 2016.  Since then we have been working hard to bring the building up to code and remodel the space.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I was born in the USA but moved to Sardinia, Italy in 1990 and never looked back. I have two sons in Sardinia, My older son is living in Seattle and working to develop Trigu on the West Coast.</p>
<p>I spent most of my professional career in digital media where I was lucky enough to work with organizations like the Mandela Foundation, the band U2 and IMG. I have always worked where I found a strong passion and connection and that is how at age 50 I came to food, my original source of income as a high school and college student (cook and waiter).</p>
<p>Trigu Italia was born naturally when my son moved to Seattle and was working long days in restaurants. One day I called him and told him that I thought it would be great if he could keep a connection with his homeland and even help friends and fellow Sardinians. At the same time, I was speaking to Sardinian artisan producers, especially, Paolo Melis , the founder of Bresca Dorada, Sardinia's best mirto distillery. It was out of these two conversations and two friendships that quickly developed with the owners of two dairies, Formaggi Aresu and Murtas Formaggi that I understood our mission and vision;</p>
<p>help Sardinian artisans continue what they do best and that is producing some of the healthiest , genuine and culturally intense products on the planet. Bring this food in its most natural state to the USA and help people get back into touch with real flavors and rhythms with product from one of the oldest cultures in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Sardinia has always been the bread basket, since Roman times and even before. Artisans are not always great marketers and this is where Trigu fits in. We want to create a simple and direct business model, where product gets to American cooks, stores and consumers in the fastest and most simple way possible, keeping more margin for the artisans and with the idea of creating work for young Sardinians, like my son, who want to be connected to the island but who also want to travel and explore the world.</p>
<p>If we are successful, we will show not just the 2 dairies we are working with how to tap a huge new market but also all of the other Sardinian artisans who can follow suite, whether they do it with us or simply copy our model.</p>
<p>We are successful when Sardinians say, hey, those Brownsteins, they really helped the Sardinian artisan at a time when it was most needed to protect our culture and our traditions.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>

<li>eventually 1 store or food truck</li>
<li>Initial funds will go to cover full time salaries and the marketing of our holiday season product for consumers.</li>
<li>You get an amazing Taste Sardinia box with over 5 pounds of cheese from Sardinia , delivered to your doorstep or as a gift.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The most important impact we can make is to be successful enough where other people copy us or simply join our project. I strongly believe that Trigu Italia in the long term is a travel company. First we get people intrigued about the incredible island of Sardinia and its products and then we get people to come visit the producers and understand in more detail what healthy, genuine food production is all about.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I get sick. If Gabriele and I do not work well together. If Trump starts to ban European products. If we make silly mistakes with the FDA and food regulations.</p>

<p>I grew up in the city, but my parents grew a vegetable garden in our backyard. They gave me my own little plot where I planted pink and purple flowers, and they let me keep a couple of rabbits too. Since I was a little girl, I have always loved digging in the dirt, helping plants grow, and caring for animals. My Dad saved this picture I that drew when I was about eight; it depicts my childhood vision for my future farm. </p>

<p>Flash forward 30 years ... my boyfriend Chris and I cultivated a mini-farm in our rented duplex. We built a 20x4 foot garden bed and a greenhouse for vegetables and herbs in the backyard. We raised five chickens that lay over two dozen eggs every week (we haven't bought eggs in over a year, plus they make the best organic fertilizer you've ever seen). We have a worm composting system, and we recently added five colonies of honey bees. Our mini-farm is completely sustainable. We designed closed loops for organic matter, with each component feeding the next component in an infinite cycle.</p>

<p>We make our own jam, jelly, pickles, cheese, beer, and lots of other things from scratch -- and we love to share what we make with our friends and family. So many people asked to buy what we produce that we decided to start a business, <i>Valhalla Organics,</i> to sell our farm-to-table goodies to the public. </p>
<p>With the launch of Valhalla Organics, we intend to engage a larger community who support sustainable farming and beekeeping as a means to reinvent our food systems and revolutionize our world. But launching a new business isn't even the most exciting news we have to share... </p>
<p><strong>After searching forever to find the perfect place, we recently purchased five and a half acres of rural land in Southern Oregon. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504113265/oblobbvs742tbnxr4fii.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our land is a secluded evergreen forest, with towering Ponderosa pine trees surrounding perfect natural clearings. It's completely off-grid and there's nothing on the property except an outhouse (miraculously in pristine condition). The land backs up to over two million acres of wilderness, so the bees will have plenty of space to forage. </p>
<p>We don't plan to live there full-time right away, but we do need to make the land ""livable"" so that we can care for the crops and bees during the growing season. </p>
<p>Our dream is coming true -- but it's going to take a lot of work to get everything ready for bees and plants (and people!). That's why we are reaching out to our community for help launching this small farm. </p>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>Of course, there are a million projects and plenty of costs associated with starting a small farm business. <b>Each project isn't terribly expensive on its own, but they all add up to a total estimated infrastructure/start-up cost of $15,850. </b> </p>
<p>We're not asking for help with *all* of the expenses, so we set our fundraising goal much lower than the total cost that we expect to pay to set up the land.</p>
<p>Of course we'll be thrilled if we meet or exceed our goal, but really we are just hoping for a small financial boost as a vote of confidence from our friends to get this farm started. We are grateful for your generosity. <strong>Every contribution -- no matter how large or how small -- helps us make this happen.</strong></p>
<h3>Fall Priorities</h3>
<p>There are four crucial projects that must be completed before the snow starts falling and the ground freezes. During winter, two to six feet of snow cover is typical at our elevation, and it can start snowing as early as October. The dirt road to our land isn't plowed, so it will be inaccessible once snow accumulates, making these projects urgent to complete. <strong>Fall expense total = $6,200. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Driveway: </strong>The driveway needs some work so vehicles can safely make it down (and more importantly, back up again!). The plan is to put a layer of cinder down to smooth it out, and there may be a bit of excavation involved (there are a few large rocks). <strong>Estimated cost: $500</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Water: </strong>There is no water on the property, so we will install two in-ground water tanks (it's important to have two in case one fails). We'll hire a water delivery truck to fill the tanks in the spring. This system will provide all the water we need to drink and bathe, with enough to water the plants (they need a lot more than we do) and to provide water for the bees (they need water to drink and to keep their hives cool!). <strong>Estimated cost: $1800 </strong>($1400 for two tanks; $400 for excavation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Trees: </strong>A few of the trees are hopelessly infested by bark beetles (a.k.a. ""pine beetles"") -- the beetles kill the trees they live in and then move on to the next tree. In order to protect the healthy trees, we need to cut down the sick trees. It's sad - but not as tragic as it would be to lose all of the trees if we let the beetles go unchecked. Luckily Chris is a certified sawyer (trained and certified to safely cut down trees), so the only thing we need is a chainsaw. Unfortunately, pine beetles love to attack the biggest, oldest trees, so it will take a pretty hardcore chainsaw to handle those massive trees. Though the beetles kill the trees they infest, the lumber is still good, so we will use it to build structures on the land. We will plant two beetle-resistant trees for every tree that we have to cut. Right now it looks like about a dozen trees need to go, so we'll plant roughly 25 new trees. Check out the perks if you're interested in sponsoring one of our baby trees! <strong>Estimated cost: $650</strong> ($400 for the chainsaw; $250 for 25 baby trees; plus additional $1000 for 5 larger Douglas Fir trees). </li>
<li>
<strong>Security:</strong> We need to install a proper gate for the entrance/driveway and put fencing along the property lines to make the farm more secure. In order to ensure that we put the fence in exactly the right place, we'll get an official survey of the property lines (it's expensive but necessary). We're also putting up ""No Trespassing,"" ""No Hunting,"" and ""Caution: Bees"" signs to deter unwanted visitors in the meantime.  <strong>Estimated cost: $3250 </strong>($2500 for the fence; $250 for the gate; $500 for the survey). </li>

<h3><strong>Exciting Update! </strong></h3>
<p>Thanks to your generosity, we bought a chainsaw that will allow us safely take down the trees. We named her ""Lt. Ripley"" (yes, after Sigourney Weaver's character in the ""Aliens"" movies), because she's a badass -- and she'll cut you!</p>

<div> </div>
<h3>Spring Priorities</h3>
<p>As soon as the snow melts, we'll start building the infrastructure. These are just a few of the things we'll need to do before we can plant the garden and move the bees to their new home. <b>Spring expense total = $9,650.</b> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Housing:</strong> We plan to purchase a used trailer that we'll live in when we're up at the farm. It will undoubtedly be previously-owned, rustic, and require some work to make it livable. We hope to find a ""fixer-upper"" this fall so that Chris can work on it over the winter. Once we move the trailer to the land, we will build a simple three-walled shelter to protect the trailer (old trailers typically have leaky roofs), and add a simple water catchment system on the shelter roof to collect rain water. <strong>Estimated cost: $2300 </strong>($2000 for the trailer; $300 for the shelter and water catchment system). </li>
<li>
<strong>Power: </strong>We plan to purchase a generator and two solar panels. The generator will provide a back up power source; we may get enough sunshine to power everything we need off of solar alone but we don't want to chance it. <strong>Estimated cost: $850</strong> ($350 for the generator; $500 for the solar panels). </li>
<li>
<strong>Greenhouses:</strong> We will build two large greenhouses, using a hoop house design. They will be made from PVC pipe with rebar/concrete foundation and plastic sheeting for the covers. This is one of the most cost-effective and energy-efficient ways to build greenhouses, with each costing roughly $500. There is a perfect clearing that gets full sun throughout the day and is relatively flat, so we won't have to do heavy excavation to build the greenhouses. <strong>Estimated cost: $1000 for 2 greenhouses.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Apiary:</strong> I plan to purchase more bees and more beehives to expand the apiary in the spring; I'd like to put at least 10 hives on the land and keep 2 hives in town. It costs about $500 to set up each hive (including the bees, the hive boxes, and what I'll need to feed them for the first 2 months). <strong>Estimated cost: $5000 for 10 new bee hives.  </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bear-Proof Solar Electric Fence. </strong>What do bears like best? HONEY! There are black bears living on the land, so we need to take additional precautions to protect the hives that are not needed in town. We plan to surround all of the hives with electric fence -- and because we're off-grid, it will be a solar-powered electric fence. Our worm compost bins will also reside within the perimeter of the electric fence. Added bonus: bees, worms, and valuable compost will be protected from raccoons, skunks, foxes, and other curious/hungry animals. <strong>Estimated cost: $500.</strong>

<h2>Why Does This Matter? </h2>
<p>This isn't just about launching one small farm - your contribution does more than just help us personally. We wanted to share a bit about why we are doing this and what your contribution supports beyond just our little farm.  <strong>You are sustaining the ideals of permaculture, local farming, natural pollination, and organic food production when you support Valhalla Organics.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Big agriculture (""Big Ag"") causes problems for everyone because they use unsustainable methods of mass food production that prioritize only profit. Because of these practices, we end up with plants and animals dominating the food supply that are genetically modified, hybridized, sterilized, or otherwise manipulated to diverge from their natural form. In addition, Big Ag poisons our food and water supplies with indiscriminate applications of pesticides, fertilizers, and dangerous chemicals known to cause harm. These corporations have created sterilized seeds, so farmers can no longer save the best seeds to germinate next season as our ancestors have been doing for millennia. They are now beholden to the company and must buy new seeds from them every year. </p>
<p>Livestock fare even worse than plants in mass production -- for example, chickens have been selectively bred not to naturally copulate and not to sit on their eggs (because it's easier for commercial egg producers if the hens just lay eggs and walk away). So, thanks to Big Ag, there are only a few breeds left of heritage chickens that still know how to have sex and raise babies. It's sick and sad, and that's just one example of Big Ag destroying genetic diversity by removing natural reproduction and natural selection from the life cycle. </p>
<p><strong>The solution is to invest in sustainable farms that utilize permaculture and organic principles.</strong> That is why we grow only organic, heirloom, open-pollinated vegetables and herbs (and flowers!). We don't ever use pesticides (or any product that isn't certified organic) on our garden or with our chickens or anywhere near our bees. The vegetables you'll see at Valhalla Organics were grown sustainably from seed by our loving hands -- those heirloom seeds have been saved and passed down for generations.</p>
<p><strong>The way to reclaim and rebuild our food system is to work in concert with nature instead of trying to manipulate the plants or the bees or the chickens to do our bidding.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504143348/lxwdoshcrjvirrwpitoo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p>Most food-producing plants need to be pollinated in order to produce their delicious fruits, nuts, and veggies! Unfortunately, native pollinators and honey bees are in a desperate situation -- their natural food sources and habitats are disappearing, colony collapse disorder is wreaking havoc, and the ""varroa destructor"" mite spreads diseases that kill colonies at an alarming rate. </p>
<p>Really, it's as simple as this - if there are no pollinators, there will be not be enough food. That's why it's so important to support beekeeping and small organic farms.</p>

<p><strong>Valhalla Organics prioritizes biodiversity and permaculture, applying an ecological approach to small-scale farming and food production. </strong></p>
<p>When you contribute to Valhalla Organics, you are not just helping our little farm -- you're supporting sustainable farming and you're giving a boost to honey bees too. </p>

<h2>Perks!</h2>
<p>We are so grateful for your support, and we created some unique perks to thank you for your generosity!</p>
<div>

<p> </p>
</div>
<p>You can check out the full selection to the right, but here's a couple of highlights.</p>
<h3>Your Legacy on the Land</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eponymous Beehive</strong>: Each of my hives has a name, and if you would like to sponsor one of my new hives... I'll name that hive whatever you'd like. Currently, my hives are named Beyoncè, Lil Kim the Queen Bee, Anya, Hammer &amp; Sickle. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sponsor a Tree:</strong> We will plant two trees for every tree that we have to take down, and we'd like to honor you (or someone you love) by planting a tree. Each baby tree will have a small sign displaying the name of the person who sponsored it (or their chosen honoree's name). We are selecting varieties that grow well at high elevation, are drought-tolerant, and are more resistant to beetle infestation. If you'd like to sponsor multiple trees, we would love that! Indiegogo unfortunately will only let you select one ""tree perk"" but you can just donate the amount per tree and let us know that you want your contribution to sponsor multiple trees. We are keeping a list of everyone who sponsored trees -  we won't let technology stop you from sponsoring as many trees as you want! We have reached our capacity for the small baby seedling trees (and we look forward to honoring their sponsors when the trees go in next spring!). We've just added a new perk where you can sponsor a 5 foot tall Douglas Fir tree - we're planting five of them. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Tasty Perks </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jams, Jellies, Pickles, Relishes</strong>: Everything here is homemade and homegrown, preserved safely and infused with love! Please note that there's a shipping cost of $13 - that covers the cost of mailing you the products in a medium flat rate USPS box. Since I make everything in small batches, the quantities are limited for each item -- when the dill pickles or the cherry preserves are all claimed, they're gone! So grab your favorites before they disappear into another supporter's kitchen. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Honey:</strong> My hives are just babies in the grand scheme of things, so they will need all of the honey they make this year to get through winter, so I won't take any from them. Next year, I will most likely be able to extract honey. If you choose the ""Ruby's Honey"" perk, you'll have to wait until next year but I promise it'll be worth the wait!</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Develop Your Homesteading Skills </h3>
<p>A lot of our friends want to learn how to make things, grow things, and do things yourself -- so we are offering a couple of perks that will allow you to learn homesteading skills, whether or not you aspire to live off the land. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Virtual Homesteading Classes</strong>: Learn how to make cheese or reload shotshells. Check out the perks for more details - these are small group sessions or 1-1 session depending on the topic of the class. Classes will be hosted via online video, so you can join from wherever you are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>""Choose Your Own Adventure"" Homesteading Skills Phone Session:</strong> Since we can't host classes for every type of homesteading skill, but you may be interested in learning more about a specific aspect of what we do here and how to do it yourself, we are offering 30minute phone sessions. You choose the topic, and (depending on the skill you want to learn) one of us can walk you through the basics -- or we can help you troubleshoot if you're having problems with your current system. Topics could include but are not limited to: worm composting, chicken care, organic gardening, cheese making, canning, pickling, hunting, home brewing, reloading, gardening in containers/small spaces, or any of the other skills you've seen us demonstrate. We are excited to share what we've learned and help you get started. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Virtual Beehive Inspection: </strong>Join me for a hive inspection via live video! This is one on one, and I only have five hives to inspect every couple of weeks so the number of spots is limited. You can ask any questions you want and (bonus!) you can laugh at me from the safety of your own home if I get stung while you're watching live. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because Valhalla Organics depends on farm produce and products from the beehives, poor weather or environmental conditions outside our control could have an adverse impact.</p>
<p>However, we currently mitigate these factors by maintaining both an outdoor garden and a greenhouse. We have taken precautions to protect the garden, greenhouse, and the apiary from environmental hazards. Of course, no one can control the weather, but the greenhouses will provide some protection from external conditions. .</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504156031/nkcggazfztj5bflk7x0r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We will have greenhouses and garden beds in town and on the land next summer. I'll continue to maintain my apiary in town with just two hives (most of the bees will be on the land). </p>
<p>Because of our biodiverse system and our ability to farm in two locations, Valhalla Organics will be better protected against uncontrollable environmental factors</p>

</div></div>","I grew up in the city, but my parents grew a vegetable garden in our backyard. They gave me my own little plot where I planted pink and purple flowers, and they let me keep a couple of rabbits too. Since I was a little girl, I have always loved digging in the dirt, helping plants grow, and caring for animals. My Dad saved this picture I that drew when I was about eight; it depicts my childhood vision for my future farm. 

Flash forward 30 years ... my boyfriend Chris and I cultivated a mini-farm in our rented duplex. We built a 20x4 foot garden bed and a greenhouse for vegetables and herbs in the backyard. We raised five chickens that lay over two dozen eggs every week (we haven't bought eggs in over a year, plus they make the best organic fertilizer you've ever seen). We have a worm composting system, and we recently added five colonies of honey bees. Our mini-farm is completely sustainable. We designed closed loops for organic matter, with each component feeding the next component in an infinite cycle.

We make our own jam, jelly, pickles, cheese, beer, and lots of other things from scratch -- and we love to share what we make with our friends and family. So many people asked to buy what we produce that we decided to start a business, Valhalla Organics, to sell our farm-to-table goodies to the public. 
With the launch of Valhalla Organics, we intend to engage a larger community who support sustainable farming and beekeeping as a means to reinvent our food systems and revolutionize our world. But launching a new business isn't even the most exciting news we have to share... 
After searching forever to find the perfect place, we recently purchased five and a half acres of rural land in Southern Oregon. 

Our land is a secluded evergreen forest, with towering Ponderosa pine trees surrounding perfect natural clearings. It's completely off-grid and there's nothing on the property except an outhouse (miraculously in pristine condition). The land backs up to over two million acres of wilderness, so the bees will have plenty of space to forage. 
We don't plan to live there full-time right away, but we do need to make the land ""livable"" so that we can care for the crops and bees during the growing season. 
Our dream is coming true -- but it's going to take a lot of work to get everything ready for bees and plants (and people!). That's why we are reaching out to our community for help launching this small farm.

Exciting Update! 
Thanks to your generosity, we bought a chainsaw that will allow us safely take down the trees. We named her ""Lt. Ripley"" (yes, after Sigourney Weaver's character in the ""Aliens"" movies), because she's a badass -- and she'll cut you!

We don't ever use pesticides (or any product that isn't certified organic) on our garden or with our chickens or anywhere near our bees. The vegetables you'll see at Valhalla Organics were grown sustainably from seed by our loving hands -- those heirloom seeds have been saved and passed down for generations.
The way to reclaim and rebuild our food system is to work in concert with nature instead of trying to manipulate the plants or the bees or the chickens to do our bidding.


Most food-producing plants need to be pollinated in order to produce their delicious fruits, nuts, and veggies! Unfortunately, native pollinators and honey bees are in a desperate situation -- their natural food sources and habitats are disappearing, colony collapse disorder is wreaking havoc, and the ""varroa destructor"" mite spreads diseases that kill colonies at an alarming rate. 
Really, it's as simple as this - if there are no pollinators, there will be not be enough food. That's why it's so important to support beekeeping and small organic farms.

Valhalla Organics prioritizes biodiversity and permaculture, applying an ecological approach to small-scale farming and food production. 
When you contribute to Valhalla Organics, you are not just helping our little farm -- you're supporting sustainable farming and you're giving a boost to honey bees too. 


Perks!
We are so grateful for your support, and we created some unique perks to thank you for your generosity!


 

You can check out the full selection to the right, but here's a couple of highlights.
Your Legacy on the Land

Eponymous Beehive: Each of my hives has a name, and if you would like to sponsor one of my new hives... I'll name that hive whatever you'd like. Currently, my hives are named Beyoncè, Lil Kim the Queen Bee, Anya, Hammer & Sickle. 
Sponsor a Tree: We will plant two trees for every tree that we have to take down, and we'd like to honor you (or someone you love) by planting a tree. Each baby tree will have a small sign displaying the name of the person who sponsored it (or their chosen honoree's name). We are selecting varieties that grow well at high elevation, are drought-tolerant, and are more resistant to beetle infestation. If you'd like to sponsor multiple trees, we would love that! Indiegogo unfortunately will only let you select one ""tree perk"" but you can just donate the amount per tree and let us know that you want your contribution to sponsor multiple trees. We are keeping a list of everyone who sponsored trees -  we won't let technology stop you from sponsoring as many trees as you want! We have reached our capacity for the small baby seedling trees (and we look forward to honoring their sponsors when the trees go in next spring!). We've just added a new perk where you can sponsor a 5 foot tall Douglas Fir tree - we're planting five of them. 

Tasty Perks 

Jams, Jellies, Pickles, Relishes: Everything here is homemade and homegrown, preserved safely and infused with love! Please note that there's a shipping cost of $13 - that covers the cost of mailing you the products in a medium flat rate USPS box. Since I make everything in small batches, the quantities are limited for each item -- when the dill pickles or the cherry preserves are all claimed, they're gone! So grab your favorites before they disappear into another supporter's kitchen. 
Honey: My hives are just babies in the grand scheme of things, so they will need all of the honey they make this year to get through winter, so I won't take any from them. Next year, I will most likely be able to extract honey. If you choose the ""Ruby's Honey"" perk, you'll have to wait until next year but I promise it'll be worth the wait!

Develop Your Homesteading Skills 
A lot of our friends want to learn how to make things, grow things, and do things yourself -- so we are offering a couple of perks that will allow you to learn homesteading skills, whether or not you aspire to live off the land. 

Virtual Homesteading Classes: Learn how to make cheese or reload shotshells. Check out the perks for more details - these are small group sessions or 1-1 session depending on the topic of the class. Classes will be hosted via online video, so you can join from wherever you are.
""Choose Your Own Adventure"" Homesteading Skills Phone Session: Since we can't host classes for every type of homesteading skill, but you may be interested in learning more about a specific aspect of what we do here and how to do it yourself, we are offering 30minute phone sessions. You choose the topic, and (depending on the skill you want to learn) one of us can walk you through the basics -- or we can help you troubleshoot if you're having problems with your current system. Topics could include but are not limited to: worm composting, chicken care, organic gardening, cheese making, canning, pickling, hunting, home brewing, reloading, gardening in containers/small spaces, or any of the other skills you've seen us demonstrate. We are excited to share what we've learned and help you get started. 
Virtual Beehive Inspection: Join me for a hive inspection via live video! This is one on one, and I only have five hives to inspect every couple of weeks so the number of spots is limited. You can ask any questions you want and (bonus!) you can laugh at me from the safety of your own home if I get stung while you're watching live. 


Risks & Challenges
Because Valhalla Organics depends on farm produce and products from the beehives, poor weather or environmental conditions outside our control could have an adverse impact.
However, we currently mitigate these factors by maintaining both an outdoor garden and a greenhouse. We have taken precautions to protect the garden, greenhouse, and the apiary from environmental hazards. Of course, no one can control the weather, but the greenhouses will provide some protection from external conditions. .


We will have greenhouses and garden beds in town and on the land next summer. I'll continue to maintain my apiary in town with just two hives (most of the bees will be on the land). 
Because of our biodiverse system and our ability to farm in two locations, Valhalla Organics will be better protected against uncontrollable environmental factors

Bio
We Best Callibress are proud to inform that we are manufacturer, distributor & retailer of Our new fast-growing brand JBC Premium Jerky. We have been in the seafood business for over a decade and have many years of experience in processing fishes. Salmon was the most popular fish for our customers and also loved by us.  and the reason is obvious: we like healthy food and jerky is our favorite snack hence, we decided to create healthy salmon jerky as a snack because the jerky on the market could be also delicious but it's only smoked some of them ground and preserved a lot of salt, which is not a healthy way of processing.  That's why we came up with the idea of ​​how to make salmon jerky in a healthy way.  We use the dehumidification process and only organic ingredients.  Our unique process maintains the natural color of salmon, locked all benefits in each piece of jerky, and are easy to chew.  just the right delicious snack.

2. OMEGA OILS 6 (3.6 grams)
3. OMEGA OILS 9 (8. grams)
One serving of salmon contains 4 g of total fat (0.9 g saturated fat, 1.5 g monounsaturated fat, 2.1 g polyunsaturated fat).
 
Last but not least
We love the ocean and we believe in giving back. We have decided to help organizations working for the sake of the Ocean. We encourage & support ocean cleaning projects.

With the help of the Rainforest Alliance and Forest Stewardship Council, we have started working directly with two communities in El Peten to extract organic sap from the Zapote tree - a large rainforest tree that grows in this region. We then use this sap or ""chicle"" to make the chewy part of our gum.. The trees are not hurt by this process and are only tapped every 4 years. Because these communities can live off of the sale of this unique sap, they no longer feel the pressure to cut down the rainforest to create farms.We then purchase the sap and ship it in blocks to our small, organic-certified factory in El Segundo, California. There we grind up the blocks, add organic waxes, organic flavors, and organic sweeteners to make the world's ONLY organic sugar free chewing gum. In addition to using only organic ingredients, this product contains a unique blend of three organic sugar free sweeteners: organic Stevia, organic Monkfruit, and organic Erythritol. All three of these sweeteners come from organic, plant-based sources. The combination of these unique ingredients helps to remove bacteria from your teeth and strengthen your tooth enamel.What people are saying about us FAST COMPANY, MARCH 2018: “Wild Gum works with the Rainforest Alliance to preserve the tree sap it uses, and promotes growth and fair trade in local communities, supporting economic growth across Latin America.”How is this different from other gums98% of gum products in the USA are made with a synthetic plastic named Polyisobutylene or “PIB.” PIB is a refined form of petroleum that is manufactured in a 4-stack oil refinery and made into plastic-like pellets.

<p>It's likely that most of you will already know me. If not, let me introduce myself. My name is Ben and I own Lassen Traditional Cider. My drive to get into making cider commercially comes from a long history of fermentation projects and making cider at home and a belief that I could do better than many other commonly available ciders. I've been selling my cider commercially for just over a year. I have a strong commitment to making what I refer to as real cider. To me, this means traditional, dry, heritage-style cider that's a completely different product than what many people think of when they think of cider. My cider making style is a simple, non-interventionist approach- good apples and time- hands off, letting nature take its course. The most important thing to me is the fruit. I don't buy whatever apples I can get, or worse, mass produced juice or concentrate. I seek out varieties that make good cider. My biggest lesson from making cider at home was that some apples make amazing cider, and others, not so much. My focus is on using American heirloom varieties that have a rich tradition in cider making. My mainstays are Newtown Pippin, King David, Winesap, and Arkansas Black. These are not necessarily the super tannic bittersweet or bittersharp apples used in traditional European ciders, but what they lack in tannins, they make up for in aromatics. Indeed, once a bite is taken out of a fully ripe heirloom apple, it can be difficult to go back to eating some of the more common supermarket dessert varieties that dominate store shelves. Most younger people have never heard the names Newtown Pippin and Winesap, but ask an old-timer and they get a gleam in their eye reminiscing about when they would go get some of those fresh off the tree at their local orchard.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510107385/ldt81iophfv64kvv30m3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After I find this high quality fruit, I haul it to my cidery where I press it and put it directly into neutral wine barrels. They were used for wine for a period of 3-5 years and most of the tannins in the oak have been leached out by the wine. The cider, unsulfited is wild fermented to complete dryness in the barrels for up to three months. The native yeast on the fruit, brought in from the orchard, combined with whatever resident yeasts are in the air or on the cider equipment are allowed to perform the fermentation. Primary fermentation is mostly complete within a month then it's allowed to sit on the lees for a couple more months, picking up additional barrel flavor and starting the aging process. The cider is then racked out of the barrels, blended, mixed with a small amount of fresh apple juice and bottled. The fresh juice gives the yeast one last kick, where their activity picks back up again in the bottle just enough to start a secondary fermentation for natural carbonation, or bottle conditioning, similar to the methode champenoise. The cider is neither filtered or pasteurized. Being a live product, it tends to continue evolving throughout the year, and will mature just fine for years.</p>
<p>High end craft cider is still a new experience for many people. When most folks take a sip of my cider they typically comment how different it is from most ciders they've had. The sad thing is that a lot of cheap 6 pack ciders taste more like apple juice than cider. These ""cider coolers"" are not what I'd call cider. Does wine taste like grape juice? Of course not! The fact is, high quality cider has the potential to expand into a huge market. Many people are starting to make high end cider, and in 3-5 years there will be many options for this level of artisanal cider. The word ""craft"" gets thrown around a lot these days by cideries and breweries. But what I'm talking about is true craft. People are planting cider and heirloom apple varieties and the world of cider will change greatly in the near future.</p>
<p>I've been selling my cider all over Northern California, filling up my car with cases and personally delivering them. While many people have yet to figure out what real cider is, I have found a reasonable amount of success and notoriety. I've received awards in the Great Lakes International Cider Competition and the California Cider Competition, and my Newtown Pippin cider was recently named a Good Food award finalist, a competition with a rigorous vetting process for producers making high quality products using responsible methods.</p>
<p>In summary, I'd like to be able to position my company to be able to grow and establish itself as a regional brand. As of now, I'm still small enough that I can still self distribute, but I'd like to grow my production enough where I can justify going through a distributor and selling outside of the state of California. To be able to increase production, I need a bigger press. The press I have now is rather small. My production this year will be a little over 2000 gallons and it took a lot of work to get there. The amount I'd need for a larger pressing system will run around $40,000. I'm doing this campaign to raise money for part of that expense. I will be taking out a loan for the remainder. If you can help out, you'll be rewarded greatly. The perks are all useful, stylish, and functional. For those of you who've never tried my cider, consider buying some as a perk. Help make Lassen Traditional Cider a success! Together we can put cider on a track to where the wine industry is!</p>
<p>Please help spread the word and forward on to other people who might be interested! Thanks for reading and I'm sincerely grateful if you decide to contribute.</p>
</div><div> </div><div> </div><p> </p></div>","It's likely that most of you will already know me. If not, let me introduce myself. My name is Ben and I own Lassen Traditional Cider. My drive to get into making cider commercially comes from a long history of fermentation projects and making cider at home and a belief that I could do better than many other commonly available ciders. I've been selling my cider commercially for just over a year. I have a strong commitment to making what I refer to as real cider. To me, this means traditional, dry, heritage-style cider that's a completely different product than what many people think of when they think of cider. My cider making style is a simple, non-interventionist approach- good apples and time- hands off, letting nature take its course. The most important thing to me is the fruit. I don't buy whatever apples I can get, or worse, mass produced juice or concentrate. I seek out varieties that make good cider. My biggest lesson from making cider at home was that some apples make amazing cider, and others, not so much. My focus is on using American heirloom varieties that have a rich tradition in cider making. My mainstays are Newtown Pippin, King David, Winesap, and Arkansas Black. These are not necessarily the super tannic bittersweet or bittersharp apples used in traditional European ciders, but what they lack in tannins, they make up for in aromatics. Indeed, once a bite is taken out of a fully ripe heirloom apple, it can be difficult to go back to eating some of the more common supermarket dessert varieties that dominate store shelves. Most younger people have never heard the names Newtown Pippin and Winesap, but ask an old-timer and they get a gleam in their eye reminiscing about when they would go get some of those fresh off the tree at their local orchard.

After I find this high quality fruit, I haul it to my cidery where I press it and put it directly into neutral wine barrels. They were used for wine for a period of 3-5 years and most of the tannins in the oak have been leached out by the wine. The cider, unsulfited is wild fermented to complete dryness in the barrels for up to three months. The native yeast on the fruit, brought in from the orchard, combined with whatever resident yeasts are in the air or on the cider equipment are allowed to perform the fermentation. Primary fermentation is mostly complete within a month then it's allowed to sit on the lees for a couple more months, picking up additional barrel flavor and starting the aging process. The cider is then racked out of the barrels, blended, mixed with a small amount of fresh apple juice and bottled. The fresh juice gives the yeast one last kick, where their activity picks back up again in the bottle just enough to start a secondary fermentation for natural carbonation, or bottle conditioning, similar to the methode champenoise. The cider is neither filtered or pasteurized. Being a live product, it tends to continue evolving throughout the year, and will mature just fine for years.
High end craft cider is still a new experience for many people. When most folks take a sip of my cider they typically comment how different it is from most ciders they've had. The sad thing is that a lot of cheap 6 pack ciders taste more like apple juice than cider. These ""cider coolers"" are not what I'd call cider. Does wine taste like grape juice? Of course not! The fact is, high quality cider has the potential to expand into a huge market. Many people are starting to make high end cider, and in 3-5 years there will be many options for this level of artisanal cider. The word ""craft"" gets thrown around a lot these days by cideries and breweries. But what I'm talking about is true craft. People are planting cider and heirloom apple varieties and the world of cider will change greatly in the near future.
I've been selling my cider all over Northern California, filling up my car with cases and personally delivering them. While many people have yet to figure out what real cider is, I have found a reasonable amount of success and notoriety. I've received awards in the Great Lakes International Cider Competition and the California Cider Competition, and my Newtown Pippin cider was recently named a Good Food award finalist, a competition with a rigorous vetting process for producers making high quality products using responsible methods.
In summary, I'd like to be able to position my company to be able to grow and establish itself as a regional brand. As of now, I'm still small enough that I can still self distribute, but I'd like to grow my production enough where I can justify going through a distributor and selling outside of the state of California. To be able to increase production, I need a bigger press. The press I have now is rather small. My production this year will be a little over 2000 gallons and it took a lot of work to get there. The amount I'd need for a larger pressing system will run around $40,000. I'm doing this campaign to raise money for part of that expense. I will be taking out a loan for the remainder.

<p><strong>CROCK &amp; ROLL MISSION</strong><br/>Rockin’ recipes slowed cooked and served to a rock-n-roll beat rollin’ through the streets of Las Vegas and beyond.<br/><strong>CROCK &amp; ROLL VISION</strong><br/>Excelling in the food service industry, continually innovating, succeeding through determination and passion.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From the heart and soul of the founder:<br/>Owning my own business has been my lifelong pursuit. My life experience has shown me that I love to cook, I love to bake, and I love to make people happy. I have often heard, “You have missed your calling,” when cooking or baking for an event, party or gathering, but to me, my “calling” just hadn’t started yet. My entrepreneurial heart craved freedom. The freedom to decide the who, the what, the when and the how. The freedom to create great food, play good music, make people laugh and provide a memorable experience. The freedom to achieve my lifelong vision. Over the years, ideas, concepts and plans came and went. In retrospect, it seemed as though the food truck “concept” kept rollin’ past me until it finally clicked for me…this would be a startup business that I could achieve and it was everything I loved to do. The research and planning began and showed that the food truck was an attainable and affordable way to kick start my future with an incredible amount of potential. Determining my niche in this industry took me through several iterations until I finally realized that the crock pot as a means of providing good, home-cooked meals for my growing and busy family was the answer. Seeing other moms at my kid’s soccer practice just as busy as I was, watching hordes of people lined up at the drive thru for a quick lunch or on their way home two hours after dinner time, and eavesdropping on conversations with friends and coworkers as they discuss their stress-filled lives. I could be a solution by providing really good food quick. The mobile food trailer with crock pot cooked entrees emerged as my “calling.”<br/>Crock &amp; Roll will serve hot sandwiches slow-cooked in a crock pot overnight and a different, made-from scratch cheesecake every day. The Crock &amp; Roll food trailer will be “rockin” with rock-n-roll music and customers will order their sandwich favorite by name…literally. Our sandwiches will be named after ultra-famous rock-n-roll musicians…Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendricks and Led Zeppelin, to name a few. With determination and a never-ending passion for good food and making mealtime fun, Crock &amp; Roll WILL become a mainstay in Las Vegas…because “fast” food shouldn’t be boring.</p>
<p>With your help I will be able to complete the Crock &amp; Roll trailer and create a legacy to live on through my children and grandchildren!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I love crock &amp; roll<br/>So put another dime in this jukebox, baby<br/>I love crock n' roll<br/>So come an' take your time an' dance with me</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $5,749 to partially cover the equipment(crock pots, refrigerator, oven/stove) we need to complete the mobile food trailer. We have purchased the 8.5' X 18' trailer equipped with a 100 amp panel with plugs, lighting and air conditioning, plumbing with 3 compartment sinks and handwashing sink, concession window with windows and screens and lastly the hood vent with a grease trap!</p>
<p>We have great gifts for all donors, large and small. We have our love and gratitude, the first ever Crock &amp; Roll t-shirts, Crock &amp; Roll entree's, Crock &amp; Roll cheesecakes, special invites to a VIP party so you can put your dime in the jukebox and dance with me and of course signing your name on the Crock &amp; Roll Wall of Fame because we could not have finished without you!!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will put everything into the equipment and put the rest on credit cards!!! We have already put in over $20,000 so its happening either way!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Crock &amp; Roll greets each customer “where they are.” As a mobile operation, Crock &amp; Roll eliminates the inconvenience of travel for our customers by coming to them and provides a fast and easy way to eat allowing for a more relaxing lunch or dinner break. We are the solution for boring fast food lunches, hungry kids at the end of a busy day, or a drab, stale bag of popcorn at the soccer park.</p>
<p>After the first three years of operation, we plan to operationalize a second mobile food venture called “Lean With It” that serves an extreme health-conscious menu geared toward Generation Z, which will be introduced to the market during certain events like EDC, Burning Man and Life Is Beautiful through the Crock &amp; Roll venue. Five year growth goals include multiple Crock &amp; Roll food trucks in Nevada and the surrounding states.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>STRENGTHS</strong><br/>Industry:  One of the fastest growing industries today, no dominant companies nationwide, low start-up cost to enter industry</p>
<p>Market:  Medium sized market with huge potential for growth with the population of Las Vegas metro estimated at over 2M, year-round sales, ability to service city/county parks without additional permitting or licensure</p>
<p>Organizational:  Well-researched target market, understand core customer base, hyper-focused customer service, will and determination to win in a competitive environment, slow-cooked goodness, served fast!</p>
<p><b>WEAKNESSES</b>                                                                                                                                            Industry:  Requirements to move, low start-up cost for competitors to enter industry</p>
<p>Market:  Summer heat</p>
<p>Organizational:  Unknown name/brand, lack of cash reserve during start-up period</p>
<p><b>OPPORTUNITIES</b>                                                                                                                                         Industry:  Fast growing industry                                                                                                             </p>
<p>Market:  Diverse demographic/socio-economic population</p>
<p>Organizational:  Flexible working hours                                               </p>
<p><b>THREATS</b>                                                                                                                                                      Industry:  Tightening governmental regulation</p>
<p>Market:  Increasing competition</p>
<p>Organizational:  Financial insecurity, nonguaranteed income</p>
<p><strong>There is no restaurant, mobile or otherwise, serving the majority of its menu from a crock pot. </strong>That means for the Crock &amp; Roll customer, a brand new food option is available to them that is healthier in preparation than most fast food and chain restaurants (without being completely vegetarian and/or vegan) and provides convenience and value for their dining out dollar. Crock &amp; Roll can compete in this market with its unique product and exceptional service, its pricing model, and its ability to serve our customer without sacrificing profit margin.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to ""put another dime in our jukebox baby"" you can still make some music. By simply using the Indiegogo share tools and passing this campaign on to your friends and family you are helping considerably. Thanks!! </p>

I have often heard, “You have missed your calling,” when cooking or baking for an event, party or gathering, but to me, my “calling” just hadn’t started yet. My entrepreneurial heart craved freedom. The freedom to decide the who, the what, the when and the how. The freedom to create great food, play good music, make people laugh and provide a memorable experience. The freedom to achieve my lifelong vision. Over the years, ideas, concepts and plans came and went. In retrospect, it seemed as though the food truck “concept” kept rollin’ past me until it finally clicked for me…this would be a startup business that I could achieve and it was everything I loved to do. The research and planning began and showed that the food truck was an attainable and affordable way to kick start my future with an incredible amount of potential. Determining my niche in this industry took me through several iterations until I finally realized that the crock pot as a means of providing good, home-cooked meals for my growing and busy family was the answer. Seeing other moms at my kid’s soccer practice just as busy as I was, watching hordes of people lined up at the drive thru for a quick lunch or on their way home two hours after dinner time, and eavesdropping on conversations with friends and coworkers as they discuss their stress-filled lives. I could be a solution by providing really good food quick. The mobile food trailer with crock pot cooked entrees emerged as my “calling.”Crock & Roll will serve hot sandwiches slow-cooked in a crock pot overnight and a different, made-from scratch cheesecake every day. The Crock & Roll food trailer will be “rockin” with rock-n-roll music and customers will order their sandwich favorite by name…literally. Our sandwiches will be named after ultra-famous rock-n-roll musicians…Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendricks and Led Zeppelin, to name a few. With determination and a never-ending passion for good food and making mealtime fun, Crock & Roll WILL become a mainstay in Las Vegas…because “fast” food shouldn’t be boring.
With your help I will be able to complete the Crock & Roll trailer and create a legacy to live on through my children and grandchildren!

What We Need & What You Get
I love crock & rollSo put another dime in this jukebox, babyI love crock n' rollSo come an' take your time an' dance with me
We are looking to raise $5,749 to partially cover the equipment(crock pots, refrigerator, oven/stove) we need to complete the mobile food trailer. We have purchased the 8.5' X 18' trailer equipped with a 100 amp panel with plugs, lighting and air conditioning, plumbing with 3 compartment sinks and handwashing sink, concession window with windows and screens and lastly the hood vent with a grease trap!
We have great gifts for all donors, large and small. We have our love and gratitude, the first ever Crock & Roll t-shirts, Crock & Roll entree's, Crock & Roll cheesecakes, special invites to a VIP party so you can put your dime in the jukebox and dance with me and of course signing your name on the Crock & Roll Wall of Fame because we could not have finished without you!!
If we don't reach our goal we will put everything into the equipment and put the rest on credit cards!!! We have already put in over $20,000 so its happening either way!!!

The Impact
Crock & Roll greets each customer “where they are.” As a mobile operation, Crock & Roll eliminates the inconvenience of travel for our customers by coming to them and provides a fast and easy way to eat allowing for a more relaxing lunch or dinner break. We are the solution for boring fast food lunches, hungry kids at the end of a busy day, or a drab, stale bag of popcorn at the soccer park.
After the first three years of operation, we plan to operationalize a second mobile food venture called “Lean With It” that serves an extreme health-conscious menu geared toward Generation Z, which will be introduced to the market during certain events like EDC, Burning Man and Life Is Beautiful through the Crock & Roll venue. Five year growth goals include multiple Crock & Roll food trucks in Nevada and the surrounding states.

Risks & Challenges
STRENGTHSIndustry:  One of the fastest growing industries today, no dominant companies nationwide, low start-up cost to enter industry
Market:  Medium sized market with huge potential for growth with the population of Las Vegas metro estimated at over 2M, year-round sales, ability to service city/county parks without additional permitting or licensure
Organizational:  Well-researched target market, understand core customer base, hyper-focused customer service, will and determination to win in a competitive environment, slow-cooked goodness, served fast!
WEAKNESSES                                                                                                                                            Industry:  Requirements to move, low start-up cost for competitors to enter industry
Market:  Summer heat
Organizational:  Unknown name/brand, lack of cash reserve during start-up period
OPPORTUNITIES                                                                                                                                         Industry:  Fast growing industry                                                                                                             
Market:  Diverse demographic/socio-economic population
Organizational:  Flexible working hours                                               
THREATS                                                                                                                                                      Industry:  Tightening governmental regulation
Market:  Increasing competition
Organizational:  Financial insecurity, nonguaranteed income
There is no restaurant, mobile or otherwise, serving the majority of its menu from a crock pot. That means for the Crock & Roll customer, a brand new food option is available to them that is healthier in preparation than most fast food and chain restaurants (without being completely vegetarian and/or vegan) and provides convenience and value for their dining out dollar. Crock & Roll can compete in this market with its unique product and exceptional service, its pricing model, and its ability to serve our customer without sacrificing profit margin.

RBar Protein Bars deliver 10g of protein or more in each of the five new flavors, including Matcha Orange, Pomegranate, Coconut, Acai, and Honey Nut.</p><p>They are full of concentrated ALMOND PROTEIN, giving them a smooth, creamy texture that avoids the off-putting sticky or chalky consistency of other protein bars. RBar Protein Bars are the perfect choice for a protein-packed breakfast, post-workout recovery, any time snacks or meal replacements. All five flavors are plant-based, paleo, non-GMO, and gluten-free with no dairy, whey, hemp, egg, or soy protein.</p><p>We believe in helping you achieve more with less. That's why all of our products have seven all-natural ingredients or less and contain only the highest grade ingredients, natural fruits, and no artificial additives. Unlike most protein bars on the market today, RBar Protein Bars focus on simplicity to ensure the best tasting product from the fewest ingredients possible.</p><h3>How We Got Here</h3><p>Ten years ago, I had a problem with the available energy goo’s, bars, and other commercially available options for sustainable energy during my cycling training and races. So I decided to create my own energy bar made of only the best ingredients that live up to my belief that simple is better.</p><p>I started in my kitchen handcrafting energy bars with just a food processor and a handful of items from my grocery store produce section—nuts, fruits, superfoods— and lots of muscle.</p><p>They caught on right away with my cycling buddies, endurance athletes, and people looking for a simple snack to keep them going. The audience and love for RBar Energy have grown over the years as parents, students, and working adults quickly adopted this alternative healthy snack to help them feed their pursuits.<br/> </p><p>""These are my favorite snack bars! So much better than Larabars and RxBars in my opinion. Not too chewy or mushy. I love all the flavors and the fact that they are made from just a few simple ingredients."" - Kara W.</p><p> </p><h3>We Need Your Support</h3><p>We know the new <a href=""https://rbarenergy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RBar Protein Bars</a> will be a big hit with all of you who already love RBar and have supported us for the last ten years.

RBar Protein Bars deliver 10g of protein or more in each of the five new flavors, including Matcha Orange, Pomegranate, Coconut, Acai, and Honey Nut.They are full of concentrated ALMOND PROTEIN, giving them a smooth, creamy texture that avoids the off-putting sticky or chalky consistency of other protein bars. RBar Protein Bars are the perfect choice for a protein-packed breakfast, post-workout recovery, any time snacks or meal replacements. All five flavors are plant-based, paleo, non-GMO, and gluten-free with no dairy, whey, hemp, egg, or soy protein.We believe in helping you achieve more with less. That's why all of our products have seven all-natural ingredients or less and contain only the highest grade ingredients, natural fruits, and no artificial additives. Unlike most protein bars on the market today, RBar Protein Bars focus on simplicity to ensure the best tasting product from the fewest ingredients possible.How We Got HereTen years ago, I had a problem with the available energy goo’s, bars, and other commercially available options for sustainable energy during my cycling training and races. So I decided to create my own energy bar made of only the best ingredients that live up to my belief that simple is better.I started in my kitchen handcrafting energy bars with just a food processor and a handful of items from my grocery store produce section—nuts, fruits, superfoods— and lots of muscle.They caught on right away with my cycling buddies, endurance athletes, and people looking for a simple snack to keep them going. The audience and love for RBar Energy have grown over the years as parents, students, and working adults quickly adopted this alternative healthy snack to help them feed their pursuits. ""These are my favorite snack bars! So much better than Larabars and RxBars in my opinion. Not too chewy or mushy. I love all the flavors and the fact that they are made from just a few simple ingredients."" - Kara W. We Need Your SupportWe know the new RBar Protein Bars will be a big hit with all of you who already love RBar and have supported us for the last ten years. THANK YOU! Now we need your help to bring RBar Protein Bars to the world. We have moved out of the kitchen and now manufacture our products at a state of the art facility. But manufacturing requires a substantial investment, and we need your help to create the large scale production runs needed to bring RBar Protein Bars to everyone. By becoming a backer at any level, you get us closer to that goal. In return for your support, you will receive the largest discounts we can manage, and most of these offers will only be available this one time. To the oh so many who already love RBar Energy Bars, thank you!  We know you will love our protein bars.

I remembered  the taste of that uncommonly sweet and crisp pineapple from childhood and wanted to revisit it. As soon as we bit into the fruit there was a burst of wonderful flavor that immediately inspired this royal hot sauce. Once the sauce was created, adding in hot sun ripened scotch bonnet peppers, notes of ginger, onion, garlic, raw cane sugar, allspice and other wonderful ingredients we knew we had a rare gem on our hands.</p><p><i>“...yet a memory cannot be trusted, for so much of the experience of the past is determined by the experience of the present.”</i></p><p>― Jamaica Kincaid</p><h3><strong>The Antigua Black Pineapple first harvested by the Arawaks is said to be ‘the world’s sweetest,’ pineapple with a unique flavor. It belongs to the “Queen” group of pineapples, growing primarily on the southwest coast of Antigua- a tropical gem in the Caribbean.

It started with one pepper seed of an idea – what if there was  a hot sauce that wasn’t just about heat for the sake of it, but about delicious Caribbean flavor and the perfect island kick?  A hot sauce that pepper heads and the average home cooks could use on everything without choosing between heat and flavor. That was the start of Bacchanal Sauce crafting fiery condiments with exotic tropical ingredients. The company has now expanded to include a unique fast-casual Caribbean restaurant concept along with one of a kind pop up food experiences.</p><p>Following the pepper and her Caribbean spiked palate Chef Sonya Samuel started Bacchanal Sauce to highlight the taste, excitement, and revelry of a hot Caribbean fête in the form of tropical island condiments &amp; unique Caribbean food experiences! Sonya’s goal is always to share the buoyant richness of Caribbean culture both in the islands and in her Brooklyn &amp; New York community where Caribbean sights and sounds have become wonderfully woven into the New York cultural fabric.</p><p><i>“…she believes in food: that good food should create memories and moments. It should “transport” you.  And, you know what, I’ll give it to her.

 An island vacation in a bottle!This brand new hot pepper sauce from Bacchanal  Sauce is uniquely crafted for connoisseurs of wonderful food secrets and exceptional flavor. A fiery island treasure for home cooks and those who just like to revel in  heat and flavor. Let Black Crown Hot Sauce inspire your every dish because we know you deserve the very best. Island Tings!Hi guys my name is Sonya and I’m the owner at Bacchanal Sauce. A Brooklyn based company that focuses on distinctive Caribbean flavor with a kick! Our brand new hot sauce , the Black Crown Hot Sauce was born on a  recent trip back to Antigua and Barbuda where a visit to the Cades Bay Agriculture center uncovered the flavor & beauty of the Antigua Black Pineapple. I remembered  the taste of that uncommonly sweet and crisp pineapple from childhood and wanted to revisit it. As soon as we bit into the fruit there was a burst of wonderful flavor that immediately inspired this royal hot sauce. Once the sauce was created, adding in hot sun ripened scotch bonnet peppers, notes of ginger, onion, garlic, raw cane sugar, allspice and other wonderful ingredients we knew we had a rare gem on our hands.“...yet a memory cannot be trusted, for so much of the experience of the past is determined by the experience of the present.”― Jamaica KincaidThe Antigua Black Pineapple first harvested by the Arawaks is said to be ‘the world’s sweetest,’ pineapple with a unique flavor. It belongs to the “Queen” group of pineapples, growing primarily on the southwest coast of Antigua- a tropical gem in the Caribbean. This uniquely regal fruit with it’s luscious sweet pulp makes this hot sauce explode with rich fiery flavor.  Above: Local farmer & Antigua Black Pineapple advocate(Local Antigua Black Pineapple & Mango Farmer- he moved to Antigua over 30 years ago and the Antigua Black Pineapple captured his imagination, he now calls Antigua home and is one of the three main farmers who champion the crop)
                                                            

 
Our philosophy of using fresh ethically sourced ingredients to create complex exotic tropical flavor rings true whether in Brooklyn or the shores of the Caribbean. Each bottle is handcrafted and made in small batches to ensure the most intense flavors are captured and preserved.Get Sauced! Perfect to season your pot or add to each meal for Hot island flavor. Imagine breakfast eggs, soups, tacos, tofu scrambles, saltfish cakes, grilled vegetables & seafood all taken to higher heights with a new depth of deep spicy flavor.AboutBacchanal Sauce is the brainchild of a Brooklyn girl with Caribbean roots. It started with one pepper seed of an idea – what if there was  a hot sauce that wasn’t just about heat for the sake of it, but about delicious Caribbean flavor and the perfect island kick?  A hot sauce that pepper heads and the average home cooks could use on everything without choosing between heat and flavor. That was the start of Bacchanal Sauce crafting fiery condiments with exotic tropical ingredients. The company has now expanded to include a unique fast-casual Caribbean restaurant concept along with one of a kind pop up food experiences.Following the pepper and her Caribbean spiked palate Chef Sonya Samuel started Bacchanal Sauce to highlight the taste, excitement, and revelry of a hot Caribbean fête in the form of tropical island condiments & unique Caribbean food experiences! Sonya’s goal is always to share the buoyant richness of Caribbean culture both in the islands and in her Brooklyn & New York community where Caribbean sights and sounds have become wonderfully woven into the New York cultural fabric.“…she believes in food: that good food should create memories and moments. It should “transport” you.  And, you know what, I’ll give it to her.

   Know How Much You HaveThe new Plaato Keg knows exactly how much beer is left in all of your kegs. Highly accurate load-cells keeps track of the good stuff, and yes the beer’s gravity is included in the calculations.   See How Much You PourPlaato Keg shows you pouring in real-time, and notifies you whenever a beer is being poured from your keg.   Get Notified If Your Thermostat Goes WildWith the built-in temperature sensor and WiFi-connection, you can remotely monitor your kegerator. By enabling push-notifications, you will get notified is something is wrong, eg. an opened door or a thermostat running wild.   Share Access To Your InventoryKeep your friends included and grant them access to your account, so they can remind you to run another batch when you’re running low.
 
Reviews
    
Unlocked ALL PLAATO KEG DEVICES Will Get A Built-in Leak-detection Feature. Get notification in the app if liquid is detected. Plaato Keg is internet-connected, so you will get the notification wherever you are.   
Once you start kegging, there’s no way back. We know the drill. Starting out happy with a single keg, then suddenly finding yourself with seven kegs. That is why we designed Plaato Keg to be easy to install.
1. Transfer beer
2. Connect device
3. Ready to tap
 
 
   
PLAATO Keg uses three synchronized, high-quality load-cells that measures the keg-weight every 0.1 second, sending real-time data of your kegs directly to your smartphone using WiFi.  Product Anatomy

Impact resistant polycarbonate body
Withstand even the roughest environments

  Technology ComparisonsThere are two leading technologies used to monitor beer kegs; Load Cells and Flow-meters. As beer brewers, we found this to be an easy choice.  
Don’t get fooled by the sleek design. The PLAATO Keg is small, but it’s ready for big kegs full of beer. High performance materials combined with thought through solutions makes it durable, waterproof and ready to handle kegs up to 13 US gallons / 50L. Fits 99% of all kegs    Waterproofed     100% NON-Invasive - No cleaning - No maintenance   Easy setup  Batch-specific details, real-time measurements and kegerator dashboard.  The free PLAATO-app lets you have all your kegs in the same place. Each keg has its own dashboard, letting you type in batch-specific data, including:
Last Pour Size
Batch name
Kegging date
OG & FG
The built-in calculator automatically calculates the ABV%
Real-Time Tap Status
The app automatically calculates the volume of beer in the keg based on the Final Gravity, and you can choose between Metric or US Customary units. Connect all your kegsAdd unlimited number of kegs in the same account.     Industry-standard accuracy High-quality, full-bridge load-cells makes the PLAATO Keg highly accurate, even on the smallest pours (and on the bigger ones).  Check out the feedback from our beta-users.   
Technical specifications, Materials & PerformancePLAATO® KEG is developed with feedback from over 350 ambassadors enrolled in the PLAATO Test User Program. This ensures a device that fits 99% of the most used kegs out there, including:
All types of Corny Kegs
Key-Kegs
Torpedo Kegs
Sankey Kegs

 
   
Enable CO2-mode & monitor the CO2-bottleIt came to us while in development. If we can measure the real-time level of beer, then we can do the same thing with CO2! Presenting you the CO2-version of the PLAATO Keg. Enable CO2-mode in the Plaato-app, and turn one of your keg-devices into your CO2-bottle monitor, checking the remaining level of gas in real-time. Use it to have control over the remaining level of CO2 to make sure you have enough for the upcoming brew-day, or use it to detect a CO2-leak from a connector. CO2-bottles loses mass as the CO2 is used by carbonation, tapping or leaks. This means that by placing the CO2- bottle on top of our ""PLAATO Keg"", you will get precise estimates of the remaining level of CO2. This feature can also be used to detect leaks.Most CO2-bottles fit directly onto the Plaato Keg, providing you the tool to never be unawarely out of CO2 again  
EARLY BIRD REWARDS  Comparing the vitals of the PLAATO Keg with the other solutions out there, and it'll make a clear picture   
We believe in an open community where hardware and software are unified. That is why we already now has started working on the API that lets you connect your PLAATO Keg to best brewing software out there: Brewfather. 
We have tried, tested and redesigned the PLAATO Keg more times than we want to admit. Our end goal has always been to make a product that we can all stand behind.
 
  Located in Oslo, Norway, we do all development and design from our lab.

<h3>Tessie's Teas = Healthy Living</h3>
<p>First, I have been in the community service arena for 20+ years. I have provided mental health counseling to individuals suffering from schizophrenia to bipolar disorder, and everything in between. I worked in the education arena for the majority of those years in various capacities, providing services to children and families. The students I have worked with were lost and in need of love and direction (pregnant teens, abused mentally and physically and varying exceptionalities students, youth on the road to committing serious crimes, and others unable to negotiate the educational system successfully. I have counseled, washed faces, combed hair, provide meals, assist with housing, wrote grants successfully to provide car seats, assist with scholarships, provided college tours, gotten major hospitals to support a campus clinic so the students and their children wouldn't miss valuable teachable hours. I have been an expert witness for children caught up in sex slavery scenarios, abandonment, and vicious life situations that most people couldn't even imagine. For the majority of my professional career, I have worked with children suffering in unspeakable ways.</p>
<p>One day, I just felt burnout and overwhelmed and needed to follow my dream of providing a different type of service. Now, I have poured my heart, soul, and resources into my love for tea. I was born in Jamaica WID, and as a child, my great grandmother always talked about the medicinal benefits derived from drinking various herbs, spices, and roots. Drinking tea is a family tradition spanning over five generations. We're shaking up the traditional tea space by providing beneficial instant teas, no messy tea bags or steep time needed. Just pour crystal in a cup, pour in water, stir and go. </p>
<p> Our teas are all natural, instant crystalized ginger-honey and mint teas having no additives, no preservative, and no caffeine. They are convenient and portable for the busy but health-conscious consumer.  The vacuum sealed satchel makes 2 cups of tea, just by adding 8-10oz of water and can be consumed hot or cold. Customers are excited about the delicious taste and health benefits of ginger and mint, ranging from anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, digestive aid, weight loss and many more benefits. We also provide literature regarding the teas health benefits to our consumers. It's important to educate our population on how to address simple ailment naturally without medication. Tessie's Teas is nature at its' best.</p>
<p>We have spent the majority of our funds developing an awesome product that many people aren't aware exists. We seek funding to launch a full-scale marketing campaign and increase our inventory selection. We seek 20k in funding, 7k - 10k for marketing and 10k to expand the brand ( increase inventory, cover warehouse cost, transportation, etc). All backers will receive gifted tea, amount based on contribution. Contributions of $199 or greater will receive one year's supply of our teas and literature covering the health benefits. </p>
<p>Tessie's Teas challenges have been getting the word out and serving customers out of the US who purchased our teas on vacation. We can address and solve these challenges with increased funding. We appreciate all contributions and anyone who took the time to read our request, please share it with others using the Indiegogo share tool.</p>
<p>Thank you for time and consideration,</p>

<p>That is our mission statement. We painted it on our old freight elevator door; we also crochet this on our pillows and tattoo it onto our pectoral muscles and chant it during staff meetings. It is that important. We are a brewery, but we brew more than great craft beer. We also are in the business of brewing joy, which is so corny it's awesome. We love to be a gathering space for people, and we love to connect with our customers over great food and beer.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We bought this brewery, and then we bought a homebrew kit on craigslist, because that is the correct order in which to buy these sorts of things if you want the maximum adventure ride. Brewmaster Jon was an engineer in his former life, and now puts all that energy and science into the world of craft beer, with some amazing results (including this magical peanut butter concoction). We also have a coffee shop and coffee roaster in our brewery, which provides us with the magical beans for this magical brew. </p>
<p>Check out our blog for more info on the story here: <a href=""http://www.copperstate.beer/single-post/2017/06/01/Grit-and-Grist--the-Copper-State-Story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.copperstate.beer/single-post/2017/06/01/Grit-and-Grist--the-Copper-State-Story</a></p>

<p><i>""Holy smokes, the smell of this beer is ridiculous! It's one of the most robust flavored beers I've had."" --Wayne S.</i></p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Copper State Brewing Co just turned two years old. We'd like to give ourselves a birthday present that could benefit you, something all two-year-olds desire: a nitrogen doser for our canning line. </p>
<p>To make this work, we need a few things: knowledge (check--Jon is an engineer), beer (check--Jon makes great beer), and the support of our biggest fans (check?--here's where you come in).  Our canning line needs an appendage in the form of a nitrogen doser. Appendages aren’t cheap—in fact, they cost an arm and a leg. We are aiming for a cool $25k for the equipment and install, and if we surpass this goal, we will put it towards the can design and the first pallet of cans to get us rolling. </p>
<p>Here's the science-y stuff: right before we put the beer into kegs or cans, we carbonate it. But for certain beers, we also add nitrogen, which gives the beer its creamy mouthfeel, without any bite from the CO2. When we started the brewery, we put in three nitro taplines so that we could serve some epic nitro craft on draught (doesn't look like it should rhyme, but it does). However, we cannot put a nitro beer straight into cans or crowlers or growlers from the tap because it would go flat in short order and it would not taste good. And as a rule, we don't serve beer that does not taste good. Enter: the nitro drip for our canning line, which gives each can a little nitro burst and purges all the oxygen before the lid is sealed on, ensuring a delicious creamy beer poured hard out of the can. The nitro drip doser would also benefit our other packaged beers by ensuring a longer shelf life. We would even have the capacity to do some nitro cold brew coffee in cans, which is another fun avenue to venture into...not as fun as beer, but still fun. </p>

<h3>What you Get</h3>
<p>Aside from the warm fuzzies of having helped out a new brewery with our production needs, we've got a pack of perks for you at various levels of donations. Click on the perks to get a bit more info about what is included with each one. Check 'em out, and come in and redeem them at Copper State Brewing Co.</p>
<p>*Nota Bene (that's Latin for ""note well""--isn't learning fun?): some of these perks will not be able to be redeemed until we have the nitrogen doser set up in our cellar. Email info@copperstate.beer for more details or questions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Nope, this campaign will not save puppies or fix the ozone. It will not ensure world peace or provide a cure for cancer. It will, however, enable us to get fantastic beer out into the marketplace for you to share with your friends. Also, with more success of the brewery, we will be able to give back more to our growing downtown community. We serve beer at various fundraising events, and donate tours and gift cards and merch to many fundraisers throughout the year, so I guess in some ways, our beer <i>does</i> cure cancer and save puppies and feed starving artists. It's just that good at being beer. </p>
<p>Your donations will enable us to help the community. They will also allow us to increase our distribution farther across the great state of Wisconsin and into your house. </p>

<h3>Coffeehouse and Bakery</h3>
<p>My name is Jeremy McMaster. Since 2009 my wife and I have been the owners and operators of Teahouse of the Mullah Nasrudin's Donkey LLC. I roast coffee at my home and sell it online and we participate annually at the Great Dickens Christmas Fair by operating our coffee business there under the name ""Mr. Browns Fine Coffee and Teas"". Since the beginning of the pandemic I have been selling baked goods from my home kitchen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently I am baking from my home. I would need funding to not only pay a lease to have a place but I also need to equip it with convection ovens, counters, a standing floor mixer, refrigeration, ventilation, an espresso machine, small wares, furniture, start-up funding.</p>
<p>This is not going to be cheap. I believe I will need close to $75,000 to obtain a location (I am looking in the Bay Area for former restaurants), purchase equipment, obtain permits, decorate and become ready for customers.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have a nice place where I can produce my wares and folks can either get their morning coffee and/or chai with a baked good or enjoy acoustic music or gaming or recite poetry or just hang out in the evening/ night.</p>

</div></div>","Coffeehouse and Bakery
My name is Jeremy McMaster. Since 2009 my wife and I have been the owners and operators of Teahouse of the Mullah Nasrudin's Donkey LLC. I roast coffee at my home and sell it online and we participate annually at the Great Dickens Christmas Fair by operating our coffee business there under the name ""Mr. Browns Fine Coffee and Teas"". Since the beginning of the pandemic I have been selling baked goods from my home kitchen.

What We Need & What You Get
Currently I am baking from my home. I would need funding to not only pay a lease to have a place but I also need to equip it with convection ovens, counters, a standing floor mixer, refrigeration, ventilation, an espresso machine, small wares, furniture, start-up funding.
This is not going to be cheap. I believe I will need close to $75,000 to obtain a location (I am looking in the Bay Area for former restaurants), purchase equipment, obtain permits, decorate and become ready for customers.
Our goal is to have a nice place where I can produce my wares and folks can either get their morning coffee and/or chai with a baked good or enjoy acoustic music or gaming or recite poetry or just hang out in the evening/ night.

This increases their revenue above what they would make cultivating coca.</p><p>Next, we give them access to technology, using an application we have designed that will allow you to trace not only the origin of the cacao in your chocolate, but also the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of your chocolate consumption. This application is designed to create traceability and transparency in the value chain, which will allow farmers to grow their enterprises, and build a life with dignity.  It gets nerdy fast, so if you want to know more about how this whole thing works, check out our <a href=""https://choco4peace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, or get in touch and we'd be happy to tell you all about it!</p><h2>what your contribution will do</h2><p>It sounds straightforward, but we'll be producing the chocolate you're looking for. That takes a lot of coordination.</p><p>We have spent the last two years building the right partnerships, not only so you can feed your chocolate addiction, but really so that we can allow you to trace and measure the impact of your dollars (Euros, Pesos, Shekels...).</p><p>Your cacao will travel on a long journey before it gets to your sweet faces. It has to be harvested, fermented, dried, sorted, tested, inspected, shipped around the world, sorted again, tested again, shelled, ground, liquefied, aged, tested <i>again</i>, set into molds, labeled - and THEN we can send it to you.</p><p>Phew!</p><h3>Goal 1: Access to market for 50 families - $25,000</h3><p>This money will enable us to set up the infrastructure to support approximately 50 families to import 1 tonne of their cacao to Montreal, Canada, and for our chocolate maker partner to transform it into chocolate just for you!</p><h3>Goal 2: Access to technology - $75,000</h3><p>In collaboration with our partners, we have designed a modular application that will allow us to trace the cacao along its journey to be transformed into chocolate. This application will enable you to trace not only the origin of the cacao, but also the socioeconomic and environmental impacts this chocolate has, and build greater transparency and trust within the chocolate ecosystem. With another $50k, we will be able to build the first two modules of this application.</p><h3>Goal 3: Scaling up - $125,000</h3><p>As we mentioned, there are a lot of cacao farmers in Colombia.

dig·ni·ty /ˈdiɡnədē / nounthe state or quality of being worthy of honour or respect. a sense of pride in oneself; self-respect.Our purpose is to build lives with dignity. Full stop. Everything else is just steps in between.One of the cacaoteros in the Santander region of Colombia, with C4P Executive Director Sergio Figueredothis isn't just chocolate, this is a movement.What if I told you that the reason much of the chocolate we eat is so cheap is directly related to child slavery in Africa and cocaine production in Colombia?Choco4Peace works to enable vulnerable Colombian farmers to improve their lives by finding markets for their chocolate-producing cacao, allowing them to escape poverty and conflict. Our social enterprise supports constructing and sustaining peace by generating positive socioeconomic and environmental outcomes in post-conflict regions through the empowerment of women, youth, indigenous and other at-risk people in the cacao sectors by providing access to markets, capacity building, and disruptive technologies.Raw cacao: this is what your chocolate looks like at the beginning of its journeywhat's the problem?There are over 38,000 cacao farmers in Colombia, and over 70% of them live below the poverty line (less than $2 USD/day). These farmers face the awful dilemma of either farming crops like cacao in poverty or returning to cocaine production as a means of survival.We need your support to show the world that we can prevent future armed conflicts and cocaine production.Check out this video by Vice about why the war on drugs is failing:Tumaco is a town on the Pacific coast of Colombia, which in addition to having 80% poverty rate and 74% unemployment rate, it is also the largest coca producing region in the world. We are working with a group of courageous farmers in Tumaco who have successfully made the transition to growing cacao. Nevertheless, they are at risk of falling back into dangerous cocaine production because they don’t have access to markets, fair prices, technology, and other services.what are we doing?We start by connecting farmers with chocolate makers who will pay them fair prices for their cacao. This increases their revenue above what they would make cultivating coca.Next, we give them access to technology, using an application we have designed that will allow you to trace not only the origin of the cacao in your chocolate, but also the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of your chocolate consumption. This application is designed to create traceability and transparency in the value chain, which will allow farmers to grow their enterprises, and build a life with dignity.  It gets nerdy fast, so if you want to know more about how this whole thing works, check out our website, or get in touch and we'd be happy to tell you all about it!what your contribution will doIt sounds straightforward, but we'll be producing the chocolate you're looking for. That takes a lot of coordination.We have spent the last two years building the right partnerships, not only so you can feed your chocolate addiction, but really so that we can allow you to trace and measure the impact of your dollars (Euros, Pesos, Shekels...).Your cacao will travel on a long journey before it gets to your sweet faces. It has to be harvested, fermented, dried, sorted, tested, inspected, shipped around the world, sorted again, tested again, shelled, ground, liquefied, aged, tested again, set into molds, labeled - and THEN we can send it to you.Phew!Goal 1: Access to market for 50 families - $25,000This money will enable us to set up the infrastructure to support approximately 50 families to import 1 tonne of their cacao to Montreal, Canada, and for our chocolate maker partner to transform it into chocolate just for you!Goal 2: Access to technology - $75,000In collaboration with our partners, we have designed a modular application that will allow us to trace the cacao along its journey to be transformed into chocolate. This application will enable you to trace not only the origin of the cacao, but also the socioeconomic and environmental impacts this chocolate has, and build greater transparency and trust within the chocolate ecosystem. With another $50k, we will be able to build the first two modules of this application.Goal 3: Scaling up - $125,000As we mentioned, there are a lot of cacao farmers in Colombia. The higher your demand for ethical chocolate, the more reason farmers have to keep growin' the beans! So far, we have agreements with 7 cacao cooperatives in 4 regions of the country representing about 1000 farmers. How sweet is that?!who are we?(Some of) the choco crew!We're a bunch of international development geeks, economists, business people, ethicists, designers, communicators, polyglots, and chocolate lovers. You can check out our full kick-butt team on our shiny new website!We align and measure our work with six of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Check out how on our website.Founder and Executive Director | Sergio Figueredo has more than 8 years of experience in business development, investment management working for financial service providers (FSPs), non-profits, development finance institutions (DFIs) and NGOs. While studying at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Sergio managed the business accounts for TCF Bank and later on, he joined JP Morgan Chase to assist high-net-worth clients to determine investment needs. His interest in sustainable development and social investments inspired him to work with different NGO’s including ANED, a DFI in Bolivia where he was in charge of research and development from micro-finance programs aiming to improve the quality of life of low-income families by empowering women.Later on, Sergio directed the development of an online financial matchmaking platform, AXiiS (Access and eXchange for Impact Investment and Sustainability) that connects Financial Service Providers (FSP) with investment-ready Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs). After the successful launch, AXiiS reached with 6.4 billion USD worth of FSP’s assets under management and SMEs in over 20 countries throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa, Sergio focused on developing institutional partnerships with international investors, governments, and NGOs.Further, in collaboration with Alianza Cacao, Sergio was responsible for the finance component of an effort to reactivate the cacao sector in El Salvador, build local capacity and support cocoa SMEs to be credit-ready and be matched with FSPs through AXiiS.join us in showing the world how sweet is chocolate for peace...Thank you for your support. It matters.Here are some of the others who are supporting us on our journey so far: Former and current presidents have given their endorsement for the project. Click this image to learn more about Colombia's interest in disruptive technologyChocolate makers, technology companies, UN and government agencies, crop insurance companies, trade organizations, family offices, and the anti-narcotics special forces of Colombia.Topl - our disruptive technology partnerOur growing network of partnersRisks and challengesThe biggest challenge in getting you your chocolate, honestly, will be if we try to ship it to you in the summer. It will probably just melt in the mail, and that will make us all sad.We live in Canada though, and it's frigid at least half the year. That's a better time to get it to you. After all, you'd probably rather we spend your money on supporting farmers, instead of freezer packs for your chocolate, right? How do you feel about holding off until, say, September?Obviously, it's also risky working in Colombia. Tumaco is still a dangerous part of the country, and travel there is not without risks. But, we have the support of the United Nations, who keep us safe when we go.Moreover, the peace accord negotiated in 2016 is fragile. When the FARC demobilized, other illegal armed groups moved in to fill the vacuum. And the peace transition process is long and complex. There is still a chance the deal could fail. But there are a LOT of smart, dedicated people working on this problem. We have the opportunity to build a movement to support this process. That starts with making sure farmers have lives with dignity so they don't return to illegal activity.Join us; #ElCacaoSoyYo -- DignidadCualidad del que se hace valer como persona, se comporta con responsabilidad, seriedad y con respeto hacia sí mismo y hacia los demás.Nuestro propósito es construir vidas con dignidad. Nada más. Todo lo demás son pasos intermedios.(Uno de los cacaoteros en la región de Santander, Colombia, con el Director Ejecutivo de C4P, Sergio Figueredo.​)Esto no es solo chocolate, esto es un movimiento..""¿Qué pasaría si te dijera que la mayor parte del chocolate que comemos, que es tan barato, está directamente relacionado con la esclavitud infantil en África y la producción de cocaína en Colombia? ""Choco4Peace trabaja para que los agricultores colombianos puedan mejorar sus vidas al encontrar mercados para su producción de cacao, esto les permite escapar de la pobreza y de situaciones de conflicto. Nuestra empresa social apoya a la construcción y al mantenimiento de la paz a partir de la generación de resultados socioeconómicos y medioambientales positivos en las regiones de pos-conflicto a través del empoderamiento de las mujeres, los jóvenes, las comunidades indígenas y otros actores del sector del cacao, brindando acceso a mercados, al desarrollo de capacidades y a la utilización de nuevas tecnologías.(Cacao crudo- fruta: así es como se ve tu chocolate al inicio)Cual es el problema?Hay más de 38,000 productores de cacao en Colombia, de los cuales, más del 70% de viven por debajo del umbral de la pobreza (menos de $ 2 USD al día). Estos agricultores enfrentan el terrible dilema de seguir cultivando cacao en condiciones de pobreza o de involucrarse en el cultivo y producción de cocaína como medio de supervivencia.Necesitamos tu apoyo para demostrarle al mundo que podemos trabajar para prevenir futuros conflictos armados y desincentivar la producción de cocaína.Echa un vistazo a este video para entender por qué está fallando la guerra contra las drogas:Tumaco es una ciudad ubicada en la costa pacífica de Colombia, que además de tener una tasa de pobreza del 80% y una tasa de desempleo del 74%, también es la región productora de coca más grande del mundo. Estamos trabajando con un grupo de valerosos agricultores en Tumaco que han hecho con éxito la transición al cultivo de cacao. Sin embargo, estos productores siguen en peligro de volver a caer en la peligrosa producción de cocaína porque aún les falta apoyo para el acceso a mercados, precios justos, tecnología y otros servicios.Que estamos haciendo?Comenzamos conectando a los agricultores con fabricantes de chocolate que les pagarán precios justos por su cacao. Esto aumenta sus ingresos por encima de lo que harían cultivando coca.A continuación, les damos acceso a la tecnología, mediante una aplicación que hemos diseñado y que te permitirá rastrear no solo el origen del cacao en tu barra de chocolate, sino también te hará saber los impactos socioeconómicos y ambientales derivados de tu compra. Esta aplicación está diseñada para crear trazabilidad y transparencia en la cadena de valor, lo que permitirá a los agricultores hacer crecer sus empresas y construir una vida digna. Sabemos que es un poco complicado, pero si quieres saber más sobre cómo funciona todo esto, te invitamos a visitar nuestro sitio web o a contáctarnos. Estaremos encantados de contártelo todo!¿Qué logrará tu contribución?Parece sencillo, pero producir el chocolate que siempre has querido probar requiere mucha coordinación!Hemos pasado los últimos dos años buscando y logrando las conexiones correctas,no solo para que puedas alimentar tu adicción al chocolate, sino también para que puedas rastrear y medir el impacto de tus pesos (euros, dolares, shekels ...).El cacao hará un largo viaje antes de llegar a tus manos. Deberá ser cosechado, fermentado, secado, clasificado, probado, inspeccionado, enviado alrededor del mundo, clasificado nuevamente, probado nuevamente, molido, licuado, probado nuevamente, moldeado, etiquetado - y DESPUES estará listo para ser enviado.Ufff!Meta 1: Acceso al mercado para 50 familias - $ 25,000 USEste dinero nos permitirá configurar la infraestructura para que aproximadamente 50 familias,  productoras de cacao colombianas, importen 1 tonelada de su cacao a Montreal, Canadá, y para que nuestro chocolatero aliado lo transforme en delicioso chocolate.​Meta 2: Acceso a la tecnología - $ 75,000 USEn colaboración con nuestros socios, hemos diseñado una aplicación modular que nos permitirá rastrear el cacao a lo largo de su viaje para transformarlo en chocolate. Esta aplicación le permitirá rastrear no solo el origen del cacao, sino también los impactos socioeconómicos y medioambientales que tiene este chocolate. Con esto, logramos construir una mayor transparencia y confianza dentro del ecosistema del chocolate. Con otros $ 50,000, podremos construir los dos primeros módulos de esta aplicación.Meta 3: Escalar - $ 125,000Como te mencionamos, hay muchos productores de cacao en Colombia. Cuanto mayor sea tu consumo de chocolate ético, mayor será la razón por la cual los agricultores seguirán cultivando este cacao! Hasta ahora, tenemos acuerdos con 7 cooperativas de cacao en 4 regiones del país, estas cooperativas representan aproximadamente 1000 agricultores. ¡Qué te parece eso!Quienes somos?(Algunos miembros del choco-team!)Somos un grupo de apasionados por el desarrollo internacional, economistas, empresarios, diseñadores, comunicadores, políglotas y amantes del chocolate. ¡Puedes ver nuestro equipo completo en nuestro nuevo pagina web.Alineamos y medimos nuestro trabajo con seis de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) establecidos por las Naciones Unidas.
