I, along with my brothers, were born with a rare blood disorder called Diamond Blackfan Anemia. This medical condition has resulted in a need for an abundance of medication, multiple surgeries, and well over 100 blood transfusions throughout my life. While these transfusions are medically necessary, they can also cause iron overload, which can damage the heart and liver. You can read more about my family in a People magazine article that came out early 2018(<a href=""https://people.com/human-interest/four-brothers-fatal-disease-fight-lives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://people.com/human-interest/four-brothers...</a>).As you can imagine the emotional and financial stress on families with this and other blood disorders is tremendous. The solution for many of us suffering with these challenges is as simple as finding a bone marrow donor. For the past 6 years, my family and I have been working with DKMS, which is the world’s largest bone marrow registry. My family and I have been on a mission to not only find donors for my brothers and myself, but to help find donors for the thousands of others with blood disorder related diseases and cancers fin their match and save their lives. In the last 6 years, my family's efforts have brought in 28,000 new donors registrations that have led to 116 life saving transplants. While my brothers and I have not yet found our match, we are hopeful that those phone calls will come any day now. My family through grassroots efforts, like setting up stands at churches, local sporting events, and colleges, managed to register all the donors. As a creative type, I thought about how I could do more. So, a few years ago, I started to write an outline for “Miles to Go.” I thought if I could create a T.V. show that was funny, entertaining, and insert information about how easy it is to become a bone marrow donor, more people would be inclined to see if they are a match.  We will share real stories of people whose lives have been saved by a bone marrow donation. I imagine we can have over 100,000 donors inspired to see if they are someone’s match and save even more lives.  With the encouragement of my family and agent, I have decided to jump forward and make this show happen now. I’m thrilled to have Co-founder Katharina Harf and DKMS to help advise for the project. We would like to invite you to be apart of helping us shoot the pilot, no dollar amount is too small or too large to help create this entertaining series with a mission. It is not every day a T.V show can help save lives.</p></div>","My name is Sean Murry and I am a Producer/Actor living in St. Louis, MO.

<p>It's been far too long for East Asian actors to take on very minor and stereotyped roles in movies and theatres. It might have got a little bit better in America, but in the UK, I am still seeing my fellow actors being casted for very minor roles, probably a martial arts role at best. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>From the bottom... on the rise to the top, Mr. James Boudreaux is set to become Memphis' first black owned brokerage firm owner. He is planning to build a life of black wealth with his best friend and business partner, Levan St. Bernard. But of course, if it's too good to be true, it probably is! James never understood the challenges that come with building a life on secrets and lies, until now. He knows what life is like in the streets but he never thought it would be worse in business. You see, in the streets, everybody gets their hands dirty. In business, you have to know how to do dirt but keep your hands clean. James is starting to realize that the most TOXIC people are those who disguise themselves as family and friends, or is it just THE MAN IN THE MIRROR? When dealing with devils, sometimes you have to become The Devil. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WRITER/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER</strong></p>
<p>My name is Tymika Chambliss and I've been acting in community theater and film for over 10 years and writing for over 20 years. From short stories to theater productions, writing has been a consistent passion since the age of 10. In 2014 I began drafting the storyline and character breakdowns for TOXIC. After brainstorming, researching, and praying, I decided to take my script, build a cast, shoot the trailer and pilot, and find a way to bring it to homes across the globe. As you may know, those steps, although fun and rewarding, wasn't free. I funded the entire project, thus far, out of pocket, and now I need your help to complete it. (continue below)</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586467921/hq79bcsuz8kobboemyj7.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p>This project separates itself from others in its attention to detail. The truth is in the details. We have award winning theater actors, award winning filmmaker, award winning director, and more. Having made these connections, our story line leads us forward and we have the foundation in place to take this pilot into the television market. </p>
<p>In supporting this series, you are supporting WORKING MOTHERS, WOMEN, AND MEN who are keeping their families together, while creating quality entertainment for the world.  </p>
<p>Given the talent and dedication to this project, we want everyone to get paid for the work they put in. As a struggling actor, I have participated in MANY projects where I was simply given a slice of pizza and credit and spent my own money on other expenses. I do not want TOXIC to be that kind of project! Our actors are professional and should be PAID for their commitment and the work they put into every passing moment in front of the camera. We want the end product to be QUALITY. </p>
<p>We are making something big and we are not looking back.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>So... why this project?</strong></h3>
<p>TOXIC is a story of hard work, dedication, and redemption. However, we are changing the narrative of the typical story of a black man in America. </p>
<p>James Boudreaux is...</p>
<ul>
<li>A black man who grew up in the hood</li>
<li>A black man whose father abandoned him </li>
<li>A black man who found family in gang life</li>
<li>A black man who went to jail</li>
<li>A black man who decided to turn his life around</li>
<li>A black man who went to college and graduated</li>
<li>A black man who had everything against him and HE MADE IT!</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Overview
From the bottom... on the rise to the top, Mr. James Boudreaux is set to become Memphis' first black owned brokerage firm owner. He is planning to build a life of black wealth with his best friend and business partner, Levan St. Bernard. But of course, if it's too good to be true, it probably is! James never understood the challenges that come with building a life on secrets and lies, until now. He knows what life is like in the streets but he never thought it would be worse in business. You see, in the streets, everybody gets their hands dirty. In business, you have to know how to do dirt but keep your hands clean. James is starting to realize that the most TOXIC people are those who disguise themselves as family and friends, or is it just THE MAN IN THE MIRROR? When dealing with devils, sometimes you have to become The Devil. 
 
WRITER/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER
My name is Tymika Chambliss and I've been acting in community theater and film for over 10 years and writing for over 20 years. From short stories to theater productions, writing has been a consistent passion since the age of 10. In 2014 I began drafting the storyline and character breakdowns for TOXIC. After brainstorming, researching, and praying, I decided to take my script, build a cast, shoot the trailer and pilot, and find a way to bring it to homes across the globe. As you may know, those steps, although fun and rewarding, wasn't free. I funded the entire project, thus far, out of pocket, and now I need your help to complete it. (continue below)

 
This project separates itself from others in its attention to detail. The truth is in the details. We have award winning theater actors, award winning filmmaker, award winning director, and more. Having made these connections, our story line leads us forward and we have the foundation in place to take this pilot into the television market. 
In supporting this series, you are supporting WORKING MOTHERS, WOMEN, AND MEN who are keeping their families together, while creating quality entertainment for the world.  
Given the talent and dedication to this project, we want everyone to get paid for the work they put in. As a struggling actor, I have participated in MANY projects where I was simply given a slice of pizza and credit and spent my own money on other expenses. I do not want TOXIC to be that kind of project! Our actors are professional and should be PAID for their commitment and the work they put into every passing moment in front of the camera. We want the end product to be QUALITY. 
We are making something big and we are not looking back.
 
So... why this project?
TOXIC is a story of hard work, dedication, and redemption. However, we are changing the narrative of the typical story of a black man in America. 
James Boudreaux is...

A black man who grew up in the hood
A black man whose father abandoned him 
A black man who found family in gang life
A black man who went to jail
A black man who decided to turn his life around
A black man who went to college and graduated
A black man who had everything against him and HE MADE IT!

TOXIC follows the life of James Boudreaux; a dreamer, fighter, father, and entrepreneur. He is determined to create black wealth and teach others along the way. Yes, he will encounter struggles, unbearable hurt, heartache, heartbreak, chaos, and scandals along the way but he is a fighter and his fight began the moment he inhaled his first breathe on this earth and the fight won't end until his dream of being the first black brokerage firm owner, in Memphis, TN is accomplished.
One of the underline themes of TOXIC is spirituality and the importance of connecting to a higher power. We wanted to be cautious in not promoting religion because religion tends to be the thread that blinds the characters but abandons the audience. No matter where a person's life takes them, they can always find guidance and solitude by being connected.
Too many times, the media has not given Black Men and Women the opportunity to create their own narrative to their own story. BlackBox Productions, minority owned and operated, found it necessary to give a voice to our stories and truth to our lives.
 

What Do We Hope To Accomplish?

Seasons of undeniable, drama packed, quality entertainment
Display the positive outcomes of second chances
We want to show how the characters transitioned out of hopelessness into prosperity
Show the audience that there are multiple paths to success and every path isn't traditional. Because life is 10% of what is thrown at you and 90% of how you choose to handle it. 
Show the audience  how to increase their opportunities by expanding their network of influence.
Expand our platform from YouTube to syndicated television and/or streaming platforms (ie: Netflix, Hulu, Quibi, etc.)

<p>First of all, I would like to greet you with my luxurious portrait and then thank you immensely, in taking the time to consider donating to this project. I am Eoxander the creator of Emigration Propagation. I'm a real-life nomad /really, a real nomad... livestock and all, not the digital kind/,  living in Berlin, in love with Germany. I have lived in Germany for the past 2 years often times wondering I might as well BE an actual alien. During my time here, a stream of bizarre incidents that I personally witnessed or things that I've heard, together with my passion for animated comedies, kept boiling itself into a story and led me to create this project. </p>
<p>What is this about? Humans... Us... You  know? What makes it so that we are always looking out into the universe for mysteries, when there are so much to explore within our humanity, right here on this earth. Like what makes that one asshole dislike a ""Cute Puppy Compilations"" or a ""10 hours of white noise, black screen"" <i>/That's exactly what you asked for, dick!/</i> Youtube video? Cue:</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Emigration Propagation</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Basic Premise</u></strong></p>
<p>Two completely opposite alien shipmates crash land in Germany. They are scared of us as we are of them. Like you know how when you see a rat or god forbid- a fucken cockroach and you scream to the high heavens... well, so do the rats and the cockroaches. Imagine seeing a giant hairless or exoskeleton-less motherfucker with a mouth that is multiple times your own body size. Yeah, that's how they feel. ANYWAY, they are immediately chased by BND agents /<i>which is the equivalent of CIA in the US and a A</i>/. So they must hide, but obviously they cannot get so far on their own, but Jeremy Ron befriends a bookstore owner Emma, who hides them in her apartment. But she will not be enough to save them, they must gain other allies to help them. We follow their journey as they attempt to integrate within this society and deal with daily bat-shit adventures while they question if they <i>hate</i> living on this AWESOME earth or <i>love it</i>- even with all the stupidity in it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>*NOTE: THESE IMAGES&amp;VIDEOS ARE DRAWN WITH THIS DUDE'S EXTREMELY LIMITED ""SKILLS"". THESE ARE MERELY MEANT TO  PROVOKE A FEEL. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE DRAWN AND ANIMATED BY PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS.</p>
<p><u><strong>Characters</strong></u></p>
<p><u>The Alien Race A.K.A The U/uuu/i's:</u> These aliens are built to be the perfect beings. They have been around for so long that they are evolved to be absolutely efficient. Kind of like... Germans. Or what they are <i>perceived</i> to be like /<i>they're humans too, dick</i>/. These creatures have been through everything our civilization has been through. So now they live in a planet they built for themselves instead of relying on nature, pffft lame. The Ui's are physically superior to us too. For instance, their limbs are the same length because if they are fleeing or are in pursuit they can run as fast as a greyhound on all fours. Their eyes are big and black because the black outer layer protects them from harmful radiations. So they can just stare into the sun as long as they want. But the most impressive part is that them being the perfect creatures they are, they don’t even have sex. No, not that kind… I mean gender: male or female. Because it is just so inefficient to depend on another sex to reproduce. You want a baby? You can squeeze one out yourself. So these creatures, should be rightly called a female. But they don't have the concept, so they can't argue with being called a dude. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<u>Jeremy ""The Giant"" Ron a.k.a Ron Jeremy</u>: A gentle giant. A kind hearted, goofy giant alien who is considered a loser on his planet. <i>And</i> an idiot… He's the kind of a dude who wears a Hawaii holiday shirt with <i>both</i> bow and office ties. He is convinced that it makes him more human. But don’t take his gentleness for weakness. He can wreak absolute hell if you give him the reason to. He is after all, is the son of two of the most famous Ui's on planet Tiki.</li></ul>

<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<u>Napoleon ""The Asshole""</u>: Leon is abruptly named an asshole because he is just a miserable little guy. As it implies in his given name /given by Ron/ he has a Napoleon complex. But he’s not that small /<i>and neither was Napoleon/</i>, he’s about as tall as a regular white northern European dude, which is pretty tall. He was brought up to do no wrong. But that all changes when he discovers weed on this planet. He then becomes a paranoid, even bigger asshole with a recurring psychosis.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620156148/nhs38c1l46rhzozxj6dj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Emmeline ""Emma"" Carpenter</u>: Her rich family traces their origins from Germany. But culturally she’s as German as Michael Jordan. She is many things, self described, of course: An activist, a spiritualist and a free thinker. She came to Germany because she had enough of her spoon-fed life in the U.S. So she came to Germany to discover her origins and to be fed by a silver spoon abroad. Although her bookstore doesn’t generate enough income, her being white and American, she never seem to encounter any problems with her visa.</li>
<li>
<u>Mesut Mahmut</u>: Ah, his names meaning “Fortunate Prince”... But not really. He was named with two first names because his parents didn’t want to decide on one. He is the exact opposite of the ideal Turkish son - He is a party loving, damn-near alcoholic womanizer but most importantly – he speaks very softly. What’s even more funny is that he has ginger hair and beard. He just always looks like he’s been sleep deprived and high, even when he is not. He is an immigrant, as such relates to our duo about the struggles and hardships immigrants endure.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Along with these characters we have a myriad of other recurring characters with their unique stories and voices, who make up this beautiful boiling pot blend we call - <i>Berlin</i>. </p>

<p>The world we find ourselves in is the fictional and wacky version of Berlin <i>and</i> the world where the stereotypes are ever more stronger. Before you get mad, stereotypes are funny because it's true,... 60% of the time, every time. Don't want to spoil too much here, so we'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Outside of our earth we will explore the life on our protagonists' planet The TikTikTik /<i>pronounced dkdkdk like how a dolphin clicks</i>/. </p>
<ul><li>
<u><i>A note on why the show is in English:</i> </u>I realize some of you might be asking, if it is made and based in Germany why is it not in German? Well I'll tell you why. Whether we like it or not English is the IT language. Don't believe me? Ask your child /if you have one/ or your nephews and nieces who is the coolest kid in their school... Probably the student who raps and curses in English and does TikTok videos. <i>Also</i> for the universal appeal, of course. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How You Can Help &amp; Your Rewards</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need the initial fund to get the streaming platform up and running, get a whole animation and production team and jumpstart the marketing. This is where I ask for your donations. Every little bit helps.</li>
<li>
<i>DO</i> Check out our awesome perks, there is one for every level. From a premium account on our website to having a character modeled after your appearance. Fun stuff. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We will be totally transparent about budget spending and post updates once we start spending funds, but in foresight it goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Domain/Servers: To handle ANY traffic and demand, we will be looking to secure the highest spec platform available to the budget.</li>
<li>Animation Studio: By far the biggest spending of our budget, we will be looking to hire a talented team of animation production studio and other talents which include but not limited to: Storyboarders, a <i>bunch</i> of Animators and artists, Editors, Sound Designers, Art Directors, Voice Actors and a whole lot of others to make the pilot. /more episodes if we raise enough money/</li>
<li>Business Manager: We will hire an experienced professional who is in the know-how of the streaming industry to handle potential income sources to sustain the series, and to foresee marketing and business development aspects, to grow the show and the studio. </li>
<li>Lawyer: We will hire an experienced media lawyer on a consulting basis to handle the licensing, media practice and all other legal stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our promise to you is that no matter how our method of income may turn out to be, one way or another our series will <strong>ALWAYS be FREE</strong> for everyone to see as long as we can afford to keep our website on.  </p>
<p>Even if we cannot raise the goal, we would still need every bit that we did raise so that we can begin the animation process and secure <i>our</i> part of the capital while still looking for a private investor to work out a partnership. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Aim: Social Commentary</strong></h3>
<p>I realize you might be asking yourself ""Do we need a show like this?"" I certainly think we do. In a time, such as today, when there are so much division and hatred in the world we <i>need  </i>to learn to laugh AT ourselves, TO understand and empathize with one another. Historically, humor has always been a way for humans to better a difficult situation and ease tension, even if it meant making fun of others. More and more each day we see ""Oh gee, you don't think I'm right? Do you not share my views or values, well, go hump yourself!"" Cancel that, cancel this!"" People's attempt to silence or ""cancel"" one another is a form of oppression in the digital space. There's no other way of putting it, honestly. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620156405/we3oosgpe1bbub9i81iz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Part of the reason why our show <i>has </i>to be on an independent platform is because of prevalence of cancel culture in our society. Networks and broadcasters are now afraid of airing some things that some people may not want to hear and will eventually try to censor the programs on their platform. </p>
<p>And so I must stress, this show <i>will</i> contain some humor, jokes and dialogues some may consider anti-PC or Politically Incorrect. </p>
<p>Aside from that, we just want to make a decent entertainment for everyone to enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>Inevitably, there will be many difficulties and challenges considering that the visual medium is one of the most fragile way to entertain.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious problem we face is: Will people like it enough to return for future episodes?  Cause it's simple right? No viewers = No revenue = No sustenance. That question, I'm afraid, does not have a straight answer. I'm sure some people will hate it, but then again some people like cock-fights. Although what I <i>can</i> say with certainty is this: Our team will give <i>everything</i> we have got and then some, to create this show. And this is not just a blind promise. My family's livelihood and my personal integrity as a storyteller is being waged.</p>
<p>Worse-comes-to-worst if we have to end all operations on account of running out of funding and unable to bring on an investor /<i>knock, knock, knock on wood/ </i> we will release all available materials such as animated parts, behind the scenes, drawings, artworks etc, online. </p>
<p>But the bottom line is, this is <i>your</i> product, paid for and by <i>you</i>, and we will not stop until we deliver your product to the best of our abilities. </p>
<p>On a lighter note. IF best comes to pass and with success of the show, our studio will fund and host up-and-coming animated shows, writers and storytellers to give you even better and diverse comedy shows. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's hard to give money away during a difficult time such as this, it's not like money grows on trees /<i>last I checked</i>/. What you can simply do to help us is you can spread the word with your preferred platforms, get our project noticed. Hey, you're still a fucken legend in our eyes. </p>

Whether we like it or not English is the IT language. Don't believe me? Ask your child /if you have one/ or your nephews and nieces who is the coolest kid in their school... Probably the student who raps and curses in English and does TikTok videos. Also for the universal appeal, of course.

DO Check out our awesome perks, there is one for every level. From a premium account on our website to having a character modeled after your appearance. Fun stuff. 

 
We will be totally transparent about budget spending and post updates once we start spending funds, but in foresight it goes as follows:

Domain/Servers: To handle ANY traffic and demand, we will be looking to secure the highest spec platform available to the budget.
Animation Studio: By far the biggest spending of our budget, we will be looking to hire a talented team of animation production studio and other talents which include but not limited to: Storyboarders, a bunch of Animators and artists, Editors, Sound Designers, Art Directors, Voice Actors and a whole lot of others to make the pilot. /more episodes if we raise enough money/
Business Manager: We will hire an experienced professional who is in the know-how of the streaming industry to handle potential income sources to sustain the series, and to foresee marketing and business development aspects, to grow the show and the studio. 
Lawyer: We will hire an experienced media lawyer on a consulting basis to handle the licensing, media practice and all other legal stuff.

Our promise to you is that no matter how our method of income may turn out to be, one way or another our series will ALWAYS be FREE for everyone to see as long as we can afford to keep our website on.  
Even if we cannot raise the goal, we would still need every bit that we did raise so that we can begin the animation process and secure our part of the capital while still looking for a private investor to work out a partnership. 

Aim: Social Commentary
I realize you might be asking yourself ""Do we need a show like this?"" I certainly think we do. In a time, such as today, when there are so much division and hatred in the world we need  to learn to laugh AT ourselves, TO understand and empathize with one another. Historically, humor has always been a way for humans to better a difficult situation and ease tension, even if it meant making fun of others. More and more each day we see ""Oh gee, you don't think I'm right? Do you not share my views or values, well, go hump yourself!"" Cancel that, cancel this!"" People's attempt to silence or ""cancel"" one another is a form of oppression in the digital space. There's no other way of putting it, honestly. 

Part of the reason why our show has to be on an independent platform is because of prevalence of cancel culture in our society. Networks and broadcasters are now afraid of airing some things that some people may not want to hear and will eventually try to censor the programs on their platform. 
And so I must stress, this show will contain some humor, jokes and dialogues some may consider anti-PC or Politically Incorrect. 
Aside from that, we just want to make a decent entertainment for everyone to enjoy.

The Road Ahead
Inevitably, there will be many difficulties and challenges considering that the visual medium is one of the most fragile way to entertain.
One of the most obvious problem we face is: Will people like it enough to return for future episodes?  Cause it's simple right? No viewers = No revenue = No sustenance. That question, I'm afraid, does not have a straight answer. I'm sure some people will hate it, but then again some people like cock-fights. Although what I can say with certainty is this: Our team will give everything we have got and then some, to create this show. And this is not just a blind promise. My family's livelihood and my personal integrity as a storyteller is being waged.
Worse-comes-to-worst if we have to end all operations on account of running out of funding and unable to bring on an investor /knock, knock, knock on wood/  we will release all available materials such as animated parts, behind the scenes, drawings, artworks etc, online. 
But the bottom line is, this is your product, paid for and by you, and we will not stop until we deliver your product to the best of our abilities. 
On a lighter note. IF best comes to pass and with success of the show, our studio will fund and host up-and-coming animated shows, writers and storytellers to give you even better and diverse comedy shows. 

Other Ways You Can Help
It's hard to give money away during a difficult time such as this, it's not like money grows on trees /last I checked/. What you can simply do to help us is you can spread the word with your preferred platforms, get our project noticed. Hey, you're still a fucken legend in our eyes.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>3rd is the lodging, a hotel close to the convention center, averaging out to roughly $300 a night, as prices go up for such a momentous event in Columbus OH. </li>
<li>4th is the registration fees and event tickets. AKA usually charges $120 per event per category. Each competitor is entering into Men’s 2-Arm Long Cycle, 10 minutes.

<li>Finally in the budget is a 10% contingency plan in case something comes up, and we always know something comes up that might bite us in the backside.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Equipment</u>: 16kgs @ $45 X 4 = $180</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We created Black Wall Street Burning, telling the story of the 1921 massacre in Tulsa, OK’s Greenwood district. With the series we are looking to layout just how prosperous this community was and we want to do it in a live drama.</p>
<p>This community housed luxury shops, a bank, multiple grocery stores, night clubs, movie theater, private planes and so much more in the early 1900’s. This community was home too many black millionaires, doctors, lawyers, and other entrepreneurs that increased the net worth of Tulsa to that which could potentially revival wall street.</p>
<p>This place was Wakanda before there was a Wakanda. It is our duty to show our children and even ourselves what that looked like in live action. Our hope is that this can be an inspiration to get us back to such a place. </p>
<p>This series will showcase prosperity in a community of black people like no other. A hidden history wrapped with prestige and with challenges from their wroth white counterparts.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is our goal to bring Black Wall Street series to life on your TV, phone, tablet, and computer. In order to make all of this happen we will need to raise at minimum $1.5 million dollars and you can become a part of history by helping us fund this project. We will need to rent camera equipment and lenses, lights and other filming gear. Also, we will need to hire multiple crews to man the cameras, sound, lighting and grips. Computer Generated Images (CGI) will also be need to create the cities to give an authentic look of the 1900s. We will need budget for actors/actresses, wardrobe, make up and hair.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Series:</strong></p>
<p>The series follows a book of witchcraft (The Grimoire) as it's passed on through time and space, leaving a significant impact on all of those who interact with it. In season 1, we meet ""The Grimmies"" (the lead cast) who are given the responsibility to keep the Grimoire safe and use its powers against the dark forces. Well, considering it's a book of ancient sorcery with unknown origins, coveted by many, the Grimmies were bound to come across a few shenanigans. All 12 episodes of season 1, including a prequel short film and a holiday special, were released on Youtube.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558048852/oc0kemhjuvoiugdcqavz.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>For season 2, we expand the Grimoire universe, traveling back and forth through time to explore the untold stories of those who have come across this book and how their lives were forever changed. It's scarier, it's funnier, and it's great entertainment for teens and adults.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Season 2 has already started principle photography!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>Season 1 was about fantasy. Season 2 is where the fantasy meets real life. We've new relatable stories that shine a light on real life issues (social, political, cultural and more), and we need your help to make the magic happen. Each episode this season is a standalone storyline with new actors, new themes and new experiences; it's an anthology of short films that eventually connect one way or another, leading up to a climatic conclusion.</p>
<p>As independent filmmakers, we also want to create collaborative job opportunities for creative people all around the nation.  This series started as a workshop for film students, and has since evolved to an international interactive experience, connecting actors and filmmakers all around the world.</p>
<p>Although the series will still air on our Youtube channel, Sultanic Entertainment, we are hoping to pitch it to a few networks in hopes of getting it picked up (we didn't pitch season 1 because our low budget restricted us from doing everything we hoped to do with production). Either way, we want to hear everyone's thoughts on this new season, and we'd love to continue with a season 3 eventually.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Series:
The series follows a book of witchcraft (The Grimoire) as it's passed on through time and space, leaving a significant impact on all of those who interact with it. In season 1, we meet ""The Grimmies"" (the lead cast) who are given the responsibility to keep the Grimoire safe and use its powers against the dark forces. Well, considering it's a book of ancient sorcery with unknown origins, coveted by many, the Grimmies were bound to come across a few shenanigans. All 12 episodes of season 1, including a prequel short film and a holiday special, were released on Youtube.


For season 2, we expand the Grimoire universe, traveling back and forth through time to explore the untold stories of those who have come across this book and how their lives were forever changed. It's scarier, it's funnier, and it's great entertainment for teens and adults.
Season 2 has already started principle photography!
We get things done, regardless of our budget, and we love the work we do. We would love your help so we can continue filming and deliver something with Great quality!



Our Purpose:
Season 1 was about fantasy. Season 2 is where the fantasy meets real life. We've new relatable stories that shine a light on real life issues (social, political, cultural and more), and we need your help to make the magic happen. Each episode this season is a standalone storyline with new actors, new themes and new experiences; it's an anthology of short films that eventually connect one way or another, leading up to a climatic conclusion.
As independent filmmakers, we also want to create collaborative job opportunities for creative people all around the nation.  This series started as a workshop for film students, and has since evolved to an international interactive experience, connecting actors and filmmakers all around the world.
Although the series will still air on our Youtube channel, Sultanic Entertainment, we are hoping to pitch it to a few networks in hopes of getting it picked up (we didn't pitch season 1 because our low budget restricted us from doing everything we hoped to do with production). Either way, we want to hear everyone's thoughts on this new season, and we'd love to continue with a season 3 eventually.

If, within seven years time, he can turn the seven kingdoms to his side, he will be given dominion over the world. The Adversary stands ready to strike with the powers of Hell ready to do his bidding, but first he must overcome The Trinity.
 Prince Adventures is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17.


Go to https://www.prince-adventures.com/characters to read the bios of Prince Han, Nai, Akil, and Lord Satan!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Tasha Neal-Harris, the Creator and Director and Candace Wright, the Filmmaker, Editor and Co-Director. Together we have over 30 years of experience in writing, theater, acting and 10 years of filmmaking and editing.</p>
<p>We LOVE being creative and expressing all the crazy ideas in our heads! Our latest idea is a youth-driven, creepy comedy web series called The Wicked Imagination of a Teenage Kid! We have already created episode 1 and with your help, we can create the remaining 5 episodes for the first season! With this funding, we can continue to pitch to streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. We can also have more content to pitch to TV networks like TV One, ABC, NBC, TBS and more! We know that working with the youth is more than rewarding and this will provide positive content for our youth!</p>
<h3>What is the Wicked Imagination of a Teenage Kid?</h3>
<p>J.C. is a youngster who has a trait passed down to him. That trait is, that he can't eat before he goes to sleep, or whatever he sees before he goes to sleep, will come to life.......in a CREEPY WAY!  The only way that he and his friends can make the creepy things go away, is to drive them back into his imagination.  They can try to get him back to sleep, but if that doesn't work.....what will they do???  Will his imagination lead to his final bed time story??  Best thing to do is beware, and not let him fall asleep after he eats.......or something may eat you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Episode 1 featured a kid eating teacher....</p>
<p>The episodes we are seeking funding for are;</p>
<p>Episode 2 is the praying mantis - A giant ""praying"" mantis comes to life and captures people and makes them bow down and pray to him. If they don't he will devour them.  How will J.C. and his friends stop the town from all becoming worshiping zombies to a power drunk bug that has a hilarious Arnold Schwarzenegger accent?</p>
<p>Episode 3 - BY DEMAND AND REQUEST.....we have cheerleaders vs vampire zombies....the name says it all.....</p>
<p>Episode 4 - Dentist of doom...............J.C. falls asleep in the dentist office and now his dentist is attacking people with a giant needle</p>
<p>Episode 5 - Animal switch up - What happens when animals have us on the menu?</p>
<p>Episode 6 - (You name an episode you want....if you pick the right perk).</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what are we asking for you say? Well, just 15, 000 to get us started! </p>
<p>We appreciate your consideration and understand how valuable your dollars are! So what will we do with your contribution?</p>

</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will make a dollar stretch! We will still need the above-mentioned items. We created the first episode with no budget, so we know how to work our finances!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You help us help the youth!</p>
<p>We should understand how important the arts are in the world. Without it, we are mindless robots :O! Yes, it's true! We want to continue to inspire more creativity in kids and allow them to express themselves through film!</p>
<p>Going through the first episode, the actors and actresses were so excited and happy on set. They were learning a lot, not only about acting but about teamwork, critical thinking, being confident, pushing past fear and not being afraid to make mistakes. These are lifelong skills they will carry with them through their adult years!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When's the last time you did something brave that had no risk? Right.</p>
<p>We more than understand that the goals and dreams we possess, especially in the entertainment industry will only be accomplished by hard work, long nights and early mornings. We have both been there and done that...several times. Being multiple business owners, parents, students, sisters and more, we know adversity and how to come out on the other side. </p>
<p>We have heard no, have been turned down, have been underestimated through our lives. On the other side, we have had many success, triumphs, and accomplishments when we make it past those challenges. </p>
<p>In order to get this on a network, we may not get Yes right away. So? We keep going. We will find the network that believes in us as much as we do and make it work! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's short and sweet: we got a bunch of amazing actors to help us out while I begin my journey of being a real animator, and not a bump on a log calling myself outrageous nonsense like ""Director"" and ""Executive Producer"". that's right: Keith is finally teaching me how to be useful, and our new show is going to be the centerpiece of that education!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need about $1500 per episode. However, we got episode 1 covered! So this is really for episode 2! This will cover the (currently) nominal salaries of the voice actors, and the acquisition of art assets from my good artist friend, Handerson Soares (we call him ""Oshigan"" around the Studio). I'm doing 80-90% of the assets myself, and I have a background artist queued up on DeviantArt who will assist us further. It's a solid team, but I do not intend to pay myself directly. I hope to get YouTube to handle that part when we finally acquire ""Partner Status"".</li>
<li>Actors include Carey Means (Frylock of ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force""), Sammi Bold, Loran Bolding, Kaylie Horsley, Joelle Aliana Ferguson, Jenna Sharpe, Julie Shields, Keith Wood, and a bevy of guest stars, like my good friend Clare Halstead, Lec Zorn, Shelby Iacometti and many, many more. All of them incredibly skilled actors who are ready to get to work bringing this to life.</li>
<li>

<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Since this is a smaller campaign, contributors will get some fun stuff: shoutouts from our live podcast, mentions in the credits, downloadable PDFs of the scripts and more! Large contributors will receive an ""Associate Producer"" credit.</li>
<li>No matter how much we get, it will go into production, and you'll still get your perks, because they are digital. So no mailing, no hidden costs. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's plain and simple, as I said in the video: I want to learn new skills, but hate the antiseptic environment of a classroom. So Keith is teaching me the needed programs on-the-fly. We already have 1/6 of the first episode completed, and Oshi is busting hump to get me the last assets for a few scenes. But again, 80-90% of this is me. And for YEARS, I've lacked the confidence to do this all on my own. I always felt like an impostor with my art. This is my therapy. And, if I succeed, I can help with production of the vastly more polished and expensive ""Starship Moonhawk"" series so we may actually release more than an episode fragment each year. Seriously, everyone wins here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is simply that I won't have the time or finances to make a 6-10 minute episode every month because I'm scrambling to pay for all of it, and somehow maintain our household on Uber and Lyft and the occasional commissions alone. That would be tragic, because did I mention we are working with CAREY MEANS OF AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE? I shoulda led with that...</p>

<h3>Show Summary</h3>
<p>Sean O’Dell is a white man that grew up heavily influenced by the black culture. His earliest friend exposed him to hip-hop, black-led films, and at times, the struggles of the black community. Sean continued to explore the black culture throughout his life, gaining more insight and understanding from those closest to him. With the help of some of his friends, Seven Da Pantha, Orlando “Sikk” Simmons, and “MrInfoPhilly” Steve Smith, Sean will explore different communities to learn about the struggles, the victories, the pride, and the fear of living as a person of color in the United States.</p>
<p>They will travel the nation, with each season focusing on a different area of the country, to interview experts and discuss past events that have shaped our present, as well as current events that will someday shape our future. Through immersion into the lives of their guests, interviews, and roundtable discussions between their guests and the cast, they will not only learn about events in black culture, but also how they impact the lives of the community.</p>
<p>This series will give an in-depth view into the black culture that no series has ever given before. Not only will it bridge the gap between races, but it will also provide a window to members of the black community to see how their brothers and sisters live across the nation.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact of Your Contribution</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help this show become a reality, but more than that, it will help build understanding and respect across the world. In November, 2020, we shot the first episode of the Cultureless Series, the first short film, Justice For All, recorded the first podcast, and have started filming on episode 2 of the series.</p>
<p>We were honored to be accepted into the Seattle Film Summit where we were placed in the top three of the Pitch Panel Finals. We had the chance to pitch to some truly great minds in the business and were recognized for the concept and spirit of the show.</p>
<p>Cultureless has seen these early successes with absolutely no initial investment. All expenses<br/>have been paid out of pocket by Sean and Seven, as well as the blood, sweat, and dedication of<br/>our cast and crew to make a great show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are just a few of the areas that your contributions will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Costs</li>
<li>Post Production and Editing</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Travel and Expenses</li>
<li>Equipment Rental</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the show being on-going, the necessity of show funding is unlimited. We have, however, determined season 1 to cost approximately $100,000 to ensure we can continue the first season with the same passion and depth that we have given so far. We have started this campaign at $1,000 to ensure we can keep the campaign moving forward with stretch goals. We believe this journey deserves nothing less than our best, and with your contribution, we can provide that.</p>
<p>Your contribution will not go unappreciated. To show our gratitude we have constructed multiple tiers of contribution and the tiers are stacked. This means that if you donate at the third tier contribution, you will also receive the thank you gifts for tiers 1 and 2. </p>
<p>It is important to us that each and every one of our contributors is recognized for their support, so no matter what tier you donate at, your name will be featured in a Special Thanks section in the credits of the final episode. As the tiers go higher you will enjoy access to exclusive content, special live meetings with the cast, exclusive access to an unreleased episode, and even a chance to be a part of the show!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The world is facing two very real threats right now that have a significant impact on the show. The first, a pandemic. Of course, it has effected our ability to shoot new content, but we have not let it stop us. Utilizing video conferencing and social distancing live interview techniques, we have maintained a real and very impactful narrative for the show. We will continue to be creative with our raw shooting style to give the best show we can give.</p>
<p>The second threat that we have faced is the very public and consistent trend of racial injustice in the United States. We would be foolish to think that this would not effect our message. Some fight to burn the bridge that we are attempting to build. The single biggest combatant to this blatant racism is bravery. We will not allow our message to be silenced by the prejudices of others and we will not allow the show the fail.</p>
<p>Our only other challenge is funding. There are so many different aspects to a television show, and we have funded every one of them out-of-pocket thus far. With your help, we will triumph this obstacle as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, we completely understand that. Money is tight for many people and we do not want you to contribute anything that you cannot spare. If you are interested in our project, but cannot contribute monetarily, please consider sharing our campaign with others. Not only will this bring new attention to the campaign, but to the show as well. So, your voice could bring funding to the show and a new level of understanding to your community. To both, we say thank you.<br/> </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For the past 8 months, I’ve been sharing what I’ve learned in 27 years of art study with each of you through my Facebook Live videos.  I’ve been honored and astounded by the reception these videos have received – often with over 3,000 of you tuning in to enjoy the live videos.   It has brought me an incredible amount of joy.  Through the process, I got the idea to develop this into something more, and have collaborated with Emmy-award winning producers to develop a TV show concept called ""Paint Your Adventure.”  The theme of the show will be all about capturing the heart and soul of plein air painting (painting in the outdoors), while exploring adventure and honoring and preserving our nation’s parks and natural areas.  </p>
<p>Recently, I shared that I am a cancer survivor. Getting into the outdoors to paint and explore has had healing and inspirational benefits for me, and I want to share that experience on a broader spectrum.  </p>
<p>In order to make this possible, I’ll need your support.  I’m looking to raise $25,000 to fund a Pilot episode and sizzle reel of “Paint Your Adventure” which we will use to present the concept to distributors… which means that if everyone who has been enjoying my videos donated just $10, we’d easily reach our goal!  </p>
<p>My vision for the full series is about embracing the beauty of nature by plein air painting coupled with the adventure offered at specific locations - from horseback riding in the Rocky Mountains to hiking the Grand Canyon, to kayaking, camping and exploring Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and so on!  It’s part art instruction, part travel, part adventure.</p>
<p>I'd love to raise enough to allow for guests to come along this adventure with me.   Sometimes that guest may be a seasoned professional artist sharing inspiration and conversation, or the guest may be a beginner, ready to explore the joys of painting in the great outdoors for the first time.  I want to encourage others to realize the possibility of discovering a the joy and experience of painting en plein air, and discovering a new adventure that awaits!</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We have two options for filming this Pilot and sizzle. Jeremy Salo, Emmy-winning producer of “Your Brush with Nature” on Netflix has teamed up with me to create this series.  He and his crew are based in Michigan, and for $25,000 we could shoot in the beautiful Great Lakes area, so I set the fundraising goal at $25K.  However, if we are able to raise closer to $50,000, we can film this pilot in Whitefish, Montana at Glacier National Park, which- of course would be nothing short of epic!  I’ll be in Whitefish, Montana this July doing a live painting demo at the Sunti World Art Gallery, and could film in Montana during that time.  We would need the extra funds to cover travel and accommodation costs for the crew, location fees, etc.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I am very excited about this opportunity to bring this to the world and since I am asking you for help, it is not without incentive, so I’m giving my art to top donors to thank them for their help in achieving this goal!</p>
<p>I will be gifting original plein air oil paintings that I have done to top donors:</p>
<p>$500 donated – an original 8"" x 10"" oil painting.</p>
<p>$1,000 donated – an original  ""11 x 14"" oil painting. </p>
<p>$2,000 donated - an original 16"" x 20"" oil painting. </p>
<p>And if you are one of those amazing souls who would like to donate $5,000, I will send you a very large spectacular landscape oil painting, approximately 24’’ x 48.” </p>
<p>All things considered, if everyone that has enjoyed one of my videos gave just $10, it would more than help us get the ball rolling on this fantastic journey.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’ve shared the experience of plein air painting with my 10 year old daughter, and we have created incredible memories together.  As a cancer survivor, I would also love the possibility of offering interested children of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital the opportunity to paint along with me in the restorative ambiance of nature, and feel the joy of creating a painting outside!</p>
<ul>
<li>As a contributor to this project you will be helping this vision of inspiring people to get out and enjoy nature, respect and preserve our nation's natural areas, and find the renewing qualities of capturing a moment with brush and paint in the heart of stunning natural scenery.  </li>
<li>My current instructional videos have been enjoyed thousands of times by viewers and continue to grow in popularity, thus spreading the inspiration and rejuvenating qualities of being surrounded by nature, and keeping the Plein Air Movement thriving and alive.</li>
<li>Join us in creating an inspirational and exciting gateway into the world of outdoor painting and exploration!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have one month to raise the funds, as we aim to shoot this in early summer.  If you feel inspired to share this with your friends who might like to support the arts, please do. </p>

<h2>WHAT IS <i>BROWN</i>?</h2>
<p>We live in a world where marginalized groups are finally getting their time in the sun. Society is changing, and with it our standards. Television is beginning to reflect real life.</p>
<p><i>BROWN</i> is the latest installment of the coming-of-age ensemble comedy, the newest generation of Friends, if they were all sassy, emotionally damaged people of color who are more codependent on their iPhones than they are with each other.</p>
<p>The show follows Omar and Olive, two black siblings in constant competition with one another, and their friends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack, a painfully shy Latinx nerd.</li>
<li>Beau, a Polynesian surfer/stoner and resident Adonis, and,</li>
<li>Daisy: no nonsense, ambiguously Asian, and killing everyone with kindness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they tackle issues of race, identity and sexuality, all while trying to support each other and redefine what it means to really be a family.</p>
<h2>WHY <i>BROWN</i>?</h2>
<p>It seems like everywhere you look now, there’s a show about plucky minorities rearing its head. To some this is overkill. To us? It’s what we deserve. Reparations, if you will, for years of constant exposure to the nuclear family.</p>
<p>For many of the members of the crew, we yearned to see faces that looked like ours when we were growing up. The lack thereof can be supremely damaging to a young mind. BROWN has a way of celebrating the beauty and differences of disparate cultures without making it a huge deal. It’s just life. A little crazy, a little offbeat, and yeah: more than just black and white.</p>
<h2>WHO'S ON DECK?</h2>
<p><strong>OLYVIA SCOTT</strong> is the creator of <i>BROWN</i>, as well as the director and writer of the pilot. She has been working on <i>BROWN</i> since her freshman year of college and is now entering her senior year (whew!).  Olyvia’s favorite character is Beau, but for inexplicable reasons is probably most like Olive.</p>
<p><strong>DANIELLA FERNANDEZ</strong> is the director of photography. A talented, writer, photographer and painter (double whew), Daniella is a proud Gemini and identifies the most with Jack. Since graduating from SCAD in 2017 with a degree in Film &amp; Television, Daniella has been instrumental in the development of BROWN and is eager to bring the characters to life onscreen!</p>
<p><strong>DEONNA GIBBS</strong>, assistant director, Leo. DeOnna studies Dramatic Writing, Photography and Music Composition (triple whew) and is in her senior year as well. She identifies as the female version of Omar and, should the moment arise, is prepared to play him at the drop of a hat. She intends to pursue playwriting after all is said and done, but for now is content in the BROWN writer’s room.</p>
<p><strong>CASSIDY HAYNES </strong>is producer and head gyal in charge. Her boundless energy and optimism is rivaled only by anime heroines, and we are forever grateful to be harnessing a human Energizer bunny on this project. Haynes is studying Dramatic Writing like DeOnna, is a proud Libra (as is Olyvia), and loves every character to death. (Olive is her favorite despite the fact that she refuses to choose.)</p>
<h2>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h2>
<p><i>BROWN</i> is being funded independently. Like our charming band of characters, the creators of the show are broke twentysomethings that just need a little help from their friends.</p>
<p><strong>The ultimate goal is $3,000</strong>. And that’s quite a bit on paper. But as this is a passion project years in the making, we want it done right. However, this is a flexible goal. We have already raised $1K with our first campaign and we know we can do it again, if not more.</p>
<p><strong>$500 will get our foot in the door.</strong><br/>This will get us enough to film a quick proof of concept, one that we can feel good about showing. With $1K, all backers will receive their perks and we’ll be able to give you all a taste of the characters and the show as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>$1,5000 will get us halfway there!</strong><br/>$2.5K can help us shoot and edit approximately half of the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>$3,000? Say no more.</strong><br/>With our full budget, the creators of BROWN can produce a fully fleshed out pilot, one that we can send to festivals and present to production companies. Production will start in the fall and the final cut will be released in 2019.</p>
<h2>WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING?</h2>
<p>The money we raise will go 100% towards the execution of BROWN. But since we’re perfectionists, here’s a breakdown of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Locations:</strong> It all starts somewhere!</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Design: </strong>Costumes, make-up, props, and set dress are important elements in their own right. We want to make sure our cast and the locations look their best.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment:</strong> Cameras, lighting, and sound are going to be imperative to making this pilot the best it can be.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food, food, food:</strong> We’ve all got mouths to feed. And for our full days on set, we want to make sure that our cast and crew are happy and healthy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post and Promo:</strong> Even after the cameras stop rolling, we’ve got footage to edit and a film to promote! This will help us polish the final cut and send it on its way when we’re finished. (This also includes the perks we’ll be sending out *gasp* TO YOU!)</li>
<li><strong>Accidentals, artistic promotion and miscellaneous needs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Those Indiegogo fees!</strong></li>

<p><i>(Version française plus bas)</i></p>
<h2><strong>Welcome to the Web-Serie “The Mortals”! ⚔</strong></h2>
<p>First of all, let’s introduce ourselves: we are AC Powers, an emerging media team preparing the first season of a dramatic web-series set in a medieval-fantasy context. We are young, passionate and dynamic filmmakers who have been working in the arts for several years now, and we are now embarking on our most daring venture yet! </p> <h3>Synopsis ☠</h3>
<p>While we want to keep it as surprising as possible, story-wise, here’s a brief idea of what will the series look like :</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As clashes between humans and orcs escalate, Clara joins the Alliance forces to help her nation fend off the tribal forces that are advancing further into their territory. Faced with a reality where magic, orcs, and paladins are real, her training as a militiaman will be put to the test as she discovers a war where good and evil no longer seem so distinct. </p> <p>We have already produced a pilot to give you an idea of the seriousness of the project: cinematographic quality, beautiful costumes and makeup, original soundtrack, exciting choreography ... While keeping the main plot of the scenario yours to discover once the project is released ;) </p> <h3>Ambitions</h3>
<p>Compared to what we see being produced on the Quebec film scene in normal times, this is a rather singular project! Initially, we are planning a free online distribution, while aiming to send the project to festivals (like Fantasia) and to different distribution companies, to potentially succeed in unlocking a budget for a second season. One could say that season 1 itself is like a pilot project!</p> <h3>What you contribute...</h3>
<p>That's where you come in! A project like this requires a lot of resources and we need help. Fortunately, our dedicated volunteer team believes in the project and is willing to invest in it despite the lack of budget. Also, we are fortunate to already be working with some great partners and have been able to accumulate some resources over time. However, some expenses cannot be avoided...</p> <p>Any money you give us will go directly into the expenses of the production: feeding the crew, making the costumes, providing the make-up, covering the transportation costs... The more you contribute, the more we will be able to offer you a truly EPIC series!</p> <p> </p> <h3>... What you collect!</h3>
<p>The first big reward, for you as well as for us, will be that we will all have in our hands a complete first season of the web-series to entertain us all and make us dream! But of course, this one goes without saying ;)</p>
<p>Then, depending on the nature or weight of your contribution, interesting rewards are planned! </p>
<p>These can be exclusive content, early access to the season... </p>
<p>Personalized thanks, a place in the credits...</p>
<p>Exclusive merchandise, even unique items used during the shooting!</p>
<p>We are still talking with our partners to see what other unique options we can offer you! Many more options are on their way! </p> <h3>The challenges</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that a project like this has its share of challenges, but we are resourceful! We intend to complete the project no matter what, but the unexpected and lack of resources are always obvious obstacles in projects like this. </p>
<p>Things may change or deadlines may be pushed back, but in any case, we will work hard to adapt. Our experience on similar projects over the years equips us to handle such obstacles.</p>
<p>And... The higher the waves, the better the story to tell when we get to the harbor!</p>
<p>In the end, the more support we receive from you, the more these unforeseen events can be avoided and the more the project will keep its original nature!</p> <h3>Partners</h3>
<p>By the way, as we were talking about challenges, we are not alone in this adventure! Several partners, each as devoted as the other, have already shown their interest and are ready to help in their own way to make this dream a reality! In particular...</p> <p>“<strong>Calimacil</strong>” who equip us with spectacular custom weapons!</p>
<p>""<strong>Les Terres de Bélénos</strong>"", who are lending a hand by allowing the series to be created on their domain!</p>
<p>“<strong>Les Forges de Chek</strong>”, who provide amazing costumes, armors, and orc scenery!</p>
<p>“<strong>Les ateliers du Lys d’Or</strong>”, who devote their talents to outfitting our soldiers with handmade costumes!</p>
<p>“<strong>Les Forges d'Arcalion</strong>”, who is busy arming our soldiers for the battlefield!</p>
<p><strong>Farya Faraji</strong>, who composes a completely original musical score and gives the project a unique melodic soul.</p>
<p><strong>Adrenaline Stunts</strong>, who lends its expertise to ensure breathtaking battles!</p>
<p>“<strong>Atelier du Loisir</strong>” who helped the project to be born by allowing the pilot episode to be held on their land! </p> <p>So, why not join us as our partners have already done? :D</p> <h3>SHARE!</h3>
<p>Any type of help you are willing to provide will be appreciated! We realize that some may not be able to contribute monetarily, but for those who are able to do so, to whatever degree, we say a HUGE THANK YOU!!! </p>
<p>Otherwise, for those of you who are looking for ways to help in other ways, already by sharing our campaign, you will be helping tons to make a great difference and really help this project come to life!</p> <p>Stay tuned! We will give you more news soon ;) </p> <h3>THANK YOU!</h3>

<h2>Bienvenue à la web-série “Les mortels”! ⚔</h2>
<p>Tout d’abord, permettez-moi de nous présenter : nous sommes AC Powers, une équipe émergente qui prépare la première saison d’une web-série dramatique se situant dans un contexte médiéval-fantastique. Nous sommes de jeunes cinéastes passionnés et dynamiques qui œuvrent dans le domaine artistique depuis plusieurs années déjà, et nous amorçons maintenants notre aventure la plus audacieuse à ce jour! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Synopsis ☠</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Bien qu’on souhaite garder la surprise le plus possible, côté histoire, la série aura l’air de quoi?Juste pour donner une idée, voici un court aperçu :</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Alors que les affrontements se multiplient entre les humains et les orcs, Clara joint les forces de l’Alliance afin d’aider sa nation à repousser les forces tribales qui avancent de plus en plus sur leur territoire. Confrontée à une réalité où magie, orcs et paladins sont bien réels, son entraînement de milicienne sera mis à rude épreuve alors qu’elle découvrira une guerre où le bien et le mal ne semblent plus si distincts. </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p>Nous avons déjà produit un pilote visant à vous donner une idée du sérieux du projet : qualité cinématographique, beauté des costumes et maquillages, trame sonore originale, chorégraphies palpitantes … Tout en gardant l'intrigue principale du scénario à découvrir lors de la sortie du projet! ;) </p>

Welcome to the Web-Serie “The Mortals”! ⚔
First of all, let’s introduce ourselves: we are AC Powers, an emerging media team preparing the first season of a dramatic web-series set in a medieval-fantasy context. We are young, passionate and dynamic filmmakers who have been working in the arts for several years now, and we are now embarking on our most daring venture yet!  Synopsis ☠
While we want to keep it as surprising as possible, story-wise, here’s a brief idea of what will the series look like :
As clashes between humans and orcs escalate, Clara joins the Alliance forces to help her nation fend off the tribal forces that are advancing further into their territory. Faced with a reality where magic, orcs, and paladins are real, her training as a militiaman will be put to the test as she discovers a war where good and evil no longer seem so distinct.  We have already produced a pilot to give you an idea of the seriousness of the project: cinematographic quality, beautiful costumes and makeup, original soundtrack, exciting choreography ... While keeping the main plot of the scenario yours to discover once the project is released ;)  Ambitions
Compared to what we see being produced on the Quebec film scene in normal times, this is a rather singular project! Initially, we are planning a free online distribution, while aiming to send the project to festivals (like Fantasia) and to different distribution companies, to potentially succeed in unlocking a budget for a second season. One could say that season 1 itself is like a pilot project! What you contribute...
That's where you come in! A project like this requires a lot of resources and we need help. Fortunately, our dedicated volunteer team believes in the project and is willing to invest in it despite the lack of budget. Also, we are fortunate to already be working with some great partners and have been able to accumulate some resources over time. However, some expenses cannot be avoided... Any money you give us will go directly into the expenses of the production: feeding the crew, making the costumes, providing the make-up, covering the transportation costs... The more you contribute, the more we will be able to offer you a truly EPIC series!   ... What you collect!
The first big reward, for you as well as for us, will be that we will all have in our hands a complete first season of the web-series to entertain us all and make us dream! But of course, this one goes without saying ;)
Then, depending on the nature or weight of your contribution, interesting rewards are planned! 
These can be exclusive content, early access to the season... 
Personalized thanks, a place in the credits...
Exclusive merchandise, even unique items used during the shooting!
We are still talking with our partners to see what other unique options we can offer you! Many more options are on their way!  The challenges
It goes without saying that a project like this has its share of challenges, but we are resourceful! We intend to complete the project no matter what, but the unexpected and lack of resources are always obvious obstacles in projects like this. 
Things may change or deadlines may be pushed back, but in any case, we will work hard to adapt. Our experience on similar projects over the years equips us to handle such obstacles.
And... The higher the waves, the better the story to tell when we get to the harbor!
In the end, the more support we receive from you, the more these unforeseen events can be avoided and the more the project will keep its original nature! Partners
By the way, as we were talking about challenges, we are not alone in this adventure! Several partners, each as devoted as the other, have already shown their interest and are ready to help in their own way to make this dream a reality! In particular... “Calimacil” who equip us with spectacular custom weapons!
""Les Terres de Bélénos"", who are lending a hand by allowing the series to be created on their domain!
“Les Forges de Chek”, who provide amazing costumes, armors, and orc scenery!
“Les ateliers du Lys d’Or”, who devote their talents to outfitting our soldiers with handmade costumes!
“Les Forges d'Arcalion”, who is busy arming our soldiers for the battlefield!
Farya Faraji, who composes a completely original musical score and gives the project a unique melodic soul.
Adrenaline Stunts, who lends its expertise to ensure breathtaking battles!
“Atelier du Loisir” who helped the project to be born by allowing the pilot episode to be held on their land!  So, why not join us as our partners have already done? :D SHARE!
Any type of help you are willing to provide will be appreciated! We realize that some may not be able to contribute monetarily, but for those who are able to do so, to whatever degree, we say a HUGE THANK YOU!!! 
Otherwise, for those of you who are looking for ways to help in other ways, already by sharing our campaign, you will be helping tons to make a great difference and really help this project come to life! Stay tuned! We will give you more news soon ;)  THANK YOU!
 
 
Bienvenue à la web-série “Les mortels”! ⚔
Tout d’abord, permettez-moi de nous présenter : nous sommes AC Powers, une équipe émergente qui prépare la première saison d’une web-série dramatique se situant dans un contexte médiéval-fantastique. Nous sommes de jeunes cinéastes passionnés et dynamiques qui œuvrent dans le domaine artistique depuis plusieurs années déjà, et nous amorçons maintenants notre aventure la plus audacieuse à ce jour! 
 
Synopsis ☠

Bien qu’on souhaite garder la surprise le plus possible, côté histoire, la série aura l’air de quoi?Juste pour donner une idée, voici un court aperçu :
Alors que les affrontements se multiplient entre les humains et les orcs, Clara joint les forces de l’Alliance afin d’aider sa nation à repousser les forces tribales qui avancent de plus en plus sur leur territoire. Confrontée à une réalité où magie, orcs et paladins sont bien réels, son entraînement de milicienne sera mis à rude épreuve alors qu’elle découvrira une guerre où le bien et le mal ne semblent plus si distincts. 
 
Nous avons déjà produit un pilote visant à vous donner une idée du sérieux du projet : qualité cinématographique, beauté des costumes et maquillages, trame sonore originale, chorégraphies palpitantes … Tout en gardant l'intrigue principale du scénario à découvrir lors de la sortie du projet! ;) 
 
Ambitions
Si on compare à ce qu’on voit se faire produire sur la scène cinématographique québécoise en temps normal, il s’agit d’un projet assez singulier! Initialement, nous planifions une distribution gratuite en ligne, tout en visant d'envoyer le projet dans des festivals (comme Fantasia) et à différentes boîtes de production, pour potentiellement réussir à débloquer un budget pour une saison 2.

Celles-ci peuvent être du contenu exclusif, un accès anticipé à la saison...

The fights eventually turned to death matches.  That opened the way for Oni to kill and torture for profit. Antonio believes that when Oni takes his preferred drug cocktail, he gets advice from demons from the spiritual realm.  The cocktail gives him extraordinary focus, memory, and heightened senses.  Oni will track for a week without sleeping, relentlessly chasing his target.  Do NOT fall asleep!<br/><br/><strong>Poppa Skrilla</strong> works with Antonio's business side.

WELCOME BACK!
You just witnessed the pilot episode of Juarez VR and YOU SURVIVED! But you have questions. Who is Detective Juarez? Where the heck did that big knife come from? Did anyone break a hip? We can answer all of that and more, but first we need your help.
We are pioneers in the world of  3D VR filmmaking, and we want to bring you in on the action. By placing you right in the middle of the scene, we give you a unique, intense ACTION experience like you’ve never seen before! And we want to continue dropping you straight into the action by bringing you all new, high stakes episodes.
We will dig into the backgrounds of our main characters, develop new ones, and throw in some surprises. Our goal is to bring you a cutting-edge, virtual reality 3D experience.  To keep this adventure going, we need to raise $50,000 to film episode 2 where we develop Juarez's character.
We will be using the funds raised to create more episodes, pay our crew, purchase and/or rent quality 360 degree video and sound equipment, and upgrade post-production technology. We want YOU to see jaw dropping stunts in amazing locations.
We want to scale up production and give you more of everything. We have a team of experienced martial artists and stunt coordinators ready to keep this project going.
Let's create more special-effects, more fight scenes, more flying bullets, more blood splattering, and more ACTION!

Discover the Characters
  Detective Juarez, a former US Air Force Combat Controller, was discharged after an incident in a forward operating base near Balad Air Base, Iraq that took the life of a USAF Commander, and hundreds of insurgents.  He makes a living seeking retribution. There are few in the world that know his name and have access to his skills.Nissa is a hand-to-hand combat, fighting machine. Her father, a  PSIA, Second Intelligence 
Department Operative trained Nissa from an early age.  Nissa's skills continued to develop in Venezuela, South America where it was necessary for her to seek justice following a life of activism. 
Antonio “The Boss” is a man seeking absolute power.  His desires initially led him to run for political office.  He was a known, ruthless, isolationist politician. Antonio eventually realized that hiding his greed behind politics was unnecessary.  The nightclub is just one of his many ventures. He has a hand in every dark corner of the underworld, but his favorite commodity is human trafficking which makes him Juarez’s number one target.Sophia is a college graduate torn away from her family. Her unexpected disappearance left her powerful parents in shock.  Their daughter was never supposed to be one of those who go missing when they go walk their dog.Oni is Antonio’s go to torturer and assassin. Oni grew up an orphan, surviving by winning MMA bouts before he turned 9-years old.  He started taking drugs during teenage years to improve his training and chances of winning fights. The fights eventually turned to death matches.  That opened the way for Oni to kill and torture for profit. Antonio believes that when Oni takes his preferred drug cocktail, he gets advice from demons from the spiritual realm.  The cocktail gives him extraordinary focus, memory, and heightened senses.  Oni will track for a week without sleeping, relentlessly chasing his target.  Do NOT fall asleep!Poppa Skrilla works with Antonio's business side. He’s tech-savvy, adept at using cryptocurrency, foreign bank accounts, and international business licenses.  Skrilla developed what he believes is a successful winning business model that Antonio named HGL: Ho’s, Gun’s, and Liquor.
Thank you for watching!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hidden Thorns is a fan production and a labor of love. Our cast and crew is made up entirely of amateurs, united by our love of SiX, the Queens, and feminism. Meet the crew!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hania: Hey, I’m one of the co-creators and writers. I am a massive history nerd and listen to way too many musicals in my spare time.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam: Salutations, all—I’m one of our writers, and our pseudo-expert on all things YouTube (I run my own channel, La Femme Fictionale).</p></li>
<li><p>Rachel: Hi! I’m the woman responsible for casting our Queens and making sure this campaign is put together smoothly, with the help of Hania and Sam for the latter. I also write for the show.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $250 USD for editing software costs and $50 USD for props. We also need emergency money if there are any hurdles that arise. All leftover money will be split among our crew to compensate for our hard work. Perks include bonus episodes, your name in the thank you section of our credits, and episodes early.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We would never dream of measuring up to SiX, but we know how expensive theatre tickets can be, and how far away productions are for a lot of fans. It’s our hope that we can give our fellow fans something they can enjoy and share with others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, not receiving enough funds to get the proper editing software and other material/props for the show is our biggest challenge. We still plan on releasing the show regardless of whether or not we meet our goal. As for risks, filming troubles for the cast is one (thankfully, understudies were also cast). Another risk we may come across is copyright claims. The original inspiration for this project was SiX the musical, and though Hidden Thorns is very different, some of our episode titles are inspired by the musical.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

With no disaster relief in sight, more displaced animals than ever and a shrinking dog food supply, Leo rose to the occasion and demonstrated true heroism.

<h3>Show Summary</h3>
<p><i>What's Moped Money?</i></p>
<p>Moped Money is a first-of-its-kind competition, where two teams each get one busted moped, $500, and 24 hours to build the fastest, best looking bike they can on a shoestring budget. The winners keep the moped and score some cash. The losers walk home.</p>
<p><i>Why mopeds?</i></p>
<p>They're not talked about a whole lot, but they should be. Mopeds are intriguing for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First off, science: As far as modes of transportation go, mopeds are insanely fuel efficient. And because of their simple design, people who have no mechanical background can very quickly learn the basics of how a motor works. </p>
<p>If you're not a builder, they're still a sight for sore eyes. These relics are unlike most other vehicles, and are sure to turn heads wherever they pop up. Some people may call them antiques or novelties, but for moped clubs across the US, it's a way of life. </p>
<p>But if all that's not enough, most first time riders find them exhilirating, and can't shake the smile from their face. So if they were to get one for themselves, they could do so and totally trick it out at a very reasonable price point. <br/><br/>When you pair the educational aspects with the rich character of the club culture, you've got a subject that is exciting, entertaining, and educational all at the same time. If we're being honest, it's shocking to us that there hasn't been a show quite like this yet.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise the funds so that we can make a second episode of this show. Doing so proves that this concept has traction past the pilot. It also gives us another opportunity to gain enough exposure to potentially get picked up by a network, whether that be on television or as a streaming web series. This episode needs to be able to stand toe-to-toe with any of the other build-off style shows that you might see on TV.  In order to do this the right way, we need to get better cameras, more crew, and new contestants that can be properly compensated.<br/><br/>In short, your contribution to our crowdfunding efforts are essential to making this a reality. However, as much as money plays a part, we're also looking to get a vote of support from the community. If you've got a friend or relative in the entertainment industry that owes you a favor, let them know that putting this show on air would settle your outstanding debts. (Or, you know, just say that it'd be really cool if they could pull a few strings.)<br/><br/>Your contribution will not go unnoticed. No matter how much we raise through this campaign, we're still making another episode. The question is, are you going to help make it better?</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Learn with Lee Season 2 needs YOU! Help us reach our next goal. Your support will help us expand production, reach young learners and create more interactive learning tools for creative young minds.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT Learn with Lee</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Lee. I am an author, kidpreneur and motivational speaker. I make videos about the places I go and things I do so other kids can learn about them too. I wrote a book called <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/109031678X"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trucks That Help</a> so kids like me can know what trucks do</p>
<p>to help us everyday. On my website, kids can play games and do activities. </p>
<p> If you haven't already seen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/learnwithlee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Season 1</a> you can check it out at <a href=""https://LearnWithLee.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LearnWithLee.org</a>. </p> <p>What is Learn with Lee? Learn with Lee is taking a creative approach to educating and</p>
<p>inspiring the community. Using social media platforms such as Youtube and Facebook we are encouraging constructive online and offline time. With math, reading and physical activities. Each video has a related activity with the goal of enhancing reading, math and comprehension abilities while exploring the community and meeting new people.</p> <p>Before starting season 1, my Dad closed his photography studio to focus on his health. While around the house YouTube kids played non stop all day. We saw lots of kids my age selling toys. We took a homeschool approach to creating a full learning platform that can grow with me and help other kids too.   </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE'RE RAISING FUNDS</strong></p>
<p>We had such an amazing response from our families, friends, friends of friends...so we want to involve you! All donations to this campaign will go toward expanding the production, products, and reaching more kids. It should go without saying that filmmaking is expensive, so we need some help. </p>
<p><strong>Your donation will go toward:</strong></p>
<p>Production cost and Additional Equipment - The current equipment is getting the job done, age and the continuous use are taking its toll and will need maintenance.</p>
<p>Website, Graphics and Music Licences - Keeping active minds engaged is a large task and requires a lot of resources.   </p>
<p>Marketing - We have to let people know how to find us. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF YOU EXCEED YOUR GOAL?</strong></p>
<p>Our current goal is set to about 50% of the show's total budget. There's so much more that needs to be paid for. If we go over and above our goal your contribution will help secure the following:</p>
<p>Lee’s Salary - I need food and toys! My dad is also making me save for college or investing in other businesses when I get older. </p>
<p>Community Outreach - Reading my book in daycares and preschools is fun for me and my new friends. Leaving them with coloring pages and awesome giveaways makes it even better.</p>
<p>Vendor Opportunities - I love going to new places to meet new people sometimes they charge to set up. Even if people can’t purchase things I like giving them stickers and handouts.   </p>
<p>Editing - With the amount of time my dad puts into this he probably should get a paycheck too. </p>
<p>Graphics - Developing the video content, marketing, products, website tools and workbooks require a lot of time and money.</p>
<p>Wardrobe and Props - Telling these stories are so much more fun when I can dress up. You should see when I got to dress up like a <a href=""https://youtu.be/DIgLXRPFq_Y?t=87"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fireman</a>. </p>
<p><strong>A SINCERE THANK YOU</strong> </p>
<p>Asking for a monetary donation is not something easy to do. Thank you for supporting Learn with Lee. Money is great but even watching Season 1 over-and-over again to get our view counts up on youtube will be greatly appreciated. </p> <p><strong>UNABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AT THIS TIME? </strong></p>

This new company will initially stream on Twitch only in the Always On category. Here are a list of reasons why I'm trying to do this:</p><ol>
<li>Reach as many people with the <i>Good News of Jesus Christ (<strong>6+ bil gamers/15+ Mil per month on Twitch</strong>)</i>
</li>
<li>Bring together multiple Christian streamers of different denominations to demonstrate <u>unity in faith</u>
</li>
<li>Create a <strong>centralized</strong> location where 24/7 Christian variety content is being played</li>
<li>Provide a <u>family friendly</u> space where you and your children can watch safe and entertaining content</li>
</ol><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547347363/v87w33wvkwc1rdabxm3b.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>What Results Look Like:</h3><ol>
<li>Saving many <strong>lives</strong> and winning them for God!</li>
<li>Streamers and churches of <i>multiple points</i> of views (Calvinism, Arminianism, Baptist, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, etc) providing content for the channel</li>
<li>
<u>Eliminate</u> the need to hunt down and find Christian streamers due to the creation of this channel</li>
<li>Ability to watch the channel <i>worry free</i>, knowing the content is <strong>wholesome</strong>
</li>
</ol><h3>What We Are Offering:</h3><p>Through this Indiegogo campaign, we are offering opportunities to advertise on our channel, future website, and social media. In exchange for your generous donation, we are offering the following:</p><ul>
<li>$100 - Gets your name on a public thank you page</li>
<li>$200 - Gets you a verbal shout out on air which will later be uploaded to our Youtube page</li>
<li>$500 - Gets your qualifying business's logo on the screen for 14 hours a week for the first month</li>
<li>$500 - Gets your church's sermon on twice a week for the first month</li>
<li>$750 - Gets your 1:30 or less video on air live to sponsor 2 hours every day (played at a 15 minute interval) for the first month</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547361174/zjz3yfktfrpffff7dymu.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Where the money will go:</h3><p>This campaign is set up to cover the following costs: </p><ol>
<li>My salary</li>
<li>Minimum start up costs<ol>
<li>LLC creation</li>
<li>Trademark The King's Entertainment and/or Turtle Bytes Show</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Optional Business Enhancing Costs (if we exceed funding goal):<ol>
<li>My salary for a 2nd month or more</li>
<li>2nd computer for redundancy and video editing purposes</li>
<li>Social media paid marketing ads</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol><h3>The risks:</h3><p>If this campaign is successful, then the minimum costs will be covered. To keep the company operational, I would attempt to raise revenues (money) through the following means:</p><ol>
<li>Reach out to local churches for sponsorship</li>
<li>Subscriptions to the channel</li>
<li>Tips/Donations to the channel</li>
<li>Cheers (Twitch currency) to the channel</li>
<li>Merch purchases through the channel</li>
</ol><p>The main foreseeable risk is revenue generation. The monthly costs to operate this business is going to be a minimum of $4000. If I'm unable to generate another $4000 by the end of February, then I will be faced with the following options:</p><ol>
<li>Attempt to do another round of fundraising to raise $4000 again (first week of March).</li>
<li>If the money raised is between $2000-$4000, then I may be able to continue operations by getting a part time job. If this happens, then the quality of channel may go down. </li>
<li>If the money raised is less than $2000, then I will have to temporarily or permanently cease business operation and get full time employment</li>
</ol><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547362523/gwmr7ztqrzwflcsy28bf.png"" src=""""/></p><p>You and I have an opportunity to do something really great. As far as I know, there is no other company like this one we're trying to create. Many lives could be won over for God by this channel. I have a road map on how to make this successful (including budgetary wise). Please pray before you consider giving. I want this to 100% spirit lead and it has to be if it's going to be successful. Your contributions will not go through unless we reach 100%+ funding.

This decision represents a big step in my life and I need your help!Campaign Goal:Our goal with the campaign is to raise enough money to provide initial funding to start The King's Entertainment, a Christian broadcasting company. This new company will initially stream on Twitch only in the Always On category. Here are a list of reasons why I'm trying to do this:
Reach as many people with the Good News of Jesus Christ (6+ bil gamers/15+ Mil per month on Twitch)

Bring together multiple Christian streamers of different denominations to demonstrate unity in faith

Create a centralized location where 24/7 Christian variety content is being played
Provide a family friendly space where you and your children can watch safe and entertaining content
What Results Look Like:
Saving many lives and winning them for God!
Streamers and churches of multiple points of views (Calvinism, Arminianism, Baptist, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, etc) providing content for the channel

Eliminate the need to hunt down and find Christian streamers due to the creation of this channel
Ability to watch the channel worry free, knowing the content is wholesome

What We Are Offering:Through this Indiegogo campaign, we are offering opportunities to advertise on our channel, future website, and social media. In exchange for your generous donation, we are offering the following:
$100 - Gets your name on a public thank you page
$200 - Gets you a verbal shout out on air which will later be uploaded to our Youtube page
$500 - Gets your qualifying business's logo on the screen for 14 hours a week for the first month
$500 - Gets your church's sermon on twice a week for the first month
$750 - Gets your 1:30 or less video on air live to sponsor 2 hours every day (played at a 15 minute interval) for the first month
Where the money will go:This campaign is set up to cover the following costs: 
My salary
Minimum start up costs
LLC creation
Trademark The King's Entertainment and/or Turtle Bytes Show


Optional Business Enhancing Costs (if we exceed funding goal):
My salary for a 2nd month or more
2nd computer for redundancy and video editing purposes
Social media paid marketing ads


The risks:If this campaign is successful, then the minimum costs will be covered. To keep the company operational, I would attempt to raise revenues (money) through the following means:
Reach out to local churches for sponsorship
Subscriptions to the channel
Tips/Donations to the channel
Cheers (Twitch currency) to the channel
Merch purchases through the channel
The main foreseeable risk is revenue generation. The monthly costs to operate this business is going to be a minimum of $4000. If I'm unable to generate another $4000 by the end of February, then I will be faced with the following options:
Attempt to do another round of fundraising to raise $4000 again (first week of March).
If the money raised is between $2000-$4000, then I may be able to continue operations by getting a part time job. If this happens, then the quality of channel may go down. 
If the money raised is less than $2000, then I will have to temporarily or permanently cease business operation and get full time employment
You and I have an opportunity to do something really great. As far as I know, there is no other company like this one we're trying to create. Many lives could be won over for God by this channel. I have a road map on how to make this successful (including budgetary wise). Please pray before you consider giving. I want this to 100% spirit lead and it has to be if it's going to be successful. Your contributions will not go through unless we reach 100%+ funding. Thank you all and God bless you!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>   Hi.  Thanks for your support!  Would you like to see more episodes on a regular basis ?  I've been thanked from several individuals that I don't know personally, for making the first two episodes.   My videos have helped other substitute teachers fight for better benefits and pay from their districts.  </p>
<p>        Substitute Teachers are not just glorified babysitters.  We have to deal with many issues in the classrooms and some people do this for a living.   Babysitters watch babies and young children.   Do they deal with similar classroom issues as teachers also?</p>
<p>      We are responsible for continuing the education of children and teens from K - 12, in the absence of their instructors.  That's why we are given lesson plans.  Some districts require that you have a bachelor's degree and pass a state exam to work in their classrooms.  </p>
<p>       Are babysitters required to do that?  Also many of us deal with unruly students and staff members sometimes.   People seem to dismiss what we do.  But if you were to ask the average adult would they do this job, they would say ""NO!!!!!! especially  parents.  </p>

<p>      I can also pick an actor to play your character if these funds are raised publicly not out of my pockets.   So if you have great material, let me know.</p>
<p>       If I can receive at least $5 from each fan a month,  I can produce a new episode every 3 months. Each episode costs about $2,000 to shoot with an ultra low, low,low budget production company.   I've done this before and our second episode turned out great.</p>
<p>       I can cast you for a small role if you donate $200 or more and If you are an actor who lives or is financial fit to travel to where a future episode will be shot.    Or I can travel to your area to shoot an episode if adequate financial resources have been raised and is available to use there.   So this can be a win, win for many. </p>
<p>       Interested?  Let me know.  And donate $5 if you like.  The last few episodes were out of my pockets.   And it's becoming increasingly difficult to continue this trend.  I would like to pay reliable actors also. The prior episodes were shot with volunteer actors who are struggling to fulfill their dreams.   So please donate whatever you can.  And spread the word to other substitute teachers.

<p>Welcome to the official pitch for the new live game show that will take Pittsburgh by storm... Ready, Set, Geek!</p>
<p>Ready, Set, Geek! Is a weekly live show that pits 3 contestants against one another and combines knowledge, passion, persuasive argument, comedy while delving into geek and pop culture.  </p>
<p>Ready, Set, Geek will be a live audience show that will be held every Thursday at our home base, New Dimension Comics in Century III Mall that will also be streamed on facebook, Twitch, recorded for our YouTube channel, and for an audio podcast. </p>
<p><u><strong>FORMAT:</strong></u> The show will run a hour long with 3 different styles of play. 3 contestants will brave through 5 rounds of competition to win a grand prize. After 4 rounds, the contestant with the lowest score will be eliminated and the final 2 will head to the last round. The winner will be the person standing with the highest total points.  </p>
<p><strong>THE PITCH OFF: </strong>The three contestants will be given a sealed envelope with an actor, a location or object, and a fictional title. From this list they must create a movie pitch to give the host. Whomever has the best and most entertaining pitch will be given the first point and control of the board. </p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE CONTROL:</strong> This is the real star of the show. The contestant with control of the board will choose one of the three topics provided by the host. Each contestant will choose their own answer based on the topic picked. Each contestant will be given an opening argument to defend their answer before the topic becomes open for discussion. The host will ask further questions, pursue different avenues, until final arguments are called. The host will then make the choice on which contestant provided the best argument. The winner will control the next topic and the format continues. There will be runtimes of opening statements of 60 seconds, 90 seconds rebuttals, 60 seconds closing.  </p>
<p><strong>BOSS BATTLE:</strong> At the end of the Creative Control, 1 contestant has been eliminated and the two final competitors are set against one another. They will be tasked with answering 10 questions in a rapid fire format. Each question asked will have been polled by a group of people and each polled answer has one point assigned to it. (Think Family Feud point system). Whichever contestant garners the highest total at the end of the Boss Battle will be crowned the Winner.  </p>
<p><u><strong>SO WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</strong></u> Our short term goals are to create a new entertainment market in Pittsburgh and build brand awareness. We would like to have a commitment to run for at least 6 months to work out details while creating a fanbase and audience for the show. We want to have a strong social media presence along with being able to tap into the market for genre fans that we are targeting. Long term, the continued growth will open the door for further sponsors and endorsements to make the show even more economically viable with production while continuing development and growth as a brand.</p>
<p><u><strong>ANYTHING ELSE?</strong></u> Not really, we believe that the Pittsburgh market is one that has a lot of opportunity and being able to provide entertainment for a hour a week working within the parameters that we have laid out can fill a very specific void. We want to be able to draw both fans, friends, comedians, and guests into our show and see just exactly how far we can go. </p>

The host will ask further questions, pursue different avenues, until final arguments are called. The host will then make the choice on which contestant provided the best argument. The winner will control the next topic and the format continues. There will be runtimes of opening statements of 60 seconds, 90 seconds rebuttals, 60 seconds closing.  
BOSS BATTLE: At the end of the Creative Control, 1 contestant has been eliminated and the two final competitors are set against one another. They will be tasked with answering 10 questions in a rapid fire format. Each question asked will have been polled by a group of people and each polled answer has one point assigned to it. (Think Family Feud point system). Whichever contestant garners the highest total at the end of the Boss Battle will be crowned the Winner.  
SO WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? Our short term goals are to create a new entertainment market in Pittsburgh and build brand awareness. We would like to have a commitment to run for at least 6 months to work out details while creating a fanbase and audience for the show. We want to have a strong social media presence along with being able to tap into the market for genre fans that we are targeting. Long term, the continued growth will open the door for further sponsors and endorsements to make the show even more economically viable with production while continuing development and growth as a brand.
ANYTHING ELSE? Not really, we believe that the Pittsburgh market is one that has a lot of opportunity and being able to provide entertainment for a hour a week working within the parameters that we have laid out can fill a very specific void. We want to be able to draw both fans, friends, comedians, and guests into our show and see just exactly how far we can go.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>EVERYONE WANTS TO STIFLE CREATIVITY. WE EMBRACE AND PROMOTE IT.</h3>
<p>I'm Michael Canter and I am the founder of Jivewired TV. We've come quite a long way since very humble beginnings, and unfortunately, recently lost investment money that we were counting on receiving. Know this, we want to make this as simple as possible and ideally, if we can find 250,000 people to donate a single dollar we can move forward without worrying about outside investors. Think of it this way, for a one time donation of ONE DOLLAR you can access thousands of hours of great content - for free -  using an Apple, Roku or Amazon Fire device, on your iOS or Android devices, or by simply going to the website we are developing at <a href=""http://jivewired.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jivewired.tv</a>.</p>
<p>We certainly believe in this project as we have invested a great deal of time and money into bringing you the best indie content with no subscription fees ever. And we have great television shows and documentaries with more to come. But we still have much more to do, and that's where you come in.</p>
<p>This is no small feat and we are certainly grateful to all those who will help us reach our goal. In fact, if we go over our goal we'll donate half that money to charity. And for those who choose other options that come with perks and swag, so to speak, we'll pick a charity at each donation level and fund half the proceeds to each. If we are going to ask for donations we feel that paying it forward is an absolute must.</p>
<p>What happens if we meet our goal? We can acquire more and better content. We can develop new shows for existing series. We can get Adam a truck so he can chase tornadoes. We can create music-based shows and food truck shows and millennial-forward documentaries that focus on today's issues and challenges. Most of all we want to provide relevant, non-biased news shows. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What will we do with $250,000 (or more)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create apps on the most popular streaming platforms available.</li>
<li>Develop new episodes for existing shows and create shows of our own.</li>
<li>Recruit college students for paid internships in all aspects of broadcast media.</li>
<li>Get Adam a Storm Chasing Truck.</li>
<li>Get a Food Truck and a VW Micro Bus for other shows we want to develop.</li>
<li>MOST OF ALL - Show big banks and venture capitalists that we can build a community of viewers and contributors that are far more invested in our success than they ever could be. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</strong></h3>
<p>We don't like to talk about failure but I suppose it is a valid question. Let's just say - WE WILL NOT FAIL - and know that even if we fall short of our stated goal we'll use the donations we do get to soldier on under the same premise: free content available on the most relevant streaming applications so that our content can be accessed by everybody.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How will your contribution make a difference? Let me start by saying nothing means more to us than your belief that we will be successful. By giving us at least one dollar you're telling us that you believe in the same values that we do. There are so many <i><strong>great independent web series </strong></i>that just don't get the visibility they deserve. We'd like to show those wonderful people that there are hundreds of thousands of viewers who want to see what they are offering, and give them the encouragement to follow their dreams one donated dollar at a time.</p>
<p>It's been a labor of love that we have finally launched on Apple TV. So many wonderful people have contributed hard work, great ideas, and a few dollars here and there to make that happen. We have seen Apple downloads increase every week and some shows are starting to gain popularity. Imagine what we could do if Jivewired TV was available on all streaming platforms?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and challenges come with every new venture. Most businesses fail within six months of their creation. But we've come further than 99.9% of others who have tried to accomplish what we do. It sounds strange that we need an influx of capital to get over that last hurdle. Most companies like Jivewired would need millions of dollars at this point.  To use an historical metaphor, we're 30-feet from gold but we just need a few more shovels to get there. Clearing that six-month hurdle will ensure our success. We firmly believe that.</p>
<p>It is important to make our content accessible to EVERYBODY to ensure that success. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute financially, and we fully understand that, but that doesn't mean you can't help in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign through your social media accounts.</li>
<li>Don't be shy in using all of the wonderful Indiegogo share tools!</li>

Who is fated to die and who will be pushed to pull the trigger?</i></p></div><div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In development since 2019, the first season of Trigger consists of seven episodes and is ready to go into production -  with plans for a second season already drafted in case all goes to plan! To say the journey was an easy one would be an outright lie but several table reads and multiple page 0 rewrites, this gripping tale is ready to be shared with the world.</p>
<p>The Pilot episode works to establish the tone of the series, sets up core storylines and invites you to hopefully fall in love with the characters - even if it is for the wrong reasons. Sometimes the most toxic of characters can be our favourite… and that’s okay too.</p>
<p>By producing and releasing the first episode of Trigger, we are hoping to pick up momentum surrounding the series and demonstrate both its potential and its marketability. This will assist us in either reaching out to networks and producers or allow us to successfully crowd fund the rest of the series - now armed with a tangible proof of concept.</p>
<p>Trigger at its core explores friendly, familial and romantic dynamics in the face of deceit, betrayal and upheaval through the lens of four university students who find themselves embroiled in a disastrous chain of events which culminates in the murder of one of their own.</p>
<p>To do this, the series navigates between two different timelines using flash-forwards at both the beginning and the end of each episode, with the present-day narrative making up the rest of the show. This allows us to build anticipation and tension by teasing the aftermath of the murder while still concealing the identities of the victim and the shooter as we use the present timeline to reveal the chain of events which ultimately culminates in the shooting.</p>
<p>The ensemble protagonists (Levi, Esme, Maisie and Lexie) are four university housemates, each with a secret to their name and character arcs which will overlap with fatal consequences in the penultimate episode.</p>
<div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Lead Characters</u></h3></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Levi Azzi: </strong></p>
<p>Born a Bisexual Middle Eastern Catholic, Levi’s existence itself challenges every conventional norm his family aligns itself with. Because of this, he has quite the reputation for being the black sheep of the family. Despite his family’s affluence, Levi has never been happy; in fact, he loathes not only his family’s mistreatment of him but also their views and beliefs.</p>
<p>Following years of self-loathing, Levi ultimately spiralled out of control and led himself down a darker path than anyone had ever foreseen. Spending his family’s wealth on parties, alcohol and drugs, Levi tanked almost every relationship in his life – from his broken family dynamic to his called-off engagement to ex-fiancée, Rachel.<br/><br/>The only constant presence in his life is his best friend and twin flame, Esme Meyer but they share a lot more than just a sibling dynamic… they share a dark secret that could be the undoing of them both.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Esme Meyer:</strong></p>
<p>Forced to be a mother before she could be a sister, Esme is the eldest of five siblings and the family’s matriarch since childhood. Because of her abusive parents’ substance abuse issues, Esme matured before her years and single-handedly raise her brothers and sisters in her parent’s absence.</p>
<p>Although her childhood may have hardened her, Esme’s ambition and desperation to escape her broken past is concealed by her heart of gold – but when your entire childhood has been a battlefield, you know exactly when to take the shot.</p>
<p>While her mother, Donna, re-appears whenever a problem arises, her father Gabe disappeared completely before she turned seventeen. Initially, Esme would shoplift and steal to keep herself and her siblings fed but was eventually caught – only to be bailed out by a posh rich boy looking for a way to spend his father’s money: Levi.</p>
<p>The pair immediately struck up a friendship and over the years supported each other through everything… and that’s not an understatement – if Levi knows where the bodies are hidden you better believe Esme knows full well how they got there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lexie Scott:</strong></p>
<p>One half of a set of twins, Lexie owns her independence in a way that intimidates everyone in her life – including her sister Cece. Confident and self-assured, Lexie does what she can to keep her comfortable lifestyle, sometimes at the cost of her friends and family.  </p>
<p>Lexie is driven by her need for validation, be it physical, verbal or virtual and her charisma lends itself greatly to this – although at times this can cause her to become quite arrogant and self-serving.</p>
<p>Constantly adapting to her surroundings, Lexie is a social butterfly who cares for anyone and everyone, sometimes a little too much. A true believer of people being a product of circumstance, Lexie sets out to mend ‘broken’ people but while she knows to apologise when she’s wrong, she also won’t back down if she believes she’s right… and she almost always is.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Maisie Walters:</strong></p>
<p>Lost in a world where everyone she knows either abandons her or dies, Maisie clings to familiarity and her remaining loved ones with every fibre of her being.  A protective, if not misguided friend but an even scarier enemy; once you’ve crossed Maisie, there’s no coming back from it – regardless of how hard you can try.</p>
<p>Driven by an innate desire to belong to someone or something, Maisie is fuelled by her need for security and stability in a life where she’s had no control – sometimes at the cost of her own mental health and well-being.</p>
<p>Maisie is described by those who see her as a blunt Ice Queen to anyone outside of her social circle but as soon as she’s warmed to you, you’ll thaw a friend willing to go to lengths to keep your connection alive.<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Supporting Ensemble</u></h3>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong></p>
<p>Levi’s ex-fiancée of five years and Esme’s close-friend, Rachel has been a constant presence in their life up until recently. After a difficult year of trials and tribulations, mostly dealing with Levi’s drug-use, Rachel and Levi came to a bitter end; with love, resentment and rage fuelling them both.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Donna:</strong></p>
<p>Mother to Esme and a variety of other children, Donna Meyers was a neglectful parent at best but one disillusioned by her love for her ex-husband and Esme's father, Gabe.

<p>Straight-talking and direct, Cece’s ballsy attitude is not too dissimilar to her twin sister Lexie’s but also in a completely different league of her own.  Perceptive, witty and intelligent, Cece was a prodigy encouraged by her parents to hone her intelligence and channel it into becoming a lawyer – a self-professed title she claimed at age 8.</p>

<p>Having been expelled from university for possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply, Tyler would continue relying on his dad for monetary support until physically assaulting him and consequently having all his benefits terminated.

<h3>
<br/>Why a web-series and not a television series?</h3>
<p>Television is for me, as I’m sure it is for a lot of you, an escape from reality and a safe haven where all danger is fictional and entertainment is thrilling and exciting. From a very young age, it has been my dream to create immersive narratives and compelling characters that not only take the audience on a compelling journey but invites them to reflect on their own life.</p>
<p>However, it’s no secret that producing a tv series is extensively costly and so, for an independent creator like myself, a web-series is a much more budget friendly approach and doesn’t require the heavy production costs, celebrity talent or large media platforms an average TV series does.</p>
<p>Additionally, a web-series also allows for more creative freedom as the narratives and character arcs don’t have to be amended or diluted to fit certain niches - usually allowing for a more collaborative end product.  This also allows the show to act as a show reel for all the new and upcoming talents showcased on the series and those working behind the scenes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
<br/>Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, with a global pandemic, the struggling economy and an ignored creative industry, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for independent artists and creators to get their foot in the door. Even with immense talent and initiative, it can be difficult if not impossible to have your voice heard let alone make it into the room.<br/><br/>It was for these reasons I ultimately decided that self-producing, and therefore crowdfunding, would be the best way to establish myself as a serious creator. My aim with this project is to share my work with the masses whilst also providing a paid opportunity for other up and coming talents to showcase their skills.</p>
</div>

</div></div>","Web-series OverviewTitle: TriggerGenre: Mystery/DramaFormat: 7x 40 Minute EpisodesAge Rating: 16+Logline: A group of university students and their catastrophic decisions embroil them in a series of events culminating in the murder of one of their own. Who is fated to die and who will be pushed to pull the trigger?
Summary
In development since 2019, the first season of Trigger consists of seven episodes and is ready to go into production -  with plans for a second season already drafted in case all goes to plan! To say the journey was an easy one would be an outright lie but several table reads and multiple page 0 rewrites, this gripping tale is ready to be shared with the world.
The Pilot episode works to establish the tone of the series, sets up core storylines and invites you to hopefully fall in love with the characters - even if it is for the wrong reasons. Sometimes the most toxic of characters can be our favourite… and that’s okay too.
By producing and releasing the first episode of Trigger, we are hoping to pick up momentum surrounding the series and demonstrate both its potential and its marketability. This will assist us in either reaching out to networks and producers or allow us to successfully crowd fund the rest of the series - now armed with a tangible proof of concept.
Trigger at its core explores friendly, familial and romantic dynamics in the face of deceit, betrayal and upheaval through the lens of four university students who find themselves embroiled in a disastrous chain of events which culminates in the murder of one of their own.
To do this, the series navigates between two different timelines using flash-forwards at both the beginning and the end of each episode, with the present-day narrative making up the rest of the show. This allows us to build anticipation and tension by teasing the aftermath of the murder while still concealing the identities of the victim and the shooter as we use the present timeline to reveal the chain of events which ultimately culminates in the shooting.
The ensemble protagonists (Levi, Esme, Maisie and Lexie) are four university housemates, each with a secret to their name and character arcs which will overlap with fatal consequences in the penultimate episode.
Lead Characters

Levi Azzi: 
Born a Bisexual Middle Eastern Catholic, Levi’s existence itself challenges every conventional norm his family aligns itself with. Because of this, he has quite the reputation for being the black sheep of the family. Despite his family’s affluence, Levi has never been happy; in fact, he loathes not only his family’s mistreatment of him but also their views and beliefs.
Following years of self-loathing, Levi ultimately spiralled out of control and led himself down a darker path than anyone had ever foreseen. Spending his family’s wealth on parties, alcohol and drugs, Levi tanked almost every relationship in his life – from his broken family dynamic to his called-off engagement to ex-fiancée, Rachel.The only constant presence in his life is his best friend and twin flame, Esme Meyer but they share a lot more than just a sibling dynamic… they share a dark secret that could be the undoing of them both.
 
Esme Meyer:
Forced to be a mother before she could be a sister, Esme is the eldest of five siblings and the family’s matriarch since childhood. Because of her abusive parents’ substance abuse issues, Esme matured before her years and single-handedly raise her brothers and sisters in her parent’s absence.
Although her childhood may have hardened her, Esme’s ambition and desperation to escape her broken past is concealed by her heart of gold – but when your entire childhood has been a battlefield, you know exactly when to take the shot.
While her mother, Donna, re-appears whenever a problem arises, her father Gabe disappeared completely before she turned seventeen. Initially, Esme would shoplift and steal to keep herself and her siblings fed but was eventually caught – only to be bailed out by a posh rich boy looking for a way to spend his father’s money: Levi.
The pair immediately struck up a friendship and over the years supported each other through everything… and that’s not an understatement – if Levi knows where the bodies are hidden you better believe Esme knows full well how they got there.
 
Lexie Scott:
One half of a set of twins, Lexie owns her independence in a way that intimidates everyone in her life – including her sister Cece. Confident and self-assured, Lexie does what she can to keep her comfortable lifestyle, sometimes at the cost of her friends and family.  
Lexie is driven by her need for validation, be it physical, verbal or virtual and her charisma lends itself greatly to this – although at times this can cause her to become quite arrogant and self-serving.
Constantly adapting to her surroundings, Lexie is a social butterfly who cares for anyone and everyone, sometimes a little too much. A true believer of people being a product of circumstance, Lexie sets out to mend ‘broken’ people but while she knows to apologise when she’s wrong, she also won’t back down if she believes she’s right… and she almost always is. 
Maisie Walters:
Lost in a world where everyone she knows either abandons her or dies, Maisie clings to familiarity and her remaining loved ones with every fibre of her being.  A protective, if not misguided friend but an even scarier enemy; once you’ve crossed Maisie, there’s no coming back from it – regardless of how hard you can try.
Driven by an innate desire to belong to someone or something, Maisie is fuelled by her need for security and stability in a life where she’s had no control – sometimes at the cost of her own mental health and well-being.
Maisie is described by those who see her as a blunt Ice Queen to anyone outside of her social circle but as soon as she’s warmed to you, you’ll thaw a friend willing to go to lengths to keep your connection alive. 
Supporting Ensemble
Rachel:
Levi’s ex-fiancée of five years and Esme’s close-friend, Rachel has been a constant presence in their life up until recently. After a difficult year of trials and tribulations, mostly dealing with Levi’s drug-use, Rachel and Levi came to a bitter end; with love, resentment and rage fuelling them both.
 
Donna:
Mother to Esme and a variety of other children, Donna Meyers was a neglectful parent at best but one disillusioned by her love for her ex-husband and Esme's father, Gabe. Esme's resentment for her childhood led her to escape the family home and so their relationship is strained, contentious and best described as a battlefield. 
Cece:
Straight-talking and direct, Cece’s ballsy attitude is not too dissimilar to her twin sister Lexie’s but also in a completely different league of her own.  Perceptive, witty and intelligent, Cece was a prodigy encouraged by her parents to hone her intelligence and channel it into becoming a lawyer – a self-professed title she claimed at age 8.
Tyler:
Tyler, the son of renowned business mogul Aidan Robinson, is 25, money-motivated, arrogant and characteristically self-centred. Never having to work a day in his life, Tyler had grown accustomed to living a lavish lifestyle and being surrounded by the best – eventually turning to offloading drugs for cash after being cut off by his father.
Having been expelled from university for possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply, Tyler would continue relying on his dad for monetary support until physically assaulting him and consequently having all his benefits terminated. This only drove him to double down on his behaviour and selling more expensive substances for a quicker pay out.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Topher McLean and I'm originally from Fayetteville, NC.  Since I was given my first video camera as a teenager I have desired to become a great film director.  In high school I (along with a teammate) was ranked 1st and 3rd in the state in the SkillsUSA television broadcasting competitions held at Elon University (2005 and 2006 respectively).  I continued to pursue my interest in college before going to NYC to pursue a career on Broadway.  </p>
<p>After 6 years of being a freelance stagehand in midtown Manhattan, and nearing my 30th birthday, I've decided the time has come to get serious about pursuing my dreams.  For that to happen, Topher TV needs some capital.  </p>
<p>In the first phase of the channel's upgrade, we need capital to ensure that the content can not only be created but regularly improved upon.  Phase 1 is meant to provide content for the next 5 months.  This will include (at minimum) 5 new episodes of The Reboot Series (Topher TV's current main attraction), 5 entertaining monologue performances, and 2 video essays (topics will be related to the entertainment business), and a film themed podcast.   </p>
<p>If I'm able to succeed in this campaign, it will mean the world to me.  I will feel more freedom in creating an interesting and entertaining product which I can build the foundation of a brand upon.  So come live vicariously through me as I attempt to make my dreams come true!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $1,000 to get started.  This money will go to a number of things which include transportation costs, paying a camera operator for each video, equipment upgrades, educational courses, and the cost of this fundraiser.  </p>
<p>What will you get for contributing?  Perk highlights include being able to choose what monologues I perform (some restrictions apply), getting a special personalized thank you video from me sent to you, a personal acting class (using my ""actor as an instrument"" philosophy) taught by me, and even a cameo during one of my videos!</p>
<p>The general estimated budget that I have worked out is as follows: </p>
<p>-$350 Travel and Transportation:  Episodes of The Reboot Series are planned to take place in at least 3 states (can't tell you where because that would be a spoiler :p )</p>
<p>-$200 Digital Upload and Storage:  The volume of things that need to be filmed will exceed my current storage and upload capabilities.  This amount will offset these costs.  </p>
<p>-$200 Camera Operator Pay:  This will be paired with personal finances to cover the costs of having someone operate the camera when needed.  </p>
<p>-$150+ Equipment and Software Upgrades, Education, Props, and Other needs:  New equipment, both hardware and software, will be needed to improve the quality of the videos.  Additionally, participation at various web seminars and other classes are being planned.  Any additional funds beyond these needs will go towards props and other production costs.</p>
<p>In addition to what has been listed, we are also setting aside money to pay for the IndieGoGO fees and other bank fees.  </p>
<p>If all the funds are not raised what happens?  Well, the funds raised will be spread out appropriately to ensure the best possible content can be released.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why should you care if I make Topher TV?  Well... because it's going to be HELLA ENTERTAINING, of course!  Don't believe me?  Check out recent projects produced by Topher TV on YouTube, it's only going to get better from there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When I produced Topher TV as a web series a couple of years ago, we had to halt production midway through the 3rd episodes production.  I've learned a lot since then, both from that experience and other experiences.  I am confident that I can deliver a far superior product than I previously have.  By reducing the number of collaborators I rely on to produce content, I am making sure that I can deliver an affordable product.  </p>
<p>I do expect challenges when it comes to pulling off harder shots with less experienced camera operators, but the funds raised that can go towards ensuring I can use a regular camera operator leaves me feeling confident that I can succeed and improve.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>Can't afford to donate?  You can still help by spreading the word!  This is going to be a very short fundraising period, so every bit of help will go a long way.  </p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Rohmon Merchant and I am the creator and producer of Superficially Deep. I have been a mostly a hip hop artist and writer for most of my life and I and compelled by telling great stories for the world to hear. Superficially Deep is a project close to my heart because it gives a clean perspective to the traditional faith-based projects, where we share stories from a very real life, and also give a very family friendly show with the same intrigue and drama from mainstream television. With your generous contributions, we can finish the next 18 episodes of the show quicker, with better equipment and pay our actors and crew to put together a very quality show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our budget that we are needing to meet is $1 Million. All of our cast and crew came to this project pro bono, and gave time, sweat equity, and personal sacrifice to be part of this project, many of them have not asked for a dime. We have also used the equipment that we had, with the knowledge we obtain to make 6 episodes of this show. Our goal however is to make 24 episodes (2 Seasons) of the show and we would like to upgrade our equipment to a more industry standard look, and pay stipends to all cast and crew involved in this project. Also to build our wardrobe, and bring in more elements like hair and make-up. </p>
<p>We have many exciting Perks from great grabs from our clothing line to being actual part of the show, and even having producer credit in the show.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal; frankly that won't stop us, we are still currently working on new episodes as we speak, and with the funds we do generate, we will make it work and make sure at the very least our cast and crew have gas in their cars and that we can pay for locations to shoot.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Superficially Deep tells an impactful story of young people who believe in God and have a relationship through church but live in a very real and tangible way. I believe that seeing yourself in the media and on TV is important, but when it comes to faith-based characters seem to be more 2 dimensional and unbelievable. ""SD"" creates characters that are more like the people we come across everyday, situations are more believable and everything isn't fixed within a matter of minutes, but it is real experiences. It shows believers as real people with real life issues; not your basic ""holier-than-thou"" type christian. It shows that just because you go to church doesn't mean we have it all together either, we have the same problems as most, we just have different options in which to deal with it.</p>
<p>This show is the first of its kind; and we are excited about that. Which is why so many people love working on this show right now. The script is ingenious, the acting is superb, and the scoop is great, it is a show you would want to watch over and over again.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Obstacles</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In making this project we ran across some challenges the biggest was distribution we had 2 deals and they both fell through, the most recent being COVID shutting down a company, so we ran into the issue of getting the show out. We solved that problem hanging on to our own IP and launching our own streaming service on Roku tv's to distribute our show. Hopefully we can find other artist to collaborate with for future project, but we are out here and we are working to make this happen.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you for any and all contributions, but if you can't please share our campaign, let's get the word, lets bring some good quality shows back on the small screen. Use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word, thanks!</p>

Our goal however is to make 24 episodes (2 Seasons) of the show and we would like to upgrade our equipment to a more industry standard look, and pay stipends to all cast and crew involved in this project. Also to build our wardrobe, and bring in more elements like hair and make-up. 
We have many exciting Perks from great grabs from our clothing line to being actual part of the show, and even having producer credit in the show.
If we don't reach our goal; frankly that won't stop us, we are still currently working on new episodes as we speak, and with the funds we do generate, we will make it work and make sure at the very least our cast and crew have gas in their cars and that we can pay for locations to shoot.
 

The Impact
Superficially Deep tells an impactful story of young people who believe in God and have a relationship through church but live in a very real and tangible way. I believe that seeing yourself in the media and on TV is important, but when it comes to faith-based characters seem to be more 2 dimensional and unbelievable. ""SD"" creates characters that are more like the people we come across everyday, situations are more believable and everything isn't fixed within a matter of minutes, but it is real experiences. It shows believers as real people with real life issues; not your basic ""holier-than-thou"" type christian. It shows that just because you go to church doesn't mean we have it all together either, we have the same problems as most, we just have different options in which to deal with it.
This show is the first of its kind; and we are excited about that. Which is why so many people love working on this show right now. The script is ingenious, the acting is superb, and the scoop is great, it is a show you would want to watch over and over again.
Risks & Obstacles

In making this project we ran across some challenges the biggest was distribution we had 2 deals and they both fell through, the most recent being COVID shutting down a company, so we ran into the issue of getting the show out. We solved that problem hanging on to our own IP and launching our own streaming service on Roku tv's to distribute our show. Hopefully we can find other artist to collaborate with for future project, but we are out here and we are working to make this happen.

<p>This fundraiser is to assist production of a new series called <strong>“Window On Our World” (WOW)</strong>. This educational program will highlight many of the unknown aspects of the United States’ Moon landing in 1969.  NASA’s Fred Peters, now 85, was the Supervising Spacecraft Project Engineer for designing and building the Moon Lander. He will chronicle this incredible NASA feat of 52 years ago in the forthcoming WOW production. Since NASA has renewed interest in space exploration, this series will help to introduce new viewers to the space program and its beginnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Peters recently said, “I spent a hundreds of hours helping to develop the Apollo project and enjoyed every minute of it.” Mr. Peters will inform viewers by providing his insights in a way that will help you feel the adventure and excitement he felt about this project.  He never had much interest in science fiction but he was very interested in rockets. As such, as the Team Supervisor and Project Engineer, he and his team helped to build the rocket and Moon Lander that was the most life changing and exciting historic event of the day.  Mr. Peters worked in the Space Program for over 36 years.  After the Apollo Program Mr. Peters was assigned to the Skylab Program Office as Project Engineer for the Skylab Orbital Workshop.  The Skylab Program’s end began a change in Mr. Peters’ career with a move into management positions for planning and scheduling in the Space Transportation Systems Program Office, the Orbiter Project Office and the Payloads Project Office.  A short time was spent out of NASA in the private sector but he returned to NASA to be assigned as Resident Manager for Work Package 2 of the International Space Station at the McDonald Douglas plant in Huntington Beach, California.  His last assignment was as the NASA/JSC representative to the California Space Institute at the University of California San Diego.  He retired from NASA in 1997.</p>
<p>Golden Network.TV (GNTV) will explore the effort it took to get to the Moon in an eight (8) episode series called, <strong>“Window on Our World” (WOW)</strong>.  Our seniors, their families, and friends will learn the inside scoop of what really happened behind the scenes.  You will be told many interesting and fascinating things that were never made public.</p>
<p>Mr. Peters will discuss the importance of the Apollo project and why it was of interest to the United States and the World. He will also explain why it is important to you and what the space programs offshoot of great products have done to make life so much better for all.</p>
<p><strong>President John F. Kennedy was not kidding when he said, ""Going to the Moon was hard"".</strong></p>
<p>Much of the technology needed to get to the lunar surface and return did not exist at the time of Kennedy’s famous 1962 speech. Much was unknown. As NASA’s Apollo missions were being planned, there was concern that the lunar module might sink into the Moon’s surface or become stuck in it.  As it turned out, the surface was hard and supported the lunar module without any problems.</p>
<p>NASA had to start from scratch by inventing space travel. In 1961, there was no rocket big enough to go to the Moon, hence the development of the Saturn V rocket. There were no spaceships that could land on the Moon. No computer was small enough or fast enough to do the math necessary to fly to the Moon, and no computers anywhere in the world. There were no spacesuits or space food. In the early years of the program, people were furiously doing the engineering and making the technological developments to make it possible to fly in space.</p>
<p>Why was the Apollo Program Important? These trips helped NASA to explore other worlds later on. Apollo also provided our first detailed look at another planetary body. It showed us how special the Earth-Moon system is. It was the Apollo 11 mission that demonstrated convincingly for the first time how ancient the Moon is. The samples brought back were over 3 billion years old.</p>
<p>Project Apollo's goals went beyond landing Americans on the Moon and returning them safely to Earth. They included establishing the technology to meet other national interests in space and achieving preeminence in space for the United States.</p>
<p>NASA met that challenge with the Apollo program. It was the first time human beings left Earth orbit and visited another world. These missions made it possible to explore more distant worlds later on.</p>
<p>Directors such as twelve-time Emmy Award-nominee and four-time Emmy Award winner, <strong>Sheldon I. Altfeld</strong>, who has been an actor, writer, producer, and director in Hollywood since 1950, is anticipated to be working on this project.  His extensive credits have spanned every aspect of the entertainment industry, including radio, television, motion pictures, stage productions, and recording.  Full bio available on request.</p>
<p>One of the Producers of the show is <strong>Mr. Ron Kramer</strong>.  With over 35 years in the entertainment industry, Mr. Kramer has achieved major success in music, film, and television. He was Senior Vice President of Music Publishing at Capitol Records/EMI, where he supervised all of Capitol Record’s music publishing companies, with offices in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, and Toronto.  Mr. Kramer was Associate Producer of the Grammy Awards for more than ten years and is a past Chairman of the Board of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.  Full bio available on request.</p>

<h3>What Is This?</h3>
<p><strong>Fishbowl Show</strong> is a volunteer comedy sketch group aimed to provide a platform for Perth creatives to produce content on a regular basis. It all began as a vision between a few young individuals who shared a love for comedy and filmmaking. We were eager to hone our craft, collaborate with our peers and above all else, create funny content. So, we got to work and quickly grew. Now, with 5 sketches produced and more scripts in the pipeline, we have more ideas and are even more pumped to create more content!</p>
<p>However, with filmmaking also come many expenses. With your help, we can keep this platform alive, develop it and create more opportunities!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Work</h3>
<p>Our sketches range anywhere from 1 minutes to 6 minutes of various format and topic but all with a comedic theme. Our latest sketch, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsivTIVJxFc&amp;t=35s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Undercover Worker</a> was chosen as an Official Selection in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FunniestShorts/photos/a.119426491841869/518360665281781/?type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Australia's Funniest Shorts Festival</a> that is screening in Bunbury, Western Australia as a part of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CinefestOZ/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CinefestOZ</a> this August 25. </p>

<h3>How Will the Money Be Spent?</h3>
<p>All cast &amp; crew participate on a voluntary basis. Productions come with a long list of expenses. With 10 scripts to film, we have carefully planned our budget to ensure it is as cost-efficient as possible. All funds will go into production costs such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Food - </strong>Productions are often long hours. We want to ensure our cast &amp; crew are always on top of their game by being well fed and hydrated while on set. This will be the largest aspect of the budget.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment </strong>- In order to be as cost-efficient as we can, most equipment has been sourced and arranged with no charges. However, not all equipment will be available to us for free and as such, a small percentage of the budget will be used to cover such expenses. </li>
<li>
<strong>Set Design &amp; Props </strong>- We do our best to use existing materials to be cost-efficient. However, that may not always be the case and a small percentage of our budget is set aside for this. </li>
<li>
<strong>Distribution </strong>- We also want to give our sketches the best visibility it can get. A small percentage of the budget will be used to meet submission fees for film festivals.</li>

Fishbowl Show is a volunteer comedy sketch group aimed to provide a platform for Perth creatives to produce content on a regular basis. It all began as a vision between a few young individuals who shared a love for comedy and filmmaking. We were eager to hone our craft, collaborate with our peers and above all else, create funny content. So, we got to work and quickly grew. Now, with 5 sketches produced and more scripts in the pipeline, we have more ideas and are even more pumped to create more content!
However, with filmmaking also come many expenses. With your help, we can keep this platform alive, develop it and create more opportunities!
 

Our Work
Our sketches range anywhere from 1 minutes to 6 minutes of various format and topic but all with a comedic theme. Our latest sketch, Undercover Worker was chosen as an Official Selection in Australia's Funniest Shorts Festival that is screening in Bunbury, Western Australia as a part of CinefestOZ this August 25.

His post-production work includes corporate videos, documentaries and many of our very own sketches. 
SOUND RECORDIST & DESIGNER - Diego Espinoza

Diego loves music and was a drummer in his teenage years. His involvement in film began when he was approached to help on productions by friends while studying Sound Production in Murdoch University. Since then, he never looked back and has been involved in various projects. In 2017, he was nominated for best sound design at NexGen Film Festival.

<p>Hi, my name is John Servedio and this is our story.</p>
<p>I was a high school student that dreamed of creating and directing short films and sketches to entertain and provide some levity in the harsh political climate that we live in today. Due to my financial limitations and lack of crew, I was unable to bring my vision to the small screen. But recently, I had the epiphany that there are plenty of students, like myself, who are interested in careers as filmmakers and actors. They shared my drive and passion for a project like this one and I realized that we just needed someone to take this idea and bring it to life.

</div></div>","Hi, my name is John Servedio and this is our story.
I was a high school student that dreamed of creating and directing short films and sketches to entertain and provide some levity in the harsh political climate that we live in today. Due to my financial limitations and lack of crew, I was unable to bring my vision to the small screen. But recently, I had the epiphany that there are plenty of students, like myself, who are interested in careers as filmmakers and actors. They shared my drive and passion for a project like this one and I realized that we just needed someone to take this idea and bring it to life. I took that responsibility into my own hands, and when others showed interest, I knew the sky was the limit. With the help from my dear friends Autumn Bishop (my project manager and AD) and Jon Ovadia (my creative consultant and another AD), I set out to produce the projects I have written. Our only limitation at the moment is one of finances. With your donations, we would be able to create an opportunity that these young actors and film makers won't receive in many other places.

<h2><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>We are seeking $10,000 in funding to cover production of the trailer for RIF. This trailer will be used to shop the multi-episode series around to major networks for full-scale production. At the moment we have significant interest in producing the show, but our potential funders aren't interested in the small-scale production of the trailer. That's where you come in!</p>
<h3><strong>Our Team</strong></h3>
<p>We have brought together a skilled team of professionals to produce and sell RIF:</p>
<p><strong>Saudia Davis</strong> is an artist, social entrepreneur, and a film producer based out of Chicago. She prides herself on creating spaces in which artists can play with their talents and reach their full potential. In 2009 she founded Smart Pants are Leaders (SPAL), an organization that drives youth empowerment through arts &amp; gardening. More recently, she lead efforts to restore a 1000-seat theater on the West side of Chicago and open it to the community. Saudia brings over 20 years of film and television experience to the RIF team and has spent her time both in front of and behind the camera. Above all, Saudia prides herself in nurturing new talent and encouraging greatness through art. </p>
<p><strong>Jacque Rabie</strong> is a Los Angles-based filmmaker studying Directing at Chapman University. From a young age, heʼs loved storytelling - beginning with game design and the release of several iOS apps, and ending up as a narrative and commercial director. He has worked on over 40 narrative shorts and directed commercials for startups such as <i>Breadr </i>and <i>Tovala</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Samantha Kurtz</strong> is a production designer based out of Los Angeles. Sheʼs currently a sophomore at Chapman University and works as a production designer. She began her career as an art PA and eventually worked her way up to art directing sets with a crew of hundreds. With this, sheʼs ready to take on a new passion project and create a gritty aesthetic with costumes and design that match the gritty world of RIF.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Pontrelli</strong> is our narrative Director of Photography. He has worked on hundreds of sets as a 1st AC, key grip, best boy, and has experience with every other piece of camera department. His experience as a DP extends to shooting upperclassman projects at Chapman, to numerous collaborations with Jacque such as on the <i>Tovala </i>commercial. His dramatic, low-key lighting style is a perfect match for RIF.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mickael Gold. I moved to Los Angeles a few years ago because I grew up watching films from the 80s set in this beautiful city of angels. Unfortunately, now in the movies they do not pay it justice enough. I saw a lack of motivational messages in all of the recent blockbusters. The main characters are not really goals to reach and that is what we want to change. I want to show the young generations that there are new heights to reach. Millennials have no idea what it is like to be respected, have honor, dignity, pride, or other values that the generation before was supposed to teach us. Instead they decided to undermine us and keep us assisted.</p>
<p>The series is about an actor who gets his life turned around. ""After getting a role stolen, Jackson, a young wannabe actor, finds himself driving a tough guy producer around the beautiful yet dangerous city of Angels, the same city where he last saw his father.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is funding for the production. Ironically we do not require fundings for the general needs of a production because frankly what is behind the camera doesn't necessarily matter as much as what's in front of the camera.</p>
<p>We need to find houses to show life of celebrities in LA; sports car; luxury clothes. All of that needs to be perfect. The show needs to do exactly what it is, ""SHOW"". Instead of only seeing celebrity lifestyle on Instagram, imagine if there was a series that described you how a young actor full dream actually reach that lifestyle by not giving up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This series that we are producing is not just for entertainment purposes, but also to rise up to the best version of each of ourselves. Think about all of those great films and series from 40 years ago that pushed us to be better people and to not blindly accept our fate. Help us show the rest of the world that it gets brighter at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>I already produced one short film that successfully shared the idea in mind. You can find it on Youtube. Although I have experiences, this show is totally new and is like never seen before</p>
<p>A series that is about luxury lifestyle, intense car chases, breathtaking panoramic view of the city of Angels, and many other characteristic that we miss from the films and tv shows in the 80s.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I presented this show to a production company and they told me that the impact was not real, that it will not be relatable for anyone. Their answer shows how much I need to make this project happen. People do not want to believe anymore, they do not want to dream anymore. Recently, production companies have just made franchises that already worked before because it is not risky, but that is not how we can change our everyday life. The world is not well right now, because humanity is not well. Everyone is sitting on their couch, binge-watching the same thing over and over again. Films and shows that have either brutal and horrific violence, or overdramatic suicide stories, and yes all of this is current in our society but people don't necessarily want to watch their regular life. I want to show the audience a more OPTIMISTIC point of view and I can assure you that I will do it anyway even if I have to film it with my phone and spend all of my savings.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The best part of this fundraising campaign is that I do not necessarily ask for money.  I exposed to you exactly what we were missing, so you as an investor can either send us money in exchange for different benefits, or find us what we are looking for (mansions, sports car, luxury clothes...). Share it on social media, email us if you find something. Get involved with this project because it is the kind of project you would love to binge-watch. Imagine the satisfaction when you will see this show on Hulu, Youtube, Netflix, Amazon and other streaming platforms and you will be able to say you made it happen.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>(RE)WILD MOTHERHOOD- Mothers have been taught to believe that a wild childhood is magic, but a wild motherhood is selfish, childish, somehow wrong - and that’s not true. I want the stories of these magical wild mamas to help dispel these myths. (RE)WILD MOTHERHOOD is a web series that aims to tell stories that haven't been told before. Too often women- mother's voices are overlooked in the outdoor community. Motherhood outdoors is often dismissed as not ""epic"" enough, not ""wild"" enough- when in reality the journey of motherhood is one of the wildest stories we can tell. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need </span></p>
<p>The primary expense is travel- in order to tell various stories with a diverse cast of women we need to be able to get to these stories.</p>
<p>Production costs</p>
<p>** None of the money will go to paying any sort of salaries- all $$ goes directly to production of the series.**</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This series seeks to promote dialogue about motherhood and inclusivity not just in the outdoors but in all areas of life.</p>
<p>It will share stories from mamas from all financial, cultural, and personal backgrounds, women of all religions, colors and sexual orientations, mamas with one child and mamas with many, women who travel the world for adventure and the mamas whose backyard is where they seek their wildness.</p>
<p>This series aims to represent motherhood in all of it’s magic and many layers shared through the lens of the wild outdoors.</p>

The primary expense is travel- in order to tell various stories with a diverse cast of women we need to be able to get to these stories.
Production costs
** None of the money will go to paying any sort of salaries- all $$ goes directly to production of the series.**

The Impact
This series seeks to promote dialogue about motherhood and inclusivity not just in the outdoors but in all areas of life.
It will share stories from mamas from all financial, cultural, and personal backgrounds, women of all religions, colors and sexual orientations, mamas with one child and mamas with many, women who travel the world for adventure and the mamas whose backyard is where they seek their wildness.
This series aims to represent motherhood in all of it’s magic and many layers shared through the lens of the wild outdoors.

<h3>A group of young Florida girls wants to pursue hockey. Comical drama quickly arises as the girls and their quirky parents embark on a road to sports equality.</h3>

</div><div>
<p>I began writing <i>Thin Ice </i>over six years ago. It started as a film script, but I quickly realized that the characters and their cause deserve much more than an hour and a half of limelight. The story is fictional. It's significance is real.</p>
<p>I grew up in a lot of ice rinks, both professional and recreational. My household was (is) full of avid NHL fans, and my little sister began playing the sport at a very young age. I saw my fair share of practices, tournaments, and team events. I witnessed first-hand the discouragement and sexism that those young Florida girls faced. I saw their parents struggle to combat those doubts and instead teach their girls about defying the odds and staying strong.</p>
<p>That fight is truly the root of <i>Thin Ice. </i>While the show is comically entertaining, it's truth lies within it's cause. The message of encouragement and passion is something I full-heartedly stand behind. You can help me bring it to light.  </p>

<p>Filming will take place by the end of 2019. The finished pilot will then be brought to distribution companies and streaming services for consideration.

<h2><u><strong>The Beat Goes On:</strong></u></h2>
<p>The Beat Goes On follows Jamie, a working-class northern teenager going through the ups and downs of everyday teen life. From heartaches to nose-breaks, we see Jamie and his friends growing up on the streets of Manchester, searching for a purpose and the meaning of everything going on around them. </p>
<p>Beautifully shot in Manchester, it will give the audience an authentic experience of life in the northern capital whilst also understanding the lifestyle habits of a teenager in today's society. The series will also address crucial social issues, such as sexual harassment and mental health in young men, approaching subjects that are often neglected and not discussed in the public eye. </p>
<p>My name is Brad Whitford, and I'm a Film Production student at Salford University. I'm 20 years old and I've grown up a stone's throw away from Manchester.  Writing has been my passion from an early age, and my dream has always been to see one of my creations come to life and for it to have an impact on people. I'm in love with Film &amp; TV and to get the chance to produce this sitcom would be a dream come true. </p>
<h2><strong><u>Where the money goes:</u></strong></h2>
<p><strong><u>Crew &amp; Casting Costs:</u></strong> For this production, we will have at least 18 members of cast and crew. To make sure that the show is the best it can be, experience will be preferred, thus leading to higher costs, but overall a much better and more professional production!</p>
<p><u><strong>Equipment Costs</strong></u>: We will be renting equipment to shoot with from an external supplier, for 5 days (intended shooting length). This includes; 2x Camera's, 2x Shotgun Mics, 2x Body Mics, 2x Tripods, Shoulder Rig, 50mm Prime Lens and a 70-200mm Telephoto Lens. All of these are necessary to produce the slickest and most clean cut show possible. </p>
<p><u><strong>Catering</strong></u>: A well-fed cast and crew makes a happy one! Working on a low budget means that it would cost quite a chunk more to shoot for more than 5 days, therefore making sure the cast and crew are happy and healthy means that productivity stays high and deadlines are met.</p>
<p><u><strong>Props/Clothing</strong></u>: Clothing is an essential part of any show as it sets the tone for the character, and allows them to express themselves boldly but silently. Being set in Manchester, you can probably guess the vibe of most of the outfits that will be in the show. Abbie Killen, a Fashion graduate from UAL will be the lead Fashion Consultant, giving some much needed expertise and insight into what someone wears can say about them.</p>
<p><u><strong>Insurance</strong></u>: Boring I know, but entirely necessary in order to stick to the budget. At least if something does go wrong we are adequately covered, meaning that productivity and the budget doesn't take a hit.</p>

<h2><u>The Story</u></h2>
<p>His family on the brink of ruin, Lt. Commander Marcus DeVol takes command of the destroyer/escort starship <strong>Chimera </strong>in a last attempt to restore his status by running down pirates and blacklisted vessels for prize money. It's a ""safe"" job by military standards, but a change of orders just before cast-off will send Marcus and his crew far from home and into very real danger.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541810068/mgm7aqgzupa3ysnx00iy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Marcus has few illusions about his purchased commission. An academic, he is untested as a leader of men, and his curious mix of officers and crew regard him with a wary eye. Like <strong>Chimera</strong> herself, they've been pieced together based more on Marcus' tight budget than their experience and reliability. Many of them are foreigners with pasts who have joined the service for a clean slate. Some are more competent than others; few of them have seen real combat.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539488239/ywxveqedbvjkfbehsfyo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the course of their mission, they will encounter both friend and foe, and venture into uncharted territories whose occupants each come with their own strange agendas. Marcus and his crew will soon be tested by combat, by uncertainty, and by fear, as every leg of their journey and every encounter brings a new set of unknowns and challenges. <strong>Into The Void</strong> is a journey deep into the blackness of hostile space, where nothing is certain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>The Show</u></h2>

<p>The year is 2641. Humanity has spread out and colonized the galaxy. Some colonies remain loyal to their masters, others rebel or request independence. Instead of monolithic United Federations ruling the galaxy, individual worlds play host to many nations, each with their own culture, traditions, and territorial claims in space.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541808967/r78adqruuqeedwo0vwno.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Into The Void  </strong>is, first and foremost, a story of characters, of military men far from home and cut off from family and loved ones -- imagine a submarine movie, set in space.

<h2><u>Impact and Ambition</u></h2>
<p>Every episode of INTO THE VOID will be at least 20 - 30 minutes long, with the pilot clocking in at at lest 60. This gives us the space to tell complete stories within episode, rather than relying on ten or more 3-minute installments to form a whole. These sound like grand ambitions, but the strides of digital technology are making shows like this more and more possible every year. The entire show will be shot on green screen and composited into virtual sets, a technique long since common to feature films and becoming steadily more so on television. I've already built the 11 sets needed for the pilot episode, as well as all the ship exteriors. I've storyboarded the entire episode from start to finish using digital dummies on the completed sets; everything from lighting to lens lengths to camera placement/movement to physical onset measurements has been figured out. I just have to shoot according to the plan, drop the footage in, and tighten up the edit.</p>
<p>I've searched all over and I've found nothing like what we're trying to do. With this show, there's a chance to make a real splash on the internet with an absorbing, broad scope, low-budget show aimed at intelligent, thinking adults, yet entertaining for just about anyone.</p>

His family on the brink of ruin, Lt. Commander Marcus DeVol takes command of the destroyer/escort starship Chimera in a last attempt to restore his status by running down pirates and blacklisted vessels for prize money. It's a ""safe"" job by military standards, but a change of orders just before cast-off will send Marcus and his crew far from home and into very real danger.

Marcus has few illusions about his purchased commission. An academic, he is untested as a leader of men, and his curious mix of officers and crew regard him with a wary eye. Like Chimera herself, they've been pieced together based more on Marcus' tight budget than their experience and reliability. Many of them are foreigners with pasts who have joined the service for a clean slate. Some are more competent than others; few of them have seen real combat.

In the course of their mission, they will encounter both friend and foe, and venture into uncharted territories whose occupants each come with their own strange agendas. Marcus and his crew will soon be tested by combat, by uncertainty, and by fear, as every leg of their journey and every encounter brings a new set of unknowns and challenges. Into The Void is a journey deep into the blackness of hostile space, where nothing is certain.
 
The Show

The year is 2641. Humanity has spread out and colonized the galaxy. Some colonies remain loyal to their masters, others rebel or request independence. Instead of monolithic United Federations ruling the galaxy, individual worlds play host to many nations, each with their own culture, traditions, and territorial claims in space.

Into The Void  is, first and foremost, a story of characters, of military men far from home and cut off from family and loved ones -- imagine a submarine movie, set in space. We've even made a deliberate effort to strip down the tech and avoid the usual gimmicks. No aliens, no laser guns, no holographic interfaces, no fusion reactors... and NO SHIELDS -- these guys are going to have to rely on heavy armor, countermeasures, and strategy to survive. Chimera is not a wealthy vessel; her crew is making do with both limited provisions and materials during their perilous mission. There will be action, but it will always be in service of the story.

<h3>What is <i>Let's Be Friends...</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Let’s Be Friends... </i>is a dramedy about the challenges that come with the discovery of your identity. Currently, we are raising money to film the <strong>Pilot Episode</strong> where roommates Lex and Charlie navigate their complexly layered friendship during an eventful house party, culminating with an uncomfortable discovery for each of them: they are definitely not straight.</p>
<p>The series is a humorous following of the friends as they grapple with the idea and execution of learning to be gay, and navigate the ramifications of their parallel-but-very-different experiences with this have on their friendship and personal identities.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get:</h3>
<p>While your contribution helps us to fund our pilot episode, it also serves as a way to begin building the community that will collaborate on and share in this story. Our perks are designed to provide you with opportunities to get directly involved in the project because sharing ownership of this is incredibly important to us. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, $15,000 is actually a small price tag for a production like this. We have some amazing actors and crew members who are dedicating their time, talents, and resources to <i>Let's Be Friends...</i> for little to nothing out of belief in this project. However, to do their talents and this story justice, we still need to afford:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment Rentals (Camera, Lighting, Sound, Electrical, etc.)</li>
<li>Insurance (Required by SAG)</li>
<li>Payroll Fees</li>
<li>Filming Permits</li>
<li>Post Production (Editing, Color Correction, Sound Mixing, Etc.)</li>
<li>Feeding the Cast &amp; Crew during production</li>
<li>Props, Set Dressing, Wardrobe, etc.</li>
<li><a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456408-Fees-Pricing-for-Campaigners-How-much-does-Indiegogo-cost-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fundraising Fees </a></li>
<li>Festival Submissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Our hope is to raise over $15,000 so that we can do more with this pilot and/or film more of the already written content for the series. There are some incredible characters and events in future episodes, so the more we raise, the more we will do. We are running an all-or-nothing campaign though, so if we do not meet our goal, we do not get any funds. It's extremely important for us to hit $15,000!</p>
<p>The minimum donation of just $10 gets you a link to download the pilot when it is completed, but larger donations offer opportunities for access to behind the scenes content, hand-made friendship bracelets, an ""Easter egg"" in the pilot, naming a character, an invitation to a premier event, and producer credit. Every contribution is hugely helpful, and super crucial in allowing us to keep momentum in this fundraiser, build a community, and give a voice and platform to this series. We have big plans for it going forward, and we cannot wait to get started!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us get the word out! If you have a friend who you think would be interested in this project, let them know! Share our campaign on social media, post about it, text about it, call your friends on the phone or send an email. It's cliche, but that really is the most helpful thing you can do!</p>
<p>Getting the word out about <i>Let's Be Friends... </i>is just as important as raising the money to shoot it. We want everyone to be as excited as we are to see this made!</p>
<p>We are also looking to bring more crew members on board as we work through pre-production during this campaign, so if you or someone you know is a queer woman working in ""the industry,"" definitely reach out with your interest.</p>

What We Need & What You'll Get:
While your contribution helps us to fund our pilot episode, it also serves as a way to begin building the community that will collaborate on and share in this story. Our perks are designed to provide you with opportunities to get directly involved in the project because sharing ownership of this is incredibly important to us. 
Believe it or not, $15,000 is actually a small price tag for a production like this. We have some amazing actors and crew members who are dedicating their time, talents, and resources to Let's Be Friends... for little to nothing out of belief in this project. However, to do their talents and this story justice, we still need to afford:

Equipment Rentals (Camera, Lighting, Sound, Electrical, etc.)
Insurance (Required by SAG)
Payroll Fees
Filming Permits
Post Production (Editing, Color Correction, Sound Mixing, Etc.)
Feeding the Cast & Crew during production
Props, Set Dressing, Wardrobe, etc.
Fundraising Fees 
Festival Submissions

Our hope is to raise over $15,000 so that we can do more with this pilot and/or film more of the already written content for the series. There are some incredible characters and events in future episodes, so the more we raise, the more we will do. We are running an all-or-nothing campaign though, so if we do not meet our goal, we do not get any funds. It's extremely important for us to hit $15,000!
The minimum donation of just $10 gets you a link to download the pilot when it is completed, but larger donations offer opportunities for access to behind the scenes content, hand-made friendship bracelets, an ""Easter egg"" in the pilot, naming a character, an invitation to a premier event, and producer credit. Every contribution is hugely helpful, and super crucial in allowing us to keep momentum in this fundraiser, build a community, and give a voice and platform to this series. We have big plans for it going forward, and we cannot wait to get started!

Other Ways You Can Help
Help us get the word out! If you have a friend who you think would be interested in this project, let them know! Share our campaign on social media, post about it, text about it, call your friends on the phone or send an email. It's cliche, but that really is the most helpful thing you can do!
Getting the word out about Let's Be Friends... is just as important as raising the money to shoot it. We want everyone to be as excited as we are to see this made!
We are also looking to bring more crew members on board as we work through pre-production during this campaign, so if you or someone you know is a queer woman working in ""the industry,"" definitely reach out with your interest.",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m Bella, the writer and creator of the BABY MAMA DRAMA: WEB SERIES! Having received my B.A. in Multimedia and Filmmaking in 2015 from NJCU, I’ve been putting sincere effort into fulfilling my passion, gaining experience and creating art with the skills I have been blessed to learn while doing what I love most – STORY TELLING. With that in mind, I joined a community of like-minded artists to connect and collaborate with and became a member of the Black TV &amp; Film Collective. Through my membership, I was able to network with extremely talented, local artists whose dreams were on par with that of my own; their dedication to their craft enabling them to collaborate on the BMD project for little to nothing which is a huge blessing considering season one of BMD is very low budget and was produced with funds that were solely from my pocket. Considering I am a “starving” artist like most who don’t get paid to do what they love; I am forever grateful for resources like the BTVFC and Indie-Gogo that help artist like myself make our dreams come true. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is necessary for the production of BMD season 2 as I am no longer in the position to fund production for the web-series myself for a number of reasons – one being what is currently transpiring due to Covid-19. Speaking of, I sincerely apologize to those who may be having a hard time financially and otherwise getting through this trying time. It is not my aim to be insensitive in asking for financial assistance considering, however, season 2 has been in the making for months before the pandemic became a hindrance; and with the effort put in by the BMD team, it would hurt me to disappoint those who have made an effort from day one to take the series where we know it can go. That disappointment would be magnified if I could not find some way to bring BABY MAMA DRAMA season 2 to the fans. </p>
<p>We love our fans SO MUCH and have been listening to their suggestions and requests for an even bigger and better season 2! Your contributions will help us deliver the following:  </p>
<ul>
<li>LONGER EPISODES! - ALL episodes in season 2 will be at LEAST 15 min! (Episodes in season 1 were 8-12 min) </li>
<li>MORE EPISODES – We are bringing you EIGHT (8) all new episodes! (Season 1 we only had 6) </li>
<li>MORE CHARACTERS – We’ve had to cast THIRTEEN (13) new characters for season 2 – including the kids of the main cast that the fans have been asking for. </li>
</ul>
<p>Contributors will enable me to feed my very deserving cast and crew while on set; have access to better locations; rent more equipment for an even more cinematic production to expand on the quality fans have grown to love; pay some of our “starving” artists a little something for their time and effort; as well as props and set design to assist with visual storytelling.  </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>We have determined we would need about $7,000 to produce season 2 the way we envision it and the way our fans deserve to see it. And because we understand how big of a deal that is to raise, we have come up with some awesome perks to reward those who are fortunate and kind enough to donate – how do these babies sound? </p>
<p> How cool would it be to see your name in the credits with a “Special Thanks” shout out? Or would you like to be ON SET during production during one of our shoot days and see how fun filmmaking is behind the scenes? Or how about a small speaking role that’ll produce footage for you to add to your acting reel and experience to add to your resume? Or would you like to rub elbows with the cast, crew and other fans/supporters of BMD at our season 2 premier party?</p>
<p>The blessing of Indie-Gogo is that production for BMD will still receive whatever funds we raise should we not reach our goal of 7k and no matter the amount, it will go towards production of season 2 – being applied to remaining locations to be secured and equipment rentals like cameras, microphones, dollys, etc, but most importantly, FOOD haha. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What is currently transpiring throughout the country due to Covid-19, our project is experiencing a serious delay. We run the risk of not meeting our goal while attempting to raise funds during a pandemic however it is very important to us to bring our supporters a season 2! As the series creator, I am hoping that no matter the outcome, we are able to push forward and produce an even more entertaining and successful season.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a monetary contribution at this time, we completely understand! Because BABY MAMA DRAMA already represents a collection of artists, we are also open to accepting collaborations as your form as generosity. If you are a makeup artist, fashion designer make beats or music you would like to have featured on season 2, please send inquiries and submissions to babymamadrama.webseries@gmail.com</p>

<p>These days the good Reverend is the President of the notorious outlaw biker gang, The Disciples. He wields a chainsaw to get his point across. (He can also see evil on people, like a thin shadow that continually swirls around the person. Once it's on you, the shadow never leaves. Only death can save your soul.)</p>

<p>The Mad Mexican - no one knows Turnbull’s Christian name, or where he comes from, only that he arrived from South of the border. The only facts are these…his father was a half-assed wrestler in the Lucha Libre Underground known as El Baño. When he was just thirteen Turnbull was recruited into drug kingpin El Chapo’s vicious army of thugs where he developed his dislike for the bad guys surrounding him. After being forced to put his beloved pit bull “Malo el Hijo de Punta” into a dog fight, Turnbull turned the tables and before the fight concluded he had annihilated every living soul in the room, but not before his precious “de Punta” had been torn to shreds. Ever since, he has vowed to punish anyone who wrongs the innocent. In Mexico he is simply known by the moniker his trusted pooch once carried, which in English translates to “Bad Motherfucker.” </p>

It was then the monastery came under attack by the Red Army invading Nepal. He managed to escape and make his way to America where he made money by battling in underground fight clubs. Monk gained a reputation for his soft demeanor outside the ring and his request to only battle evil doers. Contrary to his impeccable fighting skills Monk detests violence of any kind, except when confronted with the darkest side of man, then he slaughters without prejudice.</p>

<p>Redtop is a true meat-eater, skull-crusher with a ferocious appetite to kick ass and never take a name . He grew up in the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y.. As a child, Redtop's parents were murdered in front of him by a couple of wise guys. In classic Redtop fashion, at only ten years old, he hunted down all those responsible and murdered them with a hand axe. His vicious nature is only outdone by his surprising kindness to those in need. He has been seen holding the door for a lady and handing out a few bucks to the homeless. On the flip side, if you're an evil dick, Redtop loves nothing more than tequila after killin' motherfuckers.</p>

<p>Cochise is a full-blooded Cherokee Indian who grew up on a reservation in Oklahoma. His father was a drunken gambler with a tendency for violence. His mother was a hard working waitress. One night in a drunken rage his father nearly beat his mother to death with a large black dildo. Without thinking, Cochise grabbed a machete and returned to the favor to his dear old dad, leaving him all but dead. The incident landed Cochise in juvy where he spent the remainder of his formative years in gladiator academy's across the Midwest. Cochise began to stand out as he developed his own brand of frontier justice - if you're a good guy, Cochise has your back, but if you prefer running' with the devil, well, then a good ol' fashioned scalping' is comin' your way, machete style.</p>

<p>Solomon King is a wolf in wolf's clothing. He's tough, cool, and calculating. Whatever good deed he may seem to do there is always an anterior motive behind it. Can't blame him though, Solomon comes from that kind of stock. His dad was President of The Death Merchants (TDM), a violent gang of sociopaths who used to run the drugs, the hookers, the whole city. His father had a rep for being brutal and two-faced, a trait that lead to his eventual murder in prison. Solomon would make his mean ol' papa proud, rising up to become Warlord of The Reapers. For a time, they ran the same way TDM did, viciously.</p>
<p>That is until Reverend Thunder and The Disciples arrived on the scene and began dispensing their own unique brand of street justice - protect the weak, punish the oppressors.</p>
<p>Much to the dismay of Solomon and The Reapers, The Disciples proved too strong. So, for the moment, The Reapers and The Disciples are in a truce. But, nothing lasts forever.</p>

<p>The heart of The Disciples, Amy took to living on the streets as a young teenager to get off the grid after using a steak knife to circumcise two thugs who raped her alcoholic, widowed mother. She sold drugs and hooked to get by, becoming a nasty little junkie with a penchant for violence. But, when she was nineteen her life would change forever when Reverend Thunder picked her up, dusted off the sewer, got her clean, and out of the life. His love and kindness awoke the sleeping sweetheart inside Amy. She is now a popular stripper with a heart of gold. She and the good Reverend are planning to start a family and buy a house at the beach - until her disappearance.</p>

<p>The Disciples tells the story of Reverend Thunder, a priest who is able to see evil. The Reverend  turned his back on God years ago when his wife and toddler daughter were killed by a hit and run. These days the good Reverend is the leader of the outlaw biker gang The Disciples, who are on a mission to clean up the city and make the streets safe again.</p>
<p>The Reverend’s descent into hell begins upon the abduction of his newly pregnant stripper girlfriend, Amy. Walking home from work late one night, Amy is abducted by two masked assailants. Being the bad ass she is, Amy escapes her captors in a cornfield only to be immediately knocked out and abducted by two redneck brothers. She then awakens in an old barn while being raped. Amy quickly frees herself and kills the two brothers with no remorse. At that moment, her original captors stand at the barn door ready to take her back. A brutal battle ensues but this time Amy does not prevail.</p>
<p>Solomon King, war lord of rival gang The Reapers, gives The Reverend Thunder a snuff film, one of his Soldiers came into possession of, in which Amy is brutally tortured and murdered. The Reverend and the rest of The Disciples mount up, hit the streets and lay waste to anyone who has any information leading to those responsible for Amy’s murder, landing them on the doorstep of a suburban home caught in the clutches of a demonic possession.  </p>
<p>This same night, something sinister has been unfolding within the walls of this cursed suburban home. The young couple currently living in the home are visited by the previous owner, Andrew, who tells a wretched story involving the vicious murder of his younger brother and several friends within the home just a few short years ago. Andrew believes these innocent teenagers were slain by a demonic entity that was in the midst of chasing down Snake, a violent outlaw from the old west who stole a secret map called The Crusader’s Key which enabled him to escape from Hell. </p>
<p>Snake’s new found freedom was quickly cut short by the demon, sending to bring him back to Hell. The map, however, was not retrieved by the evil entity, leaving it to be found by Andrew. Without the map in it’s possession the evil spirit remained, possessing whoever resides under this roof and forcing them to commit horrendous acts of violence and murder. </p>
<p>The couple disposes of Andrew and deals with a pissed demon just as The Disciples come calling. Once inside the home, The Disciples find photographic evidence of them from 1846 in the Old West with Snake. Not sure what to make of this they question the couple and learn of Snake’s adventure and how he came into possession of a magical map used by Crusaders, God’s secret army. The map, known as The Crusader’s Key, is God’s key to the universe, enabling who ever possesses it’s power the ability to travel through space, time, life, death, Heaven and even Hell. With the power the map possesses Reverend Thunder realizes The Disciples may be able to go to Hell and save Amy.</p>
<p>As the demon rears his vicious head, The Disciples discover they are trapped inside the home with no way out. They come to the conclusion the map is their only escape from this nightmare. The only problem is, you have to die for the map to work. One by one, The Disciples are taken out in gruesome fashion by this relentless demon. In the end, Reverend Thunder must battle his one of his own, who becomes possessed by the evil spirit, to defeat the unholy saint and use the map’s power to go to Hell and save the soul of Amy and The Disciples. The good Reverend digs deep to regain his faith enabling him to exorcise the demon long enough to obtain the map and slice his own throat, sending him straight into the gates of Hell.</p>
<p>With the map clutched tight in his hand, Snake rises from the ground in the Arizona Territory, circa 1846. Not far behind, The Disciples and Amy rise from the Earth. A small troop of Army Soldiers witness this terrifying spectacle. A Colonel steps up, pulls a pistol, and demands some answers. Snake snatches the pistol from the Colonel and shoots him in the face. The Disciples then take the Soldiers weapons and horses and ride off into the sunset in search of - The Crusaders.</p>

</div></div>","Reverend Thunder is a former priest who turned his back on God after his wife and toddler daughter were killed in a hit and run accident, the driver was never caught.
These days the good Reverend is the President of the notorious outlaw biker gang, The Disciples. He wields a chainsaw to get his point across. (He can also see evil on people, like a thin shadow that continually swirls around the person. Once it's on you, the shadow never leaves. Only death can save your soul.)
 

The Mad Mexican - no one knows Turnbull’s Christian name, or where he comes from, only that he arrived from South of the border. The only facts are these…his father was a half-assed wrestler in the Lucha Libre Underground known as El Baño. When he was just thirteen Turnbull was recruited into drug kingpin El Chapo’s vicious army of thugs where he developed his dislike for the bad guys surrounding him. After being forced to put his beloved pit bull “Malo el Hijo de Punta” into a dog fight, Turnbull turned the tables and before the fight concluded he had annihilated every living soul in the room, but not before his precious “de Punta” had been torn to shreds. Ever since, he has vowed to punish anyone who wrongs the innocent. In Mexico he is simply known by the moniker his trusted pooch once carried, which in English translates to “Bad Motherfucker.” 
 

As an infant, Monk was left on the doorstep of Buddhist monastery seated high atop a Himalayan Mountain. He trained in the ways of the Dalai Lama until he was a teenager. It was then the monastery came under attack by the Red Army invading Nepal. He managed to escape and make his way to America where he made money by battling in underground fight clubs. Monk gained a reputation for his soft demeanor outside the ring and his request to only battle evil doers. Contrary to his impeccable fighting skills Monk detests violence of any kind, except when confronted with the darkest side of man, then he slaughters without prejudice.
 

Redtop is a true meat-eater, skull-crusher with a ferocious appetite to kick ass and never take a name . He grew up in the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y.. As a child, Redtop's parents were murdered in front of him by a couple of wise guys. In classic Redtop fashion, at only ten years old, he hunted down all those responsible and murdered them with a hand axe. His vicious nature is only outdone by his surprising kindness to those in need. He has been seen holding the door for a lady and handing out a few bucks to the homeless. On the flip side, if you're an evil dick, Redtop loves nothing more than tequila after killin' motherfuckers.
 

Cochise is a full-blooded Cherokee Indian who grew up on a reservation in Oklahoma. His father was a drunken gambler with a tendency for violence. His mother was a hard working waitress. One night in a drunken rage his father nearly beat his mother to death with a large black dildo. Without thinking, Cochise grabbed a machete and returned to the favor to his dear old dad, leaving him all but dead. The incident landed Cochise in juvy where he spent the remainder of his formative years in gladiator academy's across the Midwest. Cochise began to stand out as he developed his own brand of frontier justice - if you're a good guy, Cochise has your back, but if you prefer running' with the devil, well, then a good ol' fashioned scalping' is comin' your way, machete style.
 

Solomon King is a wolf in wolf's clothing. He's tough, cool, and calculating. Whatever good deed he may seem to do there is always an anterior motive behind it. Can't blame him though, Solomon comes from that kind of stock. His dad was President of The Death Merchants (TDM), a violent gang of sociopaths who used to run the drugs, the hookers, the whole city. His father had a rep for being brutal and two-faced, a trait that lead to his eventual murder in prison. Solomon would make his mean ol' papa proud, rising up to become Warlord of The Reapers. For a time, they ran the same way TDM did, viciously.
That is until Reverend Thunder and The Disciples arrived on the scene and began dispensing their own unique brand of street justice - protect the weak, punish the oppressors.
Much to the dismay of Solomon and The Reapers, The Disciples proved too strong. So, for the moment, The Reapers and The Disciples are in a truce. But, nothing lasts forever.
 

The heart of The Disciples, Amy took to living on the streets as a young teenager to get off the grid after using a steak knife to circumcise two thugs who raped her alcoholic, widowed mother. She sold drugs and hooked to get by, becoming a nasty little junkie with a penchant for violence. But, when she was nineteen her life would change forever when Reverend Thunder picked her up, dusted off the sewer, got her clean, and out of the life. His love and kindness awoke the sleeping sweetheart inside Amy. She is now a popular stripper with a heart of gold. She and the good Reverend are planning to start a family and buy a house at the beach - until her disappearance.
 

The Disciples tells the story of Reverend Thunder, a priest who is able to see evil. The Reverend  turned his back on God years ago when his wife and toddler daughter were killed by a hit and run. These days the good Reverend is the leader of the outlaw biker gang The Disciples, who are on a mission to clean up the city and make the streets safe again.
The Reverend’s descent into hell begins upon the abduction of his newly pregnant stripper girlfriend, Amy. Walking home from work late one night, Amy is abducted by two masked assailants. Being the bad ass she is, Amy escapes her captors in a cornfield only to be immediately knocked out and abducted by two redneck brothers. She then awakens in an old barn while being raped. Amy quickly frees herself and kills the two brothers with no remorse. At that moment, her original captors stand at the barn door ready to take her back. A brutal battle ensues but this time Amy does not prevail.
Solomon King, war lord of rival gang The Reapers, gives The Reverend Thunder a snuff film, one of his Soldiers came into possession of, in which Amy is brutally tortured and murdered. The Reverend and the rest of The Disciples mount up, hit the streets and lay waste to anyone who has any information leading to those responsible for Amy’s murder, landing them on the doorstep of a suburban home caught in the clutches of a demonic possession.  
This same night, something sinister has been unfolding within the walls of this cursed suburban home. The young couple currently living in the home are visited by the previous owner, Andrew, who tells a wretched story involving the vicious murder of his younger brother and several friends within the home just a few short years ago. Andrew believes these innocent teenagers were slain by a demonic entity that was in the midst of chasing down Snake, a violent outlaw from the old west who stole a secret map called The Crusader’s Key which enabled him to escape from Hell. 
Snake’s new found freedom was quickly cut short by the demon, sending to bring him back to Hell. The map, however, was not retrieved by the evil entity, leaving it to be found by Andrew. Without the map in it’s possession the evil spirit remained, possessing whoever resides under this roof and forcing them to commit horrendous acts of violence and murder. 
The couple disposes of Andrew and deals with a pissed demon just as The Disciples come calling. Once inside the home, The Disciples find photographic evidence of them from 1846 in the Old West with Snake. Not sure what to make of this they question the couple and learn of Snake’s adventure and how he came into possession of a magical map used by Crusaders, God’s secret army. The map, known as The Crusader’s Key, is God’s key to the universe, enabling who ever possesses it’s power the ability to travel through space, time, life, death, Heaven and even Hell. With the power the map possesses Reverend Thunder realizes The Disciples may be able to go to Hell and save Amy.
As the demon rears his vicious head, The Disciples discover they are trapped inside the home with no way out. They come to the conclusion the map is their only escape from this nightmare. The only problem is, you have to die for the map to work. One by one, The Disciples are taken out in gruesome fashion by this relentless demon. In the end, Reverend Thunder must battle his one of his own, who becomes possessed by the evil spirit, to defeat the unholy saint and use the map’s power to go to Hell and save the soul of Amy and The Disciples. The good Reverend digs deep to regain his faith enabling him to exorcise the demon long enough to obtain the map and slice his own throat, sending him straight into the gates of Hell.
With the map clutched tight in his hand, Snake rises from the ground in the Arizona Territory, circa 1846. Not far behind, The Disciples and Amy rise from the Earth. A small troop of Army Soldiers witness this terrifying spectacle. A Colonel steps up, pulls a pistol, and demands some answers. Snake snatches the pistol from the Colonel and shoots him in the face. The Disciples then take the Soldiers weapons and horses and ride off into the sunset in search of - The Crusaders.

<h3>Bienvenido</h3>
<p>¡ Hola! Mi nombre es Francisco Retamal, más conocido por mi segundo nombre que es <strong>Alejandro</strong>.</p>
<p>Desde el año 2016 soy estudiante de Ingeniería Civil Informática, aunque las <strong>neurociencias</strong> son una de las disciplinas científicas que por estos días cada vez me están despertando más interés.</p>
<p>( <a href=""https://cientificochileno.cl/Home/certificado.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link a mi certificado de alumno</a>)</p>
<p>Pensando en <strong>cómo puedo dar dirección a este interés</strong>, es que encauzarlo desde el emprendimiento me pareció una gran idea, ya que al desarrollar investigación, tener mi propia empresa para financiarlo es lo que podría darle mayor libertad y alcance.</p>
<p><strong>Más allá de mi interés por las neurociencias, </strong>he observado un problema muy claro en Chile. He observado que mientras en otros países existen científicos popularmente reconocidos a nivel mundial como son el caso de Michio Kaku y Neil DeGrasse Tyson( que son portada de revistas, invitados a programas de televisión y protagonistas de conferencias que son documentadas en video y vistas masivamente a través de canales como YouTube o charlas TED), al igual que científicos ya fallecidos como Stephen Hawking o el mítico Carl Sagan; <strong>en nuestro país, a pesar de que tenemos científicos de talla mundial, ocurre que casi nadie los conoce</strong>.</p>
<p>Recuerdo que uno de los varios motivos por los que elegí estudiar donde estoy, fue que Eric Goles hace clases aquí. Sin embargo, desde que comencé mi carrera, de vez en cuando le pregunto a otros alumnos acaso lo conocen y <strong>me impresiona </strong>como prácticamente nadie tiene la menor idea de quién es él.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>¡ Es hora de cambiar esto!</strong></i></p>
<p>... así es como <strong>nace Científico Chileno</strong>. El proyecto de serie documental en video, asociado a un sitio web núcleo, cuyo objetivo es <strong>difundir la vida y obra</strong> de nuestros sobresalientes científicos chilenos.</p>
<p><strong>La idea original supone 2 temporadas</strong>, de las cuales <strong>la primera temporada</strong> constará de 12 capítulos de larga duración, cada uno de ellos destinado exclusivamente a revisar la vida y obra de un único científico que se desempeñe actualmente como académico en mi Universidad.</p>
<p>Esta campaña de Indiegogo está orientada a la realización de esta primera temporada.</p>
<p><strong>En mi Universidad desempeñan su labor imponentes científicos</strong> con estudios doctorales y posgrado, de vasta trayectoria y producción científica de calidad suprema. Solo por mencionar a alguno, está el caso de Eric Goles:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Eric Goles</strong>: Premio Nacional de ciencias. Puso en alto el nombre de Chile con sus aportes en Matemáticas Discretas en la Universidad de Chile. Fue conocido por ser conductor del programa Enlaces de TVN en los 90's. Ex-presidente del CONYCIT para el gobierno de Chile. Participó en la fundación del Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Valparaíso. ( enlaces externos: <a href=""https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Goles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eric Goles en wikipedia</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/YrIHfP_zwmM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eric Goles en Mentes Brillantes</a>)</li></ul>
<p>También se pueden encontrar los casos de <strong>Andrés Concha Saldias</strong>, <strong>John Anthony Atkinson</strong> o <strong>Eduardo Moreno</strong>, <strong>entre muchos otros</strong>, que han realizado aportes invaluables tanto para Chile como al mundo cada uno en su disciplina.</p>

<h3>Qué necesita el proyecto y qué obtienes al apoyarlo</h3>
<p>Debo decir que antes de crear esta campaña en Indiegogo, la decisión ya estaba tomada:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¡ La primera temporada de Científico Chileno se rodará sí o sí!</strong></p>
<p>Sin embargo, hay algunos <strong>requerimientos necesarios para darle una calidad adecuada</strong> a un proyecto audiovisual de este tipo.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:30px;color: #777;border-left:none;""><q>Actualmente dispongo de una <strong>cámara </strong>Sony Cybershot DSC-WX350 que tiene la capacidad de grabar video en Full HD y que podría ser suficiente para llevar adelante la serie. Además de una cámara GoPro y mi celular Samsung J4, con los que puedo conseguir grabaciones de similar calidad. Sin embargo, lo ideal es tener una cámara Reflex o al menos una cámara como la Sony Semiprofesional DSC-HX350 cuyo valor es aproximadamente de $250.000.</q></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30px;color: #777;border-left:none;""><q>( enlace externo: <a href=""https://aprendercine.com/michel-gondry-rueda-un-corto-con-un-iphone-7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Gondry rueda un corto con un iphone</a>)</q></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30px;color: #777;border-left:none;""><q>Más importante aún, sería <strong>tener al menos un trípode</strong> para alguna de las cámaras, que es algo relativamente barato: no más allá de $30.000.</q></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30px;color: #777;border-left:none;""><q><strong>Otros elementos técnicos relevantes</strong>, además de un par de trípodes, son una tarjeta de memoria SD( $10.000~$40.000) o un estabilizador de cámara( el Feiyutech G6 Plus cuesta alrededor de $180.000, otros pueden variar desde los más básicos como el Fantaseal o un Neewer que van entre los $15.000 a $50.000, a los electrónicos más avanzados como el Moza AirCross, Zhiyun Crane o el DJI Ronin que varían entre los $250.00 y $500.000).</q></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30px;color: #777;border-left:none;""><q>Todos estos, elementos <strong>de los cuales no dispongo en este momento</strong>.</q></p>
</div>
<p>Más adelante, al final de esta página podrás revisar los detalles relativos a todos estos elementos... <strong>pero lo más relevante y costoso, no son los elementos técnicos, sino que es el elemento humano</strong> que corresponderá a una cifra cercana al <strong>80% del presupuesto total</strong>.</p>
<p><u>El elemento humano</u></p>
<p>Durante la primera quincena de Febrero estuve recolectando información disponible en internet de algunos profesores, y algo como descargar y ordenar los papers únicamente del profesor Eduardo Moreno, <strong>es una tarea que puede demandar una día completo de trabajo</strong>. <strong>Y para qué hablar respecto a estudiar en profundidad los papers</strong>, tarea que me demandaría al menos una semana de trabajo <strong>por cada uno de los más de 12 académicos estudiados</strong>( la selección final es de 12 científicos).</p>
<p>Además de esto, entre mucha gente más, es necesario <strong>un entrevistador</strong> que tenga buena dicción y preferentemente experiencia con las cámaras, quien pretendo que sea un estudiante de la carrera de periodismo.</p>
<p>El 2018 <strong>conversé con un estudiante de periodismo </strong>que fue mi compañero en una asignatura que los ingenieros compartimos con otras carreras. Él <strong>tiene experiencia de varios años como Youtuber</strong>, y se mostró muy interesado en participar. Pero el tiempo en la Universidad es apremiante y el interés de mi compañero acarrea las dudas respectivas a este problema, en vistas de participar. Yo mismo me veré limitado al avanzar en este proyecto una vez comiencen las clases en Marzo del presente año. Así que como cualquier trabajo, <strong>remunerar el trabajo del estudiante que decida ser partícipe del proyecto será un incentivo de importancia en pos de dar profesionalismo a este</strong>.</p>

<p><i><strong><u>-&gt;&gt; Qué obtienes con tu apoyo &lt;&lt;-</u></strong></i></p>
<p>Lo primero y más relevante que obtendrás al apoyar este proyecto, será la <strong>satisfacción</strong> de estar contribuyendo a que nuestros científicos y su relevante trabajo( de calidad internacional) <strong>sean reconocidos</strong> a nivel nacional, lo cuál por sí solo ayudará a <strong>fomentar el desarrollo de la ciencia</strong> en nuestro país.</p>

<h3>El impacto</h3>
<p>Pocas personas saben la calidad e importancia del trabajo de nuestros científicos.</p>
<p>Un solo ejemplo de esto, es el desconocimiento de Cesar Hidalgo( no quiero ser repetitivo en mencionar a Eric Goles) quién es el único chileno que se ha convertido en <strong>profesor</strong> en la Universidad más importante del mundo en Ingeniería y ciencias, el <strong>MIT</strong>. Cesar Hidalgo junto a Ricardo Hausmann( Venezolano, profesor de Harvard) entre otros, <strong>crearon el ""Atlas of economic complexity""</strong>, y quién junto a su equipo del MIT desarrollaron el sitio web abierto, de mismo título, en donde se puede analizar la economía de cada país en gran detalle. Entre <strong>muchos otros desarrollos online</strong>.</p>
<p>Si bien Cesar Hidalgo no es candidato para la primera temporada que está enfocada en la Universidad en que estudio( pero lo es para la segunda), muchos otros <strong>académicos de igual relevancia para el desarrollo de Chile y la ciencia</strong>, serán conocidos por la gente.</p>
<p>Consecuentemente, <strong>el éxito de este proyecto</strong> será un éxito no solo para mí y mis proyectos futuros enfocados en la neurociencia, sino que para todo el desarrollo de la ciencia en Chile y más.</p>
<p>Nuestros científicos<strong> no solo son un aporte para el desarrollo de la ciencia en Chile sino que en el mundo</strong>. El pasado lo ha demostrado. El trabajo desarrollado en Chile ha sido no pocas veces un aporte a la ciencia a nivel mundial, y eso es lo que sabrás una vez que la serie Científico Chileno sea liberada.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Riesgos &amp; desafíos</h3>
<p>El tiempo es probablemente el bien más preciado del que disponemos. Como tal, trabajar en este proyecto será un desafío enorme a lo largo de mi año académico, pues estudiar Ingeniería Civil Informática ya es algo muy demandante.</p>
<p>Esto hace que todo el apoyo que reciba esta campaña sea tan valioso y útil para un desarrollo más efectivo y de calidad para Científico Chileno.</p>
<p>Además, es para mí un <strong>particular desafío</strong> 2 aspectos de este proyecto:</p>
<ol>
<li>Por un lado, <strong>poder retratar a cada científico</strong> y sus trabajos de manera que su relevancia pueda ser claramente percibida por el público, sin transformarlo en una serie aburrida de ver. Debe ser <strong>de interés</strong> para todo el público, tanto adultos como niños y gente pertenecientes a toda área del quehacer nacional.</li>
<li>y segundo, lograr <strong>que sea un proyecto productivamente exitoso</strong> al nivel de lograr retribuir cada peso de la ayuda entregada a través de esta campaña a cada uno de los donadores y duplicar su donación.</li>
</ol>
<p>Todo esto requerirá una <strong>continua planificación y ejecución</strong> ante cada imprevisto en el transcurso de su desarrollo. <strong>Evaluar </strong>cuidadosamente cada <strong>inversión</strong> monetaria, el plan de <strong>marketing</strong> y la <strong>calidad</strong> en cada detalle.</p>

<h3><strong>“They will pay… with rivers of blood!”</strong></h3>
<p>It may sound corny now, but if you grew up in the early 80s, those words turned every broomstick into a lethal katana. Martial Arts films dominated the American imagination, and kids everywhere devoured the canon. Many were lost to time. But one staple, one classic of the genre, kicks the most ass: Shogun Assassin. The bloodiest of them all. In humble tribute to Shogun Assassin, we warmly present WOLF, an original web series.</p>
<p>Set in present-day Las Vegas, WOLF, follows Judah WOLF, a dishonored ex-cop, searching the streets of Las Vegas with his 7-year-old daughter, Kikuyu WOLF, seeking bloody revenge on Korando Shinoda, the Yakuza boss responsible for his wife’s murder.</p>
<p>We, the producers of WOLF, want to offer a new generation a tale of revenge, loyalty, and honor. But we need bloodthirsty heroes to help!</p>
<p>We are raising $250,000 to create the highest quality web series.  You have watched the sizzle. That is just a taste of what the nine-episode series will be. Your awesome donations will go toward:</p>
<p>Nine quality episodes: 10-12 minutes each.</p>
<p>SAG Cast</p>
<p>Film Equipment</p>
<p>Set Design</p>
<p>Location Fees</p>
<p>Post Production, i.e., Editing, Sound Design, and more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>We're a Mixed Bag</strong></h3>
<p>The good folks in front of the camera look a lot like the good folks behind the camera. This series is a true melting pot. Broadcasting characters of varied races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations.  To add, our team of producers is made up of all women. </p>
<p>WOLF presents and represents a healthy American tapestry. And we welcome everyone to contribute to this series. Your love and support means more than written words can express.  </p>

<h3>WE ARE...</h3>
<p>9 Lime Films, AKA - Kris Taylor, Adrian Hadlington and Dan Hadlington.</p>
<p>A newly formed, small production team, based in North East England.</p>
<p>Last year, we produced our first short film, The Price, which was made with no budget, shot in 2 days using a compact camera, a £20 voice recorder and some home-made props. Oh, we acted in it too. If you have 4 minutes 53 seconds to spare, you can watch it here....</p>

<p>Sooooo.... </p>

<p>Our next project and the subject of this campaign SHORTCUT, is what we're dubbing a Limited, 3 Part, Micro Web Series (rolls off the tongue eh!). Episodes of 8-10 minutes each. </p>
<p>We begin shooting on April 12th 2020 (Not a lot of time but hey....schedules!)</p>
<p>The series follows Michael, an average, working class dad, who's life is changed forever when taking a shortcut home,  where he witnesses a brutal gangland murder. </p>

<p>Simply.... This is a much more ambitious project for us as new filmmakers but one we are confident about and really excited to make. So... we're looking for any assistance that allows us to suitably look after the cast (and crew... us) that have generously agreed to be part of this project i.e. food, travel expenses etc. After that, anything that helps us with other production costs would be a huge bonus. </p>
<p>We've learned a lot since making 'The Price' and we're confident the overall production value will be far greater this time around. Your contribution will go a long way to helping us achieve that and also help us create a film worthy of the story being told.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582072927/glbuf0w5svdmszitv9lb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hello. My name is <strong>Terrence Patterson</strong> (picture below) and I am the <strong>creator/writer and executive producer of the web series, Half Past Jump Time</strong>. I have been involved in the entertainment industry for 10+ years starting in theater Off Broadway as an actor/Producer.  I also trained as an actor at HB Studios but I realized I was a better producer and then I started to trust my writing instincts.  I co-produced a play, The Newlyweds, for over 100 performances and I gained experience hiring actors, writing, audition, social media campaigns, budgeting and marketing among other skills. I formed my own digital media/streaming company and my first project (I have a few in development as well) is this web series.</p>
<p>The campaign is extremely important to me (and my team) as a newly proclaimed media entrepreneur because it would mean I am on the right path. I had a ""day job"" for many years and I would like this campaign to allow my team and myself to continue to do what we love. Create compelling stories within the web series space in which we would stand out as having a high production value and interesting characters/episodes. I financed the first two episodes and it was money well spent. <strong>I personally have skin in the game, the total production costs for episodes 1 and 2 were $11K, with more funding from you we are more than committed to seeing that we produce all of the first season episodes (8 - 9 episodes).</strong> Through my experience in theater, independent film, this web series and having a mentor who has network episodic series experience we are on a solid foundation. I will make sure the contributions are spent in the right areas (mostly post-production) for us to continue producing compelling stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582032387/oet09eqmfb7tv6vkubzc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds will go toward the following:</p>
<p>1. <strong>1920s wardrobe for entire cast (5 actors)</strong> - we have identified reasonably priced websites so that the main characters and extras have wardrobe that are period appropriate.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Post production</strong> - The show is scifi based so we would need the effects to be as organic as possible with the execution that modern audiences have grown accustomed to, but within budget. I have an advisor for post-production who works for a large, international VFX firm who will assist in making sure we attain maximum value for funds raised through this campaign.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Locations</strong> - Most will be under $1000/day. Period appropriate locations are hard to find even in New York City. We will shoot multiple scenes on the same day for locations that appear in more than one episode to conserve time and production time.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Food </strong>- It is always surprisingly more than you budgeted for initially. But I have used online resources which takes a few clicks and you can appeal to many food requests from vegan to all inclusive diet all in one space. </p>
<p>5. Hiring one or two additional writers to help shape the series and to ensure all of the characters have distinctive voices and depth.</p>
<p>6. Salaries for cast/crew.</p>
<p><u><strong>Unique Perks:</strong></u></p>
<p>We have consciously created perks that we knew would get fulfill on a timely basis and that we thought would resonate with our donors.</p>
<p>A few of the Perks are:  <strong>walk-on part/background acting for NYC area residents; your photo (aged to appear from 1920s) in random scene or newspaper/magazine prop; early release of Episodes; invite to Harlem Renaissance party in NYC after production of Season 1.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582073083/dvn7bepku3rtmmf6it0z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of our show</h3>
<p>My track record, the impact of the show and unlimited potential for our web series:</p>
<p>Having successfully financed, written and produced 2 episodes of the web series and over 100 performances of an <strong>Off-Broadway play, The Newlyweds</strong> (at the Producer's Club and at the American Theater of Actors) I am fully qualified (with my outstanding team of producers and mentors) to produce high quality episodes.  I have learned from my past mistakes on set, hiring actors for the wrong parts and having to find replacement for actors who fail to show up for a performance or on set.  My past productions have truly informed me on the art of being able to be a leader through all phases of production and post-production. <strong>I can ensure that your investment will be allocated to making the best production while being mindful of where the money is spent.</strong> I have been producing since 2006 and it is the only job that I have every had that does not feel like work.  I put my all into any creative endeavor that I am apart of and I am confident that now with a team behind me that believes in the project odds are we will be successful producing the remaining episodes. We believe the show is a valuable contributor to the modern landscape of online web series. <strong>Our project stands out from the crowd and with your help you can help us spread the word to others about our amazing story and character. A sci-fi, web series with not one but two female leads is rare and extraordinary. There is a definitely an underserved market for this type of production. It is the main reason we created the show.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, our first (2) episodes of Half Past Jump Time are currently available for viewing on <strong>Facebook, Amazon Prime, Vimeo</strong> and our website (<a href=""http://www.halfpastjumptime.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.halfpastjumptime.com</a>). We are humbled by the many hours of viewing of our web series across many viewing platforms (well over 10,000 minutes). The platform with the most views is LinkedIn, which I did not see coming or expect it.  My network (comprised of film and TV professionals, actors, production designers) on LinkedIn have responded very positively about the episodes and they see the unlimited potential in how we can present the Harlem Renaissance and introduce hip-hop elements from modern day New York.  Feedback from our audience has been positive as well and we would like to continue to provide more episodes to of course retain the subscribers as well as attract new viewers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582073496/kjkrpswbjur1qywsyhil.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any production there are bound to be hurdles, unanticipated obstacles and just the unknown that can and will occur.  Some hurdles that I have encountered in the past have been locations not being available at agreed upon times, actors and crew late to set and holding up the entire production and of course going over budget.  The most important way to handle these specific challenges and others is to have as much planning/scheduling time during pre-production.  Project management skills, which I acquired at law firms in NYC, have saved me on theater and film/web series productions.  That is not to say that I will have all scenarios planned out and have action items to address them, but I will be as prepared. We are more than prepared to finish production on the remaining episodes.  Once the campaign is successful we can start dance and dialogue rehearsals.  Locations, wardrobe and the last actor have been cast for the main cast.  We are fully aware of where we want to go with the story but your investment will help get us there. Without it we will produce great episodes but with your donation and trust we can create something very special. Our audience deserves it and we want to provide interesting stories with characters that resonate well after our episodes are viewed.</p>
<p>To prepare for any of these obstacles that may arise during pre and postproduction I am being <strong>mentored by (2) very experienced producers.

My name is Terrence Patterson (picture below) and I am the creator/writer and executive producer of the web series, Half Past Jump Time. I have been involved in the entertainment industry for 10+ years starting in theater Off Broadway as an actor/Producer.  I also trained as an actor at HB Studios but I realized I was a better producer and then I started to trust my writing instincts.  I co-produced a play, The Newlyweds, for over 100 performances and I gained experience hiring actors, writing, audition, social media campaigns, budgeting and marketing among other skills. I formed my own digital media/streaming company and my first project (I have a few in development as well) is this web series.
The campaign is extremely important to me (and my team) as a newly proclaimed media entrepreneur because it would mean I am on the right path. I had a ""day job"" for many years and I would like this campaign to allow my team and myself to continue to do what we love. Create compelling stories within the web series space in which we would stand out as having a high production value and interesting characters/episodes. I financed the first two episodes and it was money well spent. I personally have skin in the game, the total production costs for episodes 1 and 2 were $11K, with more funding from you we are more than committed to seeing that we produce all of the first season episodes (8 - 9 episodes). Through my experience in theater, independent film, this web series and having a mentor who has network episodic series experience we are on a solid foundation. I will make sure the contributions are spent in the right areas (mostly post-production) for us to continue producing compelling stories.
 


What We Need & What You Get
The funds will go toward the following:
1. 1920s wardrobe for entire cast (5 actors) - we have identified reasonably priced websites so that the main characters and extras have wardrobe that are period appropriate.
2. Post production - The show is scifi based so we would need the effects to be as organic as possible with the execution that modern audiences have grown accustomed to, but within budget. I have an advisor for post-production who works for a large, international VFX firm who will assist in making sure we attain maximum value for funds raised through this campaign.
3. Locations - Most will be under $1000/day. Period appropriate locations are hard to find even in New York City. We will shoot multiple scenes on the same day for locations that appear in more than one episode to conserve time and production time.
4. Food - It is always surprisingly more than you budgeted for initially. But I have used online resources which takes a few clicks and you can appeal to many food requests from vegan to all inclusive diet all in one space. 
5. Hiring one or two additional writers to help shape the series and to ensure all of the characters have distinctive voices and depth.
6. Salaries for cast/crew.
Unique Perks:
We have consciously created perks that we knew would get fulfill on a timely basis and that we thought would resonate with our donors.
A few of the Perks are:  walk-on part/background acting for NYC area residents; your photo (aged to appear from 1920s) in random scene or newspaper/magazine prop; early release of Episodes; invite to Harlem Renaissance party in NYC after production of Season 1.


The Impact of our show
My track record, the impact of the show and unlimited potential for our web series:
Having successfully financed, written and produced 2 episodes of the web series and over 100 performances of an Off-Broadway play, The Newlyweds (at the Producer's Club and at the American Theater of Actors) I am fully qualified (with my outstanding team of producers and mentors) to produce high quality episodes.  I have learned from my past mistakes on set, hiring actors for the wrong parts and having to find replacement for actors who fail to show up for a performance or on set.  My past productions have truly informed me on the art of being able to be a leader through all phases of production and post-production. I can ensure that your investment will be allocated to making the best production while being mindful of where the money is spent. I have been producing since 2006 and it is the only job that I have every had that does not feel like work.  I put my all into any creative endeavor that I am apart of and I am confident that now with a team behind me that believes in the project odds are we will be successful producing the remaining episodes. We believe the show is a valuable contributor to the modern landscape of online web series. Our project stands out from the crowd and with your help you can help us spread the word to others about our amazing story and character. A sci-fi, web series with not one but two female leads is rare and extraordinary. There is a definitely an underserved market for this type of production. It is the main reason we created the show.
In addition, our first (2) episodes of Half Past Jump Time are currently available for viewing on Facebook, Amazon Prime, Vimeo and our website (www.halfpastjumptime.com). We are humbled by the many hours of viewing of our web series across many viewing platforms (well over 10,000 minutes). The platform with the most views is LinkedIn, which I did not see coming or expect it.  My network (comprised of film and TV professionals, actors, production designers) on LinkedIn have responded very positively about the episodes and they see the unlimited potential in how we can present the Harlem Renaissance and introduce hip-hop elements from modern day New York.  Feedback from our audience has been positive as well and we would like to continue to provide more episodes to of course retain the subscribers as well as attract new viewers.


Risks & Challenges
With any production there are bound to be hurdles, unanticipated obstacles and just the unknown that can and will occur.  Some hurdles that I have encountered in the past have been locations not being available at agreed upon times, actors and crew late to set and holding up the entire production and of course going over budget.  The most important way to handle these specific challenges and others is to have as much planning/scheduling time during pre-production.  Project management skills, which I acquired at law firms in NYC, have saved me on theater and film/web series productions.  That is not to say that I will have all scenarios planned out and have action items to address them, but I will be as prepared. We are more than prepared to finish production on the remaining episodes.  Once the campaign is successful we can start dance and dialogue rehearsals.  Locations, wardrobe and the last actor have been cast for the main cast.  We are fully aware of where we want to go with the story but your investment will help get us there. Without it we will produce great episodes but with your donation and trust we can create something very special. Our audience deserves it and we want to provide interesting stories with characters that resonate well after our episodes are viewed.
To prepare for any of these obstacles that may arise during pre and postproduction I am being mentored by (2) very experienced producers. One has a background in TV network episodic material and the other has many years of experience film production at an international VFX shop. In addition to their advisory roles I have a background as a Producer for over 10 years, so I have a solid plan to achieve the highest quality production based on our budget.  Having gained valuable experience producing Off-Broadway theater, independent film and this web series I know that I am in a great space to make my team proud.  We have an outstanding choreographer (he also is an actor in the show) so that dance portion of the show will be on point. The cast are experienced actors/dancers and from the first (2) episodes you can see the potential of where we can take their storyline.
Other Ways You Can HelpWhat you can do to help outside of donations/investing:If you are a fan of female driven, sci-fi action adventures please help us get the word out about this unique and compelling show.  The show is definitely going to explore the lives of New Yorkers in the Harlem Renaissance and juxtapose that against the lives of contemporary New Yorkers. With hip hop dancing thrown in for good measure I think we can agree that we are off to a great start. You have to be intrigued at this point and you can appreciate the potential of this show and its important as a web series.  We will provide all of our social media names/handles so that you can further spread the word on this new and unique show.  Remember Indiegogo has its own sharing tools that help facilitate putting our show on the radar for people to view on their phone/laptops/televisions.  Without your assistance in sharing to your friends, coworkers, ex-coworkers, friends in film, actor friends, family we have to stretch our marketing dollars to the maximum.  Your involvement is crucial in spreading the word as you are apart of the audience so your perspective is valued to your friends and family. It takes just a few seconds to share and you will help my team and for me as an entrepreneur I welcome any fan-based marketing of our production.Social Media Links:Facebook: @halfpastjumptimeYouTube:  Paragon Multimedia TV channelTwitter: @HalfWebInstagram: hpjt_thewebseriesPinterest: Half Past TEAM:Director:  Jingjing TianJingjing Tian is a Sundance Writer's Lab and Sundance Sloan Foundation semifinalist.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About The Resistocrats</strong></h3>
<p>In 2018, late night host Stephen Colbert shoved yet another anti-POTUS offering down America’s cultural gullet with the launch of “Our Cartoon President” on the Comedy Central network.  Out of revulsion to this, The Resistocrats was born.</p>
<p>What happens when a bitter bunch of celebrities and Hollywood has-beens<br/>band together to undermine the leader of the free world?</p>
<p>The Resistocrats is an animated cartoon in the American satirical tradition that takes aim at the current crop of hard-left Hollywood hysterics and establishment media mouthpieces who can’t seem to get over the last election, and who rail daily for a coup de grace to the current administration.</p>
<p>The Resistocrats are driven by their seething contempt for alternative leadership and American prosperity, and are willing to do anything in their pulpit power to not make America great again. But despite all their rage, they are still just brats on a stage.</p>
<p>The Resistocrats features a revolving cast of mass-media malcontents and<br/>tantrum-prone turncoats from across the worlds of entertainment and fake news!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">MEET YOUR STAR, STEPHEN COLBORE:</h3>
<p>Superiorific. Sarcastuous. Snedgy. As the host of TV’s “The Lame Show”, STEPHEN coats his comedy with more spin than a Chinese wind farm. Under the watchful eyes of the secretive Mr. and Mrs. “C”, Stephen organizes a crack unit of crazed celebrity operatives dedicated to resisting the “regime” at any cost.</p>

</div></div>","About The Resistocrats
In 2018, late night host Stephen Colbert shoved yet another anti-POTUS offering down America’s cultural gullet with the launch of “Our Cartoon President” on the Comedy Central network.  Out of revulsion to this, The Resistocrats was born.
What happens when a bitter bunch of celebrities and Hollywood has-beensband together to undermine the leader of the free world?
The Resistocrats is an animated cartoon in the American satirical tradition that takes aim at the current crop of hard-left Hollywood hysterics and establishment media mouthpieces who can’t seem to get over the last election, and who rail daily for a coup de grace to the current administration.
The Resistocrats are driven by their seething contempt for alternative leadership and American prosperity, and are willing to do anything in their pulpit power to not make America great again. But despite all their rage, they are still just brats on a stage.
The Resistocrats features a revolving cast of mass-media malcontents andtantrum-prone turncoats from across the worlds of entertainment and fake news!
 
MEET YOUR STAR, STEPHEN COLBORE:
Superiorific. Sarcastuous. Snedgy. As the host of TV’s “The Lame Show”, STEPHEN coats his comedy with more spin than a Chinese wind farm. Under the watchful eyes of the secretive Mr. and Mrs. “C”, Stephen organizes a crack unit of crazed celebrity operatives dedicated to resisting the “regime” at any cost.
 
Why We're Doing This
This series is the most creative way we could think of to express our first amendment rights, protest hellish Hollywood and the monstrous mainstream media, and have some laughs while doing it. They beg for ridicule and we’re here to dish it out.
Hollywood thinks it has the entertainment market cornered. Wrong!
Main Stream Media thinks the American people will buy their lies: Wrong!
Entertainment gutter rats think they should lord over us? :Wrong!
We invite any and all liberty-loving brothers and sisters to join us on this adventure. We're going to have a great time!
A SAMPLING OF OUR CAST OF CHARACTERS:

 

Get Excited!
Tech has changed the way audiences consume entertainment. We are currently experiencing a renaissance within the entertainment industry and we’re no longer bound to the swamp of “the business” to produce a high quality show. There’s no creepy couch cushion crawling execs to please and we can bring our much needed comedy series directly to its deplorable audience. You! By supporting this campaign you not only help us create something truly hilarious, you get to help build a nuke aimed at the MSM and armed with our most potent weapon, ridicule.
OVERSIZE COLLECTOR'S CARDS (3"" x 4"")

What's in it for You?
Besides helping us jam a thumb into the eye of the swamp, your donation will score you some really fun stuff! Imagine the look of shock on your annoyingly Anti-Trump Aunts face when she sees the animated you, smashing a trash can or sporting a pink p***y hat in our hilarious pilot.

<h3>In Short I need your help:</h3>
<p>I need your support to be able to do this both financially to get the project off the ground and then in watching the videos and giving feedback. There will also be a patreon account set up to help continue the project once it is up and running, but you do not need to be part of that if you don't want to.</p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>A reasonably good digital video camera that will enable us to film at events.</li>
<li>Licence for the better video editing software!</li>
<li>Some items to review!</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>We will not change the face of larp, that is not our aim.</p>
<p>What we will do is show you honestly and openly what kits and costume is like before you buy it online. So that you as the buyer can make an informed decision on what you will be buying before you part with your hard earned cash,</p>
<p>We will also interview makers and retailers so that you know who you are buying from.</p>
<p>We will attend events and report on their organisation and style of play.</p>
<p>We will provide simple how to videos from every thing from how to put your tent up to ordering a bespoke item of kit. </p>
<p>We are not chasing sponsorship for makers or retailers we will be independent funded by larpers for larpers.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>The challenges are that there is so much kit and costume to review.</p>
<p>Swords, armour, makers, tents, sellers, costume, boots... arghhhhh so much.... and thats before we get to events that clash!</p>
<p>I must also point out that there is a chance this will all fall flat on it's arse if no one watches the videos. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><ul>
<li>There will be a patreon link so that you can help fund the project month by month by donating a small amount.</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">All About Masterclasse</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Who's behind MasterClasse</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We're a group of film students</strong> based in Milan. After a series of short film we self-funded this project out of sheer passion producing the first three episodes with the help of young professionals.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign is very important</strong> for us: it will make the difference between stopping here and keeping on making episodes. We have a lot of ideas and our dynamic team of writers is already at work on the scripts for the next trailers. All we need to go on is you.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Where does the funding go?</strong><br/> </h3>
<p><strong>As much as we would like to flee to Mexico</strong>, we just care too much about this project. That’s why we need to gather 2000 euros to produce the next episodes: one in particular will be set in the beautiful mountains of Bergamo in Italy, and we intend to increase the quality as each episode comes out. This means more lighting, more publicity and more perks!</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of perks</strong>, we are thrilled to have you as a part of the MasterClasse family, and by donating you’ll be able to choose different options, from personal “Thank yous” up to actual cameos in the episodes themselves!</p>
<p><strong>If we won’t reach the entire goal</strong>, your help won’t be wasted! Depending on the amount, we’ll rewrite the episodes or only produce one of them, in full glory, using your precious help.</p>
<p>But it doesn't end here - keep an eye on the campaign to get to know us and learn everything about Masterclasse!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>History's Deadliest Gunfighter is a fun, provocative project that will pit old and new rivals against each other to determine who was the fastest gun in the old west. </p>
<p>I'm producer/writer Michael Anthony Giudicissi. This project is my brainchild and will appeal to anyone with an interest in the old west, as well as those who ask ""What if"" these legends had one more day to settle their scores!</p>
<p>I've worked on casting some great re-enactors in these key roles, and have already worked with many of them in their own episode of ""One Day Only"". They are historians of the characters they portray and bring unique insight to the role. What would happen if Pat Garrett came back from the grave in 2019 and face off against Billy the Kid one more time? We're going to show you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm raising money for my production and post production budget. This project is slated for release on Amazon Prime Video when completed as a 90 minute special. There is always the possibility that it might be picked up by another network prior to release. </p>
<p>The money raised will ALL go to paying actors and crew, paying for insurance and site fees for the production, set catering, as well as final editing prior to release. As the producer, writer, and host of the show I will not be using any of this money for myself or my contributions to the project. </p>
<p>I would like to raise $5000.00 which will be enough for us to shoot for 2 days in May of 2019. Any excess raised over that amount will go into set dressing, props, and post production costs to bring you the absolute highest quality film possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a HUGE community of old west re-enactors who live and breathe to watch projects like this. With high profile characters like Billy the Kid and Jesse James, this project will also appeal to anyone with a passing interest in the old west, outlaws, or lawmen. Your contribution will help bring fun, provocative entertainment to the masses via Amazon Prime Video (or other distribution channels). YOU will help answer the questions that people STILL argue over. Finally, you'll help create film jobs for cast and crew from NM, TX, and AZ. </p>
<p>I have produced short films, web series, a TV pilot, and have 2 feature films in pre production. I'm an insanely hard worker on these projects and love seeing them come to life. Thank you for being a part of it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of our casting is already done. We have also secured our filming location and I have my crew reserved. There is little standing in the way of moving into production once we raise our budget. Of course, there could be issues that would prevent or delay our filming (illness, actor scheduling, unforeseen act of God come to mind) but I intend to film this special this year and have it released by Fall of 2019, so outside of any major unforeseen incident filming is scheduled to be a GO!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While we'd LOVE if you could contribute and help bring this project to TV, we understand not everyone is able to. We can always use people to spread the word to friends and via social media. We are also seeking corporate sponsors that might fit the genre of this show (Colt Firearms, Wrangler, Cavenders, to name a few) so if you have contacts at any company that serves a western audience, an introduction would be AMAZING! Aside from that, there may be things helpful to my production that I haven't even thought of....so if you can see something I missed, please contact me!</p>

<p>The Charity Shop</p>
<p>As this is will be our last production we ever make at westminster we would like to go out with a bang. We've spent time writing a great script that we're all extremely proud of and are working hard in order to do it justice. It's a great idea, a great concept and really showcases who we've become throughout our three year degree. Together we have made a number of productions but none like this. With your help we are guaranteed to make this dream a reality. Any donation is a step towards achieving our goal so if you can and if you believe in us as much as we believe in ourselves then please help us get there. Please help us make this production look as authentic and professional as it possibly can.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise £500 to cover the cost of our actors and extras travel, printing, refreshments for cast and supporting cast, costumes, props and set design.<br/>Depending on the amount you donate, contributors will receive a credited thanks at the end of our programme, a digital 'The Charity Shop' poster signed by the writers and cast, behind the scenes digital images.</p>
<p><br/>What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal. All funds will go towards as much as we can cover. We will prioritise actors expenses, set design and contributors rewards.</p>
<p>We have made a number of projects over the course of our three year degree including documentaries, adverts and multi-camera shows. All of which can be viewed on our universities vimeo page. Please search for University of Westminster on vimeo if you would like to see what we have created so far. Our course is also known for winning a number of awards at events such as the Royal Television Society Student Awards.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>We are really hoping to reach our entire goal. However, it is well known that many do not have a lot of faith in student projects and because of this students can sometimes struggle to create a professional piece of work. <br/>We have anticipated this and there for are only raising as much money as we need in order to make our show a success. Just because we are students doesn't mean that we are less capable of creating something great and worth backing. We are talented and hard working and work just as hard as people in the industry. Sometimes even harder as we have less resources and less access. Our actors that we have auditioned fantastic and will really help to drive this production.<br/><br/>As a precaution we have tried to fundraise within the university through bake sales. However, this only raised enough money to cover the cost of paint and wallpaper.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are just starting out as a production company therefore we are a little short on funds. We need to be able to compensate the people who we have hired to help us with this project as well as the actors who are not a part of our company. (All of us who are a part of 2ndTeam are working for free on this)</p>
<p>Please help us pay our hired help AND also feed people on set so they don't turn into zombies and try to eat us (or worse....quit). We have crunched the numbers and $3,000 should be enough to pay people, feed people and also rent additional equipment we need for our set that we don't already have (some fancy lenses, and a few lights). You are pretty much saving our lives (from the potential zombie actors). No pressure.     ;P</p>
<p>Below is SOME of what you get from us in return (look to the right for the FULL LIST OF PERKS!!!)</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 gets you an autographed cast photo and a THANK YOU shoutout in the credits! </li>
<li>$50 gets you previous perks and a kick ass show poster</li>
<li>$500 gets you a date with Sticky...cuz we all need a date with a Sticky plus all previous perks</li>
<li>$1,000 gets you a VIP pass to be on the set of One Strange Happy to watch the behind the scenes operation, and a meeting with the writers to collaborate with them in writing a joke for the show! Pretty sweet! You will definitely be in the credits!</li>
<li>$3,500 gets you all previous perks plus some other stuff (we will talk and you will be very pleased just saying)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important to us mainly because of who we are. <strong>We are a group of multi-talented and diverse in ethnicity and gender individuals who are passionate about storytelling using film</strong>. We are stretching our wings so to speak with this production and solidifying our ability to work as a team. If this project goes well, we have a few other projects lined up (<i>with funding already in place</i>) that we will be producing in the Portland, OR area. We are representing <u>underrepresented talented people</u> in the Portland film market and with your help in making this project a reality, we will be able to make sure our hard work pays off and this project is completed! Our overall goal as a production team is to change the world, one film at a time by the way that we work, who we are and the type of content we create (by highlighting strong female roles and people of color).</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there. My name is Marc Lovallo, and I’m the creator of a series I'm developing called Anytown. Thank you for taking the time to look at my campaign.</p>
<p>When coming up with the idea for Anytown, I originally thought of it as just an excuse to do whatever I want (it’s where the “Any” in Anytown comes from). Then it became much more grounded and autobiographical as I started incorporating aspects of my life into the show, such as people I’ve met, places I’ve been to, and the fact that the show takes place in New Jersey.</p>
<p>I’ve been developing Anytown for two years now. I already have a great voice cast, I’m storyboarding the pilot episode right now, and I feel like the show could become something really special. So this campaign represents my passion and drive to make Anytown a reality.</p>
<p>Once the pilot is finished, I plan on uploading it to YouTube and possibly pitch it to certain networks. I also intend to partially fund the pilot myself, but with your help, I can find the talent needed to bring it to life. Something like this is going to be difficult for someone like me to do by myself, so your support would be greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>My basic goal is to raise $5000 solely to fund the pilot. The money raised from this campaign goes straight into paying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art and animation directors to help define the show's overall look</li>
<li>Animators to animate the episode</li>
<li>Artists to paint the backgrounds</li>
<li>The voice actors for providing the characters' voices</li>
</ul>
<p>Any contributions you make won't go unnoticed. Depending on how much you donate, you can earn exclusive rewards like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printed Anytown posters</li>
<li>A digital copy of the episode's script</li>
<li>Having your name listed in the credits of the episode</li>
<li>A version of the episode with an exclusive commentary track</li>
<li>A chance to see the episode before it comes out</li>
<li>A chance to make an appearance in the episode</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also a chance where I won't be able to reach my goal. So if this happens, I will save up more of my own money to put into the remainder of the budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Anytown is a project that I am incredibly passionate about for many reasons. I never had the biggest amount of confidence in myself. There have been times where I would get depressed about things, and I know several people that go through the same struggles. I've made contributions to popular web cartoons such as Eddsworld, and I've posted my own artwork online that's left a positive influence on tons of people. It's been incredibly humbling and overwhelming for me to be in a position like this, so I want to use Anytown as a means of bringing joy and happiness to people of all ages.</p>
<p>Even though Anytown will primarily appeal to kids, I want to use it to convey endearing morals and tackle certain subjects that I feel need to be addressed. I already have episodes planned that talk about prejudice, xenophobia, being in a long distance relationship, sexual identity, dealing with the death of a family member, feminism, the dangers of the internet, and too many others to list here. I don't want to do this to get my show trending on social media. I genuinely care about topics like the ones I just brought up, and I want to help kids and young adults that are going through trouble times related to those topics get through them a little easier and more comfortably.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to this campaign directly, any other support you can give would still be appreciated. Feel free to spread the word on social media, and share this around as much as you can.</p>
<p>But anyway, thanks for taking the time to look at my IndieGogo campaign. Feel free to donate if you're able to, and have a wonderful day!</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Eric Alexander has just changed his life from a famous murder-mystery writer to a creative writing professor. The peacefulness of his new environment seems broken when a series of seemingly unrelated murders occur in the surrounding areas. The last thing he needed now, getting reeled into the cases, happens shortly after, when his assistant's brother becomes the latest victim of this killing spree.</p>
<h3>The Director</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Originally from Costa Rica, Angie Loveday is a senior film student at Seton Hall University. She has had experience in production through PirateTV and as an assistant editor for Sundance-winning director, Michael Rossato-Bennett. Her short film ""Do Not Press the Red Button"" was featured as part of the 2018 SOMA Film Festival and special projects in video production have also earned her the Japanese Digital Storytelling Award two years in a row. </p>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""I found inspiration for the characters in Machiavellian while watching the Korean Drama ‘Voice’. I loved some of the psychopathic villains shown and it gave me the idea for Eric Alexander, a charismatic lead who is secretly evil, and for Anne, a girl who when thrown into a situation becomes maniacal and will not stop at anything to get what she wants. Right after finishing ‘Voice’, I watched a non-comedic web series and I was so disappointed in the lack of plot that it made me want to challenge that style. I want to create a web series with a deeper plot than the ones I had seen so far. With this in mind, I have been developing Machiavellian. Like Voice, Machiavellian is a crime drama but developed over a short course of time. A short length web series containing complex plot elements is my goal.""</p>
<h3>What will the funds be used for?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The funds collected through this campaign will be used for the following:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>1. Lead actors casting. </strong>To have a great performance we need a solid cast. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>2. Music acquisition. </strong>Part of what makes a production great is the soundtrack behind it. There are several artists that we have in mind and we want to compensate them accordingly for their work.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>3. Feeding the crew. </strong>One of the most important lessons we have learned in production is that a hungry crew does not work. Keep the crew happy and you'll have great results.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Production is a long and arduous process. We want everyone who helps us make Machiavellian to stay in touch and anticipate its official release. If you become a contributor, there are several perks that you will receive during, and after production. We will keep you constantly updated about Machiavellian's status and what is happening. Our goal is not only to produce the series but also for everyone to enjoy the finalized product.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Milwaukee is full of extremely talented film and theater artists, yet this is not yet widely known, or taken advantage of in larger creative circles. The goal of this project is to create an ensemble-cast show, that will shine light on some of these artists and draw attention to the unique and excellent creative community in Milwaukee. We are entertainment pros, workers, students, teachers, parents, and neighbors, coming together with a common vision to elevate each other to higher levels of production expertise. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any project, there are chances of it falling through. Scheduling issues, weather, lack of funds, etc. all pose some risk for the project.

<p>We are a team based in New York City in need of help to fund the continuation of our indie comedy television series, <i><strong>FREETOWN TO FLATBUSH</strong></i>.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Karla Conteh is lieutenant of a Woman’s militia organized by her mother to maintain Wildlife Protection...she hunts poachers. And pretty damn good at it. Her parents sent her sister Tamara directly after elementary school to go live in Brooklyn.  Karla is unaware that Tamara has been living what their parents would think is “A Reckless Life”. She manages to convince her mother to allow her to go visit her sister in America to assist in getting her life straight. </p>

<p><strong>HISTORY:</strong></p>
<p>Freetown To Flatbush was first conceptualized in the spring of 2020. Keef Louda <i>(Creator/ Director)</i> originally wanted to tell a story of Black Women from different backgrounds coming up together in Brooklyn, NY.  While researching for different backgrounds to the characters he also saw there was a lack of African representation in television and media at a time the continent needed a voice in America and decided to make it a fish out of water story for an African girl. That's when he decided to team up with Fionia Amara, a Sierra Leonean-American <i>(Actress, Executive Producer)</i>, to tie in Freetown. Fionia has since helped attract contributors also from Sierra Leone to our cause. In June we developed our first script and began casting throughout August. Shawn Gooden<i> (Co-Writer, Comedian)</i> was brought in as writer during the finalization of the script and  wrote all our Narrative work for our Lead. Since then she's assisted with the actresses on set in delivering comedic lines and has proceeded as Co-Writer in helping us conceive episodes 2 through 6 of Season One.  Freetown To Flatbush has the balance of being a comedy about a group of Friends that lends itself to a African Soap Opera.  The layered story of what it's like being a Black Woman in American society and how unification is our greatest Asset everywhere, while pushing the limits of what's ""Allowed"" from Black Women on Television.</p>

<p>In October of 2020 we filmed Our Pilot Episode with a budget mostly funded by Fionia Amara and Slate Reel LLC and A LOT of hard work from our small cast and crew. We were successfully able to wrap in December 2020. Despite the given times, we had so much fun bringing this story to life. Our cast and crew remained healthy during and after shooting as we made sure to film under the Covid Protocol for film sets. We are currently on the market looking to be picked up and funded by a Major Network. We understand getting picked up by a major network can sometimes take awhile. Our plan is to try and raise as much funding as we possibly can to continue making the show with full creative agency if the projected time frame isn't met.  We will then continue to film Episodes 2 through 6 ourselves with the help of other paid professionals and possibly YOU!  </p>
<p>Our Pilot is currently in Post Production!</p>

</div><div>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>As many of you may know, it’s hard for young, Black and/or female, independent filmmakers to get their voices heard. We’d love to continue making the show with full creative control meaning our vision remains that of the Directors and Production Staff.  We are looking to raise money for all necessary production needs for Episodes 2 through 6 Including a possible trip to Africa for our Season One conclusion.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>$50,000</strong> -  Pays Actors &amp; Crew such as Lighting &amp; Sound; Location Costs;  Equipment Costs; Transportation; Craft Services; Wardrobes &amp; Props; and  Post Production (Editing; Coloring; Sound Mix) and Legal/Licensing Fees for 5 Episodes.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Funding Stretch Goals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50,000</strong> - Home base! This will allow us to cover all of our production AND post-production costs and ensures that production can run smoothly.  </p>
<p><strong>$75,000</strong> - I'm on A New Level! This will allow us an added layer of financial comfort on-set in case anything in production goes awry (as it inevitably does!) It also means that we can take more creative risk and rent some additional equipment that will make our episodes look even better. We'd also have a budget to work with for marketing the series as a whole afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>$100,000</strong> - The Dream! This will allow us to go above and beyond on all of our production and post needs, therefore elevating our episodes across the board. This will also allow us to explore our marketing options even more. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, fans! Hopefully, if you're taking the time to read this you know who we are and more importantly, you enjoyed our award-winning cinematic fan film, The Black League of Superheroes!  Well, what you saw was part 2 of a trilogy, and to complete the story we need funding that will allow for the first and third chapters to be completed at the level that it deserves.  Everyone who contributes to this project will be credited in the film!  </p>
<p>The Black League of Superheroes was a labor of love and entirely self-funded starting out as a simple one-day shoot with a single camera, a single Actor, and a BIG idea.  The project only began to grow from there until it got a life of its own and a one-person show ended up becoming a modestly budgeted ensemble cast fan film which is now a multiple festival award-winner! </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>So where do you come in? Well, it's simple, filming is not cheap, and as wonderful as it was to introduce the Black League to you for free, doing it a second and third time on an even bigger budget would downright be insane.  So we're hoping that what we've done was strong enough to inspire you to contribute towards the completion of our next chapter.  Part 1, titled Black Son of Krypton will offer a dramatic and powerful origin story of The Black League's founder Superman/Jal El bringing us right to the moments that take place in the sequel.  </p>
<p>So what's in it for you? Other than getting to see the full vision of this story in its entirety and receiving you also will receive additional benefits depending on how big of a contribution you're willing to make! But before we get there, let's start with what it will cost to fund this film.  We're seeking a total budget of $12,000 which is extremely modest for a film but with our 20+ years of experience, resources, and filmmaking savvy, it will be enough to make it happen.  What will that cost cover?  A 20-25 minute cinema-quality part 1 origin tale of Jal-El aka Superman who was introduced in The Black League of Superman.  The money will pay for the following:</p>
<p>-Set Locations ($1500)- Jim Logan Studios will be used for Watchtower scenes/Jal El's home and on-location filming will be needed for primary scenes including a Church exterior.    </p>
<p>-Actor Pay- 9 total ($2000)-Visit our IMDB page for our current cast list:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt14616296/reference"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt14616296/reference</a></p>
<p>-Cinematography ($2500)- Returning Director Steven Alan Davis along with In Reel Time Productions for drone/action shots </p>
<p>-Costumes/Make-Up ($2500)- Costumes/Masks by REEVFX/Pro Cosplay</p>
<p>-Post Production ($3500)- Q-Logic Entertainment, the cinema wizards behind the success of The Black League of Superheroes </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you've watched The Black League of Superheroes you know that it is more than a standard fare fan film, but a story with a deep-rooted message. Let's take a look at a synopsis of Black Son of Krypton: </p>
<p>In 1955, 2 Kryptonians landed on Earth from the doomed planet Krypton.  One, the world knows, the other has been hidden by choice.  Jal-El, The Black Son of Krypton had a very different experience on Earth.  A Kryptonian with the complexion of an African American, he was raised in the Jim Crow era to know that revealing his abilities could prove a death sentence for his family and loved ones.  In 2017, Kal-El Superman visits a now-adult Jal El in an effort to have him finally take up the mantle and join the battle against modern-day evils.  Is it too late or will Jal-El finally become the hero he was meant to be?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are very few risks as pre-production is intended to map out a very strategic and realistic method of completing the film.  The first film was able to be shot in a total of 4 days, The Black Son of Krypton will take about the same. Once shooting is completed we will immediately jump into post-production with our uber-talented team Q-Logic Entertainment who will help convert footage into a masterpiece of a film as they did for the award-winning Black League of Superheroes.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are so many ways that you can help even if you can't financially contribute.  Sharing this campaign, sharing direct links to our official website <a href=""http://www.blackleagueofsuperheroes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blackleagueofsuperheroes.com</a> and YouTube channel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VsEIaB6fGUrTlnU8JDiPQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VsEIaB6fGUrTlnU8JDiPQ</a> and simply staying engaged with our ongoing progress, following our social media including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok and just liking/loving/reposting/commenting and giving encouragement for the production team as well as the fans who will be looking forward to seeing the finished product along with you!  </p>

<h3>WHAT'S MY STORY?</h3>
<p>At the young age of fourteen, something was ignited inside of me upon reading about the unjust killing of an 18 year old black boy named Michael Brown. Ever since that day, making a change in the world and being an inspiration became my number one goal.<br/>I have been making videos for as long as I can remember. From evolving from my Grandfather's camcorder to my first DSLR, making videos has always been my favorite outlet to translate my feelings and share my thoughts with the world. Growing up in the age of technology has been beyond a blessing.<br/>One day, I decided to combine these passions together and Brewing Taboos was born. Brewing Taboos is my one-woman web show in which I discuss politics, social justice, and pop culture predominately in the Black community. My intention with this web show is to create a spark in as many minds as possible and encourage people to challenge everything they're taught. I want to inspire as many people as possible to be the change they wish to see in the world, and to be a teacher, a leader, and a light.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?</h3>
<p>Making a change in the world is a project that is much bigger than me. I need your help. I have set a small goal of $1,000 for this campaign.

At the young age of fourteen, something was ignited inside of me upon reading about the unjust killing of an 18 year old black boy named Michael Brown. Ever since that day, making a change in the world and being an inspiration became my number one goal.I have been making videos for as long as I can remember. From evolving from my Grandfather's camcorder to my first DSLR, making videos has always been my favorite outlet to translate my feelings and share my thoughts with the world. Growing up in the age of technology has been beyond a blessing.One day, I decided to combine these passions together and Brewing Taboos was born. Brewing Taboos is my one-woman web show in which I discuss politics, social justice, and pop culture predominately in the Black community. My intention with this web show is to create a spark in as many minds as possible and encourage people to challenge everything they're taught. I want to inspire as many people as possible to be the change they wish to see in the world, and to be a teacher, a leader, and a light.
