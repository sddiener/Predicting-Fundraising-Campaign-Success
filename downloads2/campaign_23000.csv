Salt Lake City, Utah (PRWEB) September 29, 2013


Will Utah Embrace Its Newest Theater Company—Utah Repertory Theater Company?
Utah Repertory Theater Company, hailed as “the most exciting up-and-coming theater company in the state” by Broadway World, approaches its first-year anniversary. But will the company see a second season, or will this non-profit company be a flash in the pan, following the pattern of many theater companies closing after their first year?
“I founded Utah Repertory Theater Company as a way to bring high-quality, though seldom-produced, plays and musicals to the state. There is so much talent in Utah, but much of this talent is forced to leave the state to find work,” said Johnny Hebda, the company’s founder and member of the company’s executive board. “Also, I was tired of seeing the same 15 to 20 shows recycled throughout the state year after year. There are many amazing shows with important messages that need to be shared in the state. Theater has always had the power to shape people’s thinking and open people’s eyes to others’ lives and struggles.”
During its first season, the company has produced shows at several different theater venues and employed some of Utah’s most talented performers and artists, from Spanish Fork to Ogden.
Utah Repertory Theater Company, commonly referred to as Utah Rep, took on a very ambitious season, debuting with the musical SIDE SHOW. The company has since presented Utah audiences with five full-length productions, four of which have been Utah premieres. The season has included I LOVE YOU BECAUSE, WHAT THE BELLHOP SAW, Rodgers and Hammerstein’s CAROUSEL, and currently in production, Jonathan Larson’s RENT. The following show will be the state premiere of Frank Wildhorn’s BONNIE & CLYDE.
Each production has received critical acclaim from local reviewers and bloggers. Patrons have given standing ovations and left in tears as they have been moved by the productions. One patron said after CAROUSEL, “I left the theater wanting to be a better person, it made me go home and tell my husband and kids that I love them!” And another patron sent a message after seeing SIDE SHOW that “I have never been moved so much by a production. As someone who has always felt different or didn’t fit in, this show really spoke to me and gave me hope. Thank you for bringing [SIDE SHOW] to Provo.”
Despite its successes, the company has struggled to gain sponsorship and strong attendance.
“It can be discouraging, when you feel that you have put your heart and soul, blood and tears to do everything in your power to make the shows successful, and we don’t receive the full support we need,” said Hebda. “Ticket sales have averaged 25 to 30 percent of the house, which is not covering our operations. I just don’t want our dream to die as we have so much positive momentum. We simply need more patrons and businesses to support our mission.”
Utah Rep has launched an Indiegogo campaign with a goal to raise $10,000. Benefits to contributors include season tickets, flex passes, and tickets to the complete Utah Rep 2014 season. The fundraising event, with all proceeds tax-deductible, can be viewed at http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/utah-rep-s-2014-season-kick-off.
Hebda also announced a resident theater for Utah Rep, in partnership with the Utah Arts Alliance. This non-profit, downtown Salt Lake City arts group has begun to refurbish an adjacent theater known as The Cube specifically for Utah Rep productions.
“Establishing a resident theater location at the Utah Arts Alliance’s The Cube will give Utah Rep an artistic home and increase our visibility as a member of the Utah theater community,” Hebda said.
However, Utah Rep’s quest for funding to remain financially solvent remains.
“If patrons knew some of the obstacles Utah Rep is up against, they would rally to our aid,” said Kymberly Mellen, Utah Rep’s Executive Producer: Artistic Adviser/Casting. “We have been hugely successful in producing shows with increasing production and artistic values.

Mirenesis is the name of our neighbourhood. The buildings are grey. A man is selling simit. There is a party in the park. On a  balcony you can see a green plant growing.








Mirenesis is a contemporary flamenco project by the Turkish dancer Senem Balaban and the Swedish dancer Siri Salminen, taking place in the chaotic and vibrant metropolis of Istanbul. Together with live musicians we are creating a green and grey flamenco performance, asking each other questions, who are you? What is flamenco? Who knows? How can we dance together? In what language should  we speak? What is life, where should you go? What do you do with all the uncertainty?


We have been working with the project since the beginning of 2014, the piece consists of both traditional flamenco and more experimental parts. We started working together with the aim of creating something beyond the stereotypical flamenco cliché, a project expressing our own identities and questions instead of being just another exotistic imitation.





This is a unique collaboration by sincere artists with great integrity. The close collaboration between dancer and musicians is an important part of flamenco, we are therefore happy to work with a highly professional group of people:


Sound artist: Saara Salminen Wallin
Guitar: Doruk Okuyucu
Vocals: Didem Ezgi Kurt & Özgür Çiftçi
Percussion: Mehmed Mert Baycan/Kerem Kırca
Bass guitar: Alper Sonat




Senem Balaban and Siri Salminen are two innovative dance artists, based in Istanbul and Stockholm with many years of flamenco experience both from Turkey, Sweden and Spain.
   What we need
We need your support! We are very inspired and would love to perform our piece. We are currently working very hard, thinking, rehearsing, thinking a bit more, rehearsing again, talking etc. So what we are missing is mostly financial support.
We need your help with the following costs:
Rental of performance venue: 1100 USD
Compensation for musicians and dancers: 3400 USD
Studio rental:   450 USD
Sound system: 900 USD
Think about it, why not support a meeting between Turkey and Sweden and flamenco? All taking place in the metropolis of Istanbul, between Asia and Europe. A unique project!



What you get

To show how grateful we are for your support, we have some gifts for you! 
For example, a thank you video specially made for you, your name mentioned as our sponsor on our DVDs, posters etc, a DVD of our performance sent to you and free tickets to our performance. Take this opportunity to show your support and get something memorable in return.

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>Why is Our 12th Night Different?</b></span></h3>
<div>
<p>Founded in 2010 by Daniel Crane and Erin Sloan, the mission of the Enlightenment Theatre Project
is to “present classical works in a vibrant
and passionate manner, all while living within the truth of the text we perform."" This production of Shakespeare's <b><i>12th Night</i></b>, produced in cooperation with Colonial Williamsburg, promises to deliver on that mission. <b><i>12th Night</i></b> is our first fully-staged production and our third project to date, following successful staged readings of Shakespeare's <b><i>Cymbeline</i></b>, and an original adaptation of <b><i>The Tempest</i></b> by Mr. Crane, presented at Historic Jamestowne.</p>
</div>
<div>So what's different about our production of <b><i>12th Night</i></b>? The Enlightenment Theatre Project will join forces
with Colonial Williamsburg to bring a fully staged version of Shakespeare's <b><i>12th Night</i></b> to
Williamsburg, VA this December. Nine actors, two musicians, and the 18th-century
setting of the Governor’s Palace Ballroom will make this production a must see
event. Directed by Daniel Crane, this production features regional actors from
Washington DC and New York, including alumni from the Academy for Classical
Acting at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC. These actors will
join local talent from the Williamsburg area, including performers from
Colonial Williamsburg, as well as the College of William and Mary. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We also have the cooperation of Colonial Williamsburg's Costume Design Center to provide period costuming. As you can see in the gorgeous painting above by John Heinrich Ramberg from 1789, courtesy of the Yale Center for British Art, we are going for a very luxurious aesthetic. This production is reminiscent of what would have been seen at the British court during the 18th-century, and is a wonderful fit for the atmosphere of the Governor's Palace Ballroom in Colonial Williamsburg.</div>
<div>
<p>With your help, we can create a vibrant theatrical event during the holiday season in Colonial Williamsburg!<br/></p>

</div>
</div><div>
<p><b><i>12th Night</i></b> is a chance for those visiting Williamsburg, VA for the holiday season, as well as those who live locally, to experience a production that would normally be found in Washington DC, New York, or other major cities. This is a ticketed event, with 10 performances between December 17th and December 27th; however, the cost of production cannot be fully offset by ticket sales, and $7,500 is needed to bring the production to fruition.<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p>We are offering special access to the first read-thru and design presentation, as well a chance to share meals with the cast (don't you want to dine with Sir Toby Belch?!) and exclusive access to the final dress rehearsal. </p>
<p>All funds raised will be directly applied to offset the costs of mounting this production. </p>
<h3><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Artistic and Historical Impact</b></h3>
</div><div> <p>This project offers The Enlightenment Theatre Project the opportunity to stage a full work of Shakespeare in a truly unique and historical setting, literally the birthplace of American theatre. This production will give us the opportunity to thoroughly explore this work through the rehearsal process, and share a fully realized production with guests to Colonial Williamsburg during the holiday season.</p>
<p>As we stated earlier, the mission of The Enlightenment Theatre Project is to “present classical works in a vibrant and passionate manner, all while living within the truth of the text we perform."" We can imagine no more truthful setting than where theater in North America began, Williamsburg, VA!

You Can Help! 


12th Night is a chance for those visiting Williamsburg, VA for the holiday season, as well as those who live locally, to experience a production that would normally be found in Washington DC, New York, or other major cities. This is a ticketed event, with 10 performances between December 17th and December 27th; however, the cost of production cannot be fully offset by ticket sales, and $7,500 is needed to bring the production to fruition.
We are offering special access to the first read-thru and design presentation, as well a chance to share meals with the cast (don't you want to dine with Sir Toby Belch?!) and exclusive access to the final dress rehearsal. 
All funds raised will be directly applied to offset the costs of mounting this production. 
Artistic and Historical Impact
 This project offers The Enlightenment Theatre Project the opportunity to stage a full work of Shakespeare in a truly unique and historical setting, literally the birthplace of American theatre. This production will give us the opportunity to thoroughly explore this work through the rehearsal process, and share a fully realized production with guests to Colonial Williamsburg during the holiday season.
As we stated earlier, the mission of The Enlightenment Theatre Project is to “present classical works in a vibrant and passionate manner, all while living within the truth of the text we perform."" We can imagine no more truthful setting than where theater in North America began, Williamsburg, VA!

Aside from our usual production costs, which include rehearsal space, scenery, props, costumes, and marketing, we are now also facing the costs of travel and housing.  We need to transport  3 actors and 6 staff members to Toronto--that costs money!  We also need to throw our cast and crew a bone by providing stipends to help offset the cost of food and local travel.  Unlike when we produce in NYC, our artists will not be able to work other jobs while they are in production. Your gifts will make this possible!  We need to raise $10,000.  Your generous donations will cover these additional costs of travel, food & housing. You will be helping us take ""You Are Perfect"" and White Horse Theater Company to Canadian audiences!The Play:Inspired by the story of Susan Atkins, a real-life member of the Manson family (a quasi-commune led by murder-conspirator Charles Manson in California in the late 1960's), ""You Are Perfect"" uses a unique structure and narrative to enter the world of Manson’s ardent disciple, who was implicated in at least eight coldblooded killings, including the infamous Tate/LaBianca murders.The world premiere of ""You Are Perfect"" was produced by White Horse Theater Company at The Workshop Theater Co., NYC (Feb. 2016) and received both audience and critical praise. The material dealing with the Sharon Tate murders is still fascinating almost half a century later... This is a little gem of a show."" --Mark Savitt, Hi Drama!""After you've seen more Broadway plays than one can count, it's amazing when a production really stands out... Cyndy Marion has redefined the narrative of one of America's saddest moments. She has taken us to a place of understanding by pulling back the veil of a forbidden subject. An event many want to suppress and forget, instead of forgive."" --Scott Cowan, Spotlight About UsNow in our 14th year, White Horse Theater Company is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to producing and developing American plays. We seek to investigate and celebrate American culture by re-examining American classics and nurturing new American voices. White Horse is committed to making high-quality theater and sharing our passion for American plays and playwrights with our fellow artists and audiences.  We are known for producing the work of Sam Shepard including Eyes for Consuela, The Late Henry Moss and True West as well as many of Tennessee Williams' lesser-known works including Clothes for a Summer Hotel, A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot and In The Bar of a Tokyo Hotel.Other Work""Directors who choose the crutch of magical realism when approaching a Sam Shepard play would be better served by recognizing the magic of realism as Cyndy A. Marion has skillfully done in THE LATE HENRY MOSS."" Andrea Stevens, The New York Times""No one does Williams plays like White Horse."" Sherri Rase, QONSTAGE.COM on Suddenly Last SummerThe TeamThis production includes many our trusted artistic collaborators and a number of new ones!

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We, ODE. Movements, are committed to ground-breaking, transformative story-telling within which the Artist is challenged to re-envision the archetypal portrayals of violence, intimidation and fear; to awaken in our colleagues a desire to address the subject matter from a fresh perspective. We wish to provide a platform for the artists to have their work showcased and shared while strengthening an Arts Community culture where the work we create stimulates artists and audiences alike to expand the imagination. We wish to inspire humankind to have a desire to extend its vision and seek the opportunity to exchange ideas and inspire moments of optimism. Together, we hope to form an international family of members to bring inspiration and innovation to every project and promote respect for diversity in an age of global community.</p>

<p>This year, we have the honor to present in association with Up In the Air Theatre, 'NeOn' written by Mayumi Yoshida and directed by Laura McLean, as part of the rEvolver festival 2017 (<a href=""https://www.upintheairtheatre.com/neon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.upintheairtheatre.com/neon</a>).</p>
<p>We need your help to bring this beautiful story to life and to help support the amazingly talented people working with us on this production. We believe passion drives all art but artists need not always be 'starving artists'.</p>
<p><strong>NeOn-</strong><strong>ね音</strong><strong>-</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">Framed around the revelation of a deep secret within Mayumi Yoshida’s beloved late grandmother’s arranged marriage, NeOn is a look at Love. True Love: does it exist? Has anyone ever got it right? Are there different forms of True Love? Why have we all been, all over the world, conditioned to yearn for it? Told through multiple intertwining stories, NeOn transcends generations, continents and language. An « international citizen’s » charming look at what it means to negotiate love on either part of the world.</p>
<p>The SHOULDs, WOULDs and COULDs about choice…and the grace of accepting when there isn’t one.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The target of $1500 is primarily to help us remunerate our cast and crew as they deserve. Creating art is incredible but funding it in a way that also includes paying everyone on board what they deserve is often difficult. We have a cast of 6 and crew of 8. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We feel that the story of 'NeOn' is so important and relevant today. It is a multi-cultural, multi-generational story that takes a look at how we relate to others in our lives and to ourselves. We feel that in this day and age, when we are all more connected than ever, we actually are getting more disconnected from each other and have a more difficult time relating to the people around us. Everyone can connect with a part of that story and we think it needs to be told. </p>
<p>In addition, as a society that is deeply rooted in the community, your support means more than we can tell. We want to ensure that the arts community in this city is here to support each other. We want to be able to remunerate the dedicated artists working hard to bring this story to life. We want to support a still growing local theater community, and you are a part of that! </p>
<p>We would love your help to strengthen a global community where love and support is at the forefront; art helps us all create the world, let's make it a kind one.</p>

<h3><u>""Whited Sepulcher"" on Competition Final</u></h3>
<p>After many years dancing and learning from amazing choreographers from all over the world, I’ve developed interest in the actual creation of dance and started to pursue my own choreographic work.  My recent work, Whited Sepulcher has been selected to go to the final at the International Choreographic Competition, held in Yokohama, Japan.  I need financial support to be able to cover airfare for me and my four dancers to be able to perform and participate in this Incredible event.</p>

<p>A an independent emerging female artist, with no company structure or grants facilitating my projects yet, being selected as a finalist (10 choreographers out of 138 choreographers from all around the world) is truly a milestone for me.  I want to honor this exciting opportunity not only to present my work there, but to also broaden my audience, and have the chance to exchange knowledge, artistry and the creativities in the art of dance with the other choreographers and judges from all over the world.</p>
<p>I am asking for your support for my first participation to the International Choreographic Competition.  Your generosity will be what makes this possible.  THANK YOU!<br/> </p>

<h3><u>What I Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p>I need to be able to cover airfare,  (5 round trip tickets Sapporo/Tokyo) and 4 nights of hotel accommodations (3 rehearsal days and 2 performance days).</p>
<p>It is important and useful for artists in this era to showcase our work, experience and creation with the social media platforms.  I will be creating a blog about the competition final and rehearsals up the performance.  The blog will be shared online for backers to see all the creative and artistic exchange happening within the events with other finalists from different countries.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Kidz Theater needs your help to produce our 2018 season!  We are currently dealing with the skyrocketing costs of production in New York City--while we are looking to raise $10,000, which isn't even a quarter of production cost for a single show.  Kidz Theater has become a home for its staff and returning company members and we are determined to keep it GOING! That's where you come in!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is $10,000 for this season.  It costs well over $25,000 to produce each show, so this money would be instrumental in providing rehearsal space, renting the theater, props, costumes, set, as well as making sure we can keep mainstage participation for our mentor performers COMPLETELY FREE!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our program primarily serves as a training ground for children and teenagers pursuing careers in musical theater and technical theater.  This season, our productions were performed and operated by a VERY talented group of teenagers working both on and off stage.  Our performers have gone off to alma maters such as Boston Conservatory, University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music (CCM), Carnegie Mellon, Pace University, New York University,  Elon University, Point Park University, Shenandoah University, among others; and have appeared on Broadway in <i>Aladdin, Les Miserables, Dear Evan Hansen, The Book of Mormon, Evita,</i> and <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>; on the West End in Dreamgirls and in National Tours in <i>Newsies, Les Miserables,</i> among others.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The disappearance of Kidz Theater would mean the disappearance of one of the strongest performing arts educational platforms in the tri-state area.  </p>
<p>Children and teenagers who want to pursue careers as performers look at us as a way to de-mystify the process; we recognize their love for performing and we turn it into amazing productions and give them roles that equally challenge them and allow them to have fun.  Without your help, we could be at risk of closing our doors forever.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Spread the word!  Tell your friends! Tell your friends' friends! Text them, call them, email them. We need word of mouth to get out about Kidz Theater so that people know who we are and what we do.  We rely on you all to keep our home growing and changing, and we TRULY thank you for all that you have done and continue to do.</p>

With my company Making Strange, I've produced and performed in award-winning, world-touring shows including the Irish premieres of <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch </i>and <i>The Last Days of Judas Iscariot<i>, </i></i>and the original creations <i>Luck</i> and <i>You Remember the Stories You Wish Were True</i>. As a performer, I've appeared as Girl in <i>Once: The Musical</i>, originated the role of Liza Field in Frank McGuinness's musical <i>Donegal </i>at the Abbey, and toured Australia, New York, and Toronto (amidst multiple Dublin runs too) with THISISPOPBABY in <i>RIOT</i>. After a hiatus from making work, I'm finally returning with this project I've had in mind for years, in a festival in Dublin very close to my heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Show</h3>
<p>The show, <i>It's Not About Love</i>, asks these questions and more: what does it mean that the Romeo and Juliet story is one of the first love stories of which we become aware at a young age, and it's about teenagers who wreak havoc and die? What is the effect of this being the first Shakespeare play that people usually see or read? And what place does this story have in the world as it is today? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>It's Not About Love </i>is directed by Aoife Spillane-Hinks and performed with some of Dublin's most exciting and prolific musicians, including Ruth McGill of The Evertides. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're crowdfunding at least €2000 to get the show ready for the festival. Our perks include special limited-edition badges, tickets to opening night, and most excitingly, behind-the-scenes videos, including bespoke sonnet recitations according to your whim or specially recorded performances of songs considered for the show but didn't quite make it. You could even get a personal Shakespeare workshop for you and friends!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your pledge goes to all those wonderful up-front requirements, including buying set, costume, and lighting; booking rehearsal space; paying the musicians, director, and designers for their valuable time; and documenting performances to help the show's future life and the opportunity to revive the show and tour! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will ease the challenges of birthing a new show into the world by reassuring us that our vision will come to be, and therefore allowing us to focus on creating rather than admin. I've run successful crowdfunding campaigns in the past, most specifically for my show <i>You Remember the Stories You Wish Were True, </i>and the difference it makes to the creative process knowing that cash flow is taken care of is immeasurable. <i>It's Not About Love</i> is a true labour of, well, love, and--without spoiling too much about the show--we believe the journey we'll give the audience and what they'll leave feeling is joyous, life-affirming, and necessary. All funds raised at this point give us more access to creating that experience for you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word amongst your networks if you think this would be of interest to your friends, even if they're not in Dublin or Ireland--with enough momentum and documentation, we'll be able to take this show anywhere. Indiegogo has handy share tools for social media and we'd love for you to use them.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Angry Young Men ltd is a puppet creation and performance company that was founded in 2007.  The team was gathered together to create Night Of The Living Dead - The Puppet Show!  We've been performing that show every Halloween ever since and we've also performed NOTLD-TPS at colleges and multiple horror conventions around the country.  We've been performing NOTLD-TPS at the Oriental Theater for 6 years now.  The Oriental Theater has been great to us but there are limitations to performing in that space due to the nature of it being a Movie Theater: we couldn't rent the space on the weekend and there are light and sound issues that made it hard for our audiences to see/hear us.  Since this is our 10th Anniversary of NOTLD-TPS we wanted to nip those issues in the bud and do everything PERFECT this year.  This has led us to securing the Next Act Theater Performance Space as our show location for the 10th Anniversary Show.  An ACTUAL theatre space with actual theatre lights and seating close enough to see and hear everything we do!</p>
<p>That leads us to the reason behind this campaign.  We don't like asking for a hand out so we're treating this campaign as an Investment Opportunity.  Our contributors can secure a VIP seat in a reserved section and also get swag and a chance to be a part of the show!  Using the campaign as an Advance Ticket Sales Machine will allow us to pay our rental fee up front so we can stop worrying about money and kick zombie butt doing the show!</p>
<p>Renting the Next Act Theater performance space is a bit more costly than the Oriental, but having access to the space all week and getting to do 3 performances are all major improvements to the show!  It will look better than it ever has and we will be more prepared than ever before!  Our fans are why we keep doing this show year after year.  Having the fans help the show BEFORE it begins will bind them even closer to our hearts and the undying legacy that is Night Of The Living Dead - The Puppet Show!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have already paid the deposit to secure the Next Act Performance Space.  Here is the rest of what we need to make this show shine!</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,900 - The remainder of our rental cost</li>
<li>$250 - Insurance Certificate needed to perform in the space</li>
<li>$200 - Marketing materials: posters/postcards, etc.</li>
<li>$650 - SWAG: new T-shirts, new buttons, new stuff with our logo on it so you can take it home!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>a $10 donation gets you a unique NOTLD-TPS related button!</li>
<li>a $20 donation gets you a VIP Ticket to one of the performances AND a button!</li>
<li>a $30 donation gets you a NOTLD-TPS T-shirt AND a button!</li>

<li>a $100 donation gets you the VIP ticket, the T-Shirt, the Button and YOU get to be one of our Gore Technicians during the show!  That means you get a great seat AND you get to throw blood and zombie brains!  There are only 4 of these perks available per show.</li>

</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TO CLAIM A PERK YOU HAVE TO DONATE BY CLICKING ON THE PERK ITSELF</strong></p>
<p>If we don't reach our main goal then any of the money we raised will go directly to the Next Act rental and we'll combine our penny jars to make the rest happen.</p>
<p>If we make more than our goal we will be able to turn our tech volunteers into paid staff!  We'll invest in more swag!  We may even put down a deposit at Next Act for next year's show!</p>
<p>This show means the world to us and we love the people who come back to see it year after year.  We've met a good number of the original cast of the original Night Of The Living Dead (as well as the Dawn and Day movies) and they've seen our show and treated us like we're doing the Lord's Work.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute to this campaign you can always just buy a regular ticket to see the show.  Tickets go on sale October 1st at nextact.org.  And if you can't share your funds then please share the good word of our Zombie Puppet Mayhem.  We just won't stay dead.</p>

<p>Our goal is to mount great shows.</p>
<p>Greenbelt Arts Center's performance space is used for resident and guest company productions, a summer youth theatre camp, and community events such as the Utopia Film Festival.  Greenbelt residents of all ages are involved in the production of these events and enable our audiences (many of whom are also Greenbelt residents) to experience live theater, music and dance in an intimate space. </p>
<p>Turning a bowling alley / archery range into a sophisticated theatre space is no easy task.

<p>Because our performance space has two configurations (with seating on three sides of the stage and with all seating facing the entrance), creating effective lighting can involve relocation and re-cabling of most of the lighting instruments.  This complex and even daunting process makes individual lighting for a show extremely time-consuming, requiring frequent trips up and down ladders and making reconfiguration more work and less safe.</p>

<li style=""margin-left:18pt;""> Connection of the outlets (and lighting instruments plugged into them} to the power packs will be made by a patch panel, allowing needed flexibility in the use of the outlets.</li>

<p>Cloud of Fools Theater Company, based in New York City, is a company of alumni from Columbia University’s Graduate Acting Program. We have been training, teaching workshops, participating in symposia, and performing here in New York and in international festivals (in Germany, Italy, and Puerto Rico) since 2003. </p>
<p>The root of our theater as a “Cloud of Fools” is our ongoing, rigorous practical explorations – our training – which is part of a lineage leading back from this moment through many generations. Simply put, we find our way forward by listening to (and conversing with) the masters of the past. Master playwrights, yes, but more concretely, master teachers and actors who remain with us through the living re-engagement of their bodies of physical knowledge, passed down from maestro to apprentice across time and culture. For example, we are trained by maestro Niky Wolcz, who was in turn trained by his mentors; traditions have been passed down to us from all over Europe, Russia, India, and Asia. From these deep wells of human story and theatrical experience, we unfold a theater at once timeless, and ceaselessly new.</p>
<p>So, in our process we ask: “As bodies in space that are vibrant with this living knowledge, how much can we conjure into the theater – and therefore into the imagination which we will ultimately share with our audience”? (That is, with <strong>you!</strong>)  And, trusting in the depth of such imaginative resources, we ask, “How much can we create – from how little?”</p>
<p><strong>Cloud of Fools Theater Company is Jon Froehlich, Susan Hyon, Laura Butler Rivera, and Casey Robinson</strong></p>
<h2><strong><br/></strong></h2>
<h2>
<strong>Stepping into the Fray: About <em>The Whistling Mortician</em></strong> </h2>
<p>“When the powers of death crop up at every turn, what else can one do...but whistle?”  Like the holy fools before him and the characters of Chaplin and Keaton a couple generations later,<em> The Whistling Mortician</em> postulates the life of a puckish Prussian laborer living in the hotbed of 1870’s Alsace-Lorraine. One fateful day following the Franco-Prussian war, he whistles the wrong national anthem up and down the streets of town – and directly into trouble. Fleeing to far-off countries and meeting colorful characters all the way, he finds himself drawn towards the work that will define his life.”</p>
<p>Using some sticks, a bit of foam board, and our selves, the world of <em>The Whistling Mortician</em> will traverse whole continents and oceans as it unfurls the whimsical journey of our hero. Music, death, war, and waltzing: we’re curious to see just how significantly a simple tune can change a life.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be featured at the PAM 2012 Festival presented by IATI Theater <a href=""http://www.teatroiati.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.teatroiati.org</a></p>

<p>Our expenses total $6,900. This includes costs for marketing, production material, the production staff, and the creative team. </p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $4,000. This amount will enable us to pay the ensemble (8 performers) a stipend of $500 for their work and commitment, which began on April 29 and extends through August 9. The pay is a gesture of our gratitude for everyone’s time and commitment. It is in no way a living wage, but it is something. We need your help to extend this token of appreciation to our talented team of artists.</p>
<p>Four of the actors are recent MFA Acting graduates. This project allows them to continue their work and training as they transition into the business. It’s an exciting and daunting time to launch into the real world as an actor, after three years of intensive training, where the focus is solely on the art. We believe this opportunity assuages some of the difficulties of this launch period for our young artists, by providing a family of mature theater artists to grow with and extend into.</p>

<p>We bring a level of craft and precision, imagination and rigor, all of which for us ultimately points not to itself, but perhaps to a taste of things that cannot be defined, explained, or perceived in the terms common to our everyday lives. Far from simply esoteric, we embody the words of one of the “grandfathers” of our lineage: “That which is imperceptible demands precision.” We are hard at work, building a rich world that both entertains, and deeply nourishes.</p>
<p>Believe us, you’ll get your money’s worth – perhaps with low production overhead, but with artistic nourishment beyond measure. This is what we strive to share with the world.</p>

Cloud of Fools Theater Company, based in New York City, is a company of alumni from Columbia University’s Graduate Acting Program. We have been training, teaching workshops, participating in symposia, and performing here in New York and in international festivals (in Germany, Italy, and Puerto Rico) since 2003. 
The root of our theater as a “Cloud of Fools” is our ongoing, rigorous practical explorations – our training – which is part of a lineage leading back from this moment through many generations. Simply put, we find our way forward by listening to (and conversing with) the masters of the past. Master playwrights, yes, but more concretely, master teachers and actors who remain with us through the living re-engagement of their bodies of physical knowledge, passed down from maestro to apprentice across time and culture. For example, we are trained by maestro Niky Wolcz, who was in turn trained by his mentors; traditions have been passed down to us from all over Europe, Russia, India, and Asia. From these deep wells of human story and theatrical experience, we unfold a theater at once timeless, and ceaselessly new.
So, in our process we ask: “As bodies in space that are vibrant with this living knowledge, how much can we conjure into the theater – and therefore into the imagination which we will ultimately share with our audience”? (That is, with you!)  And, trusting in the depth of such imaginative resources, we ask, “How much can we create – from how little?”
Cloud of Fools Theater Company is Jon Froehlich, Susan Hyon, Laura Butler Rivera, and Casey Robinson


Stepping into the Fray: About The Whistling Mortician 
“When the powers of death crop up at every turn, what else can one do...but whistle?”  Like the holy fools before him and the characters of Chaplin and Keaton a couple generations later, The Whistling Mortician postulates the life of a puckish Prussian laborer living in the hotbed of 1870’s Alsace-Lorraine. One fateful day following the Franco-Prussian war, he whistles the wrong national anthem up and down the streets of town – and directly into trouble. Fleeing to far-off countries and meeting colorful characters all the way, he finds himself drawn towards the work that will define his life.”
Using some sticks, a bit of foam board, and our selves, the world of The Whistling Mortician will traverse whole continents and oceans as it unfurls the whimsical journey of our hero. Music, death, war, and waltzing: we’re curious to see just how significantly a simple tune can change a life.
We are thrilled to be featured at the PAM 2012 Festival presented by IATI Theater http://www.teatroiati.org

<em>The Decay of Cities</em> is an experiment by the members of Enthuse Theater into the how, where &amp; why of theater-making.  </h3>
<p>We begin with a company of performers, designers, dramaturgs, theater-artists.</p>
<p>We pose an interrogation: What is it to exist in decay?</p>
<p>We are in the midst of building a triptych: creating three devised, site-specific, interactive theatrical events while occupying three different American locations.</p>
<p>The first, <a href=""http://www.enthusetheater.org/Enthuse_Theater/An_Orchard_of_Cherries.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""An Orchard of Cherries""><em>An Orchard of Cherries</em></a>, was created by 10 members of the company occupying an abandoned family farm in Maine for 10 days.  The second, <em>Orchard-Less</em>, will be created this November in an abandoned sheet metal shop in New Orleans, Louisianna.  The third will be created in an as-yet-determined site in Detroit.</p>
<p>We are documenting the creation of these pieces, evolving the method we use to make them and accumulating the material we build them on.  </p>
<p>They all are grounded in the bodies of the creators and the locations of their creation.  <em>An Orchard of Cherries</em> used, as source-material, Anton Chekhov's <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>.  The piece spoke directly to our generation of Americans, the first who will not ""do better"" than the ones before them.</p>
<p><em>Orchard-Less</em> will incorporate the late writings of Tennesse Williams and examine the American archetypes who silently rage within societies' structures.  We will also be looking to work with local actors, musicians, dancers and artists, adding them to our companies' ranks while there.</p>
<p>Once these three pieces have been created, the data and material collected, we will develop the final piece of theater: The Decay of Cities.  We will bring this completely original performance back home to New York.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Right now we are in desperate need of funding to get us to New Orleans to develop the second part of this work.  Venue security and other logisitcal issues have been slow to solidify, hence the late call for donations.  But we now have a confirmed venue and confirmed performance dates and times.  We even have housing sorted.  We just need to get there.  </p>
<p>We also are taking this opportunity to begin building a community of folk interested in the project as it develops.  Know that while you're donating to us so we can put on a show in New Orleans, it's all working towards bringing a show to you some time next year.  With a donation you will become a part of the community with insite into how the piece is developed, where it goes from here and when it will be coming to a theater near you.</p>
<p>Over the years Enthuse Theater has continued to create <span>enthusiastically create performances of scale and magnitude that diligently sound for evasive truths, starkly illuminate contradictions, loosen the fetters on the imagination and push the boundaries of the where, why, how and what of theater.</span>  This is, by far, our most ambitious project yet.  And the most necessary one.  Those who were audience members at the farm in Maine can attest to the incredible uniqueness of the experience.  The further development of this piece and of the way we are making work together is crucial now more than at any other point in our company's history.  We're working on bringing you an experience unlike any you've had before.   </p>

<p>Inspired by the ancient tale of Cain and Abel, “The Little Soldiers” by acclaimed company Theatre Re combines spellbinding physical theatre and a sonic landscape created by live musical narrative to portray a timeless rivalry.</p>

<p align=""center""><em>Half-Pint Theatre was founded in the summer of 2011 by four so-called ”half-pints” with big dreams, and an even bigger desire to be a part of Toronto’s theatrical scene. </em></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center""><em>Half-Pint was created with the intention to produce those shows that one dreams of working on but are rarely given the chance. Our vision is to collaborate and explore these works with other artists who share this passion and enthusiasm, so that audiences are given a show that has been cared for, nurtured, and brought to life with the vibrant energy of those who are compelled and inspired to tell the story.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>In addition to our productions, we hope to set the groundwork for a supportive artistic community. Through play-readings, events and workshops we aim to provide artists with the opportunity to ask questions, get advice, connect, and most importantly play.</em></p>
<p><em>Half-Pint’s inaugural production of “tick, tick…BOOM!” was a limited run presented at Buddies In Bad Times Theatre in February 2012 to wonderful audience response and acclaim. </em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>This just in!</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>""tick, tick...BOOM!"" has been nominated for 9 BROADWAY WORLD TORONTO AWARDS including: Best Production of a Musical, Best Direction of a Musical: Alanna Stone, Best Actor in a Lead Role: Jeremy LaPalme, Best Actress in a Lead Role: Esther Vallins, Best Actor in a Featured role: Jon Chou, and Best Independent Theatre Production!</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“A NIGHT OF SHANLEY”</span></em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em>Our sophomore show “A Night of Shanley” is a double bill featuring John Patrick Shanley’s classic one-act plays “Welcome to the Moon” and “Women of Manhattan”. Joined by some of our favourite Shanley monologues, this evening is a tribute to the works of one of the most celebrated playwrights of the last 50 years.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>“What I admire most are that his plays are beautifully well made, economical, sharp and coherent. I like the toughness of his writing a lot. He's not a misanthrope, but he's in pursuit of why people behave as badly as they do along with having a great compassion for them. That's an unusual and interesting combination.''</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>~ Tony Kushner, Playwright (Angels in America)</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What we need and What you get</span></em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em>Between royalty rights, the rent for our venue, production costs, advertising, and payment for our cast and crew our budget for this show is $6,500. Our goal is to raise $5000. You may ask why our goal is so high?</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>The artistic team of Half-Pint is already planning our third show (most likely going up this summer). Our hope is to make enough money from this campaign to cover the majority of our current expenses, that way we can use the money from our ticket sales towards our next show. We want to create an established company and eventually have full seasons. Your contribution will not only help “A Night of Shanley” but will also help our future productions to come.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>To reward your generosity in supporting this project we’ve thought long and hard about some amazing perks. You will of course get a very enthusiastic thank you on all of our social media, and depending on your contribution can get VIP tickets to the show, a personalized singing telegram (done live if you live in the GTA, and by video if you do not – good for playing jokes, happy birthdays, and seasons’ greetings), a care package from the “Women of Manhattan”, a date with the cast, and even your own private concert featuring the ladies of Half-Pint and our talented friends.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>This is a “flexible” campaign meaning that if we do not reach our goal we will still receive the money you have donated and that it will go towards this production. We might just have to sell our organs to pay for the rest – don’t worry, nothing vital…hopefully.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE IMPACT</span></em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em>Theatre in Toronto is changing. If a theatre like the Princess of Wales can get torn down for condos, how are we supposed to continue to be one of the top theatrical cities in the world? It will come down to the next generation of artistic entrepreneurs to keep this city at the top of its game. Companies like Half-Pint need your donations in these first few years so that we can grow to become the next Factory Theatre or Acting Up Stage. By supporting us you are supporting a team that cares for the future of our theatres and wants to propel Toronto into the next stage of this theatrical evolution.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>We are setting the groundwork so that Half-Pint Theatre can be around for a long time. Your generous donations will go one or more of these very important places:</em></p>

Small… but mighty.
Half-Pint Theatre was founded in the summer of 2011 by four so-called ”half-pints” with big dreams, and an even bigger desire to be a part of Toronto’s theatrical scene. 
 
Half-Pint was created with the intention to produce those shows that one dreams of working on but are rarely given the chance. Our vision is to collaborate and explore these works with other artists who share this passion and enthusiasm, so that audiences are given a show that has been cared for, nurtured, and brought to life with the vibrant energy of those who are compelled and inspired to tell the story.
In addition to our productions, we hope to set the groundwork for a supportive artistic community. Through play-readings, events and workshops we aim to provide artists with the opportunity to ask questions, get advice, connect, and most importantly play.
Half-Pint’s inaugural production of “tick, tick…BOOM!” was a limited run presented at Buddies In Bad Times Theatre in February 2012 to wonderful audience response and acclaim. 
This just in!
""tick, tick...BOOM!"" has been nominated for 9 BROADWAY WORLD TORONTO AWARDS including: Best Production of a Musical, Best Direction of a Musical: Alanna Stone, Best Actor in a Lead Role: Jeremy LaPalme, Best Actress in a Lead Role: Esther Vallins, Best Actor in a Featured role: Jon Chou, and Best Independent Theatre Production!
 
 
“A NIGHT OF SHANLEY”
Our sophomore show “A Night of Shanley” is a double bill featuring John Patrick Shanley’s classic one-act plays “Welcome to the Moon” and “Women of Manhattan”. Joined by some of our favourite Shanley monologues, this evening is a tribute to the works of one of the most celebrated playwrights of the last 50 years.
 
“What I admire most are that his plays are beautifully well made, economical, sharp and coherent. I like the toughness of his writing a lot. He's not a misanthrope, but he's in pursuit of why people behave as badly as they do along with having a great compassion for them. That's an unusual and interesting combination.''
~ Tony Kushner, Playwright (Angels in America)
 
 
What we need and What you get
Between royalty rights, the rent for our venue, production costs, advertising, and payment for our cast and crew our budget for this show is $6,500. Our goal is to raise $5000. You may ask why our goal is so high?
The artistic team of Half-Pint is already planning our third show (most likely going up this summer). Our hope is to make enough money from this campaign to cover the majority of our current expenses, that way we can use the money from our ticket sales towards our next show. We want to create an established company and eventually have full seasons. Your contribution will not only help “A Night of Shanley” but will also help our future productions to come.
 
To reward your generosity in supporting this project we’ve thought long and hard about some amazing perks. You will of course get a very enthusiastic thank you on all of our social media, and depending on your contribution can get VIP tickets to the show, a personalized singing telegram (done live if you live in the GTA, and by video if you do not – good for playing jokes, happy birthdays, and seasons’ greetings), a care package from the “Women of Manhattan”, a date with the cast, and even your own private concert featuring the ladies of Half-Pint and our talented friends.
 
This is a “flexible” campaign meaning that if we do not reach our goal we will still receive the money you have donated and that it will go towards this production. We might just have to sell our organs to pay for the rest – don’t worry, nothing vital…hopefully.
 
THE IMPACT
Theatre in Toronto is changing. If a theatre like the Princess of Wales can get torn down for condos, how are we supposed to continue to be one of the top theatrical cities in the world? It will come down to the next generation of artistic entrepreneurs to keep this city at the top of its game. Companies like Half-Pint need your donations in these first few years so that we can grow to become the next Factory Theatre or Acting Up Stage. By supporting us you are supporting a team that cares for the future of our theatres and wants to propel Toronto into the next stage of this theatrical evolution.
We are setting the groundwork so that Half-Pint Theatre can be around for a long time. Your generous donations will go one or more of these very important places:
1) Production costs
2) The licensing rights for the plays and our venue.
 A two-week run is obviously more expensive then a one-week run, but what we learned from our last production (which had 4 performances) was that it didn’t allow the public many chances to come out and see what we had been working on for months. If they weren’t free that weekend, then they weren’t able to see it. This longer run grants our audience flexibility and gives them more opportunities to come out and see the show.  
3) Payment for the cast and artistic team. 
We may only be in our second year of operation but it has been a priority from day one for us to pay the people who work diligently to make this show great. 
 
If I CAN’T DONATE CAN I STILL HELP?
Absolutely!! If you are financially troubled and are unable to donate your money here are some other ways you can still help:

You can donate costumes, props or sets 
Volunteer your time 
SPREAD THE WORD 
You can still help us reach our goal without having to spend a penny. Tell your friends and family, email your peeps, like our facebook page, and please share this campaign through your social media (facebook, twitter, etc.)

<h2>Potentially Sketchy </h2>
<p>Potentially Sketchy is a diverse group of theatre-trained actors and comedians who want to showcase the value of prioritizing a variety of voices when producing comedy; when everyone is heard, no topic is left unassailed, and the results are devastatingly funny.</p>
<p>We are currently working furiously to prepare for our first show in October of 2018, and we are asking for your help to give us the extra push we need to get this project to its final stages.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>We are currently raising $1000. These funds are for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renting theatre spaces</li>
<li>Building props</li>
<li>Making costumes</li>
<li>Covering some small marketing costs</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In return for supporting us, you get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>$5 donation -  1 shoutout on social media</p></li>
<li><p>$10 donation - 1 ticket + shoutout</p></li>

<h3>What your donation means</h3>
<p>Your donation means more people get to see diversity on a comedic stage - they get to see themselves represented, and that's important. In turn, as we grow, more spaces and opportunities will be created for comedians who are people of colour, women, and/or queer. We don’t pay lip-service to diversity, we actively cultivate it.</p>

Your support will go directly toward supporting the production team who is working hard to bring together an immersive performance experience!Your Contributions Will Go Toward
Paying the artists for their time in rehearsals

<p><strong>What is Vertigo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vertigo gives undergraduate playwrights the opportunity to have their original scripts realized into full-fledged productions.</strong> By producing student-written theatre, Vertigo hopes to be a creative and dynamic presence on campus, encouraging students to take artistic risk. Vertigo is the only student theatre organization on campus that produces entirely student-written work.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about This Is Not A True Story!</strong></p>
<p>This Is Not a True Story takes the heroines from “Madame Butterfly”, “Miss Saigon”, and the Case of Takako Konishi out of their Orientalist, romanticized origins, and gives them their own lives and, for some, their own last names. We follow the lives of these three young Asian women as they contend with the white men so keen on wooing them: a geisha in late 1800s Japan, a bar girl in mid 1970s Vietnam, and a treasure hunter in 21st century Japan. As times collide, fates change and tragic fiction is re-written. For some, though, the hard facts of their realities remain.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I support This Is Not A True Story?</strong></p>
<p>This Is Not A True Story is about the myths and unvarnished realities in the lives of East Asian women. A cast entirely made up of Asian-American women pursues love, friendship, family, career goals and their own places in the world at a breakneck pace. Shows that talk so honestly about fetishization, anti-Asian racism, sexual assault, motherhood and agency are rare in the theatre world. Preston’s script dares to be honest and clear. We couldn’t be more excited to premier his newest play!</p>
<p><strong>Where does the money go?</strong></p>
<p>All donations go to major design elements that, put together, will bring the world of the show to life. Each piece of the puzzle is absolutely vital in making the show what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Set and Space:</strong> We’re creating two worlds: the stereotypical “Orient” of shows like <i>Madame Butterfly</i>and <i>Miss Saigon, </i>and the unfamiliar, lonely United States. The space becomes a tea garden, a geisha’s home, a war-torn Vietnam, Fargo, ND, and the space for awkward, meaningful phone calls. We’ll be creating a space that invites the audience into these fictional and true worlds and makes them uncomfortable at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Lights:</strong> In each act, we’re using light to create mood – it’s just as responsible for bringing the space to life as the set. With a largely white-based set, lights will really set the tone.</p>
<p><strong>Sound:</strong> With so many settings and so many in-person and face-to-face interactions, our sound team is critical, creating impactful, bold moments.</p>
<p><strong>Props:</strong> We couldn’t show a character’s discovery of <i>War and Peace, </i>predicting new love on flower petals, or an apartment marked by depression without our amazing props team.</p>
<p><strong>Costumes:</strong> In order to recreate styles from late 19<sup>th</sup>-century Japan, 1970s Vietnam and early 2000s Japan, our costume designer is buying, renting and creating pieces. Our actresses double roles, and realistic, detailed costumes help distinguish new worlds and eras from each other.</p>
<p><strong>Hair and Makeup:</strong> From geishas and bar girls to office ladies and worried mothers, our hair and makeup team will help display and break down stereotypes of East Asian women.</p>

<h4>Information about the artists...</h4>
<h4>Sally and Tuva's collaboration started unknowingly on a commuting train in 2004,  as they both attended the Swedish Ballet School in Malmö, only to reconvene ten years later after numerous of skype conversations. Sally is based in Lund, Sweden and Tuva is based in New York and Sweden. Sitting on each side of the Atlantic ocean, this project commenced with a simple discussion about performance anxiety, which spiraled into topics such as capitalism, success, end-gaining, patriarchy, presence, authenticity, reality, intimacy, sex, violence and much more. In February 2015 they had their first full-time Artist-In-Residence for 5 weeks at Theater aan the Rijn, Generale Oost, in the Netherlands. There they made the first iteration of this piece, which premiered at Teater aan de Rijn, Arnhem (NE) and it is still emerging. Sally and Tuva's major questions today are: What is authenticity and is it possible not to perform in life, art and work? How can we use performance as activism? What is it to practice feminism and co-existence today in life, in collaborations and on stage?</h4>

</div></h4>
<p>Total sum: $2500</p> <h4>Impact</h4>
<p>The sexual abuse and intimate partner violence rate in US is incredibly high and in the rest of the world it is not better.  In Sweden girls are burnt out from high performance in school before they have even finished high school. People are taught today to value individual performance more than collective actions and community. It is a fact that advertising is successful because it feeds on giving women (and men) low-self esteem. The way women of all ethnicities are portrayed in advertising and music videos specifically affects women of all backgrounds; when the body is compared to an object everyday it leads to lack of empathy for the body and person and it contributes to violation of the body. We are fed from a young age with the information that a woman is lacking something (negative space) and that the man has something (positive space). When we did a survey with our friends as research, asking about their relationship to their vagina, four out of five women responded that they had experienced sexual abuse and therefore had a complex relationship with their pelvis and vagina. </p>
<p>These are just a few of the facts that encourages us to do this project and that we want to change by spreading this show to a wider audience.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Risks &amp; Challenges</h4>
<p>We didn't have much time, but it was enough to pull this show together once again. Sally bought a flight ticket with money that she realistically didn't have, arrived to New York on March 19th, rehearsed the show and then had to go back to Sweden two weeks later to work. It is a wonderful, vulnerable, giving and playful experience to rehearse this show. Our major challenges are the practical aspects that a high budget theater usually can take care of, but that we also have to focus on at this stage of our career. A major obstacle is also the distance between us and that it is so expensive to travel between New York and Europe. The largest obstacle is the stress that can occur if we will anticipate to go minus and the consequences that will lead to. One consequence is that it could be very hard to continue with this project. A challenge is to get all the practical aspects, such as marketing, grants writing, videography, set design  together for each time we are invited to perform the piece. However, with your potential support, our hard work, tight schedule, will-power and enthusiasm, we will make it happen.</p>

That Disgusting Thing Called Intimacy is an evening length multidisciplinary performance dealing with power-structures, desire and intimacy. 

That Disgusting Thing Called Intimacy is a choreography of desire and rejection, expectations and failures. An evening-length performance questioning the constitution of gender, power structures, sexuality and success embedded within popular culture, arts and politics. A space where you are allowed to see and be seen.
Through humor, provocation, improvisation, choreography and spoken word, our duet strives to break down expectations on gender and performance steered by neo-liberal capitalist structures. We put ourselves through task-based improvisation and choreography in extreme physical states, performing and decomposing the identity of a woman and femininity. By pushing boundaries and creating an anti-spectacle we allow what is underneath the performance to unfold itself and blur the line between fiction and reality. That Disgusting Thing Called Intimacy complicates and redefines the expectations on women as well as the performer and power-structures within the institutionalized space of the theater.
 
 “ … Their work uniquely addresses the complex issue of feminism and the role of women in contemporary society.

It was developed with support by Generale Oost Production House (NE) and Jersey City Theater Center (NJ).

Information about the artists...
Sally and Tuva's collaboration started unknowingly on a commuting train in 2004,  as they both attended the Swedish Ballet School in Malmö, only to reconvene ten years later after numerous of skype conversations. Sally is based in Lund, Sweden and Tuva is based in New York and Sweden. Sitting on each side of the Atlantic ocean, this project commenced with a simple discussion about performance anxiety, which spiraled into topics such as capitalism, success, end-gaining, patriarchy, presence, authenticity, reality, intimacy, sex, violence and much more. In February 2015 they had their first full-time Artist-In-Residence for 5 weeks at Theater aan the Rijn, Generale Oost, in the Netherlands. There they made the first iteration of this piece, which premiered at Teater aan de Rijn, Arnhem (NE) and it is still emerging. Sally and Tuva's major questions today are: What is authenticity and is it possible not to perform in life, art and work? How can we use performance as activism? What is it to practice feminism and co-existence today in life, in collaborations and on stage?
Our individual bios can be found in our websites.

 Transparency...

Minimal budget for the show at Jersey City Theater Center March 19-April 3
Sally's costs:Travel - $950Accommodation - $400Food - $150Local transport - $120 (Metro in NY + Path train card)Tuva's costs:- Path-train card - $60
Production costs:Set design - $300Videographer - $200Photographer - $100Transportation (gas) - $20
Additional unforeseen costs - $200

Total sum: $2500 Impact
The sexual abuse and intimate partner violence rate in US is incredibly high and in the rest of the world it is not better.  In Sweden girls are burnt out from high performance in school before they have even finished high school. People are taught today to value individual performance more than collective actions and community. It is a fact that advertising is successful because it feeds on giving women (and men) low-self esteem. The way women of all ethnicities are portrayed in advertising and music videos specifically affects women of all backgrounds; when the body is compared to an object everyday it leads to lack of empathy for the body and person and it contributes to violation of the body. We are fed from a young age with the information that a woman is lacking something (negative space) and that the man has something (positive space). When we did a survey with our friends as research, asking about their relationship to their vagina, four out of five women responded that they had experienced sexual abuse and therefore had a complex relationship with their pelvis and vagina. 
These are just a few of the facts that encourages us to do this project and that we want to change by spreading this show to a wider audience.



Risks & Challenges
We didn't have much time, but it was enough to pull this show together once again. Sally bought a flight ticket with money that she realistically didn't have, arrived to New York on March 19th, rehearsed the show and then had to go back to Sweden two weeks later to work. It is a wonderful, vulnerable, giving and playful experience to rehearse this show. Our major challenges are the practical aspects that a high budget theater usually can take care of, but that we also have to focus on at this stage of our career. A major obstacle is also the distance between us and that it is so expensive to travel between New York and Europe. The largest obstacle is the stress that can occur if we will anticipate to go minus and the consequences that will lead to. One consequence is that it could be very hard to continue with this project. A challenge is to get all the practical aspects, such as marketing, grants writing, videography, set design  together for each time we are invited to perform the piece. However, with your potential support, our hard work, tight schedule, will-power and enthusiasm, we will make it happen.

<p>When I was 3, I had my first ballet class and I have been in love with ballet ever since!  I am now almost 16 so I have been dancing almost all my life. I am currently receiving instruction in a performing classical studio and have performed in major productions such as The Nutcracker, The Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Peter and the Wolf, Coppelia, Hansel and Gretel and La Boutique Fantasque.</p>

<p>My Mom and Dad adopted me when I was just a few hours old and have loved, supported and encouraged me all along the way. They have believed in me and given me every opportunity to become the best I can be.</p>
<p>That is why I want to help other people.  Being adopted I have a better understanding of what children sometimes deal with in how they feel about themselves and how they look at life. </p>
<p>As a well trained ballerina, I want to help other kids through dance instruction to have a better self image, to begin to develop a sense of purpose and accomplishment, to see life through different lenses. Through dance they can develop a healthy expression of inner thoughts, conflicts and difficult issues they may be dealing with.</p>
<p>I currently have an invitation to come to Honduras to work with Street Reach as they help in the education of youth.  They have asked me to give dance instruction to the kids they work with.  I am also a student teacher for the younger dancers in my home studio as well as give private lessons to very young dancers before they join our studio.</p>
<p>Your support for me in this campaign will allow me to benefit from the premier ballet instruction I will receive at ABT this summer.  I will be taking classes for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week for 3 weeks.  That's why its called an <em>intensive!</em></p>

Who We Are
Just Like My Child Foundation™ is a San Diego-based 501(c)3 organization working with impoverished communities in rural Uganda and Senegal. 
Our goal is to transform humanity by empowering women and children to reach their full potential through a holistic system of health care, education, micro-enterprise, girls' empowerment and social justice.


Meet St. Joseph Magogo's Dance Troupe


We've worked with St. Joseph Magogo Primary School in the Luwero district of Uganda since 2010 through our Project Universal Education™ and Girl Power Project™.
In 2012, after witnessing firsthand the school's incredible culture of music and dance, we funded the purchase of musical instruments for the students.
At the beginning of August, they won the opportunity to compete in the Luwero District Music and Dance Competition, and won 9 out of 10 rounds.
From there, they went on to Regionals (which included 7 districts), where they won first place!


St. Joseph Magogo has earned the opportunity to compete at Nationals at the end of August, where it will be held in Kampala at the National Theater. This motivated school is drawing on the school development training they've received from us to hold a fundraising event where they will charge a small fee for a dress rehearsal performance. They are confident that the community will turn out to support this incredible opportunity. 

What They Need
This is a rural and impoverished community, and despite overwhelming support from the community members, it's unlikely the school will raise the amount of funds they need to go to Nationals:

$2000 will get the school of 250 children to Kampala and back for Nationals, including transporation, hotel, meals and other incidentals.
All funds raised will go directly to our on-the-ground Country Director, who will distribute the funds to the school Headmaster and report on each expenditure.



The Impact
St. Joseph Magogo's participation in the National Dance and Drama Competition will be a life-changing experience for the students and their families:

Students will get to see the capitol city of Kampala for the first time in their lives.
They will get to spend time with peers from an urban environment and practice many of the social skills they've learned through the Girl Power Project™.
It will increase their self-confidence tenfold – they put their whole heart and soul into dancing, and this will bring them incredible joy.
It will bring national recognition to their school, resulting in more opportunities for St. Joseph Magogo's teachers and students.

Iran. But one doctor from an Iranian hospital told the BBC that he alone carries out more
than 200 such operations every year.”</p>
<p>Death of the Persian Prince sheds light on this little-known topic by telling a very human story; this isn't a political issue-oriented play, but rather a powerful and emotional story of the human spirit. Howard Miller of Upstage-Downstage claimed, ""There is a tendency for plays with a strong social justice message to become pedantic and sanctimonious, but, truly, we do not come to the theater to be lectured to.  So double kudos to Mr. Moss for presenting this story through a naturalistic recounting of the story.""</p>

Death of the Persian Prince sheds light on this little-known topic by telling a very human story; this isn't a political issue-oriented play, but rather a powerful and emotional story of the human spirit. Howard Miller of Upstage-Downstage claimed, ""There is a tendency for plays with a strong social justice message to become pedantic and sanctimonious, but, truly, we do not come to the theater to be lectured to.  So double kudos to Mr. Moss for presenting this story through a naturalistic recounting of the story.""
We feel this is a moving story, and one that needs to be heard.

<p><a href=""http://rkdc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Regina Klenjoski Dance Company</a> has an excellent 14-year track record with its successful dance education program, ""Dancing with RKDC,"" in the city of Torrance, CA. RKDC has reached over 13,000 students since 1999, providing high-quality dance instruction at an affordable price to the South Bay, and is now ready to expand the program to a new community and bring it to the company's home town, Long Beach, CA.</p>
<p><b>THE NEED</b></p>
<p>In Long Beach, there is a documented need for dance and arts programs to serve underserved, underrepresented students in the region. RKDC is based in Long Beach and has held a long desire to expand its programs to its hometown. As the fifth largest city in California with 23% of its population at or below poverty level, most public schools and young people in the city are without arts programs.</p>
<p><b>THE MOMENT </b></p>
<p>We believe we are at the right moment at the right time to effectuate the change we have longed to bring to our home community for many years. We have proven that with start up funding we can develop a self sustaining arts education model that will thrive and grow in the community for years to come. As a 14-year veteran of programs in Torrance, Regina Klenjoski is uniquely positioned to be successful in this endeavor - she has the knowledge, maturity and community relationships that ensure success for the residents and children of Long Beach.</p>
<p><b>THE FUNDS </b></p>
<p>Regina Klenjoski Dance Company is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit company and all funds generated by this project will be used to hire, retain and pay high-caliber teaching artists for classes and in-school workshops and start up marketing costs that include a new ""LB Dancing with RKDC"" website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It will cost $5,420 to launch the program (Jan-March), but we've already secured $2,420. We need your help to raise the rest ($3,000) to bring this much needed access to arts education to downtown Long Beach. </p>

<p>With 14 years of experience in the South Bay, RKDC is prepared and equipped for launching a self-sustaining education program in Long Beach. To do this, RKDC must continue to bring the community together with the support of local partners and stakeholders to raise awareness of our program offerings.</p>
<p>RKDC has faculty lined up to begin instruction once the program opens, and an inherent challenge launching this program is being able to afford and maintain highly qualified teaching instructors.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Who is WISTA?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>WISTA, the <em>West Island Student Theatre Association</em>, is a non-profit organization founded in December 2006 as a way to allow post-secondary students to interact and perform in the wonderful world of musical theatre. </p>
<p>It is a school, a theatre company, a performance venue with dedicated volunteers and members, all with more than a passing interest in musical theatre and youth. WISTA is a member of the <a href=""http://www.quebecdrama.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Quebec Drama Federation</em></a> (QDF).</p>
<p>With an average of 700 audience members per show, WISTA is a very community oriented theatre group. We often perform at public events and celebration and in return we love to donate a portion of each show's proceeds to various Montreal charities. 
In the past, we've donated to charities such as the West Island Community Shares,
the Montreal Children’s Hospital and the Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>What makes us different? Musical theatre is what we do. It’s all we do. And we know you’ll love it.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>About H2$</h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</i> will be WISTA's 5th full-length musical production. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A satire of big business and all it holds sacred, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING follows the rise of J. Pierrepont Finch, who uses a little handbook called “How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying” to climb the corporate ladder from lowly window washer to high-powered executive, tackling such familiar but potent dangers as the aggressively compliant “company man,” the office party, backstabbing co-workers, caffeine addiction and, of course, true love.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Winner of the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING melds wit, comedy, and romance together to perfection.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>As we are a non-profit organization, WISTA does not receive any outside funding. Musical theatre is extremely expensive to put on, we rely on our cast members and program sponsors to help defray some of the costs<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. You can alleviate some of this stress by funding our project in exchange for some great perks.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> As a rapidly growing company, we are looking to grow not only in size but in quality. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For this production, WISTA needs $1,700 to build awesome sets and $1,500 to get costumes for <b>26</b> cast members. The money raised here will not cover all of our costume and sets needs but it will be a huge help and allow us to spend some our budget elsewhere (like our venue, lights and mics). This will also allow us to donate more to charity. Every little bit counts in making this our best production yet!</span></p>
<p>In return for your generosity, we have a bunch of awesome perks like tickets, pins, original songs, t-shirts and more! You can view the full list of perks on your right! --&gt;</p>

With an average of 700 audience members per show, WISTA is a very community oriented theatre group. We often perform at public events and celebration and in return we love to donate a portion of each show's proceeds to various Montreal charities. 
In the past, we've donated to charities such as the West Island Community Shares,
the Montreal Children’s Hospital and the Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation.
What makes us different? Musical theatre is what we do. It’s all we do. And we know you’ll love it.

About H2$

How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying will be WISTA's 5th full-length musical production. A satire of big business and all it holds sacred, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING follows the rise of J. Pierrepont Finch, who uses a little handbook called “How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying” to climb the corporate ladder from lowly window washer to high-powered executive, tackling such familiar but potent dangers as the aggressively compliant “company man,” the office party, backstabbing co-workers, caffeine addiction and, of course, true love.

Winner of the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING melds wit, comedy, and romance together to perfection.



Why We Need Your Help
As we are a non-profit organization, WISTA does not receive any outside funding. Musical theatre is extremely expensive to put on, we rely on our cast members and program sponsors to help defray some of the costs. You can alleviate some of this stress by funding our project in exchange for some great perks. As a rapidly growing company, we are looking to grow not only in size but in quality. 
For this production, WISTA needs $1,700 to build awesome sets and $1,500 to get costumes for 26 cast members. The money raised here will not cover all of our costume and sets needs but it will be a huge help and allow us to spend some our budget elsewhere (like our venue, lights and mics). This will also allow us to donate more to charity. Every little bit counts in making this our best production yet!
In return for your generosity, we have a bunch of awesome perks like tickets, pins, original songs, t-shirts and more! You can view the full list of perks on your right! -->

The Back Story



It all began with the book,
which I started working on about 3 years ago. At first, I set out to make a
mock fashion magazine. It ended up becoming a commentary on the cultural
imperative for women to achieve the unattainable “feminine” ideal. What a
humorous, confusing, and shocking series of revelations!  
Why do clothes define who we are?  And are we supposed to be demure and
well behaved, or provocative and sexy? Can we be both? Can we remain
eternally young and thin and also know how to
bake a great chocolate cake in 20 minutes?



I had to respond to all of these mixed messages in a multidimensional
way- with stories,  collage, couture, and movement... because some things
just can’t be said with words alone. I realized my best route to conveying and making
sense of the conflicting roles of women was to explore them in diverse media,
which is why I will present them together in one night. 

The Show!
Making the book was the first phase. The second phase is bringing the book to life in a performance.  It’s going to be a gorgeous, funny, and provocative night, featuring 25 performers. Fantastic guest artists from several Bay Area dance companies will be making appearances, along with the fabulous T Sisters, the singing trio out of Oakland.  Rounding out the show, we have mothers, accountants, corporate managers, teachers, designers, an attorney and a pediatrician.

the relationship between sisters.


 an association, society, or community of women linked by a common interest, religion, or trade.



Ideas for Three started brewing in September of 2014 over coffee in Queens.The three of us, Allison, Julia and Maddie, had just finished an epic project with renowned experimental theater director, Richard Schechner, and unsure of what to do next, we set out to devise our own project based on the subject we all knew best: sisterhood. 



The first workshop of Three was at NYU’s Experimental Theater Wing in May of 2015. Shortly after, it was selected to be part of the New Works Summer Reading Series at the Culture Project in downtown Manhattan. The second iteration of the play will be presented at Dixon Place on Monday, November 16, 2015.  Our Dixon Place showing will be geared toward inviting industry and theatre professionals who can help move ""Three"" to the next level.


We are looking to raise $2,000 to help give ""Three"" the fully-realized theatrical life it demands.  With your help and contributions, we will be able to make ""Three"" the best showcase it can be at our upcoming Dixon Place performance, but a substantial portion of the funds will be allocated for launching the project into its next phase.  Here's where your money goes:

-Set, costumes, props:  so that our play's visual aesthetic matches the uncompromising level of the work.
-Space and theatre rental fees:  nitty gritty stuff so that the play has a home, and homes in between as needed.


Three is truly a labor of sisterly love, and over the past year we have endured a lot as a trio: a cold Chekhovian winter, a sticky Mississippi summer, two Shakespearean tragedies, five seasons of The Brady Bunch, and 145 episodes of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. 


Sound bizarre? We can't wait to show you!

<p><i>Who are you?</i></p>
<p>The Aeneid Theatre
Company (ATC) is a new student theatre company devoted to independently
producing upstanding, non-musical plays at USC. Our third production of our
very first full season is already well underway: We've recently cast actors, established a creative team, and begun rehearsing Mary Zimmerman’s <span><i>The Secret
in the Wings.</i></span></p>
<p><i>What's that? </i></p>
<p><i>The Secret in the Wings </i>is a contemporary play featuring several playful yet frighteningly dark fairy tales interwoven in a unique, rhythmic structure. Set
in what is described as a basement with leaking colors of other more fantastical
locations, <i>The Secret In the Wings</i> is
a chance to re-live childhood fantasy and to regain a childlike sense of wonder
that is utterly <i>crucial</i> to our work
as theatre artists. In the words of Burt Chaikin, our director, “The play is
about what we fear and why. It shows that the things we’re most afraid of, we
don’t have to be, and the world can be what we want it to be, rather than what
we have accepted it as. Zimmerman shows us that our childlike spirits can often
be more courageous than our adult selves.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rather than trying to replicate some sort of thing that
already exists, Zimmerman dares us to <i>create</i>.
And the courage to <i>do</i> is an
invaluable trait we can impress upon young, learning actors. The rehearsal
process will teach actors how to be independent artists and how to take charge of their own ideas and
creative ambitions. We believe students will learn a lot from taking on an
entirely new style of acting, one not grounded in the Western obsession with
realism and authenticity, like they have been doing for most of their acting
careers thus far, but one grounded in self-conscious performativity,
presentation and archetype.</p>
<i>The Secret In the Wings</i> shows us why we dream, and emphasizes the
importance of doing so. Mary
Zimmerman teaches us in this play that the world can be a wondrous place if we
allow it to be, and includes the following quote at the beginning of her play, which summarizes it all:<p></p>
<p>“Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are
only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps
everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless
that wants our love.” —Rainer Maria Rilke</p>
<p><i>So what's the
Indiegogo page for?</i></p>
<p>The next step of this
creative process involves a monumentally important person: <b>You</b>.
Because this is our very first season, ATC is yet to fully acquire the funding
and support that other, long-standing production companies possess. We need a
little more assistance to get our company off the ground and onto the stage,
and contributors like you can make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>With your help, ATC

<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>

we do not raise the full $1,500.*</p>

What We Need & What You Get

Where does the money
go?
The production

fees, and other essentials for producing any kind of theatre. Any money raised

*Indiegogo claims 9%
of funds if fundraising does not meet the goal amount.
What do I get out of
this?
Firstly, you get
the knowledge that you've helped enrich the lives of countless students and theatre-lovers
in the USC community by helping produce a compelling work of art. 

But if you're looking for something a little more extrinsic, there are a few
unique perks involved in contributing to our cause:
· 
Every contribution of

· 
Every contribution of

The Impact

How
does this help in the big picture?
While USC has amazing

musicals and new works, there is no other student organization dedicated to regularly producing great, non-musical plays. Opening with our first full season this year, ATC

<p><strong>Why we want to produce <em>Mad Tom</em></strong>: While some productions leave me patting myself on the back, thinking myself even more insightful than before, I prefer a show that leaves me thinking I've landed on another planet. </p>
<p><em>Mad Tom</em> is that kind of play.  It opens on a family scene that rapidly exposes  deep fissures.  </p>
<p>Catchy Name produced this work as a one-act in the 2004 San Francisco Fringe Festival and then as a full-length at the SF Actors Center, directed by Steve Budd and starring Josh-Sternin Moser, Nancy Lawson, Belle Borovik, Rob Witowski and Doug Marshall.  </p>
<p>Edward Nattenberg and Jim Strope have been working the script, making the hard-hitting play even stronger.  </p>
<p><strong>Jim Strope</strong></p>
<p>Founder and resident writer, software engineer, backpacker and man-about-town, Jim will stop at nothing to deliver sensational dramatic art with a dark, comic, and claustrophobic philosophic underlayment.  Life is short.  Death is long.  Be all you can be.  Work for peace.  Prepare for the worst.  And most of all, count yourself lucky to be working with Edward Nattenberg! </p>
<p><strong>Edward Nattenberg</strong></p>
<p>Our director, Edward Nattenberg, builds his life around stage.  He is  amazingly talented and honest and persistent in his dramaturgy.  The cast members will follow him anywhere.  His education, acting experience, brilliant textual analysis, devotion to action and dynamic personality attract the very best actors in the SF Bay area. They want to work with us.  </p>

Why we want to produce Mad Tom: While some productions leave me patting myself on the back, thinking myself even more insightful than before, I prefer a show that leaves me thinking I've landed on another planet. 
Mad Tom is that kind of play.  It opens on a family scene that rapidly exposes  deep fissures.  
Catchy Name produced this work as a one-act in the 2004 San Francisco Fringe Festival and then as a full-length at the SF Actors Center, directed by Steve Budd and starring Josh-Sternin Moser, Nancy Lawson, Belle Borovik, Rob Witowski and Doug Marshall.  
Edward Nattenberg and Jim Strope have been working the script, making the hard-hitting play even stronger.  
Jim Strope
Founder and resident writer, software engineer, backpacker and man-about-town, Jim will stop at nothing to deliver sensational dramatic art with a dark, comic, and claustrophobic philosophic underlayment.  Life is short.  Death is long.  Be all you can be.  Work for peace.  Prepare for the worst.  And most of all, count yourself lucky to be working with Edward Nattenberg! 
Edward Nattenberg
Our director, Edward Nattenberg, builds his life around stage.  He is  amazingly talented and honest and persistent in his dramaturgy.  The cast members will follow him anywhere.  His education, acting experience, brilliant textual analysis, devotion to action and dynamic personality attract the very best actors in the SF Bay area. They want to work with us.

</div></div>","Crowdfunding Or, The Whale:A Salty DialogueTo pitch our fundraising campaign, we sat down with Captain Peleg, a retired whaler grown wealthy from his investments in the oil and spermaceti trade. This is what transpired. CAPTAIN PELEG:  Ahoy there!ZACH AND ROSA: Good day to you, Captain! We're Zach and Rosa, the founders of Strange Harbor. CP: Avast! What strange harbor might that be? Constantinople? Fiji? Or San Francisco?!Z&R: Actually, ""Strange Harbor"" is the name of our theater company. We take classic texts like Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick and turn them into new plays like Or, The Whale. We want to explore this complex narrative to discover a fresh side of a resonant and captivating story. CP: So ye're whalers I see. No petty merchant service service for ye. But flukes! Moby Dick, did ye say? The mightiest whale fish in all great Neptune's ocean! What sort of crew have ye, what strong backs to pull the oars and stout hearts to hurl the spear?Z&R: Zach's directing and Rosa's dramaturgy would be sunk without the work of Strange Harbor's Associate Artists, and we're proud to have a great cast and creative team behind this project, including all the handsome fellows in our video. CP: Sunk ye'd be indeed without such a fine crew, but ye'll never launch upon the vasty deep without a ship! Ye must rig a swift vessel to catch that white demon of a whale.Z&R: Right you are! We're performing in a majestic, wood-paneled hall in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The exact location is a secret, but we'll send you the coordinates when you reserve your tickets. CP: A secret ship! This is a strange harbor indeed. But why hide ye the name of yer craft? Didst not steal it, did ye? Perdition's flames! Are ye pirates?!Z&R: Not at all! In fact, that's where you come in. We only expect to make about half of our total budget at the box office, so we need help from people like you to cover our upfront costs like renting space to rehearse, buying props and costume pieces, and marketing our show in print and online. Any contribution you can make toward our project will be a big help and, since we're a fiscally sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization, all or part of your contribution will be tax-deductible!CP: Tax-deductible, ye say? That's mighty interesting. And I'd help ye chase yer whale, too! That might be worth a cruise about the harbor, however strange it be. But I'm a whaling man, and ye need a big fish to tempt the likes o' me to make a three years' voyage 'round the globe! What have ye got to make me wager a purse of spanish doubloons on yer success? What prizes have ye?Z&R: We've got some great rewards for our donors. We'll send everyone who gives $10 or more a hand-written thank-you postcard with a unique nautical design. If you give $25, we'll send you a discount code for 1/3 off the price of a ticket, and for $50 we'll send you codes for a pair of tickets plus a pack of ten blank nautical postcards to send to your friends. Donors of $100 or more also get a limited edition, professionally printed copy of our original script signed by the cast and crew. For $250 and above we're offering complimentary premium reserved seats and a Producer credit, and $500 also gets you a custom-made stamp kit, complete with blank stationary, an ink pad in the color of your choice, and a personalized stamp hand-crafted here in New York!

Plus, as a fiscally sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization, all donations beyond the value of the reward are tax-deductible!
CP: By Jonah, what a catch! She'll fetch quite a price in our Nantucket market. But the longer the voyage the greater the haul! How far will ye venture before ye return to port?
Z&R: We need at least $3000 to rent rehearsal and performance space, but if we raise more we can add more to the show the fancier refreshments and production values. We’ll also be able to give our donors special secret rewards. That’s why we've got...


Help the Pequod (Ahab's trusty ship) reach her final destination by stretching past our starting goal. $3000 helps us launch out of the harbor, and every additional $500 puts more wind in our sails and charts a new reward for our contributors. 
$3000, THE OPEN SEA: Free grog for all! Every good captain knows that whaling is thirsty work, so we'll serve hearty complimentary refreshments to the audience at every performance if we make our initial goal. 
$3500, THE ATLANTIC OCEAN: Unknown. Who can tell what lies beneath the whale fisheries of yore?
$4000, THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE: Unknown. Untold riches await those who can brave the storms of old ""Tormentoso."" 
$4500, THE INDIAN OCEAN: Unknown. Countless merchant ships cross these waters, laden with treasures from the East. But so do pirates. 
$5000, THE SEA OF JAPAN: Unkown. Here be dragons, they say. 



CP: But what reward will ye give yer supporters if ye pass the open sea? A pot of Nantucket chowder? A weekend of shore leave? An ounce of Quito gold? Tell me quick!
Z&R: Not so fast, Captain! You'll have to help us make our goal before you find out what stretch rewards we're offering. But we can tell you we're very excited about them and what they'll add to our show!
CP: Blast! More secrets! Then tell me, where can I turn for more about ye and yer crew? What maps and charts, what almanacs?

CP: I see ye've charted an ambitious course. But what shall I do if my ships are sunk and my cargo lost? How can a penniless sailor fly his colors for ye?

Puppet artists present works with unique viewpoints that differentiate themselves from mass media. Working with children, teens, and adults allows for many opportunities to find one's unique voice -- sometimes without even uttering a single word! So many styles of puppetry -- rod, shadow, hand, marionette, and object puppets -- to explore! And there are many entry ways into puppetry: building puppets, performing with puppets, playwriting for puppetry. So many opportunities for young people to shine on stage -- even if they don't want to act or memorize lines.<br/><br/>We are easing into this in a responsible way -- in the same way, for example, that <a href=""http://www.theatrelabrva.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TheatreLAB</a> and <a href=""http://rvacomedy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Richmond Comedy Coalition</a> grew organically, performing in venues throughout Richmond for several years before opening up their own spaces. This seems smart. We are starting with our Winter Puppetfest for Families from December 26th-Jan 3rd. (There will be FIFTEEN shows!) Then we will be having a regular series of shows INCLUDING a Puppet Slam for adult audiences and other unique theatrical offerings from puppet artists.<br/><br/>To do this right (and legally...), we need to have some ""basic"" infrastructure. Things like a website (it's almost done!), phone number, ticketing system, facility rental, posters, promotional/marketing, insurance, and other ""stuff"" necessary to be a legal entity in the state of Virginia. Oh, there is also the need for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_%28theater%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a mud wrestling ring and wrestlers outside the dressing room and other requests that might be made by touring artists.</a> (OK, that bit was just to see if you are paying attention!) But this is why we are raising funds. It's a lot to do, but it IS worth it!<br/><br/><span>We
 have a long list of aspirations and goals that includes regular family 
programming, performances for adults that range from the silly (like 
Puppet Slams) to the sublime, workshops, classes, a special film series 
(wouldn't that be fun when the Byrd gets those new seats?), and even a 
puppet camp! We have big plans for RVA that are born of what we have 
learned from visiting and experiencing rich puppetry scenes in other 
cities. We have seen how puppetry and theatre have transformed 
neighborhoods, lives, and communities. We hope to give the same to 
Richmond. </span><br/><br/><b>Question: But what are you doing with this money, anyway?</b><br/><br/>We want to keep ticket prices to $10 each and your donation helps make this possible.  Performance costs include the venue, sound, lighting, tickets, Richmond City admissions tax, paying performers, travel for performers, and all the other legal hoopla! Typically, when you buy a ticket in any theatre, a good bit of the cost is underwritten by fundraising. In addition, if we meet our goals we will be able to give tickets to children and families who would not otherwise be able to see live theatre.<br/><br/><b>Question: Why did you pick Richmond Triangle Players as your venue? Is this where you will always be performing?</b><br/><br/>Puppetry is best seen in somewhat intimate spaces where the audience size is under 150 persons. The space inside Richmond Triangle Players (RTP) is beautiful and perfectly laid out for puppetry. Also, Phil Crosby, the managing director, is just fabulous and incredibly supportive of the theatre community in RVA (THANK YOU!) During winter break, RTP is ""dark"" -- there is nothing scheduled. But this is not usually the case! RTP has a busy, busy schedule. There are some possible dates, but we are currently exploring other spaces in Richmond, too. Our fundraising will dictate much of our planning. If we hit our goal, then we will have a much easier time securing spaces for the rest of the 2015 season.<br/><br/><b>Question: So...these are kids shows right? Like for two-year-olds?</b><br/><br/>Well, not really ""just"" kids. We envision a full series of shows that will provide variety: different styles of puppetry and different target audiences. Yes -- even adult! Believe it or not, in most of the world, puppetry is a form of theatre aimed at adult audiences. Throughout Japan, China, Europe, Canada, Australia, and the Americas! We want to bring shows that introduce Richmond audiences to the fullness of this medium that is both ancient and fully modern.<br/><br/>But, yes, there will be family shows! This is our kick-off: RVA Winter Puppetfest! Most of the time, shows for families are best suited for ages 4 and up. Toddlers are mostly meant to, well, toddle and move about! But this is a wonderful way to introduce younger children to theatre. Some shows may be appropriate for 2-3 year olds, but the greater number of family shows are targeted at ages 4-10 and their parents, grandparents, and caregivers. Having said that, we don't check your child's ID at the door, and we trust that parents will use their best judgment! Puppet playwrights who write for family audiences work hard to create ""layers"" within a show so that all of the audience members (not just the children) can enjoy the show. This is a wonderful way for families to enjoy time together.

A meditation on loss, desire and labor, the work functions as a transformative space, a container for conjuring trauma-ghosts, dress up, confessionals, boredom, and future-play, and takes place inside a large pile of fur. This work features live musical accompaniment and sound design by Xenia Rubinos (ANTI Records).

Kate Watson-Wallace (co-director, anonymous bodies) is a choreographer, director and visual artist based in Brooklyn, NY. She creates experimental performance for the stage, site-based locations, and music videos.

She is a 2007 Pew Fellow in the Arts in choreography. She has choreographed music videos for Animal Collective and Black Dice and created devised performance work with electronic composers Christopher Sean Powell (ManMan), HPrizm (Anti-pop Consortium), and RYAT (Brainfeeder). Watson-Wallace has toured internationally as a performer, choreographer, and guest lecturer and been a guest artist at a variety of universities/venues nationally, most recently at Summerstage Central Park. She has co-curated music and performance events with curator Jaamil Olawale Kosoko and electronic composer/DJ King Britt.

Xenia Rubinos

Visionary singer and music maker Xenia Rubinos dips in and out of genre and structure to create movingly powerful songs with her O.G. signature sound. Xenia’s powerhouse vocals are at the center of her music which grows from a wide range of influences from R&B to Hip-Hop to jazz all delivered with a soulful punk aura. Pitchfork lauded the radiant singer as “a unique new pop personality” while The New Yorker described her work as “rhythmically fierce, vocally generous music that slips through the net of any known genre”. Rubinos eventually landed in Brooklyn where she released her debut album Magic Trix in 2013 and subsequently toured North America & Europe swiftly winning over fans through the visceral power of her live show. In June 2016 the signer will release her full length sophomore LPBlack Terry Cat.

And we've built almost all of it ourselves, thanks to you! We continue to do a DIY show that is all-ages and free to the public, even as costs increase. Your continued support allows our core ethos to flourish. It means so much to us. The remains FREE TO ATTEND, even as we mount mammoth costs.

We witnessed an apocalyptic landscape where machines ruled, and wrestling was illegal. We fought hard and dispelled this nightmare - reclaiming the Partyweight Belt for the forces of Flesh. However, we now find ourselves BACK in 2017 - now the present - and the belt is once again in the hands of those who would subjugate flesh and exalt metal. The dark, cybernetic dystopia we thought we had escaped has come true! Dan ""the Man"" Ziglar has taken back the Partyweight Belt - and he hides behind a powerful robot - DEEPSLAM. HELLSPORT INC, Dan's sponsor and our resident diabolical corporation, has made all wrestling illegal - and has overrun the streets with vicious SLAMBOTS.

HELL RIGHT<br/><br/>Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:</p><ul>
<li><p>Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a SPARKLING, FROZEN POWERSCAPE by their selfless, capable hands. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p></li>
<li><p>Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying artists. We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.</p></li>
<li>Flying Tim Faust to Austin. Our emcee, friend and manager no longer lives in Austin, so we're helping him with his plane ticket.</li>
<li>Projection and lighting. Huge audiences compel us to try to use every part of our venue—so that all audience members can find a comfortable view of the show. We're removing our standing light poles and replacing them with more ceiling-mounted lighting. This will free up more space on the ground and make the lighting even sharper! PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. </li>
<li><p>Profit sharing: Our performers literally put their lives on the line FOR FREE. Everyone performs for PWR out of pure love. However, if we EXCEED our Indiegogo total, we combine that with profit from our sales at the merch table. After meeting any additional costs we've incurred, we invest 20% back into PWR and then split the rest among all our staff who worked on the show. We give performers a ""double share"" of this profit sharing in order to reflect their artistic contribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Training: Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  </p></li>

<p><br/></p>
<p>We have been invited to create and perform a piece of theatre in the beautiful village theatre Piccolo Teatro Della Concordia, in Montecastello di Vibio. (Umbria, Italy) in July 2011. This is an incredible opportunity for us to collaborate with and share a unique experience with the local village community and raise international awareness of its theatre and its work. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<span lang=""EN-GB"" style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Gill Sans Light"";'></span>
<p>We are devising a piece called 'Narciso';  inspired by the myth of Echo and Narcissuss, our play will draw
on themes of inexpressible love; owning one’s image and finding your voice 
and
losing it. Our performance will be a playful exploration of the meeting of two cultures and languages and, moreover, a celebration of diverse visual traditions. We are using live music, hand drawn animations, kinetic set sculptures and snippets of dance to tell our tale!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>'Narciso' aims to respond completely to Montecastello's local culture, custom and 
traditions and re-ignite the idea of the traditional travelling
 Italian theatre troupe!  One of our artists is a native from the nearby
 village and we are using this insight to inform a culturally resonant 
and sensitive piece, that engages with the local community at every level. With your help we aim to spend three weeks out there, creating the set from all local materials and working with local companies to promote and celebrate the collaboration. We currently have sponsorship and support from local Agriturismos (locally run holiday homes) and interest from the local press! <br/></p>

<h3>Our Story.</h3>hi!  <br/>Brought together by invitation to an experimental cross-discipline 2-day workshop a few weeks ago, this courageous team of ours strives to share with Japanese audiences the need, importance, and fun of improvisation.  We are all professional artists with international standing:  IMPRO Works, Japan's longest running Improvisation group led by award winning actress and author <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Yuri Kinugawa</span>, CONTACT IMPROVISATION JAPAN Group C.I.co directors Madam <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Chico Katsube</span> and Madam <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Shoko Kashima</span>, Shakespeare theater actor <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kochi Hirokazu</span>,  dancer and performing artist <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sadira Aryan Smith</span>, and others active in the Japanese theater scene.

<p>This project is about VOICE.  Here VOICE has two meanings:</p>
<p>Voice as a function of communication;</p>
<p>Voice as an opinion based on life experiences, feelings, and thoughts which one feels the need to share.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Japan is in an environmental and social crisis and needs outlets for true expression, especially now more then ever.  The country is left in the dark about so many civic issues - as is true all around the world - but the Edo culture of suppressed individuality still holds true and large, making it a struggle towards developing the VOICE, an agent for generating change.   The spread and practice of improvisation - where you strive to develop your own voice -  and contact improvisation, where you meet your true self without escape, can help guide the country towards asking for what it needs without waiting for approval from a system of pervasive hierarchy.  Improvisation is about making your own decisions, while taking into consideration your environment. You don't know where the road will take you, but taking a chance is a sign of 'life'.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<p>The 4 performances, each 1 1/2 hour long, will take place throughout December at a small, but expensive!!! theater venue in Tokyo, Japan.  They are all expensive.  There are 12 performers.   $4400, in consideration of the current exchange rate, will go towards total support of the efforts of the team:  an equal honorarium for each cast member and production team member (12), per diem, and transportation. Rehearsals for the event are 4-5 hr. improvisation sessions, where we get to know each other a bit better and share/exchange information from each of our worlds -- that is the dance world and the theater (engeki) world. However, the performances will be entirely improvisation.<br/></p>
<p>This in an artistic venture and all performers are looking forward to the challenge of leaving their comfort zones. The space is a typical venue for small band and theater shows , i.e. small, so dancers have an extra challenge!  <br/></p>
<p>Friends, Supporters, and Donors will receive goods and recognition from IMPRO-WORKS, CICO, RICO, and the Tokyo area!</p>
<p>There exists almost NO government support for professional artistic ventures in Japan.  In addition, the cost of renting venues is astronomical.  
If the international community supports us in professional, artistic 
ventures, perhaps the government will follow.</p>

<p><strong>Something Wicked</strong> is a fast-paced 2D side-scroller combat game that immerses the player in the story of William Shakespeare’s gory, witchy tragedy, <i>Macbeth</i>. <strong>Something Wicked</strong> complements any 6–12 grade curriculum, and it’s also fun to play on its own. Prior knowledge of <i>Macbeth</i> is not required.</p>
<p>Good to know: This campaign will raise funds to build a five-minute battle sequence enacting <a href=""http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/?chapter=5&amp;play=Mac&amp;loc=line-1.2.0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Captain’s monologue in Act 1 Scene 2</a>. Why does 1.2 make a great first step? <a href=""http://wp.me/p7Ctcd-35"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a> to read our not-short rationale.</p>
<p>How do you play? Players are Macbeth, battling through enemies as described in the monologue. Reading the monologue isn't necessary to win, but players can win faster if they check out the text. We also use game mechanisms inspired by the text to illustrate important themes like ambition, bloodlust, and the illusion of free will.</p>
<p>For example, to recharge Macbeth's bloodlust meter, players have to kill some kerns and gallowglasses (hired soldiers) and then step through their pools of blood. Why?? Because of 3.4.139–41: “<strong>I am in blood / Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o’er.</strong>”</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates throughout the campaign as we reveal more about these mechanisms.</p>
<p>For now, feast your orbs on this rendering by artist/animator Paul Sullivan to see our aesthetic.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474113968/cr5b8p9lfmafagxt43ca.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here's Macbeth, ready for battle:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474114250/svn8ghxgsb62wxkpp0c3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our visual inspiration is the legendary Bayeux Tapestry, created in the late Medieval era, which depicts the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i> is set in about the same era as the Battle of Hastings.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474114308/f3lk0idb0uswhjl9jxm7.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our artist/animator Paul notes, ""This piece of art has a unique style and textural quality that instantly felt like a perfect fit for this game.""</p>
<p>He plans to animate figures like well-controlled marionette puppets, with a fluid but wonky movement to them. Though purposefully jerky, animations will be fast and fluid, giving the player the ability to quickly and satisfying transition from action to action.</p>

<p>While it’s also a super fun mini-game, the primary goal for <strong>Something Wicked</strong> is to help students/teachers/humans understand/enjoy/think critically about <i>Macbeth</i>. So everyone (with a PC or an emulator) will get to access this first version for free.</p>
<p><strong>SHORT RUN:</strong> Contributing helps students (+ teachers + assorted humans) with a difficult subject (Shakespeare) that shuts out a lot of folks. And it gives people who already love Shakespeare the chance to ""be"" Macbeth.</p>
<p><strong>LONGER RUN:</strong> Contributing supports our experiment to improve critical thinking and literature education in general by harnessing the popularity of video games.</p>
<p>Donation-specific goodies are listed in our rewards section.</p>
<p>(This project also has a lot to say about alternative performance platforms and destabilizing the authority of the text in Shakespeare performance studies and a generative approach to humanities research so if you'd like to nerd out about all that academese HMU in the contact section bc I could talk for HOURS)</p>

<p>PROJECT DIRECTOR: <strong>Elizabeth Hunter</strong></p>
<p>That's me! I cooked up <strong>Something Wicked</strong> as part of my theatre PhD at Northwestern University. Before I came to Northwestern, I started <a href=""http://shakespeareatsloss.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a live theatre Shakespeare project at a restored blast furnace in Alabama</a>. Among my career highlights, most important to <strong>Something Wicked</strong> is the time I spent as a classroom teacher. I’ve been on the front lines of teaching Shakespeare’s plays to a range of students, so I know the challenges these plays pose for a contemporary classroom. <a href=""https://shakespearevideogame.wordpress.com/about/who-we-are/elizabeth-hunter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out my bio</a> for the full picture.</p>
<p>LEAD DESIGNER: <strong>Doris Rusch</strong></p>
<p>Doris C. Rusch is a game designer, researcher, play aficionado and holds a position as assistant professor at DePaul University. Before that she did post doctoral work at GAMBIT Game Lab, MIT, and Vienna University of Technology (Austria). Rusch’s work is focused on the theory and practice of game design, particularly in regard to games that model the “human experience,” create empathy and can be used for mental health activism. She was the lead designer and vision holder of award-winning and featured projects such as “<a href=""http://playforchange.cdm.depaul.edu/projects/zombie-yoga/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zombie Yoga”</a> for Kinect, “<a href=""http://gambit.mit.edu/loadgame/elude.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elude</a>,” a metaphorical game on depression, “<a href=""http://playforchange.cdm.depaul.edu/projects/for-the-records/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">For the Records</a>,” an interactive documentary that deals with young adults and mental disorders such as OCD, ADD, eating disorder, and bipolar disorder and “<a href=""http://playforchange.cdm.depaul.edu/projects/soteria/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soteria – Dreams as Currency</a>,” a game to teach strategies to overcome anxiety disorders. <a href=""https://shakespearevideogame.wordpress.com/about/who-we-are/doris-rusch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out her full bio</a> for more details.</p>
<p>CO-DESIGNER + PROJECT MANAGER: <strong>Mischa Hiessboeck</strong></p>
<p>Mischa is an Austrian filmmaker and game designer who lives and teaches in Chicago, IL. He advises budding game designers to ""Play games (video games, card games, board games), at least 3 times. Maybe not the complete game but sections that impressed you. The first time let the game entertain you, the second time dissect the game. And the third time game it!""</p>
<p>ARTIST/ANIMATOR: <strong>Paul Sullivan</strong></p>

<p>For the last three years, I’ve been workshopping <strong>Something Wicked</strong> in design, serious games, and learning science courses at Northwestern. The game evolved out of the educational programming arm of my <a href=""http://www.shakespeareatsloss.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live theatre Shakespeare project in Alabama.</a> Got six minutes? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gI7iFxx9SU&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out a 6-minute documentary</a> of an educational workshop here (it should be shorter, with better text scroll).</p>
<p>In these workshops, we noticed that, in addition to significantly improved plot comprehension, students demonstrated much more robust critical thinking about the play. Most important to me, though, was how much the students started liking Shakespeare. With neuroscientists now confirming that “<a href=""http://nyti.ms/1UytFhb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It is literally neurobiologically impossible to think deeply about things that you don’t care about</a>,” finding a way to get students emotionally invested in the work is imperative.</p>
<p>Creating live theatre taps into the emotions. The adrenaline of applause, the time pressure of entrances, the risk of forgotten lines, and the thrill of temporarily inhabiting a personality or a world that isn’t yours are all intoxicating. But live theatre does not scale.</p>
<p>Today’s school budgets + time are too skinny for regular Shakespeare workshops led by experienced theatre folk. So I asked what elements of live theatre I could leverage to reap the benefits of increased comprehension, critical thinking, and affinity that our workshops created—in a form scalable to students everywhere?

<p>In addition to finding courses to support these ideas, I was selected for Northwestern’s Teaching Certificate Program, which sharpened my pedagogy in the classroom and in the design of a digital learning tool. I also won a Segal Design fellowship to spend a quarter prototyping <strong>Something Wicked</strong> with a theatre and a computer science department mentor.

<p>Building a video game comes with its own set of challenges and risks. Here's our plan to address some of the most common:</p>
<p>VIDEO GAMES CAN GET BOGGED DOWN IN DEVELOPMENT. To counter this common challenge, we've scoped Something Wicked down to a five-minute mini game. We've also chosen a streamlined visual design in 2D, going for a heavy dose of stylized symbolism rather than expensive, time-consuming realistic 3D. It's all we need to test our theories about video games as great learning tools for complex literature like Shakespeare.</p>
<p>GAME DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING TEAMS CAN FALL APART. This common risk is most dangerous when people aren't getting paid, and haven't worked together before. Countering this risk is the reason we chose ""fast"" and ""good,"" and not ""cheap"". We also chose folks Doris works with regularly, so they're known entities with a proven track record and an existing relationship. As in every aspect of life: it's about the relationships.</p>
<p>DIGITAL PROJECTS HAVE TECH SNAFUS. There's no avoiding this challenge in building a video game. Our super-small scope, combined with a reasonable timeline that includes a good bit of buffer for bug fixes, is our safeguard against major tech issues. We're also building on Unity, a stable engine, and only going for a standard PC platform--if we tried to build it for web or mobile or universal access, we'd tack on many more costly months of fighting with technology.

</div></div>","TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

The sections below are:
THE GAME: describes the project (SPOILER: it's a 5-minute enactment of a battle description from Act 1 Scene 2 of Macbeth)
THE LOOK: our artist/animator's visuals
WHAT DO I GET: even though this first version is a free download, you can choose stuff &/or blessings for supporting
THE TEAM: why this game is actually going to get built
TIMELINE + BUDGET: ... timeline and budget
THE HISTORY: where the idea came from + why it's important
RISKS + CHALLENGES: every project has 'em
HOW TO HELP: contribute, share, or—even better—both!
 

Something Wicked is a fast-paced 2D side-scroller combat game that immerses the player in the story of William Shakespeare’s gory, witchy tragedy, Macbeth. Something Wicked complements any 6–12 grade curriculum, and it’s also fun to play on its own. Prior knowledge of Macbeth is not required.
Good to know: This campaign will raise funds to build a five-minute battle sequence enacting the Captain’s monologue in Act 1 Scene 2. Why does 1.2 make a great first step? Click here to read our not-short rationale.
How do you play? Players are Macbeth, battling through enemies as described in the monologue. Reading the monologue isn't necessary to win, but players can win faster if they check out the text. We also use game mechanisms inspired by the text to illustrate important themes like ambition, bloodlust, and the illusion of free will.
For example, to recharge Macbeth's bloodlust meter, players have to kill some kerns and gallowglasses (hired soldiers) and then step through their pools of blood. Why?? Because of 3.4.139–41: “I am in blood / Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o’er.”
Stay tuned for updates throughout the campaign as we reveal more about these mechanisms.
For now, feast your orbs on this rendering by artist/animator Paul Sullivan to see our aesthetic.

Here's Macbeth, ready for battle:

Our visual inspiration is the legendary Bayeux Tapestry, created in the late Medieval era, which depicts the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Shakespeare's Macbeth is set in about the same era as the Battle of Hastings.

Shakespeare's Macbeth is set in about the same era as the Battle of Hastings.

Our artist/animator Paul notes, ""This piece of art has a unique style and textural quality that instantly felt like a perfect fit for this game.""
He plans to animate figures like well-controlled marionette puppets, with a fluid but wonky movement to them. Though purposefully jerky, animations will be fast and fluid, giving the player the ability to quickly and satisfying transition from action to action.
Check out the Something Wicked blog to read more about the process Paul used to create the different fabric textures.


While it’s also a super fun mini-game, the primary goal for Something Wicked is to help students/teachers/humans understand/enjoy/think critically about Macbeth. So everyone (with a PC or an emulator) will get to access this first version for free.
SHORT RUN: Contributing helps students (+ teachers + assorted humans) with a difficult subject (Shakespeare) that shuts out a lot of folks. And it gives people who already love Shakespeare the chance to ""be"" Macbeth.
LONGER RUN: Contributing supports our experiment to improve critical thinking and literature education in general by harnessing the popularity of video games.
Donation-specific goodies are listed in our rewards section.
(This project also has a lot to say about alternative performance platforms and destabilizing the authority of the text in Shakespeare performance studies and a generative approach to humanities research so if you'd like to nerd out about all that academese HMU in the contact section bc I could talk for HOURS)


PROJECT DIRECTOR: Elizabeth Hunter
That's me! I cooked up Something Wicked as part of my theatre PhD at Northwestern University. Before I came to Northwestern, I started a live theatre Shakespeare project at a restored blast furnace in Alabama. Among my career highlights, most important to Something Wicked is the time I spent as a classroom teacher. I’ve been on the front lines of teaching Shakespeare’s plays to a range of students, so I know the challenges these plays pose for a contemporary classroom. Check out my bio for the full picture.
LEAD DESIGNER: Doris Rusch
Doris C. Rusch is a game designer, researcher, play aficionado and holds a position as assistant professor at DePaul University. Before that she did post doctoral work at GAMBIT Game Lab, MIT, and Vienna University of Technology (Austria). Rusch’s work is focused on the theory and practice of game design, particularly in regard to games that model the “human experience,” create empathy and can be used for mental health activism. She was the lead designer and vision holder of award-winning and featured projects such as “Zombie Yoga” for Kinect, “Elude,” a metaphorical game on depression, “For the Records,” an interactive documentary that deals with young adults and mental disorders such as OCD, ADD, eating disorder, and bipolar disorder and “Soteria – Dreams as Currency,” a game to teach strategies to overcome anxiety disorders. Check out her full bio for more details.
CO-DESIGNER + PROJECT MANAGER: Mischa Hiessboeck
Mischa is an Austrian filmmaker and game designer who lives and teaches in Chicago, IL. He advises budding game designers to ""Play games (video games, card games, board games), at least 3 times. Maybe not the complete game but sections that impressed you. The first time let the game entertain you, the second time dissect the game. And the third time game it!""
ARTIST/ANIMATOR: Paul Sullivan
Paul earned his MA in animation at DePaul University, where he was the president of the DePaul Animation Lodge. Since graduating, he's been the lead artist/animator on Soteria and Red Cloud (in progress) at the Play for Change Lab, as well as animating hyper-realistic CG creatures for live action films. For more on Paul's weird and wonderful world, check out his online portfolio and his Something Wicked profile.
SOUND DESIGN: Andrew Edwards
Andrew is the owner of the Blue Police Box Music studio on Chicago’s north side, and an adjunct professor of film music at Columbia College. His compositions have been featured in several narrative feature and documentary films, web series, and podcasts. He created music and sound design for the indie video game Paper Wings, and for Soteria with DePaul’s Play for Change lab. Drew’s work in live theatre and concerts runs the gamut from incidental music to full-length concert pieces, in spaces ranging from the Chicago Tap Theatre to the Kennedy Center. Check him out online at bluepolicebox.com, and read his full bio on the Something Wicked website.
PROGRAMMERS: Don Herweg and Nick Segreti
Don is a current student at DePaul in programming and game development, and Nick is a recent grad of DePaul University with a BS in Game Development and a focus in gameplay programming. Nick has worked on projects that traveled to game showcases like Indie Prize and BitBash. For more on Don and Nick, check out their Something Wicked profile pages.

We’re ready to build now. We'll start in September, with a public release in early April 2017. Here's how the weeks will be spent: 


In the world of making stuff, there's GOOD, FAST, and CHEAP; each project can pick two. We picked the first pair ... and still came in (way) under market value. Making the mini-game will cost $10K. We've already got $5K secured and we're crowdfunding the other $5K. So where does it all go?


For the last three years, I’ve been workshopping Something Wicked in design, serious games, and learning science courses at Northwestern. The game evolved out of the educational programming arm of my live theatre Shakespeare project in Alabama. Got six minutes? Check out a 6-minute documentary of an educational workshop here (it should be shorter, with better text scroll).
In these workshops, we noticed that, in addition to significantly improved plot comprehension, students demonstrated much more robust critical thinking about the play. Most important to me, though, was how much the students started liking Shakespeare. With neuroscientists now confirming that “It is literally neurobiologically impossible to think deeply about things that you don’t care about,” finding a way to get students emotionally invested in the work is imperative.
Creating live theatre taps into the emotions. The adrenaline of applause, the time pressure of entrances, the risk of forgotten lines, and the thrill of temporarily inhabiting a personality or a world that isn’t yours are all intoxicating. But live theatre does not scale.

<p>We are a non-profit group of artists and friends that are incredibly passionate about Gravedigger: The Musical!</p>
<p>Gravedigger is fresh and raw and unlike anything you've seen before--but exactly what you've been wanting to see.</p>
<p>A group of us were lucky enough to be part of the world premiere of Gravedigger in San Francisco two years ago. We had such an incredible time and fell deeply in love with the unconventional style and story that we've been searching for the opportunity to put it up again and share it with a brand new audience. With your contribution, you will help cover the minimum needs our production needs to stay afloat, and the best part is that you'll be a part of producing a Chicago premiere. <br/><br/>We believe that theater is a gift that everyone deserves to have, that's why this show will be FREE for all audiences. Donations will be happily accepted (which we split with the theater hosting us) and all proceeds will be given to the actors. How sick is that?! </p>
<p>All we want is to be able to share this story that we love so much, with as many people as possible. We have the talent and the passion and the love that we need...we just need the money! Please consider giving $5, $10, $3500, whatever you can contribute to bring this show to life. You won't be disappointed. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Our Story and Backgrou<strong>nd</strong></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks so much for stopping by and considering us. My name is Jeff Eisenberg and I am the producer, composer and lyricist of<strong> MY PERFECT PET - The Musical</strong>. For more than 20 years I wrote, recorded and performed music for young audiences with the award winning group, Junior Jam. During that period, we won several awards for our recordings, including  National Parenting Publications Awards, Kids' Music Awards and Children's Music Web Awards.This was all very fulfilling, but, my first love was always the theater. I wanted to create a work that would introduce young children to the wonderment and joys of live theater. Thus, with the help of my co-writer, Bruce Robinson, we created, <strong>MY PERFECT PET</strong>, the story of Cailin, the soon to be 10 year old, who wants nothing more than a puppy dog for her upcoming 10th birthday. But, is she responsible and mature enough to receive this prized gift? Her parents will decide.</li>
<li>Our show was first presented as a staged reading over four years ago at <strong>The New York Musical Theater Festival</strong>, <strong>(NYMF)</strong> to highly enthusiastic audiences. We are now ready, with your help, to move forward with our first full-fledged production. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to present our labor of love this October at The Playroom Theater in New York City right off of Times Square.</li>
<li>Of course, there are many financial challenges in producing and staging a musical in New York.  From the theater rental to props, sets and costumes, to compensation for the creative team and actors, to fees for rehearsal time and promotion and marketing, there is so much to plan for and set in motion. Your financial support can help us better meet these challenges. In helping us, you can assist us in achieving our goal of presenting quality musical theater to young audiences ages 4-99.</li>
<li>Our show may be a child's first exposure to live theater. It can ignite a love for the arts, music and theater. In addition, our show deals with some important values revolving around commitment, responsibility, making choices, decision making, and empathy. Having worked with young children for over 30 years as a speech and language therapist, I've seen the impact and importance of the arts, in bringing to light important issues, in addition, to improving self-expression, self-esteem, enhancing language skills, and creativity. Your generous contribution can help us achieve many of these results.</li>

<div>Hello! My name is Dan Higgins and I am the Artistic Director/choreographer of Dan Higgins Dance, a project-based contemporary dance company located in Salt Lake City, UT. We are premiering our first evening length work, ""Declivity"", at The Salt Lake City Fringe Festival July 29-31, 2016. It is our mission as a group to contribute to the historic dance community here in Salt Lake City through innovative, physically challenging choreography and social commentary through movement.</div>
<div>""Declivity"" is the story of a group of people: a community that finds hope, encounters hardship, and encourages the audience to feel in a way it has been conditioned not to. This fracturing of cross-cultural understanding is the catalyst for the formation of Dan Higgins Dance, to form a choreographic outlet for us to examine society through an artistic lens.</div>
<div>Over the next two and a half months the 50 minute production will come to fruition through a rigorous physical and mental exploration of humanity. Dan Higgins Dance is comprised of 11 dance artists, myself included, all of whom will be involved in the behind the scenes production as well as performing. This includes, but is not limited to, rehearsals, costuming, artistic collaboration, and project promotion of ""Declivity"". There is an incredible amount of work that goes into the creation of dance art, not all of which can be done without financial assistance. This is where YOU, our friends, supporters, donors, families, and fans come in! With your generosity our goal of creating this important piece can become a reality! </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for your help in raising the $3,200 needed to make ""Declivity"" come to life. The contributions that you make to this campaign will go directly to funding this production through theater booking, festival registration costs and payment for the dance artists. Individual donors such as yourselves have become paramount in the creation of art across the nation due to recent cuts in government funding. In your hands rests the ability to help make exceptional and boundary breaking art accessible!</p>

<div><div>Our fundraising campaign is to develop our show <i>The Revenger’s Tragedy</i>, based on a play that was written in the 1600s and that has been produced only a handful of times throughout the last few centuries. <p></p>
<p>Our team are trying to raise $10,000 to develop this musical.  This money will be used to pay a playwright, composer and lyricist to create the new life of this story as well as a dozen or so actors to bring the new pages to life in a reading of the new work.  We are determined to create a groundbreaking and entertaining new piece of theatre to New York City, with the hope that it will expand in scope beyond his initial workshop. </p>
<p>Like many Jacobean dramas and tragedies, <i>The Revenger’s Tragedy </i>tells the story of what would happen if a tyrant was leading a corrupt government, or when the Church is corrupted and the citizens are fighting for change to the system.  The citizens rebel and take matters into their own hands, often finding vengeance against their leader or even each other.  It’s amazing that a play that is over 400-years-old is still relevant to today’s society. I don’t think we are trying to make a political statement with this musical, but the political message that this play speaks is stronger than ever and can continue to be relevant after this current election year.</p>
<p>Please help us reach our goal so we have a place to rehearse, great people to work with and so we can start getting the message out that speaks true to our hearts.  This play has not been heard the way we will be presenting it, and we're incredibly excited for this opportunity to share our vision with the world. </p>

<p>B is a first generation Brazilian girl living in London at home with her Mum and her two sisters. She’s got the worst hangover of her life, she’s been out all night, and she doesn’t want to go home and face the consequences last night: when over the loud music of a night club, her sisters find out that she’s working at a stripclub… or do they?</p>
<p><strong>Fuck You Pay Me</strong> is coming to <strong>Platform Southwark</strong> in November 2017 and this is why you gotta know about it:</p>
<p>Real reactions from audience who saw us at Brainchild Festival this year:</p>
<p><i>“A gripping insight into the world of stripping. Authentic, high energy and hilarious, beautifully performed. There's no show like it.”</i></p>
<p><i>""Joana's performance at Brainchild blew my mind and deepened my understanding of the paradoxes, ambiguities, and tragedies of life while making me laugh so much at them with her. Magnetic, genuine and funny as fuck.""</i></p>
<p>This project started out as a gut response to a city that only seemed to think about strippers in one of … what, four? ways? “Strippers got a tonne of money. Strippers got absolutely <i>no money</i>. Strippers got trafficked. Strippers run on coke, pink champagne and £50 notes alone. Strippers got daddy issues.”</p>
<p>For a little while I was wired on thinking, exploring and divining, and over the last year, I tested it as a play, as a stand up set, as poetry, as dance, as music, as visual art. Now I’ve got something good going, it’s called <strong>Fuck You Pay Me</strong>: 60 minutes of joy, mess, laughter and good vibes for and about our dear n darling stripper sisters. <strong>Fuck You Pay Me</strong> transcends the happy-hooker tragedy porn narrative in the media we are bored to tears with and now we’re ready to share it with you ... if you’d just throw a tiny bit of cash at us ;)</p>
<h3><strong>What we need</strong></h3>
<p>We need 8K. That sounds like a shittonne, but we don’t agree with the idea of artists working for free (do you?). We want to pay our collaborators industry minimum, so for your money and their time, we’re going to make something bangin’ that'll prick some bigwig ears, not just a jolly for my Mum to pat me on the back for then take me for a Pad Thai after, you feel me?</p>
<p>If you're curious, this is the breakdown:</p>

She’s got the worst hangover of her life, she’s been out all night, and she doesn’t want to go home and face the consequences last night: when over the loud music of a night club, her sisters find out that she’s working at a stripclub… or do they?
Fuck You Pay Me is coming to Platform Southwark in November 2017 and this is why you gotta know about it:
Real reactions from audience who saw us at Brainchild Festival this year:
“A gripping insight into the world of stripping. Authentic, high energy and hilarious, beautifully performed. There's no show like it.”
""Joana's performance at Brainchild blew my mind and deepened my understanding of the paradoxes, ambiguities, and tragedies of life while making me laugh so much at them with her. Magnetic, genuine and funny as fuck.""
This project started out as a gut response to a city that only seemed to think about strippers in one of … what, four? ways? “Strippers got a tonne of money. Strippers got absolutely no money. Strippers got trafficked. Strippers run on coke, pink champagne and £50 notes alone. Strippers got daddy issues.”
For a little while I was wired on thinking, exploring and divining, and over the last year, I tested it as a play, as a stand up set, as poetry, as dance, as music, as visual art. Now I’ve got something good going, it’s called Fuck You Pay Me: 60 minutes of joy, mess, laughter and good vibes for and about our dear n darling stripper sisters. Fuck You Pay Me transcends the happy-hooker tragedy porn narrative in the media we are bored to tears with and now we’re ready to share it with you ... if you’d just throw a tiny bit of cash at us ;)
What we need
We need 8K. That sounds like a shittonne, but we don’t agree with the idea of artists working for free (do you?). We want to pay our collaborators industry minimum, so for your money and their time, we’re going to make something bangin’ that'll prick some bigwig ears, not just a jolly for my Mum to pat me on the back for then take me for a Pad Thai after, you feel me?
If you're curious, this is the breakdown:
Equipment hire (lights, sound and music, including rehearsal): £4850
Production design and lighting design consultant: £610
Production (set, props, costume): £550
Marketing and publicity (photography, graphic design, production budgets for online collateral): £1270
Technical staff: £170
Music licensing: £110
Insurance, venue running and contingency: £390
Our rehearsal space and venue has been provided by our mates at Platform Southwark. We like Platform Southwark. Shit like that would usually cost around £3500, so they’ve saved a bit for you.

<li>Provide Bakery Hill - An Australian Rebellion as an educational resource for students &amp; schools across NSW and Australia to assist educators &amp; students in connecting with content surrounding the Eureka Rebellion.</li>
<li>Support venues to provide financial assistance through bookings and ticket sales.</li>
<li>Provide meaningful, quality connection, cultural experience and entertainment for the general public.</li>

<li>A full studio recording of the production with the original cast which can then be made available to you, the public and as a resource for others who wish to produce the production in the future.</li>
<li>The funds raised will allow us to produce high quality and historically accurate props and costumes to museum level quality, producing the most truthful and educational rendition of the story to date. </li>
<li>A complete video recording of the final production. The funds raised will go a long way to allowing us to produce a professional video recording of the live performance which we can use as promotion for future Yellow Line projects, as a resource for others wishing to produce the production and as a potential means of sharing the show with audience member who may miss out due to Covid-19 restrictions.</li>
<li>Due to restricted funds and the impacts of Covid-19, Bakery Hill is currently set to run for a limited season of 5 shows. With additional funding we have the option of extending the production season or hosting a second season.</li>
<li>Your donations will assist us in providing the safest possible environment for our personnel and for our audiences by allowing us to invest in the best quality personal protective equipment (PPE), disinfectant products and safety measures.</li>
<li>If we raise over our target amount, we will have the option of hosting a specialised educational season for primary and secondary students.

This will be achieved through curated Q&amp;A sessions after each show with the cast and creatives.</li>

Do you feel like it is still a story you know?Let us take you to Bakery Hill and under the light of the Southern Cross we will tell you what really happened. Why We Need You? We genuinely believe that Bakery Hill is a story that needs to be told, but like those at Eureka, we cannot do it alone. The effects of Covid-19 have impacted our ability to fundraise, cut our potential ticket sales by 50% and increased our costs due to the requirement for PPE and various precautionary measures to rehearse and perform safely. Despite the challenges presented by Covid-19, we believe that live theatre connects us all in a time when many have felt disconnected, brings us together in a time when many feel isolated and gives purpose to the thousands of artists and creatives who have felt lost and adrift due to the wide ranging effects of Covid-19.We feel like there has never been a more crucial time to reconnect, rebuild and share our stories with each other. With your help and support we will can: 
Provide crucial work and opportunities for many creatives.
Provide Bakery Hill - An Australian Rebellion as an educational resource for students & schools across NSW and Australia to assist educators & students in connecting with content surrounding the Eureka Rebellion.
Support venues to provide financial assistance through bookings and ticket sales.
Provide meaningful, quality connection, cultural experience and entertainment for the general public.
Share this important story from our past, a story that bears great relevance to our modern society, politics and culture.
Through collaboration and cross promotion, encourage and foster the recovery of the arts and many affiliated industries.
  How We Plan To Use Your Donation: We are looking to raise a total of $7,000 AUD.These funds will allow us to expand the quality and duration of our production season resulting in the following: 
A full studio recording of the production with the original cast which can then be made available to you, the public and as a resource for others who wish to produce the production in the future.
The funds raised will allow us to produce high quality and historically accurate props and costumes to museum level quality, producing the most truthful and educational rendition of the story to date. 
A complete video recording of the final production. The funds raised will go a long way to allowing us to produce a professional video recording of the live performance which we can use as promotion for future Yellow Line projects, as a resource for others wishing to produce the production and as a potential means of sharing the show with audience member who may miss out due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Due to restricted funds and the impacts of Covid-19, Bakery Hill is currently set to run for a limited season of 5 shows. With additional funding we have the option of extending the production season or hosting a second season.
Your donations will assist us in providing the safest possible environment for our personnel and for our audiences by allowing us to invest in the best quality personal protective equipment (PPE), disinfectant products and safety measures.
If we raise over our target amount, we will have the option of hosting a specialised educational season for primary and secondary students. Assisting students in a range of subjects including; History, English and Drama to better understand and connect with the story of Bakery Hill and learn about the full creative process. This will be achieved through curated Q&A sessions after each show with the cast and creatives.
 Every donation made will help us provide more work for creatives and tell both the story of Bakery Hill and future stories to the quality and standard that they, and you, deserve. The Challenges The primary challenge we need to overcome is the unforeseeable impacts of Covid-19.No one has to ability to know what the future will hold for April 2021 and although taking every precaution and preparation we cannot predict the unpredictable. So here are some of the things we are doing to help keep all of us and your investment safe: 
Open and regular consultation with our venue – Through a strong venue relationship we are able to continuously assess the situation and risks to preserve the financial interests of all involved.
If the production is required to cancel or delay to align with restrictions, we have an extensive system of asset protection and storage. This means that almost all of the material we create for the show (set, props, costumes, promotional materials) can be stored at no cost and reused at a later date to mitigate the financial impact.
If you wish to learn all about how we are managing the risks of Covid-19 you can view our Covid-19 Safety Plan on the Yellow Line Theatre website.
 Other Ways You Can Help Now more than ever before we can understand that people may not have the spare funds to donate to the arts.Don’t let that get you down because there are so many ways that you can help and support us if you like, and or, believe in our project.

We can’t think of a better place to showcase a PARTYWEIGHT BELT SHOWDOWN! </p><p>That’s right - our first one-on-one title match in NEARLY A YEAR will decide PWR’s greatest champion.

ALL UNRESOLVED TITLES WILL BE CHALLENGED! NEW TITLES WILL BE INTRODUCED! PARTY VIOLENCE WILL REIGN!</p><br/><br/><h2>What We Need and What You Get</h2><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$5000 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?</span><br/></p>
<p>First, an important declaration: PWR is free and we want to keep it free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.</p>
<p>However, PWR is now a 70-person organization putting on a show for 1000 people. One thundo! Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spent just north of $6660 (this number is real) to create WINTER WONDERSLAM.  </p>
<p>New for this campaign is <b>profit sharing</b>. After a show cycle, we'll reconcile our expenses (including investments in our savings accounts) and all revenues. 20% of the delta will be re-invested in PWR. The remaining 80% will be split evenly across all performers. This further horizontalizes our organization and means that your support on our Indiegogo not only keeps our league running, it can go directly to the folks you see in the ring.</p>
<p>Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Decorations and props</b>. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a GOURD-FILLED WINTERMAS WONDERLAND by their selfless capable hands. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Safe space/security</b>: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Ring repairs</b>. Have you seen our ring recently? It’s WILD WITH SPLENDOR! We have new robes, new pads, new turnbuckles, and thirteen extremely heavy steel beams which keep us safe and sound as we fall down and over and over again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a majority of them. Below is our complete budget.</p>

Hellsport is a great corporation!Also, look forward to the conclusions of important battle-stories involving Pasta Man, Luigi Primo, the Dumpster Babes, Dazza Longbarrel, Kippy, Chad Blitz, Chubby Uncle Juan, the Intergalactic Express, Noisebot, Hot Dog and more! ALL UNRESOLVED TITLES WILL BE CHALLENGED! NEW TITLES WILL BE INTRODUCED! PARTY VIOLENCE WILL REIGN!What We Need and What You Get$5000 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?
First, an important declaration: PWR is free and we want to keep it free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.
However, PWR is now a 70-person organization putting on a show for 1000 people. One thundo! Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spent just north of $6660 (this number is real) to create WINTER WONDERSLAM.  
New for this campaign is profit sharing. After a show cycle, we'll reconcile our expenses (including investments in our savings accounts) and all revenues. 20% of the delta will be re-invested in PWR. The remaining 80% will be split evenly across all performers. This further horizontalizes our organization and means that your support on our Indiegogo not only keeps our league running, it can go directly to the folks you see in the ring.
Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:

Decorations and props. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a GOURD-FILLED WINTERMAS WONDERLAND by their selfless capable hands. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.
Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.
Ring repairs. Have you seen our ring recently? It’s WILD WITH SPLENDOR! We have new robes, new pads, new turnbuckles, and thirteen extremely heavy steel beams which keep us safe and sound as we fall down and over and over again.

For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a majority of them. Below is our complete budget.

Extremely Hype Swag
Here we'll post photos of some of the stuff you can get by supporting us.
Here's the design for our donor t-shirt by PWR powerman Zeke Guadiana. The only way to lock down on this bad boy is through our Indiegogo—it's an insanely powerful badge of honor for making the WRESTLEVANIA dream real.The donor hoodie features this design on on the back with the PWR logo on the front.

As it continues to grow wantonly like an uncontrollable teen (and our expectations for our performance climb) we approach a new realm of costs we could not have imagined before.  We are depending on the support of our Multiverse to keep our show free and open—thank you for your continued support.  Rest assured we are working night and day to make sure this event is the most fun thing you do all quarter.Risks:The only risk is the risk of not partying hard enough.

<h2>Résumé du projet:</h2>
<p><strong>QUI SOMMES-NOUS?</strong></p>
<p>CréActifs est une compagnie de théâtre créée par Julien Blais en 2015 pour qui l’envie de fonder cette plateforme artistique a émergé du constat que l’aspect « production » est souvent absent des activités culturelles de loisirs. Notre approche part du principe que c’est à travers le regard d’un public que l’acte créateur prend véritablement son sens et devient ainsi un acquis réel pour le participant. Nous cherchons à mettre l’accent non pas sur une démarche simplement récréative plutôt que créative et proactive. En effet, le mandat de CréActifs est d’être ouvert à tout participant en quête de créativité et de leur donner les outils, la structure et le support nécessaires pour nourrir celle-ci, non seulement à travers l’acquisition de « compétences » artistiques, mais, aussi et surtout, en développant un sentiment d’accomplissement par l’aboutissement d’un projet complet. Cette année, Julien a passé le flambeau de la production à Anne-Marie St-Louis, une jeune metteure en scène émergente dans le domaine du théâtre d’intervention.</p>
<p>Les objectif d’Anne-Marie?</p>
<ul>
<li>De faire de l’art qui déconstruit les notions préconçues de représentation, de culture et d’identité</li>
<li>de concevoir la performance comme un acte de revendication et de résistance puissant, provocateur et poétique</li>
<li>de s’investir dans les communautés</li>
<li>d’utiliser des formes interdisciplinaires, communautaires et non-hierarchiques</li>
<li> d’engager et jouer avec le public, plutôt que simplement pour le divertissement du public. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>QUE FAIT-ON?</strong></p>
<p>En début mai 2017, CréActifs présentera le projet ÉCLOSE: une réécriture iconoclaste et post-moderne de 3 pièces qui traitent toutes de la représentation des femmes et de leur désir de se définir elles-mêmes. Projet intertextuel et interdisciplinaire par dessus tout, la production cherchera à mêler les genres d’expression (cinéma, danse et performance art) et à composer des scènes développées à partir de nos recherches dramaturgiques et improvisations, tout cela afin de raconter trois histoires de cloisonnement et d'éclose dans un labyrinthe des sens tout à fait unique. Nous occuperons le sous-sol de l'église St-Denis et l’idée sera  de se servir pleinement de ces lieux non conventionnels de représentation pour dire de nouvelles choses et développer de nouvelles dynamiques entre spectateurs et comédiens.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>Avec :</strong></u><br/>Robin Abdo, Léa Bégis, Éléonore Brieuc, Maëlle Campagnie, Alexis Curodeau-Codère, Chloé Désiré, Gwenn Duval, Yseult Gibert, Alice Hinchliffe, Samita Mandjee et Clara-Marie Nasser.​</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Ce dont nous avons besoin: </h2>
<p>Un tel projet encourt évidemment des dépenses considérables pour des étudiants à revenu modique. Nombreux parmi nous sommes des artistes qui contribuons plus de 10 heures par semaine à ce projet sans rémunération pour notre travail. C’est pour cette raison que nous sollicitons votre aide! Cette contribution de votre part ajouterait de la valeur à notre spectacle, ce qui attirerait un plus grand public et faciliterait la possibilité que le spectacle soit remonté. Votre contribution irait vers l'achat de matériaux pour les décors et costumes qui sont essentiels à la réalisation de notre vision. Enfin, votre contribution nous permettrait également d’acheter nourriture, boissons et décorations afin de créer l’événement communautaire qui précèderait le spectacle et qu'il nous est à cœur d’offrir aux citoyens de Montréal.</p>
<p>Cela dit, si nous ne parvenons pas à notre objectif visé de 1000$, les fonds seront mis vers la location de la salle car notre priorité est d'aboutir notre projet afin qu'artistes et spectateurs puissent se rencontrer, se questionner et formuler ensemble une vision d'un monde meilleur.</p>
<p>Pour vous remercier de votre implication et de votre générosité, nous sommes prêts à vous faire parvenir par courrier ou en personne quelques petites surprises originales! Cliquez dans l’onglet de droite pour en savoir plus.</p>

<h2>L'impact de votre contribution :</h2>
<p>En contribuant à cette campagne, vous soutenez une troupe d'étudiants montréalais qui cherchent à rêver et créer ensemble, vous soutenez du théâtre qui est non seulement nouveau mais novateur, qui veut promouvoir une égalité sociale diverse, qui veut reconnaître la puissance libératrice des individus qui choisissent de se définir eux-même. Vous soutenez des artistes qui travaillent fort, qui prennent conscience du monde dans lequel ils vivent et veulent éveiller cette conscience chez les autres.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Les risques et défis :</h2>
<p>Nous sommes une compagnie qui commençons sur la scène montréalaise mais qui cherche justement à être ouverte et prendre des risques: à essayer de nouvelles choses, à expérimenter de nouvelles formes... Le théâtre nous passionne et si nous n'avons pas les réponses à tout nous nous forçons à poser les bonnes questions. </p>
<p>Le principal défi de notre travail est de le faire volontairement. Comme nous ne sommes pas soutenus par un théâtre établi, nous devons, en plus de passer du temps dans les répétitions, trouver une salle de représentation adéquate, créer nos propres campagnes de publicité et de sensibilisation et trouver nos propres subventions. Ce n'est pas toujours facile d'équilibrer notre vision idéale avec la réalité concrète de notre situation financière !</p>
<h2>Comment nous aider autrement :</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Nous apprécions énormément votre intérêt pour notre troupe et notre projet! C'est entièrement grâce a vous, grâce à votre participation, à vos ""likes"" sur Facebook et à votre encouragement que nous arrivons à progresser et présenter une production finale sur la scène Montréalaise. </p>
<p>Si vous êtes incapables de faire un don financier mais cherchez d'autres manières de vous impliquer avec CréActifs, soyez rassurés que nous avons quelques options alternatives. </p>
<p>Vous pouvez par exemple:</p>

<li>partager notre lien indiegogo avec d'autres</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We, Kimberly and Michael, are film and stage actors local to Atlanta. We are self producing Nick Payne's ""Constellations"" at Indigo Yoga Studio in Kirkwood, greater Atlanta area. We would greatly appreciate any contributions to help make this non-linear show a unique theatrical experience for everyone involved. Producing live theatre can be an expensive process and we want to approach this theatre piece in a challenging way that has never been done before by combining the artistic visions of over 12 local Atlanta directors to depict multiple universes.  Any help you can offer would be reciprocated with all the perks listed that we are personally providing as a token of our gratitude. We hope this play will challenge minds, touch hearts, and at the very least get people talking about new ways to perform theatre in Atlanta. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a few basic things to make this show happen and then after that everything else will be icing on the cake.</li>
<li>
<strong>1)</strong> we need to pay for the rights in order to actually do the show.</li>
<li>
<strong>2)</strong> We need to pay for lights and pay for a set design that is aligned with each director's vision.</li>
<li>
<strong>3)</strong> We need enough money for posters and programs </li>
<li>
<strong>4)</strong> We need to pay for comfortable seating and risers</li>
<li>Our perks are personal lessons, and services using our unique gifts, and abilities. Kimberly, a certified yoga instructor is offering yoga lessons, guided meditations, energy healing, singing lessons and pottery lessons. Michael, a certified chess instructor, is offering lessons in chess and tennis. All of these perks are intended to empower, teach, heal, and enrich the lives of our donors. We are also offering fun options such scavenger hunts in Kirkwood and healthy kombucha beverages. </li>
<li>Anyone who buys a ticket will also get a discounted $5 yoga class at Indigo Yoga Studio.</li>
<li>We are very passionate about this play and committed to making it happen so if we don't reach our entire goal, we will prioritize expenses based on the list above as ordered and put on the best show we can with whatever money have.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope our show will impact the lives of audience members in a profound way that will stimulate conversations and new ideas. We hope our performance will inspire creative artists in Atlanta to produce more art that touches lives in a unique and positive way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The non-linear writing is a fabulous challenge. We are taking risks by working with over 12 collaborating directors to create one cohesive theme. Given that the show is a two hander, it is a personal challenge for us as actors to bring so many different perspectives to life within one play. The play delves into sensitive topics like brain cancer, Glioblastoma multiforme, assisted suicide and controversial theories like the ""Multiverse"" theory.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A humble donation of just 1$ would mean a lot to us. Every little bit counts. But if you can't afford to contribute monetarily, please use the Indiegogo share tools and share our campaign on social media</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are unamused theatre, an eclectic group of young theatre makers in Dublin who need a bit of help to make theatre. We are writers, directors, designers actors and producers. We are your friends and neighbours. </p>
<p>Our play is a response to the ever-growing rental crisis in Dublin, specifically its affect on the ''millennial'' generation. It's a fresh, absurd approach playing on the hilarity of the situation to highlight an often quite sinister reality for young people in Dublin. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>We need to raise 1000 euro beans to make sure our wonderful production goes off without a hitch.</p> <p>Once raised your money will help our wonderfully talented design team create a beautiful stage to look at, full of pretty lights, costumes, props and set designs to sell your granny for!</p>
<p>Rehearsing is going to be important too. Otherwise you'd just be showing up to a pretty stage full of people who don't speak or move. Boring right? Your funding will help us with much needed rehearsal space and keep our cast up to date with the words they should be speaking.</p>
<p>Great, now you know about our show and its funding and we trust you will tell all of your friends. ''But what about all those people who haven't seen this campaign? How are they going to know about your secret but extremely important play?'' I'm glad you asked! Finally we will use our remaining funding to go towards advertising and making sure that we create a network of wonderful audience members who will surely become your new friends after the show. You might even go for a drink with one of these new friends, get their number perhaps? Imagine we were to help you find your life long partner in crime? Essentially this is an investment in your future wedding. Think about it.  Funding us = finding love. Wow! That is such a bargain.</p>

<p> 21/40 Productions is back and rehearsals have begun for our  first full length production, Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead.</p>
<p>Our mission is to tell honest and accessible stories. We strive to give our audiences an intimate and unique experience every time they join us and we believe this script fits perfectly into that vision.</p>
<p>Dog Sees God is an “unauthorized parody” of the Peanuts. The kids are all grown up and hardly recognizable.  And of course, Charlie Brown - now CB - is at the center of it all.</p>
<p>The loss of a childhood friend forces our guy into an identity crisis .... Good Grief! … and nobody seems to care. His sister is too busy with drama club, his ex-girlfriend is in lock up, and his friends are too high to help. With nowhere else to turn, he pours his heart out to a piano player – one of the kids he normally bullies – and their friendship has the entire school on edge</p>
<p>This play has so many wonderful things for us to explore … bullying, loss, friendship, drug uses … and it’s all through the lense of these characters that we all thought we knew.</p>
<p>On top of a stellar story, we’ve assembled an incredible cast and booked a really neat and intimate venue for this show, but of course we still need to raise some funds to make this the best production possible. Anything raised will go towards costumes, props, renting set pieces, marketing and paying our actors for the time and effort they’ve dedicated to telling this story. If enough is raised, we would also use some of the funds raised to sponsor a few free performances, or  pay-what-you-can performances. We want to ensure that all members of our community, no matter their circumstances, have the opportunity to see our show.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dog Sees God opens February 23rd at Pinwheel Arts &amp; Movement Studio. For dates and ticket information, check out our website.  We’d love to see you there</p>

Anything raised will go towards costumes, props, renting set pieces, marketing and paying our actors for the time and effort they’ve dedicated to telling this story. If enough is raised, we would also use some of the funds raised to sponsor a few free performances, or  pay-what-you-can performances. We want to ensure that all members of our community, no matter their circumstances, have the opportunity to see our show.
 
Dog Sees God opens February 23rd at Pinwheel Arts & Movement Studio. For dates and ticket information, check out our website.  We’d love to see you there",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong>Who are you people?</strong></p>
<p>West Edge Opera is located in the San Francisco Bay Area. We produce operas for a new audience. We don't do stuffy opera. We re-imagine classics and create new works in order to appeal to non opera fans and expose them to this art form, making them life long opera lovers.</p>
<p><strong>So what's the project?</strong></p>
<p>So glad you asked. Benjamin Britten is turning 100 this year and we wanted to do something special to celebrate. His amazing, haunting opera - <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> is based on the Henry James short story. It’s a psycological thriller that puts the destruction of innocence front and center.</p>
<p><strong>What's the story?</strong></p>
<p>The production will focus on the world of a young governess who slowly goes mad as she tries to protect the children in her charge from evil ghosts. We will live project the images of two opera singers as they perform the music from off stage.</p>
<p><strong>Who's in the show?</strong></p>
<p>Top quality opera singers have been engaged for the production. The Governess is played by Laura Bohn who was first seen as Ariel in our premiere opera: <em>Caliban Dreams</em>. We next presented Laura in our ground breaking production of <em>The Mahagonny Songspiel</em>. You remember her - she was the clown with the tassels on her boobs!  Also in the production are Buffy Baggott, Jillian Khuner and Daniel Curran as the ghostly Peter Quint. </p>
<p><strong>Aren't there some kids?</strong></p>
<p>OMG! We almost forgot the kids! We have four amazing kids taking on two roles: Miles and Flora. Milo Boland and Emilia Meachum (The blonde cast) and Arman Marchiel and Larkin Barnard Bahn (The brunette cast)  Why have two casts? Well - you never know with kids... Colds happen and we want to be able to be flexible with them.</p>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>Ah, gee! I knew you would ask that. Many of you have been to our theater and have luxuriated in the comfortable seats, air conditioning and easy parking. You have been amazed that such a theater exists at a high school. What you probably haven’t realized is that up until our last production, the theater has been managed at a very low rate by the district headquarters in Richmond, but no longer - our rental fees have more than doubled mid-season. Surprise costs from our last production sprained our budget and we are still feeling the hurt. Your donation will get us in the door once again. We are having to make tough choices because of this and we don’t want to have to make the choice to leave our beautiful theater. Please help.</p>

<h3>Re-Build It, And You Will Come</h3>
<p>Malibu Playhouse is a 501(c)3 not for profit corporation and was founded in 1991 by theater icon Charles Marowitz and Jackie Bridgeman.  Over the years, the theater has produced many acclaimed productions as well as served as home for two children's theater groups.  Although the initial funding for the theater -- then called Malibu Stage Company -- helped convert a church into a beautiful functioning theater, the difficult economy has seriously impacted donations, and the theater has fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p>We're reaching out to friends, family and past patrons to help this local gem be repaired and restored so we can continue to entertain audiences, educate children and teens in theater arts and engage the Los Angeles community by providing a center for all performing arts.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>When the theater was constructed, a half-moon-shaped stage was built.  This stage offers unique unimpeded sight lines for the audience, but it was constructed with a sloping rake, which means it's 7 inches high at the front of the stage and 13 inches at the back wall.  (If you place a ball at the back wall, it will roll on its own to the audience's feet!)</p>
<p>The raked stage is impractical -- building sets to fit the weird angle is expensive and time-consuming -- and it's also very dangerous.  Several actors and dancers have sustained injuries during performances.</p>
<p>Also, when the theater was built, the lighting grid was installed too high, which means that the tops of actors' heads are lit but everything else remains in shadow.</p>
<p>Years ago, a large dressing room was added on, but without much-needed donations, it is in a sad state: moldy and frayed carpet, limited electricity, crumbling shelves, insufficient storage and no secure lock-up.</p>
<h3><strong>How Your Donation Will Be Spent</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild and level the stage</li>
<li>Lower the lighting grid by 6 feet</li>
<li>Build an enclosed lighting/sound booth</li>
<li>Repair and restore the dressing room</li>
<li>Replace the severely weathered signage</li>
<li>Repair and refresh the front lobby</li>
</ul><h3>What Impact Your Donation Will Have</h3>
<p>We want to create theater that gets you thinking and discussing, and maybe changes your perspective on the world. Theater has always been about community and sharing stories, ideas and feelings.</p>
<p>Your support will also help us continue to work with children's and teen programs that encourage, teach and promote creative expression.</p>
<p>In return, we'll give you a place where you can enjoy all the arts -- music, dance, vocal performances, stand-up -- and where you can bring friends and family with pride.</p>

I thought I had seen everything the stage had to offer on Judy Garland. I remember it was late, I didn't want to go. I even was afraid that I would fall asleep. Still, I went to see it - perhaps expecting something cliché - but Instead I enjoyed an original, sexy, and unexpectedly emotional theatrical experience. It was like hearing the songs for the first time. I realized how little I knew of Garland's songbook, aside from what we are mostly accustomed to hear. The show's uniqueness was puzzling. I was amazed by how sexy and lusty her songs were. Here is a 20 something years old guy singing ""The man that got away,"" pouring his own emotions into the notes. The contrast is difficult to explain. Imagine the 60's Rat Pack, or today's Warblers performing these songs and you're half way there.</p>
<p><br/>I met with the writer and director, Alejandro Ullua - one of the greatest contemporary directors in Argentina. We talked about how much Judy had meant for his father who had recently passed away. This tribute was a way to celebrate his father's memory. And that aspect, although not expressed literally in the piece - came through in its uniqueness. It was more than a concept. It was a love letter. I told Alejandro that I'd love to someday bring the piece to the US. We sucesfully finished a workshop presentation last week in New York City and we premiered the show Off-Broadway to venue owners, some press and friends.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Now...</strong> we got invited to the prestigious Dublin Gay Theatre Festival! This is an honor that would give our show good international exposure, as well as it will help us keep and build momentum for our return to the Big Apple in June.<br/> </p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>From now until about May 9th, we'll be rehearsing and professionally taping the show and this is where it gets interesting for you.

By contrasting the story of a successful writer with that of my mother, a classically trained singer who chose family life over her singing career, this engrossing play explores the challenges facing the woman and the artist in today's society, promotes education and strives to examine and challenge the misunderstandings still associated with women's rights, the role of the artist in society and the nature of the life of a troubled but gifted artist. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/659065070787043/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/events/659065070787043/</a></p>

Since then we have been working hard to bring <i>The Medium</i>, our first production, to Chicago audiences in October and November of this year. We want to get people talking about the issues we face in today's world and hope the power of music and theater can inspire those conversations at a community level. We also want to provide a professional and well-organized environment for emerging artists to work. There are only a handful of small opera companies in the Chicago area and sadly, some of them have recently shut down. We want to show the Chicago community that opera is relevant in today's world and we also want to showcase the amazing talent we have here!</p><p style=""""><b>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</b></p><p style=""""></p><p style="""">Many people don't realize that arts organizations make very little money on ticket sales. Most of the funding for arts organizations comes from a combination of individual giving, corporate giving, foundations, endowments, and government funded grants. As a brand new company, we certainly don't have any endowments at this point and it is very difficult to get grant money from foundations and government organizations. This is because, understandably, we do not have a body of work to make our case. Therefore, we have to rely on corporate and individual giving for a large part of our funding until we have a few productions under our belt. We hope you will believe in what we want to achieve and will contribute as generously as you can.</p><p style=""""><b>WHAT YOU WILL GET:</b></p><p style=""""></p><p style="""">Our perks are listed on the right hand side of the page.

Since then we have been working hard to bring The Medium, our first production, to Chicago audiences in October and November of this year. We want to get people talking about the issues we face in today's world and hope the power of music and theater can inspire those conversations at a community level. We also want to provide a professional and well-organized environment for emerging artists to work. There are only a handful of small opera companies in the Chicago area and sadly, some of them have recently shut down. We want to show the Chicago community that opera is relevant in today's world and we also want to showcase the amazing talent we have here!WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:Many people don't realize that arts organizations make very little money on ticket sales. Most of the funding for arts organizations comes from a combination of individual giving, corporate giving, foundations, endowments, and government funded grants. As a brand new company, we certainly don't have any endowments at this point and it is very difficult to get grant money from foundations and government organizations. This is because, understandably, we do not have a body of work to make our case. Therefore, we have to rely on corporate and individual giving for a large part of our funding until we have a few productions under our belt. We hope you will believe in what we want to achieve and will contribute as generously as you can.WHAT YOU WILL GET:Our perks are listed on the right hand side of the page. We think they are pretty cool! Everyone who donates to our campaign will be listed in our program and on our website as a supporter of Third Eye Theatre Ensemble. You'll also get our undying gratitude, which we hope counts for a lot, and a feeling that you are making a difference. Your contribution, however big or small, helps us tremendously! You're also helping to keep the performing arts alive. Who wouldn't feel good about that?WHERE THE MONEY GOES:
Artist Salaries (Singers, Actors, Directors, Designers)
Sets, Lighting, Props
Rehearsal Space Rental
Performance Space Rental
Keyboard Rental
Truck Rental (for transporting set pieces and lighting equipment)
The Rights to Perform The Medium

HOW DOES MY CONTRIBUTION HELP:Here are some examples of what your specific contribution can do for us:

$10 buys 1 hour of rehearsal space rental
$25 buys 1 hour of truck rental

<p>Anika started dancing
just before she turned 6. It was fun for her! She had a natural grace and ability,
and <b>she quickly developed a passion for dance that has continued to grow over
the years</b>. </p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Along the way, she began to dream that one day she would be a professional dancer. When she was 13, Anika
asked me (her mother), if she could go to New York City and study dance at the
Alvin Ailey summer dance intensive in New York. </b></p><p><i>(For the non-dancers: each summer, many professional dance companies offer
summer dance intensives, usually 2-6 week programs that offer the chance to
improve skills and train with new teachers. Participation in these highly
competitive, demanding summer intensives is essential if one hopes to join a professional
company one day.)</i></p>
<p>I took Anika to the Detroit Opera House, a stop on Alvin Ailey's national audition tour so she could audition. And, well, let’s just say that she
was not quite ready for the big leagues!  She returned the
following year, and again was not accepted. </p>
<p>Anika was not
discouraged! She continued to work hard, grow as a dancer and pursue her
dreams. She attended summer intensives at Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, and
Interlochen. <b>In 2012, Anika joined the <a href=""http://www.eisenhowerdancecenter.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eisenhower Dance Center</a>, and with
the opportunity to learn from, and even perform in programs with professional
dancers, her skills have improved dramatically in the past two years.</b> </p><p>Last year, Anika auditioned a third time for the Ailey Summer Intensive, this time for the Professional Division. Again, she was
not accepted. But she was able to attend the Complexions
Contemporary Ballet Intensive in Detroit, which was a wonderful experience for her. </p>
<p><b>A couple of weeks ago,
Anika auditioned with Ailey for a fourth time. This time, she was accepted! </b>She
is elated by this opportunity to train at one of the most outstanding dance
schools in the country.  Attending the Alvin Ailey Professional Division Summer Intensive would be an
important step towards Anika's dream of becoming a professional dancer. <b>But the
full cost of this 6 week program in New York City is more than our family can
afford. </b></p>

<p>Guiness Book of World Records will send out adjudicators and equipment in order to prove I can do it but this is done at my expense.  Being based out of London and the fact that they do this for a living, means that breaking a record is unfortunately not cheap.  So this has switched from a solo effort to a team effort. Want to be a part of it?  Here is how it works: On the top right is my current verses my goal.  Contribute any amount you want.  Below that you will see perks I will give for different amounts.  Once this is closed and I have the amount I need, I set up the record attempt with Guiness and away we go!  </p>
<p>In the gallery tab I have some videos of my training and I will be adding more as I keep training.  Feel free to take a look and see the progress I am making towards beating the record.  This video is where I stand at the start of this project.  It is about 1,144 taps per minute.</p>

<div>For those able to, they will get to take part in the upcoming video that I will make as a thank you to all my backers.  This either means working with me in person if you can or getting a video of you dancing to me and I will add it to the video.</div>

<br/>On top of that I will also give out another special surprise gift to all that got it right.  The special gift will be announced along with those that got it correct at the project's end!<br/><br/>

</div></div>","The Skinny My name is Colby Nielsen.  Better known by some as Mummbles.  I am an aspiring professional dancer with an affinity for tap.  I have recently been training to break some tap speed world records.  The first one being ""Most Taps in a Minute"" set at 1,163 by Anthony Morigerato.  I have the speed and am very close to the conditioning to do it but I still can't break it alone.  
Guiness Book of World Records will send out adjudicators and equipment in order to prove I can do it but this is done at my expense.  Being based out of London and the fact that they do this for a living, means that breaking a record is unfortunately not cheap.  So this has switched from a solo effort to a team effort. Want to be a part of it?  Here is how it works: On the top right is my current verses my goal.  Contribute any amount you want.  Below that you will see perks I will give for different amounts.  Once this is closed and I have the amount I need, I set up the record attempt with Guiness and away we go!  
In the gallery tab I have some videos of my training and I will be adding more as I keep training.  Feel free to take a look and see the progress I am making towards beating the record.  This video is where I stand at the start of this project.  It is about 1,144 taps per minute.

Can't contribute?  That isn't a problem. You can still play a part by sharing on social media. Please use the sharing tools just below the pitch video at the top of this page.  If you have contributed or plan on contributing still use the social media sharing tools. The more people that see it the better chance we have of breaking a record!  So please Share, Share, Share.   The Game 
You may have noticed that there were some changes between scenes in the video.  The name of the game is to name all of those changes. Watch the video and see what has changed in it.  Then be sure your have contributed $50 because that perk is what allows you to guess and get the extra reward.  Then send me your guess in a message, not in the comments.  When the project's funding phase has come to an end I will show everyone the list of things that changed and put a list of who was correct up.  Those that guessed correctly get a special reward.

For those able to, they will get to take part in the upcoming video that I will make as a thank you to all my backers.  This either means working with me in person if you can or getting a video of you dancing to me and I will add it to the video.

On top of that I will also give out another special surprise gift to all that got it right.  The special gift will be announced along with those that got it correct at the project's end!

We hope it will be the beginning of a new way of experiencing and taking part in theatre. We'd like to start having our own season, start building a community of contributors and patrons, and start discussions about the boundaries that currently exist in this art form and how to bend or break them. It's ambitious, yes, but we think it's an important step towards the survival and revitalization of American theatre.</p><p>Last year we live-streamed the whole process. This year we're taking a more refined approach. We feel by editing the content, we'll make it more accessible and easier to digest. Ultimately we hope to meet somewhere in the middle, providing a way to have interaction and instant-feedback during the rehearsal process as well as providing edited videos for those who need to play catch up! We hope to showcase how actors and the director interact in a rehearsal. We also hope to show what goes into designing a show. You can see the struggles along the way, the sacrifices that must be made, and the small victories that add up to the final product. Then you can come see the show live and see how it all turns out. You can congratulate your favorite actor on coming so far since the first day. Or you could do it all in reverse - come see the show and then take a look back at the rehearsals and meetings that made the show what it has become.</p><p>It's new. It's scary. It's naked.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people can't even afford to donate $10 and, believe us, we understand.

We've already been accepted to D.C.'s Capital Fringe Festival this July, and the only thing left to do is to raise the funds! This play is a reinterpretation of the Antigone story, best known from Sophocles’ play called, you guessed it, Antigone. Julia Sears will be directing the show, and we'll be following the challenges and rewards of working directly with a new playwright to produce a new show!The MoneyNaked Theatre Company was founded by three starving actors, and so we're looking for your support to help us get theatre out to new audiences while enriching the experience for long-time theatre-goers! We've divided our budget out so that you can see exactly where the money is going. Budget:

Actors (7) $700

Director $100
Film Person $100
Stage Manager $100
Lighting Designer $100
Sound Designer $100
Costume Designer $100
Playwright: $100
Advertising (postcards/posters) $100
Set $100
Props $100
Costumes $150
Lighting/Sound $85
Script copies/paper $150
Rehearsal Space $800
Indiegogo Fees $115
GOAL: $3000
If we reach this goal, it allows us to produce our show without going into debt! The DreamOur first show, R.U.R., was called ""an impressive debut"" by The Washington Paper and we'd like to keep that momentum going for our second show. We hope it will be the beginning of a new way of experiencing and taking part in theatre. We'd like to start having our own season, start building a community of contributors and patrons, and start discussions about the boundaries that currently exist in this art form and how to bend or break them. It's ambitious, yes, but we think it's an important step towards the survival and revitalization of American theatre.Last year we live-streamed the whole process. This year we're taking a more refined approach. We feel by editing the content, we'll make it more accessible and easier to digest. Ultimately we hope to meet somewhere in the middle, providing a way to have interaction and instant-feedback during the rehearsal process as well as providing edited videos for those who need to play catch up! We hope to showcase how actors and the director interact in a rehearsal. We also hope to show what goes into designing a show. You can see the struggles along the way, the sacrifices that must be made, and the small victories that add up to the final product. Then you can come see the show live and see how it all turns out. You can congratulate your favorite actor on coming so far since the first day. Or you could do it all in reverse - come see the show and then take a look back at the rehearsals and meetings that made the show what it has become.It's new. It's scary. It's naked.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people can't even afford to donate $10 and, believe us, we understand. If you'd like to help in some way, though, anything is appreciated. Here are ways you could help:
We're looking for spaces where we can rehearse in June. Have a space or a lead on a space?
Do you have a website or business where we could advertise for free?

</ul><p></p><h3>What Is Tieline Theater?</h3><p></p><p>In the Quinnipiac Theater department, there's a tradition that's been upheld since its inception. After performing in their first mainstage show all newcomers receive a piece of tie line, presented to them by the veterans of the department.  This tie line is a symbol of inviting them wholeheartedly into the theater family called the ""D-Lites"" or ""Drama Lites"" (but we'll save the origin of that D-Lite-ful name for another time).</p><p>The piece of tie line has come to represent many things since the tradition started, and though its origins are somewhat blurred, the strongest image is one of unity and bonds. Much like how tie line holds together a theater set; students and alumni of the department are all held together and connected by their experience and the powerful work they've done, no matter where they are.</p><p>We have incorporated this idea of being connected into the very core of our performace. ""It's like you and your scene partner are attached by a million tiny strings, so everything each of you does directly influences the other."" (Timothy Cochran: Professor of Communication and Theater, Holyoke Community College) We want to connect with each other, with other student and performers, with the audience and with the community as a whole. </p><p>And so, our goal is to raise awareness of the theater department's potential, not only on the Quinnipiac Campus but in the surrounding community. We aim to build a stronger alumni/undergraduate relationship as well as a continuing relationship with the faculty further reinforcing those bonds and forging new ones. It will give students a chance to put into practice what they have learned in the classroom, as well as letting alumni and students learn from each other in a creative environment.</p><p>This project is being used as the cornerstone for future endeavors; including full-length summer shows and workshops. We wish to bring theater to the community and enhance the local arts culture, while at the same time promoting the talents and the assets that Quinnipiac can provide to the surrounding community.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>In order to successfully put on this show, we need money for:</p><ul>
<li>Housing and food for tech week and performances</li>
<li>Posters, flyers, and other miscellaneous publicity</li>
<li>Transportation (gas and train fare)</li>
<li>Costumes and props</li>
<li>Stipend for cast and crew</li>
</ul><p>As a result, we'll be able to provide:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>A touching but fun and exciting romp through the woods!</li>
<li>
<b>FREE</b> Admission!</li>
<li>Some very fun and unique rewards including things like a personalized sonnet, a specially filmed version of the show, a workshop with the actors, and even a lovely reception hosted by the whole Tieline crew!</li>
<li>The groundwork to make this kind of project a recurring yearly event.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The goal of Quinnipiac's theater department has always been ""Theater for Community."" But that community is both internal and external. By supporting us, you'll not only be strengthening the student/alumni theater community, but also extending the Quinnipiac/Hamden theater community beyond the confines of the school year. We chose to adapt A Midsummer Night's Dream because we feel the conflict and story of the Lovers, as crazy as it can get, is something that will really connect with people on many levels, and connection is the ultimate purpose of our project. We genuinely feel that this project will leave a lasting impression with everyone involved and will not only challenge and bring the cast together, but strengthen the ties between the community and the art that can flourish within it. If theater hadn't been such an important part of our lives, we wouldn't be doing this. If we didn't think that doing great theater that engages the community was important and could enrich people's lives, we wouldn't be doing this. We want to give back to a school and community that's given us so much, but we need your help! And with it, we know we'll give people a unique and very entertaining experience while laying the groundwork for even greater things to come.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3><p>If you support our effort and can't contribute monetarily, never fear! Just spreading the word is an INCREDIBLE help. Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers… anyone! Even a little can go a long way, and we deeply appreciate any form of assistance you can provide.</p><h3>Meet the Cast &amp; Crew!</h3><p><b>Drew Scott (Director)</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/589905/files/20140519111315-Drew_Pic_small.jpg?1400523195"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Drew Scott is a member of Actors’ Equity Association and has performed and directed with companies on both the East and West Coast such as Hartford Stage Company, The Odyssey Theatre, Long Wharf Theatre, The McCarter Theatre, and Yale Repertory Theatre.
