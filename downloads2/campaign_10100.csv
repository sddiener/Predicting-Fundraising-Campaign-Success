</p><h2>What is gSOUND?</h2>
<p>
</p><p>gSOUND is an hardware component that is
embed between the existing components, between your car audio system
and speakers. This is an audio analog&amp;digital balancer gadget
that was designed in Agromehatronika LLC! So, we decided to start
Indiegogo's Campaign for introduce gSOUND to wider audience,
audiophiles and all others who loves good sound. 
</p>
<p>We offer gSOUND to you at below-retail
pricing while we get ready to start shipping it around May 2015. The
gSOUND is developed and will be introduced to the world via
Crowd-Funding. We feel that this is the absolute best way to show the
world its capabilities in an exciting and interactive way. One that
allows the crowd to join forces with us to bring about real change in
the car audio system sound.  While at the same time, allowing
individuals over the world to engage, suggest and share their ideas
to make the gSOUND experience a truly special.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>
</p><p>Working principle is simple, but the
hardware component and technology are TOP SECRET. 
</p>
<p>If your car have a built-in standard
car audio system with a minimum of four speakers (two front and two
rear) yust install gSOUND between the existing car audio suistema and
speakers, and will give you a unique feeling of sound (gSOUND are the
hardware component that is coupled between the existing components,
or between your audio system and speakers. If you have more than four
speakers it will be even better!). 
</p>

<p>The gSOUND system!</p><br/></div>","You are able to buy great sound speaker and car audio (Hi-Fi) system. Untill now it was impossible to buy something like gSOUND system. gSOUND is something completely new and special. Because of a new approach we have developed extraordinary audio analog&digital balancer gadget and  we have find an easy way to embed into your existing car audio system. We have fully functional samples of the gSOUND system (several prototypes) that will soon be ready for production. We are a small company and only have the capacity to finance modest production runs. Placing an order of multiple thousands of units is beyond our grasp. This is where you come in. You can help us to increase the amount of product we can order from the factory as well as accelerate the speed with which we can get it into the homes of our customers. Your support will make this possible! Thank you for your support!For more information please contact us!If you have embed
gSOUND, the following happens: a sound propagation follows - reacts
in relation to the movement of the car. If the car turns left, sound
is transferred to the front right speaker, if the car is accelerating
at the same time the sound passes from the front right into rear
right speaker. You literally feel the music; you can almost touch the
sound; music goes smoothly with the car motion. If you are breaking,
car sound goes to the front speakers; if you accelerating, sound goes to rear speakers; if you are turning right, sound goes from
back to front left speaker; if you are turning left, sound goes from
back to front right speaker; simply incredible. New way to listen and
feel your favorite music. A unique feeling. New experience.
What is gSOUND?

gSOUND is an hardware component that is
embed between the existing components, between your car audio system
and speakers. This is an audio analog&digital balancer gadget
that was designed in Agromehatronika LLC! So, we decided to start
Indiegogo's Campaign for introduce gSOUND to wider audience,
audiophiles and all others who loves good sound. 

We offer gSOUND to you at below-retail
pricing while we get ready to start shipping it around May 2015. The
gSOUND is developed and will be introduced to the world via
Crowd-Funding. We feel that this is the absolute best way to show the
world its capabilities in an exciting and interactive way. One that
allows the crowd to join forces with us to bring about real change in
the car audio system sound.  While at the same time, allowing
individuals over the world to engage, suggest and share their ideas
to make the gSOUND experience a truly special.


How it works?

Working principle is simple, but the
hardware component and technology are TOP SECRET. 

If your car have a built-in standard
car audio system with a minimum of four speakers (two front and two
rear) yust install gSOUND between the existing car audio suistema and
speakers, and will give you a unique feeling of sound (gSOUND are the
hardware component that is coupled between the existing components,
or between your audio system and speakers. If you have more than four
speakers it will be even better!). 

You  will receive an unspeakable gSOUND
experience at below-retail pricing.
It sounds frickin 'awesome! 

That's all you must to know!

What does it sound like?

How do we say this politely? It sounds
frickin' awesome! But you don't have to take our word for it. We took
gSOUND to Car Audio & Tuning Shows in the region and asked
audiophiles to take a listen and tell us what they thought. Guys
mostly have extolled the idea and a different approach and comments
was extraordinary, outstanding, remarkable, ...
Feelings are remarkable; you literally
feel music; you almost can touch the sound; music goes smoothly with
car motion. If you are breaking, car sounds goes to front speakers;
if you are accelerating, sounds goes to rear speakers; if you are
turning right, sounds goes from back speakers to front left speaker; 
 if you  are turning left, sounds goes from back speakers to front
right speaker. 


Installation   gSOUND

Installation is simple because the
gSOUND has embedded standard car audio connectors. gSOUND is hardware
component that is embed between the existing components, or between
your audio system and speakers. gSOUND is mounted with standard ISO
Connector and you will receive also instruction for direct wire
connecting. It is very simple to connect.
Just plug and play!

<p>Hello.  We are ConnectionOpen.  A small group of family and friends out to make a difference by offering a new and better way to connect and create over long distances.  Many of us have been in the entertainment and teaching business for decades. We have developed many important (and famous) contacts within the industry and hope to use them, your money and our double patented application to make this new way of connecting possible.  With this new tool in the arsenal of teachers, musicians, voice actors, broadcasters…..we can cut the lag time between destinations to fractions of a second, making it seem like you were in the same room with the other person!  On top of this, we send these transmissions uncompressed (unlike mp3), so the sound is natural and vibrant! We can also synchronize others to join in these sessions.  This can allow recording sessions, broadcast transmissions, demonstrators and presenters an opportunity to communicate and react instantly with the other participants, despite their points of origin.  </p>
<p>Currently we have the audio version completed and are looking for up to $1M in financing to program the remaining bits of code so we can add video at the same speed and vibrancy.  Besides being used for programming, the money we raise will also be used to hire other creative professionals to develop and customize ConnectionOpen for its wide range of potential products and markets. This will also include marketing to further craft and refine our positioning and sales professionals to help us identify emerging markets and strategies for this new way of communicating.  While there are products out there that do what we do…..none can compare to the quality, ease-of-use, extremely low latency and the strength of the 2 patents behind our process.  These valuable patents are like protection for your investment…..we own this type of transmission.</p>
<p>We have paved the way for synchronous connectivity with our work on the audio portion already…..now we just want to widen the roads a bit to allow for video.  By investing and having ownership in the ConnectionOpen project you will help open doors previously closed to others due to distance and resources.  Imagine the difference this will make between school districts that have little to no resources by hooking them up to those that are blessed with more.  Small businesses could present like pros, musicians and voice actors can perform in unison…..collaborating and creating new art forms and ways of sharing ideas even though each participant is in a different location.</p>
<p>The interest we have generated already is growing quickly.  We have presented to major OEM firms, studios and talent with our FREE beta version at <a href=""http://www.connectionopen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.connectionopen.com</a>.  We invite you to try it for yourself as proof we’re on to something.  If you can’t invest……please spread the word about our amazing new technology so no one goes unheard.</p>

Crafting Hi-Fi Sound For 45 YearsWe’re Morel, and, for the last 45 years, we’ve been creating high-end, high fidelity sound systems and speakers for people around the world. We love high-quality sound and music and only seek to make speakers that we ourselves enjoy, love, and want.With Hogtalare, we did what we do best - create amazing high-quality speakers. But this time, we added the technology and refined the process to make it innovative and affordable, while keeping the sound, quality, and craftsmanship absolutely perfect.We’re proud of what we’ve made and hope you’ll love it too.A Legacy of Quality CraftsmanshipWhat Makes A True Hi-Fi SystemThe overall sound quality of a hi-fi system is determined by literally hundreds of aspects, from the quality of your power supply to the synergy between driver materials.The tech used to transmit your audio from your source is just one link in the chain (which is also affected by a lot of variables), and its effect on the result is only limited by how well it’s implemented in the R&D process. This is exactly where Hogtalare shines!From a sonic perspective, Hogtalare was developed like an old school hi-fi speaker, and only then did we add power and connectivity, making sure that everything was tailor-made to our spec and needs.The result is an entire Hi-Fi system enclosed in a single box, designed with perfect harmony between all parts to ensure incredible sound. This is what Morel does best.To get Hogtalare to sound just right, we had to mix modern technology with old-school acoustic design doctrine. We integrated our high-end audio craftsmanship with our award-winning tech to give you the perfect sound at the perfect price.Expert FundamentalsHand craftsmanship and attention to detail are at the heart of the Morel production process. To produce loudspeakers that deliver that magical feeling, the human touch is an absolute necessity.Each Hogtalare speaker is carefully assembled and extensively tested to ensure that it meets the highest standards. Morel’s four decades of experience and knowledge permeates in every detail of Hogtalare’s engineering and design.This meticulous engineering process created an amazing self-contained HiFi system on par with some of the highest quality speakers ever.Custom ElectronicsGood sound doesn't need a lot of power, it needs the right kind of power. That’s why we designed Hogtalare’s electronics from scratch, with dedicated built-in amplifiers, for the woofer and each of the tweeters, and a custom-built DSP unit to sync everything together.We used only the best acoustic technology and customized Hogtalare’s electronics to work in perfect sync with the full system. Our dedicated veteran, award-winning acoustic engineers made sure every piece of technology worked in tandem with the hardware.Each piece was selected for sound quality first, instead of the glitz in getting the “latest” tech. This is why we chose Bluetooth 4.2 instead of Bluetooth 5 - it simply sounds better.Seamless, Powerful DesignWe designed Hogtalare as a simple, clean square - a shape that is perfect from a sonic perspective while staying modern and beautiful.It also fits perfectly into an IKEA’s Kallax/Expedit shelf unit, the most sold piece of furniture in history - with over 130 million units sold.Detailed for Optimal PowerWe didn’t just design Hogtalare to be beautiful - we made sure every piece of hardware was perfectly placed and engineered for optimal output. We carefully selected the materials for each component and positioned them exactly where they needed to be to create the clearest, most powerful sound possible.Each one of the drivers (woofer and tweeters) are specifically arranged to achieve their maximum resolution in relation to the cabinet and to one another.The cabinet is made from a thick wood compound with internal bracing and reinforcement to provide phenomenal sonic performance and insulation.To improve resolution with the grill on, we added waveguides (horns) to the frame, right above the tweeters. An EVA ring was also added to further improve resolution.Backlit Magnetic GrillThe grill has a full fabric design. No holes, no cutouts, only beautiful simplicity. The grills come in a variety of subtle and vibrant colors to perfectly fit your home decor.In order to maintain functionality without compromising the clean aesthetic, we made backlit buttons that you can see and operate through the fabric.Wireless Stereo PairingFor those who want a 2 speaker stereo system, Hogtalare supports TWS (True Wireless Stereo) pairing. That means you can wirelessly pair two Hogtalare units. Each unit will only play one channel (left or right), and you will get a dual speaker stereo system with unrivaled performance in this price range. Bluetooth & Auxiliary InputHogtalare supports both BT (Bluetooth) and AUX (auxiliary) inputs.Wirelessly stream music from your phone, connect your TV or laptop, or hook up your turntable to spin some vinyl.Advanced Bluetooth 4.2 technology and aptX support give you the most optimal sound for range capacity.Even our BT chip was specifically selected for its superior sonic characteristics, and APT-X support drastically improves the compression process in comparison to regular BT to give you higher fidelity.Even in connectivity, we keep audio quality top of mind.WiFi ReadyFor those who need a WiFi speaker, Hogtalare has a WiFi enabled USB power port on the back, so just plug your Chromecast audio or equivalent.From Supercars, Yachts, and Home Theaters…Now To You.Throughout the years, Morel has developed an enviable reputation for technological innovation and design excellence.Morel drivers, including tweeters, midrange, and woofers, are used in some of the most demanding, high-end products around the globe.

They called back with great reviews, comparing Oomo to their $10,000 professional earphones. Nello mentioned other than their professional grade earphones, Oomo 3D, were the most immersive surround sound earphones he has experienced. ""The sound quality was great. Rich, warm, smooth.

Miro was created because we want consumers to enjoy themselves in smart entertainment without compromising on sound/video quality. It aims to bring the authentic happiness back to us by giving it freedom to go. So we made it elegant, powerful, colorful and possible anywhere. This is Miro, one product, in your hands, on the go.</p><p>The market today is flooded with uneven quality of products, Bluetooth speaker, WiFi speaker, TV box, projector, tablet. People in search of the optimal media experience were busy with multi devices, and often got tethered to a very specific room if they want connected enjoyment of stereo sound. In many cases, the result is either sacrificing time and money on different gadgets, or stuck indoors for fair movie audio immersion. We miss the importance of entertainment: freedom.

This is Miro, one product, in your hands, on the go.The market today is flooded with uneven quality of products, Bluetooth speaker, WiFi speaker, TV box, projector, tablet.

<p>Hi everybody! Thanks for taking the time to check out my IndieGogo campaign! :) </p>
<p>I'm a bicoastal musician, actress, model, and Editor-in-Chief of MITH Magazine living mainly between NYC and LA. I'm so excited to share my first pop single <strong>Like A Drum </strong>with you! I need your help to raise funds to release this song, film the official music video in London in two weeks, and to complete my EP of 5 songs total! The footage you see here is just a teaser. The final and official music video for this song will be completely magical. I am shooting it with an award-winning director! </p>
<p>I wrote the song <strong>Like A Drum </strong>to celebrate overcoming obstacles and rising above like a bird escaped from a cage and not letting anything hold you down. I hope my song<strong> </strong>and my EP in development will share a strong message of hope to a darkened world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486341985/dlhmyrxqaisyaibapao0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My journey in entertainment and fashion began when I quit my day jobs in North Carolina as a Spanish teacher and interpreter in my early twenties and said goodbye to my hometown to pursue a career in New York City, first starting out with acting and modeling. After three years in NYC, I headed to LA for a year and worked bicoastally while recording my first pop single <strong>Like A Drum</strong>, and also co-founding MITH Magazine, a fashion and entertainment magazine spotlighting young up-and-coming stars.</p>
<p>I am so passionate about MITH Magazine, which is why I've included it in with the perks! MITH has a similar motive to my music...to tell the stories of the dreamers and the go-getters who accomplish the seemingly impossible by maintaining that resilient overcomer spirit despite all odds. MITH also sheds a very tasteful and elegant look on fashion and entertainment that is family-friendly, yet still edgy and modern. I try to incorporate these values in my magazine and all my creative work, including my music projects.</p>
<p>Through the funds raised in this campaign you will help to make this project a success, and I believe you will also help to spread strong messages of hope and resilience to uplift spirits for such a time as this. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO ARE DROP LEGS?</h3>
<p>We are a 6 piece Roots Hip Hop band from Byron Bay Australia and we've been playing and touring for about 2 and a half years. During this time we have released an EP, two follow up singles which were premiered on Australia's prestigious Triple J Radio Station, and have toured the East Coast of Australia 5 times and Indonesia once.</p>
<p>As a band we have a lot of great new unreleased music and our dream is to release it as an album (digitally, on CD and Vinyl) to current and new fans in Australia and overseas. We believe an important step towards this goal to utilise publicists and distribution networks to achieve our desired reach. This in turn will help us play bigger and better gigs and provide a solid platform to launch future releases. We all work regular jobs as well as rehearse, tour and record however now we need to ask for some extra help to reach this next step in our musical careers.  </p>
<p> We have already recorded over half of the album,and we are extremely proud of how it is sounding - however we still need at least $10000 to add to our own contributions to invest in printing, promoting, publicising and distributing the next single (released early March) followed by rest of the album in the middle of the year. If we don't achieve this financial goal we will invest the money in the March single followed by an EP (extended play of around 6 tracks).</p>
<p>We live in an expensive world and greatly appreciate any contribution you make, and if you can't contribute - no worries, come along to one of our shows and we'll put you on the door...</p>
<p>Anyone who can contribute however, we will personally send you the following as a thank you offering when the album is released...</p>
<p>$10  = Sticker and shout out to you online</p>
<p>$25 + = Digital download of album + sticker sent out</p>
<p>$40  + = Signed CD sent to you + sticker</p>
<p>$60 + = Signed CD  + Drop Legs T - shirt + sticker </p>
<p>$100 + = Signed CD + Drop Legs T- shirt  + sticker + name in the credits of album </p>
<p>$500 + =  Signed Vinyl or CD + Drop Legs T - shirt + sticker + name in the credits + invitation to private launch party</p>
<p>$1000 + = All of the above + a personal song about you or your loved one</p>
<p>$1500 or more = All of the above + negotiable suggestions  </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY?</h3>
<p>If you are a music lover than this project will  surely interest you. So far on the album our unreleased tracks feature producers such as Paul Pilsenkis (Angus &amp; Julia Stone, Mars Volta, Metallica, Dope Lemon, The Skatalites, Living End) and Andrew Mckinnon (Desmond Cheese). We have been recording out of Pete Murray's studio in Byron Bay as well as a mobile studio set up on a house overlooking Byron Bay town. <br/>Our music features drums, guitar, bass, saxophone, trumpet, keys, percussion, singing and rapping and its great for dancing, chilling out or cruising around town in your car. We have formulated our own Roots Hip Hop sounds which oozes of coastal vibe mixed with an urban street undertone. Here are some quotes from our website....</p>
<p><strong><i>""Drop Legs are (or are damn sure about to be) everyone's favourite coastal chill/hip hop/reggae sensation. They're smooth, clever and funky, and you need them in your playlist.""</i> </strong>(Erica Mallett, FBi Radio, Coda Conduct)<br/><strong><i>""Loving the blend of reggae and hip hop you've got going on.""</i></strong> Sarah Howells (Roots n All Triple J)</p>
<p>Please listen to our music on Spotify, or soundcloud ( <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/droplegs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/droplegs</a> ) or most other online listening platforms.</p>
<p>After packing out all our recent shows in Sydney, Gold Coast and Byron Bay and having our latest singles premiered on Triple J, we feel ready to launch into the next step of the journey.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk of this campaign is that we fall short of the required funding needed to launch the album. The way we will ensure to overcome this risk is to adjust our promotion and publicists budget accordingly, the lesser budget we have the less tracks and lower reach we will aim for. Ultimately we are going for quality over quantity - we would rather release fewer solid tracks and push it thoroughly to the right audience. </p>

WHY?
If you are a music lover than this project will  surely interest you. So far on the album our unreleased tracks feature producers such as Paul Pilsenkis (Angus & Julia Stone, Mars Volta, Metallica, Dope Lemon, The Skatalites, Living End) and Andrew Mckinnon (Desmond Cheese). We have been recording out of Pete Murray's studio in Byron Bay as well as a mobile studio set up on a house overlooking Byron Bay town. Our music features drums, guitar, bass, saxophone, trumpet, keys, percussion, singing and rapping and its great for dancing, chilling out or cruising around town in your car. We have formulated our own Roots Hip Hop sounds which oozes of coastal vibe mixed with an urban street undertone. Here are some quotes from our website....
""Drop Legs are (or are damn sure about to be) everyone's favourite coastal chill/hip hop/reggae sensation. They're smooth, clever and funky, and you need them in your playlist."" (Erica Mallett, FBi Radio, Coda Conduct)""Loving the blend of reggae and hip hop you've got going on."" Sarah Howells (Roots n All Triple J)
Please listen to our music on Spotify, or soundcloud ( https://soundcloud.com/droplegs ) or most other online listening platforms.
After packing out all our recent shows in Sydney, Gold Coast and Byron Bay and having our latest singles premiered on Triple J, we feel ready to launch into the next step of the journey.

Risks & Challenges
The main risk of this campaign is that we fall short of the required funding needed to launch the album. The way we will ensure to overcome this risk is to adjust our promotion and publicists budget accordingly, the lesser budget we have the less tracks and lower reach we will aim for. Ultimately we are going for quality over quantity - we would rather release fewer solid tracks and push it thoroughly to the right audience.

Use with multiple playing areas to add pitch-bend between notes and chords by changing how you squeeze the button.  MAPPABLE MODULATIONConnect to your favourite DAW or plugin on iPad or Mac and use Skwitch side by side with any standard keyboard controller.  Add modulation, pitch-bend and channel pressure to your performances, or use as a multi-channel mappable controller for total flexibility.   MUSICAL SCRATCHPAD  Use the Skwitch Music app like a musical scratchpad. Just add and drag notes around till you create something you like then roll with it. It's great for sparking and capturing ideas when you are out and about, and it's a quick and brilliantly easy way to lay down bass lines or expressive melodies in your DAW.    Includes: Skwitch, Skwitch Music app, Getting started guide App Compatibility: iOS 12.0 and newerDevice Compatibility: iPhone 6S and newerAdditional software for iOS Switch Control users:  Skwitch Access appAdditional lessons for Swift Playground coders: Skwitch, Droids and Drones Skwitch is ready to ship, our app is ready to go, but we need your help with the finishing touches. By supporting Skoogmusic's hardworking team of engineers, coders, industrial designers, and musicians, you'll be playing an essential role in helping us fulfil our mission of enabling everyone to play and make music.    Our mission is to give everyone the chance to make music, especially those who find traditional instruments difficult or impossible to play.  Over the last 10 years we've been privileged to share in some fantastic musical awakenings with individuals for whom playing a musical instrument had never seemed like an option. It's been an honour to follow these new musicians as they grow in confidence and stretch the boundaries of what is considered possible. Without the brilliant and inspirational work of various music therapists, educators, charities and inclusive music practitioners: dedicated to bringing the joy of making music to everyone, none of this would be possible.  During this campaign we are offering you the chance to donate a Skwitch to one of our musical inclusion heroes. When you select our 'Buy 1 Give 1' perk, we'll ship one Skwitch to you and another to one of our inclusive music partners. We'll let you choose from our selection of inclusive music partners to receive your donation - or if you have someone specific you'd like to donate to, just let us know.At the end of the campaign you can keep an eye on our blog to see what these little musical squishies are getting up to out in the wild.   What could possibly go wrong? Hardware products are difficult to get off the ground; they're real, not virtual, so they need to be manufactured, which means significant sums have to be spent upfront on tooling and volume production, and a lot can go wrong along the way.  The good news is that our first production run is complete, and the product is fully tested, boxed and ready to ship.   Our first app is up and ready for iOS on the App Store - it works great, and we're looking forward to refining it with your help.  During the Skwitch:lab takeover we'll be playing to the strengths of our experienced development team, who've been developing award-winning apps and products since 2009.  Of course, unforeseen issues do arise during app development; sometimes a task will throw up complications that couldn't have been foreseen; updates or bugs in the operating system can sidetrack development; and occasionally the app review process takes longer than anticipated.  Fortunately we have the expertise in-house to work through any issue that arises. If anything does go dramatically wrong, we'll let you know immediately, but rest assured that the only cost will be time  - you won't miss out on any promised features or updates.",37.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>The Jamberry Piquencer is an attempt to stop my Gear Acquisition Syndrome.</p>
<p>For a long time I was looking for a groove-box and purchased a bunch of them.

<p>I pondered about using the Raspberry Pi for music making for a while and when me and my wife moved from London back to Germany I decided to take three to four months off to devote myself to  writing the software and assembling the hardware needed for a standalone portable sequencer.</p>
<p>The Piquencer is my take on what I believe is a good work-flow and set of functionality tailored to my own needs as a user. I assume that it will work equally well for others.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The research and development is taking longer than expected, I am now in month seven.

Here’s an overview of both modes.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Looper Mode</strong></h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.datalooperpedal.com/indie/looper-mode.gif"" src=""""/></h3><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Looper mode is designed to emulate a 3-track, traditional loop pedal. The software automatically detects tracks containing “DL#” in the track title and synchronizes the status LED’s with the looper, so you can loop without looking at a screen. The master control buttons on the right most column allow you to stop, mute or clear all three loops at once. </span></p><p>Datalooper also features a 'new session' mode. If you hold the clear button for one second, the metronome will turn off and the tempo will re-calculate based on the next loop you record. This allows you to fluidly move between pieces without having to listen to a click track. Best of all, Datalooper never stops the transport to change tempo, meaning you can linearly record your whole set and capture every loop and overdub in pristine quality.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Session Control Mode</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.datalooperpedal.com/indie/session-control.gif"" src="""" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'/></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Session Control mode eliminates the need to MIDI map clip slots and gives you a hands-free workflow for rapidly creating clips on the fly. The software automatically detects tracks containing “CL#” in the track title and auto-scans for unused clip slots. The controls (record, stop, undo, clear) are then attached to that clip slot. When you are done with a clip, you can hold ""stop"" and advance to a new clip; allowing you to record a lot of ideas very quickly. Session control mode also allows you to work directly with MIDI Overdubs, meaning you can overdub onto MIDI clips without worrying about the session record button triggering every record armed track. </span></p><h3> </h3><h3>Specs</h3><p>DataLooper was designed to be large enough for comfortable button operation, but lightweight and small enough to fit on a pedalboard. It weighs less than 3 pounds and has the following dimensions:</p><p><strong>Size L x W x H:</strong></p><p>8.74 in x 5.75 in x 2.01 in<br/>(222 mm x 146 mm x 51 mm)</p><p> </p><h3>Easy to Set Up</h3><h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>It's super easy to get started using the DataLooper. Simply install the included remote script and select DataLooper as a MIDI device in the Ableton preferences. Connect the micro-usb cable, open up your Ableton project and you're good to go!</span></h3><h3><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUPXgknIlKM""></iframe></div></h3><h3> </h3><h3>A Deeper Technical Overview</h3><h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>If you want to fully understand all of the features of the DataLooper I would recommend watching this detailed overview to learn exactly how to set up and utilize the DataLooper to revolutionize your live or studio sessions.</span></h3><h3><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnQCXynhLlQ""></iframe></div></h3><h3> </h3><h3>Highly Configurable</h3><h3>

A custom Ableton Live Remote Script controls communication and synchronization between the DataLooper pedal and Ableton, making the DAW &amp; pedal work seamlessly together.</p><h3>Fulfillment Timeline</h3><p>If the DataLooper is successfully funded, here's what the months following the Indiegogo campaign will look like.</p><p><strong>November 20 - January 1: Final Prototype and Bench Testing</strong></p><p>This period of time will allow for any final design changes based on community feedback and allow a final prototype to be created and fully tested.</p><p><strong>January 2 - End of February : Manufacture &amp; Software Tweaking</strong></p><p>The first two months of 2019 will be dedicated to manufacturing the DataLoopers; assembling PCB's, coordinating with the machine shop to ensure perfect enclosures, etc. In tandem with the physical product development, the software aspect of the DataLooper will be fully tested and perfected.</p><p><strong>Early March : Shipping and Website</strong></p><p>At this point, DataLoopers should be ready to go and will be sent out to backers. To maintain communication with backers and other potential customers, a website with support, software downloads, etc. will be established for the DataLooper.</p><h3><strong>Why Support this Project? </strong></h3><p>Your financial support will enable me to offer the DataLooper at a more accessible price point and get it into the hands of musicians immediately. Although a small batch (10) of the pedals has already been created, the manufacturing costs associated with small runs makes it cost prohibitive to offer these pedals at a reasonable price. Successful funding of the Indiegogo campaign will enable me to pay the manufacturing fees for a higher number of pedals to be created at once, lowering the cost per unit to a reasonable price point. It will also aid in covering additional costs, such as FCC Certification and Provisional Patent application fees required in bringing a product to market. By supporting this project, you are also supporting the development of an open-source looper system. All of the DataLooper software will be released under the GNU General Public License; this means that anyone can use and modify the software to customize it for their needs.</p></div>","DataLooper is complete and now shipping!Please visit http://www.datalooperpedal.com for more info and to purchase!The Only Foot Controller Built For Ableton Live LoopingSay goodbye to generic MIDI controllers that you have to spend days programming.

The software automatically detects tracks containing “DL#” in the track title and synchronizes the status LED’s with the looper, so you can loop without looking at a screen. The master control buttons on the right most column allow you to stop, mute or clear all three loops at once. Datalooper also features a 'new session' mode. If you hold the clear button for one second, the metronome will turn off and the tempo will re-calculate based on the next loop you record. This allows you to fluidly move between pieces without having to listen to a click track. Best of all, Datalooper never stops the transport to change tempo, meaning you can linearly record your whole set and capture every loop and overdub in pristine quality. Session Control ModeSession Control mode eliminates the need to MIDI map clip slots and gives you a hands-free workflow for rapidly creating clips on the fly. The software automatically detects tracks containing “CL#” in the track title and auto-scans for unused clip slots. The controls (record, stop, undo, clear) are then attached to that clip slot. When you are done with a clip, you can hold ""stop"" and advance to a new clip; allowing you to record a lot of ideas very quickly. Session control mode also allows you to work directly with MIDI Overdubs, meaning you can overdub onto MIDI clips without worrying about the session record button triggering every record armed track.  SpecsDataLooper was designed to be large enough for comfortable button operation, but lightweight and small enough to fit on a pedalboard. It weighs less than 3 pounds and has the following dimensions:Size L x W x H:8.74 in x 5.75 in x 2.01 in(222 mm x 146 mm x 51 mm) Easy to Set UpIt's super easy to get started using the DataLooper. Simply install the included remote script and select DataLooper as a MIDI device in the Ableton preferences. Connect the micro-usb cable, open up your Ableton project and you're good to go! A Deeper Technical OverviewIf you want to fully understand all of the features of the DataLooper I would recommend watching this detailed overview to learn exactly how to set up and utilize the DataLooper to revolutionize your live or studio sessions. Highly Configurable
Everybody has different requirements and needs for a foot controller. After using numerous MIDI keyboards, mixers and foot controllers, I realized that most of the programmers making the config software were simply out of touch with musicians. The DataLooper Config Software will allow you to decide exactly what data you'd like each button to send. The drag & drop interface allows you to drag in multiple types of MIDI messages or if you prefer, Ableton API functions! If you want to have the bottom right button turn the metronome on or off for instance, simply drag the Ableton metronome control function to the button and it will work without having to map each project.
 Development & TechnologyDataLooper was born in 2016 after trying to integrate loop pedals into a band environment and getting frustrated with the hassle of synchronization. The software has been tweaked and the pedals have been road tested and refined over a number of iterations.DataLooper works by using the MIDI communication protocol with an ARM Cortex-M0+ based micro-controller. A custom Ableton Live Remote Script controls communication and synchronization between the DataLooper pedal and Ableton, making the DAW & pedal work seamlessly together.Fulfillment TimelineIf the DataLooper is successfully funded, here's what the months following the Indiegogo campaign will look like.November 20 - January 1: Final Prototype and Bench TestingThis period of time will allow for any final design changes based on community feedback and allow a final prototype to be created and fully tested.January 2 - End of February : Manufacture & Software TweakingThe first two months of 2019 will be dedicated to manufacturing the DataLoopers; assembling PCB's, coordinating with the machine shop to ensure perfect enclosures, etc. In tandem with the physical product development, the software aspect of the DataLooper will be fully tested and perfected.Early March : Shipping and WebsiteAt this point, DataLoopers should be ready to go and will be sent out to backers. To maintain communication with backers and other potential customers, a website with support, software downloads, etc. will be established for the DataLooper.Why Support this Project? Your financial support will enable me to offer the DataLooper at a more accessible price point and get it into the hands of musicians immediately. Although a small batch (10) of the pedals has already been created, the manufacturing costs associated with small runs makes it cost prohibitive to offer these pedals at a reasonable price. Successful funding of the Indiegogo campaign will enable me to pay the manufacturing fees for a higher number of pedals to be created at once, lowering the cost per unit to a reasonable price point. It will also aid in covering additional costs, such as FCC Certification and Provisional Patent application fees required in bringing a product to market. By supporting this project, you are also supporting the development of an open-source looper system. All of the DataLooper software will be released under the GNU General Public License; this means that anyone can use and modify the software to customize it for their needs.",9.0,3,"1 Campaign

This means that if your headphone has a single detachable cable that plugs into either the left or the right speaker chambers, it will work. It also works with headphones and earphones that have dual detachable cables that feed into both the left and right speaker chambers at the same time. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">AirMode has incorporated aptX and AAC high-performance stereo codecs. AptX is suitable for Android and other devices, whereas AAC is suitable for IOS devices (Apple). AAC and aptX audio technology delivers CD / Hi-Fi sound quality (16-bit/44.1kHz) over Bluetooth connections.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">AptX is featured in over 320 leading audio brands from headphones, speakers, smartphones, gaming consoles and home entertainment products. We have used the latest aptX - CSR8645 chip due to its upgraded features and its headphone stereo separation capabilities. Stereo separation means that the AirMode Bluetooth cables can help to recreate audio recordings in its most natural state, by delivering clear and accurate sound similar to a 3D audio experience.</p>

You may be interested in a new piece of hardware called AirMode that converts wired headphones to wireless"" The Future Is Wireless  The Design Concept The AirMode Bluetooth cable concept originated from today's Bluetooth earphones where a cable feeds around the back of your neck. This ergonomic design is used by major earphone audio brands but none have offered this as a detachable, wireless cable for headphones as yet. Bluetooth earphones have a battery inside the earphone housings and the Bluetooth transmitter is placed inside the cables main controller. We have redesigned this concept and have managed to place all components inside the main controller which enables us to provide an all-in-one wireless solution for your detachable wired headphones and earphones. Please note, that this photo is not of AirMode. This is just used as a demonstration of the concept idea behind the AirMode Bluetooth cables.   How Does AirMode Work? The AirMode Bluetooth cable is available in three different versions and is designed to work with detachable, dual port headphones and earphones. This means that if your headphone has a single detachable cable that plugs into either the left or the right speaker chambers, it will work. It also works with headphones and earphones that have dual detachable cables that feed into both the left and right speaker chambers at the same time.  


 
 
AirMode Usability
 
The AirMode Bluetooth cables are small, lightweight, water and sweat resistant. Combined with our HD noise blocking microphones and voice recognition feature, they are ideal for the office, factory, gym, running, gaming, watching movies, mixing or commuting.
 

 
Hi-Fidelity Sound
 
AirMode has incorporated aptX and AAC high-performance stereo codecs. AptX is suitable for Android and other devices, whereas AAC is suitable for IOS devices (Apple). AAC and aptX audio technology delivers CD / Hi-Fi sound quality (16-bit/44.1kHz) over Bluetooth connections.
AptX is featured in over 320 leading audio brands from headphones, speakers, smartphones, gaming consoles and home entertainment products. We have used the latest aptX - CSR8645 chip due to its upgraded features and its headphone stereo separation capabilities. Stereo separation means that the AirMode Bluetooth cables can help to recreate audio recordings in its most natural state, by delivering clear and accurate sound similar to a 3D audio experience.

<h3>A home for Schwebung Mastering</h3>
<p>My name is Stephan Mathieu, some of you will be familiar with my work in the field of electroacoustic music. Since the early 1990s <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/53728-Stephan-Mathieu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;' target=""_blank"">I have released 60 albums</a> either solo or in collaboration with likeminded people, among them Taylor Deupree, Fennesz, Robert Hampson (as MAIN), Kassel Jaeger, France Jobin, Akira Rabelais and many others. You can read more about my background and approach to sound and mastering <a href=""http://www.schwebung-mastering.com/approaching-sound/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p>I want to shift my focus from creating towards mastering music for other artists, a work I deeply love and that in the longer run will allow me and my family more financial stability. </p>
<p><strong>To archieve this goal I want to start building my own mastering studio in September 2018.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Mastering</strong> is the last creative step before music gets released on vinyl, CD, cassette, or as files for digital distribution and streaming. During the mastering process, a production will see the final adjustments needed to ensure it will sound great on a wide range of speakers and headphones. Depending on the quality of the delivered mix, interventions necessary to archive this goal can either be subtle or rather drastic. 99% of professional or semi-professional productions made today will benefit greatly from careful mastering, a release that wants to stand out sonically can't do without this crucial finish.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>While sometimes referred to as a black art</strong>, in reality mastering is nothing but a process based on a strong set of <u>technical skills</u>, knowledge, a <u>deep dedication</u> to sound, and carefully selected equipment set up in a perfectly <u>tuned listening environment</u>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Excellent mastering can't be archieved without any of these.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><u>Skills</u> can be appropriated through years of hands-on experience and research, <u>dedication</u> has to be within you, cutting-edge <u>equipment</u> and a great sounding room for <u>critical listening</u> requires a substantial budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The current state of my project</span></h3>
<p>During a test phase, launched in 2015 I have worked on 200+ masters for some <a href=""http://www.schwebung-mastering.com/clients"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;' target=""_blank"">outstanding artists and labels from around the world</a>. While many of them come from a similar musical area to my own, I have also worked with musicians and labels covering the whole range – from jazz, pop, indie, metal, house, contemporary and minimal music, to a series of Mozart Piano Concertos and Bartok String Quartets.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The piece by <u>Jefre Cantu-Ledesma</u> in the video above is a fine example of what I believe in when it comes to good mastering: music will sound fantastic when it is treated carefully, no matter whether it’s a bells-and-whistles pro-studio production, a deliberately lo-fi wash of noise recorded at home, or anything in between. Jefre’s album <a href=""https://shiningskullstudio.bandcamp.com/album/a-year-with-13-moons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'A Year with 13 Moons'</a> – which made many best-of-year lists in 2015 – is a “true” high-resolution master with a full dynamic range and a frequency spectrum extending 35 kHz. It delivers its essence through earbuds playing on Vimeo, just as it will make your jaw drop when played on the very best set of loudspeakers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Most of my mastering work so far</strong> was done as a guest in professional studios run by friends, which offered me a very good working environment and great tools. However, this was not entirely effective simply because I had to collect some bookings first, find a free studio time slot, and then travel either 80 or even 250 kilometers to get there. Regardless of this, while focusing on mastering regularly it became clear to me that this is what I wanted to do for a living, and that I need my own studio to do this on a professional level. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>In 2017</strong> I prepared a fully-fledged business plan which was thoroughly checked and approved by the county's office for economic development, I also found a bank that was convinced by my endeavour and willing to apply for a state-funded low-interest founding loan in my name. Since I never had a fixed income from my work as an independent artist and teacher, I will now have to present a minimum of <strong>10% in equity </strong>–<strong> € 12,500 Euro</strong> – in order to have this loan approved.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><h3>What do I need the funds for?</h3><p>For my studio I want to <u>build a room with highly linear acoustics</u> and acquire a rather minimal, yet high-end <a href=""http://www.schwebung-mastering.com/studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">selection of mastering-grade digital and analog equipment</a> that will allow me to execute my work on the highest professional level. My choice of tools is based on 25 years of hands-on experience in professional studios around the world, I know what I need in order to work effectively for many years to come and, just as important: what I don't need.</p><p>The total investment I want to make in order to get my studio up and running is <u>€ 125,000 Euro</u>. A financial buffer to cover all running costs during the construction stage and seed phase is included with this budget.</p><p> </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>With this campaign I'm looking to collect € 18,000 Euro:</strong></p><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>€ 12,500 Euro</strong> – the equivalent of 10% of my studio loan</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>€ 4,000 Euro</strong> to cover the remaining manufacturing costs for the items offered here</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>€ 1,500 Euro</strong> to cover the campaign fees and extras</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>If you want to support my project you can choose from a range of perks, most of them being exclusive to this campaign.</p><h3> </h3><h3>A note regarding the flexible funding goal</h3><p>While I'm certainly planning to reach my funding goal of € 18,000 Euro, I've decided to keep it flexible, which means that I will receive the final amount collected, no matter whether or not the goal is met. However, the initial feedback received from subscribers to my mailing list has been quite overwhelming.</p><p>I will get <strong>the new CD releases</strong> offered here to the manufacturers <u>as long as I've collected a minimum of € 5,000 Euro</u> to cover costs. The items will be ready to ship around September 24th.</p><p>The <strong>mastering offers</strong> described below will of course be honored either way. </p><p>If the campaign turns out to be a success, I may add a stretch goal for another special item. The more equity I can build up for my studio, the easier I can start this new chapter in my life!</p><p> </p><h3>So, what will you get?</h3><p> </p><h3>In return, music</h3><p><strong>For the listeners among you</strong>, I’d like to offer a selection of three releases from my <a href=""http://www.schwebung.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Schwebung</a> label, two of them exclusive to this campaign.</p><p><strong>As a musician, band or label</strong>, you can book a session to have your next release mastered by me at a very special rate</p><p>or <strong>have one of your tracks remixed by Rafael Anton Irisarri</strong> of <u>The Sight Below</u> and <u>Black Knoll Studio</u>.</p><p>Please see below for further information on these alternatives. </p><h3>

<p><strong>Am I talking to the musicians/producers/gearheads now? Let's go.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you will find plenty of information on what I offer, what I need from you, my approach and the studio I want to build at <a href=""http://www.schwebung-mastering.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">schwebung-mastering.com</a>. In case you have a question or request, <a href=""mailto:mastering@schwebung.com?subject=Mastering%20inquiry%20%2F%20Indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">write me an email</a> anytime.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Plug-ins</strong> became really good in the last couple of years and I'm using a handful of fine tools I would never want to be without. Some of my colleagues are doing a fantastic job working exclusively <u>in-the-box</u>, all of them in acoustically tuned studios with a great set of monitors. However, for me it's the mix of excellent digital tools and the magic of analog transformers and valves that keep me excited. A digital piano or drum kit can sound really great but it will never come close to the character and detail the real thing has, not even the very best of them.  I'm currently working by travelling with my own DAC to two different all-analog studios equipped with some fabulous vintage gear. As mentioned earlier, this was always meant as a testing phase for various reasons.</p>
<p><strong>My own mastering chain</strong> will have one of the best mastering DACs available, my long-time dream set of monitors, and an all-analog chain custom-built for me by legendary equipment maker <a href=""http://www.knifaudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jonte Knif</a>. Even though there is a wide range of new and vintage analog mastering gear available, it made sense for me to take this ""custom everything from one source"" approach, just as you would find in the classic studios from the 1950s and 60s. That being said, I'm not interested in a vintage sounding studio, quite the opposite – I care very much about the advantages of cutting-edge digital technology. Each project has to have its own sound signature, the one that will enhance your vision perfectly. In the end, mastering has to be all about the result, not the tools or the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What’s on offer during this campaign?</h3>
<p>Basically, <strong>a complete mastering package for all the formats</strong> you'll need to get your music released at a very special price:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Vinyl / CD / Cassette / Download / Streaming – any combination of these</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mastered for iTunes – I'm certified by Apple</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A DDP.2.0 image if your release will go on a CD</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">I'm working with some of the best cutting engineers and manufacturers around in case you will need help with this</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In case you're interested in one of the variations, let me know when you want to book a date. Until the end of October I will continue to work in external studios, from November on we can also work in an attended session in my new studio in Bonn, Germany. Booking dates are first come/first served.</p>

</div></div>","A home for Schwebung Mastering
My name is Stephan Mathieu, some of you will be familiar with my work in the field of electroacoustic music. Since the early 1990s I have released 60 albums either solo or in collaboration with likeminded people, among them Taylor Deupree, Fennesz, Robert Hampson (as MAIN), Kassel Jaeger, France Jobin, Akira Rabelais and many others. You can read more about my background and approach to sound and mastering here. 
I want to shift my focus from creating towards mastering music for other artists, a work I deeply love and that in the longer run will allow me and my family more financial stability. 
To archieve this goal I want to start building my own mastering studio in September 2018.
 
Mastering is the last creative step before music gets released on vinyl, CD, cassette, or as files for digital distribution and streaming. During the mastering process, a production will see the final adjustments needed to ensure it will sound great on a wide range of speakers and headphones. Depending on the quality of the delivered mix, interventions necessary to archive this goal can either be subtle or rather drastic. 99% of professional or semi-professional productions made today will benefit greatly from careful mastering, a release that wants to stand out sonically can't do without this crucial finish.
While sometimes referred to as a black art, in reality mastering is nothing but a process based on a strong set of technical skills, knowledge, a deep dedication to sound, and carefully selected equipment set up in a perfectly tuned listening environment.
Excellent mastering can't be archieved without any of these.
Skills can be appropriated through years of hands-on experience and research, dedication has to be within you, cutting-edge equipment and a great sounding room for critical listening requires a substantial budget.
 
The current state of my project
During a test phase, launched in 2015 I have worked on 200+ masters for some outstanding artists and labels from around the world. While many of them come from a similar musical area to my own, I have also worked with musicians and labels covering the whole range – from jazz, pop, indie, metal, house, contemporary and minimal music, to a series of Mozart Piano Concertos and Bartok String Quartets.
 
The piece by Jefre Cantu-Ledesma in the video above is a fine example of what I believe in when it comes to good mastering: music will sound fantastic when it is treated carefully, no matter whether it’s a bells-and-whistles pro-studio production, a deliberately lo-fi wash of noise recorded at home, or anything in between. Jefre’s album 'A Year with 13 Moons' – which made many best-of-year lists in 2015 – is a “true” high-resolution master with a full dynamic range and a frequency spectrum extending 35 kHz. It delivers its essence through earbuds playing on Vimeo, just as it will make your jaw drop when played on the very best set of loudspeakers.
 
Most of my mastering work so far was done as a guest in professional studios run by friends, which offered me a very good working environment and great tools. However, this was not entirely effective simply because I had to collect some bookings first, find a free studio time slot, and then travel either 80 or even 250 kilometers to get there. Regardless of this, while focusing on mastering regularly it became clear to me that this is what I wanted to do for a living, and that I need my own studio to do this on a professional level. 
 
In 2017 I prepared a fully-fledged business plan which was thoroughly checked and approved by the county's office for economic development, I also found a bank that was convinced by my endeavour and willing to apply for a state-funded low-interest founding loan in my name. Since I never had a fixed income from my work as an independent artist and teacher, I will now have to present a minimum of 10% in equity – € 12,500 Euro – in order to have this loan approved.
 
What do I need the funds for?For my studio I want to build a room with highly linear acoustics and acquire a rather minimal, yet high-end selection of mastering-grade digital and analog equipment that will allow me to execute my work on the highest professional level. My choice of tools is based on 25 years of hands-on experience in professional studios around the world, I know what I need in order to work effectively for many years to come and, just as important: what I don't need.The total investment I want to make in order to get my studio up and running is € 125,000 Euro. A financial buffer to cover all running costs during the construction stage and seed phase is included with this budget. With this campaign I'm looking to collect € 18,000 Euro:

€ 12,500 Euro – the equivalent of 10% of my studio loan

€ 4,000 Euro to cover the remaining manufacturing costs for the items offered here

€ 1,500 Euro to cover the campaign fees and extras
 If you want to support my project you can choose from a range of perks, most of them being exclusive to this campaign. A note regarding the flexible funding goalWhile I'm certainly planning to reach my funding goal of € 18,000 Euro, I've decided to keep it flexible, which means that I will receive the final amount collected, no matter whether or not the goal is met. However, the initial feedback received from subscribers to my mailing list has been quite overwhelming.I will get the new CD releases offered here to the manufacturers as long as I've collected a minimum of € 5,000 Euro to cover costs. The items will be ready to ship around September 24th.The mastering offers described below will of course be honored either way. If the campaign turns out to be a success, I may add a stretch goal for another special item. The more equity I can build up for my studio, the easier I can start this new chapter in my life! So, what will you get? In return, musicFor the listeners among you, I’d like to offer a selection of three releases from my Schwebung label, two of them exclusive to this campaign.As a musician, band or label, you can book a session to have your next release mastered by me at a very special rateor have one of your tracks remixed by Rafael Anton Irisarri of The Sight Below and Black Knoll Studio.Please see below for further information on these alternatives. 
 1 – CD ReleasesPlease note that there are some variations for bundled items which  include the actual shipping costs, some of them at a discounted price. The new releases are currently in production and will be manufactured once the campaign has finished on August 28th. They will be ready to be shipped to you within 4 to 5 weeks. ↳ A special 2CD compilation
 
SCALE is a new 2CD collection of 11 pieces given to me by some friends and colleagues in support of my project:

Apart from François’ track, which I was allowed to pick from one of his digital releases, all of them are unpublished material, most of them made especially for this occasion.
The tracks were compiled and mastered by me and it's safe to say that I'm extremely proud of this one.

Scientists have long promised that one day Graphene will find its way into many facets of our lives including displays, electronic circuits and sensors. ORA’s Graphene technology makes it one of the first companies to have created a commercially viable application for this Nobel-prize winning material, a major scientific achievement.The GQ Headphones come equipped with ORA’s patented GrapheneQ™ membranes, providing unparalleled fidelity. The headphones also offer all the features you would expect from a high-end audio product: wired/wireless operation, a gesture control track-pad, a digital MEMS microphone, breathable lambskin leather and an ear-shaped design optimized for sound quality and isolated comfort.AUDIO PRECISION VIA NANOTECHNOLOGYGraphene pushes the limitations of loudspeakers, a technology that has seen little innovation since its invention in 1921. ORA takes a material that is 200 times stronger than steel and 1000 times lighter than paper and uses it to make flawless sound. This material provides significant benefits for loudspeaker performance:
Instant improvements in sound quality
Immediate extension of battery life, up to 70%
More volume from small speakers
Unrivaled high frequency response for improved localization cues
SOUND STAGEGrapheneQ technology enables better imaging.Typical, closed, headphones (left) produce “in-head” imaging where the entire sound-stage appears to come only from the small space between your ears. GrapheneQ (right) provides better localization cues producing a wider, more realistic listening experience.AUDIO PRECISIONGrapheneQ’s low mass prevents it from blurring sound with resonances and phase shiftsGrapheneQ reacts more accurately than other materials which allows it to truthfully recreate the original recording without additional artifacts.  WHAT IS GRAPHENE?Graphene is a new material, first isolated only 13 years ago. Formed from a single layer of carbon atoms, Graphene is a hexagonal crystal lattice in a perfect honeycomb structure. This fundamental geometry makes Graphene ridiculously strong and lightweight. It has been dubbed “the wonder material” because of its potential to change the world as we know it: from desalinating water, to curing spinal injuries, to making our computers 10,000x faster.MATERIALS SCIENCE FOR THE BEST AUDIOGraphene is considered the ‘holy grail’ for loudspeaker membranes, the part of the speaker that vibrates to produce sound. Because of its lightweight properties it can move quickly & easily and because of its incredible stiffness, it keeps its shape as it moves.    From award-winning professionals to everyday music lovers...  We let world-famous conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar, experience Graphene Audio and he was thrilled by the headphones' quality and accuracy of the sound.A MESSAGE FROM GUSTAVO DUDAMELAs a conductor, it is my job to listen. Recently, I was approached by ORA Sound, a nanotechnology startup claiming to have achieved groundbreaking levels of sound quality thanks to a new ‘wonder material’ called graphene.I was immediately blown away by the level of detailed, crystal clear sound from their speakers. From Brahms to Latin American folk songs, I heard every musical detail with a level of clarity I’ve only ever experienced from the podium in front of an orchestra.I am a fan of ORA and believe their technology can allow everyone to hear their favorite music like they are the conductor!Good luck ORA.- Gustavo DudamelThe day Gustavo Dudamel experienced Graphene Audio for the first timeDUDAMEL FOUNDATION PARTNERSHIPORA is thrilled to announce a partnership with Gustavo Dudamel and his charity, The Dudamel Foundation. Together we will provide children of diverse backgrounds with access to quality listening experiences. The partnership is inspired by the belief that the art of listening is fundamental to peace, harmony and understanding in our world. LOUDSPEAKER HISTORYMany of the recent advancements in loudspeakers and headphones have focused on the addition of digital processing (DSP). While DSP is a powerful tool, it can only act as a Band-Aid to mask the inherent performance issues of this century-old technology. ORA, instead, applies its expertise in nanotechnology and materials science to fundamentally improve the core of the loudspeaker and provide a level of quality and efficiency not possible from other consumer technologies.UNCOMPROMISING SOUNDORA’s patented GrapheneQ material is acoustically optimized to produce the smoothest, most extended frequency response for a true-to-life listening experience that will make you forget you are listening to loudspeakers.
Eliminates distortion for the most accurate audio
Detailed highs, crystal clear mids, and robust bass
Increased audio clarity through nano-scale audio precision
Lifelike, high resolution listening experience
IT’S ALL ABOUT EFFICIENCYSpeakers are probably the least efficient technology that we still use in our day to day lives. Less than 1% of the electrical power that goes into a speaker is converted into sound power. Graphene’s lightweight and low density properties means that it requires a lot less energy to move the membrane and produce sound.ORA’s GrapheneQ enables far more energy-efficient loudspeakers. A TECHNICAL INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHENEGraphene is a new material, first isolated only 13 years ago. Formed from a single layer of carbon atoms, Graphene is a hexagonal crystal lattice in a perfect honeycomb structure. This fundamental geometry makes Graphene ridiculously strong and lightweight. In its pure form, Graphene is a single atomic layer of carbon. It can be very expensive and difficult to produce in sizes any bigger than small flakes. These challenges have prevented pristine Graphene from being integrated into consumer technologies.THE GRAPHENEQ™ SOLUTIONAt ORA, we’ve spent the last few years creating GrapheneQ, our own, proprietary Graphene-based nanocomposite formulation. We’ve specifically designed and optimized it for use in acoustic transducers. GrapheneQ is a composite material which is over 95% Graphene by weight. It is formed by depositing flakes of Graphene into thousands of layers that are bonded together with proprietary cross-linking agents. Rather than trying to form one, continuous layer of Graphene, GrapheneQ stacks flakes of Graphene together into a laminate material that preserves the benefits of Graphene while allowing the material to be formed into loudspeaker cones.Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Comparison  Laser scans were made with a Klippel test system at a 3rd party lab, Warkwyn, a subsidiary of the USA loudspeaker manufacturer MISCO. WARKWYN 2D LASER SCANS Membrane motion in 2D cross-sections As loudspeaker cones move back and forth, transverse waves can also move through the membrane. Stiffer materials hold their shape better and prevent these transverse waves from coloring the sound.WARKWYN 3D LASER SCANS 3D membrane laser scansThe polymer membrane is exhibiting speaker “Break-Up” where one part of the cone is moving forward (Blue) while another part of the cone is moving backward (Red). This causes distortion and cancellations at certain frequencies producing an irregular frequency response. OPTIMIZED FOR SOUND ISOLATION AND ACOUSTICSThe closed back design and wooden ear cups provide excellent isolation from outside noise while offering optimized acoustic performance. These headphones are so comfortable, you’ll want to wear them all day long. The sealed, over-ear design is ergonomically shaped.INNOVATIVE GESTURE CONTROLSEven the slightest touch puts you in full control of ORA GQ Headphones. Use the unique touch interface on the aluminum disk to answer calls, change tunes, or adjust the volume. One Tap to Play/Pause; Double Tap to Answer a Call Slide to Skip Tunes Volume Up/DownMATERIAL ELEGANCEThe lambskin leather we use for the headband and ear pads is extremely durable and offers a soft, breathable touch for long-term comfort.

The most powerful and creative all-in-one effects unit
lts sophisticated retro-futuristic soul and its powerful processor is a completely revolutionary point of view on the classic effects like Echo Space, Delay, Filters and Reverbs, implementing the sounds results with other innovative unique effects such as DOUBLE PULSE DELAY , with superlative sound quality

IDEA
Like many of music electronic addicts, we spent a good part of our life in our studio, surrounded by machines, synths, drum machines, controllers, effects and various softwares. You can own them or desire them all but you will always need to looking for that particular thing that will give harmony and character to your setup.
In our case, we searched in vain for a hardware multi-effect with immediate access to all the parameters, beautiful, comfortable and intuitive, to be used in live performance but able to stimulate extremely creative results even in the studio.
Having found nothing on the market that matched what we were looking for, we decided to develop it as I have been an electronics designer for over 10 years.
During the months of development, new functions born and many of them are not reproducible with any configuration or other tools on the market already.
The encounter with key persons of music electronic world, their love at first sight with RemindeЯ projected us into the idea of ​​making it available to all those who, like us, want to explore innovative rhythmic and harmonic results.  
Enjoy team finally exhibited the prototype at the SUPERBOOTH in Berlin
The amazement in the eyes of those who tried it was the demonstration that RemindeЯ is a unique product that should be available all over the world.

SMART DESIGN
Behind Remider's smart and elegant design, it hides the essence of the meticulous study on the position of each individual knob and on the relationship between the functions assigned to them. The contact with Reminder will be remarkably surprising, and, since the first touch, you will see the simplicity of access to the desired function even when your gaze is turned to your synth in the studio, to the rest of your live set up  or to the dance floor. The design is so incredibly intuitive that you easily reach what you need at any time and place making the perfomers bring out all their creativity.
We at Enjoy Electronics come from the same world, we are Djs, Live performers, sound designers and it is exactly for this reason that we have succeeded in creating a device that is unique in its kind, intuitive and stimulating.

<p>The Gigaboom is our Staff Picked favorite speaker. It's  comes in two color ways, raw or gunmetal. Staff picked because:</p>
<p><strong>1) THE BUILD IS BEEFY</strong> - it's constructed with a double-shot injected FULL TPU from body to core. Most speakers use over or single shot molding processes that aren't nearly as strong/thick. This process allows us the insane 4k lbs. crushproof rating. </p>
<p>Since we use TPU, the speaker also absorbs shocks better than most speakers, which are generally made from abs plastics. ABS plastics are weaker and more brittle than TPU, but are used because...well...they're about half the price to use. TPU has insanely high shear and elastic strange, making it great in impact situations - for us, from 100ft. to the dirt, or from 30ft onto concrete, guaranteed. </p>
<p><strong>2) THE SOUND IS SUMPTUOUS</strong> - this is the speaker which caused one blind tester to say it had, ""depth and clarity that gave [them] chills."" We cannot summarize it better. Of all its totable competitors, this 86db, 50w speaker takes the cake. It quite simply has a fuller sound, and better bass. The 6 massive drivers and 2 T.I. amplifiers just do their job. As one of our team members said, ""Think B*se, but bulletproof."" </p>

<p><strong>RoamProof Customer Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The following are reviews from real backers/customers of our first speaker on the market, the MacroBoom. The MacroBoom is our entry level speaker, the ""younger brother"" of the Macro.II, and the ""child"" of the GigaBoom. </p>
<p>""I found RoamProof browsing through Kickstarter and backed their unit MacroBoom. After months of waiting my unit arrived and I was thrilled with its performance. Unfortunately an issue arose with the speaker and it stopped working. I contacted RoamProof, provided proof and they promptly arranged a replacement, which has been roaming with me for ages. The quality of the unit is great and so is their service. Good stuff guys, I'm happy to support such a stellar company.""</p>
<p>-C Williams (MacroBoom Backer)</p>
<p>""This really is an awesome piece of equipment! And it definitely is equipment. Heavy duty as all get out! The mounting attachments you get really open up the possibilities of where you can conveniently take this thing. I listen to it in my truck because it sounds better than my old worn out sound system. I put it on my dirtbike and essentially drag this thing through the mud. Hang it up in the shower. Doesn't skip a beat.""</p>
<p>-R. H. K (MacroBoom Amazon Customer)</p>
<p>""This is an amazing piece of audio technology, and it's virtually indestructible. I take it everywhere - beach, pool, hiking, biking. I even take it in the shower! I have been wanting a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for years and am so glad that I waited to purchase one because the MacroBoom IP67 has more features and functions than I could have imagined. But the best part of what this unit has to offer is the crystal clear, rich and deep soundscape and the long battery life. I would recommend the MacroBoom to anyone who is wanting a portable, rugged speaker with audiophile sound quality. This is truly a top shelf product!""</p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>RoamProof has been established and running for 2+ years. We've successfully run 3 crowdfunding campaigns, and continue to sell product daily through our website, Amazon, and other online retailers. We have a function system of customer service, and a small team that manages each piece of the manufacturing process. We have fully functioning samples and are poised for full production.</p>
<p>As with any Kickstarter, our primary/only risk is timing. We have established a history with backers and customers who trust us to deliver product. We will ALWAYS prioritize quality over timelines - However, we feel our predictions for delivery are conservative, and can be easily met. Feel free to find out more about us in the team section, or at RoamProof.com</p>
</div></div>","The Gigaboom is our Staff Picked favorite speaker. It's  comes in two color ways, raw or gunmetal. Staff picked because:
1) THE BUILD IS BEEFY - it's constructed with a double-shot injected FULL TPU from body to core. Most speakers use over or single shot molding processes that aren't nearly as strong/thick. This process allows us the insane 4k lbs. crushproof rating. 
Since we use TPU, the speaker also absorbs shocks better than most speakers, which are generally made from abs plastics. ABS plastics are weaker and more brittle than TPU, but are used because...well...they're about half the price to use. TPU has insanely high shear and elastic strange, making it great in impact situations - for us, from 100ft. to the dirt, or from 30ft onto concrete, guaranteed. 
2) THE SOUND IS SUMPTUOUS - this is the speaker which caused one blind tester to say it had, ""depth and clarity that gave [them] chills."" We cannot summarize it better. Of all its totable competitors, this 86db, 50w speaker takes the cake. It quite simply has a fuller sound, and better bass. The 6 massive drivers and 2 T.I. amplifiers just do their job. As one of our team members said, ""Think B*se, but bulletproof.""

Yes, it is entirely possible and entirely reasonable to incorporate the magic of music and entertainment into your outdoor excursions. With SolarBox Mini, the most rugged outdoor mini speaker, it is easier to do so than ever before.    Built with original high power monocrystalline silicon solar panels, a new generation of solar charging technology, Solarbox mini can play music continuously for 30 minutes after 30 minutes of solar charging in clear sunlight.The SolarBox Mini can also be charged by using the usb.

</div></div>","Unparalleled Audio Quality
 
Android platform by default exposes an audio engine that is generalized for every application used by the normal users. However, for the serious audiophile it is often insufficient in terms of quality, audio customization and lossless file format compatibility.
Air Tunes is the ultimate solution for this problem, offering a high resolution 32-bit audio processing engine developed from the native HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer), which is focused on delivering the greatest audio quality from your device without any compromise.
 
 
Studio Quality DSPs
 
Air Tunes provides the following set of studio quality multi-channel DSPs for the professionals to tweak their sound with precision.
1. 8 Band EQ + Preamp with Bandwidth customization2. Cycore Bass Boost (R)3. Compressor with parameter controls4. Dynamic amplification module5. Stereo Enhancer with customizable room spread6. Reverb with customizable controls7. Phaser with customizable controls8. Chorus effect with customization9. Wah Effect with customization
 
 
Cycore Bass Boost (R)
 
This bass boosting module is a groundbreaking audio processing component included in our set of DSPs which provides a smooth and strong subsonic bass enhancement.  The specialty of this module is that it does not distort or dip the volume to achieve the bass boost like most other modules.
Based on countless hours of research and development in formulating a bass boosting solution for various audio applications, the team at Intellogic developed this proprietary processing module based on concepts of Harmonic Product Spectrum and Psycho-Acoustics . This bass boosting technique and implementation is unrivaled by any bass booster currently available in music players (especially in Android).
 
 
Stunning and Intuitive UI
 

 
 
The user interface of Air Tunes is a gem of its own making it easier to explore your music library with ease. You can easily find your music by browsing through the songs, artists, albums or your own playlists. The custom playlists are also streamlined with the player user interface allowing you to manage them easily.
There is gesture support embedded in the player to help you cycle through your songs efficiently. There are more customization options available in Settings which allow you to customize layouts, behaviors and various preferences.
 

 
The aesthetics are optimized to make the UI stunning with unobtrusive animations. The player connects to online services on demand to synchronize your artwork so that it is much more pleasurable browsing your albums and favorite artists.
 
 
DSP and Effects Preset Management
 
We understand that every song deserves its own audio tweaking and settings, which is why we have presets to allow you to save your effects and DSP settings so that you can set them immediately when required. This will allow you to maintain your own curated presets for each type of music you listen to.
 
 
Independent Effect Chain
 
Effects can either be set on the main playback channel or separate playback channels to achieve high end mixing quality without losing the raw audio data in the signal chain. This means stacking audio multiple effects will not affect other effects as you use separate effect channels.

<p><br/>Medical hearing-aids are small, expensive devices which are rarely covered by health insurance. With product costs ranging from $900 to $5000, the devices are a luxury few can afford.

<p>1) Symphony's battery charger has not been designed. Upon its completion, the charger will require testing. All portions of the design and testing process take time.

All the features and every little detail interconnect to create One flawless audio DAC.With Adapt, you don't have to listen to a low quality, low volume music or carry another expensive bulky Digital Audio Player (DAP). Just a single Adapt completely upgrades your audio effortlessly.Adapt will be an upgrade to your ear and your life. Enjoy the sunset and enjoy the rain with the Adapt on your hands.<Adapt is the solution!> 

Adapt Reference is for serious music listeners, music producers, hardcore gamers and anyone who wants to fully expand their listening experience. 

Adapt Standard is an affordable Hi-Fi DAC for audiophile beginners and enthusiasts who have interests in better music. 
 The concept of Adapt started in February 2018. The audio DACs out in the market were bulky, expensive, or had a mediocre performance. So, we wanted to make a compact, reasonably priced, high performing DAC that can last long in this fast-changing world.  <First Design concept sketches> ESS, the best performer in the audio market  Adapt uses the latest ESS 32bit SABRE Hi-Fi ES9218P DAC with the Triple Filtered Power Supply for the most stable yet dynamic audio experience. For MUSIC LOVERS: Have a seat in the middle of a small classic jazz bar at late-night or in a large orchestra hall waiting for the orchestra to finish their tuning.For GAMERS: Catch the slightest noise your enemy makes in the wide open grass field.  ULTRA HIGH precision soundThe two temperature compensated crystal oscillators(TCXO) in the Adapt Reference model differentiates itself from other portable audio DAC having more clean and consistent sound just like the high-end audio system.In simpler words, A quartz watch is off by 50 seconds per month and a regular digital device's Oscillator is off by 25 seconds per month. But, TCXO is off by only 1.3 seconds per month. That's some accuracy.Adapt Reference has two TCXOs dedicated to 44.1kHz and 48kHz native sampling rates. Dedicated frequency minimizes the even the tiniest error during the sampling rate conversion process. Adapt's high precision and high resolution gives you the best sound experience for any audio playback. Even the normal compressed music files and Youtube videos will sound more clean and accurate.  Just like HI-FI  Adapt product design represents the identity of Dense. In its simple compact design, innovative twin heat sink design using aluminum alloy keeps the hardware inside maintain an optimum temperature. Stable system temperature means stable performance and extended product life.Adapt = Power in simplicityAdapt can connect to iPhones, Android phones, macOS, Windows PC with a single USB Type C connection.

<h3><strong><font color=""#D50F6D"">We Built A Better Mouse Trap... Introducing The HumBug</font></strong></h3>
<p>After three years in the making we are proud to introduce the HumBug UltraSonic pest repeller device. Designed for greater coverage distance due to our high output xt-33 transducer. Designed to repel most household pests.</p>
<p>Just plug your HumBug into a wall outlet anywhere you have an insect problem in your house and watch the HumBug go to work!</p>

<h3><strong><font color=""#D50F6D"">Safe For Humans &amp; Household Pets!</font></strong></h3>
<p>The Humbug operates at 32khz-55khz creating auditory stress in most pests driving them away. Humans don't hear above 20khz with the exception being children hearing as high as 30khz making the HumBug silent and harmless. Cats &amp; dogs hear frequencies between 22khz-25khz making it safe for your household pets.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of the pests that hear the frequencies of the HumBug:</p>

</div></div>","We Built A Better Mouse Trap... Introducing The HumBug
After three years in the making we are proud to introduce the HumBug UltraSonic pest repeller device. Designed for greater coverage distance due to our high output xt-33 transducer. Designed to repel most household pests.
Just plug your HumBug into a wall outlet anywhere you have an insect problem in your house and watch the HumBug go to work!


 
Safe For Humans & Household Pets!
The Humbug operates at 32khz-55khz creating auditory stress in most pests driving them away. Humans don't hear above 20khz with the exception being children hearing as high as 30khz making the HumBug silent and harmless. Cats & dogs hear frequencies between 22khz-25khz making it safe for your household pets.
Here is a partial list of the pests that hear the frequencies of the HumBug:

Mosquitoes
Fleas
House Fly
Spiders
Cockroaches
Ants
Grasshoppers
Mice
Rats
Bats



 
Built To Work In Your Country
Talking with team of engineers we insisted that the Humbug was capable of working in almost every country.  All you have to do is back our project and based on the country we are shipping to we will make sure you have the correct plug type to work in your country. See Image below for available socket types. So where does the HumBug work? 

United States
Canada
Mexico
Japan
Europe
South America
Asia
Russia
United Kingdom
Ireland
Australia
New Zealand
China
Argentina & more



 
Easy To Install & Economical To Operate
Just plug it into any existing wall socket and watch it go to work. You can expect to see results in as little as 7 days. The cost to operate each unit is approximately 20 cents USD per month when using it 24 hours a day. The total electrical draw on each unit is less than 2 watts.

<br/>FUSION Headphones</h2>
<p>We believe music has the power to relieve and uplift people’s soul. With FUSION headphones, you can hear the sound you should hear - the bass, the detail, the dynamics. Most importantly, you feel <i>the power of the music</i>.</p>
<p>As an original brand manufacturer that specializes in designing and developing ultra-high quality headphones, OneAudio aims to create a <i>wireless professional DJ headphone</i> for DJs and music lovers.</p>

<p>We have worked on the functional verification of our product as DJ headphones are usually wired, but ours are <strong>wired </strong>and<strong> wireless</strong>. We came up with an ingenious design on <strong>dual-duty cable</strong>, which allows free conversions between <strong>3.5mm </strong>and<strong> 6.3mm jacks</strong>. Also, we addressed the pain point of DJ headphones needing adapters by achieving the feature of <strong>adapter-free</strong>.</p>

<p>We are passionate about DJ headphones; therefore, we have worked hard on their design: swiveling earcups, comfortable headband, defined sound, portability, and loudness of sound. </p>
<p>We also created a <strong>jack lock system</strong>, so no matter how much movement there is, the cable will not get off the headphones' port. This is a great plus for DJs and musicians.</p>

We believe music has the power to relieve and uplift people’s soul. With FUSION headphones, you can hear the sound you should hear - the bass, the detail, the dynamics. Most importantly, you feel the power of the music.
As an original brand manufacturer that specializes in designing and developing ultra-high quality headphones, OneAudio aims to create a wireless professional DJ headphone for DJs and music lovers.

We have worked on the functional verification of our product as DJ headphones are usually wired, but ours are wired and wireless. We came up with an ingenious design on dual-duty cable, which allows free conversions between 3.5mm and 6.3mm jacks. Also, we addressed the pain point of DJ headphones needing adapters by achieving the feature of adapter-free.

Our team has worked hard to accomplish this project, we have designed the product’s appearance, structure, and electronic components. The next steps include carrying out mass production and conducting a frequent market analysis to ensure the stability of the product. 

 
This project is very important to us. We strive to design and create professional and high-quality sound headphones. We have carefully listened to people's feedback. With your contribution, we will successfully complete these DJ + Wireless headphones: multifunctional, faster, and better.

FUSION Features
DJ DEVICE

We are passionate about DJ headphones; therefore, we have worked hard on their design: swiveling earcups, comfortable headband, defined sound, portability, and loudness of sound. 
We also created a jack lock system, so no matter how much movement there is, the cable will not get off the headphones' port. This is a great plus for DJs and musicians.
 
DUAL-DUTY CABLE & ADAPTER-FREE

This is a unique cable, specifically designed for FUSION headphones. On one of the ends there is a 3.5mm jack and on the other end there is a 6.3mm jack. This great feature allows free conversations and most importantly: it's adapter-free! Perfect for mixers, electric guitars, keyboards, and more.


BLUETOOTH

We wanted to take these headphones to the next level, so we made them wired and wireless! With Bluetooth version 4.0, FUSION headphones are designed to easily pair with other Bluetooth devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. 
 
MUSIC SHARING
Two or more headphones can be connected to one another to allow the feature of music sharing. Pair your device via Bluetooth and share your tunes through the dual-duty cable!

<p>It is our firm belief that placement of microphones in front of your ear, in the arms of your glasses, gives better directional hearing, especially in noisy environments. With the BLU we added more advantages to this.</p>
<p>The BLU is an innovative pair of hearing glasses with Bluetooth™ connectivity based on air conduction. Each of the temples contains cutting edge electronics and multiple tiny microphones that pick up sounds from the front and separate them from background noise.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449494060/luhcsoqbaydjaglej0mq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>BLU’s proven, and patented, multi-microphone technology helps you optimize your directional hearing when in a noisy environment. Its wireless capability means that, via Bluetooth™ , you can connect to enabled devices like smartphones – iOS and Android, tablets and personal computers.</p>
<p>The BLU comes with a free application (iOS and Android supported) that you can easily download in the App Store or Google Play Store. With the BLU App you can easily:</p>

<br/>
<p>We wanted the BLU to be rechargeable and still to be able to use continuously, without having the need for charging intervals. So we equipped the temples with easy to switch battery units. Each BLU comes with an extra set of batteries and a compact travel-proof charging unit. You can charge extra batteries while traveling, while using your BLU!</p>

<p>The temples are modular units, meaning that the BLU-units contain all the necessary functions and can be fitted with different color faceplates to match a growing selection of different color glasses frames. The use of interchangeable faceplates at the temples (available in six different lengths) allows customization, each user to be fitted with their own comfortable, matching temple lengths.</p>
<p>The BLU units are built with carefully selected materials which are widely used for glasses frames and temples, and in hearing aids. They are known for their light weight, durability and with scientifically proven suitability for continuous skin contact.</p>

<p>We have already created a prototype of the BLU and we have made several BLU hearing glasses for tests with customers. From there we obtained much usable feedback which helped us to improve the BLU to the (prototype) product we have now. With your funds we can finally make the BLU a reality and start producing! Start producing is the main thing we need your contribution for. But of course we have lots of ideas for future improvements for the BLU: </p>

</div></div>","The majority of people who need sound amplification (1 out of 10 persons; meaning you probably know a person with a hearing problem yourself) in daily life already wear glasses. A combination of improving vision and hearing in one product is convenient and comfortable. In the past hearing glasses were very popular, but bulky. With the BLU we have reinvented hearing glasses and use state of the art wireless technology in combination with fashionable frames.We hear you think: Why the BLU instead of normal hearing aids and glasses?Traditional hearing aids sit behind the ear and have one microphone that picks up sound, which is processed electronically with the hearing aid. They amplify sounds coming from all directions, meaning that you hear each and every noise amplified, thus creating an uncomfortable experience. Now, the BLU makes it possible to amplify sounds from the front, while dampening surround noise. Each arm of the glasses has an array of microphones to optimize hearing in noisy situations. The placement of the microphones in front of your ear creates a unique directionality. You can switch between hearing around you and hearing a person talk from the direction you look.
Besides better hearing, the BLU makes it possible to listen to your favorite music and pick up a phone call with your glasses. This innovation can literally change the way you hear and perceive things around you!



Chat with your friends at a busy terrace


Hear every word during your business meeting

Understanding in noisy environments






It is our firm belief that placement of microphones in front of your ear, in the arms of your glasses, gives better directional hearing, especially in noisy environments. With the BLU we added more advantages to this.
The BLU is an innovative pair of hearing glasses with Bluetooth™ connectivity based on air conduction. Each of the temples contains cutting edge electronics and multiple tiny microphones that pick up sounds from the front and separate them from background noise.



BLU’s proven, and patented, multi-microphone technology helps you optimize your directional hearing when in a noisy environment. Its wireless capability means that, via Bluetooth™ , you can connect to enabled devices like smartphones – iOS and Android, tablets and personal computers.
The BLU comes with a free application (iOS and Android supported) that you can easily download in the App Store or Google Play Store. With the BLU App you can easily:






We wanted the BLU to be rechargeable and still to be able to use continuously, without having the need for charging intervals. So we equipped the temples with easy to switch battery units. Each BLU comes with an extra set of batteries and a compact travel-proof charging unit. You can charge extra batteries while traveling, while using your BLU!







We have developed an App for the BLU (iOS and Android supported), which lets you customize your listening experience by changing programs, volume, and high-low tones. The free Varibel App is available in the App Store and Google Play Store.
With the BLU App you can easily:
Switch between programs & adjust your hearing settings


Listen to your favorite music



Answer hands-free phone calls with one touch








We have invented and patented a groundbreaking solution that combines multiple microphones, advanced microprocessor algorithms and high-tech hardware fitted into glasses temples. By adding wireless features we have developed the BLU. The BLU was developed with comfort, ease of use and style in mind.


 



The temples are modular units, meaning that the BLU-units contain all the necessary functions and can be fitted with different color faceplates to match a growing selection of different color glasses frames. The use of interchangeable faceplates at the temples (available in six different lengths) allows customization, each user to be fitted with their own comfortable, matching temple lengths.
The BLU units are built with carefully selected materials which are widely used for glasses frames and temples, and in hearing aids. They are known for their light weight, durability and with scientifically proven suitability for continuous skin contact.








To match your individual style we offer eight stylish frames – four stainless steel frames and four acetate frames. All frames can have prescription lenses fitted by your local optician. It is also possible to have sunglasses lenses fitted into the frames. All frames are available in six colors: black, grey, blue, brown, ruby and red.







BLU is a Bluetooth enabled pair of hearing glasses. It combines Varibel’s patented hearing aid microphone array technology with wireless capabilities. They are the world’s most versatile hearing glasses. 



Excellent directivity (dual-mic array) 


Bluetooth wireless technology 


Stereo audio streaming 


Audio control through App 


Rechargeable Li-Poly battery 


Hands-free phone use • Four-channel WDRC 


Adaptive feedback canceling 


Adaptive noise reduction 


12 Band Gain Equalizer 


Low battery warning (tone adjustments) 


Programmable through VariFit software














We have already created a prototype of the BLU and we have made several BLU hearing glasses for tests with customers. From there we obtained much usable feedback which helped us to improve the BLU to the (prototype) product we have now. With your funds we can finally make the BLU a reality and start producing! Start producing is the main thing we need your contribution for. But of course we have lots of ideas for future improvements for the BLU: 



Extend the BLU with bone conduction possibility 


Possibility to fit the BLU technology to every kind of frames


Improvements of the BLU appearance like: smaller batteries, smaller temples 







Varibel consists of a team of people with years of experience in audiology, audio signal processing, product design and development, materials and ergonomics, all within the medical device industry. Over the last two years we have done extensive testing, prototyping and gathered user feedback. Not only from end users but also from distributors and dispensers. We have partnered with companies with a broad background in product development, PCB development, signal processing and Bluetooth development, all already working in the hearing aid and audio industry and also with optometrists for frame development.











Varibel Innovations bv. is a small, innovative team. Based on our experience in the hearing aid industry and hearing loss we know how to help people. Help them feel more confident and happy in several noisy situations.   






Your feedback will help us, and your support will enable us to reach our goals and beyond! Please support our campaign and spread the word!

<h3><strong>Short Summary<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497551967/wsnvw1hplrpuhqgjls0a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<p>As a  kid coming from a single parent home growing up in the tropical surroundings of the Rainforests of Far North Queensland , Australia, full of waterfalls &amp; wildlife, I remember what it was like suddenly to only have 1 parent in my home life. For solace I sought refuge in music, jazz music in particular, and decided at 13 that I wanted to become a jazz musician. Through the life long journey it has been to follow that unlikely dream into reality as a musician &amp; recording artist in New York City, even  as the music industry  changed drastically making it very difficult to  barely survive sometimes, one thing never changed.. my quest for quality sound &amp; tone and to somehow make a little difference in the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497552857/zwcra4mx7j0fvprustnp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When it comes to music, the warmth of real wood stands out to my ear. Perhaps because I grew up in such a natural environment I notice it more. So when I see people listening to music on plastic headphones, I tell myself they just must not know what they’re missing. If they could only experience the true analogue warmth that comes with music delivered via genuine wood.. without the audiophile high end pricing and awkward designs , that would make them fall in love with their favorite  music  all over again. Additionally, I thought by creating a pair of opulent, genuine wooden headphones that not only delivered that analogue warmth, but were an accessory one would proudly and stylishly wear publicly, together we could make the birthday of a child from a single parent home like the one I came from a little bit brighter, because together we will gift them a pair of our JC Stylles ""WoodyBuds"" on your behalf... when you upgrade your ears to luxury !</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497553256/gszjj3jo02hrygulqmyh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So I set out to conceive an affordable range of boutique, luxury, analogue headphones made from genuine wood, that also allows you to pay it forward to a child from a single parent family, and after self-funding 2 years and testing products, I bring you JC Stylles Opulears!</p>
<p>Our initial collection (that's me, my family, and a couple of part time assistants) comes in a range of quality woods and luxurious designs that in comparison to plastic models, feels like you're sporting a Lexus for your ears, and are currently worn by several professional musicians, including Grammy winners.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496268369/vlz9nbcvskbypiist55d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i><u>THE JAZZ SERIES </u>is a funky fashionable look, currently available in Cherrywood with a piano lacquered gloss finish, and a 100% genuine leather headband accessory for durability, complimented by microfiber cushioned ears for comfort. The 50mm drivers inside the wooden outers deliver a frequency response of 20-20,000 Hz, as do all of our models. Great for the beach, park, riding the subway, even the gym.</i></strong></p>

<h3><i><strong>Singularly , as an Artist in today's music business which has changed drastically over the last decade,  independent of corporate financial backing,  I have developed JC Stylles Opulears over 2 years with my own limited funds, as I have with all my recordings and products. This has included establishing relationships with various suppliers and manufacturers and securing trademarks. I have gone about  as far as possible  to this point with self funding and a couple of  part time assistants, and the aim with this campaign is to raise enough funds to open the first small JC Stylles Opulears store in New York City, and  be able to order  more substantial stock. Currently the minimal stock as seen here has been ordered for testing and sampling.  As I work with several international manufacturers to bring my product range to fruition, I have minimum order requirements to meet including refining further packaging.</strong></i></h3>

<h3>Q-How soon can you supply your Perks?</h3>
<p>A-Due to us already working with our suppliers/manufacturers from the US to Asia, we have a system that allows us to order smaller quantities and fulfill quickly within 2-3 weeks of placing the order on completion of the campaign.</p>
<h3>Q- So are you ready to release the product on a larger scale?</h3>
<p>A- Yes, that is the reason for this campaign after 2 years of trialing, developing and testing. We now need further funds to grow to the next level.</p>
<h3>Q- You mentioned a warranty, how does that work?</h3>
<p>A-We are confidant in our product, however in the unlikely event it fails to function, we offer a full replacement warranty for free for 12 months from date of purchase. Just provide the date and copy of receipt of purchase and send to opulears@jcstylles,com so we can handle that for you.</p>
<h3>Q- You mentioned the Jazz Series is available currently in Cherrywood for now, but will also be available in Walnut later on, why is this?</h3>
<p>A- Our testing trials included Walnut. We are keeping the range at a minimal size currently for the campaign, but will be able to increase the range to include Walnut after we have raised the funds we are seeking. We are comfortable meeting the demand for Cherrywood initially, so we only wish to  offer that which we know we can supply now.</p>
<h3>Q- You mentioned the Executive is going to be made in Ebony, but it is shown in Walnut, why is that?</h3>
<p>A- Our supplier was able to provide us with an earlier sample of the product to test, so we took it  eager to trial it on the understanding that it is actually going to be manufactured from Ebony. We want to offer at least 3 distinctly different woods to cater to the different aesthetic tastes of our customers.</p>
<h3>Q-Where are you planning to open a store in New York City?</h3>
<p>A- We have been assessing various area's, but the last bastion of affordability seems to be downtown around the East Village area, so that will be our focus in regards to keeping costs low as we build this business. We want to have a physical presence in addition to the web, as we would like to  also be able to offer customers a chance to trade-in their plastic headphones for JC Stylles Opulears, and get a decent discount on the retail price when doing so. We will need a physical shop and a 2nd hand retailers license in order to provide that service.</p>
<h3>Q- Is the Buds4Buds gift registry already working?</h3>
<p>A- We have gifted our ""WoodyBuds"" already to a few select children as part of our trials and they have been very well received and appreciated. We hope you will join us in making this a successful program together with a true win-win outcome in this pay-it -forward initiative.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
As a  kid coming from a single parent home growing up in the tropical surroundings of the Rainforests of Far North Queensland , Australia, full of waterfalls & wildlife, I remember what it was like suddenly to only have 1 parent in my home life. For solace I sought refuge in music, jazz music in particular, and decided at 13 that I wanted to become a jazz musician. Through the life long journey it has been to follow that unlikely dream into reality as a musician & recording artist in New York City, even  as the music industry  changed drastically making it very difficult to  barely survive sometimes, one thing never changed.. my quest for quality sound & tone and to somehow make a little difference in the world.

When it comes to music, the warmth of real wood stands out to my ear. Perhaps because I grew up in such a natural environment I notice it more. So when I see people listening to music on plastic headphones, I tell myself they just must not know what they’re missing. If they could only experience the true analogue warmth that comes with music delivered via genuine wood.. without the audiophile high end pricing and awkward designs , that would make them fall in love with their favorite  music  all over again. Additionally, I thought by creating a pair of opulent, genuine wooden headphones that not only delivered that analogue warmth, but were an accessory one would proudly and stylishly wear publicly, together we could make the birthday of a child from a single parent home like the one I came from a little bit brighter, because together we will gift them a pair of our JC Stylles ""WoodyBuds"" on your behalf... when you upgrade your ears to luxury !

So I set out to conceive an affordable range of boutique, luxury, analogue headphones made from genuine wood, that also allows you to pay it forward to a child from a single parent family, and after self-funding 2 years and testing products, I bring you JC Stylles Opulears!
Our initial collection (that's me, my family, and a couple of part time assistants) comes in a range of quality woods and luxurious designs that in comparison to plastic models, feels like you're sporting a Lexus for your ears, and are currently worn by several professional musicians, including Grammy winners.
THE JAZZ SERIES is a funky fashionable look, currently available in Cherrywood with a piano lacquered gloss finish, and a 100% genuine leather headband accessory for durability, complimented by microfiber cushioned ears for comfort. The 50mm drivers inside the wooden outers deliver a frequency response of 20-20,000 Hz, as do all of our models. Great for the beach, park, riding the subway, even the gym.
  

The Executive- shown below in Walnut, will actually be available in a darker ebony in a matt finish. It  is a streamlined  design with  minimal branding, and a luxurious super soft  cushioned headband. They fit snugly with excellent sound isolation as a result, have swiveling earpieces for easy optional wear when not in use, and are perfect for the office or  professional, looking for a classy headphone that compliments their style. 
 

The top of the line Signature Series comes in walnut wood with a matt finish, and embossed branding on a longer classic outer ear, and the luxurious headband cushioning also found on the Executive. The longer earpiece design is a great choice for taller wearers, and allows the ear to be fully ensconced inside the ear cushions. All models come with a luxury dust / carrybag and  a free 1 year warranty.



Singularly , as an Artist in today's music business which has changed drastically over the last decade,  independent of corporate financial backing,  I have developed JC Stylles Opulears over 2 years with my own limited funds, as I have with all my recordings and products. This has included establishing relationships with various suppliers and manufacturers and securing trademarks. I have gone about  as far as possible  to this point with self funding and a couple of  part time assistants, and the aim with this campaign is to raise enough funds to open the first small JC Stylles Opulears store in New York City, and  be able to order  more substantial stock. Currently the minimal stock as seen here has been ordered for testing and sampling.  As I work with several international manufacturers to bring my product range to fruition, I have minimum order requirements to meet including refining further packaging.

Perhaps they are interested in a speaker with a modern design that will be a great add-on for their office desk, or even for their surround system at home. Others are interested in a durable speaker that will be able to handle their adventurous lifestyles.We in Phonics Technologies decided to come up with a solution and created the Submarine--a waterproof speaker with an elegant design featuring True Wireless Stereo technology to connect up to 2 Submarine speakers at the same time, creating a clear and loud 360° sound.  True Wireless 360° Surround Sound  Submarine is a high-quality speaker that delivers amazing sound. We have implemented a process called True Wireless Stereo that delivers a superior listening experience. Hardware and software intelligently fuse right and left channels from two Submarine Speakers to create 360 degrees of sound, similar to a high-end surround system. While pairing two Submarine speakers, the first speaker paired to your Bluetooth enabled device will act as the master and play the right channel of sound, and the speaker that is paired to the master speaker will be called the slave and play the left channel of sound, creating an intelligent wireless surround system. No more wires for your surround systems at home or portable speakers. Optimized Wireless Performance with Bluetooth 4.2 Technology The Phonics Submarine speakers use Bluetooth 4.2 Technology for an optimized wireless performance. The chip is faster, has better range, and is more energy efficient. You can listen for a longer period of time without compromising the fidelity of sound or battery life. Compatible With Any Bluetooth Enabled Device Once the Submarine speakers are connected to your phone, you can control them easily through any Bluetooth enabled device, such as a smart phone, tablet, smart TV, and more. Fill Your Space With True Sound          Submarine speakers have a connectivity range of over 10 meters, large enough to fill any room with high-quality sound. Long Lasting Battery Life With the Submarine, you will stay connected with up to 8 hours of battery life. Key Features 
   Modern & Sophisticated Design We have designed and engineered the Submarine True Wireless Stereo Speakers with a modern and durable design. With the highest quality materials, we created a continuous, smooth matte surface for the Submarine speakers that is both comfortable to touch and elegant to view. The modern design will fit any setting in your lifestyle. Refresh your living room with a new modern look and replace your old, wired surround system. Add true wireless sound to your daily routine, or take the Submarine with you for a memorable adventure. Take The Submarine Anywhere You GoThe Submarine features sophisticated yet simple design. With IP65 rated structure, the Submarine is water and dust resistant. Take your Submarine speaker anywhere you--go indoors and outdoors. Whether you are hiking the great trail or relaxing with friends by the pool, making a mad play on the court, or listening to tunes in the office, the submarine speakers can do it all with 360 degrees of rich sound.   Easy to Use 4-Buttons Display We created the Submarine speakers with an easy to use control panel. With only 4 buttons, the Submarine speakers are easy to connect, use, and enjoy.  The Submarine Vs. Traditional Speaker How Can I Back This Project? Pick a perk and become a backer for our project to bring the Submarine to life. Choose one of the options to back us, and as a thank you, we will guarantee the lowest prices and deliver them to you before everyone else.  Timeline What's in the box?   One Year Warranty ​At Phonics Technologies we stand behind our name and products. Each Submarine speaker by Phonics Technologies comes with a 1-year full warranty.

Hear your favorite games like it’s the first time. Drown gives you the ability to perceive your in-game surroundings more accurately - as if it were a true physical space. You feel like you’re actually in the game.  TACTILE EARPHONESVS. TYPICAL HEADSETS  Drown uses physics to trigger all three audio pathways to your brain, while passively blockingoutside noise.1. Patent-pending acoustic waveguides sculpt the sound waves through a tactile system using scientifically tuned, high-end dynamic graphene drivers.2. Physical awareness is created through bone and cartilage conduction. This gives you a deep, powerful bass response, to help you feel and perceive sound.3. Spatial awareness is created by vibrations that stimulate nerves. This is how you perceive height, depth, and distance. These tactile audio waves deliver a hyper-realistic sound environment.Drown brings these components together to create a unique and powerful audio experience. 
 
 
  Using data from thousands of ear scans and 3D-printed prototypes put in hundreds of ears, we have developed customizable sizing options.A range of inserts are included with every Drown order, so you can find the fit that’s best for you.

 

​
To find the best fit start with a small size and increase as needed. It should feel snug and secure in your ear.

Music is her forever companion along every journey.In 2018 high summer, Amanda took another trip into the wilderness of Africa. Camping outside of an ancient tribe, the young chief of the tribe was surprisingly hospitable and welcoming to modern visitors. Amanda was invited into the campsite and immediately captivated by the tiger Totem hang in on the entrance. The totem stands for “Power, Fearlessness, and Ferocity”, it’s the spiritual animal for every warrior of the tribe ever since 2500 years ago. Although nowadays tiger is believed to become extinct in this continent.She was impressed by the wild vitality of this artwork. The beautiful, robust, and mysterious figure engraved into Amanda’s memory for a long time after the trip ended.When she came back from her trip, she was inspired to think about the possibility of developing a tiger-shaped headset. Among all the mediocre boring design of all wireless headphones, this spirit animal stood out as a break from the norm, it certainly will be a completely revolutionary unique design and extremely eye-catching compared with other daily earphones.By combining dynamic modern design with ancient totem.

Not only the shape is wild, but the heart is the same.

Some of you may know me as the first rapper in the Jewish music scene. I’m talking years before Shlock Rock came along. And when reggae star Matisyahu was in diapers. I know I’m dating myself but it’s true! I was teaching in the inner-city of Buffalo back in the 70’s when rap first started to make it on a few mainstream radio stations.</p><p>My students were my teachers back then and since I’ve always been into music, rap became a big part of my repertoire. But I never limited myself to one genre of music. Growing up in the small city of Buffalo, NY, with parents who went to see Ella, Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Count Basie, and more, I learned to appreciate all forms of music, from rap to reggae, from blues to bluegrass, and from jazz to doo-wop. LP's were always playing in the abode and it was obvious to me that music had some deep power to it. As a teenager, often on the rebellious side, I began to wonder how music might be used to help people lead better lives... to create some positive changes in the world around us.</p><p>Some of you make know me from the education scene. I’ve been working in the field of special needs for over 35 years and found music to be a therapeutic goldmine. You can check out my music videos on YouTube. It was an honor for me to receive the <i><strong>Teacher of the Year</strong></i> award from two different public school districts in my career, including Buffalo, NY in 1980 and from the Broward County Public schools in south Florida in 2007. I still do music &amp; drama therapy for Broward, which is the country’s 6th largest school district. In 2008 I was one of five teachers from across America to be inducted into the <i><strong>National Teachers Hall of Fame</strong></i>. I’ve been at the forefront of educational leadership and continue to fight for the rights of individuals with special needs and for those coming from disadvantaged situations. Check out my music video dedication called “<i><strong>Singing For Angels</strong></i>” on YouTube.</p><p>Some of you know me from my work in the Crown Heights community. I was asked by the mayor’s office to be the liaison between the Hassidic and Black communities shortly after the race riots there in 1991. Working together with several African-American leaders, including Richard Green &amp; Rev. Paul Chandler, we formed Project CURE, a grassroots organization dedicated to fostering mutual respect and harmony. I wrote a book (“<i><strong>Sharing Turf – Race Relations After The Crown Heights Riots</strong></i>”) about these amazing experiences. </p><p>Our work back then, and to this very day, continues to inspire me. There were lots of doubters. Back in the early 90's the media often portrayed blacks &amp; Jews as enemies. Despite this as well as other obstacles - such as our own stereotypes about each other, we were able to move forward. And fairly quickly! We got the NY Knicks to dedicate one game a season to racial harmony. Our joint Project CURE basketball team played during halftime at the famous MSG - Madison Square Garden! My music group opened for Al Green and The Winans at Gospel Night in Brooklyn just a year after the riots took place. Shortly after that we played in DC for the US Congress! What started as a small grassroots community effort turned into this exciting fast paced organization. We found ourselves on pretty much every major TV show at the time, including ESPN, Montel Williams, Donahue, and more.</p><p>Showtime turned my book into a major movie called “<i><strong>Crown Heights.</strong></i>” The movie, which also used three of my original songs, stars <i><strong>Howie Mandel</strong></i> as myself (no joke!) and is available on Netflix and other major internet sites and bookstores.<br/><br/>This past summer 2016 was the 25th reunion of us coming together as a more united community. Our band,<i><strong> Dr. Laz &amp; The CURE</strong></i>, was the closing act for the <i><strong>One Crown Heights</strong></i> event, featured at a large, community park near the Brooklyn Children’s Museum.

It’s called <u><i><strong>Increase The Peace</strong></i></u>, which was our motto back then and continues to be at the forefront of our beliefs and actions. I actually wrote the tune about a year before the Crown Heights riots, as I was tired of hearing about various negative racial incidents that were hitting the NYC area back then.

</div><h2><strong>How the E9 was born</strong></h2><p>The E9’s inventor, Stephanie England, is always on the go. A full-time Engineering student and maker of practical gadgets, she enjoys experimenting with electrical circuits and building her own guitars. Music gives her inspiration; in her creative projects and as she shuffles around her workshop building her next neat piece of tech. She’s a loyal fan of vintage audio devices, but dislikes the encumbrance of the audio wires while doing work. Wanting to reconcile both her passions for music and tech, she began experimenting with various wireless transmitters available on the market. She was unhappy with the sound quality and fluidity they provided, so she set out to build a device which could respond to her specific requirements. Hence, the E9 was born.</p><p> </p><p>Creating a device that will allow individuals to recycle, reuse, and reduce their carbon footprint while also reducing the cost of purchasing new audio devices. For us at E9, this is what it’s all about.  Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the E9 was created in the spare bedroom workshop of a University student. As a result, funds available are limited and the mass production of the E9 is fully dependent on you, our future potential backers. This crowd-funding campaign is the last step to make E9 a possibility.</p><p> </p><p>The E9 is a fully patented device and is currently in its last phase of development before heading to production.

How the E9 was bornThe E9’s inventor, Stephanie England, is always on the go. A full-time Engineering student and maker of practical gadgets, she enjoys experimenting with electrical circuits and building her own guitars. Music gives her inspiration; in her creative projects and as she shuffles around her workshop building her next neat piece of tech. She’s a loyal fan of vintage audio devices, but dislikes the encumbrance of the audio wires while doing work. Wanting to reconcile both her passions for music and tech, she began experimenting with various wireless transmitters available on the market. She was unhappy with the sound quality and fluidity they provided, so she set out to build a device which could respond to her specific requirements. Hence, the E9 was born. Creating a device that will allow individuals to recycle, reuse, and reduce their carbon footprint while also reducing the cost of purchasing new audio devices. For us at E9, this is what it’s all about.  Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the E9 was created in the spare bedroom workshop of a University student. As a result, funds available are limited and the mass production of the E9 is fully dependent on you, our future potential backers. This crowd-funding campaign is the last step to make E9 a possibility. The E9 is a fully patented device and is currently in its last phase of development before heading to production. This crowd-funding campaign is what will allow E9 to move into its production phase, and finally, to you, our backers. At this very moment, we have fully working prototypes of the E9 and various mock-ups of the potential final look for the device. In our crowdfunding video, you can see the rectangular test prototype we’ve been working with. The final version will resemble the more elegant mock-ups in the pictures below. In terms of production, we have quotes for both PCB and exterior case from a local Canadian manufacturer that will be able to build and assemble our product.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a graduating college student who is passionate about creating premium audio experiences.  I founded Acoustic Masterminds® with the mission to make it convenient to diagnose acoustic issues in every environment, bringing excellent, enjoyable acoustic experiences to the world.  Whether I’m at a conference, concert, or restaurant, I am aware of the acoustic issues that cause increased stress and listening fatigue.  Room Calc will make it quick and easy for acoustic service providers to diagnosis and offer solutions for all types of venues.  Currently, the acoustic diagnosis process is only cost-effective for larger venues.  My goal is to make this process more accessible for small to medium venues, while still supporting large venues.</p>
<p>In May 2017, I will earn a B.S. in Digital Audio Technology from Cogswell College. I have created sound design for linear and interactive media and have a decade of experience in live sound mixing, recording and post production at church. These experiences have created a desire to solve acoustic issues for all types of rooms and venues.</p>
<p>This past November (2016), Acoustic Masterminds® launched AcoustiTools™ which also served as a proof-of-concept for the 3D technology that Acoustic Room Modes Calculator™ (Room Calc™) incorporates. </p>
<p>With the goal to launch in late 2017, Room Calc is a professional tool that provides an easy way to solve acoustic problems with a mobile device. Room Calc takes a venue’s dimensions, constructs a model of the venue, and calculates room modes and other problematic acoustic issues for analysis and treatment solutions. Using advanced technology coming to mobile devices, Room Calc rapidly models, analyzes, and diagnoses complex acoustic issues, displaying the results using Augmented Reality.</p>
<p><u>Ways your contribution will help</u></p>
<p>Room Calc is currently under development.  To complete the development for launch, funds are needed to cover development costs, cloud service costs to run the core functions of Room Calc on secure servers, legal fees for creating contracts such as Terms &amp; Conditions, Privacy Policies, patent application, etc.</p>
<p>With your contribution, I will be able to complete Room Calc, revolutionize the acoustic service field, and further the vision of making all your audio experiences enjoyable.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the past few months, I have been mentored in creating financial projections and have concluded that it will take $112,000 to bring Room Calc to market.  I have depleted my own savings, as well as received help from family to bring AcoustiTools to market, and am now launching this campaign to make Room Calc a reality.</p>
<p><u>Your contribution will go straight into funding costs such as:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Development (expert programming in emerging technology)</li>
<li>Cloud service costs (to run the core functions of Room Calc on secure servers)</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Room Calc will not only impact the acoustics industry but my goal is for Room Calc to impact and improve everyone's auditory life, reducing brain stress and fatigue.</p>
<p>Have you ever had trouble hearing someone across the table from you in a restaurant, cafe, or a similar setting no matter how loud you were talking?  Have you ever had trouble understanding a speaker in a conference hall, office, or elsewhere?  These are experiences I envision solving by revolutionizing the acoustic industry with the speedy, mobile diagnostic technology of Room Calc.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge has been defining my target market to break into the acoustic industry with Room Calc.</p>
<p>The solution I've found is targeting acoustic service providers such as those who sell treatment and those who survey the rooms and venues needing treatment.</p>
<p>I have been actively making connections and have several advisers experienced in different areas.  My mentors have been a massive help to me as I've been navigating the challenges of a start-up company.  By having this net of wisdom to draw upon, I am confident that Room Calc will launch successfully with your contribution.</p>

BUILDING ON SUCCESS
Thanks to hundreds of loyal and satisfied backers we have successfully fulfilled our first crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. With the help of our loyal fan base, backer- and headphone community we gratefully continued to develop and manufacture our headphone line-up on this successful concept.
Mitchell & Johnson headphones will reproduce the natural sounding recordings you like so much and will get you the lifelike movie playback.  



 
NEW LINE-UP

 
How much as we love to tailor our products to the customer needs, this is an InDemand campaign, meaning the headphones have already been designed, manufactured, tested and even been stored, ready to ship to you.

The JP1 has a nice extra twist in that the right ear cup does twist at 90 degrees so if you're mixing or DJ-ing you get the benefit.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p></div>","Pi 2 Design is proud to announce the 502DAC family of High Resolution Audio Shields for the Raspberry Pi platform!
 
The 502DAC & 502DAC PRO are fully compliant Raspberry Pi shields designed to deliver the highest quality audio for your music listening. This powerful combination is suitable for the bedroom, the living room, game room or anywhere high quality sound is desired. Add an inexpensive USB drive to form a high performance, compact music server system. Stream music from local storage or from your phone over Wifi. Control the system with your phone over WiFI or Bluetooth.
 

Open source, off-the-shelf software allows the 502DAC/Raspberry Pi combination to serve as an audio endpoint that can be situated in multiple rooms throughout your house or office, playing music from a central server, remotely controlled from your phone. It also allows you to stream music directly from your phone (Airplay, Airfoil, UPnP/DLNA, etc).
 

The 502DAC family consists of the 502DAC and the 502DAC PRO. Each version is designed with the high performance WM8804 AES/EBU digital audio transmitter coupled with a high-Resolution 24-Bit@192Khz DAC. Dual ultra-low noise clock oscillators are used to ensure that files based on 44.1K or 48K frame rates (up to 16/24-Bit @ 176.4Khz/192Khz) play flawlessly.
The digital side of the 502DAC family consists of transformer isolated single ended AES/EBU and balanced output AES/EBU, as well as optical S/PDIF. Ultra-low noise Voltage Regulators are used to provide proper operating voltage to this circuitry thus eliminating coupled noise from the Raspberry Pi platform. The digital outputs from this section deliver bit perfect digital data with noise levels below -150dBu! No PC/USB based transport can beat this performance. The 502DAC and 502DAC Pro digital sections deliver the following specifications:

WM8804 AES/EBU Digital Audio Transmitter 
Dual Low Noise, Low Jitter NDK NZ2520SD Oscillators
Bit Perfect 16-Bit and 24-Bit Digital Transport

Why Our Audio Shield?
We know there are many choices for audio shields designed to run on the Raspberry Pi. We believe the 502DAC and 502DAC Pro stand above those shields when it comes to features and, ultimately, the sound. With the best digital audio quality you can buy and two levels of outstanding analog audio quality, the 502DAC or 502DAC Pro may well be the last audio shields you buy! Compare for yourself:

 
What You Get
Getting the most out of your music collection does not require large sums of money, nor large stacks of gear. If you know how to use a Raspberry Pi, then you already have the basis of a superb sound system without spending thousands!
And if you don't know Raspberry Pi from Apple Pie or Lemon Meringue (my favorite) there are great, easy to follow guides like this one from Likehacker:
http://lifehacker.com/5976912/a-beginners-guide-to-diying-with-the-raspberry-pi?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pulsenews
Get started today, so you can be ready when the campaign is over and your 502DAC or 502DAC Pro arrives!
 
Why We Need You
The 502DAC is already in early production and the 502DAC Pro is just entering production. This campaign is designed to spread the word to the larger marketplace of those who want High-Resolution, Audiophile quality sound using the incredibly flexible, inexpensive Raspberry Pi platform.

<p>You will be the first in the world to get the uStream One in July as soon as our production stock arrives in the UK</p>
<p>The uStream One system consists of two identical wireless bluetooth active speakers that use TWS technology to link to each other without any wires or connecting cables, making them truly wireless. Just plug them in to the mains power and they will connect to each other within in seconds, allowing you to connect any Bluetooth music source as a single device, just like you would with your wireless ear pods.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone, laptop,  tablet or even a smart device like an Amazon Echo or Google Home, nominating the uStream One's as your preferred playback device.</p>
<p>A huge amount of people are now getting their music from YouTube and listening on their smartphones and tablets. With the uStream One you can now listen to all that music in glorious stereo- something you cannot do with any networked audio device.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the system is the sound quality, I can assure you it is comparable to systems that are three times the price.</p>

My express intent is to make the enjoyment of beautifully recorded stereo music, simpler and more accessible for everyone.
I have been responsible for designing many award winning audio units in the past having worked in the consumer electronics industry since 1980. I am also a professional musician and recording artist and have performed extensively around the world.
This campaign has been created to raise awareness for our first product to be launched under the Mitchell Acoustics brand, the uStream One true wireless Bluetooth stereo speaker set. A simple to use twin speaker system that works purely on Bluetooth to deliver sound quality with serious Hi-Fi credentials.
 


You will be the first in the world to get the uStream One in July as soon as our production stock arrives in the UK
The uStream One system consists of two identical wireless bluetooth active speakers that use TWS technology to link to each other without any wires or connecting cables, making them truly wireless. Just plug them in to the mains power and they will connect to each other within in seconds, allowing you to connect any Bluetooth music source as a single device, just like you would with your wireless ear pods.
You can use a smartphone, laptop,  tablet or even a smart device like an Amazon Echo or Google Home, nominating the uStream One's as your preferred playback device.
A huge amount of people are now getting their music from YouTube and listening on their smartphones and tablets. With the uStream One you can now listen to all that music in glorious stereo- something you cannot do with any networked audio device.
The most important aspect of the system is the sound quality, I can assure you it is comparable to systems that are three times the price.

Some reviews from people in the music industry:
Steve Sidwell: 
Award Winning Producer/Arranger
Grammy, Tony, Emmy award winner
Clients include: Robbie Williams, Michael Buble, Jeff Beck, McFly and many more
""I spend hours in a recording studio and I can safely say, at the price point, there is nothing beats the uStream One speakers for pure musical power and convenience. A truly stunning sound from such a small system""
 
John Etchells:
Renowned Sound Engineer
over 200 credits
Artists include: Queen, Dire Straits, David Gilmour, George Harrison & many more

""The first time I heard the uStream One speakers I was actually blown away. At the price there really is nothing that sounds this good and in such a convenient package..my wife loves them too!""

<p>Inspired​ ​by​ ​our​ ​DJ​ ​experience​ ​over​ ​the​ ​last​ ​decade,​ ​the​ ​acoustical​ ​nature​ ​of​ ​our​ ​design​ ​creates a​ ​self-enclosed​ ​studio​ ​sound​ ​box​ ​around​ ​your​ ​ear​ ​that​ ​delivers​ ​high​ ​fidelity​ ​sound​ ​with​ ​deep​ ​rich bass,​ ​balanced​ ​midrange,​ ​and​ ​crisp,​ ​clear​ ​highs.  </p>
<p>Sound Huggles offer excellent full-range performance with deep, punchy bass that is filling and not over exaggerated. The mid-range is perfectly balanced with excellent voice and horn reproduction. The high frequencies are crisp and clean, not overly bright or piercing.</p>
<p>The headphones deliver an expansive sound stage with impressive depth and excellent stereo separation. On well mixed tracks, it sounds as if the audio experience is coming from a space much wider than the confines of the headphones.</p>

<h2>WHY INDIEGOGO?<br/> </h2>
<p>We’re starting our journey with Indiegogo because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in Sound Huggle’s development and release of new innovations. Through Indiegogo, we’re not just pre-selling our headphones to early adopters, but rather, forging relationships with a passionate community of creative and fashion-tech conscious individuals.  </p>
<p>Indiegogo, your feedback will enable us to bring the latest fashion audio-tech gear to market, and your support will enable us to continue to pour our blood, sweat, and tears to build a product that you’ll absolutely love.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>HOW WILL WE USE THESE FUNDS?<br/> </h2>
<p>We will be using these funds to create our first production orders of Sound Huggle headphone earmuffs, including all the tooling, molds and components that these complex designs need across knit patterns and designs.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">TO OUR INTERNATIONAL BACKERS</span><br/> </h2>
<p>This project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Sound Huggles worldwide.</p>

<p>In case of cancellation, we will refund your pledge. Additional taxes and duties may apply to your international order, as designated by the authorities in your country. You may need to take care of them yourself when receiving the shipment.</p>
<p>Please note that there is no way for us to charge an additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward.</p>
<p>These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.</p>

</div></div>","You love listening to music and speaking cord-free on your phone.  Unfortunately, if you live in a city with cold winters, this proves to be a challenge.
After one too many commutes in Chicago and New York and experiencing earaches and freezing ears, we decided to come up with a solution.
And that's why we created Sound Huggle.


The World's Coziest Hi-Fidelity Headphones
Our patented headphones are built to be the world’s most comfortable, durable headphones that deliver premium studio sound quality.  Unlock your next bold adventure with these premium bluetooth headphone earmuffs that make cold listening possible.  






 

 


 


Inspired​ ​by​ ​our​ ​DJ​ ​experience​ ​over​ ​the​ ​last​ ​decade,​ ​the​ ​acoustical​ ​nature​ ​of​ ​our​ ​design​ ​creates a​ ​self-enclosed​ ​studio​ ​sound​ ​box​ ​around​ ​your​ ​ear​ ​that​ ​delivers​ ​high​ ​fidelity​ ​sound​ ​with​ ​deep​ ​rich bass,​ ​balanced​ ​midrange,​ ​and​ ​crisp,​ ​clear​ ​highs.  
Sound Huggles offer excellent full-range performance with deep, punchy bass that is filling and not over exaggerated. The mid-range is perfectly balanced with excellent voice and horn reproduction. The high frequencies are crisp and clean, not overly bright or piercing.
The headphones deliver an expansive sound stage with impressive depth and excellent stereo separation. On well mixed tracks, it sounds as if the audio experience is coming from a space much wider than the confines of the headphones.

WHY INDIEGOGO? 
We’re starting our journey with Indiegogo because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in Sound Huggle’s development and release of new innovations. Through Indiegogo, we’re not just pre-selling our headphones to early adopters, but rather, forging relationships with a passionate community of creative and fashion-tech conscious individuals.  
Indiegogo, your feedback will enable us to bring the latest fashion audio-tech gear to market, and your support will enable us to continue to pour our blood, sweat, and tears to build a product that you’ll absolutely love.
 
HOW WILL WE USE THESE FUNDS? 
We will be using these funds to create our first production orders of Sound Huggle headphone earmuffs, including all the tooling, molds and components that these complex designs need across knit patterns and designs.
 

TO OUR INTERNATIONAL BACKERS 
This project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Sound Huggles worldwide.
Please note that shipping to any country outside the United States and Canada may be delayed or canceled depending on the feasibility of local product approval requirements or local import regulations.
In case of cancellation, we will refund your pledge. Additional taxes and duties may apply to your international order, as designated by the authorities in your country. You may need to take care of them yourself when receiving the shipment.
Please note that there is no way for us to charge an additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward.
These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.
 
FOR OUR EARLY BACKERS​
Our team is excited to launch the world’s most durable, comfortable headphones that deliver studio sound quality. However, we know that the most important part of our process is that we fulfill our promise to you.
We have worked through the challenges of managing production, packaging, and rest assured your Sound Huggles have shipped worldwide earlier this month. We can't wait to get the Sound Huggles into your hands.

</h2>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">iLepo ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) embeds microphones and powered electronics in the earphone to remove background noise. The iLepo ANC earphone captures ambient noise and re-creates an inverse sound wave in real-time to feed it back in the earphones to cancel out most of the sound around the user. Especially good at blocking out low frequencies in surrounding noise for public transportation such as for bus, train, subway or airplane engines and at other noisy places with constant noise. This also allows the user to experience better audio clarity at lower volume, effectively healthier to hearing.</span></h4>

If you want to post a video review of either of these on your YouTube account, you can apply to get a free review unit here.
iLepo ANC features:

iLepo ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) embeds microphones and powered electronics in the earphone to remove background noise. The iLepo ANC earphone captures ambient noise and re-creates an inverse sound wave in real-time to feed it back in the earphones to cancel out most of the sound around the user. Especially good at blocking out low frequencies in surrounding noise for public transportation such as for bus, train, subway or airplane engines and at other noisy places with constant noise. This also allows the user to experience better audio clarity at lower volume, effectively healthier to hearing.



iLepo ANC provides the market's best value high quality noise-cancelling earphones!
Only 30 grams and easy to carry. 10 hours battery life in fully ANC mode.


iLepo ANC will use standard MicroUSB port for charging if this Indiegogo campaign reaches at least 2000 backers for the iLepo ANC earphones, otherwise they will use the current special NanoUSB connector to be charged using the special NanoUSB cable provided.

iLepo ANC ON/OFF buttons can easily switch on/off ANC mode with up to 10-hour battery life, the earphones also work fine without battery power left but without the noise cancelling function active.

<p>We will begin shipping to all our backers within 60 days from the end of our campaign. With invaluable lessons learnt during the logistical phase of our last 'Smart Buckle' Campaign we are fully confident of meeting this shipping goal.</p>
<p>We believe in the best of crowdfunding where a community of innovators and thinkers supports exciting new ideas that DELIVER. We proved this with Smart Buckle, shipping a fully certified product to over a thousand backers within a couple of months of closing our campaign. We had a few lessons through that process and it has honed us to be even more precise and relentlessly focussed on quality and execution. That is why you can feel confident that when we say Guaranteed Shipping with 60 days of Poppins campaign close, we mean it!</p>

<p>This Poppins crowdfund comes on the back of a successful crowdfunding campaign we ran for our first product, Smart Buckle. We launched Smart Buckle on Kickstarter during the summer and had nearly a thousand backers pre-ordering the product from over 30 countries. We are proud not only to have shipped 100% of Smart Buckles to our backers but also to have won distribution agreements across the world. In less that 120 days since launch we have shipped over 7,000 units all over the world. </p>

<p><strong>Why we built Poppins?</strong></p>
<p>We found over the last several months with the onslaught of wireless headphones emerging into the market that all our current devices will be obsolete and be put away into our desk drawers. That is not too cool for the planet. We looked around and found that the wireless adaptors for headphones were either poorly designed or just another crowdfunding promise which never got delivered by large funded projects. It took us less than 9 months to get here with a real product that we use everyday in our offices and in our homes. We made it for our own use and decided that we can make it for all those who fell in love with it. It is round cookie like device. The way it is designed, the magnet just clips on to you like a little force of gravity. It is seamless with your fashion and a really cool fidgety toy to play with - we promise, once you play with it, you will keep playing. And of course, we wanted hi-def sound quality with the best quality transmission of audio, when we made Poppins. We enjoy it daily, and we bring you the same.</p>
<p>Simple. With Purpose.</p>

<p>With that we do not see any risks on production, however we are holding ourselves to a high standard by promising our crowd fund backers that we WILL SHIP YOUR PRODUCT WITHIN 60 DAYS from the close of the campaign.

<p>The key challenge for us now is to run an effective campaign that brings awareness of this incredible product to a mainstream audience who value their timepiece and who agree with our philosophy that rejuvenating your existing product is a better way to live than simply buying new products all the time.</p>

We will begin shipping to all our backers within 60 days from the end of our campaign. With invaluable lessons learnt during the logistical phase of our last 'Smart Buckle' Campaign we are fully confident of meeting this shipping goal.
We believe in the best of crowdfunding where a community of innovators and thinkers supports exciting new ideas that DELIVER. We proved this with Smart Buckle, shipping a fully certified product to over a thousand backers within a couple of months of closing our campaign. We had a few lessons through that process and it has honed us to be even more precise and relentlessly focussed on quality and execution. That is why you can feel confident that when we say Guaranteed Shipping with 60 days of Poppins campaign close, we mean it!

Our Track Record 
This Poppins crowdfund comes on the back of a successful crowdfunding campaign we ran for our first product, Smart Buckle. We launched Smart Buckle on Kickstarter during the summer and had nearly a thousand backers pre-ordering the product from over 30 countries. We are proud not only to have shipped 100% of Smart Buckles to our backers but also to have won distribution agreements across the world. In less that 120 days since launch we have shipped over 7,000 units all over the world. 
Proof is in the facts, check here. You can also visit us here.
Why we built Poppins?
We found over the last several months with the onslaught of wireless headphones emerging into the market that all our current devices will be obsolete and be put away into our desk drawers. That is not too cool for the planet. We looked around and found that the wireless adaptors for headphones were either poorly designed or just another crowdfunding promise which never got delivered by large funded projects. It took us less than 9 months to get here with a real product that we use everyday in our offices and in our homes. We made it for our own use and decided that we can make it for all those who fell in love with it. It is round cookie like device. The way it is designed, the magnet just clips on to you like a little force of gravity. It is seamless with your fashion and a really cool fidgety toy to play with - we promise, once you play with it, you will keep playing. And of course, we wanted hi-def sound quality with the best quality transmission of audio, when we made Poppins. We enjoy it daily, and we bring you the same.
Simple. With Purpose.

The Bluetooth speaker takes advantage of the Speakase's (suitcase) acoustic-enhancing internal volume.  The back of the drivers are open to the cabinet, creating an acoustic loading that enhances and boosts the audio experience through its carefully engineered structure.

</ul><h2>The WHY:</h2><h3>Bringing craftsmanship back to music.</h3><p>I'm a guitar player. And a gear nerd too. But at some point I feel like I got a little lost in all the flashing lights and cables. What if I could fall in love with simply <i>music</i> again? Do you remember when you first picked up a guitar, or when you nailed your first solo, or wrote a song for someone you love? Do you remember the pure joy and inspiration that came from simply <i>being </i>in the music? I believe that we, as musicians, can become distracted and lose sight of our craft. I believe that the gear we invest in has the power to either push us forward or hold us back. The idea behind <i>Artistry Audio</i> is to bring my fellow musicians back to making music. This is my craft...I set out to design an overdrive pedal that not only gets you excited to play music, but is aesthetically rich, pleasing to the eyes and ears, and free of distractions. I've given enough functionality for the musician to preserve and carve out their own unique tone while keeping it simple enough to keep you focused on what's important.</p><h2> </h2><h2>The Journey:</h2><h3>No Compromises.</h3><p>The journey to building the first finished prototype was not an easy one. Many late nights in the shop away from family, and many early mornings at the computer have gone into making the <i><strong>Tradesman </strong></i>the best that it could be. Learning the characteristics of different lumber, testing and sourcing the best parts and materials, figuring out how to take a solid block of wood, maintain its beauty and integrity while turning it into a rich and useful tool; all this was a daunting challenge, but the end result couldn't have turned out any better. I'm truly proud to have developed a pedal where every single unit I build is a one-of-a-kind and no two are the same.  I have had the opportunity to collaborate with a man by the name of Todd Dozier of <i>Tone </i><i>Whizard</i><i> Labs</i>. He is an expert in his field, passionate about his craft, and truly knows great tone. When I conceptualized the idea for the circuitry and brought it to him, he knew exactly how to bring it to life. The circuitry designed by Todd was carefully thought out and only high quality, studio-grade components were sourced. The more musicians that join me on my journey, the more I will be able to craft and accomplish for everyone involved.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506404444/lax5arnpw5qyroiyqdcz.png"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>The funds used from the campaign will be invested into tools and equipment that will allow me to stay ahead of demand, turn out consistently high-quality pedals, and start development on future effects!

<p>The x9 pedals with MIDI control can be mounted in rack and they can be controlled remotely by a MIDI foot controller or by a computer.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We fully expect to deliver ERL total wireless earbuds with exceptional quality according to our timeline. However, even the most well-planned manufacturing process can meet unpredictable hiccups. <br/><br/>Most likely to present difficulties is the Bluetooth Antenna Design. A sensitive component which requires extensive debugging and testing to create the strongest possible connection—both of which may require time. <br/><br/>The Android and iOS companion apps will be rigorously tested and optimized to deliver a tight user experience. Depending on feedback, aspects of the app may need to be reworked and fine-tuned. </p>
<p>International backers: We will ship ERL worldwide, with the exception of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region, which in the past have ranged from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries, to as much as 200% for certain South American countries. </p>
<p>Estimated delivery: Each reward tier may have a different estimated shipment month. While we do not expect these to change, the estimated shipment month might shift. We will provide updates if the estimated shipment date changes. At any time up until your headphone has shipped, you may request a full refund by emailing support@geterl.com. </p>
<p>Warranty: We stand firmly behind our products. Each ERL earphone includes a 7-day (after you receive it) money back guarantee, 6-month free exchange period, and 1-year limited warranty. Need help? We're here for you. If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign has closed, you can always reach us at support@geterl.com. </p>
<p>Battery life: Actual battery life will vary based on how the earphones are used.</p>
<p>Trademarks: Trademarks and names that belong to third parties. Water resistance: ERL is sweat resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water – like unforeseeable rain – won’t ruin your device, but submerging the device is not recommended.</p>
<p>We will continue working to ensure that we deliver our backers a low-risk, high-quality product on time.</p>

<p></p>
<h5>How loud is Ohmni 360°</h5>
<p>Ohmni 360° is able to reach 99dB which is in line with speakers that sell in the $200-400 range. Ohmni 360° smart X1 equalizer outputs the purest sound for every song you play thus enabling you to listen to music in a premium way no other portable speaker in the market can match.</p>

<p>Yes, Ohmni will work with any smartphone that has Bluetooth capability. </p>
<p><span><b>What are smart connect pair capabilities?</b></span></p>
<p>Smart connect lets you connect other Ohmni speakers in different rooms to stream the same music or you can set Ohmni speakers side by side to play in stereo mode using left and right channels.</p>
<p><b><span>Does Ohmni 360</span>°<span> have a 3.5mm port?</span></b></p>
<p>No, but we might consider adding it if we hear many of you would like this feature.</p>
<p><b><span>When I set an alarm, will Ohmni 360</span>° <span>stay in closed or open position?</span></b></p>
<p>Ohmni position will be closed. When the alarm is set to go off it will open and play an alarm sound or song depending on your choice when setting the alarm.</p>
<p><span><b>Can I set the alarm without my smartphone using the Ohmni dashboard app?</b></span></p>
<p>Yes, you don't need the ohmni dashboard app to control the speaker or set alarms. Ohmni has its own built-in dashboard to control the LED lights, alarms etc.</p>
<p><span><b>How long does the battery last?</b></span></p>
<p>Ohmni's rechargeable battery lasts approximately 20 hours with heavy use and recharges to full capacity in 6 hours.</p>

<p><span>Yes. </span></p>
<p><b><span>How well will Ohmni 360</span>°<span> hold up against drops or water spills?</span></b></p>
<p>Upon designing Ohmni 360° we realized making our Ohmni shock proof and splash proof would be essential to everyday use. We made Ohmni 360° resistant to 5ft drops and water splash proof. However, Ohmni's screen is not shatter proof so we made it easy to replace the glass and all speakers come with ""1"" complimentary replacement screen free of charge (additional replacement screens will be sold for $15 each + S/H)</p>
<p><span><b>What is the Ohmni cloud?</b></span></p>
<p>It will be a cloud service that you can set to automatically upload and backup all your music stored in Ohmni 360° or smartphone, enabling you to access all your songs and playlists from the cloud on any device. </p>
<p><span><b>Will the Ohmni cloud be free?</b></span></p>
<p>Upon receiving your Ohmni 360° speaker and registering it you will receive a 1-year free complimentary subscription code for 1TB of storage. If you buy additional speakers you can use those codes to receive additional free years or additional storage. Subscription will run at $9.99 per month.</p>
<p><span><b>How will I be able to play songs that my friends are playing?</b></span></p>
<p>There are two ways to play the same music as your friends.</p>
<p>1: You can listen to the songs your friends are listening to by creating a shared group playlist. The share group playlist allows you to add and remove songs from the playlist, shuffle play and take turns being the DJ. </p>
<p>2: Generate a unique code which you can give to anyone to access your playlist. The code will allow your friends to listen to what your are listening or download music from your Ohmni cloud account. You can set each code with restrictions. Restrictions will enable you to set certain time limits on which your friends can access your music profile or only let them listen to the music you are currently playing. </p>
<p><b><span>Will Ohmni 360</span>° <span>sync the music stored in my phone automatically?</span></b></p>
<p>Yes and no. You can set Ohmni 360° to sync music everyday, once a week, once a month or manually. As soon as your phone is connected to the same WiFi network as Ohmni 360° it will sync new songs from your phone to the Ohmni cloud or Ohmni storage depending on your settings.</p>
<p><span><b>Is Ohmni voice recognition similar to that of Amazon echo or Siri?</b></span></p>
<p>Yes, it's similar to both. Ohmni 360° is powered by Google Now which you will be able to control within close distance of the speaker itself or use your smartphone to speak to Ohmni 360° which comes in handy if you are in another room from where Ohmni 360° is located.</p>
<p><b><span>How much internal storage does Ohmni 360</span>° <span>have?</span></b></p>
<p> It will be a little bit less than 64GB because the OS will take some storage space. </p>
<p><b><span>Will Ohmni 360</span>°<span> have aptX?</span></b></p>
<p>Yes, Ohmni will also have the aptX codec allowing you to get the best Bluetooth sound experience while streaming your favorite music.</p>

<p>Whenever I look at an object I immediately think of what I could do to modify it and improve it.  Should I add or remove something to make it look better? The same thing happens when I enter a house I’ve never seen before, I start knocking down walls in my head, and I virtually restyle the place down to the furniture.</p>
<p>I love music and as all music lovers, I like to hear a clear and clean sound!</p>
<p>One day I decided to buy a new amplifier, so I surfed the net and noticed Synthesis had some that where very cool. I instantly thought that a company that cared so much for design would find my idea for a new amplifier simply brilliant. Looking at the pictures on the site I saw a Synthesis amp that has a plexiglass case, so you can see what it looks like inside. There! That was the right idea to start on, though I had left out a tiny detail…would the owner of the company take me seriously or think me crazy? </p>
<p>So the idea behind the making of B-Wiz1708 is that if something is worth doing it's worth doing well, even those things you don't understand at first. <br/>I wanted to see the finished product, because to see really means touching with your eyes!</p>
<p>The collaboration between Kiral for the design of B-Wiz1708 and Synthesis for its making and production, aimed to create an amplifier with distinctive features, we wanted the best: an excellent sound and a cool design.  An amp is the kind of object you try to hide in a house, by sticking it on a bookshelf; we made it into something fashionable, happy and colourful, beautiful to look at!</p>
<p>The plexiglass case has a coloured mask and you can choose your color between green, red, turquoise or fuxia, and all the commands are lit up by a different colour led light according to the source the music comes from, USB, CD and so forth.  B-Wiz1708 can be personalized, becoming a home ware object that people will notice in your house!<br/><br/>The Black version is more technical, maybe a bit more masculine and elegant: will be perfect in every house.</p>
<p>Music…Music…it makes you dream, it relaxes you or it charges you up to the point a crazy dance is due! <br/>This is why the mood lighting system helps you create the right atmosphere as you can choose between 12 different types of cover light intensity so it will create YOUR personal ed unique atmosphere!</p>

</div></div>","Developed for amplification by audiophiles
B-Wiz 1708 is an integrated amplifier designed to reproduce the most meticulous sonic details of each chord, beat and audio composition. Suitable for old school vinyl as much as the latest digital files, B-Wiz 1708 is fully equipped to handle all different needs.It is equipped with Bluetooth which makes it fully operating at any time... who does not have a phone or tablet always on? Moreover it has high-performance headphone output, for a highly emotional listening. Equipped with a digital class D amplifier, carefully selected for the sound quality, B-Wiz  1708 offers an output power of 250W never seen before! Particular attention was paid to the layout of the amplifier, short signal path and particular care in the power supply ensure an impeccable sound. The case made entirely of metal, it guarantees high strength and vibration, further enhancing the sound quality. Insulating plastic legs with soft rubber base ensures high stability.



Kiral Creative Solutions is an ambitious startup who wants to bring new design in every day objects. Who says that something commonly used can't be improved?This is our mission, bring objects to new life by changing their design.Today is, obviously, the B-Wiz 1708 ... tomorrow can be the B-Wiz speakers (we're working on it!), a new amp or everything else!Synthesis Art in Music is a 25 years old company which is excellence in made in Italy. Famous and apreciated worldwide especially for tube amplifiers, decided to run the risk to make something that different and, in some way, crazy.They reserve such a maniacal attention to any particular that are the perfect partner in crime!







We decided to launch this Indiegogo campaign to share with you the enthusiasm and the love we have for the B-Wiz1708!
It is not just an exceptional amplifier but a true object of design entirely made in Italy, from design to production.
We have done everything for our goal to be as reasonable as possible to ensure to start production. This is why we opted for the flexible fund: to ensure that everyone has appreciated and preordained the B-Wiz 1708 on Indiegogo receives it.
There's more, because the B-Wiz 1708 is just the beginning for us as we would like it to become a real line, we are already studying the speakers to match and who knows .what else!
Ideas and enthusiasm are not lacking, we just need your help, in return we offer you the opportunity to have your B-Wiz 1708 at unthinkable price outside the Indiegogo campaign!The B-Wiz 1708, as all Synthesis products, is made by hand in their factory in Italy. All metalwork, boards, transformers and major parts are Italian-made and sourced locally. They take a great deal of pride in their workmanship, and so will you.




Whenever I look at an object I immediately think of what I could do to modify it and improve it.  Should I add or remove something to make it look better? The same thing happens when I enter a house I’ve never seen before, I start knocking down walls in my head, and I virtually restyle the place down to the furniture.
I love music and as all music lovers, I like to hear a clear and clean sound!
One day I decided to buy a new amplifier, so I surfed the net and noticed Synthesis had some that where very cool. I instantly thought that a company that cared so much for design would find my idea for a new amplifier simply brilliant. Looking at the pictures on the site I saw a Synthesis amp that has a plexiglass case, so you can see what it looks like inside. There! That was the right idea to start on, though I had left out a tiny detail…would the owner of the company take me seriously or think me crazy? 
So the idea behind the making of B-Wiz1708 is that if something is worth doing it's worth doing well, even those things you don't understand at first. I wanted to see the finished product, because to see really means touching with your eyes!
The collaboration between Kiral for the design of B-Wiz1708 and Synthesis for its making and production, aimed to create an amplifier with distinctive features, we wanted the best: an excellent sound and a cool design.  An amp is the kind of object you try to hide in a house, by sticking it on a bookshelf; we made it into something fashionable, happy and colourful, beautiful to look at!
The plexiglass case has a coloured mask and you can choose your color between green, red, turquoise or fuxia, and all the commands are lit up by a different colour led light according to the source the music comes from, USB, CD and so forth.  B-Wiz1708 can be personalized, becoming a home ware object that people will notice in your house!The Black version is more technical, maybe a bit more masculine and elegant: will be perfect in every house.
Music…Music…it makes you dream, it relaxes you or it charges you up to the point a crazy dance is due! This is why the mood lighting system helps you create the right atmosphere as you can choose between 12 different types of cover light intensity so it will create YOUR personal ed unique atmosphere!



There is no risks whatsoever! We guarantee that every single B-Wiz 1708 will be preordered on indiegogo will be produced and sent to you!This is why we decided to keep our goal reasonable! We hope to reach the goal in a very short time and to overcome it!
The challenge is that you can have a MADE IN ITALY design product in your house at a very special price.By preordering the B-Wiz 1708 during the indiegogo campaign you'll save at least $ 599

<h3>Exquisite design. Exceptional acoustic engineering. A work of art.</h3>
<p><strong>Symphonica</strong> is a totally acoustic horn speaker that boosts and enhances the sound from your phone without using electronics. Engineers at major phone companies like Apple and Samsung have created audio systems in their flagship model phones that produce very high quality audio. However there is only so much they can do within the limited internal space of your phone, and so <i><strong>Symphonica channels this high quality audio through its specially designed, patented acoustic chamber, where it is equalized and amplified and emerges with added body, warmth, and tone that fills your personal listening space with an expansive sound field of music with high clarity and a full dynamic range.</strong></i> <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496802312/qplsmvyh0i0rtkl6vofp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div><p><i>Symphonica's smooth, balanced sound provides the perfect environment for concentration, meditation, relaxation, or for drifting off to a peaceful and restful sleep.</i><br/><br/><strong>Symphonica</strong> brings <strong>beauty, grace and warmth</strong> back to a world dominated by flat and unfeeling plastic iPhone and Android accessories. Its <strong>inspired, passionate design</strong> reminds that form can be just as valuable as function, <strong>capturing the attention and drawing the eye to the flowing, organic patterns expressed in the natural wood grain</strong>. <strong>Symphonica</strong> breaks the mold of boring utilitarian accessories and instead makes a bold statement about uniting the elements of art, fashion, and function all together in one outstanding product.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496802691/bhuksnts2xlyplfj2xvb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Graceful Curves, Flowing Lines, the Alluring Beauty of Natural Wood</i></p></div><div>
<h3>An Inspired Fusion of Art and Science</h3>
<p>Designed by a veteran audio engineer with decades of experience creating high end audio products and constructed from environmentally friendly woods, Symphonica needs no electricity yet boosts the sound from your iPhone speaker by more than 6db, filling the room by acoustically amplifying its sound. Symphonica also enhances the sound, adding the body and warmth that you've been missing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496803223/fsnxyiqusnedneq8xghw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Symphonica is made from sustainably harvested hardwoods and wastes no electricity, making it the greenest, most environmentally-friendly way to display, charge, and amplify your smartphone,</i></p>
<h3>What about those small Bluetooth Speakers? Why would I want a Symphonica instead?</h3>
<p>Bluetooth speakers are convenient, but <strong>not only do they look unremarkable, they mostly sound unremarkable as well</strong>.

<strong>Meet the Symphonica Team</strong> </h3>
<p>Here's a bit of information about the small team that has worked to make Symphonica a reality:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497328761/r2si4lskpvnbd7svx3kp.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Freddie Kwoh - Inventor of Symphonica</i></p>
<p>Symphonica was designed by <strong>Frederick (""Freddie"") Kwoh</strong>, a seasoned audio engineer and product designer who held multiple patents in the field. Drawing from his decades of experience he has created an innovative and beautiful product which not only serves a useful purpose, but pleases the eye as well. Sadly, Freddie passed away last year, but we are continuing on to fulfill his dream of bringing this product to market.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497328834/wmgryae3qwizni8agidb.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Marc Edwards - Marketing, Sales &amp; Distribution</strong></p>
<p>No matter how great the product, you still need to let people know about it and get it out to them. Marc is in charge of spreading the word, as well as managing all the behind the scenes processes involved in getting your Symphonica to your front door.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>So that's our project in a nutshell. We absolutely love Symphonica and have been working really hard for a long time to get it out there, and if you've read this far we think you're probably feeling some love for it too. We've done all that we can on our own, but now we need your help to raise the money we need for the first production run. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we've already experienced the greatest challenge a project like this could encounter, the untimely passing away of its inventor and designer during its original crowdfunding campaign. After taking some time to regroup and reorganize we are moving forward again, and having had gone through the worst case scenario we are confident that we can get through any other challenge that could possibly arise.</p>
<p>Getting a product like this from the mind of the designer into the hands of backers involves a great deal of hard work, planning. and coordination between designer, manufacturer and logistics in order to deliver on schedule.</p>
<p>In recognition of this we have worked closely with the production personnel for over a year, refining the specifications and ironing out the technical challenges and complexities involved in transitioning from prototypes and samples to full scale production.</p>
<p>We also have a team member with significant professional experience in handling freight and logistics on a daily basis, and so we are well prepared to deal with the complications that can arise in moving products between the factory, warehouse, and the end user.</p>
<p>As a result of this we are confident that once our goal is met we will be able to deliver on schedule to all our backers.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Exquisite design. Exceptional acoustic engineering. A work of art.
Symphonica is a totally acoustic horn speaker that boosts and enhances the sound from your phone without using electronics. Engineers at major phone companies like Apple and Samsung have created audio systems in their flagship model phones that produce very high quality audio. However there is only so much they can do within the limited internal space of your phone, and so Symphonica channels this high quality audio through its specially designed, patented acoustic chamber, where it is equalized and amplified and emerges with added body, warmth, and tone that fills your personal listening space with an expansive sound field of music with high clarity and a full dynamic range. 
Symphonica's smooth, balanced sound provides the perfect environment for concentration, meditation, relaxation, or for drifting off to a peaceful and restful sleep.Symphonica brings beauty, grace and warmth back to a world dominated by flat and unfeeling plastic iPhone and Android accessories. Its inspired, passionate design reminds that form can be just as valuable as function, capturing the attention and drawing the eye to the flowing, organic patterns expressed in the natural wood grain. Symphonica breaks the mold of boring utilitarian accessories and instead makes a bold statement about uniting the elements of art, fashion, and function all together in one outstanding product.Graceful Curves, Flowing Lines, the Alluring Beauty of Natural Wood
An Inspired Fusion of Art and Science
Designed by a veteran audio engineer with decades of experience creating high end audio products and constructed from environmentally friendly woods, Symphonica needs no electricity yet boosts the sound from your iPhone speaker by more than 6db, filling the room by acoustically amplifying its sound. Symphonica also enhances the sound, adding the body and warmth that you've been missing.
Symphonica is made from sustainably harvested hardwoods and wastes no electricity, making it the greenest, most environmentally-friendly way to display, charge, and amplify your smartphone,
What about those small Bluetooth Speakers? Why would I want a Symphonica instead?
Bluetooth speakers are convenient, but not only do they look unremarkable, they mostly sound unremarkable as well. They force you to make a big compromise in sound quality, as Bluetooth transmission compresses the audio and reduces its dynamic range and fidelity, and then the typical speakers play it back using fairly low quality electronics, introducing artifacts, noise, and distortion before finally smothering it all with a layer of artificially inflated bass - poorly implemented Bluetooth is a mess. And even if you buy expensive ones that reproduce the audio more faithfully you're still up against the inherent limitations of the technology with regards to your lost dynamic range.
Now, if you're mostly blasting Miley Cyrus tracks for partying friends you'll hardly notice. But if you appreciate listening more quietly to the more subtle nuances of acoustic instruments, pure and intimate vocals that put you in the same room as the artist, and the incredible dynamics of classical music with all the swells and crescendos and diminuendos that convey so much feeling and emotional impact, then Bluetooth is robbing you of more than you realize. It's taking what was intended to be an active experience where you are stirred and inspired by virtuoso performers at the height of their musical prowess, and converting it into the technological equivalent of elevator Muzak - bland background imitation that uses your nostalgic memories to distract you from how inadequate the sound is right now. 
With Symphonica what you get out of it is as pure as what goes into it. There is no added electronic noise, distortion, hiss, dropout, or artifacts that come from the use of Bluetooth or low end electronic speakers, just the sweet sound of your favorite performances.

 
Your own Elegantly Sculpted Work of Art
Symphonica's elegant appearance and graceful flowing lines make it a welcome addition to any home or office, and a conversation starter the second your visitors lay their eyes on it. Not only does the natural wood grain each speaker its own individual fingerprint, each is hand sanded, finished and polished to the satisfaction of a craftsman, making it your own unique art sculpture that adds character and charm to any room you place it in.
Symphonica adds unmatched Elegance, Character and Style - no matter where in your house you place it!
Absolutely everyone we've shown Symphonica to has fallen in love with it, wanted to touch it, hold it, and has asked when and where they could get one either for themselves or as a gift for someone else - and we know that you will love it too!

After taking some time to regroup and reorganize we are moving forward again, and having had gone through the worst case scenario we are confident that we can get through any other challenge that could possibly arise.
Getting a product like this from the mind of the designer into the hands of backers involves a great deal of hard work, planning. and coordination between designer, manufacturer and logistics in order to deliver on schedule.
In recognition of this we have worked closely with the production personnel for over a year, refining the specifications and ironing out the technical challenges and complexities involved in transitioning from prototypes and samples to full scale production.
We also have a team member with significant professional experience in handling freight and logistics on a daily basis, and so we are well prepared to deal with the complications that can arise in moving products between the factory, warehouse, and the end user.
As a result of this we are confident that once our goal is met we will be able to deliver on schedule to all our backers.

<p>My name is Mette Damiri, I'm 26, and I am a singer/songwriter from Denmark. I currently live in Rome, Italy, where I'm doing a masters degree in Arts and Culture Management at Rome Business School. In between exams, I write songs and play concerts at various venues in Rome. I've been working on this album for the last 4 years and I can't wait to start recording!</p>
<p>For the first time, people will see the real me behind all the glitter and sound effects of my previous released singles. This album is about love, struggles, and the journey we all have to go through in life.</p>

<p>I've had a difficult childhood. I was at the bottom of the food chain through all my school years. I moved out when I was 15, I had a full time job, and lived on my own. I've had many personal struggles in my young years, but they have made me the woman I am today. This is what this album will reflect. For the first time, I have the courage to just be me, and to let people see me. The genre and sound of the album are inspired by some of my greatest idols such as: Norah Jones, Katie Melua, Dolly Parton, and Bonnie Raitt.</p>
<p><strong>I wrote this song ""Stop Pretending"" in 2012. This is a live recording of the song. The song will be featured on the album and I can't wait to start recording it! </strong></p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Many endeavors start as a dream.  And so it was for ElectroPhonic’s founder Joe Floyd, who one night had a vivid dream in which he was playing an electric guitar with a fantastic soaring sound <i>coming from the guitar itself</i> with no amp or effects pedals.  This “dream guitar” had the lush harmonics and singing tone of an electric guitar, but with all the freedom of an acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Determined to make this vision a reality, Joe built and tested the first prototype.  He then joined forces with Jan Lucas and together they developed several more refined prototypes.  Soon Andy came into the mix and solidified the EP development team.  After many more months of painstaking R and D, the ElectroPhonic™ Model One was born.</p>
<p>There have been previous attempts to set the guitarist free, but ElectroPhonic’s groundbreaking guitar takes things a whole step further, bringing everything together in a professional, simple-to-use, great sounding guitar.</p>
<p>The ElectroPhonic™ team considers their innovative guitar to be an evolution of the art, worthy of a place alongside traditional electric and acoustic guitars.  The hardwood body of an EP guitar is also it’s “tone cabinet,” and as such, the guitar combines elements of electric <i>and </i>acoustic guitars.  EP has combined modern technology and design with traditional electric guitar sensibilities to bring every lover of high-quality, eminently playable guitars something new and exciting to unleash their creativity.  The first instrument is called the Model One EP, and as the name suggests, this is just the beginning of a new generation of electric guitars.</p>
</div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Introducing the Model One EP</h2>
<p>The Model One EP is the world's first self-amplified electric guitar using patented acoustic tuned labyrinth technology for an incredible playing experience.</p>
<p>This revolutionary electric guitar features ElectroPhonic technology and has an analog FET pre-amp, studio-quality effects, a 16-watt stereo power amp, and a dual speaker system. All electronics are powered by our state-of-the-art rechargeable Li-Ion smart power system.  </p>
<p>Also included is EP Link™ which allows players to connect their Model One EP to a Smart Phone and interface with the many guitar applications available.  And, the best part is that there are no cables, outboard effects or amp needed!</p>
<p>You now have freedom - hanging out at the beach, in the park, by a campfire, at an outdoor festival or wherever you want to go.  On stage, on a mountain top, or kicking back in your favorite chair, you will be inspired to play.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>All About TONE</h2>
<p>Analog electronics, dual paper-cone speakers, and dual 8 watt Class D power amp create an immersive sound field. Turn up the gain control and feel the rich harmonics— like a great tube amp.  High quality reverb and chorus effects with simple controls.  You have amazing expressive range at your fingertips. From warm clean tones to mild overdrive to crunch, to full metal shred. It's all there.</p>

If you like the music consider supporting the project by pre-ordering the album.</p>
<p>There are many talented young people across the world without the tools and platform to get their talents heard and realised. I hope our chance meeting can turn into a lasting partnership with this in mind!</p>
<p>150 pre-orders will give us what we need to start recording.</p>
<p>250+ pre-orders and we'll complete the record and make a dent into production costs.

<h2><strong>WHY TUTTI MATTI?</strong></h2>
<p>A question many of you are probably asking yourselves? <strong>What is Tutti Matti</strong> and why do I want what they have? Well let's tell you about the name first! <strong>Tutti Matti is an Italian word</strong>. Tutti means all together or in orchestral music, we all play together. <strong>Matti means mad or crazy, combine the two, and we all play (or party) crazy together! </strong></p>
<p>The next part of the question is <strong>why do you want to support us</strong>? Though our company has a small team, we are a company that is<i> for the people by the people</i>. We do not have big corporations backing us plotting our next move, so when you speak to us, you are connected directly to one of four members of Tutti Studio team. We are committed to keeping us small so we have little red tape to go through when making product changes. </p>
<p>The next part...the most important, what are you supporting?!?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525319964/vsukzboxdjwrxxrusizv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We are Tutti Studio, our 1st product in the road map is Tutti Matti speaker </strong>(pictured above) which is what you are supporting. <strong>This is not just an ordinary wireless speaker</strong>, it is far more than that. <strong>Tutti Matti is the entry way into an audio company that specializes in connecting people as much as we specialize in connecting wireless  speakers</strong>. There are hundreds of speakers on the market that are wireless, durable, portable, and loud. Some have the ability to connect to others, however, I assure you, <strong>you will not find one that connects to 20 speaker units without latency</strong> ! We are solving the issue of portability, connect-ability, durability, and quality all wrapped into one...or 20. <strong>Our goal is to make Tutti Matti a staple of social interactions.</strong> We want everyone to have Tutti Matti the same way they have a phone. Having a get-together or event? <strong>Tell everyone to bring their Tutti Matti's and link them up for some of the best quality sound immersion you will ever hear outside of a concert, on the sands of a beach, the desert, the snow, or way into the mountains! </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Tutti Speakers play loud, clear, have a category leading bass performance, and provide  unique features. </strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">They are created by dancers for dancers and those who live their life through music. Essentially, those who love music and want to party on the go!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>SOUND TUNING</strong></h2>
<p>Most speakers built by reputable brands sound pretty good when you're sitting right beside them. But how about when you are 20 feet away, on a patio, with ten people talking? Good luck.</p>
<p>Since we were tuning the Tutti Matti specifically for partying, <strong>we prioritized ""sound quality at a distance"".</strong> You'll hear details in the music, at a distance, during a party.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525709753/a7fnyqk4a5n7uct9n8le.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>360° DSP</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>These speakers are all controlled by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) that makes sure <strong>each speaker is getting the right information to play to its strengths, creating a full range of uncompromising clarity, even at full party volume</strong>. <strong>One set leans more to the high frequencies, another rolls off a bit lower more focused on the midrange, and then there’s a larger speaker that’s focused on creating sweet, sweet, low lows.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Using <b>our top-notch acoustic reflection algorithm</b>, a single speaker can reproduce a 3D surround effect...</p>
<p>There are <strong>three different speaker driver designs in this five speaker configuration,</strong> making every spot the Sweet Spot.</p>

WHY TUTTI MATTI?
A question many of you are probably asking yourselves? What is Tutti Matti and why do I want what they have? Well let's tell you about the name first! Tutti Matti is an Italian word. Tutti means all together or in orchestral music, we all play together. Matti means mad or crazy, combine the two, and we all play (or party) crazy together! 
The next part of the question is why do you want to support us? Though our company has a small team, we are a company that is for the people by the people. We do not have big corporations backing us plotting our next move, so when you speak to us, you are connected directly to one of four members of Tutti Studio team. We are committed to keeping us small so we have little red tape to go through when making product changes. 
The next part...the most important, what are you supporting?!?!
 

 
We are Tutti Studio, our 1st product in the road map is Tutti Matti speaker (pictured above) which is what you are supporting. This is not just an ordinary wireless speaker, it is far more than that. Tutti Matti is the entry way into an audio company that specializes in connecting people as much as we specialize in connecting wireless  speakers. There are hundreds of speakers on the market that are wireless, durable, portable, and loud. Some have the ability to connect to others, however, I assure you, you will not find one that connects to 20 speaker units without latency ! We are solving the issue of portability, connect-ability, durability, and quality all wrapped into one...or 20. Our goal is to make Tutti Matti a staple of social interactions. We want everyone to have Tutti Matti the same way they have a phone. Having a get-together or event? Tell everyone to bring their Tutti Matti's and link them up for some of the best quality sound immersion you will ever hear outside of a concert, on the sands of a beach, the desert, the snow, or way into the mountains! 

Tutti Speakers play loud, clear, have a category leading bass performance, and provide  unique features. 
They are created by dancers for dancers and those who live their life through music. Essentially, those who love music and want to party on the go!

 
Key Features
 

 
SOUND TUNING
Most speakers built by reputable brands sound pretty good when you're sitting right beside them. But how about when you are 20 feet away, on a patio, with ten people talking? Good luck.
Since we were tuning the Tutti Matti specifically for partying, we prioritized ""sound quality at a distance"". You'll hear details in the music, at a distance, during a party.
 

360° DSP
 
These speakers are all controlled by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) that makes sure each speaker is getting the right information to play to its strengths, creating a full range of uncompromising clarity, even at full party volume. One set leans more to the high frequencies, another rolls off a bit lower more focused on the midrange, and then there’s a larger speaker that’s focused on creating sweet, sweet, low lows.
 

 
Using our top-notch acoustic reflection algorithm, a single speaker can reproduce a 3D surround effect...
There are three different speaker driver designs in this five speaker configuration, making every spot the Sweet Spot.

 
 
Channel Splitting
With a simple user interface, users can orient speakers however they'd like. Adjust to left, right, or center on each speaker to create the most immersive sound experience possible.


Product Description
The tutti matting is the only speaker that can start, sustain, and close a party. One is enough to keep things bumping. Two+ is next level. Use the microphone to MC the party or get some karaoke shenanigans going. With two or more use the liquid dance floor feature to create your ideal acoustic experience. Synchronize up to eight units with the touch of a button to enlarge your acoustic footprint, or to create a single accurate, and uninterrupted sound-field. Bluetooth gets you in wireless with your favorite party jams, from any source. Wireless use gets you 10 hours of jams, plug it in for permanent party duty.
 

 
Liquid Sound  Dimensions
“A portable Sound Dimensions, defined by sound”. This was the inspiration, and starting point that led to the Matti, and the Liquid Sound  Dimensions feature.
With the simple flick of a switch, you can set a group of Matti speakers to perform Left, Center, Right, duties. The effect this creates is a completely immersive sound-field. You are literally “inside the music”, if anything will make you want to get your groove on, it’s The Liquid Sound Dimensions.

 
One Button for connecting Master and Slaves Instantly
This is all accomplished through Bluetooth to the Master device, and that is it! No apps, no other software. Just connect to any device capable of pairing via Bluetooth and you're set!
How do you connect them? Simple press the pair button on the top of the ""Master"" Tutti Matti speaker and it immediately links by our proprietary PartyNet protocol  to the rest of the speakers within a second.
 

 

No Latency among all the devices
Proprietary Party Net Protocol, Sync up to 20 speakers.
PartyNet seamlessly connects up to 20 Matti speakers with zero latency. As people arrive with their Matti’s, the party grows in size and sound. The best part is that all your friends can bring their Tutti Matti's to connect with yours!  There is absolutely no restrictions in pairing, you can mix and match however you please!
 

 
 
 
Pre-AMP for MIC
Want voice control? You got it! We can even provide you with a Mic, whether it be through karaoke, emcee, or DJing a party. You are in control and you are the voice of the party!
With the touch of a single button, your voice will emerge in all it’s glory, from all the speakers, wirelessly, in perfect unison.

 
 
Tripod Hole

 
 
Partying requires a seriously reliable speaker. Everything about Tutti Matti was engineered to party hard. Steel grills, aluminum handle, extra thick molded polymer sub-chassis, and a thick silicone rubber bumper. 

 
 
AND YES, IT'S GOT A BIG, FAT BATTERY... 
You get 10+ hours of party level sound with just one full charge. Each full charge take less than 1 hour! Party's still on everyone!

WORD ON THE STREET
We have been hardening our concept all over the world.

What We Need & What You Get

Tutti Studio's Commitment
We are committed to our customers, so much so that we were fully funded (doubling the goal) on a previous campaign, but willingly refunded all of our customers. Why? Well, we had recently figured out new ways to improve the product and felt that it would be dishonest on our first release to sell units that were inferior to their predecessor. So, we refunded everyone and here we are again, with a new release of our upgraded product! This is how committed we are!


Risks & Challenges
Risks, well we are entering one of the more saturated markets out there! With sound giants like Beats by Dre, JBL, or Bose, we are competing with a lot of mega corporations. But why will we succeed? In our books, we already have succeeded. We have already created the product, tested the product, and shared the product. People love it! We have not met another company that offers the same ability or the same quality that our Tutti Matti speakers have. Better yet, we have not yet met an audio company with the same transparency and dedication to customer satisfaction that we provide. As mentioned before, we already refunded an entire campaign simply because we wanted those people to have a fair shot at an improved product at a cheaper rate! That was a huge risk in itself! Like most start-up companies, we are challenged with manufacturing and shipping cost. With your help we believe we can truly improve the product and provide one that each person in this world can all be proud of!

We are Yannick and Erik — BLOMM &amp; BERGER.</p><p>We designed and developed a high quality, bluetooth headphone. We set our focus on sound quality and functionality to make something special for the community. That is why we chose to work with high quality material and a few essential functions which are explained below.</p><p><strong>Why did we create this product? </strong><br/></p><p>We wanted to create a lifestyle product which benefits from a great sound system and a list of functions which improve sound experience.

We are Yannick and Erik — BLOMM & BERGER.We designed and developed a high quality, bluetooth headphone. We set our focus on sound quality and functionality to make something special for the community. That is why we chose to work with high quality material and a few essential functions which are explained below.Why did we create this product? We wanted to create a lifestyle product which benefits from a great sound system and a list of functions which improve sound experience. One of the functions is the smart on/off function, which allows you to pause and get right back to the music. It was also our goal to create a headphone which can be adjusted to any situation so music can be enjoyed through on-ear and around-ear earpads. A lot of people buy on-ear headphones because they are not so big, will then although miss the great sound around-ear earpads achieve. So why not have both?


SMART ON/OFF FUNCTION - MUSIC PAUSES AUTOMATICALLYThis function allows you to take off the headphone in the middle of a song when meeting friends or family. The music automatically turns off and starts playing again when put on. With this function you can pause and then get right back to the music.SWITCH EARPADSThere are no hard decisions whether to buy an on-ear (headphone cushion on ears) or over-ear (headphone cushion fully surrounding ears) headphone. With our flexible switch system you can change earpads and adjust to a studio situation. Feel free to switch whenever you want.PERSONALIZETo make the headphone yours. You can brand it with your own name. Any font can be engraved into the silicone patch. If you are interested in buying the headphone with a personalization we will contact you for further information regarding the design. SOUND AND MATERIALBesides functionality we also set our focus on sound quality and material. We decided to analyze the best leading headphones and optimize our system to get the best sound possible. We are very happy with the result. Besides this we knew from the start that we did not want to create a standard product. That is why we started mixing materials such as metal and oil finished rubber plastic to achieve a smooth and valuable feeling.CONTROLSFor quick and easy handling we installed invisible control points. Why invisible? To keep the design simple.- To PAUSE and PLAY a song press the middle.- To go to the next song press forward (right side). To go back a song press back (left side).- To increase or decrease the volume, simply press up or down.First SketchesFirst RendersChoice of materialTimelineTeam«We are very happy with the result.
