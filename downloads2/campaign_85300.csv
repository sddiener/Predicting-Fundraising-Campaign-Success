<h3>IT'S TIME!!!</h3>
<p>We've been out performing hundreds of live shows around the Pacific Northwest, but now after a few years we're finally making time to get back in the studio. We're going to record a few fan-favourite songs, including 'Mexico', 'Kumbaya Supernova', 'Madman', a couple of new tunes, and more! We enjoy folks singing along to these songs at shows, but it's time we made them available for you to take home also.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Have: Songs and Musicians</h3>
<p>Phil Hirschi (cello), Oliver Dye (drums), Mary Ann Miller (vocals), Cory Cavazos (bass), Saint John (guitar, vocals), plus many special guests including some internationally known stars and some of our super-talented friends from the Seattle music scene. This album is going to be pretty rad. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need: Studio Time and Manufacturing</h3>
<p>This is the part where we need funding to get this record made, we'll be recording and creating copies as economically as we can, but studio time and engineers still need to be paid. Your help will ensure that we can get the musicians and songs into the studio and then copies of them out into the world and into your ears. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>Music is still made because of folks like you, without your contribution we wouldn't be able to make this record. Please share this campaign if you have some like-minded friends that might also want to be a part of it. Thank you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much love,</p>

Growing up in a small town in Maine, Amy Arsenault and Bethany Perkins both discovered their passion for the ARTS at a very young age. Amy was always attracted to all things colorful, was inspired by the beauty of nature that surrounded her, and the smell of a brand new box of oil pastels.  Bethany grew up in a musical household, as her parents were both musicians and teachers of music.  With her talented mom by her side, Bethany began playing the piano at 4 years old.  Amy and Bethany grew up with the famous Cumston Hall down the road, home of the Shakepearean Theater of Monmouth, where both performed in plays throughout their childhood. </p>
<p>Not only are Amy and Bethany passionate about creating their art, but they are driven to share their gift to others of all ages and abilities. Both believe in the rejuvenating qualities of the arts.  Art and Music are deeply connected to feeling and meaning, and when expressed, they have the ability to open up the mind to the joys of the human spirit. Marc Chagall said it well, ""Color is everything, Color is vibration like music; Everything is vibration.""  Their goal with COLORS Creative Arts, is to create a community through creativity; one they certainly would have thrived in growing up.  COLORS is a space where classes can be held inside or outside, and is nestled by Portland's Back Cove, a perfect location for inspiration and connecting with nature within this small city. Now we are also offering massage therapy!</p>
<p>With help from contributors to our campaign, we will be able to get a head start financially.  Offering sessions in music, visual arts, yoga, massage, and dance, there is something for almost everyone who wants to open their minds to creativity. With a successful campaign, we will be able to provide an exciting, creative environment to everyone who enters our studio.  We are thankful to have the sunshine of happy energy and talents from Nicole Mokeme, who assists in art classes, hosts events for teens, and teaches creative movement classes.  Also, the positive and peaceful yoga teacher, Hayley Brennan, will soon be offering classes in yoga, meditation, and mindfulness. Kirk Underwood will be our resident massage therapist. Our dream of creating a creative community has already started, but with a little financial help we will be able to offer the best Arts programming possible.</p>

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Thanks for your interest in my project! In short, I am recording and releasing a limited-run tape cassette and digital download ep of new material, titled ""Summer Flight (Lasts Forever)"".  To help fund a trip to teach, learn, and guide workshops in remote northern schools, and record new work and perform in the Northern Yukon, I am offering advance sales of the cassette, which will be delivered with digital download codes of the recordings, as well as other goodies, for contributors to this campaign. The remainder of the tapes will be for sale on my cross-Canadian tour.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>This winter, I am embarking on a Canadian tour, ending with a trip to the Yukon Territory. While in the Yukon, I will be doing artist talks as well as collaborative songwriting workshops with students at Chief Zzeh Gittlit School In Old Crow, and Robert Service Secondary in Dawson City. Chief Zzeh Gittlit School is the furthest north of Yukon schools. It is located in Old Crow, the home of the Vuntut Gwich’in, which is the only fly-in community in the Yukon. Old Crow is located north of the Arctic Circle on the bank of the Porcupine River near the junction of the Old Crow River and the Porcupine. Robert Service is located in Dawson City, on the traditional Territory of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in. I am privileged to be an invited guest of these communities, and I travel there with humility, gratitude, and an enthusiasm to learn, in turn, from the students and their communities.</p>
<p>Following this trip to the subarctic, I will be returning to Whitehorse to record new material with my friend and esteemed producer, Jordy Walker. Joining me will be my close collaborator, Liam Cole. The three of us will be collaborating on new recorded work with Yukon-based artists.</p>
<p>Specifically for this tour, I am releasing a limited-run tape cassette featuring three songs:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extended version of a new arrangement for my song ""<i>Summer Fight</i>s"". Another full-band version will appear on my forthcoming album 'The Winter of our Discotheque'.</li>
<li>An alternative version of my forthcoming single ""Candy Store"", in its original folk-orientated form.</li>
<li>A brand new song ""Saint Maybe (Quid Pro Quo)"". An alternative, full-band version of this will be recorded by producer Jordy Walker while I am in Whitehorse.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Subarctic is very far away and quite complicated to get to from Ontario. I am recording and releasing this limited-run cassette in an effort to help fund this month-long experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I am raising $4,500 to contribute to some of the costs associated with this trip and the production of this tape. Contributors will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>A numbered copy (1-150) of the limited release cassette, featuring original artwork by a very special visual artist TBA</li>
<li>A digital download code for the cassette</li>
<li>A digital download code for my forthcoming single ""Candy Store"", via Bandcamp.</li>
<li>A letter, handwritten in the Yukon, on the back of a print of original artwork by a very special TBA visual artist.</li>
<li>A ""Summer Fights Last Forever"" button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional tapes not purchased through this campaign will be available for sale at my performances in the Yukon, and a further run of copies will be given to students and families at the school for free. If the campaign covers the costs of the trip and production, the remainder of the funds will be donated to the schools.</p>
</div><p> </p><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help. I would love for this campaign to be shared far and wide. Feel free to share on social media channels, and tag me! @michaelcduguay</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">B</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">eginning operations in 1998, The Joy of Music School is a local, nonprofit organization that provides an enriched music education for disadvantaged, at-risk children in the Knoxville community and surrounding area. In the hopes of broadening opportunities, free music lessons taught by volunteers and free musical instruments are offered. It is this organization’s goal to encourage and support each child to reach their highest potential on and off the stage.  </span><br/> <p><strong>What We Need</strong></p> <p>According to City-data.com, the median household income in Knoxville is $13,000 below the Tennessee state median. This creates a large amount of potentially at-risk children who may not have access to the same privileges as others, such as music education.</p> <p>In order for these young children to learn and gain further musical skills and techniques, The School needs to raise funds to replace the broken, worn down instrument strings.</p> <p>Any sign of support would be greatly appreciated by The School and the artistic students.</p> <p><strong>Impact on Community</strong></p> <p>The Joy of Music School teaches and motivates more than 200 local, disadvantaged children at their on-site location. In addition to those students though, The School also motivates and supports another 700 to 1,000 children enrolled in outreach programs such as The Emerald Youth Foundation, Boys &amp; Girls Club, and The Urban Family Outreach. Volunteer teachers provide group music classes to these after-school sites with the goal of inspiring them artistically and developing their skills musically.  </p>

Beginning operations in 1998, The Joy of Music School is a local, nonprofit organization that provides an enriched music education for disadvantaged, at-risk children in the Knoxville community and surrounding area. In the hopes of broadening opportunities, free music lessons taught by volunteers and free musical instruments are offered. It is this organization’s goal to encourage and support each child to reach their highest potential on and off the stage.   What We Need According to City-data.com, the median household income in Knoxville is $13,000 below the Tennessee state median. This creates a large amount of potentially at-risk children who may not have access to the same privileges as others, such as music education. In order for these young children to learn and gain further musical skills and techniques, The School needs to raise funds to replace the broken, worn down instrument strings. Any sign of support would be greatly appreciated by The School and the artistic students. Impact on Community The Joy of Music School teaches and motivates more than 200 local, disadvantaged children at their on-site location. In addition to those students though, The School also motivates and supports another 700 to 1,000 children enrolled in outreach programs such as The Emerald Youth Foundation, Boys & Girls Club, and The Urban Family Outreach. Volunteer teachers provide group music classes to these after-school sites with the goal of inspiring them artistically and developing their skills musically.  
 
Success Story Though every student at The Joy of Music School gain additional musical opportunities that they would not have had before, Taber Gable was a child who stood out. To read about Taber Gable’s journey in becoming a Jazz Graduate Student at Juilliard School, click on the following link: https://joyofmusicschool.wordpress.com/2014/05/... Hear From The Staff and Students: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTp1ixHpinhy0W...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Records are costly affairs.  They're also big investments.  The challenge for independent artists like ourselves is the investment.  When a record costs $2500 to make (which, is on the exceptionally cheap side), an artist is expected that can pay that out of pocket until they can recoup costs in sales, which can take quite a while.  It's our hope that with your help, we can offset the time-line a little bit, and recoup some of the costs before the record officially goes on sale.  Please notice that we are not asking for our supporters to cover all our costs.  We're hoping that through album pre-sales and sponsorships we can cover the cost of manufacturing.  We know the rest is our responsibility.</div>

<p>Firstly, I have to say I love all of you so much for visiting this page!</p>
<p>I am in great need of some funds to in order to release my debut CD. The songs have been recorded, mixed and the CD release party has been booked. I need money for CD pressing, mastering, artwork and if I have money left over I will use it for promotion. Exciting, no?!!!! </p>
<p>Let me tell you a little about myself…</p>
<p class=""Report"">I am a songwriter and multi-instrumental folk musician from Ottawa, Ontario. On stage I go by the name Erin Saoirse Adair, which reflects my Irish and Scots heritage and the influence of these folkloric traditions in my music (and my extensive and formative travels in Celtic Western Europe); my music and lyrics are therefore an extension of not only my ancestry but also my travels and life experiences. As an artist I strive to see beauty in ugly situations. My work focuses on polyphony (in the general sense) through the complexity of experience in the Canadian urban setting. Through my lyrical narratives I explore notions of brokenness, loss of place (and rediscovering a sense of it), and despair, especially via the tropes of urban decay, youthful alienation, addiction, and poverty. I offer many of my own experiences; having been at times homeless, suicidal, abused and abusive, and after an arduous struggle with addiction, my own stories add strength to my chosen themes. I am inspired by the suffering and redemption described by poets such as Seamus Heaney, Leonard Cohen, and Sylvia Plath. With these guides, I pursue my art in order to lend without shame my stories to the polyphony that surrounds me.</p>
<p class=""Report"">With the help of a creation grant from Canada Council for the Arts, over the past year I have been earnestly writing, polishing, and performing new songs and with the help of funding from Ontario Arts Council and the City of Ottawa I have been able to record these songs, hire session musicians, and finish the mixing process. I have spent all of my money trying to create music that is to my liking. I need your help to fund the mastering and pressing of my CD! Without your help, my music will be held hostage by my computer and will never be free in the physical world!</p>
<p class=""Report"">You can sample my recordings (so far) by visting my (kinda crappy, I need money for that too) website at <a href=""http://www.erinsaoirseadair.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.erinsaoirseadair.com</a>. If you send me an email, I can send you an mp3 file of my new single ""Drunken Cliche"" or ""No Confusion"" so you can put it on your iPod before the CD release!

Words can't express what that means to us and we hope that you'll be a part of what God is doing (and will do) through our music. </p><p>In creating the Like The Wind project we (Ben and Leah) are making a decision to take the leap of faith that has beckoned us for nearly five years of our lives and ministry. It's by your support and the grace and provision of Jesus that we'll be able to step out onto the waves and make an acoustic, organic, inspired, Spirit-led piece of musical and visual art (made up of four original worship songs) which thoroughly represents our heart and the type of worship movement we'd be honored to carry and share across the world. Having said that, we could make all sorts of grand gestures about the future but the truth is this: we don't have everything mapped out, nor do we have it all together. We are simply following where the Spirit takes us, one step at a time. For us, this is that ""next step"".  No matter what is to come, our hearts are to see the Kingdom of God invade earth, and not just from the sidelines. We want it to be up-close and personal. Not merely Jesus living in us but <i>us, living in Jesus.</i></p><p>This live worship EP is the genesis of a grand adventure... Join hands with us as we walk in the fullness of Jesus and see where we end up!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The amount we are trying to raise may seem outrageous to some, but we truly desire to make something beautiful, worthwhile, extraordinary. Not only that but we want to be able to take care of the musicians, videographers, photographers, technicians, engineers and everyone who has a hand in this project. We want you to feel comfortable and at ease, knowing that your hard-earned dollar is going toward artwork made with integrity and excellence. Here is a list of the costs that go into creating this type of product (and please keep in mind that even with this seemingly large budget we have been blessed with amazing deals and cost breaks, thanks to Jesus and some really generous, talented folks!) (Yeah, it's <i>that </i>expensive to make a good project!) (Sick, we know.):</p><ul>
<li>Videography - $2,000</li>
<li>Recording (Studio/Musicians/Audio Engineer/Mastering) - $3,000</li>
<li>Artwork/Photography - $2,000</li>
<li>CD's (hard copies) - $1,000</li>
<li>Marketing - $1,000</li>
<li>Misc. (emergencies, oversights, etc.) - $1,000</li>
</ul><p>Remember that every penny makes an impact! Also, check out our perks and prizes. We appreciate your gift so much and we want to sweeten the deal as much as possible! And no matter your ability to support at this time (whether it be a lot, a little, or none at all) the fact that you've taken the time to look over this page means the world to us. Please pray for us and keep up with what we're doing-- your spiritual partnership is of the utmost importance! </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where We're Going &amp; How You're Helping</h3><p>As we said before, we're not interested in talking a big game or making crazy plans to further ourselves. As a young married couple and new parents we feel that we are at the most beautiful crossroad in life; we have the unique opportunity to forsake the striving that this world impresses upon us and leave behind the harsh taskmaster that is the ""American Dream"" and instead live out the call of Jesus, as commanded in Matthew 28:16-20. We want our hearts to be singularly focused on serving God. We want our child(ren) to be raised up seeing Jesus move in power, inside and outside of the four walls of ""church"". We've tried the approach of asking God to bless us where we are... and He is so good, so faithful and He does <i>work all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purposes </i>(Romans 8:28) and we are beyond grateful for that! However, what we desire more than anything is to forget about what we have planned--what we could dream up--because we have confidence in the promise that what He has <i>is just better. </i></p><p>We have nothing holding us back. Nothing separating us from walking in His perfect will! How exciting!</p><p>We understand that not everyone is in this season, has this opportunity, etc. which is why we would love for you to be a part of our team and support what Jesus is doing in our lives. We want you to be our partners, our prayer covering, our family, and for you to feel equally blessed by the partnership. Please consider what your role in this ministry can be!</p><p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Thank you for placing people along our path who are filled with the desire to give their time, efforts and financial gifts toward the furthering of Your Glory! We long to see revival, however that looks. In our own spirits, in our churches, in our nations. Help us to make Your reality our reality! God, we ask with our whole hearts that you would invade our lives, turn our world upside down, help us to cast aside our yearning for the satisfactions of this earth. Let us fix our eyes on You! Maker, Creator, King, Author, Lover of our Souls. We are no longer interested in seeing You join us, but rather in us joining You! Thank you for allowing us to see You and to worship You fully, in spirit and in truth.

Presh. &lt;3 (&lt;-- *That was Leah.)</p><p><br/></p><p>;) (&lt;-- *so was that.)</p></div>","Who We Are & What We're DoingHello there!We are thrilled and honestly overwhelmed that you've stopped by and are considering supporting our journey. Words can't express what that means to us and we hope that you'll be a part of what God is doing (and will do) through our music. In creating the Like The Wind project we (Ben and Leah) are making a decision to take the leap of faith that has beckoned us for nearly five years of our lives and ministry. It's by your support and the grace and provision of Jesus that we'll be able to step out onto the waves and make an acoustic, organic, inspired, Spirit-led piece of musical and visual art (made up of four original worship songs) which thoroughly represents our heart and the type of worship movement we'd be honored to carry and share across the world. Having said that, we could make all sorts of grand gestures about the future but the truth is this: we don't have everything mapped out, nor do we have it all together. We are simply following where the Spirit takes us, one step at a time. For us, this is that ""next step"".  No matter what is to come, our hearts are to see the Kingdom of God invade earth, and not just from the sidelines. We want it to be up-close and personal. Not merely Jesus living in us but us, living in Jesus.This live worship EP is the genesis of a grand adventure... Join hands with us as we walk in the fullness of Jesus and see where we end up!What We Need & What You GetThe amount we are trying to raise may seem outrageous to some, but we truly desire to make something beautiful, worthwhile, extraordinary. Not only that but we want to be able to take care of the musicians, videographers, photographers, technicians, engineers and everyone who has a hand in this project. We want you to feel comfortable and at ease, knowing that your hard-earned dollar is going toward artwork made with integrity and excellence. Here is a list of the costs that go into creating this type of product (and please keep in mind that even with this seemingly large budget we have been blessed with amazing deals and cost breaks, thanks to Jesus and some really generous, talented folks!) (Yeah, it's that expensive to make a good project!) (Sick, we know.):
Videography - $2,000
Recording (Studio/Musicians/Audio Engineer/Mastering) - $3,000
Artwork/Photography - $2,000
CD's (hard copies) - $1,000
Marketing - $1,000
Misc. (emergencies, oversights, etc.) - $1,000
Remember that every penny makes an impact! Also, check out our perks and prizes. We appreciate your gift so much and we want to sweeten the deal as much as possible! And no matter your ability to support at this time (whether it be a lot, a little, or none at all) the fact that you've taken the time to look over this page means the world to us. Please pray for us and keep up with what we're doing-- your spiritual partnership is of the utmost importance! Where We're Going & How You're HelpingAs we said before, we're not interested in talking a big game or making crazy plans to further ourselves. As a young married couple and new parents we feel that we are at the most beautiful crossroad in life; we have the unique opportunity to forsake the striving that this world impresses upon us and leave behind the harsh taskmaster that is the ""American Dream"" and instead live out the call of Jesus, as commanded in Matthew 28:16-20. We want our hearts to be singularly focused on serving God. We want our child(ren) to be raised up seeing Jesus move in power, inside and outside of the four walls of ""church"". We've tried the approach of asking God to bless us where we are... and He is so good, so faithful and He does work all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purposes (Romans 8:28) and we are beyond grateful for that! However, what we desire more than anything is to forget about what we have planned--what we could dream up--because we have confidence in the promise that what He has is just better. We have nothing holding us back. Nothing separating us from walking in His perfect will! How exciting!We understand that not everyone is in this season, has this opportunity, etc. which is why we would love for you to be a part of our team and support what Jesus is doing in our lives. We want you to be our partners, our prayer covering, our family, and for you to feel equally blessed by the partnership. Please consider what your role in this ministry can be!Thank you, thank you, thank you! This is our prayer for you:Sweet Savior, bless the hearts behind the computer screens in this very moment. You transcend time and space. You are better than anything we can ask or imagine. Thank you for placing people along our path who are filled with the desire to give their time, efforts and financial gifts toward the furthering of Your Glory!

Then I began traveling around the world to places like Bali, Cambodia, Peru, and singing for kids in schools and orphanages.  I realized people everywhere were thirsty for the kind of positive music that I loved to sing and play.  I started writing songs about being your best, believing in yourself and following your dreams, and this turned into the theme for my first CD.<br/><br/>Why wait 30 years to record my first CD?  I didn't believe I was good enough - thought I had to have it all figured out before I took that first step.  Then 3 years ago, I came to realize there were no guarantees I would ever have it figured out.  So, I took that first step, not knowing where it would lead, but believing I could do it if I just kept working at it.<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>By taking that first step, and holding onto belief that I would be shown the next step, I have recorded 10 of 11 songs for my first CD titled ""If I Believed"".  The title cut is co-written by me, along with my producer and friend Freebo (yep, the great bass player who toured for years with Bonnie Raitt).  </span><br/></p><p></p><h3>About my CD project's path:</h3><p></p><p>I have learned tons, along my recording path, and it has been especially great to find I was a pretty decent singer.  I hired amazing pro artists to make a really high-quality professional CD.  About half the songs are recorded at Addison Studios in the LA area, with the very talented Robert Tepper doing the engineering and mixing, and Freebo adding his expertise to every step of the production.  <br/><br/>Because I also wanted to put a bit of CK signature bluegrass instrumentation into the folk-pop-rock mix, I was led to work with another fantastic studio engineer/producer, <br/>Jim Ratts of Raven Studios (and Runaway Express fame) in the Denver, Colorado area.  Through Jim, I was fortunate to meet, and hire, the top bluegrass instrumentalist in Colorado, the versatile, amazingly talented and humorously humble musical magician , Ernie Martinez.  Ernie plays more instruments than anyone I know, plays each one expertly, and I am honored to have his instruments on several of my songs.<br/><br/>I have incredible singers providing harmony backups, such as Freebo, Daniel Nahmod, Mollie O'Brien, Amy Nugent and Mailyn Faulkner.  I also included my favorite accordian player, John Magnee of The Subdudes fame, which adds a wonderful, unique quality to the sound! </p><p></p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><br/>What YOU get for supporting my CD<br/><br/><ul><li>

<h3>Interlude of My Own Humanity Showing</h3>
<p>Hi! Jen Budd here.  I'll begin by saying I'm nervous - this whole funding campaign is so out of my comfort zone. Normally in a situation like this I would put my head down and do it myself by using my own savings and working ridiculous hours to pay for it myself - which is what I have done with my past recordings and business endeavours. It is because of these investments, which I am so proud and grateful for, that am broke and thought a project like this would be financially impossible.  However, I was encouraged by a close friend of mine (Anne *cough*) to get out of my comfort zone, and trust that the community I surround myself with would, in fact, want to support my next  musical/ministry project. </p>
<p>I am passionate about writing songs and leading praise in the Church.  It may come as a shock to some of you that I haven't recorded a praise album yet.  But the fact of the matter is that I have been avoiding the nudge to record a praise album for the past 7 years.  Blatant disobedience *eye roll*.  Ultimately, my cynicism of Christian music prevented me from listening, trusting and being obedient to God.  I am human and I have sinned, but I have also encountered a Love that has dispelled fear and brought new life. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>So here I go, with my hands up in surrender - hoping that I am on a roller coaster to enjoy a ride, not jumping out of a plane without a parachute. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the EP, ""Humanity, Meet Heaven""</h3>
<p>How do I reconcile the goodness of God in the midst of this problem of pain? What does it mean ""on earth, as it is in Heaven""?   <strong>“Humanity, Meet Heaven”</strong> was birthed out of a place of prayer and solitude, personal struggles and revelations, and seeing a common thread of questions in my community.  I began to write songs that both recognize our humanity – the brokenness and suffering we endure – and also the immense power and love of God that meets humanity where we are at. From that personal time of re-birthed hope, came songs that offer a snippet of God’s nature, freedom, and the celebration of heaven, as it can be on earth.</p>
<p><strong>This EP will be released to the public for FREE </strong>(on all available digital platforms, downloadable chord charts will be available on my website).  My hope is that the EP will be a free gift to my community and the broader Church.  In order to make this reality, this is where a financial partnership with YOU will come into play...</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I resonate deeply with the cry of these songs, and at the same time, I feel a sense of excitement and encouragement of God's goodness revealed.  Considering the current state of our world and our Church, I'm sure there are others who will feel the same. I believe the message that God meeting us in our pain is extremely timely and hopeful for Christians and non-Christians alike.  Immanuel - God with us. </p>

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>When I was a kid, quality music filled my heart and mind with the good news of God's love and goodness. Music shaped my walk with God and I want to bring that to kids of this generation.  Today's kids listen to pop music with an adult sound.  My goal is to create an album that communicates the truth and love of God with lyrics kids can relate to, but for that message to be carried by the vehicle of the modern pop music sound kids love to sing and dance to. God has called me to write great songs for kids and I want to bring those songs to the world in the best way possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Make A Pledge Today</h3>
<p>All rewards come with a gift-able ""Spread the Love"" reward to share with someone you love. So not only are you investing into the lives of countless kids, parents, and families but you also get a little something for yourself, and something to give away.  </p>
<h3>The $$$</h3>
<p>Creating a high-quality album that has the ability to reach the world is VERY expensive. A single song created with high-quality producers, musicians, mixing, and mastering can cost between $2500-$5000. This is one of the benefits to being signed to a record label - they typically cover the large cost of creating a quality record upfront. </p>
<p>I enjoy being an independent artist and that's where crowdfunding comes in. If I can raise the money myself, I can create a quality record while still keeping creative control of my music and career. </p>
<p>So I have two goals. Goal #1 is $15,000. This will cover the cost of having a 5 song EP produced by top-notch kids music producers and musicians. (ACCOMPLISHED!)</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>I am so excited to be working with a team of producers and writers from USA &amp; Canada.  This includes producers and writers who have won Grammy's, Dove Awards, Juno's, created the music for Veggietales, and other international kids projects.  The money donated will be used to work with this quality team that can deliver a product that stands up to anything else in the kids market. </p>

When I was a kid, quality music filled my heart and mind with the good news of God's love and goodness. Music shaped my walk with God and I want to bring that to kids of this generation.  Today's kids listen to pop music with an adult sound.  My goal is to create an album that communicates the truth and love of God with lyrics kids can relate to, but for that message to be carried by the vehicle of the modern pop music sound kids love to sing and dance to. God has called me to write great songs for kids and I want to bring those songs to the world in the best way possible. 

Make A Pledge Today
All rewards come with a gift-able ""Spread the Love"" reward to share with someone you love. So not only are you investing into the lives of countless kids, parents, and families but you also get a little something for yourself, and something to give away.  
The $$$
Creating a high-quality album that has the ability to reach the world is VERY expensive. A single song created with high-quality producers, musicians, mixing, and mastering can cost between $2500-$5000. This is one of the benefits to being signed to a record label - they typically cover the large cost of creating a quality record upfront. 
I enjoy being an independent artist and that's where crowdfunding comes in. If I can raise the money myself, I can create a quality record while still keeping creative control of my music and career. 
So I have two goals. Goal #1 is $15,000. This will cover the cost of having a 5 song EP produced by top-notch kids music producers and musicians. (ACCOMPLISHED!)
Goal #2 is $30,000.  This will cover the cost of have a 10 song full album produced by top notch kids music producers and musicians.  
The Team
I am so excited to be working with a team of producers and writers from USA & Canada.  This includes producers and writers who have won Grammy's, Dove Awards, Juno's, created the music for Veggietales, and other international kids projects.  The money donated will be used to work with this quality team that can deliver a product that stands up to anything else in the kids market. 
The Plan
I am already starting to work with writers and producers to create the album.  I am going to keep writing until I have 10 world class kids songs. After that, all that I need is the finances to get the album produced and send it out into the world! 

Risks & Challenges

The biggest challenge is going to be getting $30,000.

<p>Hey I'm Sam Lawson, and I'm a 23 year old musician from Christchurch, New Zealand. Starting as a concept to self record and produce a 4 track EP over a week in summer, the initial idea quickly grew into something much bigger! I now have 4 tracks recorded and mixed, but as I started with no budget, am already well in debt for this project, and need help to get it over the finish line! If you can support this project, you will be helping me see this through to completion!</p>
<p>As I've said, I need help to finish this off, and that's where you come in! What I've decided to do, is presale the EP on indiegogo in order to raise the funds to print the albums. In essence, I don't care if I don't make any profit on this (it was never about that) but I'd love for people to be able to hear this. So selling it this way lets me pay for the production and know how many copies are required. Any money raised above and beyond the goal can be put into printing extra copies that I can try to sell in the future.</p>
<p>To break down the figures, I need:<br/><br/>$750 for mastering the mixed files</p>
<p>$1500 for printing CD's and packaging</p>
<p>$500 for design work<br/><br/>So in order to raise that I have a range of options available for sale, including digital and physical copies.</p>
<p>If you can't fund this project, you can still help! Share this project with your friends on facebook, and go like (and share) my facebook page, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/samlawsonmusicnz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/samlawsonmusicnz/</a> to stay up to date with future projects!<br/><br/>If nothing else, thanks for giving me the time it took to read this far!<br/><br/>Sam :)</p>

<p>Hey friend! My name is Jeremy Strand. I currently live in the Denver area where I serve as a Pastor at a local church that has a rich history and an exciting destiny. </p>
<p><strong>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p>Music, with the variation of many genres, has been a deep love of mine ever since childhood.  I started learning guitar on my own at 16 and as soon as a few chords were played I began to write some of my own songs. A couple of inspirations of mine would include artists such as Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Barefoot Truth, as well as Christian artists like Rich Mullins or Shawn McDonald.</p>
<p><strong>WHATS THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>This music project is about making an EP without having to go through the conventional means of the music world by being signed by a label. With the EP, we plan to 'get out there' by playing shows in various places with a product we can offer to fans.</p>
<p><u>Because we're going this route of creating an EP, it takes the financial support of friends like you to make this vision become a reality!</u></p>
<p><strong>THE BREAKDOWN &amp; THE PERKS</strong></p>
<p><u>In order to create a record-quality EP, we need $4,500.</u> Once the EP is complete, we will be able to sell it in either physical or digital form to create a profit for the purpose of writing and recording more songs while pursuing more venues to play music.</p>
</div><div>
<p>To check out our sweet Perks by Donating - see the column on the right of the page!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL?</strong></p>
<p>Both myself, and the band, decided early on that all the donations we receive is going to the making of the EP no matter what. <u>We believe in it that much!</u> But, we're also believing that more support may be given than what we're asking for...and if that happens - we'll be able to pursue the music in even greater ways!</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT YOU MAKE</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, your generous giving goes directly into the making of the EP as its found in the hands of those who are impacted by the music we make. In fact, we appreciate your support so much that when you give $40 we'll include your name on our website and album itself. </p>
<p><u>Every gift you give, will become a part of the story and purpose of the music.</u></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>ARE THERE ANY RISKS?</strong></p>
<p>Of course. Thats what makes a story good and every adventure worth pursuing! This project could end up a dud, or it could become more than we imagined. The beautiful part is that no one knows! But we trust that after you listen to our first song, and receive updates about the other songs in the making, you will become as inspired as we are and believe in what we're pursuing.</p>

Jeune pianiste de talent
Sandrine Murengerantwali est une pianiste classique de nationalités Rwando-canadienne de 18 ans. Elle a commencé son apprentissage du piano à l’âge de 8 ans après avoir immigré au Canada avec ses parents. Sandrine a été la toute première à pouvoir donner un récital de fin d'année au terme de ses études au Collège Villa-Maria, qui existe maintenant depuis plus de 159 années.  
Pendant ses dix années de
formation, Sandrine a remporté plusieurs prix et bourses dont deux médailles
d’or au concours Marcelle-Corneille (2013-2014), le prix spécial d’excellence
au gala Résonnance de Villa-Maria, la
bourse complète de Vincent-d’Indy (Jean-de-Brébeuf), la bourse du collège
Marianopolis et la bourse Savoie de Villa-Maria.
Récemment, Sandrine a décidé d’utiliser
ses talents de pianiste afin d’aider sa communauté.


Malformation cardiaque
À sa naissance, Sandrine souffrait du CIV (Communication
Interventriculaire), une malformation cardiaque nuisant grandement à la
croissance d’un enfant. Heureusement, grâce à
l'employeur de son père, Sandrine a eu la chance de bénéficier d'une opération
chirurgicale au Kenya, seul traitement 
pour sauver sa vie. 
Aujourd'hui au
Rwanda, le pays d'origine de Sandrine, 2000 enfants attendent sans délais une
opération cardiaque, 10 000 sont atteints du CIV et demeurent sans diagnostic,
une centaine bénéficient chaque année d'une opération par les cardiologues de
TEAMHEART (la fondation américaine dépêchant ses médecins sur place
deux fois par année) et 20 enfants sont envoyés annuellement vers le Soudan,
l'Égypte ou l'Israël afin d'y être opérés d'urgence.
D'après
TEAMHEART, 15 à 20 enfants sont dans le risque de mourir à chaque
semaine s’ils ne sont pas opérés. C'est donc avec cette constatation amère
que Sandrine a décidé de mettre sur pied une fondation, Vivo Cuore (Coeur Vif),
afin d'intervenir auprès de ces enfants endurant aujourd’hui cette maladie
qu’elle-même a dû combattre jusqu’à ses 4 ans.
Concert bénéfice et la fondation
Vivo Cuore
À partir de cette
campagne, Sandrine souhaite amasser 5000$ pour couvrir les dépenses liées à son
premier récital qui aura lieu à L'Université Concordia (la location de la salle, les nécessités audio-visuelles et les frais
afférents). 
L'idée de ce
concert-bénéfice date de 4 ans lorsque Sandrine a commencé à se produire
dans les  événements de son école, lors des graduations et autres
événements importants.
 Depuis plus de 4
mois, Sandrine a constitué une équipe pour sa fondation. Cette dernière est
formée de médecins, d’experts juridiques et financiers ainsi que des
étudiants travaillant tous ensemble sur une base bénévole.
Impact
Sandrine souhaite amasser au moins 15 000$  chaque année, afin de
pouvoir faire opérer 2 enfants. 
Merci pour votre appui!

<h3>OOTober!<br/>Opera on Tap Appreciation Month.</h3>

<li>That's $10 from 250 people</li>
<li>or $25 from 100 people</li>
<li>or $2,500 from Placido Domingo, or someone like that. </li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Opera on Tap provides informal singing opportunities for classical singers</b> allowing them to work on their craft in a relaxing, supportive and, dare we say it, FUN environment.  </li>
<li>
<b>Opera on Tap Los Angeles alone has performed over 150 of classical music's best arias and songs in bars and rock clubs!</b> That's 150 of the greatest pieces of music ever written made accessible to people who are only used to hearing opera sell cars and pizza in commercials. </li>
<li>
<b>Opera on Tap works with composers helping them workshop and premier new works</b>. Some of the money raised will be allocated to helping these new works tour Opera on Tap chapters across the nation. </li>
<li>
<b>Finally, Opera on Tap demystifies Opera by sharing it in an intimate, visceral format</b>. Not enough people have felt their toes vibrate and heart quicken when a highly trained, powerful vocal artist sings to them mere feet away while looking them in the eyes.</li>

Our intention is to raise $15,000 nationwide to support our singers and pianists who donate their time fighting the good fight bringing Opera back to the people one aria at a time. 


Our Goal is to Raise $2,500!

That's $10 from 250 people
or $25 from 100 people
or $2,500 from Placido Domingo, or someone like that. 

Where will this money go?

$1000 will go to pay our FABULOUS pianists.
$250 will go to cover PR and printing costs.  

and $1,250 will be sent back to the OOT mothership in NYC to support the ongoing dream of bringing opera back to the people EVERYWHERE. 



We're Important, Damn It, and Here's Why 



Opera on Tap provides informal singing opportunities for classical singers allowing them to work on their craft in a relaxing, supportive and, dare we say it, FUN environment.  

Opera on Tap Los Angeles alone has performed over 150 of classical music's best arias and songs in bars and rock clubs! That's 150 of the greatest pieces of music ever written made accessible to people who are only used to hearing opera sell cars and pizza in commercials. 

Opera on Tap works with composers helping them workshop and premier new works. Some of the money raised will be allocated to helping these new works tour Opera on Tap chapters across the nation. 

Finally, Opera on Tap demystifies Opera by sharing it in an intimate, visceral format. Not enough people have felt their toes vibrate and heart quicken when a highly trained, powerful vocal artist sings to them mere feet away while looking them in the eyes.

This is what bringing Opera to the people is all about!

My name is Steve Robertson and I am
the founder/CEO of Project Peace on Earth, LLC. (PPOE).  I have dedicated my life to helping create world peace. I am also the creator and Executive
Director of Project Peace On Earth's (PPOE) the World Forgiveness Project scheduled for this Christmas Day, December 2013 from Bethlehem. 


THE PROJECT PEACE ON EARTH (PPOE)  MISSION: is to harness the
power of sacred/inspirational music and then broadcast it worldwide from sacred
sites in order to inform and empower more compassionate, loving and wise
thought processes.  We are focusing our peace initiatives within the
Middle East, and specifically, the Palestinian / Israeli area of conflict.






Can there be a more important place to bring about a lasting peace than to the Middle East Palestinian / Israeli conflict?




THE POWER OF MUSIC: 







Why sacred music so important?  Why will it make a
difference? “People say that the soul on hearing the song of creation
entered the body but, in reality, the soul itself was the song…Music should be
healing, music should uplift the soul, music should inspire; then there
is no better way of getting closer to God, of rising higher towards the spirit, if only the music is
rightly understood.""
 The great 14th Century Sufi Master Hazrat Inayat Khan, in
his book ""The Mysticism of Sound and Music"" – considered by many to
be the bible on music.




We believe that sacred music has the power to inform a new
spiritual awareness within the heart and mind of its listeners.  Such new
thought processes can lead to greater personal and collective states of inner
peace, compassion, forgiveness and love so that outer peace is made more
possible and real. 





“All that we are is a result of what we have
thought” – Buddha

“The ancestor of every action is thought.” –
Emerson
“As a
man (“Man” – a Sanskrit word for Consciousness) thinketh in his heart, so is
he.” King Solomon, the Bible. 




PERSONAL FORGIVENESS GLOBAL IMPACT: 



A
global social-media campaign encourages people worldwide to submit forgiveness
messages via The World Forgiveness Project Facebook page:
- Photos of
loved ones over whom individuals are suffering a loss and/or want to forgive -
Art and Poetry - Written lists of judgments, grievances, heartbreak and/or anger towards other
people, institutions that they are choosing to forgive, release and heal.




Palestinian Forgiveness
Ambassadors place forgiveness messages received from around the world on the
Art Structure:





Ambassadors are video taped as they acknowledge, read and
document each message of forgiveness. - Musicians inspire and empower the
Forgiveness Structure building process and placement of messages. - Native
American elders and Spiritual Leaders help facilitate the ritual healing and
cleansing of each thought-divide. (Navajo and Hopi elders have already
confirmed their support and participation in this ceremony).

""Steve Robertson is the quintessential global peacemaker."" - Caroline Myss, National Best Selling author, Anatomy of the Spirit. 




THE WORLD FORGIVENESS CEREMONY



At Dusk, the “Art of
Forgiveness” structure now covered with: photos, art, poetry and lists of
wounded thoughts is readied for the fiery release of wounded and judgmental
thoughts so as to empower a new transformational beginning of greater love.
  Palestinians, and others who have traveled from around the world,
surround the “Art of Forgiveness” structure. People cry out and choose release and forgive. 

WORLDWIDE IMPACT





Your contribution will empower over a 100 million
viewers to partake in a united opportunity to forgive and live in greater love.   People from around the globe will watch Bethlehem’s televised and webcast
star-studded inspirational concert. 
As the last note of the Bethlehem concert
crescendos, and simultaneous broadcast feed then switches live to Gaza.  
Here, the world now watches the fiery ceremonial release of forgiveness as an
art structure is ignited and burns to the ground while.  Here, some 1000 people, each
holding a light for peace, gather to form the words “Forgive All”.  





BROADCAST/WEBCAST




Video walls connect the audiences at the Gaza Ceremony and
Bethlehem Concert. From orbiting space, a special
satellite brings to the world, the ceremony from Gaza.
Satellite imagery captures the moment of our world united in Forgiveness and open to new possibilities of love.














""Robertson
does not merely write about a vision of peace and personal empowerment, but he
has lived it on the world stage.    Robertson is a living avatar
on whose shining example our future may depend."" - Larry Dossey, MD - New York Times bestseller HEALING WORDS: THE POWER
OF PRAYER.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A few years ago, Lisa Rosinsky and I hatched a plot to create music for her words. This year, Colin Read made it happen.</h3>
<p>He set Lisa's ""Fairytales and Letters"" to music and I premiered it with Bethany Pietroniro at the piano.  We adorned the room in nature photography by Jon Barrows. It was a glorious celebration of art, artists, love, and spring.</p>

<p>The full program that evening included other works by Argento, Strauss, and Ravel, that explored the themes of this poetry in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>It was so successful as a program that many suggested we record it.</p>

He set Lisa's ""Fairytales and Letters"" to music and I premiered it with Bethany Pietroniro at the piano.  We adorned the room in nature photography by Jon Barrows. It was a glorious celebration of art, artists, love, and spring.

The full program that evening included other works by Argento, Strauss, and Ravel, that explored the themes of this poetry in meaningful ways.
It was so successful as a program that many suggested we record it.
So, we're recording it and releasing it independently, with album art featuring the photography of Jon Barrows, the poetry of Lisa Rosinsky, and Danielle's personally written program notes.



Danielle: ""New music, and multimedia projects, are close to my heart, because I think we can learn a lot from combined perspectives.  New music teaches us about old music -- helps us find it relevant and fresh.  Art helps us see music, and music helps us hear poetry.""

I am a singer-songwriter and that roller-skating songstress from George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars. I’ve also been on TV as Peachez in Flavor of Love and released a couple of solo albums. Metamorphosing once again, I bring a new project in three dimensions “Space Queen”.
“Space Queen” is my inner warrior.  Music that reaches into the electronic world with the pop tinged productions of Billy Triplett, yet maintains the soulful touch of a funkateer. “Space Queen” is a CD with a 3D experience. Each album comes with a pair of 3D glasses so that you can admire the 3D artwork and watch the 3D videos. Check out this cool 3D picture below!These songs are so important to me because they represent where I was, the tribulations I have concurred, and the spirit and artist that I am becoming. I wrote and recorded the songs at the Holiday Music Motel in 2012 with the late Billy Triplett.  Early this year we added members of Parliment-Funkadelic to the recordings. Billy passed away this August while finishing the mixes. He was a magician, and I am releasing ""Space Queen""  in his honor. In order to complete this dream, I need to raise $10,000. These funds will be used to pay for mixing, mastering, CD pressing, videos, promotion, and musicians. This is your chance to join the mission.
I have lots of amazing new perks to offer in exchange for donations of any amount, from CD's to calendars and hardcopy books.  You can see them all on the right hand side.

En aquel entonces, no tenía ni idea de lo que acabaría siendo una Vietparty... tan solo quise montar una fiesta diferente, juntar a la gente que quería y compartir con ellos un día lleno de locura. El concepto enganchó a muchos y desde entonces mucha gente cada año me pide que la organice. Por desgracia, como pasa con las olimpiadas o el mundial de fútbol es imposible que haya una cada año. </p><p>10 años después de la primera Vietparty, estoy organizando la cuarta edición... No te la pierdas o puede que no vivas otra hasta dentro de 5 años.</p><p> </p><p><strong>QUIERO QUE ESTÉS</strong></p><p>Lo que no ha cambiado desde la primera edición, es que estas fiestas son especiales por la gente que asiste. Cuando juntas a mucha gente a la que quieres el resultado siempre es fantástico y emocionante. Si has recibido el link a esta página, significa que has sido invitado a la Vietparty y que sin duda alguna ¡te quiero y quiero que asistas!</p><p> </p><p><strong>LA FINANCIACIÓN</strong></p><p>Para organizar esta fiesta he decidido volver a recurrir a un modelo de Crowdsourcing party, ¡como más recaudemos mejor será la fiesta!</p><p>Te pido que aportes para este día inolvidable. Será el mejor regalo de cumpleaños que podrás hacerme.</p><p>A tener en cuenta:</p><ul>
<li>¡¡¡He adelantado mucho dinero para que esta fiesta sea posible, no me quiero arruinar con 35 años!!!</li>

En aquel entonces, no tenía ni idea de lo que acabaría siendo una Vietparty... tan solo quise montar una fiesta diferente, juntar a la gente que quería y compartir con ellos un día lleno de locura. El concepto enganchó a muchos y desde entonces mucha gente cada año me pide que la organice. Por desgracia, como pasa con las olimpiadas o el mundial de fútbol es imposible que haya una cada año. 10 años después de la primera Vietparty, estoy organizando la cuarta edición... No te la pierdas o puede que no vivas otra hasta dentro de 5 años. QUIERO QUE ESTÉSLo que no ha cambiado desde la primera edición, es que estas fiestas son especiales por la gente que asiste. Cuando juntas a mucha gente a la que quieres el resultado siempre es fantástico y emocionante. Si has recibido el link a esta página, significa que has sido invitado a la Vietparty y que sin duda alguna ¡te quiero y quiero que asistas! LA FINANCIACIÓNPara organizar esta fiesta he decidido volver a recurrir a un modelo de Crowdsourcing party, ¡como más recaudemos mejor será la fiesta!Te pido que aportes para este día inolvidable. Será el mejor regalo de cumpleaños que podrás hacerme.A tener en cuenta:
¡¡¡He adelantado mucho dinero para que esta fiesta sea posible, no me quiero arruinar con 35 años!!!
Como más recaudemos más heavy será la fiesta... ¡Colabora!
Piensa en cuánto dinero te gastas en una noche de fiesta normal entre cena y copas... Esta fiesta será infinitamente mejor... ;)

<b><h3>Why the Lyre?</h3></b><ul>
<li>The modern lyre has a distinctive ""freed tone""; the sound frees itself from the physical materials of the instrument and moves into the periphery around the listeners. Lyre tones do not ""demand"" our attention; rather, they invite us to listen more actively, with intention. Thinking of the social needs of our time, we can say that listening is a capacity that humanity desperately needs to cultivate and lift to a new and more conscious level. When we are enveloped by the warmth and light of the lyre tone, we are nourished. However, when these living tones are ""reproduced"" electronically, the spiritual being of the tone cannot be fully experienced. We invite you to be nourished by being personally and directly in the presence of a lyre as it is played!</li>
<li> Rudolf Steiner, philosopher and seer of the early twentieth century, made the suggestions that were used for the building of the first modern lyre in 1926. He said that it will be necessary for humanity to develop a ""musical listening capacity"" to help us evolve to a higher and more loving level of consciousness. The lyre is a major carrier of that task.</li>

Now, because of him, Japan is a top location for lyre teaching and playing – he’s been a guest teacher at International Conferences in Europe, focusing on all aspects of lyre playing and tone production. His teaching style is unique, so we want to feature him and share him with North America!

Your contribution, no matter how small, will help spread the word about the lyre and our work!

If 10 full paying people come, the operating expenses to bring our master lyre teacher will be covered, but other expenses will fall short. If we don’t reach our goal, fewer people will be offered scholarships. So, the more we raise, the more the participation.

<p>The ones
who don´t know me yet my name is <b>Heidi Parviainen</b>, I´m a classical
singer from Finland. But you may know me better from by previous band, <b>Amberian
Dawn. </b>In 2012 our path together came to its´ end. Back then I
already knew I wanted to make something different, something that would not
maybe be so ""radio friendly"" but would create a whole new world
around music, music that would combine elements of <b>film music </b>and<b>
metal music</b> and even some<b> music theater</b> too. And so I started a very
ambitious project, <b>DARK SARAH</b>, where all the elements: music, story, videos, photos etc. would support each other like in a good
movie.</p>
<h3>DARK SARAH´s DEBUT ALBUM

follows a certain story line and tells a story of <b>a young woman called Sarah</b> who after a

For this third solo recording, I'll be turning to a group of early English

Painted Tale, features songs for lute and viola da gamba by John Dowland, Thomas Morley and Henry Purcell, as well as some incredible gems by some of their lesser-known contemporaries John Blow, Alfonso Ferrabosco, and Nicholas Lanier.  Taking a cue from the operatic and theatrical practice of creating pastiche works during this period in musical history, rather than simply recording a simple selection of of these early English musical miniatures, I've assembled these incredible songs into a pastiche song-cycle that tells a story of love gained and then lost.What has always drawn me so powerfully to song is its timelessness. Reading the poetry in these songs I am fascinated by how little the human experience has changed over the centuries.  The highs and lows of falling in and out of love have remained the same after all this time!  By assembling these various songs into a cycle, I am hoping that creating a dramatic context for these pieces will highlight how relevant this material still is today.In addition to recording these works, my colleagues and I will perform this program in my second solo recital at Carnegie Hall on March 18, 2015.This album will be recorded October 22 & 23, 2014 at Skywalker Sound in Marin County, CA.

simple - <b>Send Local Girls</b><b> to Rock Camp!</b>  I'll be spearheading a <b>video campaign</b> as a documentation of short videos from the road.  The topics I'll cover and then ask other

<i>Breaking Barriers in the Business, </i>and
any other fun personal stories. </p>
<p>The purpose of these videos, and what I hope viewers will be

music, our techniques, why we do it, how it benefits us, how it makes
us feel and how it bridges and creates different communities.</p>

aiming to raise $1,200! The funds raised for these videos will send 4 campers

Camp Vancouver is a project for female youth aged 8-17. The organization hosts a
week long music camp and various workshops for
one week during the summer months. GRCV provides young women the opportunity to
explore, access and create music with the guidance of positive mentors. With

Rock Camp Vancouver! </span></p>
<br/></div>","My Indiegogo campaign is quite
simple - Send Local Girls to Rock Camp!  I'll be spearheading a video campaign as a documentation of short videos from the road.  The topics I'll cover and then ask other
influential women in the music business to respond to through video are: Lessons from Touring, Things I Wish I Knew as a Young Musician,
Breaking Barriers in the Business, and
any other fun personal stories. 
The purpose of these videos, and what I hope viewers will be
able to take away, is to learn a few things about the various approaches to
music, our techniques, why we do it, how it benefits us, how it makes
us feel and how it bridges and creates different communities.
I am
aiming to raise $1,200! The funds raised for these videos will send 4 campers
to Girls Rock Camp Vancouver 2015. It cost's approximately $300 for a camper to
participate during the week, this covers things like daily lunches and snacks,
instruments and gear, and many juice boxes!
Some
background information from GRCV:
Girls Rock
Camp Vancouver is a project for female youth aged 8-17. The organization hosts a

explore, access and create music with the guidance of positive mentors. With
the ultimate focus on building communications skills, GRCV strives to diminish
sexism and other forms of oppression through creating a safe space for
creativity and fun and for sharing resources and knowledge. We believe that
every person deserves to love and believe in themselves regardless of economic
status, sexual orientation, gender, race, religion or size and that every
person deserves the opportunity to develop the necessary skills to move through
their lives with confidence and success.

<h2>PHIL DOUBLET</h2>
<p>To those who have heard Phil play guitar, the experience is memorable.  </p>
<p>Phil Doublet is a Christchurch based musician who is at home playing blues and country music, genres in which he is highly regarded and also keeps busy as a music teacher, session player, performer and composer.</p>
<p>Phil has developed his skills now for nearly 3 decades, in concert, in the studio or just jamming around at home. Phil is one of that rare group of restless, artistic spirits who cannot sit around without either tapping his hands, feet, or grabbing a musical instrument from a corner and jamming out a tune. It is this very spirit that drives such people to be consummate experts of their instruments.</p>
<p>Phil has spent the majority of his time as a session musician for others. He has enough original material to fill 3 albums and now with enough encouragement &amp; “helpful” pressure from those around him he’s ready to record his debut album. </p>
<p>By contributing toward Phil's debut album you'll be helping make a lifelong goal come to fruition.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>THE PLAN</h2>
<p>In the big scheme of things $5000 isn't a big budget for an album however with good 'can do' attitude Phil plans on putting it all to good use. The majority of the funds will go towards studio time, mixing, mastering, manufacturing and album artwork.</p>
<p>To get the most bang for your buck Phil will put his multi instrumentalist skills to good use by playing an assortment of string instruments himself. The album will be mixed &amp; mastered at Nightshift Studios in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Any money left over will be put towards a decent marketing campaign, a release party &amp; if we get well over $5000 we will look at making a music video.</p>
<p>All in all by contributing you're pretty much pre-purchasing your copy of the album. If you feel like being extra amazing you can even book Phil for a private gig!</p>
<p>Now of course if the fundraising isn't completely successful Phil will continue to make the album regardless - it may just be scaled back a little....but with good support I'm sure we don't even need to worry about that!</p>
<p>Phil has worked on numerous artists albums over the years as a session musician and this is a big step for Phil to put himself out there. For those who have seen Phil on stage there's no question about whether it's worth contributing.</p>

<p>Jing Lu began studying <em>yangqin</em> (Chinese dulcimer) at age four, when she became known as a child prodigy. As a result of her outstanding performances and continued success, she received the highest scores in the country and was admitted to the Central Conservatory of Music for classical <em>yangqin</em> at the age of twelve. Lu received her B.A. in Music Performing Arts from the top music conservatory in China, the Central Conservatory of Music (CCOM).  Upon graduation, Lu decided to continue her studies in the United States. She is currently a third-year student at Columbia University and will receive her M.F.A. in Stage Management in May 2013. Current credits include: ASM for <em>Three Women</em> and <em>AK-47 Sing-Along</em> in the 2010 New York Fringe Festival; SM for <em>Broken Wings</em>, <em>Washing Away</em>, and <em>Birthday Triage</em>; PSM for the musical <em>Golden Poplar</em> in Beijing’s Poly Theatre; PA for <em>Flambé Dreams</em> and PA/Wardrobe Supervisor for <em>A Letter to Harvey Milk</em> at the New York Musical Theatre Festival; PA for <em>Golden Child</em> at Signature Theatre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the <em>Yangqin</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The original meaning of the words “<em>yangqin</em>” is different from its modern meaning. The character for “<em>yang</em>” has an original meaning of “foreign”, as the instrument’s origins can be traced back to Persia. However, the character “<em>yang</em>” has developed over history to also mean “acclaimed”. “<em>Qin</em>” simply means “zither”, so together “<em>yangqin</em>” has the meaning of “acclaimed zither”. It is believed that China discovered the dulcimer more than 400 years ago via the Silk Road. The origins of the dulcimer might be linked back to the European clavichord, which may have been adopted and later transformed as it was introduced into Eastern communities. The <em>yangqin</em> is similar to the Western piano in how fundamental it is to China’s musical repetoire. The <em>yangqin</em> is performed either solo or with instruments like the <em>erhu</em>, <em>pipa</em>, and <em>dizi</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>About the Performance</strong></h2>
<p>Jing Lu possesses twenty years of professional stage experience and is one of the few concert yangqin performers residing in New York. This performance presents a dialogue between Eastern and Western musical traditions; provides a great opportunity for spreading Chinese Dulcimer in New York; in addition to traditional Chinese works, Lu will also play pieces from the Western classical repertoire, such as <em>Csárdás</em>, <em>Asturias (Leyenda)</em>, and <em>Flight of the Bumblebee</em>. She will also perform together with <em>pipa</em> player Zhou Yi.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Who is Micah's Rule?</h3>
Micah's Rule is a vocal trio originating from Wilmington, NC. Made up of Alto: Mary Anne Hewett, Baritone: Greg McCaw, Contralto: Chasity Scott, and singing the very best in inspirational, gospel, southern gospel, black gospel, country, and rock stylings with powerful voices and intricate harmonies. Group name originates from the prophet Micah 6:8, ""He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"" (NRSV)</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
It is time for us to finally record our first long play recording project. We are all local community volunteers, all barely making ends meet for a livelihood and are unable to provide the capital ourselves to accomplish such a project. We are also all highly trained, gifted, and experienced musicians/singers, and do not care to do anything less than the very best on this project.</div>
<div>
<br/>On Saturday, <strong>October 13</strong>, we signed a project contract with the legendary Producer, <strong>Mark Moseley</strong>, Nashville, TN, <strong>Moserite Records</strong>, and of legendary Moserite Guitar fame (<a href=""http://www.soundcontrolstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.soundcontrolstudio.com</a>)! In addition, we secured simply the finest pianist in the business for the project, Grammy and Dove Award winner, <strong>Gordon Mote</strong> (<a href=""http://www.gordonmote.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gordonmote.com</a>)!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Sunday, November 11, we will sojourn back to Nashville and go to work on this project from Monday, <strong>November 12</strong> through Tuesday, <strong>November 20</strong>. We have been successful in raising half the funding necessary to complete our project, and paid half down with the signing of contracts. We need your immediate assistance in raising the other half!</div>
<div>
<br/>Our goal for this campaign is <strong>$20,000</strong>. Part of the original $20,000 we've already raised, however, is actually in the form of a $15,000 matching challenge pledge made by a few very dear friends here in Wilmington. They have generously agreed to match dollar for dollar what we raise in this online campaign, up to $15,000! So, every dollar you donate will actually be like two dollars donated! If you donate $100, it will be like donating $200! Please help us meet this pledged funding match!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact of Your Kindness</h3>
Wherever Micah’s Rule appears, and for whoever listens to our music, it is our hope that ALL will experience the uplift of loving embrace no matter what their situation of “otherness” might be. We bring a message of justice, mercy and humility, packed in copious amounts of faith, hope and love!

Micah's Rule is a vocal trio originating from Wilmington, NC. Made up of Alto: Mary Anne Hewett, Baritone: Greg McCaw, Contralto: Chasity Scott, and singing the very best in inspirational, gospel, southern gospel, black gospel, country, and rock stylings with powerful voices and intricate harmonies. Group name originates from the prophet Micah 6:8, ""He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"" (NRSV)

What We Need
It is time for us to finally record our first long play recording project. We are all local community volunteers, all barely making ends meet for a livelihood and are unable to provide the capital ourselves to accomplish such a project. We are also all highly trained, gifted, and experienced musicians/singers, and do not care to do anything less than the very best on this project.

On Saturday, October 13, we signed a project contract with the legendary Producer, Mark Moseley, Nashville, TN, Moserite Records, and of legendary Moserite Guitar fame (www.soundcontrolstudio.com)! In addition, we secured simply the finest pianist in the business for the project, Grammy and Dove Award winner, Gordon Mote (www.gordonmote.com)!
 
On Sunday, November 11, we will sojourn back to Nashville and go to work on this project from Monday, November 12 through Tuesday, November 20. We have been successful in raising half the funding necessary to complete our project, and paid half down with the signing of contracts. We need your immediate assistance in raising the other half!

Our goal for this campaign is $20,000. Part of the original $20,000 we've already raised, however, is actually in the form of a $15,000 matching challenge pledge made by a few very dear friends here in Wilmington. They have generously agreed to match dollar for dollar what we raise in this online campaign, up to $15,000! So, every dollar you donate will actually be like two dollars donated! If you donate $100, it will be like donating $200! Please help us meet this pledged funding match!

The Impact of Your Kindness
Wherever Micah’s Rule appears, and for whoever listens to our music, it is our hope that ALL will experience the uplift of loving embrace no matter what their situation of “otherness” might be. We bring a message of justice, mercy and humility, packed in copious amounts of faith, hope and love! And, when we say “ALL” we really, really do mean ALL!We Would Like to Bless You in return for Your Kindness

<p>We are <strong>The Brooklyn Blues Project</strong>, a NYC-based classic blues band!  Formed in 2011 by five die-hard blues lovers, the BBP (as we like to call ourselves) is all about digging into the best blues tunes ever recorded, by the best artists to ever take up the art—from Robert Johnson and Little Walter, on down to B.B. King, Eric Clapton, The Allman Bros., and more.  By following in the footsteps of these kinds of legends, we seek both to grow as musicians, and to make our audience happy in a way that only the blues can.</p>
<p><strong>The Recording</strong></p>
<p>In the short time we’ve been together, we’ve gotten some very positive attention in the city’s blues scene.  Now, like so many artists before us, we’re looking to get into a recording studio and lay down our interpretations of some classic tunes.  But making an album costs money, which is where lovely-you come in!</p>
<p><strong>The Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Luckily, we are all city dwellers, and the wonderful recording studio we have our hearts set on is local, so there’s no issue of transportation or housing.  However, our research division (ahem) tells us that covering the cost of recording—from the initial tracking, to the mixing, to the final mastering—on through the actual, physical reproduction and distribution of the album, will run around $8000.  To wit:</p>
<p><strong>-Studio Time</strong> (Richard Fabrizio, Engineer): ~$4000</p>
<p><strong>-Mastering </strong>(Audio Mastering &amp; Mixing Studio): $700</p>
<p><strong>-CD Replication</strong> (Discmakers.com): $1000</p>
<p><strong>-UPC</strong> (to legally sell the album): $50</p>
<p><strong>-Download Cards </strong>(Soundtrax): $300</p>
<p><strong>-Digital Distribution</strong> (iTunes, Spotify, etc): $50</p>
<p><strong>-CD Distribution</strong> (CDBaby, Amazon): $1000</p>
<p><strong>-Photo Session </strong>(Stefan Tonio, Photog): $250</p>

<p><strong>-Custom BBP Guitar Picks</strong> (a big hit with fans so far): $50</p>
<p><strong>-Bumper Stickers</strong>: $50</p>
<p><strong>-E-blasts</strong> (ReverbNation): $15</p>
<p><strong>The Rewards</strong></p>
<p>In return for your support, you will get more than just the satisfaction of helping to usher more good blues music into the world; we also have a ton of treats and prizes for those who pledge, from BBP guitar picks, to signed merch, to one-on-one lessons with band members, and even private performances!</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Fort York are Connor Lavelle, Kyle Fulton, Dan Lefebvre, Rory Lavelle and Nick Kewin: a group of great friends who love music. We've known each other since we were kids going to sleep-away camp together every summer, where we taught each other how to write and play music. 2 years ago, we finally had the chance to spend some time recording the songs we'd worked on for ages thanks to the help of some old friends. The end was result was <em>Feels Like Then</em>, an 8 track EP that we're incredibly proud of. </p>
<p><em>Feels Like Then</em> was a community effort supported by friends and family at every step - recording, producing, mixing, mastering, packaging and distributing. It took over 2 years to get the album out, even though all the songs were written. While it was a success, this time we want to get the music out into the world sooner and without having to rely as much on the generosity of the same few people that helped us in the past. We're so excited that a site like Indiegogo exists that can help us achieve this! </p>
<h3>Why we're doing this</h3>
<p>We're hoping that through this campaign, and the EP it hopefully funds, that we'll get the attention of a label, who feel as strongly about our songs as we do. But more than that, we're just eager to share the best version of our new songs with the friends and fans we already have, and we've learnt that unfortunately, this isn't something done cheaply. </p>
<h3>What we need </h3>
<p>In order to record and release this album, we need to pay for:</p>
<p>- Studio Time<br/>- Production<br/>- Mixing<br/>- Mastering<br/>- Promotions and Marketing</p>
<p>We've gotten all our estimates together, and this is going to cost us $3,500.</p>
<h3>What you can do</h3>
<p>We'd ask that you give our music a listen, and if you like it, consider donating a bit to our project. As your donations come in, we'll start recording! </p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>Check out our incentives - they're coool!</p>

the new jazz and improvised music scene, grown out of a love for 
improvisation and bringing audiences and artists together in new ways. 
Since founded in 2007 by Adam Schatz, it has grown into one of the most 
exciting new jazz organizations around.
With the $75,000 raised last year through Kickstarter, S&R created a
 welcoming, dynamic new home for the new jazz and improvised music scene
 with SearchAndRestore.com and presented the Winter Jazzfest, Undead 
Jazzfest, and the Spontaneous Construction series at the Blue Note. Now
 Search & Restore has huge plans for 2012. We hope to strengthen our
 infrastructure and presence as a non-profit, and take increased steps 
towards bringing this music to more people around the world. Rather than
 become reliant on large donors or grant funding, we are attempting to 
identify a participatory audience through our fundraising. If 8,000 people give $25, we'll have our entire 2012 budget taken 
care of, supported by 8,000 fans of the music. It's cheap! It supports a
 good cause! It connects a fan base for the music! It's TAX DEDUCTIBLE! So if you are excited 
by what we're doing, please donate $25. We believe in the power of word 
of mouth, so if you believe in us, send this on to 10 people.  
Now,
 of course, you are welcome to donate more than $25. We are incredibly 
grateful for all the support we've received so far, and feel a true 
commitment to everyone who gives to Search & Restore. We promise to 
give back with creative presentations of the new jazz and improvised 
music that is growing in New York and beyond. 
To find out more about Search & Restore, and see many of the videos we've shot so far, head over to http://SearchAndRestore.com, and sign up for the email list to be kept in the loop.Search & Restore's 2012 Plan is below, where all the money we're trying to raise will be going. Below that is a press release for the new website and fundraiser as well. Thank you so much for your support! Without it, we would not be able to continue.


THE SEARCH AND RESTORE 2012 PLAN

Here To Stay: A Residency Project


Once a month, Search And Restore
will present a 3-night run for different artist, either three of their
different groups, or the same group for all the nights, giving artists who
would never have a chance to showcase for more than one or two nights a chance
to grow musically with an audience. Each night will have a different supporting
group, exposing them to a larger audience as well.

House Concert Series

An improvised house concert series
focusing on higher production value audio video, with three artists each
performing a short solo set then a collaborative one. There will be a small
audience present, but the focus will be on documenting the spontaneous
experience with multiple camera angles and multi track audio. Funds raised will
be used to pay the artists, record recording expenses, and use Search And
Restore.com as a way to distribute the content to fans of improvised music
around the world. 
 
Search And Restore.com
Search & Restore will continue
to document live shows throughout the city and building artist pages for the
performing musicians within SearchAndRestore.com, constantly expanding the
home base for the scene online.
 
Festivals
Funds raised for the Winter &
Undead Jazzfests will allow us to have a basic budget to better compensate the
artists, pursue more marketing approaches, and drive us to take exciting
risks with programming and alternative performance spaces. We’ll also be
developing relationships outside of New York and researching the best ways to
bring these festivals to new cities and countries, such as San Francisco,
Madison, Washington DC, Boston, and Portland.

Operating Costs

Search & Restore is a young
organization, and we are in need of a proper office space as well as a few
additional employees to ensure these new programs are carried out and promoted
properly. We will also be hiring a full time publicist and grant writer, and
develop a more cohesive marketing plan for the website so that we can reach new
jazz fans who love the music but don't have a way of accessing it on a frequent
basis.

Podcast: Making It Up As We Go

A weekly podcast series interviewing
artists from all ends of the spectrum about improvisation will move between
dialogue and live performance. Through this we aim to create more content to
engage fans of the music with the artists online, and to provide a new method
for the general public to hear how these artists approach improvisation and the
music as a whole.

<h3>Hi, I'm Jon</h3>
<p>    I am an independent country artist, who was born and raised in South Jersey. I fell in love with music at an early age and began to learn how to play music shortly after. I've always been in bands so I have been playing out and performing for the past few years.</p>
<p>    About 5 years ago I started listening to country music and that was it, I was hooked.

<h3> What I Need, What You Get</h3>
<p>    A lot of you know that recording an album can get very expensive. It's not just recording, it's pressing, mixing, mastering distribution and promotion. Last September I flew down to Nashville to record 2 songs, which are currently my two singles that I've recently put out. I funded that whole trip by myself, but this one I wont be so fortunate.</p>
<p>    This time I need your help. The $2500 will only cover recording cost but I am going to attempt to pay out all of the other costs on my own. If you contribute there are a bunch of great rewards that vary for each ammount of funds you contribute. Even if you can only contribute ten dollars or just spread the word, your contribution is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>Our vision is simple. A hub for every kind of artist. Currently we are opening a music venue, classrooms, and a store for local artist to sell their goods. We need your help because we want a push to finally get our doors open. We are constantly being asked by the public when they can play and when they can put their goods in our store.

<h3>Its our goal to have a place that changes the dynamic of the Music and Art industry. We want a place where a person can come in, learn to paint, use our supplies to paint it, and finally sell it there. We want a place where a musician can come in, rehearse, record an albumb, and have a place to sell it. This in a way gives everyone a chance to become an artist because simply, if you create or have ideas, you ARE an artist.</h3>

</div></div>","We are The Sacramento Arts Collective, aka The SAC. Currently we are trying to generate funds for a building we have been leasing for the last couple months. Inside we have been renovating, cleaning, building, etc. Now we need some help with the final stages.


Our vision is simple. A hub for every kind of artist. Currently we are opening a music venue, classrooms, and a store for local artist to sell their goods. We need your help because we want a push to finally get our doors open. We are constantly being asked by the public when they can play and when they can put their goods in our store. We just want to finally have a final date set because of such demand.


Its our goal to have a place that changes the dynamic of the Music and Art industry. We want a place where a person can come in, learn to paint, use our supplies to paint it, and finally sell it there. We want a place where a musician can come in, rehearse, record an albumb, and have a place to sell it. This in a way gives everyone a chance to become an artist because simply, if you create or have ideas, you ARE an artist.


For those who can't donate. Spread the word. Pass this along to anyone and everyone who you think could. Actually, even the ones you know who can't cause chances are they know someone who can.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Mike Bravener and at the age of 40 I left my job as a full-time clergyman to enter the entertainment business. I have been doing my Elvis Impersonation now for 11 years and have never been to Vegas. This year I was 1 of only 30 Pro Elvis Tribute Artists to perform in Las Vegas in July at what was The Hilton Showroom. I will also be performing in and around Las Vegas for promoters.</div>
<div>I have been squeaking by as an entertainer but have yet to get a big break. I still teach guitar, and work at a bookstore to bread on the table. I'm hoping something happens soon.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I need to fly my wife and I to Las Vegas, and have a little cash for food and hotel while I'm there. The promoters have given us a cheap hotel rate and will help to feed us, but there will be some costs</p>
<p>At my age of 51 I realise that Elvis was 42 when he passed away and with the shape I'm in and my looks I can still do a legit tribute for another 8 years or so, that's why I got invited! I also have a cd called ""Coverin Hank"" that I just released and with your contribution of $20.00 I would love to send you an autographed copy! I have gotten excellent reviews on this self recorded project and it has hit the stores yet. It features 11 Hank Williams Senior tunes and 3 of my original songs. 1 of those tunes made it to the Top 20 new songs for New Brunswick last month on CBC radio</p>
<p>If I don't reach my  goal, I will use the funds to towards my next full length cd of original songs. I will start recording that in the fall of 2013. BUT I WILL REACH MY GOAL!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>At 51 I still have a dream! That dream is to make a full-time living at bringing smiles to people's faces</li>
<li>I would love to tell people that yes I have performed in VEGAS on the same stage Elvis did for his VEGAS years</li>
<li>Help me make this a reality because these offers don't come every day. With over 30,000 pro Elvii in the world, the promoters asked only 30 - that is an incredible honor.</li>

<p><strong>Yoga and music are about making connections. We connect yoga with music and yogis and musicians with community.</strong></p>
<p>We're very excited about making this music CD and in fact we've already started. But a lot of the times when independent artists make CD's, they take out expensive loans which often times get paid out of the artists pockets. So VISA becomes the producer, and takes a lot of the profits.</p>
<p>We'd like to try a <em>new model</em>, so in the spirit of connecting people, we are reaching out to our wonderful community of yogis and musicians. <em>We're not asking for handouts.</em> <strong>Everyone who contributes gets CD's, downloads and other goodies for their money.</strong></p>
<p>This way, everyone gets involved, everyone benefits and we keep our money in the community, so we know where it gets spent. Most of the money we intend to receive will be directly going to the project costs solely.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of which, here's a breakdown of where the money will go:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing (1,000 copies) </strong>  $1,100</p>
<p><strong>Recording</strong> $1,500 (thanks to generous discounts of friends! Jason Sonier is our sound engineer for the project)</p>
<p><strong>Photography, video and design</strong> $500</p>
<p><strong>Marketing, publicity and administration</strong> $500</p>
<p><strong>Indie Go Go/ Pay Pal fees</strong> $300</p>
<p>So a bare-bones production like this still costs $3,600 or more. With the funds collected from this IndieGogo campaign, we'll be able to make the CD, everyone will get their copies and we'll all be prosperous!</p>
<p><strong>Should we make more than the alloted amount here, it'll all go into furthering the development of the product. Things like:</strong></p>
<p>- Paying artists to create our album art</p>
<p>- Travel costs to spread the Ottawa Yoga Community love beyond this city</p>
<p>- Postage costs for sending the kit beyond Ottawa</p>
<p>- Pay guest musicians on album</p>
<p><strong>Our intention is to let this be a beacon of light to highlight what the blossoming Yoga Community in Ottawa is capable of creating collectively. We plan to travel and share this music nationally and internationally. We want to share the love and bliss of the duo of yoga and music with anyone who is open to this transformative experience.</strong></p>
<p>Devin and Tara have been collaborating on live music and yoga classes since 2007. The beauty of their collaboration is the depth of Devin's extensive and eclectc array of musical experience and practice; along with Tara's extensive and thorough study of the science of sound, yogic chant, and the depth/correlation of specific chants/sounds and yoga postures. She believes that the pairing of a sound or chant sensitive music soundtrack with a typical yoga flow can deepen the effects of the practice within the yogi on both a physical, mental, spiritual and ethereal level.</p>
<p><strong>We are born with the rhythm of our heart, and we are vibrational beings.</strong></p>
<p>And so positive or healing sound coupled with intentional movement is the recipe for bhakti and asana bliss. Feedback repeatedly shared from students who have attended Bhavan2 classes state, ""That was the BEST class I've ever had in my life. I feel amazing."" or ""I come to this class in a cloud, and I leave feeling uplifted and transformed.""</p>
<p><em><strong>If music has the power to bring so many people together, Bhavan2 works to bridge the gap of positive sound with positive movement.</strong> </em></p>

<h3><strong>LES ARTS SOLIDAIRES: C’EST FINI!</strong></h3>
<p>Vicky Paradis, Abel Maxwell, Annie St-Pierre et David Muipatayi sont passionnés autant par les causes sociales que par toutes les formes d’arts. Sachant que les écoles de notre province proposent à leurs étudiants une multitude de programmes artistiques, ils ont conçus un concept de spectacle original de sensibilisation contre <strong><u>l’intimidation</u></strong> mais aussi en apporter des solutions. Durant un spectacle musical d’une durée d’une heure, les artistes en profiteront pour sensibiliser les jeunes contre <strong><u>ce fléau</u> </strong>qui affecte plusieurs vies autour de nous. Au delà de la sensibilisation, les artistes désirent offrir un suivi durable et personnalisé par l’intermédiaire d’un Site web qui sera à la disposition de chaque jeune afin d’échanger avec les artistes.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>L’INTIMIDATION est un problème relationnel qui consiste à avoir recours à la force et à la violence pour faire souffrir l’autre. L’enfant qui intimide apprend à utiliser la force et l’agression pour contrôler ses pairs. L’enfant victime d’intimidation se trouve coincé dans une relation où on abuse de lui; il aura besoin d’aide pour que cesse l’intimidation. Cette forme d’agression peut être physique, verbale ou non verbale; l’intimidation peut avoir lieu dans un face à face, elle peut se faire dans le dos de la victime ou via internet (cyberintimidation). Les actes d’intimidation prennent diverse formes, y compris l’exclusion, le bavardage malveillant, le harcèlement racial et sexuel ou l’homophobie.</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/><br/><strong>LES OBJECTIFS</strong></p>

</h3>
<p>Chaque artiste qui participe à ce projet a vécu différents styles d'intimidations ici au Canada ou ailleurs dans le monde. Aujourd'hui, en temps qu'artistes émergents et influents ils <strong><u>s'unissent</u></strong> pour contribuer au bien-être des jeunes au sein de leurs communautés.</p>
<p><strong>L'ORIGINE DE LEUR MOTIVATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>VICKY PARADIS – Adulte contemporain</strong></p>
<p>Ayant connu la scène musicale dès l'âge de 4 ans, l'enfance de Vicky Paradis n'a rien de commun. Elle a vécue des choses extraordinaires mais, également une pression accrue de son entourage qui s'est transformée en quelque sorte à l'intimidation. N'ayant pas droit à l'erreur, cette pression a pesée sur elle durant de longues années. Cette pression constante s'est aussi étalée sur les bancs des écoles sous forme de jalousie et de rejet.</p>
<p><em>Les parents de Vicky Paradis découvrent son talent dès l’âge de 4 ans. En 1988, alors qu’elle a seulement 6 ans, elle signe son premier contrat de disque. En 1993, à l’âge de 10 ans, elle lance son premier album solo avec l’étroite collaboration de Rick Allison (Lara Fabian), Marc Beaulieu (Roch Voisine) et Eddy Marnay (Céline Dion)  </em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>ABEL MAXWELL – Pop / R&amp;B</strong></p>
<p>La musique et les textes d'Abel inspire et motive de ne jamais baisser les bras face aux embûches de la vie. La persévérance et l'amour du prochain sont les portes-flambeaux de ses textes. Abel Maxwell croit en toute sincérité que l'estime de soi est l'arme ultime contre l'intimidation et la violence chez nos jeunes. Il veut à la fois divertir et éduquer pour de meilleurs lendemains dans une perspective collective et positive.</p>
<p><em>Abel Maxwell commence le piano au tendre âge de six ans en passant par les conservatoires nationaux de Lyon et d’Amsterdam. Arrivé au Canada en 2007, Abel inspire à travers sa musique aux couleurs de la soul-pop et jazz.. En 2010, il participe au festival international de Jazz de Montréal, en 2011 au festival de Jazz de Québec, en 2012 au festival international de jazz d’Ottawa avec le pianiste international Miguel de Armas (Cuba).</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>ANNIE ST-PIERRE Pop / Rock</strong></p>
<p>Annie a subi l'intimidation, l'abus verbal et sexuel dès son jeune âge. Pétrifiée par la honte et le manque de considération, son refuge a été la musique. Annie croît sincèrement que sa passion musicale qui en grande partie aide et encourage à se sortir des situations difficiles et à surmonter la pente et solidifier un estime de soi.<br/><br/><em>Annie St-Pierre est une chanteuse, élevée dans la région d'Ottawa qui tire son expérience vocale du ''Gospel''. Depuis sa tendre enfance. Son rêve est de pouvoir encourager de nombreuses vies avec sa voix et sa musique.</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>DAVID MUIPATAYI (ZPN) – Musique urbaine – Rap / Hip Hop</strong></p>
<p>Après plus de 10 ans au service de la francophonie ontarienne, ZPN a toujours été près des jeunes par le biais d'albums, de spectacles scolaires et d'ateliers d'écritures. David est un citoyen du monde, il a vécu en Afrique, en Europe et maintenant en Amérique du nord. Tous ces déplacements lui ont permis d'avoir une perspective de vie multidimensionnelle et une grande ouverture d'esprit. Toutes ses expériences lui ont permis de comprendre le malaise et le sentiment de solitude qu'un jeune peut ressentir parce que lui même s'est retrouvé à plusieurs reprises étranger donc, des fois mis de côté.</p>
<p><em>Son premier album solo, intitulé «Le masque de Z», paraît en 2003 et lui vaut plusieurs honneurs, dont le prix Trille Or de la Découverte de l’année et une nomination au Gala de l’Adisq. En 2006, ZPN récidive avec un deuxième album, «Sacrifices» En 2011, il revient avec PREMIÈRE CLASSE et continue de faire réfléchir le monde sur le racisme, la guerre, la violence, le respect de la femme </em><br/><br/></p>

Vicky Paradis, Abel Maxwell, Annie St-Pierre et David Muipatayi sont passionnés autant par les causes sociales que par toutes les formes d’arts. Sachant que les écoles de notre province proposent à leurs étudiants une multitude de programmes artistiques, ils ont conçus un concept de spectacle original de sensibilisation contre l’intimidation mais aussi en apporter des solutions. Durant un spectacle musical d’une durée d’une heure, les artistes en profiteront pour sensibiliser les jeunes contre ce fléau qui affecte plusieurs vies autour de nous. Au delà de la sensibilisation, les artistes désirent offrir un suivi durable et personnalisé par l’intermédiaire d’un Site web qui sera à la disposition de chaque jeune afin d’échanger avec les artistes.

L’INTIMIDATION est un problème relationnel qui consiste à avoir recours à la force et à la violence pour faire souffrir l’autre. L’enfant qui intimide apprend à utiliser la force et l’agression pour contrôler ses pairs. L’enfant victime d’intimidation se trouve coincé dans une relation où on abuse de lui; il aura besoin d’aide pour que cesse l’intimidation. Cette forme d’agression peut être physique, verbale ou non verbale; l’intimidation peut avoir lieu dans un face à face, elle peut se faire dans le dos de la victime ou via internet (cyberintimidation). Les actes d’intimidation prennent diverse formes, y compris l’exclusion, le bavardage malveillant, le harcèlement racial et sexuel ou l’homophobie.

LES OBJECTIFS
Adhérer au projet C’EST FINI! c’est…

Sensibiliser les jeunes (élèves) contre ce fléau qui dure depuis trop longtemps;
Entretien de 30 à 45 min. entre les jeunes et les artistes avant ou après les spectacles;
Créer un suivi et une sensibilisation constante pour les jeunes à l’aide d’un Site web (courriels et vidéos) Les artistes auront l’opportunité de répondre aux élèves par des messages d’encouragements audio-visuels personnalisés;
Fournir des bracelets promotionnels C'EST FINI! Où sera inscrit le Site web de la campagne, cela donnerait un sentiment d'appartenance et de soutien aux jeunes. Les bracelets seront distribués gratuitement après chaque spectacle pour établir le lien entre les jeunes et les artistes.

Le Site web sera interactif animé par les artistes afin de permettre aux élèves de se ressourcer en cas de besoin avec des conseils et des messages d’encouragements.

DÉROULEMENT DU PROJET

Rencontre entre les jeunes et les artistes avant ou après les spectacles
Spectacles de 4 artistes de 4 styles musicaux différents sur la même scène
Suivi par courriel et Site web avec les élèves intéressés
Messages d'encouragements par le biais de vidéos personnalisés adressés aux jeunes par l'artiste de leurs choix
Donner la possibilité aux élèves de créer un profile sur le Site web pour sécuriser les réponses qui leurs sont adressées par l'artiste de leur choix

Les artistes fourniront à chaque école participante des outils de promotion (affiches, bracelets de sensibilisation, pamphlets de sensibilisation, etc.)

QUAND LES ARTS SE METTENT AU SERVICE DE LA JEUNESSE…

Chaque artiste qui participe à ce projet a vécu différents styles d'intimidations ici au Canada ou ailleurs dans le monde. Aujourd'hui, en temps qu'artistes émergents et influents ils s'unissent pour contribuer au bien-être des jeunes au sein de leurs communautés.
L'ORIGINE DE LEUR MOTIVATION
VICKY PARADIS – Adulte contemporain
Ayant connu la scène musicale dès l'âge de 4 ans, l'enfance de Vicky Paradis n'a rien de commun. Elle a vécue des choses extraordinaires mais, également une pression accrue de son entourage qui s'est transformée en quelque sorte à l'intimidation. N'ayant pas droit à l'erreur, cette pression a pesée sur elle durant de longues années. Cette pression constante s'est aussi étalée sur les bancs des écoles sous forme de jalousie et de rejet.
Les parents de Vicky Paradis découvrent son talent dès l’âge de 4 ans. En 1988, alors qu’elle a seulement 6 ans, elle signe son premier contrat de disque. En 1993, à l’âge de 10 ans, elle lance son premier album solo avec l’étroite collaboration de Rick Allison (Lara Fabian), Marc Beaulieu (Roch Voisine) et Eddy Marnay (Céline Dion)  

ABEL MAXWELL – Pop / R&B
La musique et les textes d'Abel inspire et motive de ne jamais baisser les bras face aux embûches de la vie. La persévérance et l'amour du prochain sont les portes-flambeaux de ses textes. Abel Maxwell croit en toute sincérité que l'estime de soi est l'arme ultime contre l'intimidation et la violence chez nos jeunes. Il veut à la fois divertir et éduquer pour de meilleurs lendemains dans une perspective collective et positive.
Abel Maxwell commence le piano au tendre âge de six ans en passant par les conservatoires nationaux de Lyon et d’Amsterdam. Arrivé au Canada en 2007, Abel inspire à travers sa musique aux couleurs de la soul-pop et jazz.. En 2010, il participe au festival international de Jazz de Montréal, en 2011 au festival de Jazz de Québec, en 2012 au festival international de jazz d’Ottawa avec le pianiste international Miguel de Armas (Cuba).

ANNIE ST-PIERRE Pop / Rock
Annie a subi l'intimidation, l'abus verbal et sexuel dès son jeune âge. Pétrifiée par la honte et le manque de considération, son refuge a été la musique. Annie croît sincèrement que sa passion musicale qui en grande partie aide et encourage à se sortir des situations difficiles et à surmonter la pente et solidifier un estime de soi.Annie St-Pierre est une chanteuse, élevée dans la région d'Ottawa qui tire son expérience vocale du ''Gospel''. Depuis sa tendre enfance. Son rêve est de pouvoir encourager de nombreuses vies avec sa voix et sa musique.

DAVID MUIPATAYI (ZPN) – Musique urbaine – Rap / Hip Hop
Après plus de 10 ans au service de la francophonie ontarienne, ZPN a toujours été près des jeunes par le biais d'albums, de spectacles scolaires et d'ateliers d'écritures. David est un citoyen du monde, il a vécu en Afrique, en Europe et maintenant en Amérique du nord. Tous ces déplacements lui ont permis d'avoir une perspective de vie multidimensionnelle et une grande ouverture d'esprit. Toutes ses expériences lui ont permis de comprendre le malaise et le sentiment de solitude qu'un jeune peut ressentir parce que lui même s'est retrouvé à plusieurs reprises étranger donc, des fois mis de côté.
Son premier album solo, intitulé «Le masque de Z», paraît en 2003 et lui vaut plusieurs honneurs, dont le prix Trille Or de la Découverte de l’année et une nomination au Gala de l’Adisq. En 2006, ZPN récidive avec un deuxième album, «Sacrifices» En 2011, il revient avec PREMIÈRE CLASSE et continue de faire réfléchir le monde sur le racisme, la guerre, la violence, le respect de la femme

were set to cover postage costs throughout Canada, the US, and Europe. <br/><br/>
The campaign budget was set to allow for the books to be produced regardless of
the amount that is collected by the campaign. <br/><br/>
If I get the full amount, it will allow me to budget for two months of research
and development (scanning new images, writing, and design), in addition to the
time spent mailing out the books...and I'll be able to print a quantity of
books (2500) that will allow me eventually to be fully compensated for my time. <br/><br/>
If the goal is not met, then the books will be printed on demand, at a much
higher rate, and I'll end up needing to donate my time to the project....and
won't have the ability to recover my labour costs down the line. <br/><br/>

Condo (Tremblay) died on April 15, 2004, just a month short of his 54th

meeting to his death, Ray was a mentor, friend and an inspiration to me and to
countless others. It’s time that he was honoured with a book about his life and
art.  </span></b><b><span style=""font-family: Arial;""></span></b></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 14.0pt; line-height: 21.0pt;""><b><span style='font-family: ""Euphemia UCAS"";'>Ray
lived life without compromise, never doing anything that didn't have meaning to
him on a personal level. Sometimes he'd do things that drove his friends nuts,

merited.  </span></b><b><span style=""font-family: Arial;""></span></b></p><p></p></span><p></p>

how sick he might be... in 1986, I was in Vancouver for The Hardrock Goners
entire 6 week engagement at Expo 86. The band played shows every day and night but
one. At the end, Ray's voice was tired and showing the strain... but he was
still a wild man on stage, tapping into the very core of rock and roll.  </span></b><b><span style=""font-family: Arial;""></span></b></p><p></p></span><p></p>

used to co-manage The Hardrock Goners in the late 80s and early 90s. I partly
did this because I was a huge fan and wanted to see them perform more often,

of this work in one of our last conversations. After the European/Australian
tour, he and the Goners planned to do a 3 city mini tour to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the band. I was going to organize an exhibition of photographs
of the band to coincide.</span></b><b><span style=""font-family: Arial;""></span></b></p><p></p></span><p></p>

<p></p></div>","Ray
Condo was a country-swing, rockabilly
legend, and one of the more colourful characters of Toronto's Queen Street
(80's and 90's) scene.  I'm Gayle Hurmuses, a documentary photographer,
and for 19 years, I had the great pleasure to co-manage, book and publicize his
band The Hardrock Goners. I also photographed, filmed and
video-taped the band for nearly two decades. With Ray's passing in 2004, I
assembled an exhibition of 20 images: “I wish that it had been a dream” as a
tribute. To mark the 10th anniversary of his passing, I will be using
those photographs as the foundation of Ray Condo’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Party! a
memoir about Ray and his bands, The Hardrock Goners and The Ricochets.

This 40
page book  would include 50 – 70 images, personal
recollections, and shared stories about Ray and the community around him. To
make this happen, I need your help.
Publishing
the Memoir will require $15,000 to cover the cost of producing
and distributing the book. Ray was an important part of Rockabilly
history and I want to produce a book that paints a picture of who he
was, from the inside. As a fan of Ray Condo, or rockabilly, you can help make
that happen and get some cool stuff for yourself…most importantly, the book!
I’m also
offering some photographic prints from the memorial
exhibition ""I wish that it had been a dream"", animation
cels from ""Barroom Crazy"", a limited edition
t-shirt, a ""Zelig Edition"" of the book, and more.
Perk packages include mailing costs within North America and Europe, other
locations may require additional postage.
Your
contribution will help selecting, scanning, and preparing images for print,
writing, editing, book design and layout, distribution, promotion, developing
the website, and it will help ensure that there is an archive of Ray Condo
history in print for future fans of the music.
Although it
won’t be possible to thank you enough for your contribution, I’m going to try.
Within 14 days of your contribution and confirmation of your address, you will
be sent a limited edition postcard hand signed by me thanking you. There will
be pages on both the book and the website thanking contributors to the project
by name, (unless you wish to be ‘anonymous’) and with your book you will
receive a frameable, hand-signed Certificate of Appreciation.
Meanwhile,
thanks just for reading this!
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


Regarding the budget, contribution levels
were set to cover postage costs throughout Canada, the US, and Europe. 
The campaign budget was set to allow for the books to be produced regardless of
the amount that is collected by the campaign. 
If I get the full amount, it will allow me to budget for two months of research
and development (scanning new images, writing, and design), in addition to the
time spent mailing out the books...and I'll be able to print a quantity of
books (2500) that will allow me eventually to be fully compensated for my time. 
If the goal is not met, then the books will be printed on demand, at a much
higher rate, and I'll end up needing to donate my time to the project....and
won't have the ability to recover my labour costs down the line. 
I won't be collecting compensation for my time until the hard costs of printing
& mailing are covered. 
I'm often asked why I am doing this, so a longer
note on my motivations follows the section on Ray. 
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Ray
Condo (Tremblay) died on April 15, 2004, just a month short of his 54th
birthday on May 16, almost 19 years to the day after we met. From our first
meeting to his death, Ray was a mentor, friend and an inspiration to me and to
countless others. It’s time that he was honoured with a book about his life and
art.  
Ray
lived life without compromise, never doing anything that didn't have meaning to
him on a personal level. Sometimes he'd do things that drove his friends nuts,
and would neglect to do things that would lead to the success his talent
merited.  
In
performance he was always electrifying, and every show was amazing no matter
how sick he might be... in 1986, I was in Vancouver for The Hardrock Goners
entire 6 week engagement at Expo 86. The band played shows every day and night but
one. At the end, Ray's voice was tired and showing the strain... but he was
still a wild man on stage, tapping into the very core of rock and roll.  
As his
childhood friend Andy Tait commented, ""Ray always seemed so frail and
weak... but you would go on tour with him and see what his life on the road was
like and be shocked at just how strong he had to be to live like that...it's
strange to think he's gone.""
Ray
may be gone, but his spirit lives on. The campaign to create the book began on
August 10, 2013 and has already gained 410 active fans. The Indiegogo campaign
launched 5pm on the Saturday of the Labour Day long weekend, to coincide with a
Rockabilly festival in Montreal and in 5 days, collected $1020 in contributions
from around the world. This happened with an advertising spend to date of $25.
Pictures
that will be used in the book were shot in Toronto at The Cameron House, The
Horseshoe, and Sneaky Dee's, as well as at my home; others were shot in
Montreal, Vancouver, England, Wales, and Las Vegas, and span the period from
1986 -1999.
His
death left an empty space in the world of country swing, and a hole in the
hearts of his many friends, but his legend lives on and will be made tangible
with the publication of this book.
 
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
My reasons for doing this project are varied and deep, but the
story below is a powerful driver.  
As mentioned above, Ray and I were friends for 19 years, and I
used to co-manage The Hardrock Goners in the late 80s and early 90s. I partly
did this because I was a huge fan and wanted to see them perform more often,
and partly to learn the skills needed for my own work as a documentary
photographer/videographer. 
Consequently, I photographed them extensively. Ray and I spoke
of this work in one of our last conversations. After the European/Australian
tour, he and the Goners planned to do a 3 city mini tour to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the band. I was going to organize an exhibition of photographs
of the band to coincide.
At that point, I had pretty much given up actively doing
anything photography related. Ray was on me to do more new work and to exhibit
again...and to put some of the work in book form. I was excited about getting
back to it by putting that show on. 
We had also spoken of his desire for fame and his frustration at
its elusiveness…and then he brought up his heart problems. He’d had two heart
attacks in the previous few months and was struggling to live the kind of
whole-grain, ascetic lifestyle that would have helped him avoid further issues.
There is a lot more to that conversation that is worth telling a
story about, but that will likely end up in the book and it’s probably better
to write it at leisure than simply to dash it off...although this letter may
serve as the basis of my personal statement, which is really missing from the
indiegogo page...what is there is more of a project pitch.
In the end though, I made a gallows joke that cracked him up,
and promised him that if he died before he became famous, I’d do my part to
help make it still happen. So, that’s two promises in one conversation that I
still owe him.
It’s nearly 10 years later, and one promise is partially
fulfilled. I did have the show, although being rushed by Ray’s death, it was
not exactly what I had wanted. Completing the second half of the first promise
is part of keeping the second promise.

<p>Thank you for visiting my Indiegogo! <br/><br/>So i'm kind of new to the whole photography world... actually... very new. But in the last 8 months i'd like to think i've accomplished quite a lot! I'm about to be 20 years young and i've already shot for a couple magazines + have begun testing with agency represented models from some of the top agencies in Los Angeles! I never expected to get so infatuated with photography, but now it literally consumes my life. I don't think there's a day that i haven't spent at least an hour honing my craft and trying to improve my work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a boy can only shoot so many models on a plain, white wall, in his apartment for so long before it gets dramatically boring and stale and -- well, flat. With some stand alone lights i will be able to keep the creative juices flowing and continue to add more and more depth to my portfolio of work!</p>
<p>So that's where YOU come in! =D <br/><br/>I'm trying to build a mini studio in my apartment so i can continue to grow as a photographer and an artist. What does ""mini studio"" entail you ask?<br/><br/>• Backdrop stands -- the things you put that giant roll of paper on to make pretty pictures<br/>• Strobe Lights -- the equivalent to a giant flash -- like the one on your iPhone. Yes...<br/><br/>And last but not least...<br/><br/>• Backdrop Rolls -- basically giant sheets of colored material that make the background!<br/><br/>The only problem is... I seem to have ventured into one of the most expensive hobbies known to man kind. So if i ever want to construct this studio I'm going to need a bit of help! <br/><br/>Even if i can't fund raise the entire amount that i am seeking for this project any amount will help me achieve this end goal sooner rather than later! I don't need ""pro gear"" to create beautiful photos. Even cookie cutter equipment is better than nothing at this point! I pride myself on being ingenuitive. Is that a word?!<br/><br/></p>

<p>As i said before... i'm seeking a total of $1000. Yeah. Steep. I know.

So financing is not an option!<br/><br/>In the off-chance that i don't fund the entire amount -- even a minimum of $50 will help! That's an entire backdrop roll!<br/><br/>So WHY should YOU help ME!?  -- because i'm awesome for starters... <br/><br/>Also because i'm going to give away cool prints, photo shoots, photography / photoshop lessons and share all of my cool tips and tricks with you... or take you out to coffee because i'm cool like that!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is my future. I couldn't really imagine myself doing anything other than photography. I live and breathe photography now. I might have to ACTUALLY marry my camera if that ever becomes legal.

Yet, one could argue that recorded music is more easily accessible, and more affordable, than live music. Despite this, audiences attend live concerts to connect emotionally and spiritually to music, where studio recordings frequently offer stiffness, sacrificing artistic experience to achieve clean takes. Performers in our modern world feel pressured to deliver immaculate performances of technical perfection rather than exploring the reaches of their creative potential. This attempted flawlessness frequently comes at a cost to the musicians' emotional engagement, spontaneity, and artistic risk-taking.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; font-weight: normal;"">We believe that the discerning listener recognizes this difference in artistic freedom and openness.

Guided by the highest artistic ideals, the Trio’s mission is to give voice to the authentic, essential spirit of a composition, acting as a conduit between composer and audience. In sharing their boundless enthusiasm for music and the complex journey that leads from first rehearsal to performance, the Delphi Trio invites the larger community to engage their own powers of reflection and communication.</p><p><b>About the Ensemble</b></p><p>Praised for “…spot-on ensemble playing and a beautifully blended sound…” (San Francisco Classical Voice) and “...rich, committed string tone, dazzling pianism, rhythmic flexibility, and risky tempi...” (Sarasota Herald Tribune) the  Delphi Trio has become a powerfully eloquent voice in the world of chamber music.</p><p>Following a triumphant orchestral debut in Beethoven’s Triple Concerto op.56 with the San Jose Chamber Orchestra led by George Cleve, the Delphi Trio has concertized throughout the United States and Canada including performances at the Artist Series Concerts of Sarasota, Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival, WFMT Studios Chicago, Dakota Sky International Piano Festival, and the Banff Centre for the Arts.</p><p>2014-2015 season highlights include the Trio's second year as Ensemble-in-Residence at the Bear Valley Music Festival, appearances at Chamber Music Society of Little Rock, Chamber Music Sundays at Three presented by Southeast Missouri State University, the April in Santa Cruz Festival of Contemporary Music, performances in collaboration with Scott Parkman and American Music Century, and the release of the Trio's debut recording, featuring works by Haydn and Arensky.</p><p>The Delphi Trio is grounded in the immensely rich classic repertoire for piano trio and is committed to the exploration of its deep, lasting meaning for performers and audience alike. The Trio sees contemporary music as a natural extension of the standard repertoire and is dedicated to the music of our time. Championing works by Henry Cowell, Pierre Jalbert, and Joan Tower, Delphi has given acclaimed world premieres of Max Stoffregen's Coyote Plan (2013) and Sahba Aminikia's Deltangi-ha (2012) and Shab o Meh (2014). The Trio has commissioned William Bolcom to write his first piano trio, to be premiered during the 2015-2016 season.</p><p>The Delphi Trio believes chamber music is an ideal model for education. As faculty of the Crowden School's Summer Chamber Music Workshops for Youth and Adults, the Trio regularly coaches and mentors musicians of all ages. Delphi is committed to supporting young artists as they begin their careers and have established the Emerging Artist Program to guide collegiate students through their first independent public concertizing experience.</p><p>In addition to their work as a trio, Jeffrey, Liana, and Michelle perform in solo recital, larger chamber music, and as soloists with orchestra and believe in the symbiotic relationship between solo and collaborative work. They have individually performed with artists such as Robert Mann, Bonnie Hampton, Anthony Marwood, Menahem Pressler, and Paul Katz.</p><p>Liana Bérubé, Michelle Kwon, and Jeffrey LaDeur are graduates of the University of Toronto, Stanford University and the Eastman School of Music respectively, and formed the Trio while studying in the prestigious Chamber Music Program at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. They count among their mentors Henk Guittart, Bonnie Hampton, the St. Lawrence Quartet, and Stephen Prutsman, and have worked with Peter Wiley, Pedja Muzijevich, and Pamela Frank.</p><p>As an ensemble, the Trio has always made food and friendship a priority and believe that these elements are at the heart of great chamber music. The ensemble is built on trust and communication; to that end, each Delphi rehearsal starts in the same way: a meal, conversation, and music. </p><p> <br/></p><h2>THE CONCERT SPACE</h2><p>Use of the Maybeck Recital Hall was generously offered in-kind by its owners for the Delphi Trio's recording project. Maybeck Recital Hall, also known as Maybeck Studio for Performing Arts, is located inside the Kennedy-Nixon House located at 1537 Euclid Avenue in Berkeley, California, USA. It was built in 1914 by Bernard Maybeck. The hall seats up to 40 people and was designed upon commission for the Nixon family, local arts patrons who wanted a live-in studio for their daughter Milda's piano teacher, Mrs. Alma Kennedy. The room is paneled in unfinished clear-heart redwood, which contributes to an unusually rich and warm, yet bright and clear acoustic quality. Maybeck originally designed the space to accommodate an 1898 7-foot Bechstein, but its current resident is a 7-foot Yamaha rebuilt with Steinway parts.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/722322/files/20140716141240-2_40570772_Liv_windows.jpg?1405545160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>In 1923, the hall was destroyed in a hillside fire. It was rebuilt quickly by Maybeck. Milda Nixon lived at the residence until her death in 1981 at the age of 92. Her adopted son, Charles R. Fulweiler, then held the house for several years. In 1987, the house was purchased by jazz pianist Dick Whittington, who opened the hall for public recitals.<br/></p><p>Between 1989 and 1995, Concord Records produced 42 solo piano recitals in Maybeck Recital Hall.

The Delphi Trio will record two live concerts of the same repertoire, and release a professional début album drawn from both concerts with minimal editing. The album will capture the excitement and engagement of live performance while maintaining professional audio standards. With this project, the Delphi Trio will promote the authenticity and power of live performance, both in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area and throughout North America, and inspire listeners to attend more live performances in order to experience the magic of live music. The recording will be released in December 2014.Motivation""… Musicians resent that the perfection of the recording studio has crept into the expectations for the concert hall. It takes away their freedom to eschew technical perfection for the sake of achieving a musically expressive moment.""-Blier-Carruthers, Amy. Article. ""The Performer's Place in the Process and Product of Recording."" University of Cambridge (2013): 6.The demand for live performance is ever-growing in North America. Yet, one could argue that recorded music is more easily accessible, and more affordable, than live music. Despite this, audiences attend live concerts to connect emotionally and spiritually to music, where studio recordings frequently offer stiffness, sacrificing artistic experience to achieve clean takes. Performers in our modern world feel pressured to deliver immaculate performances of technical perfection rather than exploring the reaches of their creative potential. This attempted flawlessness frequently comes at a cost to the musicians' emotional engagement, spontaneity, and artistic risk-taking.We believe that the discerning listener recognizes this difference in artistic freedom and openness. In recording and releasing ""The Delphi Trio: Live,"" we want to bring the essential energy and experience of live performance into recording while achieving the highest audio quality. The performances on this recording represent our commitment to and passion for the power of live performance. What your involvement meansIn supporting our project, you become our audience. You help us bring out the power and emotional connectivity of live performance. An attentive audience brings an essential element to a live performance. We, as performers, feel the real hunger and desire of the individual listener to connect emotionally as we perform, giving us fuel and inspiration to communicate. It is a truly symbiotic relationship!Many aspects of our project are supported through your generous donations. Through private donations and grants, we have already secured funding for more than 40% of our expenses, and through your generous support, we can continue to raise the rest!

Guided by the highest artistic ideals, the Trio’s mission is to give voice to the authentic, essential spirit of a composition, acting as a conduit between composer and audience. In sharing their boundless enthusiasm for music and the complex journey that leads from first rehearsal to performance, the Delphi Trio invites the larger community to engage their own powers of reflection and communication.About the EnsemblePraised for “…spot-on ensemble playing and a beautifully blended sound…” (San Francisco Classical Voice) and “...rich, committed string tone, dazzling pianism, rhythmic flexibility, and risky tempi...” (Sarasota Herald Tribune) the  Delphi Trio has become a powerfully eloquent voice in the world of chamber music.Following a triumphant orchestral debut in Beethoven’s Triple Concerto op.56 with the San Jose Chamber Orchestra led by George Cleve, the Delphi Trio has concertized throughout the United States and Canada including performances at the Artist Series Concerts of Sarasota, Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival, WFMT Studios Chicago, Dakota Sky International Piano Festival, and the Banff Centre for the Arts.2014-2015 season highlights include the Trio's second year as Ensemble-in-Residence at the Bear Valley Music Festival, appearances at Chamber Music Society of Little Rock, Chamber Music Sundays at Three presented by Southeast Missouri State University, the April in Santa Cruz Festival of Contemporary Music, performances in collaboration with Scott Parkman and American Music Century, and the release of the Trio's debut recording, featuring works by Haydn and Arensky.The Delphi Trio is grounded in the immensely rich classic repertoire for piano trio and is committed to the exploration of its deep, lasting meaning for performers and audience alike. The Trio sees contemporary music as a natural extension of the standard repertoire and is dedicated to the music of our time. Championing works by Henry Cowell, Pierre Jalbert, and Joan Tower, Delphi has given acclaimed world premieres of Max Stoffregen's Coyote Plan (2013) and Sahba Aminikia's Deltangi-ha (2012) and Shab o Meh (2014). The Trio has commissioned William Bolcom to write his first piano trio, to be premiered during the 2015-2016 season.The Delphi Trio believes chamber music is an ideal model for education. As faculty of the Crowden School's Summer Chamber Music Workshops for Youth and Adults, the Trio regularly coaches and mentors musicians of all ages. Delphi is committed to supporting young artists as they begin their careers and have established the Emerging Artist Program to guide collegiate students through their first independent public concertizing experience.In addition to their work as a trio, Jeffrey, Liana, and Michelle perform in solo recital, larger chamber music, and as soloists with orchestra and believe in the symbiotic relationship between solo and collaborative work. They have individually performed with artists such as Robert Mann, Bonnie Hampton, Anthony Marwood, Menahem Pressler, and Paul Katz.Liana Bérubé, Michelle Kwon, and Jeffrey LaDeur are graduates of the University of Toronto, Stanford University and the Eastman School of Music respectively, and formed the Trio while studying in the prestigious Chamber Music Program at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. They count among their mentors Henk Guittart, Bonnie Hampton, the St. Lawrence Quartet, and Stephen Prutsman, and have worked with Peter Wiley, Pedja Muzijevich, and Pamela Frank.As an ensemble, the Trio has always made food and friendship a priority and believe that these elements are at the heart of great chamber music. The ensemble is built on trust and communication; to that end, each Delphi rehearsal starts in the same way: a meal, conversation, and music.  THE CONCERT SPACEUse of the Maybeck Recital Hall was generously offered in-kind by its owners for the Delphi Trio's recording project. Maybeck Recital Hall, also known as Maybeck Studio for Performing Arts, is located inside the Kennedy-Nixon House located at 1537 Euclid Avenue in Berkeley, California, USA.

<h3>Le projet</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Video Phase</b>, c'est l'association de deux musiciens-créateurs, Julien-Robert et Julien Compagne. Nous créons des spectacles multimédia qui mélangent à la fois musique, vidéo et technologie. Le but étant de vous faire vivre une expérience nouvelle où la musique et l'image ne font qu'un. </p>
<p>Nous travaillons sur notre nouveau spectacle, <b>Lumens</b>, qui sera une véritable performance ""live"" en immersion visuelle et sonore, avec des écrans et des hauts-parleurs devant et autour du public, et un visuel 3D interactif programmé avec un logiciel de jeux vidéo.  </p>
<p>Nous sommes de la génération qui a grandi avec les jeux vidéos, la télévision et les  technologies numériques. Les spectacles que nous créons ont ces références, mais s'adressent à tout le monde. <b>Video Phase</b> s'est produit une vingtaine de fois avec son premier spectacle et espère avec <b>Lumens</b> aller encore plus loin et rejoindre un public de plus en plus nombreux.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez visionner trois extraits du futur spectacle avec <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSF_dMmtZ0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Q-Balls</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKSyUdhj6U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cube it</a>, et <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtPNAtDJcfY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roll</a>. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</h3>
<p>Bien que <b>Video Phase </b>soit habituellement autonome, nous avons besoin de vous pour nous aider à atteindre notre but final et donner vie au projet. Votre soutien nous permettra de le mener à terme, et (si possible) de faire un enregistrement professionnel de la première. Voici comment nous voulons procéder : </p>
<p><b>3000$</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">C'est le minimum dont nous avons besoin pour mener à bien notre mission. Cela  nous permettrait d'engager les collaborateurs nécessaires au projet et l'équipe technique, d'acheter le matériel nécessaire à la fabrication de nos instruments et de louer les 2 projecteurs supplémentaires qui sont nécessaires au spectacle. L'enregistrement du spectacle serait un enregistrement d'archives. Mais alors, que pourrions-nous faire avec plus? C'est là que ça devient intéressant...</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">5000$</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Voici l'objectif à atteindre! En plus de pouvoir terminer le spectacle, nous pourrions faire une promotion digne de ce nom, et une captation multi-angles de la première par un vrai réalisateur. Captation multi-angles interactive que vous recevrez alors en exclusivité! </span></p>
<p>Chaque dollar dépensé ira directement dans la production et la réalisation de <b>Lumens</b> et de son enregistrement exclusif.</p>

Le projet

Video Phase, c'est l'association de deux musiciens-créateurs, Julien-Robert et Julien Compagne. Nous créons des spectacles multimédia qui mélangent à la fois musique, vidéo et technologie. Le but étant de vous faire vivre une expérience nouvelle où la musique et l'image ne font qu'un. 
Nous travaillons sur notre nouveau spectacle, Lumens, qui sera une véritable performance ""live"" en immersion visuelle et sonore, avec des écrans et des hauts-parleurs devant et autour du public, et un visuel 3D interactif programmé avec un logiciel de jeux vidéo.  
Nous sommes de la génération qui a grandi avec les jeux vidéos, la télévision et les  technologies numériques. Les spectacles que nous créons ont ces références, mais s'adressent à tout le monde. Video Phase s'est produit une vingtaine de fois avec son premier spectacle et espère avec Lumens aller encore plus loin et rejoindre un public de plus en plus nombreux.
Vous pouvez visionner trois extraits du futur spectacle avec Q-Balls, Cube it, et Roll. 


Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez
Bien que Video Phase soit habituellement autonome, nous avons besoin de vous pour nous aider à atteindre notre but final et donner vie au projet. Votre soutien nous permettra de le mener à terme, et (si possible) de faire un enregistrement professionnel de la première. Voici comment nous voulons procéder : 
3000$

C'est le minimum dont nous avons besoin pour mener à bien notre mission. Cela  nous permettrait d'engager les collaborateurs nécessaires au projet et l'équipe technique, d'acheter le matériel nécessaire à la fabrication de nos instruments et de louer les 2 projecteurs supplémentaires qui sont nécessaires au spectacle. L'enregistrement du spectacle serait un enregistrement d'archives. Mais alors, que pourrions-nous faire avec plus? C'est là que ça devient intéressant...
5000$

Voici l'objectif à atteindre! En plus de pouvoir terminer le spectacle, nous pourrions faire une promotion digne de ce nom, et une captation multi-angles de la première par un vrai réalisateur. Captation multi-angles interactive que vous recevrez alors en exclusivité! 
Chaque dollar dépensé ira directement dans la production et la réalisation de Lumens et de son enregistrement exclusif.

The project


Video Phase is the combination of two musicians/creators, Julien-Robert and Julien Compagne. We create multimedia shows that combine music, video and technology. The purpose is to make you live a new experience where music and visual are one. 
We are now working on our new show, Lumens. It will be a real ""live"" audio/visual immersive performance, with screens and speakers surrounding the audience, and a 3D interactive visual coded with a video-game software.   
We are a generation who grew up with video-games, television and new technologies. The shows we are making are referencing to them, but are thinked for everybody. Video Phase performed his first show around twenty times et we wish with Lumens that we will go further and will reach a larger and larger audience.
you can watch three teasers of the future show with Q-Balls, Cube it and Roll. 



What we need and what you get 
Usually, Video Phase self-finance his projects, but now we need your help to reach our objectives and make Lumens come to life. With your support we will be able to complete the show, and (if possible) to make a professional recording of the premiere. Here's how we want to proceed :
3000$

That's the minimum we need to achieve our goal. With this budget, we will be able to hire the experts we need, to hire the technicians for the premiere, to buy the materials to build our virtual instruments, and to rent the 2 projectors for the show. The show recording is this scenario we be minimal. Now you're asking what we can do with more? That's where the fun begins...
5000$

That's the real target! With this budget, we will be able to promote the show and to have a professionnal multi-angle video shooting made by a real film director. You will then receive an exclusive copy of this video! 
Every single cent raised will go directly into the production of Lumens and his recording

<h3>Deanna and Jon's Campaign</h3>
<p><strong>Our Goal<br/></strong>As we enter the highly competitive world of musical performance, we need to focus as much time and energy as possible on rehearsing, voice and acting lessons, auditions and networking. In order to be fresh, remain focused and responsive to sudden opportunities we need to approach time after our campaign without the distraction of non-related work. We have savings that we are applying to the effort but that will not be sufficient. We need to develop a kind of ""fellowship"" as a supplemental financial resource to maximize our chances for success. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$5,000</strong> by <strong>January 1, 2013!</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Performing Arts?</strong><br/>After years of training, experience, and anticipation we finally get to pursue what we <em>live</em> to do: PERFORM! Communicating insights that words alone cannot is what we do. Jon and I have been deeply moved and changed through music and theater. Consequently, we will strive to move and change our audiences. We will move and change<em> you</em>. </p>
<p><strong>The Friends and Family Artist's Fellowship<br/></strong>As we have prepared to launch our careers in Minneapolis, it has become increasingly clear to us how the necessity of providing for our daily life could become a distraction in our effort to effectively acquire new roles and performance opportunities. The numerous expenses directly related to enhancing our ability to this industry will compound our already tight budget. Tending to the everyday obligations carries a large potential for compromising the success of our endeavor. <br/><br/>Traditionally, an artist fellowship or grant would be sought from various foundations and institutions. However, remembering how the love and support of our friends and family was central to the success of our development time and again over the years, we thought it important to turn once again to that source at this critical time. We are who we are because of the people we hold closest. <em>We want you to become an integral part of our effort<br/></em><br/><strong>Our Pursuit Commences</strong><br/>Currently we are seeking out musical theater productions and companies, professional choruses, liturgical music opportunities, new compositions, collaborative works, summer theaters, local festivals and concerts. I will be establishing a private voice studio with Jon as a coaching partner.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to Succeed</strong><br/>Performing is the vocation to which Jon and I have committed ourselves. We will have much better chances landing roles and gigsin this extremely competitive industry with your help. Jon and I are more than up for the challenge.</p>
<h3>Dissection of Financial Goal </h3>
<p>Your contributions will create an artist's fellowship that will help cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>$590 rent per month</li>
<li>$150 food expenses per month</li>
<li>$20-65 per week for transportation to and from auditions, lessons, rehearsals</li>
<li>$250-1,000 health insurance coverage</li>
<li>$50-65 per voice lesson for each of us weekly</li>
<li>$10-30 accompanist fees for weekly rehearsals and auditions</li>
<li>$30-75 per week for the cost of food</li>
<li>$250 recital venue rental for the recital we put on upon our fundraiser completion</li>
<li>$145 website/promotional fees </li>
</ul>
<p>Indirectly, when you contribute you will be providing us valuable time. We will use that time to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice &gt;&gt; maintain our talent and skill </li>
<li>Take lessons &gt;&gt; better our talent and skill </li>
<li>Audition &gt;&gt; offer our talent and skill </li>
<li>Rehearse &gt;&gt; apply our talent and skill </li>
<li>Perform &gt;&gt; communicate art; the ultimate goal</li>
</ul>
<h3>How You Will Benefit</h3>
<p>Jon and I appreciate any and every contribution - no matter the amount. If 100 people contribute at least $50 - we will reach our goal. The itemized list exceeds that $5,000 goal and we would love to exceed that number. However, as we are able to invest more time in auditioning, our hope is that the $5,000 will be supplemented. </p>
<p><strong>Incentives of Contributing<br/></strong>Your willingness to contribute tells us you believe in us and artists like us. To thank you for your support, here is what we will do for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1 &amp; up :</strong> We will send you personalized recordings of Jon and myself singing. You may choose between recordings of us singing show tunes, aria and art song, or both! </li>
<li>
<strong>NEW INCENTIVE! $50 &amp; up: </strong>We will write little jingle with a message in it JUST FOR YOU! It will be fun and hopefully make you smile. </li>
<li>
<strong>$100 &amp; up:</strong> In addition to the basic incentive, you may request 3 songs that we will also record for you. If we are in your area, we can also offer to perform 3 songs of your choosing at an event.</li>
<li>
<strong>$500 &amp; up:</strong> On top of the perks just listed, Jon and I will put on a concert or cabaret in your honor depending on when we are in your area. </li>
<li>Check in regularly to our website <a href=""http://www.dnjmeetminneapolis.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>dnjmeetminneapolis.com</strong></a> to keep up with our journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jon and I have appreciated the jobs we have worked outside of music and theater. We have each gained an excellent sense of work ethic and people skills which we will apply to our careers. Even if we do not reach our entire goal, the contribution you make will still allow us to focus more on singing and acting.</p>
<h3>How Everyone Will Benefit</h3>
<p>A large portion of talented and skilled artists struggle to survive. When you donate to our cause - you are donating to the arts. Not only do you believe that art belongs in the world, but you agree that the level of quality is even more important. The financial aspect is appreciated. The thought behind the contribution is equally appreciated. <br/><br/>Jon and I have already been hired professionally in cities around the U.S. and know this is not a far-fetched goal. When you contribute, you stand behind us and help to push us forward. We will seize every opportunity we can. Jon and I are reliable performers and markedly skilled. We love the music you love. We love the theater you love.</p>
<h3>If You Cannot Donate</h3>
<p>We understand if you are not able to make a monetary contribution. You may still help if you wish! Here are a few ways you may forward our cause:</p>
<p>1. Spread the word about this campaign to create our artist's fellowship! Your words <em>are extremely </em>valuable.</p>
<p>2. We will accept gifts in kind such as:<br/>         -Recording equipment like a digital recorder, microphone, and editing software.</p>
<p>         -Help or service with our websites and publicity.  </p>
<p>3. Connect us with folks you know in the music and theater scene in Minneapolis and St. Paul! Networking will be huge for us.            </p>

<p><font size=""4"">Because
singing is a fundamental part of being a human being.  EVERYBODY should
sing.  (And not just in the shower.)  Studies have proven that
singing develops brainpower in children and prevents dementia (including
Alzheimer's) in adults.  It turns out that we all NEED to sing! </font></p>
<font size=""4"">
<p><font size=""4"">Schools
have been cutting music programs, so many of our kids have no place to learn
music or to sing.  Adults are also looking for somewhere to sing. </font></p>
<font size=""4"">
<p><font size=""4"">That's
where we come in.  We hold open auditions every year, and we agree to
train anybody from age 7 on up who can sing in tune and who is willing to work
hard, commit to a rigorous rehearsal schedule, and share the ecstasy of experiencing
the world's greatest choral music with the community.  There is just no
other experience like it. </font></p>
<font size=""4"">
<p><font size=""4"">We
love all kinds of singing, but our niche is sacred choral music.  We sing
at the university level, and we don't ""dumb it down"" for the
choirboys and choirgirls who are our trebles.  This is not a children's

The Hawai'i Sacred Choir is under the 501(c)(3) umbrella organization, the Pacific American Foundation, a verified
non-profit corporation with the IRS, so your money is 100%
tax-deductible. 

We
have sung our hearts out for three years, now going into our fourth concert
year.  We've supported ourselves with membership dues and donations from
the community.  We've produced three live concert DVDs and our video
""A Hawaiian Hallelujah.""  (See “Resources” page or YouTube--Yes,
that's actually us singing the audio!)

We
model our choir after the King's College Choir from Cambridge, UK. 
People worldwide watch them, especially at Christmas.  We sing the same
university-level music—even our 8-year-old choirboy and choirgirl trebles!

England is the ""Holy Grail"" of
choirs worldwide.  The highest achievement a choir can attain is to sing
in a top English Cathedral.  We sent an audition recording last year to
Ely Cathedral, the 7th-longest cathedral in the world—longer than Westminster
Abbey!  Our audition was approved, and we were invited to be their
""Choir in Residence"" for one week taking over their choir duties from
July 5 to 15, 2014.  We are
officially on their calendar. 

We
are established with Richardson and Gray,
 UK choir tour
specialists, and we have already made deposits to them and to United Airlines
for the choir's expenses. 

So
we've put it out there.  We believe in ourselves.  We're on Ely's
calendar, we're putting in hours every week learning the music, and we've
plunked down our deposits.  At this point we've got everything covered but
the balance of the tour money.  Now we must raise $160,000 in order to
finish paying for our tour.  Whatever you give is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. 
And if you donate now, you can claim the deduction on your 2013 taxes!

Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!  I’m very excited about moving forward toward making a long-time dream a
reality. And with your help, I can do just that!</p>
<p>I feel so fortunate to have enjoyed many years in the professional operatic world and one of the great blessings of my life was the
creation of a documentary film called <i>Laundry
and Tosca</i> that chronicled my calling to sing.  <i>Laundry
and Tosca</i> has been seen around the world and I was deeply blessed to
receive an award for my vocal work in the film in Milan, Italy. 
</p>
<p>I would never have guessed that another adventure awaiting
me would be using my voice for ministry. I've traveled to numerous locations the United States and recently up into Canada presenting
Embraced by God, a ministry program born out of the film that <span>honestly addresses the pain of dying to
self in order to bend to the will of God, allowing God to reshape and redefine
our desires and the amazingly abundant life that can result. I continue to be incredibly grateful and humbled
by how deeply the presentation resonates with people. </span></p><p><span>I invite you to visit my website, <a href=""http://marciawhiteheadusa.com/biography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://marciawhiteheadusa.com/biography/</a>  to learn a bit more about my background and the Embraced by God page,  <a href=""http://marciawhiteheadusa.com/embraced-by-god/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://marciawhiteheadusa.com/embraced-by-god/</a> to hear me sing music that has been particularly meaningful to me, including Give Me Jesus and an aria from the opera, Turandot.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As I travel, people tell me they would love to take
home a CD that contains songs from the program including You’ll Never Walk
Alone, The Lord’s Prayer and Give Me Jesus, and are very surprised
that I don’t already have a CD to offer them. 
I’ve always wanted to make sure that any recording project I take on is a
very high quality studio recording and funding a project like that has always
been outside my means.</span></p>
<p>One of my favorite words is “collaboration,” which
is probably why I loved working in the operatic field so much. One certainly
can’t do opera alone!  So I’m very
excited that Indiegogo has offered me the opportunity to invite you to partner
with me in ministry and collaborate in creating my first extended play CD that
will be entitled Give Me Jesus.  </p>
<p>Recording dates have been set for January 11-14,
2014 in Southern California and the CD will be available by late March.  I'm working with a producer I’ve known for
years and trust implicitly and the funds needed for this project include: </p>
<p>Studio, engineer, mixing and mastering
fees: $3,600.00 </p>
<p>Producer, arranger, musician fees:  $2,500.00</p>
<p>Recording rights:  $900.00  </p>
<p>Album photography: $600.00</p>
<p>Album artwork, design and layout:  $500.00</p>
<p>Duplication for 1,000 CDs: $975.00</p>
<p>Airfare, lodging, rental car etc: $700.00</p>
<p>Any

Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!  I’m very excited about moving forward toward making a long-time dream a
reality. And with your help, I can do just that!
I feel so fortunate to have enjoyed many years in the professional operatic world and one of the great blessings of my life was the
creation of a documentary film called Laundry
and Tosca that chronicled my calling to sing.  Laundry
and Tosca has been seen around the world and I was deeply blessed to
receive an award for my vocal work in the film in Milan, Italy. 

I would never have guessed that another adventure awaiting
me would be using my voice for ministry. I've traveled to numerous locations the United States and recently up into Canada presenting
Embraced by God, a ministry program born out of the film that honestly addresses the pain of dying to
self in order to bend to the will of God, allowing God to reshape and redefine
our desires and the amazingly abundant life that can result. I continue to be incredibly grateful and humbled
by how deeply the presentation resonates with people. I invite you to visit my website, http://marciawhiteheadusa.com/biography/  to learn a bit more about my background and the Embraced by God page,  http://marciawhiteheadusa.com/embraced-by-god/ to hear me sing music that has been particularly meaningful to me, including Give Me Jesus and an aria from the opera, Turandot.As I travel, people tell me they would love to take
home a CD that contains songs from the program including You’ll Never Walk
Alone, The Lord’s Prayer and Give Me Jesus, and are very surprised
that I don’t already have a CD to offer them. 
I’ve always wanted to make sure that any recording project I take on is a
very high quality studio recording and funding a project like that has always
been outside my means.
One of my favorite words is “collaboration,” which
is probably why I loved working in the operatic field so much. One certainly
can’t do opera alone!  So I’m very
excited that Indiegogo has offered me the opportunity to invite you to partner
with me in ministry and collaborate in creating my first extended play CD that
will be entitled Give Me Jesus.  
Recording dates have been set for January 11-14,
2014 in Southern California and the CD will be available by late March.  I'm working with a producer I’ve known for
years and trust implicitly and the funds needed for this project include: 
Studio, engineer, mixing and mastering
fees: $3,600.00 
Producer, arranger, musician fees:  $2,500.00
Recording rights:  $900.00  
Album photography: $600.00
Album artwork, design and layout:  $500.00
Duplication for 1,000 CDs: $975.00
Airfare, lodging, rental car etc: $700.00
Any
funds raised over the total stated will be used for other needs like additional recording rights, packaging and shipping costs, photo session make-up artist, etc.

praying that the ground would form itself under his feet, I’m asking if you
would prayerfully consider partnering with me in this new adventure and

This funding will help me finish what I have just started. I started out and currently just doing Solo Acoustic Singer/Songwriter styles, but this EP will have the sound of a full band behind me and a great up-beat and rockin' style which I'm excited to see the finished product of... but that's not going to happen without some help from you...</p>
<p><br/>This is the first professional recording project I've taken on and I'm excited to hear what we've done getting started, but now its time to run to the finish. Your contributions and perks go 100% to helping me fund the remaining costs of the studio and production time/efforts.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Simply put, you can donate by clicking on one of the ""perk"" options that you have an interest in. My goal is to raise $1,200. This pays for the remaining studio time and work needed to finish the EP as well as paying Indiegogo's fee of Crowd Funding this.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal, the funds received will go as far as I can take them in trying to finish the project in the future when I can raise enough funds to finish it. But let's not let that happen!</p>
<p>I've got some great PERKS you can see to purchase that will help reach my goal and also provide some fun and entertainment for you,</p>
</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to help, I understand. None of us are made of money and we've all seen our own ups and downs in life.

But thank you in advance for at least sharing this project and helping me reach my goal.<br/></p>
</div></div>","Short Summary I've written and played for over a decade but never really recorded professionally. This funding will help me finish what I have just started. I started out and currently just doing Solo Acoustic Singer/Songwriter styles, but this EP will have the sound of a full band behind me and a great up-beat and rockin' style which I'm excited to see the finished product of... but that's not going to happen without some help from you...
This is the first professional recording project I've taken on and I'm excited to hear what we've done getting started, but now its time to run to the finish. Your contributions and perks go 100% to helping me fund the remaining costs of the studio and production time/efforts.

  What We Need & What You Get Simply put, you can donate by clicking on one of the ""perk"" options that you have an interest in. My goal is to raise $1,200. This pays for the remaining studio time and work needed to finish the EP as well as paying Indiegogo's fee of Crowd Funding this.
If I don't reach the entire goal, the funds received will go as far as I can take them in trying to finish the project in the future when I can raise enough funds to finish it. But let's not let that happen!
I've got some great PERKS you can see to purchase that will help reach my goal and also provide some fun and entertainment for you,


  Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to help, I understand. None of us are made of money and we've all seen our own ups and downs in life. If you can't contribute, please do me a solid and at least share this with your friends and family. Maybe they can contribute $5 or $10... or more if they want.

<h3>Thanks for checking out our Indiegogo page</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are Susan Levine and Doug Kwartler, two singer-songwriters who have
recently come together to form the duo The Lied To's.  We are asking
for your help to fund the production and promotion of our debut cd.  </p>
<p>We are sure you have seen many crowd funding campaigns for musicians in the
last couple of years.  As you may know, the music industry has
changed a lot in the past decade and in some ways it's easier for songwriters to
get their songs out to the people, but in many ways it's a lot harder to make a
living at it.</p>
<p>So what we and other musicians are doing is asking our fans to help advance
funds to us in exchange for perks and products like cds,
posters, concerts, credits in liners notes and/or other great rewards
(which you'll see here in our campaign).</p>
<p>Both of us have had some cool accomplishments in the past in our solo
careers.  Susan has won songwriter awards and has played at some of the most
prestigious music festivals across the country and Doug has had song
placements on major network tv shows and has also played at top venues
around the country. Just a few weeks ago, The Lied
To's played a show to a full house at the legendary Bluebird
Café in Nashville, TN.  We have received excellent feedback and feel
there's a buzz growing around our duo!</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign and others like ours, you will not only help us continue to create
music for you, but you are also helping to put music and art out
into the world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $6,000.  Fortunately, Doug is a music producer with a studio just outside of Boston, so our recording needs will be taken care of at his Hollow Body Studios.  But we still need to raise money for the following:</p>
<p>PERKS:</p>
<p>Duplication, radio promotion, publicity/advertising and touring in support
of the record.  </p>
<p>So...some of the perks we are offering are things like:</p>
<p>Autographed copies of our cd<br/>
Tickets to our big cd release show at Club Passim in Cambridge, MA<br/>
A concert in your home<br/>Recording time at Doug's ""Hollow Body Studios""<br/><br/>and more.  (see the perks list!)<br/><br/><br/></p>

I suffered from love lost, experienced the joy of new love found, taken countless road trips, adopted a new fur baby, became reunited with my best friend, enjoyed an inspirational cowrite on a rooftop in New York City, and found myself and my life's purpose. During those 3 years I wasn't always inspired by my music, and I agonized over prolonged writer's block. And then... it all came flooding to me in a dream.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This new album, Mind Games, is me. It's my life over the last 3 years. It's that place inside where my true self was hiding.  Every heartache, every epiphany I've had... it's right here in this project.  Words can't describe, and I can hardly contain, my excitement to share it with the world, but I need your help. I know many of you have been with me from the very beginning, watching me grow, and offering your love and support, your kind words asking when and how you can help. Here is your chance. I need your help to bring this project to a resolution, and, ultimately, to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am currently in the studio, nearly halfway through this project. Some of you may remember the release date was initially October. Then it was November. Then it was December. Now it's just seemingly interminable. My previous album was recorded in a living room with virtually zero overhead, so to be quite honest, I had no idea what I was getting into trying to pursue a professionally produced album. It seems every little obstacle that can rear its ugly head finds its way to me and this album.  However, each little bump in the road is a blessing in disguise (see what I did there?), as it provides checks and balances to keep my head on straight during this process, and serves as a reminder not to over do it. Nonetheless, I have had to keep pushing the release further and further back, and my funds are dwindling as a result.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ever-present paradox of recording is that the less money you have, the longer it takes. Meanwhile, the longer it takes, the more money it costs! I'm asking those of you who can, to please be an active part in the creation of this vision, so that it no longer has to be put on hold or drawn out and kept from you.</p>
<p>Here is how your generous contributions will be applied to this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing/Mastering</li>
<li>The Remainder of My Studio Time</li>
<li>Remainder of Compensation for Studio Musicians</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Album Art and Design</li>
<li>Disc Pressing/Packaging</li>
<li>Promotional Material (Posters, stickers, T-shirts, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>My goal is to release this album in the spring of 2013 at the very latest, which leaves me only a few months to get this together. With your help, it CAN be done! To make it worth your while, I have included some great perks for you to claim in return for your contributions!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who is already involved in the creation of this album, and to those of you who will be involved by making your generous contributions!</p>
<p>For those who cannot help financially, you can help by spreading the word to others who may be interested in supporting independent music!</p>
<p>I am so, so excited to share this piece of my soul with you, and I could never do what I do without the love and support that you all bestow upon me! I love you all!</p>

<p>KJazz 88.1 FM needs your help to <em>Save Our Jazz </em>in our local schools near the Long Beach, CA area.  KJazz is kicking off the program with two student music concerts to benefit, support and extend music programs in and outside the classroom. Student groups from <strong>Oak Middle School, Woodrow Wilson Classical High School, JazzAngels,</strong> and the Jazz Studies Program at <strong>Cal State Long Beach</strong> will be performing at this 2-part concert series.</p>
<p>KJazz would like to invite local schools and student jazz groups to showcase their musical talents at the first annual KJazz <em>Save Our Jazz </em>Festival.</p>
<ul>
<li>This 2-part special concert series will take place at KDB in Long Beach on February 17th and 24th, 2013 and offer opportunities for students and families to play, learn, share and inspire. </li>
<li>Every $ we raise after we reach $2,500 will be donated to the school programs and proceeds from all tickets sold by the schools will go directly to their music programs!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are using Indigogo to get the word out to help fund this amazing student concert series and to help cover venue rental, staffing, production costs, and local marketing.</p>
<p>Our objective for <em>Save Our Jazz </em>is to educate, inspire and develop new musicians, by giving them a place to showcase their talents.  As music programs are dwindling in schools, it is crucial that we find ways to develop the talent of young jazz musicians. With the help of individuals, foundations, and corporations, we hope to provide an opportunity for our youth to express their talents and encourage artistic growth both as an individual and as a group.  These student concerts will not only offer young musicians the encouragement they need, but also the financial resources necessary for their programs to continue.  </p>
<p>Education programs are facing budget cutbacks across the country, raising concerns about support for school music programs. Thank you for your help with this special project and we hope to create a summer series to support more schools in our area (with your help)!</p>

If you are an artist, a musician, a graphic designer, a photographer, a painter, a film maker, a writer, a poet, etc; if your passion is simply listening to music or discovering new art, spreading the word about new music, connecting people, helping others in need, serving your community, then welcome to <em>Schematic</em>. <em>Schematic</em> is the community of artists, creatives, musicians, and people who simply enjoy connection through relationship and rely on each other to fulfill each others needs. In short, <em>Schematic</em> is meant to be a microcosm within the music and art industry that relies on grassroots growth through community.</p>
<p>Schematic will operate on four pillars:</p>
<p><strong>Schematic Studios</strong></p>
<p><strong>Schematic Records</strong></p>
<p><strong>Schematic Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>&amp;</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Schematic Community</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The <em>Schematic Community</em> will be a public web based application where artists will find their audience and build a network of opportunities for development.  The Community will facilitate a new relationship between the artist and the audience as well as connect artists together.  It will be opportunity for music fans to find new music and champion it with tools we can provide.</p>
<p>This indiegogo campaign is our attempt to raise funds in order to build a new type of community for emerging artists to reach their new audience, the Schematic Community.</p>
<p>I moved to Nashville back in January of 2011 for a specific reason. After spending almost 10 years in the trenches with my bandmates</p>
<p><img alt=""Mae"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8183/8097993990_8ed98e49e9_b.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mae""/><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/mae</a></p>
<p>my interest for the music business and it's future grew and I decided to place myself in the center of Music City.  I wanted to learn and grow in this business being in the thick of the landscape.  I wanted to be part of change the industry is both resisting and birthing and watch the control fall back into the hands of the artists and the creators.  If I had the chance to be one of the factors behind this change, nothing would make me more fulfilled.</p>
<p>Since moving here, I have built my studio, produced several artists and records, begun managing a few bands, and launched <em>Schematic Records</em>. </p>
<p>I've also been putting together an idea for a web application that will service the needs of the emerging artist, help manage the business aspects easily, and facilitate the relationship between the artist and the audience all culminating to 360 degrees of artist development, <em><strong>not</strong></em> taking 360 degrees of an artist's income!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/11/24/131574836/you-ask-we-answer-what-exactly-is-a-360-deal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/11/24/131574836/you-ask-we-answer-what-exactly-is-a-360-deal</a></p>
<p>This app also finds a new way to get music from emerging artists into the ears and hands of a community looking for new music, new art, new creativity, and new opportunity.  </p>
<p>I've partnered with young web designers who believe in <em>Schematic</em>'s vision and have taken the vision as far as it can go. </p>
<p>It is now time to design, create, and facilitate the <em>Schematic Community</em>.</p>
<p>Amanda Palmer was right when she said, ""This is the future of music,"" and that ""We are the media.""  </p>
<p>With crowdfunding methods, social networking tools, and media platforms from PledgeMusic to ReverbNation, the opportunities for DIY artists to create something, set a goal, and connect directly to their audience is quickly taking over the music business model.  So it is possible for more artists to turn their creativity into a physical/digital product that can be shared/distributed with it's base.</p>
<p>Yet there are plenty of 360 deals being signed, royalties keep finding their way into the wrong pockets, and the shelf life of the aspiring artist gets shorter and shorter.  </p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>You can generally go one of two ways: </p>
<p>Search for that label deal, the criminal contract where you give a high percentage of all net profits away, take an advance on an incredibly high interest loan, sell your rights away, and cross your fingers hoping for success before the label implodes or simply gives up on your project.  </p>
<p>Or you could finance the creation of your artwork by yourself with the help of your fanbase, spend the budget you grow together on creating, packaging, and shipping your product, own your rights, but then what?!  <br/>Too often, the momentum stops soon after you've accomplished your creative goal, but before you've really hit the streets promoting and marketing your brand and your product. Artists raise just enough money to create their art but not enough to market it and grow their fanbase.</p>
<p>At least when you sign one of those god-awful deals, with one of those faceless labels, your music, your art, your brand, gets pumped into a machine where hundreds of projects are marketed every year.  Sure, you could get lost in the shuffle, especially if you're not generating the kind of income to keep ""the machine's"" attention, but at least contractually, you have some attention.  You just had to give away about 80-90% of the income that will be made off of your art away to get that attention.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Great Divide"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/8097985225_720785f725.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Great Divide""/></p>
<p>So essentially both options have their drawbacks.  </p>
<p>Own your rights but take on the responsibility of marketing, distribution and business or sell your rights, cross your fingers, hope for the best and work for peanuts.</p>
<p>But with the <em>Schematic Community</em>, you will finally get the perks of the independent artist and the strengths of a label and marketing team.</p>
<p>We already have established <em>Schematic Studios, Schematic Records, &amp; Schematic Management &amp; Mentoring.  </em></p>
<p>The next step is to create the <em>Schematic Community</em>.  </p>
<p><em>Schematic</em> Artists will always retain ownership of their artwork as<em> Schematic</em> only licenses products from their artists allowing them to profit from their creations over a lifetime.  This provides an opportunity for artists to build careers off of their creativity not flashes in a pan. </p>
<p><em>Schematic Management</em> will not take commissions off of gross percentage but rather net receipts. This simply means that if you aren't profiting, neither is <em>Schematic Management</em>.</p>
<p>These are just two of the fundamentals <em>Schematic</em> operates on.</p>
<p><em>Schematic</em> is a <strong>BIG</strong> idea!</p>
<p>So throughout this campaign, I will be answering questions, explaining the mission of <em>Schematic</em> in greater detail, sharing stories of my experience in the music industry, and giving you an opportunity to share your thoughts, stories, and opinions.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds like a good idea to you, if you would like to help build the <em>Schematic Community</em>, thank you! Your donation will go much further than the making of one record or one product. You will help create an opportunity to give emerging artists the chance to build their creativity, talent, and dreams into a career with longevity and not just a quick 15 minutes of fame.</p>
<p>If you are only interested in getting new music from <em>""The guy from MAE,"" </em>that will work too! I've been writing, recording, and producing new music for the last two years and have been waiting for this moment and this platform to share it with you! Check out my new song, ""Stand"" right here:</p>

<p>My new EP, Fluorescent is done and yours to listen to. I am now working on a full length album called, Color (n.) Inside The Lines. I'll do my best to finish this music before the end of 2012.

My name is Dave Elkins and I am the creator of Schematic.

my interest for the music business and it's future grew and I decided to place myself in the center of Music City.  I wanted to learn and grow in this business being in the thick of the landscape.  I wanted to be part of change the industry is both resisting and birthing and watch the control fall back into the hands of the artists and the creators.  If I had the chance to be one of the factors behind this change, nothing would make me more fulfilled.
Since moving here, I have built my studio, produced several artists and records, begun managing a few bands, and launched Schematic Records. 
I've also been putting together an idea for a web application that will service the needs of the emerging artist, help manage the business aspects easily, and facilitate the relationship between the artist and the audience all culminating to 360 degrees of artist development, not taking 360 degrees of an artist's income!

It is also very much needed since there is no such thing as a queer feminist label in Sweden, maybe not even a label that is calling themselves feminist in the first breath. </p><p>The record It is going to be available on a wonderful, touchable 7 inch vinyl, and also digitally because we're <i>that</i> tech savvy..</p><p><b><br/>What?</b><br/></p><ul>
<li>35 days to raise $1100<br/>
</li>
<li>Two bad ass queer punk bands, each get one side of the vinyl<br/>
</li>
<li>""Abolish Straightcore"" – 250 physical copies to start</li>
<li>Great cover art, ear blasting political music and an extensive insert with lyrics and other goodies</li>
</ul><p><b>Why?</b><br/></p><ul>
<li>To help spread queer punk, that has little space in the punk scene in Sweden</li>
<li>Be a part of creating community for queer punx, in Sweden, all over Europe and the world</li>
<li>The best alternative to capitalism you'll find</li>
<li>We will love you forever<br/>
</li>
</ul><p><br/>Maybe you've already made up your mind, but if you want us to persuade you even more, just keep reading!<br/><br/><i>(Please note that the long version can go on for hours, though we don't mind telling it please get in touch!)<br/></i><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We like lists, here's some more facts:<br/></p><ul>
<li>We need $1100 for the pressing of the record, this is done in the Czech Republic at a little DIY vinyl pressing place that we found (that's unsupportive to oppressive shit). All the money is going to the payment of 250 copies, and to start off the printing of the insert that we make and print ourselves. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach the goal of $1100 we get the money that you give, every dollar/euro/svensk krona is important! We have some money but we need your help.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Apart from the joy of helping out to fund this life-changing project, 
you get eternal love and awesome perks --including the record, our second (re-)release of Canadian band Eekum Seekum's sold out ""Glitterbomb"", a zine, a mix of patches from our distro and more! <i>(check out the list to the right)</i><br/><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p><b>""Why is it important to have a queer feminist record label, and release a record?"" you might ask.</b><br/>Well, making music is a very powerful way of expressing oneself, playing and showing it to others are a way of creating community that sometimes even saves lives. This is no joke. <br/><br/>As gender-non-conforming people we know that A LOT of us are subject to discrimination and violence in our daily life. One could, without risking much, even argue that all of us have experienced the one or the other, or even both, at least once (but probably more than once). <br/><br/><i><b>Having community help us survive. Sharing our stories help us survive. Saving our stories on records help future queers survive. </b></i><br/><br/>Getting queer punk recorded and released help this process of community building/story sharing/hirstory creating. Having fellow queers and feminists doing this is crucial to even dare to think about making it reality. <br/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>A poor queer just like us? You can still help!<br/>

We believe that dreams are meant to be followed even if you're poor and that is why we started the record label --it's our dream. It is also very much needed since there is no such thing as a queer feminist label in Sweden, maybe not even a label that is calling themselves feminist in the first breath. The record It is going to be available on a wonderful, touchable 7 inch vinyl, and also digitally because we're that tech savvy..What?
35 days to raise $1100

Two bad ass queer punk bands, each get one side of the vinyl

""Abolish Straightcore"" – 250 physical copies to start
Great cover art, ear blasting political music and an extensive insert with lyrics and other goodies
Why?
To help spread queer punk, that has little space in the punk scene in Sweden
Be a part of creating community for queer punx, in Sweden, all over Europe and the world
The best alternative to capitalism you'll find
We will love you forever

Maybe you've already made up your mind, but if you want us to persuade you even more, just keep reading!(Please note that the long version can go on for hours, though we don't mind telling it please get in touch!)What We Need & What You GetWe like lists, here's some more facts:
We need $1100 for the pressing of the record, this is done in the Czech Republic at a little DIY vinyl pressing place that we found (that's unsupportive to oppressive shit). All the money is going to the payment of 250 copies, and to start off the printing of the insert that we make and print ourselves. 

Even if we don't reach the goal of $1100 we get the money that you give, every dollar/euro/svensk krona is important! We have some money but we need your help.

Apart from the joy of helping out to fund this life-changing project, 
you get eternal love and awesome perks --including the record, our second (re-)release of Canadian band Eekum Seekum's sold out ""Glitterbomb"", a zine, a mix of patches from our distro and more! (check out the list to the right)

The Impact""Why is it important to have a queer feminist record label, and release a record?"" you might ask.Well, making music is a very powerful way of expressing oneself, playing and showing it to others are a way of creating community that sometimes even saves lives. This is no joke. As gender-non-conforming people we know that A LOT of us are subject to discrimination and violence in our daily life. One could, without risking much, even argue that all of us have experienced the one or the other, or even both, at least once (but probably more than once). Having community help us survive. Sharing our stories help us survive. Saving our stories on records help future queers survive. Getting queer punk recorded and released help this process of community building/story sharing/hirstory creating. Having fellow queers and feminists doing this is crucial to even dare to think about making it reality. A poor queer just like us? You can still help!
We understand that some of you that agree that this is an important project just can’t contribute with money, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Here are some ideas:

Make some noise! Share this fundraiser online on social media (you know facebook/tumblr/twitter/grindr/wherever you are). This means a lot!

Talk about it with your friends and in your zine!

Start your own band!

Start your own label!

After feats such as performing for President Clinton in the White House, taking the state at Carnegie Hall, and bringing our music to London in 2012, we want to start 2014 off the Derby way with a trip to Europe--but we need your help!The ImpactThe Derbies are taking their music to Europe! We are always looking for ways to spread the Derby love. Whether we are workshopping with choral students at an international school in Amsterdam or singing in the streets of London, we just want to add a little more music in everyone's lives. What We Need & What You GetWhile a trip to Europe will be amazing, we need your help to make it happen. The costs of flights and housing in Europe are very high and we need all the help we can get. In return you get different perks to show off your Derby love! Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word about our tour!

Voice over IP (VoIP) was developed in order to provide the voice communication around the world. In most places, voice communication is quite costly.And don't have better video quality for video calls but very expensive or had limitations. Consider making a phone call to a person living in a country half the globe away. The first thing you think of in this case is your phone bill! VoIP solves this problem and many others.


Save your money begin with gloodzz freedom
If you don’t use VoIP for voice communication, then you are most certainly using the good old phone line (PSTN – Packet-Switched Telephone Network). On a PSTN line, time is really money. You actually pay for each minute you spend communicating on the phone. International calls are much more expensive. Since VoIP uses the Internet as backbone, the only cost you have when using it is the monthly Internet bill to your Internet Service Provider.But with Gloodzz, You are free to use the service with high quality free features. And you can optimize your internet speed, bandwidth with Gloodzz and reduce your monthly internet bills, this was one of most headache had for the most of VoIP users, cause the VoIP software eats lot of Mega bytes from your Internet package and you don't have any option to control your bandwidth while you are calling. That's why Gloodzz came as a solution to give you all controls of the service.



More than two persons, Free Life Time HD support with Bandwidth control, Listen & Share your voice.
On the phone line, only two persons can speak at a time. With VoIP, you can setup a conference with a whole team communicating in real time.But today most of voIP service providers charge a fee from the users for conversasion with multiple people, and charge for HD calls, They only give very low quality service for free. Thats why gloodzz comes with totally free rich features.Gloodzz is the only solution to reduce your internet bill controlling the internet speed while you are calling.
gloodzz gives you the most useful features for free. Spend Your Time For Useful Things.
Put simply, Quality of Service (QoS) in VoIP is the level of ‘quality’ offered by the VoIP service to place calls in a decent way. QoS varies according to technology. What I call good QoS for VoIP is the strict that can allow you to make a decent call without suffering from delays,weird sounds, noise and echo. You want to converse just like you would over a landline phone.But today all these features are only available for users who can pay for the services. Gloodzz will give you the all features free to feel your freedom.High quality music play stations. HD  broadcasting stations will be available with Gloodzz.

<h3>About Mark and the project:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493991699/s9kkxiralmi9pfipgycn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I've been making music for a <strong>very</strong> long time.  (My first studio gig was in 1967, at age 5 - a spoken word part on a single that actually got released. )</p>
<p>I've made music of all kinds... Folk, Rock, Blues, Punk, Techno, Long-form instrumental and more. I've sung or played on albums and projects by a whole boatload of other folks, and even released some of my own stuff, which was very well received<strong>*</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, my <strong>Born Wired </strong>album is here.  I have devoted five years and much effort towards it, and it's the <strong>best</strong> rock and roll I've ever made - so I'm putting the same effort into making sure it really gets out there. </p>
<p>That's not just important for <strong>this</strong> album - but <strong>also</strong> for the music I make in the future  (I already have <strong>two</strong> other albums underway!)</p>
</div><hr/><div>
<h3>What I Need To Make This Happen...</h3>
<p>Making an album is more than just playing, recording and mixing.  There are a whole bunch of other costs involved, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing, printing, shrink-wrap and delivery of the actual discs and booklets</li>
<li>Digital distribution, so folks can get the album from the major online services</li>
<li>Promotion (to get the word out to podcasts, magazines, music blogs and websites), licensing (there are three cover songs on the album that have to be licensed) and copyrighting</li>
<li>Merchandise and shipping</li>
<li>Making a second, and possibly third, video to promote the album. (I've already made one video on my own dime, which will be released shortly before the album actually comes out.) </li>
</ul>
<p>I have shopped around to get the highest quality at the most reasonable price for each of these items, including shopping locally whenever possible. <br/><br/>The cost to accomplish all of this is $5000.00.  Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493907262/shj0x75oprqfhclhaxht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What You'll Get!</h3>
<p>For me, the neatest part (besides getting it out there) is the things I get to share with <strong>you </strong>as part of this campaign.  I designed most every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>The Born Wired album</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493999686/o0bpn7xbxt7vbhxcsogn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you get the digital download, you'll get some great music, a PDF of the artwork and booklet, and a little piece of my heart. If you get the CD, you'll get the album with an 8-page color booklet <strong>and</strong> a digital download.</p>

<p>This shirt is so cool that I can't wait to get one myself!  It's a <strong>very</strong> high-quality Gildan brand shirt with a big <strong>Born Wired</strong> logo on it, printed right here at <strong>Antilogy</strong> in Kingston, NY.</p>

<p>Well, they're starting to make guitar strings as well, and they've kindly offered to make a very limited-edition <strong>Born Wired</strong> set of guitar strings just for this campaign - and I get to design the packages!  I'm very touched that they believe in me that much. <br/>So you can get either the bass or the guitar strings - or <strong>both</strong>.</p>

<p>No kidding.  I custom ordered my own picks - they are lightweight picks, which help me prevent breaking strings when I play live (I used to break a <strong>lot</strong> of 'em 'til I switched.)</p>

<p><strong>Seriously.</strong>  This isn't a cheap copy I bought to give away for this campaign - it's <strong>really</strong> one of the guitars I used to make the album.  It's a deep blue first-generation <strong>Fender Squier Stagemaster</strong>, with a reverse headstock and a locking Floyd Rose tremelo - they are pretty hard to find (I searched for it for about 6 months before finding it), and even when you do, they don't all play nicely, and some have been beaten pretty badly.  This one plays like a <strong>dream</strong>, and one lucky person will get to live with it. <br/><br/>I'll be just a little sad to say goodbye to it, but <strong>more</strong> than happy to see it go to someone who is willing to help me make all this happen.<br/><br/>(FYI - the marks on the body in that picture are sweat and finger oil, and have since been removed.  I'll be happy to put some back for whomever gets it, if desired.)</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Deliverable dates:</strong></h3>
<p>The New Jersey plant where I'm getting the CDs made has a three-week turnaround, which doesn't include shipping time to me, <strong>or</strong> shipping time from me to you.  So the items will be delivered to contributors within 5 weeks of the end of the campaign!</p>
<h3><strong>If I don't meet my goal:</strong></h3>
<p>Now if I don't meet my goal, I'll <strong>still</strong> get whatever funds are raised.  If that happens, I'll restructure the budget to order smaller amounts where necessary, and re-budget the promotional and video costs as well.  But <strong>I am getting this album out there.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help (besides contributing!)</h3>
<p>I need help getting the word out. If you could share this campaign on Facebook, on Twitter or with friends, it'd go a long way towards achieving my goal - to <strong>make more music</strong>!  You can use the Indiegogo sharing tools on the top right hand corner of this page (the circles right underneath the amount raised) to do that!</p>

<h3>Our History and Vision</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.elenalosfulanos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elena &amp; Los Fulanos</a> is a bilingual folk rock band based in Washington, DC since 2011. Influenced by front-woman Elena Lacayo’s experience growing up in two cultures (Nicaraguan and American) we make music that ranges from twangy, heartbreak-themed folk Americana, to soothing, introspective, violin-infused Latin rock. Thanks to the generous support of people like you, we were able to release our first album (Miel Venenosa) in 2014 which earned a Washington Area Music Association (WAMMIE) nomination for Best Latin Recording! Since then we've toured Nicaragua (Elena's home country) and the US and played some amazing shows including the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ4rIY8P0no"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage</a> in November!!! </p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m proud to introduce you to my new musical project!</p>
<p>I’ve just written 7 new pieces for string quartet and saxophone, illustrating the 7 imaginary worlds of the Japanese Butoh dance.</p>
<p>The recording in studio will take place at the Bunker Studio in Brooklyn on September 26th.</p>
<p>Then, we will be premiering this project “Magma” at the Triad Theatre in Manhattan on October 4th.</p>
<p>This show will combine music and dance. Indeed, a Butoh dancer will be illustrating with dance the music played live.</p>
<p>I am allowing myself to ask for your help to finance this project: to pay the musicians, the dancer, the recording studio and the production of the record.</p>
<p>I hope you will be sensitive at my request and, to thank you, I will send you a copy of the record as well as a ticket to attend the show on October the 4th at the Triad Theatre or at one of the shows during the European tour I dream about organizing in 2017.</p>

<p>Reno has been playing country blues and rockabilly for over four decades most notably as a bass player and band leader for many bands including The Jack Family, Handsome Ned and most recently partnering with Sunday. Reno's debut album titled Lightnight Fried hit the top ten Mexico.</p>
<p>So we are ON tour in January leaving Northern Ontario and heading to Ottawa, Montreal, Ottawa and the area for a number of shows and are showcase artists at the Blues Summit, and we will be recording the new album LIVE off the floor in Toronto at a previous Bean Sprout Factory near China Town with The Jack Family.

We write our music to be dynamic and relatable. To pull you in and make you feel again. This can be heard on our previously released E.P. 's Always Persevere and Forever Ascending. Both releases are streaming on Spotify and <a href=""http://www.ultrea.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ultrea.bandcamp.com</a> and can also be purchased on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play and many more online retailers.d<br/>Ultrea means, to always persevere.

</div></div>","We are Ultrea It is our goal to make music that MATTERS. We know that music speaks to humans on an emotional level. Music with passion, encouragement, and drive can awaken a fire within us. It is a fire we wish to share with the world.   We are a hard rock 5 piece from southern Wisconsin. We have created this campaign to create our 3rd Studio EP. But more importantly to involve as many people as interested in building it together This will be our biggest and best yet of Ultrea with more music, more perks, and more fun to share.
   The Goal... $5000 In a nutshell? Recording costs. Time is money. Every contribution, pre-order, and perk claimed literally buys us time in the studio. The quicker we reach our goal the sooner the music hits your earholes. We've gone the route of recording ourselves for our 1st EP ""Always Persevere"" but have since found a home away from home in Madison's Megatone Studios.  There we created our 2nd EP ""Forever Ascending"" the result was an incredible step in the forward direction. We will be returning to start work on EP #3 this winter. We know exactly what we have to do to get new music into your hands and are ready to get started, but to do that as quickly as possible WE NEED YOU!
Choose from perks like...
 Being the FIRST to get the new record - Tshirts and merch packs exclusive to this campaign -  Video access during recording sessions  - Be a guest vocalist on one of our tracks - Party with the band - Free access to live performances - even a house show in your honor. 
We tried to come up with fun, interactive, and important perks to choose from.
If we EXCEED our goal, the extra funds will be used to aid in the distribution and reach of the release, for touring, special features, and more.
If we do not meet our goal, we will still soldier on and get the New EP out as soon as humanly possible.    We're in this together As humans we know from history that divided we fall, but united WE RISE. Join us in the victory of completing our 3rd release and the experience of building it together. 
We all feel struggles, loss, courage, hope, and love. This is what you can expect to feel when you listen to the newest Ultrea music.    The reality is...
We are not funded by a label, corporate sponsors, or have endorsement contracts. Everything we do is built by our blood, sweat, tears and love for our fans, and humanity. The same love we have to support our families: spouses, significant others, children (future world changers), friends, bandfam, and fur babies.

</h3>Com molts sabreu Indiegogo és una plataforma de Crowfunding on la gent que confia en un projecte pot fer aportacions i ser mecenes a canvi d'unes recompenses. Encara que el videoclip Canviant la pell ja està rodat, ens falta una petita ajuda per acabar la postproducció, és a dir, el muntatge, color i alguns efectes. Hem pensat fer aquesta campanya per poder finançar la postproducció del vídeoclip i, a més, aprofitar i destinar l'altra part a fer un altre videoclip d'una altra cançó de la cantant Txell Sota. Al no tenir un suport econòmic extern, però si moltes ganes de fer peces audiovisuals amb sensibilitat i que facin pensar, creiem necessari l'ajuda de tots vosaltres per treure endavant un segon videoclip amb la mateixa filosofia i el mateix equip.

<h3>Memòria de la cantant</h3>
</div>
<div>Ja feia temps que escrivia lletres que buscaven ser cançons.

<p>Guiada per un seguit de ‘casualitats necessàries’ van
aparèixer els compositors <span>Pepo Domènech i Miquel Roldán,
teixint melodies amb sentiments, filant cançons.</span></p>
<p>He tingut la sort de comptar, també, amb uns grans músics que
es van posar al servei de paraules, sons i melodies noves. Cadascú d’ells va
aportar la seva sensibilitat. </p>
<p>Necessitava, però, que algú li donés coherència, que
entengués quin so havia de protagonitzar el disc. I aquí és on vaig buscar al
productor Èric Vinaixa. Va cuidar cada vibració, trobant un estil final molt
proper al so que jo tenia dins del cor.<br/>
A <span>tooots, moltes gràcies pel viatge!!!!</span></p>
<p>I llavors va arribar el director de Canviant la Pell, <span>Txetxu García,
amb tota la seva empenta, gosadia, il·lusió, temeritat... i va fer fàcil el difícil.
Vam sumar pors i inseguretats i va sorgir la força i la inspiració.<br/>
Ha estat un rodatge de tres dies màgic!!!! Aquells regals per l’esperit que et fan
sentir molt viva! Hi ha vivències que les paraules no són suficients per
explicar. </span></p>
<p>Gràcies a tots per perdre’ns en el món de la fantasia i la
imaginació!!!!! </p>
<p></p>

<h3>Memòria del director</h3>
<div>
<p>Quan la Txell es va reunir amb mi i em va dir que volia que jo
fos el director del videoclip de la seva cançó, vaig pensar: Està igual de boja
que jo. Em vaig posar a escoltar les cançons i va haver una en concret que em
va cridar molt l'atenció: “Canviant la pell”. Aquesta cançó em va transportar a
un altre món, un món de somnis on has de deixar enrere el passat i centrar-te
en el present per canviar el futur. La sensibilitat que tenia aquesta cançó
parlava de canvis, de lluitar, de no tenir por i de buscar-se a un mateix. Ho
veia tot molt clar en el meu cap, però necessitava ser transmesa a un
llenguatge universal perquè arribés el missatge a tothom. Així doncs, em vaig
posar a treballar en una idea molt visual i metafòrica que pogués entendre
tothom. Volia que les persones de qualsevol país i de qualsevol nacionalitat,
en veure aquest videoclip, es poguessin sentir identificats i els fes
reflexionar sobre el seu JO interior. Que es preguntessin si estan a gust amb
la vida que porten o s’han de replantejar coses per fer un canvi. </p>
<p>El videoclip – igual que la cançó- parla de
l'aclaparament quotidià en una societat d'estrés. Parla del caos i de l'ordre,
del passat, del present i del futur. Parla del nen que tots tenim dins, de les
metes a complir, dels somnis i de l'amor. I ,en definitiva, parla de la vida.
D'una vida perduda o d'una vida per trobar. De perdre's i de trobar-se.</p>

<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Per a què és el finançament?</span><br/>
<b>Meta 1:</b> 915$ (800 €) <br/>
Si arribem al primer objectiu, els diners s’utilitzaran
per acabar el videoclip de Canviant La Pell. Els 800 euros cobreixen les
despeses de muntatge, laboratori de color, mescles finals i les despeses de la
campanya de crowfunding. <br/><b>
Meta 2: </b>4003$ (3500 €)<br/>
Si aconseguim el 100% del primer objectiu,
destinarem el que aconseguim del segon objectiu a la realització d'un altre
videoclip amb una altra cançó del mateix disc. Si aconseguim part o la
totalitat del segon objectiu, aconseguiríem cobrir part de les següents
despeses:<br/>
- Càmera, il·luminació i maquinària de
rodatge.<br/>
- Segur de rodatge.<br/>
- Catering i despeses de transports. <br/>
- Localitzacions.<br/>
- Material d'art ( atretzzo i vestuari)<br/><b>
Meta 3:</b> 6289$ (5500€)<br/>
Amb aquest últim objectiu, a part de poder
realitzar un videoclip amb una excel·lent qualitat, podríem destinar una part
dels diners a pagar simbòlicament a tot l'equip que ens va acompanyar en el
primer videoclip i que volem que ens acompanyi en el segon. Va ser un
equip meravellós i sensible, i es mereix les millors condicions per part nostre.
<p></p>
<p>Sabem que és una quantitat alta de
diners, però si entre tots vosaltres doneu un cop de mà, podrem treure endavant
dos videoclips genials que ens traslladaran a altres dimensions i podrem sentir
dins nostre les cançons d'una cantant amb una sensibilitat especial. No és gens
fàcil per a una cantant que treu el seu primer disc poder finançar un videoclip;
Per això us necessitem!</p>

Ja feia temps que escrivia lletres que buscaven ser cançons.

Guiada per un seguit de ‘casualitats necessàries’ van
aparèixer els compositors Pepo Domènech i Miquel Roldán,
teixint melodies amb sentiments, filant cançons.
He tingut la sort de comptar, també, amb uns grans músics que
es van posar al servei de paraules, sons i melodies noves. Cadascú d’ells va
aportar la seva sensibilitat. 
Necessitava, però, que algú li donés coherència, que
entengués quin so havia de protagonitzar el disc. I aquí és on vaig buscar al
productor Èric Vinaixa. Va cuidar cada vibració, trobant un estil final molt
proper al so que jo tenia dins del cor.
A tooots, moltes gràcies pel viatge!!!!
I llavors va arribar el director de Canviant la Pell, Txetxu García,
amb tota la seva empenta, gosadia, il·lusió, temeritat... i va fer fàcil el difícil.
Vam sumar pors i inseguretats i va sorgir la força i la inspiració.
Ha estat un rodatge de tres dies màgic!!!! Aquells regals per l’esperit que et fan
sentir molt viva! Hi ha vivències que les paraules no són suficients per
explicar. 
Gràcies a tots per perdre’ns en el món de la fantasia i la
imaginació!!!!! 




Memòria del director

Quan la Txell es va reunir amb mi i em va dir que volia que jo
fos el director del videoclip de la seva cançó, vaig pensar: Està igual de boja
que jo. Em vaig posar a escoltar les cançons i va haver una en concret que em
va cridar molt l'atenció: “Canviant la pell”. Aquesta cançó em va transportar a
un altre món, un món de somnis on has de deixar enrere el passat i centrar-te
en el present per canviar el futur. La sensibilitat que tenia aquesta cançó
parlava de canvis, de lluitar, de no tenir por i de buscar-se a un mateix. Ho
veia tot molt clar en el meu cap, però necessitava ser transmesa a un
llenguatge universal perquè arribés el missatge a tothom. Així doncs, em vaig
posar a treballar en una idea molt visual i metafòrica que pogués entendre
tothom. Volia que les persones de qualsevol país i de qualsevol nacionalitat,
en veure aquest videoclip, es poguessin sentir identificats i els fes
reflexionar sobre el seu JO interior. Que es preguntessin si estan a gust amb
la vida que porten o s’han de replantejar coses per fer un canvi. 
El videoclip – igual que la cançó- parla de
l'aclaparament quotidià en una societat d'estrés. Parla del caos i de l'ordre,
del passat, del present i del futur. Parla del nen que tots tenim dins, de les
metes a complir, dels somnis i de l'amor. I ,en definitiva, parla de la vida.
D'una vida perduda o d'una vida per trobar. De perdre's i de trobar-se.

Per a què és el finançament?
Meta 1: 915$ (800 €) 
Si arribem al primer objectiu, els diners s’utilitzaran
per acabar el videoclip de Canviant La Pell. Els 800 euros cobreixen les
despeses de muntatge, laboratori de color, mescles finals i les despeses de la
campanya de crowfunding. 
Meta 2: 4003$ (3500 €)
Si aconseguim el 100% del primer objectiu,
destinarem el que aconseguim del segon objectiu a la realització d'un altre
videoclip amb una altra cançó del mateix disc. Si aconseguim part o la
totalitat del segon objectiu, aconseguiríem cobrir part de les següents
despeses:
- Càmera, il·luminació i maquinària de
rodatge.
- Segur de rodatge.
- Catering i despeses de transports. 
- Localitzacions.
- Material d'art ( atretzzo i vestuari)
Meta 3: 6289$ (5500€)
Amb aquest últim objectiu, a part de poder
realitzar un videoclip amb una excel·lent qualitat, podríem destinar una part
dels diners a pagar simbòlicament a tot l'equip que ens va acompanyar en el
primer videoclip i que volem que ens acompanyi en el segon. Va ser un
equip meravellós i sensible, i es mereix les millors condicions per part nostre.

Sabem que és una quantitat alta de
diners, però si entre tots vosaltres doneu un cop de mà, podrem treure endavant
dos videoclips genials que ens traslladaran a altres dimensions i podrem sentir
dins nostre les cançons d'una cantant amb una sensibilitat especial. No és gens
fàcil per a una cantant que treu el seu primer disc poder finançar un videoclip;
Per això us necessitem!

Thanks to a few wonderful people, we now have a great space to record our album and the time to do it. We just need your help to get it out into the open. Like everything else we have done, Screen printing t-shirts, making our album packaging, stickers, etc. We have always found a way to create our products with our own hands. We want to do the same with this new album. We want a chance to show you guys what we have learned over the last few years! We want to record, produce, mix, and design our new album all on our own. This is where our Indie Go Go Campaign comes in...Like many recording endeavors, this can be expensive. It is going to require recording equipment such as mics, cables, stands, software, etc., as well as getting the album mastered, and manufactured. After hours of research and years of experience, we have totaled the cost of the album to be $7,000.  Our vision as artists is to create a quality album that you all will love. We want our new music to excite, inspire, move, as well as resonate with each and every one of you. Both of us hope that this new album will show the world just how passionate we are about our music and will maybe even provide an escape for those who need it. Each person who gives to our Indie Go Go Campaign will receive a certain perk depending on the donation amount. We know that we wouldn't be where we are as artists right now if it weren't for each and every one of you. That is why we know we couldn't create this new album without you, and it wouldn't be the same without you all being involved in this process.  Thank you all for supporting our music and taking the time to look at our campaign! You all are what keeps us going!Cheers,Nika and Carly",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>L’Autre Dame is a dark alternative band from Toronto, Canada. Borne from the ashes of it’s predecessor – Alectrona - L’Autre Dame has been playing shows in and around Toronto in various forms since 2013. Every band has its ups and downs, and we have seen many former members come and go. It has been a long and sometimes exhausting process to find the right combination of personalities and creative sensibilities, as well as dedication to advance our music to the next level. It was difficult at times to believe that we would ever find the magic combination needed, however, we have finally attained it,  and have evolved from a bare bones project, into the dynamic assemblance of creative minds we see here today.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our influences range from new wave, to post punk, to synth rock, to gothic rock, and even folk, which has resulted in our own uniquely dark sound. With pounding drums, crunchy guitars, playful bass lines, heavy synths, and hauntingly beautiful harmonies, L'Autre Dame stands apart from the crowd. </p>

<p>We can't count the many times we've been asked at our shows whether we have music to sell, and up until now, we have sadly been unable to fulfill this request. We're at the point now, where we have honed our sound, and are ready to unleash some of our music to the world, so we began recording earlier this summer. With your help, we will be able to complete the rest of the recording process, as well as mixing and mastering of the album, CD manufacturing, and distribution on various platforms.</p>

<p>Our goal is to raise $3000, which will roughly cover the following expenses :</p>
<p>$1000 to cover the costs of studio time</p>
<p>$1000 for mixing and mastering of the tracks</p>
<p>$500 for the first run of 100 CD's</p>
<p>$500 for the distribution of the album</p>

<p>Once we have acquired professional recordings, we will be able to present our material to a wider audience. This will bring a whole new set of opportunities for the band that we have never had before, like booking shows out of town, the possibility of opening for larger bands in our home town, and the ability to send our music to various media outlets, both nationally and internationally.</p>
