We’ve been working at the intersection of art and digital technology for nearly two decades. Founded in 1997, AMODA’s mission is to chronicle and promote this still emerging medium through dynamic showcases, performances, screenings and exhibits. We are a part of a vibrant Central Texas art community, often partnering with other organizations in Austin such as the Thinkery, the Contemporary (formerly the Austin Museum of Art), the Church of the Friendly Ghost, Emergency Response Cinema, Nerd Nite, and SXSW Interactive.</p>
<p><b>IT’S TIME</b>
</p><p>This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we believe that it’s necessary because we’re attempting a new and ambitious offering: a month-long gallery exhibition in the Canopy art space in East Austin along with related talks, performances and screenings. This exhibit will include work from some of the most exciting new media, Net Art, digital animation, and interactive artists in Texas and beyond.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438262336/wpbdld0xodvfjlfudvsp.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/><br/>
<p><b>THE WIDE INTER-CONSCIOUSNESS</b></p>
<p>We will be highlighting artists whose work transcends technology, opting for a more pure expression. Instead of merely commenting on the medium, the artists in this exhibit use digital tools to speak to the human condition.  Their work explores a wide range of themes: dreams, parallel universes, belief systems, imagined histories, altered states of consciousness, intense nostalgia, and the disorganized and surreal nature of our everyday lives.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438262124/pujolgndpdp2gefacer7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>WHY WE NEED YOU</b></p>
<p>This show requires a long list of expenses including: venue rental, equipment rental, installation materials, gear purchases, travel costs, artist honorariums, fabrication, printing, and much more. These expenses far exceed the scope of our annual budget and this show simply won’t be possible without your support. This exhibit has been in the planning stages for awhile and we need your support to make it a reality. In order to make this show what we envision, we’ll need to raise at least $7000 from this crowdfunding campaign. This will be combined with all of our remaining grant money for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Our goal is to make this event free and open to the public. We are planning to maintain regular, daily gallery hours so that everybody can visit at their convenience. <br/></p>

<p><b>WHY AUSTIN NEEDS AMODA</b></p>
<p>Now is the time for an exhibit of digital art such as this. Austin is at a critical point in the maturity of its digital art scene. In larger cities, there are organizations such as Eyebeam, Harvestworks, and Ars Electronica that drive the dialogue about this medium in those regions and internationally. We believe this show positions AMODA to play a similar role in the Central Texas region, especially given our long history as a committed part of this scene with an unwavering focus on digital art.</p><p>This exhibit is a re-awakening, an opening salvo, a jumping off point, and an opportunity to push past the commonly held notions about digital art, film and music so that it can take its proper place in the larger Texas art community. We are an all volunteer arts organization. This means that the handful of devoted people working within our organization somehow find the time and energy to produce this programming in addition to working our full-time jobs. It’s not easy, but we strongly believe in AMODA’s mission, which seems more relevant than ever!</p>

<p>As we approach the tenth anniversary of the flood, the New
Orleans Marketing Corporation will continue spending millions of dollars advertising
and promoting the city’s re-birth.  A
new New Orleans has arisen from the ashes bearing almost no  semblance to the old but rather, more to an adult Disney Land.  The
buzz words and phrases are putting all emphasis on the new and closing the
book on what was before.  New
Orleans is now a city of festivals, not unlike miniature Mardi Gras.  Every day there is a festival or two running
simultaneously, contributing to an aura of frivolity, mirth and merry-making. </p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the August 29th anniversary of the flood, don't expect to hear much about the tens of thousands of former inhabitants who are strewn throughout these United States.  The post Katrina architects
were neither interested nor intended to
include the former citizens in  the making of the new
 New Orleans.   During the planning stage, one of city's most celebrated visionaries even stated, ""we must import a new middle class"".  And so they did, giving no thought to the missing citizens who are still unaccounted 
for. <br/></p>New Orleans was once said to be “the city that care forgot”.   Conversely, the post Katrina New Orleans has proved to be “the city that forgot to care”.   <br/><br/>
<p><b>Art for Truth &amp; Remembrance,
Art as Social Commentary </b></p>
<p>Since the waters were pumped from the city, there has been
virtually nothing done to account for the missing who number in the thousands.  Should not there be a
reckoning of those who are absent?  Do they not
deserve to be accounted for? Who will speak
for the voiceless, those still missing, and the unknown thousands who died, were killed or sacrificed.    </p>

 Beverly is speaking out in her desire to ensure that history includes a more accurate documentation of the flood, and the unreported experiences of many citizens.  She seeks to speak for Katrina’s voiceless, her missing
and the dead.  Beverly's desire is to provoke the world to  think about: </p>

</span>The untold stories of what happened to
the citizens during the days, the weeks and months after the flood?</p>

<p>·<span>

<p><b>The Need for Crowd-Funding</b></p>
<p>The money raised through crowd-funding is needed to help underwrite
the research and completion of additional paintings.  The funds will also help finance three exhibits that will be touring at the same time.  The goal

<p><b>Contingency Plan<br/></b></p>
<p>In the unlikely event this campaign is not successful in reaching our goal, we will continue forward with the traveling exhibit but on a reduced scale.  As opposed to three exhibits running simultaneously we might only run two instead.   Whatever the case, we will work diligently to take the stories of what happened after Katrina in New Orleans to the world.  <br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We (Krista Newey and Kirsten Sullivan) are two emerging artists based in Toronto. Together we aspire to create work that engages audiences in community building through immersive, interdisciplinary performance. The inception of MOOD RING comes from a longing for a safe space to share and engage with a vast, vibrant and all-embracing community through self-expression. MOOD RING will bring together a transformative evening of gallery, performance, and interactive art, inviting collaboration and spontaneity from its participants. With MOOD RING we aim to blur the distinction between performer and audience. Through eliminating the idea that the performer is more important than the audience we aim to eliminate the idea that any one person is more important than any other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking support to help us cover the costs of venue and equipment rentals, and most importantly, to support the artists and performers financially for the time and energy they have contributed to this project and will provide throughout the event. This is also a wonderful way to show your support if you are unable to attend our event in person!</p>
<p>By donating to our campaign you are giving support to local artists and performers who care about the strength and viability of the arts within their communities.  This is an amazing opportunity for Toronto communities to engage with and celebrate in the energy of collaboration, spirit of engagement, and intimacy in performance. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting MOOD RING, you are helping to create space that is safe and receptive to all of its participants, as well as becoming a part of a community that is full of engaged, thoughtful and inspiring local artists.</p>
<p>MOOD RING believes strongly in uplifting the voices of various backgrounds, histories and life experiences. By supporting MOOD RING you are supporting inclusive collaboration, and uplifting voices that may otherwise remain unheard. </p>
<p>MOOD RING desires to host artists from a multitude of backgrounds, as well as attract participants from all walks of life. By supporting MOOD RING you are encouraging cross disciplinary creation, collaboration and intimacy.</p>

<p>This past fall our community here in California was hit by the devastating fires that destroyed hundreds of homes and affected so many lives. These events have deeply changed us. </p>

Story
Suki Somersall - the project's visionary and lead artist - has been affected by the fires first hand. Here Suki talks about those events and the inspiration behind the sculpture in her own words: 
 On Nov. 11, 2018, my home and art studio in Malibu burned to the ground. I had just moved in a few weeks before and was out of town when the fire blazed through Latigo Canyon. The whole experience felt surreal.""

I went to visit the site of my short-lived home where all of my possessions and paintings had burned. It was just a pile of dust and melted metal.
I was struck by the peculiar beauty I saw in all my work, possessions, journals and paintings transmuted back to the Earth and the air.
I was now free.
These things had been trapping me. I was in a prison of my own design and I had not even realized it. The fire released me on a new, higher path, lighter and stronger.
'The Wing Portal' represents this transformation. With your contribution, you will be helping us to create beauty from chaos, and see that sometime destruction creates the most devastatingly beautiful outcome.
 

Where We Are & What's Next

We have already finalized the structural and electrical engineering for the piece, allocated recycled materials from the ruins, and have begun fabrication.
We need the your support to cover welding costs, LED infrastructure, and transportation to and from the Playa.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>MythoFutuRiddim returns with another self-funded pop-up exhibition featuring a new roster of emerging artists who explore ritual, cultural mythology, Afrofuturism and constructed identity. Our first iteration took place in Brooklyn in 2018 and the next version, MythoFutuRiddim 2, will launch in Houston this fall.</p>
<p>As in our tradition, we don't have corporate sponsors and we rely on public support. Therefore, Crowdfunding will be the primary financial support model of this project. Our goal is to raise $4,400 via IndieGoGo to cover the expenses of the exhibition.<br/><br/>As a way to show our gratitude for your patronage, we are offering some amazing patron perks, including vintage records, rare books, as well as original artwork and prints.</p>

<p>We've committed our financial, intellectual and physical resources to our careers. This project represents action,  a direct confrontation to fear, and a more direct affirmation of power of the collaborative spirit.</p>
<h2>Money ain't everything</h2>

</div><p> </p></div>","Overview
MythoFutuRiddim returns with another self-funded pop-up exhibition featuring a new roster of emerging artists who explore ritual, cultural mythology, Afrofuturism and constructed identity. Our first iteration took place in Brooklyn in 2018 and the next version, MythoFutuRiddim 2, will launch in Houston this fall.
As in our tradition, we don't have corporate sponsors and we rely on public support. Therefore, Crowdfunding will be the primary financial support model of this project. Our goal is to raise $4,400 via IndieGoGo to cover the expenses of the exhibition.As a way to show our gratitude for your patronage, we are offering some amazing patron perks, including vintage records, rare books, as well as original artwork and prints.
Our goal is to develop direct connections between emerging artists and emerging collectors. Your patronage will help build a sustainable career model for the participating artists.
Action brings Clarity
My name is A.C. Evans aka Catalyss, an artist, designer and curator based in Houston.  Over the years as an artist, I've found it difficult to develop a sustainable career using the traditional artist model of production, submission, anticipation and rejection.  The standard artist gallery relationship is exceeding unhealthy and unbalanced.  Most agreements leave artists with little to no leverage. Admittedly, there are organizations that can provide support, but they are often budget strapped and therefore relegate artists to desperately compete for an ever diminishing pool of grants, fellowships and residencies. Instead of complaining about circumstances, we believe its time for artists to actively create the change they want to see.

<h3>Spiritual Soldiers Represent Goodness</h3>
<p>People are profoundly touched when standing in front of a towering Soldier built entirely of chairs and borne of a vision to help people heal. When they see the random chair pieces that created the Soldier they realize that they too are made of pieces and that it’s possible to heal their brokenness and become whole. When you stand in the light of this army and raise your hands to the Creator or Soul Soldier, you feel wonder, hopefulness, and peace.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582828275/fm6kmm0fwamgjqsqfnwf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It was 1991, I visited a warehouse full of broken chairs piled 40 feet high and for some reason, I saw giant soldiers looking back at me. It was then that I had a vision of creating a spiritual army for those who could not stand up or fight for themselves. It was a holy moment; I knew then that one day I would build a spiritual army to <strong>create peace from pieces</strong> and make these healing Soldiers. Twenty-five years later, Mary Stover, a WWII US Army Nurse and my mother-in-law,  faced elder abuse and in a moment of exhaustion I cried out, ""God, you need an army to fight for her"", and that's when I received the message to <strong>""build it now""</strong>. So I began at once to bring the broken pieces to life as a symbolic army to fight for her and for those who could not fight for themselves. <strong>These Soldiers are your army. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582828325/h4kr3qbyok8djtgxrqzu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These spiritual Soldiers stand victorious in the face of adversity. Join this voyage with me; with your help, we can build more Soldiers and share this army with others. The Soldiers are 16' 10"" to 24' 9"" tall and named the Sentinel, the Guardian, Brotherly Love, Soul Man, Creator &amp; Humanity and Victory. <strong>Each sculpture has a deeper meaning and represents a form of strength and guidance: peace, love, protection, victory, silence, touch, ancient wisdom.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584129380/moppfjvebjaplhu1yxha.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Why Are We Raising Funds? </h3>
<p><strong>We want to build more Soldiers and take them on tour to share with those who want to find peace through these broken pieces.</strong></p>
<p>I’m Visionary Steve Farland and together with Builder/Sculptor Brian Sartor we created these SEVEN <strong>Spiritual Soldiers. </strong>With your help, we can share this message of <strong>peace through pieces</strong> with the world. These broken pieces create wholeness and from this brokenness, I see a vision of healing, of <strong>Victory through broken pieces</strong>. Like these Soldiers, if we embrace our broken pieces, we will find where we fit together and where we are whole.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582828402/qww9xuoechc1rcxno5uv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""Calm seas never made a good sailor. The hard things in life, the reasons that we need to embrace the things that break us is because if you shed them and give them away, you’ll have no ballast, you’ll never be able to weather bigger storms. If you never acknowledge the meaning, then the lesson is never learned. It’s painful; you shed the very lesson you were supposed to learn."" (Steve Farland)</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>We’d like your help to share Victory Art with the world!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our first goal is to raise funds to <strong>create a 501(c)3</strong> for the Soldiers; we estimate this cost at $4K.</li>
<li>Next, we need to find volunteer <strong>Artists and Sculptors</strong> who will collaborate with us to create additional Soldiers to complete our Spiritual Army! </li>
<li>$12K will be used for custom-built <strong>Shipping Crates</strong> to safely travel on tour. They have been carefully blanketed and wrapped and are awaiting their future homes.</li>
<li>$6K will go to purchasing a good, clean, used <strong>road-worthy trailer</strong> to be used to transport the Soldiers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Corner blocks</strong> will be mailed to anyone donating over $50. Your message to humanity will be part of our next Soldier!</li>
<li>Any remaining funds will be used to <strong>seek grants and foundations</strong>—as well as to contact museums and other venues that would be interested in displaying the Victory Art Soldiers.</li>

<h3>What's a Corner Block? It's your Perk!</h3>
<p>This is <strong>The Guardian. </strong>As big as he is (16 ft., 10 in) he can’t stand without <strong>corner blocks</strong> holding him together. He needs them. So, when people get divided and try to break people away from people, it really is pointless because they’re breaking away from themselves. <strong>Their corners are needed.

</div><p>That's our story and we are so thankful that you're interested in helping to build a Spiritual Army! </p><p><strong>Thanks, EVERYONE!</strong></p></div>","Spiritual Soldiers Represent Goodness
People are profoundly touched when standing in front of a towering Soldier built entirely of chairs and borne of a vision to help people heal. When they see the random chair pieces that created the Soldier they realize that they too are made of pieces and that it’s possible to heal their brokenness and become whole. When you stand in the light of this army and raise your hands to the Creator or Soul Soldier, you feel wonder, hopefulness, and peace.

It was 1991, I visited a warehouse full of broken chairs piled 40 feet high and for some reason, I saw giant soldiers looking back at me. It was then that I had a vision of creating a spiritual army for those who could not stand up or fight for themselves. It was a holy moment; I knew then that one day I would build a spiritual army to create peace from pieces and make these healing Soldiers. Twenty-five years later, Mary Stover, a WWII US Army Nurse and my mother-in-law,  faced elder abuse and in a moment of exhaustion I cried out, ""God, you need an army to fight for her"", and that's when I received the message to ""build it now"". So I began at once to bring the broken pieces to life as a symbolic army to fight for her and for those who could not fight for themselves. These Soldiers are your army. 

These spiritual Soldiers stand victorious in the face of adversity. Join this voyage with me; with your help, we can build more Soldiers and share this army with others. The Soldiers are 16' 10"" to 24' 9"" tall and named the Sentinel, the Guardian, Brotherly Love, Soul Man, Creator & Humanity and Victory. Each sculpture has a deeper meaning and represents a form of strength and guidance: peace, love, protection, victory, silence, touch, ancient wisdom.

 

Why Are We Raising Funds? 
We want to build more Soldiers and take them on tour to share with those who want to find peace through these broken pieces.
I’m Visionary Steve Farland and together with Builder/Sculptor Brian Sartor we created these SEVEN Spiritual Soldiers. With your help, we can share this message of peace through pieces with the world. These broken pieces create wholeness and from this brokenness, I see a vision of healing, of Victory through broken pieces. Like these Soldiers, if we embrace our broken pieces, we will find where we fit together and where we are whole.

""Calm seas never made a good sailor. The hard things in life, the reasons that we need to embrace the things that break us is because if you shed them and give them away, you’ll have no ballast, you’ll never be able to weather bigger storms. If you never acknowledge the meaning, then the lesson is never learned. It’s painful; you shed the very lesson you were supposed to learn."" (Steve Farland)
We’d like your help to share Victory Art with the world!

Our first goal is to raise funds to create a 501(c)3 for the Soldiers; we estimate this cost at $4K.
Next, we need to find volunteer Artists and Sculptors who will collaborate with us to create additional Soldiers to complete our Spiritual Army! 
$12K will be used for custom-built Shipping Crates to safely travel on tour. They have been carefully blanketed and wrapped and are awaiting their future homes.
$6K will go to purchasing a good, clean, used road-worthy trailer to be used to transport the Soldiers.

Corner blocks will be mailed to anyone donating over $50. Your message to humanity will be part of our next Soldier!
Any remaining funds will be used to seek grants and foundations—as well as to contact museums and other venues that would be interested in displaying the Victory Art Soldiers.



 
What's a Corner Block? It's your Perk!
This is The Guardian. As big as he is (16 ft., 10 in) he can’t stand without corner blocks holding him together. He needs them. So, when people get divided and try to break people away from people, it really is pointless because they’re breaking away from themselves. Their corners are needed. Your corners are needed. When we toured in NYC, I took 1000 of these corner blocks and put them on a table and asked people to write a message to humanity and these are some of the messages that were written. Your message will be included in our next soldier.

We’ll send a corner block to everyone who donates over $50. Please write a message to humanity and send it back to us. We’ll include your message in the next Soldier we build and your words will go forward in that sculpture as it travels. We learn that if you take the smallest and the biggest, they fit together perfectly and uniquely and together, they rise to victory.

<p>Creating chaotic balance is an art form according to multimedia artist Eddy Bogaert. In

fundraising movement.
</p>
<p>Eddy has dedicated his life to his craft and to the art community, and now we are asking for your help. In order to
continue to create, curate exhibitions and build his brand, funding is desperately needed. Your help will go towards
buying paint, canvases, 3D glasses, black lights, resin, and respirators. We are asking for donations (big or small) to help
the cause. For donations of certain value, Eddy will create you a personal thank you, ranging from a t-shirt, through to
personalizing a painting, or jazz up your favorite pair of sneakers with his signature touch.
</p>
<p>Ten percent of all proceeds raised will go towards WhiteBox Charity foundation, which aims to support local artists
and gives them a platform to showcase their work. The charity offers diverse programs to nurture community growth
for individuals who would otherwise not have the means to support their passion.
</p>
<p>Eddy has exhibited his work nationally including the Hampton's, Manhattan and Brooklyn, and been featured in the
wall street journal, Nakid magazine, and Culture Mag. He draws inspiration from nightlife, lust, desire, and pop- cul-
ture. His paintings are interactive and have discreet subliminal messages, which can only be seen under certain
lighting conditions. Eddy has brought the concept of 3D into his paintings adding dimensions and layers, making
his pieces dynamic and alluring.

Food Love / Alimento Y Amor, a nourishing bi-lingual book, is about to become a vibrant mural in the heart of downtown Santa Cruz. 

Three elegant images, with compelling text in French, English, and Spanish, will enrich and beautify our canvas - the currently blank wall facing the lively Downtown Santa Cruz Farmer's Market.


Led by the author and creator of Food Love/Alimento Y Amor, M.Sophia Santiago, the mural project is brought to you buy a team of passionate, skilled art professionals, painters, students, community art-lovers and supporters! 

Know who else we need on the team?  YOU.



Art Matters!

Another mural downtown? YES! One that includes the community in the making,  illustrating the viability of a creative economy of, and by, the community.

During the production of the mural, Food Love/Alimento Y Amor supports artists and shows one pathway to young people considering a career as an artist. Led by muralist and Santa Cruz native Elijah Pfotenhauer, five students from his high school mural program and a Cabrillo College art student will be hired and paid to paint the 60-foot-long mural along with him, a prime example of the Santa Cruz's creative economy in action!


Once it's up on the wall, Food Love/Alimento Y Amor reminds those who come in contact with the message, of the farm-to-table journey their food takes, and encourages healthy choices for our community. The multi-lingual content is inclusive and welcoming to all ages, so the message and beauty will not be lost on even the little ones!

While we are thrilled to have received the blessing on the City of Santa Cruz City Council and Arts Commission, funding for Food Love/Alimento Y Amor funding will come from individuals and businesses like yours, giving the community ""Ownership"" of the project, and the pride of being a tangible part of the team.

What perks, you ask?


Snack and Appetizer supporters will get Food Love Buttons and copies of the books in English and Spanish, respectively.

<p>We're a multifarious crew of friends from Los Angeles, Reno, Chicago and New York who share a passion for soup and service. The SFB story stems from a brief moment many, many years ago, far beyond Black Rock City's Esplanade, on a frigid deep playa evening. There, gazing at the brothtaking sky and discussing the soupernatural, sat our founder, Noodles and his brother, Max. Although initially vibrant and jovial, their topic of discussion soon shifted to the bitter cold air and a desire for simple pleasures.</p>
<p>""I could sure go for a blanket right now. You know, warm me up from the outside in."" Max remarked as he shivered in the deepest of deep playa.</p>
<p>""I could go for a bowl of soup to warm me up from the inside out!"" Noodles replied.</p>
<p>Now what followed may be the worst idea ever uttered as Max suggested: ""How about a bowl of blanket flavored soup?""</p>
<p>In a harsh tone, Noodles replied: ""That's sounds disgusting! Who want's to eat soup that tastes like blankets!?""</p>
<p>Hours passed and their situation worsened. But suddenly, a dusty thought shot out of the Man's neon head, blew across the playa, swirled around the temple walls and shot directly into Noodles's noggin as an idea of spectacular brilliance.</p>
<p>""Some Soup Flavored Blankets, now that would be warmly delicious!"" He proclaimed.</p>
<p>Max agreed! And the two brothers jumped to their feet, crossed the cold desert floor and returned to camp to procrastinate for seven years.</p>
<p>As veteran burners we understand the significance of your trash fence quest and the sometimes difficult elements you encounter. Soup Flavored Blankets is a warm soupy refuge and our gift to the many wandering souls of Burning Man.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The jumbo-sized inflatable SFB can emits light and serves as a navigational aid for all the weary travelers. Directly across from the soup can exists an equally huge SFB Premium Cracker box. Inside, participants will find an assortment of delicious ready-made soup and hot beverage mixes as well as access to boiling water.</p>
<p>After treating yourself to the tastiest soup in Black Rock City, choose a blanket and carefully place your mug of soup into the provided pouch. Begin to wrap your shivering body inside the insulating blanket. You are now comfortably snuggled inside a Soup Flavored Blanket, slurp on wandering souls!</p>

</div></div>","Your Soup Flavored Blankets Staff

We're a multifarious crew of friends from Los Angeles, Reno, Chicago and New York who share a passion for soup and service. The SFB story stems from a brief moment many, many years ago, far beyond Black Rock City's Esplanade, on a frigid deep playa evening. There, gazing at the brothtaking sky and discussing the soupernatural, sat our founder, Noodles and his brother, Max. Although initially vibrant and jovial, their topic of discussion soon shifted to the bitter cold air and a desire for simple pleasures.
""I could sure go for a blanket right now. You know, warm me up from the outside in."" Max remarked as he shivered in the deepest of deep playa.
""I could go for a bowl of soup to warm me up from the inside out!"" Noodles replied.
Now what followed may be the worst idea ever uttered as Max suggested: ""How about a bowl of blanket flavored soup?""
In a harsh tone, Noodles replied: ""That's sounds disgusting! Who want's to eat soup that tastes like blankets!?""
Hours passed and their situation worsened. But suddenly, a dusty thought shot out of the Man's neon head, blew across the playa, swirled around the temple walls and shot directly into Noodles's noggin as an idea of spectacular brilliance.
""Some Soup Flavored Blankets, now that would be warmly delicious!"" He proclaimed.
Max agreed! And the two brothers jumped to their feet, crossed the cold desert floor and returned to camp to procrastinate for seven years.
As veteran burners we understand the significance of your trash fence quest and the sometimes difficult elements you encounter. Soup Flavored Blankets is a warm soupy refuge and our gift to the many wandering souls of Burning Man.
 
Your Soup Flavored Blankets Experience

The jumbo-sized inflatable SFB can emits light and serves as a navigational aid for all the weary travelers. Directly across from the soup can exists an equally huge SFB Premium Cracker box. Inside, participants will find an assortment of delicious ready-made soup and hot beverage mixes as well as access to boiling water.
After treating yourself to the tastiest soup in Black Rock City, choose a blanket and carefully place your mug of soup into the provided pouch. Begin to wrap your shivering body inside the insulating blanket. You are now comfortably snuggled inside a Soup Flavored Blanket, slurp on wandering souls!


But remember: You eat the soup, you take the moop!

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Short Summary</span></p> <p>Nearly twenty-five years ago, letters, papers, and ephemera from the Estate of Monroe Wheeler, director of exhibitions and publications at the Museum of Modern Art from 1939 through 1967, were stored in carton boxes in an attic and nearly forgotten. One of the boxes contained Christmas cards sent to Monroe Wheeler by some of the most significant American, European and South American artists of his time during his tenure at MoMA. They were unique  handmade or limited edition cards - artworks essentially - sent by artists such as Ben Shahn, Robert Andrew Parker, Jean Cocteau, Roberto Montenegro, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Herbert Bayer, Rufino Tamayo, Bruno Munari and Leonard Baskin. The cards were so astounding when we uncovered them that we wanted to share their unique beauty - and the history of the artists' relationships with Monroe Wheeler - by publishing a book, which would honor his legacy as a lover of typography and publisher of fine books as well as his influence on artists' careers and museum publications design.</p>
<p>With the costs of high-quality book publication, your help is needed to fund the production of this book.  In appreciation we are offering distinctive perks from Monroe Wheeler's archive - as well as the book itself - so that we can share with you some of the history it contains.</p>

</h3></span></h3>
<p>The book will be published by Daylight Books in an edition of 1,000 copies and will be distributed in the United States. Conceived and edited by Vincent Cianni, the 96-page book (including text) will measure 10 x 8"" and contain approximately 50 handmade or limited edition Christmas cards by an array of artists from the United States, Europe, Mexico and South America that will be reproduced as close to the their original size with two facsimile pieces laid in on the inside of the front and back covers. The cover will be based on an image by <strong>Alexander Calder </strong>from a Christmas card that was sent by <strong>Galerie Aimé Maeght</strong> to Monroe Wheeler (see below) and evokes the idea of Christmas. In addition, 'Sandy' Calder and Monroe were close friends and frequent collaborators from their time in Paris and Monroe's publication of <em><strong>THE FABLES OF AESOP</strong>, </em>by <strong>Harrison of Paris</strong><em>, </em>which included fifty drawings by Calder as illustrations.  Their collaboration and friendship continued throughout the decades while Monroe was Director of Publications and Exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">The book project can be seen as a way of reintroducing Monroe Wheeler to a larger audience. Relatively unknown now, his work at the Museum of Modern Art helped shape the way we understand the day-to-day operations of an art museum in terms of fundraising, exhibitions, publications and book design. His position as Director of Publications and Exhibitions laid the groundwork for for the development of museum exhibition catalogs and monographs. His book designs were recognized as the highest quality of their kind at the time. In addition, Monroe Wheeler conceived, developed and expanded MoMA's greeting card sales, now recognized as some of the most unique cards on the market today. This work, along with his association with many recognized artists of his time, will be preserved with the production of this book of Christmas cards that he received from them over the years. </span></h3>

Soon after he and Wescott went to London and traveled with American expatriate and French literati friends through Europe, primarily in Germany and France, including Paris and Villefranche-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. Wheeler eventually settled in Paris with Glenway Wescott and the young photographer <b>George Platt Lynes</b>, who would become Wheeler's lover. It was in Paris that Wheeler began friendships with artistic and literary figures, such as <b>Jean Cocteau</b> and <b>Gertrude Stein</b>.  He established hi imprint Harrison of Paris with close friend <b>Barbara Harrison</b>, who eventually married Wescott's younger brother, Lloyd. Harrison of Paris created beautiful, limited edition books with fine bindings sold at moderate prices and published 13 books in the four years that it was in business, with titles such as <i>A Sketch of My Life</i>, the first English translation of Thomas Mann’s autobiography, <i>Janet Flanner's Songbook, </i> the first edition of Glenway Wescott’s novella <i>The Babe's Bed </i>and <i>A Calendar of Saints for Unbelievers, </i>as well as<i>The Fables of Aesop <i>According To Sir Roger L’Estrange </i></i>with 50 drawings by <b>Alexander Calder. </b>While producing <i>The Fables of Aesop,</i> Wheeler worked closely with Calder and established a close relationship, both professionally and personally, that would last a lifetime. (Calder was also a frequent guest at parties thrown by Wheeler and Wescott.)</p><p>In 1935 Wheeler, Wescott, and Lynes  returned to the United States setting up homes in various New York City apartments and in New Jersey, where they would spend weekends at Stone-Blossom and Hay-Meadows.  That same year Monroe Wheeler became a guest curator and a member of the library committee at the Museum of Modern Art. He was appointed to his permanent position as Director of Publications in 1939 and as its first Director of Exhibitions in 1940. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">During his tenure at MoMA, Wheeler organized the exhibition programs and oversaw the publication of over 300 titles, defining the standards for museum catalogues and monographs that still exist today. Their scholarship, layout, and design won awards as high quality visual art books. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Wheeler also authored many of the essays for artist monographs, including </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Henri Matisse, Chaim </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Soutine </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">and </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Georges Rouault</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">. Under his leadership, MoMA began production of Christmas cards, with early contributors such as <b>Saul </b></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Steinberg, Bruno Munari</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> and </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Ben Shahn.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> (In 1950, Wheeler wrote Nelson A.

One of the boxes contained Christmas cards sent to Monroe Wheeler by some of the most significant American, European and South American artists of his time during his tenure at MoMA. They were unique  handmade or limited edition cards - artworks essentially - sent by artists such as Ben Shahn, Robert Andrew Parker, Jean Cocteau, Roberto Montenegro, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Herbert Bayer, Rufino Tamayo, Bruno Munari and Leonard Baskin. The cards were so astounding when we uncovered them that we wanted to share their unique beauty - and the history of the artists' relationships with Monroe Wheeler - by publishing a book, which would honor his legacy as a lover of typography and publisher of fine books as well as his influence on artists' careers and museum publications design.
With the costs of high-quality book publication, your help is needed to fund the production of this book.  In appreciation we are offering distinctive perks from Monroe Wheeler's archive - as well as the book itself - so that we can share with you some of the history it contains.





About the book

The book will be published by Daylight Books in an edition of 1,000 copies and will be distributed in the United States. Conceived and edited by Vincent Cianni, the 96-page book (including text) will measure 10 x 8"" and contain approximately 50 handmade or limited edition Christmas cards by an array of artists from the United States, Europe, Mexico and South America that will be reproduced as close to the their original size with two facsimile pieces laid in on the inside of the front and back covers. The cover will be based on an image by Alexander Calder from a Christmas card that was sent by Galerie Aimé Maeght to Monroe Wheeler (see below) and evokes the idea of Christmas. In addition, 'Sandy' Calder and Monroe were close friends and frequent collaborators from their time in Paris and Monroe's publication of THE FABLES OF AESOP, by Harrison of Paris, which included fifty drawings by Calder as illustrations.  Their collaboration and friendship continued throughout the decades while Monroe was Director of Publications and Exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art.

The second facsimile is Bruno Munari's playful 1957 'violin' Christmas greeting to Mr. Wheeler. 

                               If enough funds are raised in the campaign, we will also be able to reproduce some of the cards as gatefolds or French folds of some of the most unique and masterful Christmas cards in the archive. This is a flexible funding campaign meaning if we don't reach our intended goal, we still receive the contributions made, however with more contributions, we can do more with the design.)

The Impact
The book project can be seen as a way of reintroducing Monroe Wheeler to a larger audience. Relatively unknown now, his work at the Museum of Modern Art helped shape the way we understand the day-to-day operations of an art museum in terms of fundraising, exhibitions, publications and book design. His position as Director of Publications and Exhibitions laid the groundwork for for the development of museum exhibition catalogs and monographs. His book designs were recognized as the highest quality of their kind at the time. In addition, Monroe Wheeler conceived, developed and expanded MoMA's greeting card sales, now recognized as some of the most unique cards on the market today. This work, along with his association with many recognized artists of his time, will be preserved with the production of this book of Christmas cards that he received from them over the years.

Soon after he and Wescott went to London and traveled with American expatriate and French literati friends through Europe, primarily in Germany and France, including Paris and Villefranche-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. Wheeler eventually settled in Paris with Glenway Wescott and the young photographer George Platt Lynes, who would become Wheeler's lover. It was in Paris that Wheeler began friendships with artistic and literary figures, such as Jean Cocteau and Gertrude Stein.  He established hi imprint Harrison of Paris with close friend Barbara Harrison, who eventually married Wescott's younger brother, Lloyd. Harrison of Paris created beautiful, limited edition books with fine bindings sold at moderate prices and published 13 books in the four years that it was in business, with titles such as A Sketch of My Life, the first English translation of Thomas Mann’s autobiography, Janet Flanner's Songbook,  the first edition of Glenway Wescott’s novella The Babe's Bed and A Calendar of Saints for Unbelievers, as well asThe Fables of Aesop According To Sir Roger L’Estrange with 50 drawings by Alexander Calder. While producing The Fables of Aesop, Wheeler worked closely with Calder and established a close relationship, both professionally and personally, that would last a lifetime. (Calder was also a frequent guest at parties thrown by Wheeler and Wescott.)In 1935 Wheeler, Wescott, and Lynes  returned to the United States setting up homes in various New York City apartments and in New Jersey, where they would spend weekends at Stone-Blossom and Hay-Meadows.  That same year Monroe Wheeler became a guest curator and a member of the library committee at the Museum of Modern Art. He was appointed to his permanent position as Director of Publications in 1939 and as its first Director of Exhibitions in 1940. During his tenure at MoMA, Wheeler organized the exhibition programs and oversaw the publication of over 300 titles, defining the standards for museum catalogues and monographs that still exist today. Their scholarship, layout, and design won awards as high quality visual art books. Wheeler also authored many of the essays for artist monographs, including Henri Matisse, Chaim Soutine and Georges Rouault. Under his leadership, MoMA began production of Christmas cards, with early contributors such as Saul Steinberg, Bruno Munari and Ben Shahn. (In 1950, Wheeler wrote Nelson A. Rockefeller that the Christmas cards had been so profitable that MoMA would begin producing blank greeting cards year-round.) During his tenure at MoMA, Monroe Wheeler forged relationships with many popular artists of the time. Herbert Bayer and he created exhibits such as the Road to Victory in 1942 and Airways to Peace in 1943. He also worked with Mexican artists Miguel Covarrubias and Roberto Montenegro on the exhibit Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art. It was the largest comprehensive exhibit on Mexican art to date.During World War II, Wheeler served as Chairman of the Committee on Publications for the Office of Inter-American Affairs under Nelson A. Rockefeller and in 1969 was appointed Cultural Advisor of Latin America. He continued to run the Exhibitions and Publications departments and oversaw all of the Museum's outreach programs, including education, traveling exhibitions, and the library until his retirement in 1967. After his retirement, he served as a member of the International Council and remained actively involved with the Museum of Modern Art. In early 1988, months before his death, the Museum dedicated a reading room in the Prints and Illustrated Books Galleries to honor his dedication and contributions.Along with - and mostly separate from - his professional career, Monroe Wheeler continued to develop close relationship with artist friends in New York City, continuing to be supportive of both Glenway Wescott (they remained together until Wescott's death in 1986) and George Platt Lynes until his death in 1955, even after Lynes dissolved the relationship with the two in 1943.  In addition Wheeler's far-reaching influence was well-documented through his life-long friendships with artists such as Pavel Tchelitchev, Paul Cadmus, Jared French and George Tooker. But it was with his private publications and his work at MoMA that Monroe Wheeler left his greatest legacy as a book designer and publisher, an esteemed typographer and a leadership that guided the Museum through its early years to become the most significant and important museum to champion modern art.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The unique and very talented American singer-songwriter David Hykes will be collaborating on Roescheisen's new piece of videoart <i>The Exit Fairytale of Suicide</i>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I am very thrilled to announce that the famous American singer-songwriter David Hykes will compose the film soundtrack! He made pieces for “Baraka,” and “The Tree of Life,” and for many other films... He is currently composing for the famous American film director Terrence Malick. David Hykes is also a teacher of contemplative music and meditation, and media artist. He directs the Harmonic Presence Foundation which since 1981 has explored resonant relationships between mind, music, and the medicine of healing harmonization. His work has been honored by UNESCO, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Edwards Art Fund, the Threshold Foundation and the Flying Elephants Foundation.

A sunray brings light, enchantment:<br/>it transforms and transfigures.” These words by Hermann Hesse convey the idea of what I feel when I am behind a lens.<br/>I was probably predestined to be a photographer.<br/><br/>Born in Rome as “the actor son of an actor father” of Tuscan origins. My great grandfather left Arezzo for the Eternal City in 1865.

The fundamental moments, which have marked the transformation of the urban landscape of Rome , can be reviewed through the work of five generations of photographers.

capturing the amazing beauty of the Ganga's Idols in Kolkata.</p><p>Exhibition of n.20 photographies on color prints 70x100 cm. .</p><p>This encompasses 
shooting in Kolkata capturing the beauty of the Idols of this 
wonderful part of our earth. </p><p>Take a look at those proud, impenetrable eyes towering over you from the pandals. Those eyes will bring the goddess Durga to earth on the day of Chokkhu Daan – when the same eyes are painted on the idol one week before the beginning of Durga Puja annual festival in Kolkata. Goddess Durga, as narrated in the Hindu Mithology, embodies Shatki or divine feminine power. All Gods empowered her in order to destroy the demon Mahishasura who could not be defeated by any man or god. </p><p>The Sanskrit name, Durga, means 'impenetrable' and is the principal form of mother goddess: the goddess of the victory of good over evil. In honor of Durga, Durga Puja festival is celebrated in Kolkata during the period of Navarati (nine nights in Sanskrit). The celebrations continue for 10 days. On the last day, called Dashami (Sanskrit for 10) the idol is immerse in the Ganga waters during the Visarjan (Sanskrit for immersion) pompous celebrations and processions. </p><p></p><p>The idol of Goddess Durga has ten hands and stands on the back of a huge lion. She fights with a demon with ten different weapons.</p><p>Goddess Lakshmi the goddess of wealth and fortune and Goddess Saraswati the goddess of learning and wisdom stand on each side of Durga. And next to them sit, upon a peacock and a mouse, Kartikeya the god of war and Ganesha the god of wisdom, learning, arts and removal of obstacles.</p><p>For 3 days the idols of these gods and goddesses and their mother goddess Durga are worshipped, then  the Puja starts from the seventh day of the moon. On the tenth day of the Hindu calendar the images and idols are immersed in the river waters as the goddess leaves. All idols are luxuriously dressed and decorated in ornaments, some street illuminated with animated lights. During the celebrations the poor are fed and receive handouts. Moreover, in many Puja pandals both rich and poor worship together Durga idols. </p><p><span>In Kolkata, Durga Pooja 2016 starts on October 1st and ends on October 11.While other parts of India and Nepal celebrate it for 5 days from October 6 to October 11.</span></p><p>There are over 500 Durga Puja Pandals in Kolkata, it is almost impossible to count them. If you'll ever want to visit Kolkata, you should plan your trip during the excitement and splendors of Durga Puja. In the meantime, I hope you will enjoy my photographs. Thank you for your interest and also for your contribution to my exhibition of over 20 images, which, if all goes well, will be exposed in Rome, Italy. </p><p>Namaskar.</p><br/></div>","ABOUT MEI am a direct descendant of a family of photographers that have been active in photography since 1870.For some time now he dedicates himself to researching the aesthetics of landscapes and to portraying the abstraction of substance and signs, through personal photographic interpretation and creation.From an article about Alessandro Vasari, published in the magazine “Sguardi on line” – issue n. 4/2002,on the www.nital.it website (Nikon Italia) “When a ray of light falls through a cloudy sky on a dark alley, it can land on any thing: a piece of broken glass on the ground, a torn billboard on a wall or a patch of blond hair. A sunray brings light, enchantment:it transforms and transfigures.” These words by Hermann Hesse convey the idea of what I feel when I am behind a lens.I was probably predestined to be a photographer.Born in Rome as “the actor son of an actor father” of Tuscan origins. My great grandfather left Arezzo for the Eternal City in 1865. In 1870 he opened one of the first studios for the production of art andarchitectural photography in Rome , which had become the capital of the kingdom only in 1867.Since these origins, the Vasari family has always been involved in photography.I am still today produce photography in the fields of art, architecture, industry, advertising and portraits. The Studio Fotografico Vasari works are displayed in several international collections, such as the George Eastman House Museum of Photography in Rochester (USA) in the University of Melbourne and Italian Museums Archives (GNAM, Istituto Nationale per la Grafica, Palazzo Venezia Museum, Palazzo Barberini Museum, Galleria Borghese Museum, Galleria Doria Pamphili).I direct the lenses towards what I feel to be free aesthetic pleasure and I select different subjects, from a landscape to an inanimate detail of an old wall. All of them must have the power of catching my attention and stimulating the click.Photography as an art form is a constant concern to me. I am convinced that many years of experience are necessary before one can appreciate the beauty of one own art. For this reason, I register and archive my work, showing only a small part of my personal “other” face. Exhibitions:2005  “ Memory of the stones” Gallery Arteficinterni - Rome ITALY.2006 “D’ailleurs, c’est toujours les autres qui meurent”, AGAVE  Gallery in Rome Italy. 2007 “Orizzonti” Brancaleone Gallery in Rome Italy.2009 Collettiva a cura di Massagrigia OCCHI ROSSI, Forte Prenestino, Rome ITALY.2010 Collettiva a cura di Massagrigia, OCCHI ROSSI,Forte Prenestino, Rome Italy.2011 Collettiva itinerante, 150 Anni Italia.2012 Collettiva DENTRO DI TE COSA TUA TORRE BRUCIATA, VIA ANTICA CATTEDRALE, Teramo Italy-By Massagrigia.2013 Collettiva;Darkroom Project a Muro Leccese, Puglia, Italy.2014 Collettiva;Darkroom Project, Stutgard, Germany. THE VASARI PHOTOGRAPHERSSince 1870 the activity of the Vasari family represents an important contribution to the documentation of Italy  ART over several generations, representing an iconographic memory of recent Italian history. The fundamental moments, which have marked the transformation of the urban landscape of Rome , can be reviewed through the work of five generations of photographers. The views of Rome Capital, Via Nazionale and Piazza Esedra are famous, as are the photograph of the rebuilding of the city during the reconstruction period post World War II, as well as the new Termini main railway station, the construction works for the1960 Olympic Games, the opera of main artists and architects and the development of churches and museums over the past 100 years of history in Rome. This outstanding documentary patrimony is currently divided between three different funds. Today, a large part of the archive (5,000 21x27 cms glass slides,plus some in 13x18 cms format) is owned by “Calcografia-Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica” (Via della Stamperia 6 – 00187 Roma, tel. + 39 06-699801/69921454, fax:+39 06-69980229). The production from 1910 to the 1950 (350,000 articles, both slides and black and white films) was purchased by “Centro Studi e Archivio della Comunicazione” of the University of Parma (Piazzale Pace 7/a – 43100 Parma , tel. +39 0521-270847/270798, fax +39 0521-207125). The third portion still belongs to the Vasari family private archive, which consists of approximately 40,000 films of various size both b/w and colour. This collection is in continuous development, and includes the Vasari photographic productions from 1950 to the current date.FOR FURTHER INFORMATIONOn line:www.fotovasari.comwww.alessandrovasari.comContacs:info@alessandrovasari.comalessandrovasari@gmail.comphone: 0039 06 3297099fax: 0039 06 3297099mobile: 0039 3932805076ABOUT MY PROJECTI am currently working on an in depth series of  photographs 
capturing the amazing beauty of the Ganga's Idols in Kolkata.Exhibition of n.20 photographies on color prints 70x100 cm. .This encompasses 
shooting in Kolkata capturing the beauty of the Idols of this 
wonderful part of our earth. Take a look at those proud, impenetrable eyes towering over you from the pandals. Those eyes will bring the goddess Durga to earth on the day of Chokkhu Daan – when the same eyes are painted on the idol one week before the beginning of Durga Puja annual festival in Kolkata. Goddess Durga, as narrated in the Hindu Mithology, embodies Shatki or divine feminine power. All Gods empowered her in order to destroy the demon Mahishasura who could not be defeated by any man or god. The Sanskrit name, Durga, means 'impenetrable' and is the principal form of mother goddess: the goddess of the victory of good over evil. In honor of Durga, Durga Puja festival is celebrated in Kolkata during the period of Navarati (nine nights in Sanskrit). The celebrations continue for 10 days. On the last day, called Dashami (Sanskrit for 10) the idol is immerse in the Ganga waters during the Visarjan (Sanskrit for immersion) pompous celebrations and processions. The idol of Goddess Durga has ten hands and stands on the back of a huge lion. She fights with a demon with ten different weapons.Goddess Lakshmi the goddess of wealth and fortune and Goddess Saraswati the goddess of learning and wisdom stand on each side of Durga. And next to them sit, upon a peacock and a mouse, Kartikeya the god of war and Ganesha the god of wisdom, learning, arts and removal of obstacles.For 3 days the idols of these gods and goddesses and their mother goddess Durga are worshipped, then  the Puja starts from the seventh day of the moon. On the tenth day of the Hindu calendar the images and idols are immersed in the river waters as the goddess leaves. All idols are luxuriously dressed and decorated in ornaments, some street illuminated with animated lights. During the celebrations the poor are fed and receive handouts. Moreover, in many Puja pandals both rich and poor worship together Durga idols. In Kolkata, Durga Pooja 2016 starts on October 1st and ends on October 11.While other parts of India and Nepal celebrate it for 5 days from October 6 to October 11.There are over 500 Durga Puja Pandals in Kolkata, it is almost impossible to count them. If you'll ever want to visit Kolkata, you should plan your trip during the excitement and splendors of Durga Puja. In the meantime, I hope you will enjoy my photographs. Thank you for your interest and also for your contribution to my exhibition of over 20 images, which, if all goes well, will be exposed in Rome, Italy. Namaskar.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Having painted murals all over North America, we have yet to paint one in our own home town! So when the Downtown Courtenay Business Improvement Association expressed interest for a mural, we thought it would be a great opportunity for us to add some colour, culture and heritage to our local streets. The mural will focus on the local contributions of the Leung family, who, for over one hundred years, provided the residents of the Comox Valley with the very best in locally grown produce and community and customer support.

Local printing company Done Creative has designed some gorgeous perks for those who contribute; quality limited edition T-shirts, hats and mugs with vintage Leung's grocery and cafe designs. We will also be painting contributor's names into the mural as a lasting thank you and a select number of contributors can have their portraits painted into the mural as customers of the cafe or shopping at the grocery!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Local artist Anna Marcantel was recently invited by GardenWalk of Anaheim to paint a mural for the community... With your help, she plans to seize the opportunity to spread a powerful, positive message to all who view it! </h3>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Artist</h2>
<p>Anna Marcantel is an abstract artist in Anaheim, California, aspiring to spread <strong>joy</strong>, <strong>positivite energy</strong>, and a message of <strong>harmony</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>diversity</strong> through eye-catching, powerful art.</p>
<p>Anna has been an artist at heart since the first time her tiny hand could grasp a paintbrush. Through the years, art took a backseat to more practical pastimes, such as becoming employed (don't grow up; its a trap!). After years of holding a variety of jobs merely to pay the bills, she decided it was time to go on a journey of self-exploration. She discovered her true fulfillment came from unleashing her creative energy on canvas and sharing it with anyone and everyone!</p>
<p>In 2016 Anna quit her job waiting tables and dove head-first into the world of a full-time artist. Since then, Anna has been featured as Artist of the Month at Boulevard 574 in Diamond Bar, sold her paintings in markets and fairs throughout Orange County, instructed for Corks &amp; Canvas in GardenWalk, and started her own paint and sip business Paint &amp; Libate.</p>
<h2>Her Mission</h2>
<p>Anna's paintings often feature bold, bright colors and explore existential motifs. Recently, her creative inspiration has been fueled by the mandala.</p>
<p>In Buddhism the <strong>mandala</strong> is a circular geometric design symbolizing the infinite expansion of our universe. Mandalas are often used in meditation to achieve a deep connection of one's mind and spirit to the universe and all that exists within it.</p>
<p>I created the <strong>Mandala</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Unity</strong> to promote <strong>harmony</strong> and <strong>togetherness</strong> in the most diverse of communities. By painting this mural in GardenWalk of Anaheim, I hope the public will feel a sense of fellowship within their community no matter their gender, orientation, or color. With your help, we can bring this meaningful work of art to life and spread the joy of coming together in peace and comradery!</p>
<p>Anna has been given the opportunity to fill a<strong> 16x13 foot wall space</strong> right in the middle of the <strong>GardenWalk</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Anaheim</strong> to delight visitors and inspire all who pass by! GardenWalk is a wonderful outdoor dining and entertainment center in the heart of Anaheim next door to the <strong>Disneyland</strong> <strong>Resort</strong>. Thousands of tourists pass through every year from all over the world to enjoy the Walk's many shops and restaurants. Locals love it for the Art on The Walk program, where GardenWalk invites local artists to display their work in windows throughout the property and perform live demonstrations at monthly art appreciation events.</p>
<p>The goal is to have the Mandala of Unity completed by January 27th to be debuted at the next big Art on the Walk event!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>About Me: I hold a Masters in Art Education from the Mass College of Art and Design, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the Museum School of Fine Arts. I am the owner and designer for the company B. Felt. I design and manufacture by hand, beautiful felted garments and accessories. My work can be seen in galleries and museum shops around the nation and internationally. My work and show schedule can be viewed on my web site, <a href=""http://www.bfelt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bfelt.com</a>.</li>
<li><p>History: As the National Park boat leaves the Swamp Locks, it enters the lower Pawtucket Canal, heading into the Industrial Canyon. In 1890, if you entered this part of the canal, the crescendos of hundreds of shuttles flying back and forth on the looms would have been deafening. Now, the only sounds are from the outboard motors of the National Park’s Canal boat and the occasional quack of the ducks. Today the mills are filled with artists, entrepreneurs, established businesses, restaurants, condominiums, and apartments. As the canal boat eases through the locks, the building on the right is nothing more than architectural remnants. A ghostly facade of windows belonging to the Dye House was once a two story building and part of the Appleton Mills. It is from these windows that these dyes were unceremoniously dumped into the canals. Some days it would be a red canal, and some days it would be a yellow canal, while other days it would just look like mud.</p></li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3>I Have Just Launched Part 2</h3>
<p>I am more than half way close to my goal. Enterprise Bank has pledged 1000. I am looking to raise $2000 to complete the goal. Please go ro <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/veils-of-color-for-lowell-part-ii/x/3562892#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/veils-of-col...</a> to contribute. Thank you</p>
<ul>
<li>I am planning on raising $4,500 for this campaign. Contributing to this campaign will help me achieve multiple important steps in the re-installing of this piece, including but not limited to: repairing last seasons veils and creating new ones if needed, hiring an engineer to help me with the thermodynamics of the canal and installing the veils without damaging the historic building or the veils and without injury to me or to anyone else involved, </li>
<li>The perks you will obtain if you contribute to this campaign are as followed;</li>
</ul>

<p>$250 a mug tote bag and a t-shirt</p>
<p>$500 a t-shirt and tickets for the canal tour</p>
<p>$1000 Lunch with me in my loft and a personalized tour for 10 people of the canal</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the merchandise given with the perks will be adorned with an abstract graphic of the veils. The postcard will have a photo of the veils from last season's installation.</li>
<li>This installation will be happening whether I meet my goal or not. If I do not reach my goal, I will be forced to pull back on the installation.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>After having done this installation before I am prepared to face the risks I faced last year, and I will be more equipped this time around. I am going to be hiring an engineer to help me with a lot of the challenges I faced, including dealing with the thermodynamics of the canal, figuring out the best solution for installing the veils on the building without damaging it as it is historic, and overcoming the 30 feet high installation on unsteady ground. Having an engineer will make the installation process go much smoother than it had in the past, therefore making me very well prepared.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to contribute to this cause, please help us in another way by sharing this campaign with others through the Indiegogo sharing tools.</li>
<li>If you are willing to help physically, we are also looking for volunteers for the installation of this piece!</li>

About Me: I hold a Masters in Art Education from the Mass College of Art and Design, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the Museum School of Fine Arts. I am the owner and designer for the company B. Felt. I design and manufacture by hand, beautiful felted garments and accessories. My work can be seen in galleries and museum shops around the nation and internationally. My work and show schedule can be viewed on my web site, www.bfelt.com.
History: As the National Park boat leaves the Swamp Locks, it enters the lower Pawtucket Canal, heading into the Industrial Canyon. In 1890, if you entered this part of the canal, the crescendos of hundreds of shuttles flying back and forth on the looms would have been deafening. Now, the only sounds are from the outboard motors of the National Park’s Canal boat and the occasional quack of the ducks. Today the mills are filled with artists, entrepreneurs, established businesses, restaurants, condominiums, and apartments. As the canal boat eases through the locks, the building on the right is nothing more than architectural remnants. A ghostly facade of windows belonging to the Dye House was once a two story building and part of the Appleton Mills. It is from these windows that these dyes were unceremoniously dumped into the canals. Some days it would be a red canal, and some days it would be a yellow canal, while other days it would just look like mud.


What We Need & What You Get
I Have Just Launched Part 2
I am more than half way close to my goal. Enterprise Bank has pledged 1000. I am looking to raise $2000 to complete the goal. Please go ro https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/veils-of-col... to contribute. Thank you

I am planning on raising $4,500 for this campaign. Contributing to this campaign will help me achieve multiple important steps in the re-installing of this piece, including but not limited to: repairing last seasons veils and creating new ones if needed, hiring an engineer to help me with the thermodynamics of the canal and installing the veils without damaging the historic building or the veils and without injury to me or to anyone else involved, 
The perks you will obtain if you contribute to this campaign are as followed;

$5 Postcard 
$15 Postcard and stickers
$30 T-shirt
$50 Postcard and a mug


$75 A tote bag
$150 a mug and a tote bag
$250 a mug tote bag and a t-shirt
$500 a t-shirt and tickets for the canal tour
$1000 Lunch with me in my loft and a personalized tour for 10 people of the canal

All of the merchandise given with the perks will be adorned with an abstract graphic of the veils. The postcard will have a photo of the veils from last season's installation.
This installation will be happening whether I meet my goal or not. If I do not reach my goal, I will be forced to pull back on the installation.


Risks & Challenges
After having done this installation before I am prepared to face the risks I faced last year, and I will be more equipped this time around. I am going to be hiring an engineer to help me with a lot of the challenges I faced, including dealing with the thermodynamics of the canal, figuring out the best solution for installing the veils on the building without damaging it as it is historic, and overcoming the 30 feet high installation on unsteady ground. Having an engineer will make the installation process go much smoother than it had in the past, therefore making me very well prepared.

Other Ways You Can Help

If you are unable to contribute to this cause, please help us in another way by sharing this campaign with others through the Indiegogo sharing tools.
If you are willing to help physically, we are also looking for volunteers for the installation of this piece!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

While at Vermont Studio Center I will engage in research and create new prints and photographs for upcoming exhibitions. During this residency I will give an artist lecture that is open to the public and will participate in studio visits with other artists and writers.</p><p>(<strong>See perk images below.

My studio practice is rooted in the contemporary art practices of printmaking/print media. In my studio I utilize printmaking/print media and relief sculpture. I choose objects to cast, photograph, and print that possess a pleasant sort of uselessness, spirited artifice, or aggressive cheeriness. Candy colored extension cords power nothing, banner flags celebrate a phony patch of grass, and casts of Jell-O molds become the epitome of nature tamed. These displays point to the heaviness of gravity, my body and the fallacy of human dominance/mastery over nature.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sundowner Safari is a passionate crew of longtime Burning Man vets from South Africa and Brooklyn. We've been on core teams for major art cars like Heart Phoenix (2013/14) and large-scale installations like The Wedge (2009).</p>
<p>Earlier this year we traveled to South Africa and went on a life changing wildlife safari. We would end each day with ""Sundowners"", a fantastic tradition of sharing stories, laughter, and drinks with friends old and new.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502742984/q7yl9cy4gpb0echhp82o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're creating a safari-themed art car because we're passionate about bringing this special cultural ritual to the Burning Man community and beyond. We feel experiences of inclusion and camaraderie are exceedingly vital in these times. We also want to raise awareness for the world's unique ecologies and give back, in small part, where we can. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>It's an honor to put in the sweat to make this project happen. Indiegogo funds will go directly towards the costs to build the art car. Our hope is that this becomes an ongoing project, roaring back to the playa yearly. We'd love nothing more than for you to hop on board for the ride!</span></p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Art Car</h3>
<p>South Africa is one of the world's great melting pots. We want to radically express that in an art car combining an iconic safari land cruiser with the whimsy of a giant toy mutant vehicle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502468066/ayszpj50b6bbgf68dscf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our project has been approved by Burning Man's department of mutant vehicles. We're building the art car on a standard cargo van chassis.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503194546/y9mfrowdzfwlo9h5g5ss.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Key construction steps will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sawzall removal of passenger area</li>
<li>Seating installation for 17-20 passengers</li>
<li>Wind-safe, steel framed shade structure installation</li>
<li>Entryway and safety railing installation</li>
<li>Front hood ""tracker's chair"" and bike rack installation</li>
</ul>
<p>The specifications for our vision have been drawn up by an insanely experienced art car builder.</p>

<p>Sundown Safari has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure it can withstand the rigors of the desert and provide maximum safety to participants.</p>

<p>A mix of African fabrics, faux fur, and handmade or stuffed animals will amp up the art car's rad factor. These items will be tied down or secured with pop rivets or silicone glue and wind tested.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502469172/fhsk6uznzfmixdzdlfdf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Vehicle lighting for night missions will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moveable round spotlight on hood</li>
<li>LED light bars on shade structure, roof, and hood</li>
<li>Rear spotlight</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Summary
Sundowner Safari is a passionate crew of longtime Burning Man vets from South Africa and Brooklyn. We've been on core teams for major art cars like Heart Phoenix (2013/14) and large-scale installations like The Wedge (2009).
Earlier this year we traveled to South Africa and went on a life changing wildlife safari. We would end each day with ""Sundowners"", a fantastic tradition of sharing stories, laughter, and drinks with friends old and new.  

We're creating a safari-themed art car because we're passionate about bringing this special cultural ritual to the Burning Man community and beyond. We feel experiences of inclusion and camaraderie are exceedingly vital in these times. We also want to raise awareness for the world's unique ecologies and give back, in small part, where we can. 
It's an honor to put in the sweat to make this project happen. Indiegogo funds will go directly towards the costs to build the art car. Our hope is that this becomes an ongoing project, roaring back to the playa yearly. We'd love nothing more than for you to hop on board for the ride!

Art Car
South Africa is one of the world's great melting pots. We want to radically express that in an art car combining an iconic safari land cruiser with the whimsy of a giant toy mutant vehicle.

Our project has been approved by Burning Man's department of mutant vehicles. We're building the art car on a standard cargo van chassis.

Key construction steps will include:

Sawzall removal of passenger area
Seating installation for 17-20 passengers
Wind-safe, steel framed shade structure installation
Entryway and safety railing installation
Front hood ""tracker's chair"" and bike rack installation

The specifications for our vision have been drawn up by an insanely experienced art car builder.

Sundown Safari has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure it can withstand the rigors of the desert and provide maximum safety to participants.

A mix of African fabrics, faux fur, and handmade or stuffed animals will amp up the art car's rad factor. These items will be tied down or secured with pop rivets or silicone glue and wind tested.

Vehicle lighting for night missions will include:

Moveable round spotlight on hood
LED light bars on shade structure, roof, and hood
Rear spotlight

We are also exploring the use of programmable LED Nanoleaf lighting, resources permitting. 


Our Ask
We are trying to raise at least $5,000 to offset costs of the art car. It breaks down like this:

$2,500 - Outsourced Professional Labor
$2,500 - Base Vehicle, Fees & Transport
$1,000 - Decoration & Soft Materials
$800 - Vehicle Modification Parts
$500 - Electrical & Lighting
$400 - Construction Needs
$400 - Design Engineering
$8,100 - Total

Of course, we are volunteering our time for art car planning, construction, transportation, and storage. We are also covering associated costs, like build team accommodation, out-of-pocket and independent of this fundraiser.
Sundowner Safari is also an approved Burning Man theme camp where we will be holding scheduled events, but funds raised will go towards the art car.

<h2><strong>Présentation du projet</strong></h2>
<p>Étant à la base, graphiste de formation, le côté « graphique » en art m’interpelle de plus en plus. Je suis d’ailleurs actuellement inscrite au <i>baccalauréat en arts plastiques à l'UQTR </i>dans le but de perfectionner la dimension « graphique » de ma pratique. J’aimerais donc poursuivre mes recherches avec l’<strong>argile liquide</strong> afin d’utiliser la barbotine en la colorant, en la transformant, en y ajoutant des textures afin qu’elle serve non pas de « pâte » à sculpture comme je l’ai utilisée jusqu’à maintenant, mais qu’elle devienne plutôt une sorte de « <strong>peinture</strong> » pour en faire des tableaux et/ou des <i>graffitis</i>. En fait j’aimerais explorer ce type de médium de trois manières différentes, mais en parallèle l’une avec l’autre :<br/>- Créer des tableaux et/ou des <i>graffitis </i>en argile liquide colorée et <strong>crue</strong><br/>- Créer des tableaux et/ou des <i>graffitis</i> en argile liquide colorée et <strong>cuite</strong><br/>- Créer des tableaux et/ou des <i>graffitis</i> en argile liquide colorée, <strong>crue et<br/>cuite</strong> à la fois.</p>
<p>Outre la recherche dans la matière avec la terre liquide pour la travailler au pinceau, à la spatule et/ou avec tout autre instrument pouvant bien se prêter à la tâche, s’ajoute également la<br/>recherche d’enduits qui serviront à « fixer » l’argile crue. J’aimerais, avec ce projet, innover dans la façon d’utiliser l’argile de manière plus picturale, mais aussi, de pousser mes recherches sur le potentiel et les avantages de travailler avec de l’argile crue principalement.</p>
<h2><strong>Apport de la résidence à ma carrière artistique</strong></h2>
<p>Il est évident qu’une résidence d’artiste comme celle qui est offerte à l’<i>Institut européen des<br/>arts céramiques en Alsace</i> s’avérera, pour ma carrière artistique, un apport majeur au niveau<br/>de ma recherche artistique et guidera le cours de ma carrière par la suite. Accepter de partager de soi et de sa vision à l’étranger c’est aussi accepter de se laisser toucher et influencer par la vision de l’autre. Tout cela ne peut être que bénéfique pour la pensée, pour l’évolution de l’artiste que je suis ainsi que pour mon expérience personnelle et humaine. Un peu comme on dit qu’il est bon d’apprendre de plusieurs professeurs, je pense qu’il est aussi essentiel de voir et d’observer les façons de faire d’artistes et d’artisans d’ailleurs. L’échange d’idées, de visions et de façons de faire ne peut qu’enrichir l’un et l’autre. Au niveau plus individuel, je pense que le fait de pouvoir m’arrêter de mon quotidien et être plusieurs semaines à créer et à explorer de nouvelles avenues dans ma pratique artistique ne pourra que me donner des ailes et m’enligner sur la ligne directrice que je souhaite donner à ma carrière artistique dans les prochaines années. S’arrêter, réfléchir, explorer, se tromper, recommencer... c’est un « luxe » que je m'offre en allant à cette résidence.</p>
<p>À mon retour, j'aimerais créer des ateliers pour que les gens aux prises avec une problématique de santé mentale puissent s'exprimer au moyen de l'art, de l'argile liquide, des graffitis! J'aimerais donner une voix à ces gens pour qu'ils puissent s'initier et s'exprimer afin d'embellir et d'éduquer la communauté dans laquelle nous vivons. L'art public, le ""street art"" et tout ce qui enrichit notre communauté devraient pouvoir vivre et refléter les enjeux de toute la société. La santé mentale et les gens qui doivent se battent chaque jour contre les limites que leurs ""démons"" personnels veulent leur imposer n'en sont pas excluent. Leur donner une voix, démystifier les différentes problématiques de santé mentale, en parler, s'exprimer, éduquer, s'inspirer et créer... voilà ce que j'aimerais faire de ces ateliers et des expositions qui pourraient en découler. </p>
<h2><strong>DÉMARCHE ARTISTIQUE</strong></h2>
<p>L’argile constitue mon médium de prédilection. Je travaille la pièce unique de manière<br/>sculpturale et installative en mettant l’accent sur la terre nue, voire même crue. Le contraste de<br/>textures ou de matériaux est une constante dans mon travail. J’installe aussi une ambiance et<br/>un climat de tension afin de déstabiliser et de confronter le spectateur. L’humain, son comportement, ses réactions, ses interactions et ses émotions sont au coeur de<br/>ma recherche artistique. Mon travail révèle la part de l’ombre que nous portons tous et qui se<br/>reflète sur nos comportements sociaux. Les sujets « tabous » ou « sensibles » dans la société<br/>sont la pierre angulaire de mon inspiration. Je pense aux problématiques en santé mentale principalement (par exemple la phobie sociale et l'anxiété tout particulièrement), mais aussi aux relations toxiques ainsi qu’à certains enjeux féministes, dont l’hypersexualisation des jeunes filles. Idéalement, je veux que mon travail puisse participer à l’ouverture et au dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>BIOGRAPHIE</strong><br/>Née en 1974 à Ste-Thècle dans la région de la Mauricie, je suis maintenant installée dans la ville de Québec depuis le début des années 1990. C’est en 1994 que j'ai débuté ma formation universitaire en art en entreprenant un <i>certificat en Arts plastiques </i>que j'ai complété, en 1997, par un <i>baccalauréat en Communication graphique </i>à l'université Laval de Québec. Mère de trois enfants, je me suis un peu éloignée de la création pendant quelques années. J'y suis revenue en 2008 en entreprenant, à temps partiel, une <i>Technique en métiers d’arts </i>(option céramique) au Cégep de Limoilou que j'ai terminé en 2015. J'ai vu, dans mes études, une façon de m’approprier et de développer de manière très personnelle, les possibilités que me donne l’argile comme médium principal pour travailler la sculpture. J'ai développé, par ailleurs, une technique bien à moi en travaillant l'argile liquide et crue en l’amalgamant avec du papier. Mes recherches, en ce sens, m'ont valu de vendre quelques sculptures « non cuites » à des collectionneurs, dès la fin de mes études. Installée d’abord dans un atelier collectif, j'ai aménagé par la suite un atelier dans mon domicile de Québec lorsque l’atelier collectif s'est vu dans l’obligation de fermer ses portes. J'ai vacillé alors entre la fabrication d’objets utilitaires en céramique et la recherche en art visuel. Influencée par des artistes comme Beth Cavener Stichter, David Altmedj et plusieurs autres pour qui l’art est l’émetteur direct d’un propos fort porté par l’artiste, je tends à faire de mon art une porte ouverte sur la réflexion de thèmes plutôt tabous, mais bien présents dans la société. Toujours à l’affut de me perfectionner et dans le but de créer avec différents types de médiums, j'ai entrepris, à temps partiel en septembre 2017, un <i>baccalauréat en Arts visuels (arts plastiques) à l’Université du Québec </i>à Trois-Rivières. L’apport de techniques plus poussées dans les domaines davantage graphiques me donnera de nouvelles assises pour ma création en 2D et en 3D.</p>

<p>Looking into the portal side of Gracie &amp; out through her eyes.<strong>   </strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Creative Journey of this Piece Now Includes Others</strong></h3>
<p>Amazing Gracie is now ready for gold plating!  When quotes for gold plating come back that make you think you could buy a small car instead, ""faux finish"" comes to mind. However, when one thinks ""Oprah"", one does not think “faux gold”, one simply thinks ""gold"". At this point I took my hands off the wheel. The next day I was guided to create this fundraising campaign. Not knowing what I could possible give back to everyone in return, The Book of Gratitude idea came to me. This piece seeks to gather more hearts in the giving, expanding the love, gratitude, and other prayers woven within it. This gift now includes others in a way I could never have imagined. As I began the endeavor of a public campaign, I realized I could include many of my creations as pledges as well and so here we are. By making a pledge towards gold plating Amazing Gracie, you can become part of this unique gift (literally giving the gift of gold!)</p>
<h3><strong>A Few Reasons Gracie is Amazing!   </strong></h3>
<p>Gracie is now a mystical portal sculpture of woven prayers. Through simple intention, times hundreds of meditative working hours Gracie did not disappoint! She is quite the doggie-door portal. A magical example of what I call “inversion sculptures” and have named “Portal Pieces or Portraits”. When viewed from the portal side, Amazing Gracie’s face seems to optically come alive. Her heart shaped chakras sprang from her like bubbles when I was creating her. I recognized that they represent the importance of congruency in mind, heart, and word. Some of her many prayers are gratitude, forgiveness, surrender, playfulness and love.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My name is Rae Vavra, artist and jewelry designer from Los Angeles, California. I have exhibited my Art and designs throughout the LA area, as well as teaching Art since 1989. </span></p><p></p>
<p><span style="""">In 2007, I moved to Bali where I began to develop Ndiginus, an Art and Jewelry design venture that promotes the lost Art of Balinese beadwork, as well as creating fair trade jobs for these local craftsmen, while keeping this unique craft alive. I started this as an experiment by asking one craftsman to do beadwork on a piece of fabric as a sample, and now I employ four craftsmen each with his or her own unique skill.</span></p>
<p><b>About my project and the Ndiginus Team</b></p>
<p>I design all the accessories and make the first samples in my studio. I then work with each craftsman individually to reproduce my designs. Some designs are made by only one person, while others are made by the entire team. This process is a very rare hands on approach to creating one of a kind accessories, <span style="""">each one of these craftsman have now become an integral part of my team. I have been supporting this project solo from the beginning, but now, realize I need the support of a larger audience in order for Ndiginus to grow and prosper.</span></p>
<p><b>Why funding is needed for Ndiginus, immediate to 1 year goal</b></p>
<p><b>* </b>I've started this campaign to raise money for various reasons; the most basic reason is to buy supplies in order to continue producing my accessories, as well as paying the craftsmen who help me produce my designs.</p>
<p><b>*</b> The immediate 3 month goal is to continue marketing and sales throughout the Los Angeles area, as well as entering trade shows located within the LA fashion mart that target boutiques throughout the U.S. These shows will help promote and create orders for Ndiginus.</p>
<p><b>* </b>As profits increase, my 6 month to 1 year goal is to create a retail/workspace in Los Angeles that will house as a space for the design and marketing of Ndiginus, in a location clientele can easily access.</p>
<p><b>* </b>Funding is also needed to supply orders to the client, since deposits are not always possible with certain clientele, i.e. Boutiques. I will continue to do production in Bali, working with my current team of craftsman.</p>
<p><b>Long term goal</b></p>
<p>My long term vision is to use some of the profits from future sales to provide a larger space for my team to work from, supporting a creative group effort. This new space will be a sustainable design project built from Bamboo combining an indoor/ outdoor environment. The space will also host educational arts and crafts projects for the surrounding communities.</p>

</div></div>","A Bit About the Artist, Creator of Ndiginus

My name is Rae Vavra, artist and jewelry designer from Los Angeles, California. I have exhibited my Art and designs throughout the LA area, as well as teaching Art since 1989. 
In 2007, I moved to Bali where I began to develop Ndiginus, an Art and Jewelry design venture that promotes the lost Art of Balinese beadwork, as well as creating fair trade jobs for these local craftsmen, while keeping this unique craft alive. I started this as an experiment by asking one craftsman to do beadwork on a piece of fabric as a sample, and now I employ four craftsmen each with his or her own unique skill.
About my project and the Ndiginus Team
I design all the accessories and make the first samples in my studio. I then work with each craftsman individually to reproduce my designs. Some designs are made by only one person, while others are made by the entire team. This process is a very rare hands on approach to creating one of a kind accessories, each one of these craftsman have now become an integral part of my team. I have been supporting this project solo from the beginning, but now, realize I need the support of a larger audience in order for Ndiginus to grow and prosper.
Why funding is needed for Ndiginus, immediate to 1 year goal
* I've started this campaign to raise money for various reasons; the most basic reason is to buy supplies in order to continue producing my accessories, as well as paying the craftsmen who help me produce my designs.
* The immediate 3 month goal is to continue marketing and sales throughout the Los Angeles area, as well as entering trade shows located within the LA fashion mart that target boutiques throughout the U.S. These shows will help promote and create orders for Ndiginus.
* As profits increase, my 6 month to 1 year goal is to create a retail/workspace in Los Angeles that will house as a space for the design and marketing of Ndiginus, in a location clientele can easily access.
* Funding is also needed to supply orders to the client, since deposits are not always possible with certain clientele, i.e. Boutiques. I will continue to do production in Bali, working with my current team of craftsman.
Long term goal
My long term vision is to use some of the profits from future sales to provide a larger space for my team to work from, supporting a creative group effort. This new space will be a sustainable design project built from Bamboo combining an indoor/ outdoor environment. The space will also host educational arts and crafts projects for the surrounding communities.
Thank you for reading my story about Ndiginus, all contributions are greatly appreciated, please read on to view the perks for my campaign.

</div></div>","Flexible solution for my problem


Hello I am Rasto (or Visiohand :-) from Slovakia. Led underlighting is my great hobby. When I finished the  underlighting  of my ceiling with low installation height, I saw the errors on edges of the boards with overhang. So I need to  hide these defects on shaped and bent drywall and hide the led strip. Profiles that are on the market can bend only to some extent and require wet processes to finish and are very short for bigger lighting zones. So I decided to try out my own solution for this problem and create something more than just a profile. Solution with specific shape, construction and material. Something simple, cheap and new.






 some defects on the drywall corner. 


THIS IS LEDLEM SOLUTION AND LEDLEM ATMOSPHERE
THIS IS LEDLEM PROFILE


Examples for using the LEDLEM: for drywall constructions in interior, for exhibition stands, advertising, for creating solitaire lamps, underlighting thin frames, boards, TV and so on. Everywhere where is a plate with overhang and you want to hide the edges. Please see the examples in our gallery. And if you get bored with effect you can exchange it for another. Or you can buy custom LEDLEM with your idea (text, name, symbol, silhouette, pattern, idea with which we'll help you) . It is simple. 








First 50m of LEDLEM
 
At first we need to produce 50 m of LEDLEM prototype but it requires the mold.  We would like to produce this mold in our country so we can take more control over the quality.


first 50m of ledlem with LED strip


After that we can go to the next steps.
What will we do with the funds if the campaign would be successful ?






From the 4th step we are planning to develop a LED strip with motion effect - LEDLEM survive with LEDLEM zone controller (or LEDLEM SMART controller) and application for smartphones with many effects for sharing. With this controller we can bring more live on your wall (see the sample in video gallery) and control all lighting zones. 



We want to work on LEDLEM step too. The profile and led strip for ground lighting with motion sensor. LED illuminates according to how you move around the strip. It may be very useful on stairs. 

All elements should be compatible and then they will be able to create even more effects. For example, we see the movement behind the wall with LEDLEM survive and LEDLEM step. Or you can make impressively clock. You can also connect to the TV for live ambient lighting, simulation of flashes, wind, waves..and etc.. Light atmosphere is unique..



Next we want to start to sale the final LEDLEM set and LEDLEM creation kit. We would like to do it before the end of 2015. Then we will be ready to fulfill our promises. 

final LEDLEM set for 50m and 5 lighting zones

final LEDLEM creation kit with custom plate until 50x50 cm



If the campaign is not successful, we will not stop working on it. At least in the first 50 meters of ledlem. 



Of course we appreciate each contributor that will help us to achieve this dream. Each contributor will be rewarded. Our rewards might look like this.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Wings of Eos emerged from the artist's desire to pay homage to those who help others to begin again. Formed around a pair of Fibonacci spirals that connote a heart shape, the Wings nod to the patterns connecting us all. The sculpture will be installed as a shrine at the 12:00 doorway in The Temple of the Golden Spike (Man Base) for Burning Man 2017.</p>
<p>The ""feathers"" that comprise the Wings are handprints traced and lasercut from four generations of the artist's matrilineal line. These handprint feathers are being decorated by friends and family as well as by pARTicipants at events like Precompression. Thus, these Wings are pure hands-on art, a truly collaborative experience.</p>
<p>The hope and aim of the Wings of Eos is to remind those who pass by of how they are supported by those around them, of the possibility of starting over, and of the strength and power that comes from connection.</p>
<p>The Wings of Eos received an honorarium from the Burning Man organization, for which our Team is deeply grateful. The honorarium is estimated to cover about 1/3 of our cost, so we need your help in order to bring this piece Home.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To finish the piece, we need an additional $2500. This will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood, wood, and more wood (nearly 1000 handprint feathers plus structural wood)</li>
<li>Art supplies</li>
<li>Construction supplies</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Safety equipment</li>
<li>Packing and transportation costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are what your donations will gift to this shrine alongside the awesome little perks we offer to thank you for your support:</p>
<ul>
<li>For $10, we can make 16-20 handprint ""feathers.""<ul><li>If you support us at the $10 level, we'll give or send you a handmade necklace with an inscribed ""Wings of Eos"" handprint ""feather,"" either to be delivered on-playa (if we know and/or can find you) or mailed in October.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>For $25, we can make 50 handprint ""feathers"" or buy one sheet of structural plywood.<ul><li>For support at this level, we'll send you a lovely pair of wooden handprint ""feather"" earrings. These will be mailed in October. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>For support at the $30 level, we'll send you both the necklace and the earrings!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For $50, we can build 1/4 of the structure of a wing, seal 1/4 of a wing to protect the feather-art from the elements, or buy a top-quality router bit to cut big structural pieces on the CNC router.<ul><li>If you support us at this level, we'll send you something really special: an LED-illuminated wooden necklace crafted from a handprint ""feather"" and inscribed with ""Wings of Eos."" If you choose this perk by August 15, we commit to delivering (on- or off-playa!) or shipping this flashy-blinky thing to you before the start of Burning Man so that you can wear it out on the playa at night! We will be offering 30 of these only.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>For $100, our team can spend a day at TechShop, where we cut and assemble structural pieces as well as feathers.<ul><li>To thank you for your gift at this level, we'll send you a framed 5x7 photograph of the Wings of Eos on-playa, to be delivered in October along with a wooden feather necklace.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>For $250, we can purchase 1"" maple plywood from which to cut the main Fibonacci support brackets as well as the base. This amount of support also goes a long way toward safely packing and transporting a Wing to the Playa.<ul><li>To express our gratitude for your support at this highest level, the artist will custom-craft a beautiful pin for you in celebration of hands-on art. It will be approximately 4""x3"" and made of tiny handprint feathers cut that will be colored, decorated, sealed, and layered as they are on the Wings of Eos. This gift will be delivered in November. What a great holiday gift for those who support collaborative, hands-on art! Only 6 available.</li></ul>

You give some, we all give some...

Being a very passionate photographer and person in general I am really excited about starting this project! For a long time I have been thinking about a way to give back to the world instead of just asking for help for my personal goal.

Imagine
your favourite café: that cosy spot where you like hanging out with
friends in the evening, or having a morning coffee break, or
whatever.</p>
<p>
Now
spice it up with cool music, beautiful decorations,
comfy cushions, healthy food and drinks... anything you may need to
feel relaxed and happy.  Put it on four wheels... and you have the
VegArt Van!</p>
<p>
From
the wish to make people feeling good, the Veg Art Van
concept was conceived.</p>
<p>
My
name is Jane and I'm a life-enthusiastic person. At the age of
18 I quit my comfort zone (which didn't really make me comfortable!)
and started traveling around Europe.  It's been two years since then
and my passion about diversity, discovery and beauty has done nothing
but grow. What I mostly love is to challenge myself and others to do
better and be better.</p>
<p>
Have
you ever dreamed of traveling long-term across unexplored lands and
cultures?</p>
<p>
Have
you ever dreamed of meeting creative, positive and empowering people?</p>
<p>
Have
you ever dreamed of seeing others smile and thank you at a yummy dish
you've made with love and dedication for them?</p>
<p>
Have
you ever dreamed of seeing others close their eyes and dance at the
sound of your music and voice?</p>
<p>
This
is what the Veg Art Van dreams about.</p>
<p>
Can
you feel the excitement of such a great project?</p>
<p>
Well,
with your help you can make it real and even be a part of it!</p>
<p>
The
Veg Art Van aims at teaching people to enjoy life,  to be authentic
and caring about themselves and surrounding environment. Giving food
for thoughts, food for body and food for soul.</p>
<p><b>Hands-on:
what your contribution will be used for?</b></p>
<p>
The
current goal has been set on a very optimistic planning, but your
help will be very much appreciated even if only some of the following
steps will be achieved:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
	Approximately 6ooo €
	will be needed to purchase a second-hand campervan. Why buy a new
	one if new life can be given to old good vans too? Plus, the charme
	of vintage is irreplaceable!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Around
	4000 €
	will be required to make the necessary interior, exterior and
	mechanical restoration. A structural personalisation is essential to
	make up a unique concept as the VegArt Van is! That includes new insulation,
	new furnitures equipment, cooking tools, a sound system, detachable equipments for an outdoor siesta area for guests, and many more little details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

your favourite café: that cosy spot where you like hanging out with
friends in the evening, or having a morning coffee break, or
whatever.

Now
spice it up with cool music, beautiful decorations,
comfy cushions, healthy food and drinks... anything you may need to
feel relaxed and happy.  Put it on four wheels... and you have the
VegArt Van!

From
the wish to make people feeling good, the Veg Art Van
concept was conceived.

My
name is Jane and I'm a life-enthusiastic person. At the age of
18 I quit my comfort zone (which didn't really make me comfortable!)
and started traveling around Europe.  It's been two years since then
and my passion about diversity, discovery and beauty has done nothing
but grow. What I mostly love is to challenge myself and others to do
better and be better.

Have
you ever dreamed of traveling long-term across unexplored lands and
cultures?

Have
you ever dreamed of meeting creative, positive and empowering people?

Have
you ever dreamed of seeing others smile and thank you at a yummy dish
you've made with love and dedication for them?

Have
you ever dreamed of seeing others close their eyes and dance at the
sound of your music and voice?

This
is what the Veg Art Van dreams about.

Can
you feel the excitement of such a great project?

Well,
with your help you can make it real and even be a part of it!

The
Veg Art Van aims at teaching people to enjoy life,  to be authentic
and caring about themselves and surrounding environment. Giving food
for thoughts, food for body and food for soul.
Hands-on:
what your contribution will be used for?

The
current goal has been set on a very optimistic planning, but your
help will be very much appreciated even if only some of the following
steps will be achieved:



	Approximately 6ooo €
	will be needed to purchase a second-hand campervan. Why buy a new
	one if new life can be given to old good vans too? Plus, the charme
	of vintage is irreplaceable!



	Around
	4000 €
	will be required to make the necessary interior, exterior and
	mechanical restoration. A structural personalisation is essential to
	make up a unique concept as the VegArt Van is! That includes new insulation,
	new furnitures equipment, cooking tools, a sound system, detachable equipments for an outdoor siesta area for guests, and many more little details.



	The
	next 2000 €
	are
	required to accomplish all the bureaucratic procedures (!!) such as
	getting authorizations to food handling, to offer a service on the public ground, to insure the van, and so on.


The
	remaining 3000€
	will be all spent for marketing and merchandising... of course this last one is not essential to the launch of the project, however it would make it extremely easier. The more you
	contribute, the more we're going to give resonation to this project!

Any kind of help from you will be truly appreciated.If you don't want to make a donation, or you can't afford it, still there's a very quick and cheap way you can support the VegArt Van Project: spread the word!Share this page and the video on your socials, talk about it to as many people as you can! And remember that even making a little donation we'll thank you with nice perks!Please notice that some perks, especially higher ones, will require longer time to be available, as they depend completely on the success of the campaign and the effective launch of the project.

<div>
<p>In the year
2015, the Cyprus’ Ministry of Culture launched a special program in order to
support artistic events. The program was imaginatively called “Culture”.</p>
<p>  Everybody knows that culture, not
only as a ministry, but as a ministry’s program as well, can easily be turned
into a really weird situation. </p>
<p>  However, the fact that the state
wanted to help artists in their various ventures, especially during an era of financial
crisis, was a reason for us to feel encouraged.</p>
<p>  A title, or the epilogue, for all
these, could be “Great Expectations”, but let’s carry on with our story. </p>
<p>  Those days, we had already scheduled
an event called “Street Art Square”. It would happen in Paphos, at a central
parking lot of our town, where we would create some street artwork, and
transform the place into an open art gallery.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451233705/da1lv8nxw83pqbflys3d.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 310px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>  The participants wouldn’t be just
local artists, but, also, artists from other cities of Cyprus, and from all over
the world. This, as one can understand, raised the financial cost of the event,
but we decided that it was worth it, so we proceeded.</p>
<p>  We had our faith not only to God,
and various universal conspiracies, but to state’s help as well. So, we wrote a
letter, on behalf of Paphos’ Letters &amp; Arts Association, asking our event
to be considered as part of that special program called “Culture”.  </p>
<p>  Our main thought was: Why the hell
not?</p>
<p>  So, we asked for sponsorship, a good
old habit that was introduced by ancient Greeks, and became extremely famous
during eras like the Renaissance. </p>
<p>  One can think, again, the “Great
Expectations” factor – but hold your horses. </p>
<p>  Since we are old friends with
bureaucracy, our application form arrived at the Ministry of Culture long
before the expiration date; yet, we made a phone call to them, just in case
something had gone wrong. </p>
<p>  The phone was answered by the civil
servant responsible for the applications regarding painting etc. Let’s call this
servant Pete. It’s such a nice name. </p>
<p>  So, Pete let us know that he had
received our application form, and that it was properly filled. He also said that
our proposal was up to the Ministry’s demands. </p>
<p>  Most importantly, Pete announced
that the Ministry’s Cultural Services would answer the soonest possible,
probably until the end of March, and, in any case, before our event – which was
scheduled for April 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, it seems that
bureaucracy had other plans, so no one bothered enough to send us an answer.
That’s OK: shit happens.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451315612/c9vkrfbhhfo7flbckvlh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>  At that point, we decided to become
Pete’s best friends, and we called him in order to say so. Pete was so
flattered that promised to evaluate our application right after Easter
holidays. </p>
<p>  We felt sure that a guy like Pete
wouldn’t break such an important promise, and that’s why we proceed with our
event, which was warmly welcomed by the people of Paphos. </p>
<p>  To this day, we believe that the
Ministry was deeply touched, and excited by the success of our venture, but the
servants there must be fans of suspense, something that explains the fact that
April, and May passed without a single sign, or proof of life. </p>
<p>  Don’t worry, though: both the
Ministry, and Pete, are alive and kicking. </p>
<p>  However, we couldn’t be sure about
that, so we made some phone calls, in order to know that there hadn’t been any deadly
accidents in the Ministry. </p>
<p>  To be specific, we were so worried,
that we spoke 24 times, on the phone, with Pete, during a time of 4 months –
that’s more than we have spoken to the phone with most (if not all) of the
women that walked through our adventurous life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451233865/xtrfdwcflqi0y99jjlqu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  Perhaps we should mention the
unanswered phone calls as well, but who’s counting?</span><br/></p>
<p>  During the 24 conversations that
Pete was kind enough to have with us, he apologised for the delay, and he kept
assuring us that everything’s fine, and that soon enough we would receive the
final, and formal answer of the Ministry. </p>
<p>  Obviously, without the suspense
factor, our life would be unbearably boring.</p>
<p>  In July, after Pete analysed the
reasons of the delay, he made a striking revelation: he said that the Ministry
was capable of covering the 65-70% of our expenses, and he added that he was
talking informally. </p>
<p>  Pete emphasized at the word INFORMALLY,
and he also emphasized at the word SURE – meaning that he was sure that the
Ministry was capable of covering those expenses. </p>
<p>  So, according to the noble science
of maths, the Ministry would offer approximately 10.000 Euros, since the Street
Art Square’s entire cost had reached up to 17.000 Euros. </p>
<p>  Pete, our loyal phone friend,
explained us the exact way of transferring the money into the bank account, and
he constantly reassured us that everything would be taken care of really soon,
especially because the event had already taken place. </p>
<p>  So, every time we were saying
goodbye to him, he was promising that he would call us back himself, “on
Friday”, to let us know the final details. </p>
<p>  Pete, as we later discovered, is the
accurate type of guy, and that’s why he was never clear about which Friday he
meant: it could be the final Friday because the End of Days, and the
Apocalypse. </p>
<p>  That’s what the saying “ThankGodit’sFriday”
is all about.</p>
<p>  After a series of such blessed
Fridays, we reached the first days of August, when Pete was getting ready to go
on vacations. Then, he shared with us his honest hope that everything would be
over before his vacation. </p>
<p>  Obviously, hope dies when everyone
goes on vacation, leaving hope locked inside their office, bound to starve to
death.</p>
<p>  Since then, Pete hasn’t answered our
phone calls, and no one knows why; he may was too suntanned during summer, or
he decided that he didn’t love us any more – everything’s possible. </p>
<p>  On September 6<sup>th</sup>, in the year 2015, Paphos’
Letters &amp; Arts Association received an answer from the Ministry’s Cultural
Services, which announced that, after all, our application was rejected, and no
money would be given for our event. </p>
<p>  That’s happy ending, but we are not
over yet. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F150103755&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F150103755&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F549491755_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>  The answer, in Ministry’s exact words, was that: “The
venture proposed activates a wide range of artistic force, and disperse Art in
Citizen’s everyday life. However, the lack of a clearly stated thinking weakens
the initial intention”.</p>
<p>  We know that good intentions lead
straight to Hell. The weakened ones lead us to the nearest drugstore, for wine,
and cigarettes, and that’s if we’re lucky.</p>
<p>  Obviously, culture is a clear stated
thinking, just like William Blake’s poems. </p>
<p>  In this heartbreaking marathon, our
application form won the 37<sup>th</sup> place, with 79.75 points; yet, we are
not sure about the evaluation scale: it was the Richter one, the Celsius, or
the Fahrenheit? </p>
<p>  We’ll never know, and that’s
suspense for you, guys, as well as for us.</p>
<p>  The sponsorship was given only for the first 24 places
of the marathon, since the tanks of money went empty after that. That’s
understandable: we feel empty after that, as well.</p>
<p>  Let us say, just for the sake of
future history, that the Organisation of PAPHOS2017 agreed to cover the 15-20%
of the expenses for the Street Art Square, which had taken place with the
support of Paphos’ Letters &amp; Arts Association.</p>
<p>  At this moment, after covering a
part of the 17.000 Euros which is the entire cost of our event, it is really
urgent for us to find the amount of 5.500 Euros. </p>
<p>  These 5.500 Euros is the money we
spent for the materials, the documentary, the photo-shooting of the event, the
plane tickets, and the meals for the foreign artists, as well as the various
other means needed for our venture (lights, stage, sound system for the
concert, promo material like flyers etc). needless to say that all artists worked with out any compensation, all in a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>  The curator of the Street Art
Square, Y.S. is currently indebted to the artists for their tickets, and to the
various services that helped us throughout the venture.</p>
<p>  This Crowdfunding effort is our
best chance to pay our debt, and that is why we are offering original works of
art to all of you that are interested in participating, by trusting us any
amount of money you want, and are able to give. </p>
<p>  If we manage to gather more money
than the 5.500 Euros of our debt, we are going to set up a similar artistic
venture during September 2016. </p>
<p>  If you allow us, and help us do
this, we will definitely send a NOT clearly stated invitation to our loyal friend Pete, and the Cyprus’
Ministry of Culture, just for the good old days’ sake.</p>
<p>  Needless to say that this invitation
will be signed by our true sponsors: You. the names of all the contributors will be added to the background of the next poster</p>
<p>  We sincerely thank you all in
advance for your help.</p>

<p>I am an emerging artist working to
build a career as an artist. I feel very enthusiastic about
the possibilities in the art field, ceramic art in particular. I am looking to start the new phase of my artistic career
with my own home studio. I have been fortunate enough to have facilities and
equipment available to me for over ten years. Now it is time for me to get out
on my own and build my own studio!</p>
<p>To do this I will need your help!  The money earned from this Indiegogo campaign  will be used build my studio and ceramics business.  I will
purchase tools, supplies and equipment for my home studio. I will first be making a bulk purchase of porcelain, get a small
kiln to fire the work, and other materials and furniture for my studio. </p>
<p>I have some great perks available if you would like to participate in my fundraising efforts. I will be making the orders as they come and as i get my studio set up. It can take a while to get enough work to fill a kiln , so it could take 1-3 months to get your orders. Orders received before the end of this 60 day Indiegogo campaign will definitely arrive in by the first week of December. <br/></p>

<p><b>About my work:</b></p>
<p>My ceramic work shows a portrait of the city in which I live. I make functional porcelain pieces illustrated with drawings and observations of the local environment. the illustrations bring attention to the beauty of the urban landscape, and show details of daily life that can often be overlooked.The elements depicted are representative and unique to the local urban landscape, a local can view the illustrations and recognize their city in the landmarks and buildings, yet the images are also vague enough that the non-local can also to relate to the imagery.<br/><br/>The muted color palate gives the work an unimposing quality, paired with clean lines and the contrast of glazed and unglazed surfaces the work has a sharp quality to hold the viewers attention. Function brings the viewer in contact with the illustrations giving them a chance to investigate the form, surface, and drawings. The viewer can identify with the scene and create their own narrative and relationship to the illustrations.</p>

<br/><p><b>About me:</b><br/></p>
<p>I have always shrived to bring art into
every part of my life. Born into a family of artists, my mother a painter, and
my grandparents have worked in ceramics for over 50 years. I place great
importance on having art objects in one's life, and have always known I would
find a career in the art field. Beginning with small projects in my

ceramic education and helped me to develop a unique voice and style. Whether

at University of Florida from 2010-2011. In 2011 I enrolled in the Masters of
Fine Arts program in ceramics at Louisiana State University receiving my degree
in 2014. After completing graduate school at LSU, I was awarded Fogleberg
Fellowship at Northern Clay Center her in Minneapolis. The fellowship at
Northern Clay Center has given me opportunity to gain valuable experience
teaching adult and youth classes. Northern Clay Center has given me a lively
and creative environment where I can focus on developing my body of work while

</div></div>","I am an emerging artist working to
build a career as an artist. I feel very enthusiastic about
the possibilities in the art field, ceramic art in particular. I am looking to start the new phase of my artistic career
with my own home studio. I have been fortunate enough to have facilities and
equipment available to me for over ten years. Now it is time for me to get out
on my own and build my own studio!
To do this I will need your help!  The money earned from this Indiegogo campaign  will be used build my studio and ceramics business.  I will
purchase tools, supplies and equipment for my home studio. I will first be making a bulk purchase of porcelain, get a small
kiln to fire the work, and other materials and furniture for my studio. 
I have some great perks available if you would like to participate in my fundraising efforts. I will be making the orders as they come and as i get my studio set up. It can take a while to get enough work to fill a kiln , so it could take 1-3 months to get your orders. Orders received before the end of this 60 day Indiegogo campaign will definitely arrive in by the first week of December. 




About my work:
My ceramic work shows a portrait of the city in which I live. I make functional porcelain pieces illustrated with drawings and observations of the local environment. the illustrations bring attention to the beauty of the urban landscape, and show details of daily life that can often be overlooked.The elements depicted are representative and unique to the local urban landscape, a local can view the illustrations and recognize their city in the landmarks and buildings, yet the images are also vague enough that the non-local can also to relate to the imagery.The muted color palate gives the work an unimposing quality, paired with clean lines and the contrast of glazed and unglazed surfaces the work has a sharp quality to hold the viewers attention. Function brings the viewer in contact with the illustrations giving them a chance to investigate the form, surface, and drawings. The viewer can identify with the scene and create their own narrative and relationship to the illustrations.


About me:
I have always shrived to bring art into
every part of my life. Born into a family of artists, my mother a painter, and
my grandparents have worked in ceramics for over 50 years. I place great
importance on having art objects in one's life, and have always known I would
find a career in the art field. Beginning with small projects in my
grandparent's studio I have always had an affinity for ceramics. The influence
of the many instructors I have had over the years has given me a diverse
ceramic education and helped me to develop a unique voice and style. Whether
enrolled as a student or out of school I have remained committed to my
participation in the artistic community. I have also had opportunities to show
my work, in both solo and group exhibitions.

</h3> <p></p>Habitable Spaces is a community arts and agriculture project in which 
artists are invited to create large- scale interactive pieces while 
exploring alternate forms of living.  These artworks become installed as
 a permanent part of the farm, creating a space that becomes a more 
comprehensive and collaborative project with each successive year. 
Located in the tiny town of Kingsbury Texas , the Habitable Spaces 
artist residency program integrates cutting edge art and artists into a 
rural community, giving an opportunity for both artists and the local 
community to participate in a lively dialog. We emphasize engagement not
 only with the rural community, but with the landscape itself, asking 
artists to consider problems of drought, climate change and urban 
expansion in their proposed projects.<br/><br/><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP!<br/>
</h3> <p>Habitable
 Spaces received its non-profit status in December, and now we can 
really push forward to finish building the infrastructure of the farm 
and artist residences, and get this show on the road!!<strong><br/><br/><strong>WHEN WE RAISE $5,000:  </strong></strong>The
 first thing we will do is put in a culvert and a roadway system so that
 the public can easily access the farm to attend events, workshops and 
festivals.  <strong><strong><br/><br/><strong>WHEN WE RAISE $10,000:  </strong></strong></strong>We will 
use the next $5,000 to finish the infrastructure of the farm, digging 
water lines that will run to our kitchen, and down to our large garden, 
as well as the<strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong>many smaller perennial gardens that inhabit the area. <br/><strong><strong><strong><br/><strong>IF WE RAISE MORE THAN $10,000:  </strong></strong></strong></strong>You will really get us on our way!  We will use this money to 
build 5 small artist in residence cabins for local, national and 
international artists to occupy during their stay with us.<br/></p>
<p><b>YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL BE REWARDED:</b></p>
<p>Your donation 100% tax deductible!  In addition,  there are all kinds of perks to supporting Habitable Spaces.  Not only will you feel good about supporting the arts in a small rural community, we have t-shirts, koozies, ball caps, and an extravagant farm to table dinner at habitable spaces planned for generous donors.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We believe that there is a division
between the fine arts community and rural farming and ranching
communities.  Most opportunities for
artists lie in urban areas, creating an exodus of artists from small towns and
rural landscapes.  By creating Habitable
Spaces, we expose farmers and ranchers to fine art concepts while teaching
artists about concepts of homesteading and farming.  We ask artists to consider the problems that
face many farmers and ranchers today – water shortages, climate change, and urban
expansion, and to think about food production as well as shelter.  Artists are expected to create a project that
stays at Habitable Spaces, in this way becoming a part of a larger
collaborative architecture. These projects do not have to be sculptural in
nature – they can be conceptual, performance oriented, or through painting or
photography, but they must have a dialog with the space and the rural
surroundings.</p>
<p>Through our artist residency
program, Habitable Spaces serves as a platform for artists to research the
interactions between artistic practice, the shelter in which one is housed, and
the methods through which sustenance is obtained. In this way, we expose artists
to a lifestyle where sustenance is gained through farming, and a simplicity of
life that is dependent on the weather and landscape for productivity.  We also bring the art world into a rural
landscape, exposing farmers and ranchers to concepts and cultures that they do
not normally have access to.
</p>
<p>We hosted our first artists by invitation
in the fall of 2012.  These artists built
structures and did research on the property throughout the Winter Season.  In subsequent years, Habitable Spaces has
been able to invite artists, as well as performers and writers to have
residencies at the farm. During their time with us, artists research and create
projects that become a permanent part of the larger structure of Habitable Spaces.
We hope that through these additions, Habitable Spaces becomes a collectively
built sculptural space as well as a live space and sustainable farm.  In this way each project becomes part
sculptural, part performance and part an example of sustainable living.  </p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>YOU CAN SUPPORT IN MANY WAYS<br/>
</h3>There are many ways to support Habitable Spaces.  We always need volunteers to help us with farming, building, and maintenance.  Come on out to the farm and spend a day with us, you will be well fed, and in good company!<br/><br/>

Your donation 100% tax deductible!  In addition,  there are all kinds of perks to supporting Habitable Spaces.  Not only will you feel good about supporting the arts in a small rural community, we have t-shirts, koozies, ball caps, and an extravagant farm to table dinner at habitable spaces planned for generous donors.  
  The Impact 
We believe that there is a division
between the fine arts community and rural farming and ranching
communities.  Most opportunities for
artists lie in urban areas, creating an exodus of artists from small towns and
rural landscapes.  By creating Habitable
Spaces, we expose farmers and ranchers to fine art concepts while teaching
artists about concepts of homesteading and farming.  We ask artists to consider the problems that
face many farmers and ranchers today – water shortages, climate change, and urban
expansion, and to think about food production as well as shelter.  Artists are expected to create a project that
stays at Habitable Spaces, in this way becoming a part of a larger
collaborative architecture. These projects do not have to be sculptural in
nature – they can be conceptual, performance oriented, or through painting or
photography, but they must have a dialog with the space and the rural
surroundings.
Through our artist residency
program, Habitable Spaces serves as a platform for artists to research the
interactions between artistic practice, the shelter in which one is housed, and
the methods through which sustenance is obtained. In this way, we expose artists
to a lifestyle where sustenance is gained through farming, and a simplicity of
life that is dependent on the weather and landscape for productivity.  We also bring the art world into a rural
landscape, exposing farmers and ranchers to concepts and cultures that they do
not normally have access to.

We hosted our first artists by invitation
in the fall of 2012.  These artists built
structures and did research on the property throughout the Winter Season.  In subsequent years, Habitable Spaces has
been able to invite artists, as well as performers and writers to have
residencies at the farm. During their time with us, artists research and create
projects that become a permanent part of the larger structure of Habitable Spaces.
We hope that through these additions, Habitable Spaces becomes a collectively
built sculptural space as well as a live space and sustainable farm.  In this way each project becomes part
sculptural, part performance and part an example of sustainable living.  

    YOU CAN SUPPORT IN MANY WAYS
There are many ways to support Habitable Spaces.  We always need volunteers to help us with farming, building, and maintenance.  Come on out to the farm and spend a day with us, you will be well fed, and in good company!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<blockquote><h3>Support London Black Revolutionaries!</h3></blockquote>We are a young, black and political revolutionary and activist organisation that formed in 2014. <br/><br/>London Black Revs is a self-determined working class URBAN revolutionary and activist organisation. Our principles include anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-homophobia/transphobia and anti-fascism. <br/><br/>We engage in campaigns and offensives in all these areas. We are a democratic but militant organisation that fights oppression and exploitation, whether they are social, economic or political issues. <br/>We combine practical versatility, technology, self-emancipation, militant offensive and defensive direct action and full commitment to the struggle as cornerstones of London Black Revolutionaries. <br/><br/>Our organisation is for those who see nothing else but struggle and will not settle for anything less than a world rid of oppression and exploitation. We see the struggles of race, class, gender and sexuality bound together and we need to start fighting side by side when it comes to dismantling oppression and exploitation in the everyday lives of working class Black and Asian people. <br/><br/>We carry out direct actions which are useful to the community and people of London, such as the <a href=""http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/activists-vandalised-the-anti-homeless-spikes-this-morning"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Concreting over Tesco's Anti Homeless Spikes</a> as an immediate way of achieving our aims, either by economically crippling oppressive groups by shutting places down, or by sabotage/damage.

It will also cover the basics such as printing supplies, leaflets, meeting/travel costs, emergency responses, a homemade PA system, megaphones, radio equipment...</p>
<p>Funding is tantamount to the security of our movement, with just a little bit of funding, our members will be able to take all the precautions and have all the necessary bits and pieces when organising protests, demonstrations or carrying out political direct actions.

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>Axayacoatl (say Ah-Shy-ah-co-atul) is
a copper Quetzalcoatl head that stands 21' tall and will be displayed at
Burning Man 2015. Sinuous copper pipes covered in beaten copper skins form his
stylized head. This Aztec feathered serpent god has a translucent warrior in
his mouth, made of copper mesh. Participants standing inside the sculpture will
move massive levers and wheels to treat those outside to impressive shows of
flame effects and interactive lighting elements that will make Axayacoatl's
skin glow and ripple. </p>
<p>Partly funded by an honorarium grant
from Burning Man Arts, Axayacoatl needs your support to meet our full budget.
Our project is created with completely volunteer labor, so every penny you
donate goes to pay for materials, fuel and supplies. </p>

Other team members include co-lead and jeweler Nicole Gagne, interactive controls designer Brett Doar and numerous builders.</p>
<h2>Why Axayacoatl?</h2>
<p>Axayacoatl means ""Mask of the
Serpent"" in Nahuatl, the ancient tongue spoken by citizens of the Aztec
(or more properly, Mexican) civilization that centered in Tenochtitlan, the
world's most sophisticated and largest city of its time--when Cortez
encountered it in 1519. Capra became obsessed with Mexican culture when
studying natural building in Mexico in 2003, where she saw the incredible
murals at Cacaxtla and was struck by the magnitude of the civilization hosted
on this continent. The parallels between that culture and the art gifting,
dance-oriented ritualistic culture of Burning Man are striking. She wanted to
bring a piece of Mexico to Burning Man to remind people of our heritage as
North Americans, that our activities there are part of the heart and soul of
our continent, and to remind us that throughout time the choices we make are
what create our civilization and our legacy.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Since we are 70% through our build,
we are not worried about finishing the artwork, the centerpiece of this
campaign. Our biggest risk for the campaign is finding the time to package all
our rewards and get them sent out to you by August 15th. We have already
created a substantial number of the rewards. We will do our best to ship
everything we can before the event or to meet you on the playa with your rewards,
but please be patient with us, because finishing the artwork is our focus.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Please spread the word! Our own
networks are not enough to properly fund our artwork, but together we can reach
our goal.</p>
<p>Our team also needs donations of bicycles for the
interactive controls, so if you're in LA or San Francisco and have a bicycle
(any condition except completely rusted up) to donate, please reach out to us
and we'll coordinate an exchange!</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Over the last 30 years, Pakistan has seen a shrinking space for critical public expression and citizen engagement. Although electronic and social media have expanded the number of voices, still the voice of women, minorities, youth, transgender, labor, farmer, and the poor continue to be marginal in the mainstream discourse, which is but an interplay of few power players. Additionally, increased involvement in the virtual space has been at the expense of real physical citizen engagement.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Awami Art Collective is a group of concerned artists, academics and activists, who initially came together to engage citizens in a dialogue on violent extremism through public art. But soon recognized the importance of interlinkages between extremism, culture and development. We understand ‘development’ as a progression rooted in culture and heritage, and thus consider its contemporary implementation which has led to a lack of urbane culture and inequality as nothing but alienation and underdevelopment.</p>

<div>We thus intervene in the public space for the cause of peaceful co-existence, celebration of cultural diversity and inclusive development, while we employ non-hierarchical collaboration as our process of creation. Our aim is to appropriate the relationship between art and activism to generate public discourse as a catalyst for change.</div>

<h3>Request for Support</h3>
<p>We are currently working on two different initiatives: </p>
<p><strong>1. A Public Art Installation with the theme of displacement and development</strong>      Budget: $3,000</p>
<p>The installation will be informed by the 70th anniversary of the independence of Pakistan which led to one of the largest migrations in human history. It will link the past mass displacement with the current (urban) development paradigm, which disregards citizen’s right to shelter and livelihoods, community life and our intangible heritage. Thus questioning the very notions of our freedom and independence by asking: for whom is this development for if it displaces the same communities that had taken shelter here after the chaos of partition?</p>
<p><strong>2. A Book on public art, activism and community engagement     </strong>Budget: $5,000</p>
<p>South Asia has a rich tradition of public art which is weaved in our living culture, such as folk songs, truck art etc. However, the practice of public art is often considered a borrowed phenomenon from the West because of a lack of theorization of local practice. Awami Art Collective thus feels the urgent need to document and theorize its experience working in public space to explore how public art is practiced, viewed, and experienced by the community at large. By doing so, we want to initiate a discourse on public art domestically, and inform it at the regional and international level. We also consider this an important step towards bridging the gap between community and art through an analysis of the people’s reflections on public art. The book will include papers by both members &amp; non-members in English and Urdu, and will be designed by the Awami Art Collective.      </p>
<h3>Past Initiatives</h3>
<p><strong>1. Surkh Gulabaan Dey Mausam Wich Phulaan Dey Rang Kaaley - Black Spring  (2016)</strong></p>
<p>Black Spring is an installation of a 2000m long web of lights that traverses the roofs of old city homes where once Basant (an indigenous kite flying festival) used to be celebrated. This web of lights both laments Basant’s forgotten announcement of the coming of spring, as well as highlights the seizure of Lahore by urban development projects.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496077011/qivw5hvd4bh971scvsj5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The installation took a month to complete in partnership with the Taxali community in the Walled City of Lahore. The choice of Taxali was purposeful because it was the cultural heart of Lahore till its arts of music and dance were practically banned in the 1980s ensuing a slow death of its culture along with increasing the economic hardships for the artist community. The various urban development projects have further marginalized this community, eg. the revamped Manto Park into a gated pristine park took away cricket grounds from the youth. Taxali thus represents Lahore as the very character of this ancient city is now at risk because of the neglect of cultural heritage at the altar of morality and development.</p>
<p>The project was made possible through a crowd funding campaign in which $2,200 were raised. The installation was a success as it got extensive media coverage, which re-started the debate on the banning of Basant, and the government formed a Basant Committee to plan for Safe Basant. </p>

<p><strong>2.  Hum Jo Tareek Rahon Main Maaray Gaey  - We who were Slayed in the Dark Alleys (2015)  </strong></p>
<p>The objective of the installation was to commemorate civilian citizens who had been killed over the last 30 years because of their belief, ideas or profession. It meant to both educate the populace to the extent of belief based violence as well as provide an experience by which citizens could make a self-commitment to not again allow it in their midst.</p>

<p>The installation encompassed a 160 feet circular walkway with 127 different triangular buntings (jhandis), each representing a category of incidence of violence, placed in a chronological order from 1988 – 2015. The walkway culminated into a space inside the circle where a person could light an incense stick and say a prayer for those lost in the violence. The buntings were white in color representing the white part of the Pakistani flag signifying minorities, as a significant portion of those killed did not belong to the majority religious sect or ideology. Each bunting stated the name, date and the ideological reason for the targeted violence.</p>
<p>The installation was the first of its kind public art project in Lahore. It was installed in Bagh-e-Jinnah, one of the oldest and most visited parks of the city, in collaboration with the City District Government of Lahore. It was well received by the citizens, and initiated a debate on public art in Pakistan.</p>

</div></div>","Background
Over the last 30 years, Pakistan has seen a shrinking space for critical public expression and citizen engagement. Although electronic and social media have expanded the number of voices, still the voice of women, minorities, youth, transgender, labor, farmer, and the poor continue to be marginal in the mainstream discourse, which is but an interplay of few power players. Additionally, increased involvement in the virtual space has been at the expense of real physical citizen engagement.

In 2012 I won the title World Champion of Underwater Photography and my images were published and featured hundreds of times in magazines and books all around the world. My underwater image series of a submerged ""Dakota"" aircraft received numerous  awards and earned a place in the ""Top 5 Scuba Shots of 2013"" at PADI, the worlds biggest scuba training agency.</p><p>The past seven years has seen my work exhibited in seven photography art exhibitions. In 2015, I wrote two books about underwater photography for a German dive training agency. In the year 2014 I had the honor to be a lecturer for artistic underwater photography at the SAAR Academy of Fine Arts, Germany.</p><p>The first time I used a camera was in 1978. I have been hooked on the art of photography since. In 1996 I discovered scuba-diving and began to shoot images underwater. I have explored the oceans from the surface down to 260 feet, always on the hunt for significant subjects, situations and images.

Please check out http://www.songofsilence.com for further details. About meI am an independent photographer and my specialty is Aquatic Imaging, the art of imaging utilizing water as the key element of expression. In 2012 I won the title World Champion of Underwater Photography and my images were published and featured hundreds of times in magazines and books all around the world. My underwater image series of a submerged ""Dakota"" aircraft received numerous  awards and earned a place in the ""Top 5 Scuba Shots of 2013"" at PADI, the worlds biggest scuba training agency.The past seven years has seen my work exhibited in seven photography art exhibitions. In 2015, I wrote two books about underwater photography for a German dive training agency. In the year 2014 I had the honor to be a lecturer for artistic underwater photography at the SAAR Academy of Fine Arts, Germany.The first time I used a camera was in 1978. I have been hooked on the art of photography since. In 1996 I discovered scuba-diving and began to shoot images underwater. I have explored the oceans from the surface down to 260 feet, always on the hunt for significant subjects, situations and images.

stories of growth. This installation focuses on the forces required for transformation and healing. </p>
<p>While
using the canvas as an opportunity to visually journal the experience of her
sensations, Amanda, an artist, costume designer, a Fibromyalgia survivor, soon realized that the act of mapping her body in a sketchbook
allowed a visual and mental relationship to develop between her anatomy, and
the naturally occurring patterns found in all forms of life. This allowed her
mind to relate to the limbs of her body in a new way. Coupled with yoga and
therapy, new, unexpected space for amazing neuroplastic growth and healing was
created within her body, mind and spirit. </p>
<p>In
November 2014, Amanda had a chance to show her work in a one night only
installation entitled <i>FasciaFigures</i> at
FLOW Physical Therapy in NYC. Here, it was discovered that when seen
together, the images themselves tell a story of a continuous pattern of
destruction, growth, and transformation. Sharing emotional artwork was an
inspiring learning experience, and was direct motivation to investigate
further. </p>

<p><i>This </i>multi-sited, public art project is situated in various Chicago neighborhoods: Hyde Park, Garfield Park, Auburn Gresham, West Town, Ukranian Village, Humboldt Park, Near West Side, and Pilsen.

The Impact

This multi-sited, public art project is situated in various Chicago neighborhoods: Hyde Park, Garfield Park, Auburn Gresham, West Town, Ukranian Village, Humboldt Park, Near West Side, and Pilsen. The locations were chosen quite deliberately, as the communities are primarily located outside of areas that many would consider cultural centers. Truthfully, many of these neighborhoods are rich with vibrant culture yet are all too often overlooked. This project challenges Chicagoans to engage with the distance that is between the many and varied locales. Public programs like Amanda Williams IT'S A GOLD MINE/IS THE GOLD MINE, an extension of her Color(ed) Theory project, aim to engage residents in the communities that the projects are located by concentrating on the sites/parcels that have been vacated as a result of demolished Color(ed) Theory houses. Williams' primary question is—How can color be used to mark not just property, but
the value of the vacant parcels of land as well?
Martine Syms, Cheryl Pope, Lisa Alvarado, Ayanah Moor, Carris Adams, The Black Athena Collective, and Assaf Evron will produce work specifically for billboards in the aforementioned neighborhoods that will be accessible via train, bus, bike, car, and walking.

I invite you to participate in and support a community weaving project that I am organizing on


January 10th, 2016 in Denver, Colorado



Help create the second generation of Indra's Net

Wall of Women Colorado  will be hosting us at Ironton Studios just outside of downtown Denver. We are inviting the greater community of Denver to join us from 12 to 6pm to create Indra's Net as an intentional weaving.
We need everyone to bring a donation of clothing or fabric that can be stripped into lengths of at least 12 inches long for weaving in prayers and thoughts.  We are gathering to support the work being done by Wall of Women Colorado and to support ALL actions on climate change and keeping fossil fuels in the ground.
Together we act to protect the Earth for all our children and all future generations.






Wall of Women Colorado mission statement: a group of  people entrusted to protect the earth for future generations. They support the children as they challenge those who choose profit rather then preservation. 



This net woven of knotted fabrics became the first generation of Indra’s Net. It was begun and completed over several years moving through hands and communities from around the globe. Eventually it was hung at the 2011 Bioneers Conference in San Rafael, California.



As we continue with this new incarnation in Denver, we will weave a golden thread throughout the net to represent the kintsugi or “golden repair” that is present when we tend to the wounding of ourselves and of our planet. Repairing the cracks, tending to the wounds, creates strength and resiliency as in the container of Indra's Net where the ""jewels"" can be found at every node in the net. 
In early August 2015, at the same time that I was planning for this event, I learned of a toxic waste spill from an abandoned mine shaft near Silverton, Colorado. When I first  saw the dramatic aerial views of the winding, golden Animas River, I was devastated and discouraged about the healing potential of Indra's Net. Further consideration and a phone call to a friend and I was reminded that Animas means ""soul"" ~ the original meaning, the river of lost souls, rio de las animas. 
I often think of the soul of the world and how the creative act of collaboration is an empowering ritual. It is what I mean by  weaving the invisible. I deeply believe that the healing power of art and working in the invisible plane  leads to healing on this physical plane. 





This golden thread will honor the work being done to support the continued healing of the Animas River in western Colorado.

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>The artwork we are designing for PK will be created by a group of his artistic and architectural collaborators and colleagues. FLUX, the non-profit arts organization that PK helped found, will be the sponsor of the project and will be the steward of the funds raised through this campaign. As FLUX is a 501c3, <strong>all donations to this fund are tax-deductible</strong>. </p>
<p>We will be working on identifying a possible installation locations in the city of San Francisco over the next few months. As we narrow down our options for a location, we will begin to flesh out the design of the artwork. It is our hope that it can be -- like everything that FLUX has created -- a collaborative process in its design, fabrication, and installation. </p>
<p>The aim of the work will be to inspire awe and instigate connections between those who visit the work. This may take the form of a bench that allows people to sit together and take in a sweeping view; a sculpture that encourages both contemplation and conversation in a beautiful space; or a structure that provides gathering space and shade with whimsical and thoughtful details that echo its surroundings.</p>
<p>It's important to us that the artwork is installed in an outdoor space that is publicly accessible. PK's work often sought to evoke the natural world -- he looked to the landscape to find inspiration for and connection to the buildings and sculptures he helped design. It's our hope that what we create in his memory can be situated somewhere that allows people to take in the beauty of our city's landscape, something he truly loved. </p>

<h3>What you receive</h3>
<p>As part of this memorial artwork, we will be making a memento connected to the work for all our supporters. This object will be something small that you can keep with you as a memory PK and the joy and passion he brought to the world as a designer, artist, architect, instigator, and maker.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone who makes a donation of $50 or more will receive the memento. </strong></p>
</div></div>","About the project
The artwork we are designing for PK will be created by a group of his artistic and architectural collaborators and colleagues. FLUX, the non-profit arts organization that PK helped found, will be the sponsor of the project and will be the steward of the funds raised through this campaign. As FLUX is a 501c3, all donations to this fund are tax-deductible. 
We will be working on identifying a possible installation locations in the city of San Francisco over the next few months. As we narrow down our options for a location, we will begin to flesh out the design of the artwork. It is our hope that it can be -- like everything that FLUX has created -- a collaborative process in its design, fabrication, and installation. 
The aim of the work will be to inspire awe and instigate connections between those who visit the work. This may take the form of a bench that allows people to sit together and take in a sweeping view; a sculpture that encourages both contemplation and conversation in a beautiful space; or a structure that provides gathering space and shade with whimsical and thoughtful details that echo its surroundings.
It's important to us that the artwork is installed in an outdoor space that is publicly accessible. PK's work often sought to evoke the natural world -- he looked to the landscape to find inspiration for and connection to the buildings and sculptures he helped design. It's our hope that what we create in his memory can be situated somewhere that allows people to take in the beauty of our city's landscape, something he truly loved. 

What we need
We are looking for support in the following ways for this project: 

Financial support to fund the design, fabrication, and installation of the artwork (all donations are tax-deductible)
Connection to people at the San Francisco Arts Commission, the San Francisco Parks & Rec Department, and the Presidio Trust to discuss possibilities for installation


What you receive
As part of this memorial artwork, we will be making a memento connected to the work for all our supporters. This object will be something small that you can keep with you as a memory PK and the joy and passion he brought to the world as a designer, artist, architect, instigator, and maker.

<p><i><strong>Who am I?</strong></i></p>
<p>My name is Ivy Manska. I'm currently a student at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, MI. I will be graduating in May with a BFA in illustration with a minor in fine art. I draw, paint, and was recently acquainted with printmaking. </p>
<p>I spent last semester in Toronto as an exchange student, but I'm eager to explore further. I've always been attracted to Iceland for its otherworldly landscape, so I started applying for artist residencies there first. The following day I was pleasantly surprised to be offered an 80-day residency at the Heima residency in Seydisfjordur from August to October. </p>
<p><i><strong>A Call for Donation</strong></i></p>
<p>The residency is on an eastern fjord of Iceland located in a town with a population of around 600. I will be in a shared studio with 5 other artists from around the world. There are opportunities for gallery shows in Iceland as well as when I arrive home in October. I've yet to spend any prolonged period of time somewhere so isolated. I'm hoping this opportunity will benefit my personal growth, and strongly influence my artistic approaches.</p>
<p>I will come out of this residency with a fully developed body of work inspired by a multitude of subjects, but heavily influenced by experiences in Iceland. It offers landscapes and wildlife that more align with the work that I've made in the past and work that I want to continue creating. </p>
<p>Any donation will go towards the residency fee, travel costs, art supplies, and necessities. Donations would also go towards printing costs for any pieces I create on this adventure! For example, I hope to explore zine-making on this trip!</p>
</div><div>
<p><b><i>What You Get</i></b></p>
<p>For such a personal project, I wanted to be able to give back a product for those who can donate! I'm offering stickers, to prints, then original pieces. I'm open to suggestions for products, but I'm very limited on time as I'm currently in the last semester of my undergraduate program. </p>

<h2>Feel Your Feelings</h2>
<p>There was nothing like the lyrics of early 2000's emo songs that sparked imagery in my brain I just had to draw. For years, I've been making art from the lyrics of Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance, Dashboard Confessional, and so many more. This collection takes that love to the next level, with prints created by hand by yours truly. If you're like me, emo music makes you want to head bang and sing as loud as you can. Each design encapsulates that energy and intensity, romanticism and longing, so that you can carry it with you in a 5""x7"" package wherever you see fit.</p>
<p>Why now? Well, because soon I will be attending a coding bootcamp, and the tension and the terror of paying for it is real. Getting this campaign fully funded would mean graduating from a coding bootcamp without debt. For the past few years, I've worked for arts education nonprofits and at Patagonia, places with socially minded missions that I can truly stand behind. The freedom to continue this trend, and not just take a job to pay off a loan, is something I want to strive for. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>That's What You Get (When You Donate)</h3>
<p>You get a print that soothes your little emo kid soul, I get a little bit closer to my career goals.</p>
<p>I've been in a holding pattern, but that ends now. This summer, I'll be attending an immersive coding bootcamp in SF, which has a tuition of approximately $16k. (I know. I know.)</p>
<p>The program itself has a scholarship (currently applying for it) that covers $8k leaving me responsible for the last $8,000. This remaining tuition is where the funds raised here are headed, save the cost of creating and shipping the prints themselves. In the event more than $8,000 is raised, the rest will go towards living expenses in SF for the 3 months I'll be there. </p>
<p><i><u>But back to what YOU get!</u>  </i>Each of these designs has been a labor of love. They're crafted to convey the feeling of each lyric in its song, so that the experience of listening to the music and looking at the print are one and the same. I came up with each concept myself, drew them myself, and printed them myself (at local nonprofit <a href=""https://www.laikapress.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laika Press</a>!), so that no two are exactly alike. These prints are truly the best of me. </p>
<p>Check out the FAQ's for more details on the process!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Print Is Proof (I Know You Know)</h3>
<p>When you work at a desk, whether you're a student, a professional, or an artist, the space immediately around you takes on importance. For me, having a little inspiration around, in a bit of artwork, has always made a world of difference. These lyrics prints were crafted specifically to bring you the feel of the music with just a glance.  Maybe you can't rock out with all your might to that song right now, singing the chorus til the building shakes, air guitar held high, feet stomping to the beat. But you'll still get that feeling.</p>
<p>Each print is small enough to put up anywhere (5"" by 7""), but big enough to be noticeable and give whatever space you choose a dose of personality. They're imbued with affection and humanity through the handmade design and print process, and are printed on thick paper with a deckled (rough) edge. </p>
<p>Apart from that, funding this campaign would give me a fighting chance. Many bootcamp attendees throw down that tuition money as if it's lunch. I am not one of these people. The ability to start from a level playing field with my peers by graduating without debt would be a game-changer. My ultimate goal is to combine my skills as an engineer with my experience as a designer and elevate the visibility of nonprofits like the ones I've worked with in the past. These operations are filled with talented, passionate people, but desperately need a technological facelift to compete with huge corporations for our attention. I have seen how the right tools can make them more effective and visible, and I'm determined to provide those tools. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges (If It's F*cked Up, I'm To Blame)</h3>
<p>Risks for this campaign include: </p>
<ul>
<li>If there's a large response, creating the prints will take more time, delaying the date the prints would arrive to your door.</li>
<li>The cost of shipping could be way higher than I've anticipated</li>
</ul>
<p>I've made quite a few of the prints and I'm confident that this is a feasible project numbers-wise, but if the response is overwhelming, they would take more time to produce and to therefore land in your mailbox. But to be honest, this would be my favorite problem.</p>
<p>I've estimated the cost of shipping each package type and have categorized the brackets accordingly, so this is really only an issue if I've drastically overlooked a certain cost.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Print Anything (Else)</h3>
<p>So you don't like emo song lyrics, eh? Well, I guess we'll agree to disagree. However, I do make other kinds of art, in case you're still interested in buying some art.</p>

</div></div>","We Are From Dust - Supporting Working Artists
The global COVID-19 pandemic has strained all of us, but particularly hard hit are the working artists who don't enjoy the privilege of a financial safety net when the bottom drops out. We Are From Dust is committed to supporting working artists through exhibition of, and fair payment for their work.
Your donation will go directly to We Are From Dust's exhibiting artists whose works are on display at Point San Pablo Harbor in Richmond, CA. Funds raised beyond our goal will also allow us to build capacity to install our next set of five exhibitions — supporting yet more artists — when the world is once again ready to connect around participatory art. Thank you!  


We Are From Dust is made up of Burners and non-Burners dedicated to transforming people’s lives through participatory art. In the spirit of inclusion, collaboration and communal effort, all are welcome to join us in this effort. Together, we have amassed over 130 years working in various capacities for the Burning Man Project, and our experience has benefitted the development of art projects around the world.
WAFD's inaugural exhibition at Point San Pablo Harbor has been a great success, featuring artworks from professional working artists Kate Raudenbush (Future’s Past), Michael Christian (Asterpod), Paige Tashner (Purr Pods), and Peter Hazel (Niloticus).

Rewards and Perks
Here are some of the amazing and unique perks we like to offer in return for your support.

But it also goes deeper than that. Recognizing there's a behind the scenes aspect to everything we do can help keep things in perspective.

My dad was an engineer who taught me how to investigate the infrastructure of things to see how they tick and how to build things to last a lifetime and my mom is an artist who taught me the secrets of oil painting. <i>Bounce Back</i> combines those influences into a joyful, thoughtful and interactive work of art for all to enjoy!

<h3>Is this a real lottery? </h3>
<p>No, sillypants.  It is not a real lottery.  You can't win Inner Peace, a Mansion, a Samurai, or anything else depicted on the ticket.  Your prize is the picture itself -- and the joy of maybe, just maybe, finding the elusive Golden Retriever in a Hat, Veiny Penis, or Wet P*ssy.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<h3>Who is Lyle Bergman? </h3>

<p>It takes a lot of fuel to keep the old airship flying, and sometimes, it's hard to come by,</p>
<p>Inkstained Sucucubus is a small press that (fictitiously) operates off a steampunk pirate airship. On the ground, we are devoted to science fiction and fantasy, often with a queer bent. </p>
<p>Book sales aren't what they were, and even long-respected publishers like Amber Quill and Samhain are shutting their doors. To supplement the travel budget, and put our books in front of more eyes, we expanded into a craft line, Conspiracy Arts for SF conventions, The Carpenter's Wife for Renaissance fairs and SCA. Also, when we are too ill for computer work, we can sit and let our fingers accomplish something.</p>
<p>There's always one problem with any merchant business: storage space.</p>
<p>We're rapidly outgrowing our available space and as we move into selling at outdoor events, we also have that equipment to worry about.</p>
<p>We scored a major break with the sunshade this year, and it was as though Hermes smiled on us and said “Go Thou Forth and Sell All The Things.”</p>
<p>That's why we're running the crowdfunding. We need some seed money. We're not saying “give us money.” We're saying “Here's a chance to get some exclusive stuff,  and send us on our way.”</p>
<p>Our ultimate funding goal is $5000. That's not a lot of start-up capital.</p>
<p><i>What we plan to buy</i>:</p>
<p>1) A year of off-site storage. Gabriel's apartment is far too crowded right now.</p>
<p>2) A band saw. With this, Gabriel can cut custom shaped paddles, no longer limited to this shape:</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><strike>3) A power sander for these projects  </strike>Acquired by way of Ibotta rebates.</p>
<p>4) Wood for these projects. Cloth for hats.</p>
<p>5)<strike> A button press</strike> This has been acquired for nearly nothing, through judicious use of mystery shopping and internet rewards sites, However, we do need a circle cutter, and button parts. The gods help them as help themselves.</p>
<p>6) Display set-ups: A lattice wall, another couple of tables, a hanging rack.</p>
<p>7) A microphone and soundproofing so Gabriel can begin recording audiobooks</p>
<p>8) Space at the following events, as well as others:</p>
<p><strike>Renaissance Fair of the Ozarks, Fayetteville AR </strike><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This has been specifically funded by a donor</span></p>

</div></div>","The Flight of the Inkstained Succubus

It takes a lot of fuel to keep the old airship flying, and sometimes, it's hard to come by,
Inkstained Sucucubus is a small press that (fictitiously) operates off a steampunk pirate airship. On the ground, we are devoted to science fiction and fantasy, often with a queer bent. 
Book sales aren't what they were, and even long-respected publishers like Amber Quill and Samhain are shutting their doors. To supplement the travel budget, and put our books in front of more eyes, we expanded into a craft line, Conspiracy Arts for SF conventions, The Carpenter's Wife for Renaissance fairs and SCA. Also, when we are too ill for computer work, we can sit and let our fingers accomplish something.
There's always one problem with any merchant business: storage space.
We're rapidly outgrowing our available space and as we move into selling at outdoor events, we also have that equipment to worry about.
We scored a major break with the sunshade this year, and it was as though Hermes smiled on us and said “Go Thou Forth and Sell All The Things.”
That's why we're running the crowdfunding. We need some seed money. We're not saying “give us money.” We're saying “Here's a chance to get some exclusive stuff,  and send us on our way.”
Our ultimate funding goal is $5000. That's not a lot of start-up capital.
What we plan to buy:
1) A year of off-site storage. Gabriel's apartment is far too crowded right now.
2) A band saw. With this, Gabriel can cut custom shaped paddles, no longer limited to this shape:



and Angelia can do the fictional street signs



3) A power sander for these projects  Acquired by way of Ibotta rebates.
4) Wood for these projects. Cloth for hats.
5) A button press This has been acquired for nearly nothing, through judicious use of mystery shopping and internet rewards sites, However, we do need a circle cutter, and button parts. The gods help them as help themselves.
6) Display set-ups: A lattice wall, another couple of tables, a hanging rack.
7) A microphone and soundproofing so Gabriel can begin recording audiobooks
8) Space at the following events, as well as others:
Renaissance Fair of the Ozarks, Fayetteville AR This has been specifically funded by a donor
FroliCon, Atlanta GA
Southern Delta Church of Wicca's Beltane, Memphis
River City Comic Expo, Little Rock AR
Hypericon, Nashville TN
Mid-South Renaissance Festival, Memphis TN This has been specifically funded by a donor.
Memphit FurMeet, Memphis TN
Cooper Young Street Festival, Memphis Tn
MidSouth Pride, Memphis TN
ConTraFlow, New Orleans
Festival of Souls, Memphis TN
ConTraception, Independence MO

octobre dernier, la Société québécoise des infrastructures a mis en vente le
studio que s’était bâti Ernest Cormier, un des plus grands architectes québécois
du 20e siècle. Le studio n'est toujours pas
classé au patrimoine et il est à craindre qu'il perde sa vocation d'atelier.




Notre initiative




La Société pour la sauvegarde du studio Ernest Cormier est l’initiative de jeunes artistes, photographes, designers et muséologues qui se sont réunis pour acquérir l’édifice, le préserver et faire reconnaître son statut patrimonial.
Nous voulons perpétuer sa vocation d’atelier, continuer l’activité de son bâtisseur et de tous les artistes qui lui ont succédé. Ce lieu unique de notre architecture moderne doit revivre.
L'objectif de la présente campagne est d'amasser une somme de 28 000$ afin de pouvoir présenter notre offre d'achat le 31 mai prochain.
Phase 1 — Acquisition du studio Phase 2 — Restauration et revitalisation du lieuPhase 3 — Implantation de notre projet





Occupation projetée du studio

Lieu de travail, de rencontres et d'échangesNotre projet vise à terme la création d’une structure autonome: un atelier expérimental pour la recherche, la création, l’éducation et la diffusion.Chaque année sont accueillis des participants issus de différentes disciplines liées aux arts visuels, au design graphique et à la photographie. Tout au long de leur séjour, des intervenants d'ici et d'ailleurs, qu'ils soient architectes, designers, photographes ou philosophes, sont invités à guider les participants dans leur pratique.Les participants sont sélectionnés sur la base d’un projet qu’ils soumettent. Axé sur la culture visuelle et inspiré par la phénoménologie, le programme les amène à reconnecter avec leur vision et à développer une sensibilité à leur milieu de vie et leur contexte social. Ils sont encouragés à collaborer avec des organismes culturels et communautaires environnants dans l'élaboration de projets.Le studio Ernest Cormier dote ses participants d’outils de réflexion critiques, pratiques, et théoriques sur la base d'une perspective culturelle large. La vie y est ponctuée de conférences, de rencontres, de lectures et de séminaires orientés vers la recherche et le travail à la fois autonome et collectif. Il met à la disposition des participants un espace de travail personnel, un laboratoire de développement photographique, une salle de rencontres et d'expositions, une bibliothèque, et différents outils servant aux observations diurnes et nocturnes. La liberté et la convivialité qu’offre la taille réduite du programme, la qualité exceptionnelle du site et l’excellence des intervenants invités sont autant d'atouts propres à attirer les candidats.Revitalisation et diffusionLa Société pour la sauvegarde du Studio Ernest Cormier tient à révéler au public un lieu fondateur de notre patrimoine architectural moderne rendu presque imperceptible pour en faire à nouveau un pôle culturel majeur. C’est à travers sa visibilité, sa revitalisation et la diffusion de ses activités que nous entendons le lier à l’écosystème des institutions communautaires et culturelles qui l’entourent.Revitalisation et restauration des jardinsNous voulons faire de ce lieu un bien commun, un espace convivial accessible à tous. Avec l’aide de l'architecte Gilles Saucier, de la firme Saucier et Perrotte, nous entendons restaurer l’ancien jardin tel que Cormier l’avait aménagé dans les années 1920. À ces côtés, nous projetons la création d’un nouveau jardin au caractère plus contemporain composé d’une végétation variée, d’arbres et d’œuvres d’art.Activités de diffusionLe studio, ses participants et ses partenaires proposeront aux habitants du quartier et au public des activités telles que des projections, des performances, des expositions temporaires et des visites commentées.Le studio Ernest Cormier n’est plus le projet d’un seul homme, il nous appartient à tous de le sauvegarder et de le considérer comme pilier de notre culture, de notre identité et de notre histoire.**

<h3>WHAT'S A BADGE OF AWESOME?</h3>
<p>A Badge of Awesome is a unique gateway into the DIY craft world. Learn how to embroider. Make something you can be proud of. Know that you've helped someone in need.</p>
<p>We're the first company selling DIY embroidery badges. Not only that, but our kits have everything you need (except scissors) to easily make your custom merit badge in 1-3 hours with no prior sewing/embroidery experience. The best part—20% of the profits generated by every purchase go toward helping refugees of climate change. </p>
<p><strong><i>*** We are currently HAND MAKING each of these badge kits and are raising funds to lower the cost of production (which means less expensive badges in the future and more $$ donated. Thanks for your support!) </i></strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476047723/tuu0lmpvo7fihhligs0j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>INCLUDED:</p>

<li>Black embroidery floss</li>
<li>One 3"" embroidery hoop </li>
<li>One embroidery needle</li>
<li>Instruction book </li>
<li>BONUS: Iron-on adhesive backing  </li>
</ul>
<p>All those icons in the middle of the circle (DO THINGS, the heart, the disco ball, the cupcake; 10 in total) are printed in ink on the fabric, so all you have to do is embroider over the ink, cut it out, and iron or stitch it onto anything you like.</p>

<h3>WHY REFUGEES OF CLIMATE CHANGE?</h3>
<p>Because every day there are more and more people being displaced by the direct and indirect effects of climate change.</p>
<p>While future projects may include helping other social and environmental causes, we want to focus 20% of our profits for this campaign on a cause that's closest to our hearts: climate refugees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change causes flooding and draughts that drive malnutrition and sanitation issues, which means that people in high flood or draught-prone zones will be forced to move from their homes <strong>in order to survive</strong>.</li>
<li>The United Nations estimates that 36 million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2009, <i>the most recent year for which statistics are available.</i> Scientists predict this number could rise to at least 200 million by 2050 — meaning that <strong>within 35 years, one in every 45 people in the world could be displaced by climate change.</strong>

<h3>SUPER EASY TO MAKE!!!</h3>
<p>Quick. Crafty. Customizable. Kind. Our badges are for fellow do-gooders that like making things and contributing to worth-while causes.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>OUR FUNDRAISING GOALS</h3>
<p><strong>MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT: We need $5000 USD. Here's where it's going:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've already invested around $2000 USD in prototyping materials, so that we can get the badges out to local shops and to any investors on this Indiegogo campaign</li>
<li>Because 20% of our profits go toward climate refugee relief efforts, we want to reduce our unit costs and increase amount donated: lower production costs on our part means more money to non-profits. So, we need to be able to buy in wholesale</li>
<li>With $5000 USD, we can hit the minimum order quantity to scale our production outside of Portland and contribute more to our cause.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TARGET: We want $7000. Here's why:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We started working on our website but quickly realized that, in order to make the site to the same high quality of our product, we're going to need some help.</li>
<li>With $7000 we can not only purchase materials wholesale, but we'll also be able to start an expert built online shop for Badges of Awesome. This will allow us to side-step selling our badges through retail shops at wholesale prices and put more money towards helping climate change refugees!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEST CASE SCENARIO: We would love $12000. Here's what we'd do with that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking towards the future, we'd like to sell more than our initial 10 Classic badges. Ultimately, we have 10 more themes that we'd like to carry (with 10 badges per theme). As we start selling badges that better suit each individual's personality, they'll keep getting more and more awesome. </li>
<li>With $12000, we'll be able to do everything above AND increase our product line to specific badges for gamers, nerds, kids, and makers. It's where we wanted to start, but had to hold-off because of the complexity involved. </li>
<li>Extra badge options mean: altering our packaging slightly for each line, a more complicated website, and more work on the manufacturing side. Your contributions will help us raise the bar on our product options without raising our stress-level. </li>
</ul>
<h3>OUR FAVORITE PERKS!!!</h3>
<p>We've created a variety of perks at a few tiers for people who want a Badge Kit and for people who just want to help us increase awareness and raise money for our project.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Before we created Badges of Awesome, we worked in design research and strategy and helped companies solve design and business problems. We've got a background in helping create successful businesses, so you can trust that we're going to see this project through. That being said, there are a few small risks to this project. Here's what we see and how we plan to resolve potential issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you don't reach your $5000 goal?<ul><li>We understand that there's a chance that we may not reach our funding goal on Indiegogo but we're ok with that risk. If we can't meet our financial goal and are unable to pursue bulk, wholesale purchases of our materials, we intend to fulfill our Indiegogo orders and will then continue our project in Portland, growing slowly and selling out of brick and mortar shops.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What if you sell too many badges on Indiegogo, and you can't meet orders by December of 2016?<ul><li>Yes, too many orders means slower delivery times. We've already prepped more than 250 badges and are prepared to keep you in the loop, should this campaign become wildly successful.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What if your scaling lowers the quality of your product?<ul><li>Thankfully, our product is made of materials that cost us less when we buy bulk, but do not have to be manufactured any differently. Our scaling will not change the quality of materials that we use.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What if people want a custom badge kit and you can't make it?<ul><li>Part of our plan for the future is to make fully customizable DIY badge kits a reality. In order to guarantee a quality product and timely delivery for this campaign, we have to stick with the images that we currently offer. As we grow, we'd love to give you the ability to make your own icon, choose your own fabric, and make your badge as truly unique as you are.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></div>","WHAT'S A BADGE OF AWESOME?
A Badge of Awesome is a unique gateway into the DIY craft world. Learn how to embroider. Make something you can be proud of. Know that you've helped someone in need.
We're the first company selling DIY embroidery badges. Not only that, but our kits have everything you need (except scissors) to easily make your custom merit badge in 1-3 hours with no prior sewing/embroidery experience. The best part—20% of the profits generated by every purchase go toward helping refugees of climate change. 
*** We are currently HAND MAKING each of these badge kits and are raising funds to lower the cost of production (which means less expensive badges in the future and more $$ donated. Thanks for your support!) 
INCLUDED:

One hand-made 3"" badge of your choice from our line (printed on just plain gorgeous fabric)
Black embroidery floss
One 3"" embroidery hoop 
One embroidery needle
Instruction book 
BONUS: Iron-on adhesive backing  

All those icons in the middle of the circle (DO THINGS, the heart, the disco ball, the cupcake; 10 in total) are printed in ink on the fabric, so all you have to do is embroider over the ink, cut it out, and iron or stitch it onto anything you like.

 
WHY REFUGEES OF CLIMATE CHANGE?
Because every day there are more and more people being displaced by the direct and indirect effects of climate change.
While future projects may include helping other social and environmental causes, we want to focus 20% of our profits for this campaign on a cause that's closest to our hearts: climate refugees.

Climate change causes flooding and draughts that drive malnutrition and sanitation issues, which means that people in high flood or draught-prone zones will be forced to move from their homes in order to survive.
The United Nations estimates that 36 million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Scientists predict this number could rise to at least 200 million by 2050 — meaning that within 35 years, one in every 45 people in the world could be displaced by climate change.


​

According to UNICEF, children will suffer disproportionately from climate change and growing environmental risks, as over half a billion children live in extremely high flood occurrence zones and nearly 160 million live in high or extremely high drought severity zones. 
The current regulations and systems already in place are not even close to ready for the type of mass migration that we'll see over the next 30 years. We want to help, and we want to give you the opportunity to help, too.

We're waiting to decide on the organization(s) to which we'll contribute until after we see how this campaign goes. Here are some of the ones that we're considering:

Ahem.)We cheer the feats of its scholars and alumni, rally with fervor behind its sports teams and heroes, stick emblems and decals on our notebooks, gates and cars. And of course, display their marks on wearables like jackets, pullovers, caps and tees._________________Tee talk.The commonplace tee shirt can be more than just a plain utilitarian piece of clothing. Tees have become a statement, a bold, ubiquitous medium of creative expression accessible to everyone who has a message to send out. And with the available technology in garment printing, the tee can now be a canvas of endless graphic possibilities and legitimate pop art._________________Peyups Pride worn in style.Most school tees are actually mere labels-- school name in text that labels the wearer of their school affiliation. Peyups Pride tees are graphic tees. Graphic tees that are visually rich and evocative. They deliver the message with style and soul. And just like the Peyups spirit—may kabuluhan at astig. _______________Help us make it happen.Giving the idea a big push.Right now PeyupsPride is at its concept stage. Many prototypes have been produced and given out to friends. Our ultimate objective is to launch these as products and make them available in the market. This crowd funding campaign is a crucial stage towards that goal. If we succeed here, PeyupsPride will finally come to be.Giving back to the alma mater.If we raise the target amount of this campaign, Php 100,000 of this will automatically go to UP. This is out of respect for its intellectual property rights. UP holds copyrights to symbols, marks, and all content trademarked to the university. We respect that.I learned about franchising and the licensing fee during my initial discussions with their IP personnel. Frankly, I was not much into the business of this since this started more as a creative venture so I took a pause. I weighed the franchise fee--quite a considerable amount-- and its impact on the viability of project considering that this really started as a hobby.  And for almost a year now, this project had been dormant, held back by that franchising cost. Until it occurred to me that this might not be a stumbling block after all but a road map to the goal. Giving the Peyups community a part in the journey.The heart of this enterprise is the Peyups spirit. And this spirit is best expressed when shared by its very community. So why not involve the UP family to carry this dream project to fruition?I have decided to do so. And here I am at Indiegogo, one of the most successful crowd-funding sites in the web and the only major platform that allows projects from the Philippines. Through this Indiegogo campaign I am reaching out to you, fellow Peyups. By doing so I hope to have a feel of the community. And the pledges of support from you will be a generous affirmation that we all share the vision._________________Not a dole out. It's ""win-win"" for all.This is a crowd-funding campaign so funds will necessarily be involved. But while supporters are asked to send in monetary pledges they won’t be donation nor charity contribution. There's a quid pro quo. It is because you, the pledgers, will be getting something back that is certainly worth every cent you contribute. Everybody wins.UP wins If this campaign succeeds, PeyupsPride will go into full production mode. And UP will be a major beneficiary of the endeavor. For one, the Peyups community will be offered unique, artful, thought-provoking wearables and pride pieces worthy of UP's original and trailblazing spirit. And on top of that, UP will be financially rewarded as 10% of every PeyupsPride sale will be remitted to the university. Big win for the alma mater.Isko winsOne of the very first programs that PeyupsPride will launch once it starts operation is to bring the Iskolar ng Bayan into the enterprise. The PeyupsPride Iskollection,  a special design collection will be opened featuring art creations submitted by current UP students nationwide. Creators of selected designs will receive profit share from sales of products that shall feature their work. May dagdag allowance o pang-tuition si Isko. Panalo._________Perks.There two ways a supporter can contribute-- by clicking BACK IT button above and entering the amount or by availing of the Perks (right sidebar). Perks are ""thank you"" items for specific amount of contributions.The PeyupsPride campaign will accept and appreciate any monetary pledge but offers Perks to amounts of Php 500, Php 750 and Php 1500(equivalent to USD figures in this site since Indiegogo does not use Php currency yet). Pledges of these amounts are rewarded a Perk or a token of appreciation for the support (see Perks section on the right sidebar). Peyups Pride will be producing the Founding Edition RoyalTee and matching Cup 'O Tee from the current full line of designs (gallery found here). Perks will consist of these eye-catching conversation-piece items and guaranteed collector-grade commemorative mementos. Definitely worth as much or maybe more than the pledged amount.Backers may choose multiple Perks.TO SEND REQUEST FOR PERK/s please fill up form here. Submit request for each Perk you availed. Thank you!NOTE: PeyupsPride Perks are tokens for support of the campaign. They can be passed on as gifts but not to be sold.________________The PeyupsPride Art Gallery

To date, I have created more than 30 designs ready for rendering on PeyupsPride RoyalTee and Cup 'O Tee. The collection will definitely grow and I hope to share the new creations with you. And not just on tees but on many more wearable, usable, collectible PeyupsPride mementos. See the current gallery here. _________________The QR code stamp. A special customizable QR code stamp will be printed on the back side of every Founding Edition Royaltee. It will contain the Founding Member tag, name, college, course and batch year of the backer or of the person who'll receive the shirt.

<p>The Westmoreland Museum of American Art and the City of Greensburg have partnered on <i>Bridging the Gap</i>, a
public art project to revitalize the North Main Street bridge that connects The Westmoreland to downtown Greensburg. The Museum sits at the top of a hill reached by this functional but unsightly bridge, creating a desolate barrier between The
Academy Hill neighborhood and downtown Greensburg. </p>
<p>Working with the Pittsburgh Office of Public Art and an Artist Selection Panel comprised of local residents, Museum staff and representatives of the City considered dozens of artists for the commission.  In the end,<span style=""background-color: initial;""> Janet
Zweig was selected to design and create the public art project.  Zweig has been
working in the public art realm for over 18 years.  She has designed public art installations for
the City of Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  Locally, she has successfully collaborated
with LaQuatra Bonci Associates Landscape Architecture to build a memorial in
the lawn of </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Pittsburgh's </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mellon Park.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ms. Zweig’s proposal utilizes both the east and west
sides of the North Main Street bridge to ‘bridge the gap’ between the City and
the Museum by giving residents and visitors a changing and dynamic cultural
experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469821854/Untitled-1_g1cz4u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>She has proposed fabricating a three-dimensional
analog scrolling text that will extend the length of both sides of the bridge,
producing an experience of serialized poetry that will slowly unfold over time.
The Museum will commission writers, poets, and artists from the western
Pennsylvania area to produce poems or essays of a specific length for display on the bridge. As residents and visitors drive or walk across the bridge, they can read an installment of the poem or
text, making it an especially appealing site for repeat visits and inspiring
curiosity of what will come next. The full text with author credits will be
available in the Museum and on <a href=""thewestmoreland.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thewestmoreland.org/bridging-the-gap</a>.</p>

</div><div> <p>Thanks to the NEA's Our Town Grant program, The Community Foundation of Westmoreland County's Revitalizing Westmoreland, and support from the Westmoreland Tourism Grant Program, the design process has been completed.   </p>
<p>Currently, we need to bridge the gap in our funding to complete the fabrication and installation of Ms. Zweig's design.  We hope that you will consider helping us complete the project, which is the greatest benefit of your investment. To thank you for your generosity, we have designed a series of perks that will allow you to take a piece of the project with you!  Please note that there may be slight alterations to the donor perks as we finalize our plans with the commissioned artists. </p>

<p style=""direction: ltr;"">Greensburg is in the midst of a cultural renaissance. In the span of a
few years, there has been a renovation of the historic Palace Theatre, the construction of the new Seton Hill University Performing Arts Center, Seton Hill Visual Arts Center, and the transformation of The Westmoreland Museum of American Art, which recently underwent a major renovation and expansion. As
part of the Museum’s expansion, a new green space was added for the community, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">providing opportunities for the public to gather.

The Westmoreland Museum of American Art and the City of Greensburg have partnered on Bridging the Gap, a
public art project to revitalize the North Main Street bridge that connects The Westmoreland to downtown Greensburg. The Museum sits at the top of a hill reached by this functional but unsightly bridge, creating a desolate barrier between The
Academy Hill neighborhood and downtown Greensburg. 
Working with the Pittsburgh Office of Public Art and an Artist Selection Panel comprised of local residents, Museum staff and representatives of the City considered dozens of artists for the commission.  In the end, Janet
Zweig was selected to design and create the public art project.  Zweig has been
working in the public art realm for over 18 years.  She has designed public art installations for
the City of Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  Locally, she has successfully collaborated
with LaQuatra Bonci Associates Landscape Architecture to build a memorial in
the lawn of Pittsburgh's Mellon Park.  

Ms. Zweig’s proposal utilizes both the east and west
sides of the North Main Street bridge to ‘bridge the gap’ between the City and
the Museum by giving residents and visitors a changing and dynamic cultural
experience.


She has proposed fabricating a three-dimensional
analog scrolling text that will extend the length of both sides of the bridge,
producing an experience of serialized poetry that will slowly unfold over time.
The Museum will commission writers, poets, and artists from the western
Pennsylvania area to produce poems or essays of a specific length for display on the bridge. As residents and visitors drive or walk across the bridge, they can read an installment of the poem or
text, making it an especially appealing site for repeat visits and inspiring
curiosity of what will come next. The full text with author credits will be
available in the Museum and on thewestmoreland.org/bridging-the-gap.

What We Need & What You Get
 Thanks to the NEA's Our Town Grant program, The Community Foundation of Westmoreland County's Revitalizing Westmoreland, and support from the Westmoreland Tourism Grant Program, the design process has been completed.   
Currently, we need to bridge the gap in our funding to complete the fabrication and installation of Ms. Zweig's design.  We hope that you will consider helping us complete the project, which is the greatest benefit of your investment. To thank you for your generosity, we have designed a series of perks that will allow you to take a piece of the project with you!  Please note that there may be slight alterations to the donor perks as we finalize our plans with the commissioned artists. 
If we exceed our $10,000 goal, any additional funds will be used for remaining installation costs and the care and maintenance of the art work. 
    The Impact




 
Greensburg is in the midst of a cultural renaissance. In the span of a
few years, there has been a renovation of the historic Palace Theatre, the construction of the new Seton Hill University Performing Arts Center, Seton Hill Visual Arts Center, and the transformation of The Westmoreland Museum of American Art, which recently underwent a major renovation and expansion. As
part of the Museum’s expansion, a new green space was added for the community, providing opportunities for the public to gather.
Bridging the Gap will serve as an inviting gateway from the Museum into downtown (and vice versa) and will help to invigorate street life,
making Greensburg a more inviting and vibrant place for residents and visitors
alike.
