</p><p>My name is Alex CF and I am the curator of the Merrylin Cryptid collection. This is an extraordinary collection of mythical creatures, preserved specimens of species thought to be no more than myth and legend. </p>

<p><big><i>What is the Merrylin Cryptid Museum?</i></big></p>
<p>Thomas Merrylin left a legacy of untold mysteries in the sealed cellar space of a London Townhouse. Discovered in 2006 when this building was due for demolition, the Merrylin Cryptid Collection is a fascinating and bizarre cavalcade of biological specimens - of species unknown by mainstream science. Not only are the specimens well preserved, but each has its own story to tell - its own biology, anatomy and natural history, many of which were painstakingly analysed and researched by Thomas Merrylin himself, a man born in 1782, and last seen alive in 1942. The enigma of this man and his specimens is somewhat unfathomable..</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487905/files/20140406114939-Screen_shot_2014-04-06_at_19.52.07.png?1396810179"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Above is a piece of concept art for the Museum which will be created in a suitable space in East London, with easy access to public transport.

The darkest corners of Lovecraft and the adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs would find themselves at home at the Merrylin Cryptid Museum. </p>
<p>We will have many special events in the museum, and out of the museum. We will have special tours, visiting the haunts of Thomas Merrylin in London, we will have evening lectures on the collection itself, and of course, the main event, where we will dissect one of the larger specimens before an audience. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/461169/files/20140326052029-Screen_shot_2014-03-26_at_11.42.25.png?1395836429"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>We also wish to establish a link to conservation. All of the species presented in the collection are now believed to be extinct, and therefor we wish to draw attention to the species we share the planet with, those who will become myth and legend within our life times.

absolute power, the evil summons its forces to destroy the race of men, 
elves, hobbits, dwarfs,
separated years ago due to their own greed.

Today they unite for the final fight.
Today is the day, today is going to be
the last battle. Today the destiny of every nation, every life, your life…is at stake.

“Ready to enter the battle?”

The Last Battle-Alliance of blood is the new and latest Ares Mythologic- Draconia project to raise funds for the development and production of our most spectacular The Last Battle-Alliance of blood series of miniatures in 75mm, cast in resin of the highest quality.




 

Inspired by what would only be a fragment of the final battle between races against the armies of darkness, the designs come from the masterful hand of Beni Lobel, designer /
 illustrator for publishers like IDW, Dynamite, Random House, Titan 
Comics or DC comics and characters as GI Joe, Constantine, Batman, JLA and TV series for Warner and BBC as 
Smallville, Arrow, Fringe, Vampire Diaries, True Blood, Torchwood, and 
in films such as After Earth,
The sculptures are modeled in high detail 3D by Laslo Forgach, digital sculptor of great experience working for large international companies, and will be 
printed using the most advanced technology to ensure the perfect quality of 
the original. This project can become a reality if you 
want it to, and the whole team of The Last Battle wants you to be a part of it. We need you to make this project a reality!!These are the Last Battle characters:





ARHNARMO, 
ARHNARMO, son of Lothur Hin,
commander of purple elf armies, and Nhamir, The Queen of the Woods. Born from
the union of a lothuriel and a human, he is the only non-elf who commands one
of the Purple Legions, thanks to his bravery and determination. 



Now, in these times of war
and death, his mission is very clear: to destroy the armies of darkness… but he
needs you in his legion!!


---------

ISHANDRA , Captain
of the Purple Elven Legion. Her legion campaigned tirelessly against the forces
of darkness. Ishandra is the first to jump in the fight on the
battlefield,  making her a great value of all the soldiers.






---------



OURH-HUG, 



Orc army commander wildest, the
Acrothe-yrt.

OURH-HUG, just wants blood. He
does not care who you are. He wants to see his axe stained with the blood of
his enemies, or even some of his soldiers,  who dare to violate their
orders, or simply have not fought well. His followers fear him so much, they'd
rather die in  battle, if necessary, just to avoid punishment.
The bravest soldiers enjoy
privileges, more powerful, more loot, more jugs of wine, more human and elven
slaves.
 OURH-HUG always needs
more soldiers... are you ready?




---------



KURU-U, slave-born
of the armies. KURU-U has hardened in the fierce battles and his greatest wish
is to sleep in the mud tied to his master, Ourh-hu

</p><p><b></b></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My Story</b></p>
<p>In 1982, I had a dream in which I was told that I would be
receiving an inheritance of great value from an unknown ancestor. Within a few
days after that dream, through a series of synchronisic events, including a
friend gifting me a Tarot, I realized that my inheritance was the Tarot. I had
known about the Tarot before this but the magical events that were initiated by
my dream focused my attention on the Tarot as never before and I came to see
the deck as part of my personal spiritual journey. From that day on the Tarot
has become the primary focus of my work as an artist, a scholar, and a
philosopher. </p>
<p>In 1987, while studying an alchemical illustration
representing the Philosopher's Stone, I had a revelation that this image was
symbolically interchangeable with the Tarot's World card. This realization was
like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten door. I sat mesmerized as images poured
out of this new portal in my mind, forming a parade of alchemical illustrations
that were spontaneously paired with Tarot trumps. It became obvious that the
trumps can be alchemical, and that the series of trumps describes the
alchemical Opus. This insight led me
into more research, writing, and drawing and after eight years the result was <i>The Alchemical Tarot. The Alchemical Tarot</i>
was originally published by Harper/Collins in London, in 1995.  That edition is now out of print but it
became world famous and copies have sold for over $2,000. I recovered the
rights to the deck and self-published three new editions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continued to work on new decks and books.  I designed <i>The Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery, The Tarot of the Saints, The Angels
Tarot, The Buddha Tarot,</i> and The Vampire Tarot. I authored <i>The Tarot:
History, Symbolism, and Divination,</i> which the American Library Association
said may be the best book ever written on the subject. I have taught about the
Tarot in Australia, Italy, and throughout the USA; curated a Tarot exhibition
for the LA Craft and Folk Art Museum; lectured regularly on the Tarot at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, appeared in documentaries produced by the BBC and
independent film makers, and cut the ribbon at the opening of the Tarot Museum
in Italy.  I have become recognized as an
expert and a scholar of the Tarot.  But
there is one mystery about the Tarot that I have continually tried to explore.

<p>The
oldest known Tarot, or the oldest ancestor of the Tarot, depending on your
definition, was described in a 1449 letter by Jacopo Antonio Marcello to
Queen Isabelle of Lorraine, in hopes of gaining her favor. Paul Durrieu first
discovered this letter in 1895. Franco Pratesi brought an accurate account of
this letter to the attention of playing card historians in 1989, and in 2003
Ross Caldwell made a new translation, which brought it further attention.</p>
<p>In
the letter, Marcello described two decks that he was acquiring for the queen.
Of the two decks, the older one was created between 1412 and 1425 for Filippo
Maria Visconti (1392-1447), Duke of Milan from 1412 to 1447. This deck had
trumps that consisted of sixteen classical gods, and did not follow the
allegory that we now consider standard for a Tarot. The deck was designed by
artist Michelino da Besozzo, working with a plan created by Marziano da
Tortona, the Duke’s secretary, tutor, and astrologer. This is the oldest known
deck to have trumps and, therefore, by my definition, is the oldest known
Tarot.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461557287/Mercury_Front_Back_afstq4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>According to Caldwell,
the deck consisted of four suits, each with ten pips and a king and queen in
the suit. The suit symbols were four different birds: eagles, phoenixes, turtledoves,
and doves. Marziano, who wrote in great detail about the symbolism of the deck,
specified that each suit was intended to represent a life goal or desire,
grouped in two contrasting pairs. The deck also contained sixteen trumps
composed of classical gods, which was not an unusual subject in Renaissance
art. Besides forming a separate trump suit, four gods were assigned to each
suit, with the gods representing appropriate qualities for each goal: </p>
<p><b>   Eagles,</b>
representing the life goal virtue, were assigned Jove, Apollo, Mercury, </p><p>and Hercules. </p>
<p><b>   Phoenixes</b>,
representing the desire for riches, were assigned Juno, Neptune, Mars, and
Aeolus. </p>
<p><b>   Turtledoves</b>,
representing the goal of chastity, were assigned Pallas, Diana, Vesta, and
Daphne. </p>
<p><b>   Doves</b>,
representing the desire for sensuality, were assigned Venus, Bacchus,   Ceres,
and Cupid.</p>
<p>The question of profundity in a game
was also addressed in Marcello’s letter. The letter recounted the rhetorical
question put to the Duke by the deck's intellectual designer, Marziano, who
asked if it is fitting for a serious and virtuous man such as the Duke to spend
time playing a card game. Marziano answered that it is fitting if the game is
equally serious and virtuous in the philosophy that it presents. He felt that
his game met that standard. </p>
<p>As stated above, Marziano wrote a
great deal about the symbolism of the deck, but less on how the game was
played. There is evidence to suggest that even at this early date, playing
cards were used for divination, and Marziano’s concern with symbolism and his
use of birds, which are connected with ancient augury, suggests that besides a
trick-taking game he may have intended a divinatory use for the deck. </p>
<p>No
cards exist from this deck and the originals were most likely hand painted and
gilded like other Milanese 15<sup>th</sup> century decks created for royalty. I
have redesigned the deck as if it became a standard deck that was later
reproduced in woodcuts and hand colored. My images for the cards are based on
Marziano’s descriptions as translated by Caldwell and on the woodcuts found in
the 15th century <i>Hypnerotomachia
Poliphili,</i> early printed cards, as well as other Renaissance sources. In
the future, Caldwell will author a book to accompany the deck, which will be
sold separately.  The cards measure
four and three quarters inches by two and three quarters inches.  They will come in a tuck box with an
eighteen-page little-white-book, with a color cover. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>The Gods</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461337125/4_Gods_1_dljll5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461334344/4_Gods_2_bprqan.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461334390/4_Gods_3_scbt7a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461337569/4_Gods_4_nqrzlj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b></b><p><b><br/></b></p><b>The Royals</b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461338589/4_Queens_M_mv9uew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461338613/4_Kings_M_sweaks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Some Pips</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461343237/4_Aces_M_gpjkbr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461343265/4_Deuces_M_b7rzls.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461343296/4_Fives_M_bwkayf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Box</b></p><div>

<br/></div>","My Story
In 1982, I had a dream in which I was told that I would be
receiving an inheritance of great value from an unknown ancestor. Within a few
days after that dream, through a series of synchronisic events, including a
friend gifting me a Tarot, I realized that my inheritance was the Tarot. I had
known about the Tarot before this but the magical events that were initiated by
my dream focused my attention on the Tarot as never before and I came to see
the deck as part of my personal spiritual journey. From that day on the Tarot
has become the primary focus of my work as an artist, a scholar, and a
philosopher. 
In 1987, while studying an alchemical illustration
representing the Philosopher's Stone, I had a revelation that this image was
symbolically interchangeable with the Tarot's World card. This realization was
like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten door. I sat mesmerized as images poured
out of this new portal in my mind, forming a parade of alchemical illustrations
that were spontaneously paired with Tarot trumps. It became obvious that the
trumps can be alchemical, and that the series of trumps describes the
alchemical Opus. This insight led me
into more research, writing, and drawing and after eight years the result was The Alchemical Tarot. The Alchemical Tarot
was originally published by Harper/Collins in London, in 1995.  That edition is now out of print but it
became world famous and copies have sold for over $2,000. I recovered the
rights to the deck and self-published three new editions.
Meanwhile, I continued to work on new decks and books.  I designed The Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery, The Tarot of the Saints, The Angels
Tarot, The Buddha Tarot, and The Vampire Tarot. I authored The Tarot:
History, Symbolism, and Divination, which the American Library Association
said may be the best book ever written on the subject. I have taught about the
Tarot in Australia, Italy, and throughout the USA; curated a Tarot exhibition
for the LA Craft and Folk Art Museum; lectured regularly on the Tarot at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, appeared in documentaries produced by the BBC and
independent film makers, and cut the ribbon at the opening of the Tarot Museum
in Italy.  I have become recognized as an
expert and a scholar of the Tarot.  But
there is one mystery about the Tarot that I have continually tried to explore.
I wanted to know what the artists who originally created the Tarot were thinking.

The Marziano Tarot
The
oldest known Tarot, or the oldest ancestor of the Tarot, depending on your
definition, was described in a 1449 letter by Jacopo Antonio Marcello to
Queen Isabelle of Lorraine, in hopes of gaining her favor. Paul Durrieu first
discovered this letter in 1895. Franco Pratesi brought an accurate account of
this letter to the attention of playing card historians in 1989, and in 2003
Ross Caldwell made a new translation, which brought it further attention.
In
the letter, Marcello described two decks that he was acquiring for the queen.
Of the two decks, the older one was created between 1412 and 1425 for Filippo
Maria Visconti (1392-1447), Duke of Milan from 1412 to 1447. This deck had
trumps that consisted of sixteen classical gods, and did not follow the
allegory that we now consider standard for a Tarot. The deck was designed by
artist Michelino da Besozzo, working with a plan created by Marziano da
Tortona, the Duke’s secretary, tutor, and astrologer. This is the oldest known
deck to have trumps and, therefore, by my definition, is the oldest known
Tarot.
According to Caldwell,
the deck consisted of four suits, each with ten pips and a king and queen in
the suit. The suit symbols were four different birds: eagles, phoenixes, turtledoves,
and doves. Marziano, who wrote in great detail about the symbolism of the deck,
specified that each suit was intended to represent a life goal or desire,
grouped in two contrasting pairs. The deck also contained sixteen trumps
composed of classical gods, which was not an unusual subject in Renaissance
art. Besides forming a separate trump suit, four gods were assigned to each
suit, with the gods representing appropriate qualities for each goal: 
   Eagles,
representing the life goal virtue, were assigned Jove, Apollo, Mercury, and Hercules. 
   Phoenixes,
representing the desire for riches, were assigned Juno, Neptune, Mars, and
Aeolus. 
   Turtledoves,
representing the goal of chastity, were assigned Pallas, Diana, Vesta, and
Daphne. 
   Doves,
representing the desire for sensuality, were assigned Venus, Bacchus,   Ceres,
and Cupid.
The question of profundity in a game
was also addressed in Marcello’s letter. The letter recounted the rhetorical
question put to the Duke by the deck's intellectual designer, Marziano, who
asked if it is fitting for a serious and virtuous man such as the Duke to spend

the future, Caldwell will author a book to accompany the deck, which will be
sold separately.  The cards measure
four and three quarters inches by two and three quarters inches.  They will come in a tuck box with an
eighteen-page little-white-book, with a color cover. The GodsThe RoyalsSome PipsThe Box

<p>My last show 'Sextremist' received some nice reviews and press coverage, but during my time in Scotland I also learned that The Edinburgh Fringe is not an even playing field. Like in politics, it seems that the party with the most money wins! Its highly competitive and doesn't at all feel like a meritocracy; as middle class comedians with their bountiful wallets suppling them with armies of PR teams, Flyerers &amp; promoters, or those with family connections seem to have an easier ride.<br/><br/>Not only did I struggle to compete for audience with my limited funds. I came up against hostility, not only from my venue due to loud club music but from other comedians too. I am bipolar, the Edinburgh Fringe is probably one of the most stressful experiences you can put yourself through. However, I love comedy and really want to share my truth and connect with people through this medium.

<p> There's a risk I'll arrive in Edinburgh very tired as I'm working hard being my own producer, publicist and comedy agent. But if I do a few tarot card readings and indian head massages I should be able to relax knowing I've earned enough money to cover my costs in Edinburgh. The challenge I face is getting this campaign out there and  being heard.<br/><br/>This show is so important to me, as the story it tells is so close to my heart. After my psychotic breakdown, I had to fight for everything. I had to fight and 'prove my worth' to the government for my right to the disability benifit 'Personal Independence Payment'. Fight for my housing, fight to keep my support worker here with me, and fight for my sanity!<br/>Knowing I have enough money, affording all the tools I need to support me and get my show seen and voice heard, will prepare me not only financially but mentally for the unfair, middle class battlefield that lies ahead.<br/>Some believe the arts are becoming elitist, grants are harder to come by and people from background's similar to myself are struggling more and more to break into the industry. Its hard enough to find money to live, let alone fund internships and creative projects. Is it coincidental that most successful comedians are middle class white men?</p>

Risks & Challenges
 There's a risk I'll arrive in Edinburgh very tired as I'm working hard being my own producer, publicist and comedy agent. But if I do a few tarot card readings and indian head massages I should be able to relax knowing I've earned enough money to cover my costs in Edinburgh. The challenge I face is getting this campaign out there and  being heard.This show is so important to me, as the story it tells is so close to my heart. After my psychotic breakdown, I had to fight for everything. I had to fight and 'prove my worth' to the government for my right to the disability benifit 'Personal Independence Payment'. Fight for my housing, fight to keep my support worker here with me, and fight for my sanity!Knowing I have enough money, affording all the tools I need to support me and get my show seen and voice heard, will prepare me not only financially but mentally for the unfair, middle class battlefield that lies ahead.Some believe the arts are becoming elitist, grants are harder to come by and people from background's similar to myself are struggling more and more to break into the industry. Its hard enough to find money to live, let alone fund internships and creative projects. Is it coincidental that most successful comedians are middle class white men?

The front facing portion of the machine will be a booth that has a live gypsy ""Zelda"" or ""Zoltar"" style fortune teller. Unfortunately participants will discover that Zoltar is not really prepared to give out fortunes as he is busy living his life. When the curtains open participants will find him eating lunch, on the toilet, getting dressed, etc. You are likely to have him tell you that he is on vacation and have him ask you to tell him his fortune instead. This part of the booth is all about shtick and will be a fun, funny, and unexpected interaction. As a consolation for not getting what you thought you would out of Zoltan he will bid you well on your journey and gift you a blank ""coin"" to insert into the coin press machine.  As you follow your ""coin's"" progress along the machine you stop at several different points of interactivity.

<h3>The Divine Dance of Balance</h3>
<div>There are two natural energies inside each of us, one feminine and one masculine. The masculine energy is characterised by qualities such as logic, focus, commitment, excitement, manifestation and presence. The feminine qualities are expressed as nurturing, acceptance, meandering, receptivity, creativity and restfulness.  If there is an imbalance between them or we don't allow one of them flow naturally, it becomes very difficult to run our lives in a harmonious and successful way, as we need both to take on the challenge of this life in a loving and purposeful manner.  This is the key to solving all other imbalances in the world (violence, poverty, conflict, injustice, ecological devastation, etc).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span>Balancing the feminine and masculine energies within ourselves and around the world has the potential to bring us into a saner and more sustainable way of living. This is what Frances and Adelina embraced when they initiated the project of dancing on all of the node points where the Mary and Michael line meet in Britain.</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div>The Mary and Michael lines are ley lines (earth energy lines), which weave in and out of each other across southern Britain, from Carn Les Boel in Cornwall to St. Margaret's Hopton in Norfolk.  These lay lines link up Sacred sites such as; St Michaels Mount, Glastonbury, Avebury, Royston Cave's among many others. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The book, 'The Sun and the Serpant' by Hamish Miller and Paul Broadhurst was the main inspiration for Frances and Adelina to engage in a dancing and photography pilgrimage from Spring Equinox 2006 to Auntumn Equinox 2007.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In 2012 the book, '<b>The Divine Dance In the Sacred Landscape of Britain</b>' was published by Christine Horner of 'In the garden publishing'. The book was celebrated and launched on 18th May 2013 as part of the Swindon Festival of Literature. The book is mainly photographs and enough words to tell the story in a poetic way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Soon there will be a delightful photography exhibition in Stroud from the 4th to 10th July 2016 and Frances and Adelina are really looking forward to welcoming and sharing their story of the journey with you ....</div>
<div>
<b>Frances Lewis</b> has been teaching Yoga since 2000 and is dedicated to sharing the gifts of Yoga. She is a courageous dancer of truth and wisdom.</div>
<div>
<b>Adelina </b>teaches Tantra internationally, offering both private and group workshops. Her passion is to offer people an opportunity to realise their true nature by bringing awareness to the practice of Tantra and ultimately to all aspects of life.</div>
<blockquote>""Adelina's gift with photography is not only to surprise and delight, but also to include the viewer. She manages to make us feel as if we are there with them participating in the dancing of the Mary and Michael node points and accompanying them on their journey. By capturing the mood of the moment with her careful watchfulness she draws us into their world of balancing the feminine and masculine energies in a deeply personal way.  Adelina and Frances have created a unique exploration of the meeting of the Mary and Michael ley lines. The two have worked as one and it shines through in the joyous celebratory book""......(Boo Beaumont)</blockquote>
<div>and soon the exhibition ~ what a joy .....</div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Exhibition</h3>

</div></div>","The Divine Dance of Balance
There are two natural energies inside each of us, one feminine and one masculine. The masculine energy is characterised by qualities such as logic, focus, commitment, excitement, manifestation and presence. The feminine qualities are expressed as nurturing, acceptance, meandering, receptivity, creativity and restfulness.  If there is an imbalance between them or we don't allow one of them flow naturally, it becomes very difficult to run our lives in a harmonious and successful way, as we need both to take on the challenge of this life in a loving and purposeful manner.  This is the key to solving all other imbalances in the world (violence, poverty, conflict, injustice, ecological devastation, etc).

Balancing the feminine and masculine energies within ourselves and around the world has the potential to bring us into a saner and more sustainable way of living. This is what Frances and Adelina embraced when they initiated the project of dancing on all of the node points where the Mary and Michael line meet in Britain.

The Mary and Michael lines are ley lines (earth energy lines), which weave in and out of each other across southern Britain, from Carn Les Boel in Cornwall to St. Margaret's Hopton in Norfolk.  These lay lines link up Sacred sites such as; St Michaels Mount, Glastonbury, Avebury, Royston Cave's among many others. 

The book, 'The Sun and the Serpant' by Hamish Miller and Paul Broadhurst was the main inspiration for Frances and Adelina to engage in a dancing and photography pilgrimage from Spring Equinox 2006 to Auntumn Equinox 2007.

In 2012 the book, 'The Divine Dance In the Sacred Landscape of Britain' was published by Christine Horner of 'In the garden publishing'. The book was celebrated and launched on 18th May 2013 as part of the Swindon Festival of Literature. The book is mainly photographs and enough words to tell the story in a poetic way.

Soon there will be a delightful photography exhibition in Stroud from the 4th to 10th July 2016 and Frances and Adelina are really looking forward to welcoming and sharing their story of the journey with you ....

Frances Lewis has been teaching Yoga since 2000 and is dedicated to sharing the gifts of Yoga. She is a courageous dancer of truth and wisdom.

Adelina teaches Tantra internationally, offering both private and group workshops. Her passion is to offer people an opportunity to realise their true nature by bringing awareness to the practice of Tantra and ultimately to all aspects of life.
""Adelina's gift with photography is not only to surprise and delight, but also to include the viewer. She manages to make us feel as if we are there with them participating in the dancing of the Mary and Michael node points and accompanying them on their journey. By capturing the mood of the moment with her careful watchfulness she draws us into their world of balancing the feminine and masculine energies in a deeply personal way.  Adelina and Frances have created a unique exploration of the meeting of the Mary and Michael ley lines. The two have worked as one and it shines through in the joyous celebratory book""......(Boo Beaumont)
and soon the exhibition ~ what a joy .....

The Exhibition

Adelina and Frances are creating a beautiful, vibrant photography exhibition in Stroud. It is an exhibition of some of the stunning photography from our book 'The Divine Dance in the Sacred Landscape of Britain'.

<p></p> <p>Hey all! As many of you remember, I did an Indiegogo campaign a year and a half ago to launch myself back into an art career, and it succeeded with flying colors thanks to your love and support. </p>
<p><i>Not to be that girl, but here I am again, using the crowdfunding platform.</i></p>
<p>But this time it's different. I come to you now as a <b>(somewhat) successful artist and entrepreneur.</b> </p>
<p>Because of my last campaign, I've been on the trajectory to a life as a sculptor and designer. Since my last campaign in April 2014, I've been able to do some cool things: I've created two businesses, one as a selling artist under my name, the other, Dear Survivor - a social enterprise that uses the sale of leather goods and jewelry to fight human trafficking in Southern California. Last fall I was commissioned to created a mixed media installation for DenM in Redlands; and this summer I was hired on a creative team in San Francisco to create an album cover for Magik Magik Orchestra (to be released early 2016). This last month I spent touring England, Paris, Munich, and Budapest, visiting the works of art that have inspired me to follow this career path. And now, I'm the resident artist at AlmadiART, a sculpture studio in Hungary, just outside of Budapest. </p>
<p><b>Art as a career has taken me so much farther then I ever imagined it could. And I feel so privileged to get to do this with my life.</b></p>
<p>Don't be deceived, though. I'm still broke. My notebooks are filled with math calculations, figuring out what I need to sell in order to make it the next month. But hey, that's the life of an artist. And I'll happily take that if it means I get to create every day. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign is different from my last. I'm using this more as a platform to sell and manage my work. This is <i>not </i> a ""please fund my life"" campaign.  I think that being a successful artist is 25% artistic skill, 75% the way you market yourself. So hello, my name is Christine Longoria and I'm marketing myself. If I don't hit the goal my life will go on as normal and I'll keep trekking in the way I do. But here's my thought process for doing this: </p>
<p>1) I have a full ceramics studio at my disposal and two months to make whatever I want. How can I use my time here wisely...?</p>
<p>2) I need to buy car when I get back to California. I've never been able to afford one and the struggle is so real....</p>
<p>3) There are many people who've expressed interest in buying my work...</p>
<p>4) Hmmmm, I should make and sell enough things while I'm in Hungary so I can buy myself a car...</p>

There's a burgeoning small business scene there that I want to be a part of. Also, I'm partnered (well, Dear Survivor is partnered) with a non-profit there called GenerateHope, and I will be able to start volunteering as an art teacher. Working with human trafficking victims has been a desire of mine for years, and I'm so excited about the opportunity. So yes, hoping to be settled there by the start of the New Year. </p>

With this project, I want to take that stand and show the importance of art as well as prove that every person posses this power to create. This is important because there is no discipline that nurtures and sparks the cognitive ability to imagine, and unleashes creativity and innovation, more than arts.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In each city I want to convey the importance art can have as a conduit to social issues.

</div></div>","THE MILLENNIAL TRAINS PROJECT (MTP) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that leads crowd-funded transcontinental train journeys for diverse groups of young innovators (and virtual audiences) to explore America's new frontiers.
To get on board, applicants design a project to advance across the communities where our train stops and then race to be among the first 15 applicants on their selected train journey to reach their $5,000 crowdfunding goal. To learn more about the 2016 journeys click here. The applicant's project is described below.

Short Summary
Each person in this world was born with a great power to create. Whether that be in dance, music, drama/theatre, visual arts or even everyday activities that produce something new. To me, this creation is truly art.Many do not realize how much art is prevalent and relevant in everyday life as it is one first things to go with school budget cuts, narrowing an investment within art, innovation and imaginative capacity. With this project, I want to take that stand and show the importance of art as well as prove that every person posses this power to create. This is important because there is no discipline that nurtures and sparks the cognitive ability to imagine, and unleashes creativity and innovation, more than arts.In each city I want to convey the importance art can have as a conduit to social issues. All while documenting, collecting and creating art to showcase that community and culture. I have created task for each city as listed below that create conversation of the issues but also establish the culture.Los Angeles - Humanize the homeless by activating street art and documenting the dreams/art of the homeless either through conversation or having them paint or draw on a canvas and share with surrounding areas.San Francisco - To document the movement of displaced placed people through forced migration within a growing city. (A cause of homelessness)Denver- To create interactive art with the community by combining dance, music and painting in an area that seemingly has been taken away from the community.Milwaukee - To break down cultural barriers and unite one of the nation's top segregated cities through music, art, dance, and sport.Detroit- To collect stories of resilience in on of the nation’s struggling cities through an exploration of the cities culture defining street art.  See website for more info on each city...  What We Need & What You Get 
For this transcontinental trip to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Milwaukee, and Detroit I will be fundraising $5k to travel aboard the train and connect with artist across the US to enhance cultural vitality (the evidence of creating, disseminating, validating, and supporting creativity and arts as a dimension of everyday life) through art. 
Through this journey I plan on documenting, creating and collecting art with different communities as they express their community's culture through art. After the journey, I plan to hold an art exhibit for all of the art/pictures made and collected in each city as well as a printed magazine of the adventure, redefining the necessity of art as well as different cultures within 5 major cities of United States. 
   The Impact Everybody has a dream, passion, and a mission and that put together makes art.  I have found my art and I would love to help others find theirs as well as help fight for the right to have those things. With art being pushed to an elective or unnecessary element of education, there needs to be proof that an investment within art, innovation and imaginative capacity is still necessary within education. Without art, education will be eliminate creativity, only have emphasis on cut and dry subject like math, science, and history (where it's either you're right or you're wrong).  Risks & Challenges 
There have been many attempts to save the arts and many failing. With my project, it is showing the results art can have on a community and why the world still needs it's creators. 
The biggest risk and challenge are missed connections within each city. Although I have created a list of contact, I have also prepared alternate connections to continue to make this project possible.

I go by ""The Lost Cause"" and am a Portland, Oregon based artist and muralist. I have spent years chiseling away at my craft as a painter and decided that after the past few years of networking, connecting and meeting other artists around the world that it's time to make a tour to visit them in their cities and paint new walls with new people. The tour will be from May 15th-June 18th. It's been my dream to become a muralist and I'm finally living it out, but just like musicians need to spread their sound by touring, I also need to spread my artistic vision with an international tour. <br/></p><p>I will be starting my tour off on May 15th in London where I will paint with artists such as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SPZero76Art"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SPZERO76</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Captain-Kris/341823352615618"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Captain Kris</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lazyobit?fref=ts&amp;ref=br_tf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Obit</a> showcasing our work throughout the city.

From New York I will make my way to Chicago to connect and paint with the amazing and very talented <a href=""http://niceonestreetart.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nice One</a> and Lady Lucx. After a week in Chicago it's time to return to the Pacific Northwest and end my trip with a bang by painting and reconnecting with all of my Seattle friends, then I'll head home to Portland on June 18th.<br/></p>During my tour I will be carefully documenting the entire trip through videos and photos, which I will turn into a zine and also make a short video recapping the whole tour.

<p>I'm Rachel (aka Insomnia) and my BFA is in metalsmithing and jewelry. I currently work at TechShop in Austin and will be using many of the tools there to create my project, like the Shopbot. I've helped others with large art projects over the past few years and I've decided it's time to bring my own creation. </p>
<p>I'm building a teapot large enough for someone to sit inside and enjoy a cup of tea with a friend. My design is prodominately made out of wood and covered in a fabric. The wood provides the skeleton and the fabric grants not only an illusion of privacy, but allows for natural light and air to pass through. I'm hoping to light this up at night with pretty color-changing leds too! This design allows for the structure to be used multiple times since it can be broken down to store and reassembled multiple times. </p>
<p>My goal is to take this to Burning Flipside this May and then apply to other local events as well as look into events outside of Texas that might also enjoy my project. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $850. The majority of that goes into lumber and structural integrity. The remainder goes into consumable supplies (tea, sugar, etc), fabric, transportation, teapots and tea cups, hardware, and wood sealant.</p>
<p>I'm almost as excited about making the Perks as I am the teapot. I'm hand making all of the perks I'm giving away.</p>
<p>Everything is tea themed, but you won't feel like a walking advertisement when you wear my pendant or put my embroidered patch on your bag. I'm also making and giving away a handcrafted wooden tea box with an assortment of teas inside at the  $100 donation level. There will even be a couple scaled down models available for those who want a new art piece to showcase in their home.</p>
<p>The penultimate perk is to have the teapot brought to an event of your choice in the Austin, TX area (and maybe beyond) to experience firsthand! Granted there are a few limitations, so you may want to contact me directly to completely hash out the details. I'd hate for you to want it for something like your kid's 8 year old birthday, only to discover it's already booked for something else. If you've got any questions about this perk, please contact me before purchasing it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My favorite aspect of this project is that not only is it meant to be viewed, but it's also interactive. Take a moment away from a busy environment and sit down for a cup of tea. Make your own experience, will your tea party be solumn and reflective, silly and joyous, or wonderous and inspired? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I know budgets are tight, but you can help in more ways than money. You can spread the word. Small amounts add up when enough people come together.</p>

<h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3>
<p>I hope you are as well as I am hopeful that you are well.</p>
<p>I am James (hey), but this camapaign isn't about me - it's about <strong><em>us</em></strong>. That is, the filmmakers without cameras, the painters without brushes, and the actors without films to act in because the filmmakers don't have cameras.</p>
<p>In fact, there's a whole lot of <strong><em>us</em></strong>, and we go by the name <em>Dot The Connective</em>.</p>
<p>This campaign is the collective effort of all DTC members to raise enough money to acquire a shared pool of resources that will include all of the things any of us will ever need to make art (cameras, costumes, microphones, etc.)</p>
<p>By equipping our 30+ members (and growing!) with a readily accessible art-makin' toolbox, contributors are helping to fund not one single project, but as many projects as we can collectively create, and with 30+ members (and growing!), that's a lot of projects.</p>
<p>(For more on the stuff mentioned above, watch the video, which is above the stuff mentioned above).</p>
<h3><strong>Speaking of stuff...</strong></h3>
<p>...our goal is $22,000 worth. To be more specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera &amp; Accessories (Lenses, Tripod, Memory Cards, Camera Bag) - $7,120<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Lights &amp; Accesories (Kit, Bulbs, Gels, Stands) - $3,850<br/><br/>
</li>

</div></div>","Hello!
I hope you are as well as I am hopeful that you are well.
I am James (hey), but this camapaign isn't about me - it's about us. That is, the filmmakers without cameras, the painters without brushes, and the actors without films to act in because the filmmakers don't have cameras.
In fact, there's a whole lot of us, and we go by the name Dot The Connective.
This campaign is the collective effort of all DTC members to raise enough money to acquire a shared pool of resources that will include all of the things any of us will ever need to make art (cameras, costumes, microphones, etc.)
By equipping our 30+ members (and growing!) with a readily accessible art-makin' toolbox, contributors are helping to fund not one single project, but as many projects as we can collectively create, and with 30+ members (and growing!), that's a lot of projects.
(For more on the stuff mentioned above, watch the video, which is above the stuff mentioned above).
Speaking of stuff...
...our goal is $22,000 worth. To be more specific:

Camera & Accessories (Lenses, Tripod, Memory Cards, Camera Bag) - $7,120

Lights & Accesories (Kit, Bulbs, Gels, Stands) - $3,850

Audio Equipment (Boom Mic & Pole, Body Mics, Mixer, Cables) - $3,720

Editing Suite (Computer, Hardrive, Software) - $1,600

Art Dept. (Costume Maintainence, Building Material for Sets/Props) - $1,500

Steady Cam Rig for DSLR Camera - $1,500

Miscellaneous (Cords, Batteries, Adaptors) - $600

Equipment Insurance - $200 


Any ""extra"" funds will be split between Indiegogo (for providing us this wonderful fundraising forum) and the deli nearest our next shoot (for providing us the wonderful gift of coffee).
Speaking of coffee...
...it's delicious. But more importantly, it keeps the artist's stomach full and thus, his mind focused.
Now when I say ""coffee,"" I actually mean...well...coffee, but also any other foods or beverages that may provide sustenance for artists who are on set all day or in the studio for hours at a time.
The reason I'm speaking of ""coffee"" is because while purchasing a camera is a one-time expense, nourishment is an ongoing investment and an absolute necessity.
Therefore, if we are fortunate enough to exceed our current goal, none of the ""extra"" money will actually be ""extra"" (which is why I keep putting the word ""extra"" in quotes). We can use every cent we get.
You: ""But will you? Will you use every cent you get?""
Us: ""Yes. We will."" Allow me to elaborate.
If you are not yet convinced that your contribution will be a seed that will help plant a Hyperion of creativity, consider the following...
...well, before that, note that ""Hyperion"" is the name of one of the largest trees in the world. I googled it. Okay, now consider the following:

Said video isn't the only thing we've begged and borrowed to make. Check out the reel that's featured in said video to see some clips from past productions.

...and imagine how cool the reel of future productions is going to be thanks to you!
Speaking of ""thanks to you""...

<p><b>Autumn greetings! </b>I am a Brooklyn based mixed media collage artist, photographer, and wordsmith seeking unique, evolutionary, and life changing opportunity for which to foster my passion for creating. <b>As an artist, finding safe ground for which to express oneself is necessary in creating a healthy foundation for growth.</b> Yet opportunity to take time away from life’s daily struggles to tend to the garden of self are few and far in between. Despite the odds, I hope that maybe something sparks the flame needed to illuminate this mysterious path. For me, that fire has communicated itself to me through creative expression, and I have made it my heart’s mission to follow what flows out of my hands. And like all of us sometimes these hands need a little help from her friends. </p>
<p>One year ago I was selected for a month long artist-in-residence program in Finland and it began as a catalyst for my manifesting a sustainable reality in which time, space, and materials can flow abundantly a river without care.  With the help of beautiful people like yourself, I was able to raise enough to cover the cost of the trip, both solidifying what became an earth shifting experience and instilling in me a desire to continue my journey creating magic into the unknown. It has now become a goal of mine to complete at least one residency per year.  </p>
<p>Another monumental dream manifested last year with the help of another fundraiser and my <a href=""http://www.behance.net/gallery/portals/3667419"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‘Portals’</a> collage series was <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/118888000/portals-art-book-collage-series"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">published</a> with Brooklyn’s Papercut Press. It is incredible to think that an idea is only an inches away from tangible possibility, and with a solid dose of hard work and motivation, sky’s the limit.  </p>
<p><b>It has been a long held dream of mine to expand on this series of portals and infuse them with the natural landscape creating a visceral experience that transports one to a thought provoking world of heartfelt curiosity and wonder.</b> The installation would be a portal linking each distinctly diverse location in cohesive sensory experience that is multi-layered in emotion, spirit, and experience. Highlighting various aspects of human nature, growth, longing, loss, love, and the universal truths that flow through us a river without name, I hope to inspire, uplift, and expand the consciousness of all who come in contact with the piece.  </p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, now to the exciting/scary part. Working at a bike shop that specializes in Dutch cycles I have grown fascinated with the culture. As I will be out of work for the winter months, I had a vision that instead of being cold and hungry during the off season I would put my time to good use and work on what everyday becomes more powerful a calling, lest we call it a career. If one month dedicated solely to art making could change my life imagine what three would do.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With bikes on the mind, another project I plan to explore during my stay is a film documentary in conjunction with a photoessay regarding the incredible bicycle culture that exists in the Netherlands. Working at bike shop here in New York has opened my eyes to the potential of two wheels as a means for social, environmental, and personal change. It is my goal to connect with various locals in the cycling community both here and abroad, creating a network of communication and awareness surrounding the potential for cycling to be a functional way of life, not just a sport. I would like to interview, film, and photograph those actively exploring this way of life, creating what i believe to be an important dialogue between utopian ideals and tangible goals.</span><br/></p>

<p>Send me good photo and video reference of your face or the face of a loved one and I'll lovingly draw a really exaggerated drawing of it. If you want a slightly less exaggerated and crazy caricature, that is possible too, but you should still expect a really funny and cartoony drawing! This will be a studio-quality sketch that will take me at least an hour or 2 to create. Up to 2 people can be in this marker and colored pencil art stix drawing.</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hi!



I'm Eric Goodwin, a caricature artist who specializes in extremely exaggerated, abstract, funny styles of art. I have a VERY STRONG passion for the art form and have won many caricature awards (without bribery!) at international caricature conventions such as 1st place for Best Exaggerated Style, 1st place for Best Abstract/Design Style, 3rd place for Caricature of the Year and 3rd place in the Likeness challenge. I've made a living as an artist drawing funny cartoons of people's faces throughout the US at Six Flags, Sea World, my own mall stand, at fairs, parties, corporate events and even drew for 5 months in South Korea! Annyounghaseyo!
As an artist, I love what I do, but sometimes it's tough to make a living, and the next 2 months are going to be nearly impossible to survive unless I raise some money! So here are...
MY GOALS:
-to make it to this year's ISCA con!
-to start up a new mall caricature stand in San Diego!
-to finally create my first art book to help me make some much-needed money!

The yearly ISCA con (International Society of Caricature Artists convention) has been my favorite week of the year for the past 5 years. It keeps me inspired and motivated to continue pushing my craft for the following year, lets me see friends and fellow caricaturists I only get to see at conventions and just keeps my soul all-around happy.
I've worked at my own mall caricature stand in New Hampshire for the past few holiday seasons, so I'm ready for a change of pace and want to work at a new location here in San Diego, especially since I've got a sweet apartment with my caricature buddy Nate Kap that I don't want to leave anytime soon. I know how to run my own business, I've agreed on a location with a mall leasing agent, and I'm good to go, except for the money needed to get everything started up.
Lastly, I've been wanting to create my own art book for years, and I've been saving a delicious smorgasbord of live caricatures for just that reason. Over the next month I'll be creating an awesomely unique e-book downloadable as a pdf that will have lots of fun stuff packed into it. 
HERE'S WHAT I NEED:
Convention Costs:
-plane ticket, round trip: $400
-convention registration: $250
-membership fees: $85
-hotel for occasional sleep: $100
-food for energy and fun misc: $150
Total: $985
Mall Stand Start-Up Costs:
-October rent: $375
-renter's insurance: $90
-mat frames: $180
-drawing protectors: $200
-French easel: $100
-bench for storage and seating: $80
-caricature display: $190
Total: $1215
Live Caricatures Art Book Costs:
-none! I've decided to make an e-book available for digital download as a pdf file so that all sales of the book will be profit. A printed book would cost more money than I can probably raise.

Alvaro also enjoys writing, has published art articles in the literary press. His technique is oil on canvas, which used to express the nature, happiness, joy, country life, his main motivation.Abel VargasHe was born on the Island of Ometepe in 1958. He is 1st Place winner at the I Bienal Centroamericana Primitivist Painting ""Asilia Guillen"". Abel Vargas began to paint professionally in the 80's, a period in which his painting is seduced by the touch naive.A naive painting style which incorporates the tender, and melancholy of the early naive Nicaragua itself, and was born on unconsciously in the archipelago of Solentiname.However, the workshops promoted by the poet Ernesto Cardenal in Solentiname Abel Vargas motivate a naive painting that takes you to recreate the atmosphere of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, although the black dark tones prevail.Originally from the island of Ometepe, and motivated by the lush landscapes of his youth, is mid 90's, where Vargas is released a little naive technique, and begin to recreate a magical landscape of green power, ""turned soles"" , to revitalize the strength of the animal and vegetable.Pablo PaisanoA native of Ometepe, Nicaragua, land of lakes and volcanoes. With 35 years of experience in painting style includes primitivism and abstract. From humble character, hardworking and passionate about art, his work highlights the Nicaraguan landscape inspiration, because in the words of Paul Paisano: ""In my paintings shoulder the elements of my homeland, because I enjoy the game of colors when I paint"".William Gonzalez""My passion for environmental issues, inspire me to paint considering the beauty of nature as a gift of God, which we must preserve and conserve""Live with PassionThis video is copyrighted on youtube for a nicaraguan channel so we could not add subtitles in english, sorry for that.What We Need?

<p><b>Why is international shipping so expensive? </b></p>
<p>First off,
we want to acknowledge that the cost of shipping internationally is expensive.
We worked with multiple carriers in search of the best solution to ship these books. Most importantly, we want the book to arrive safe and fast which
is why we are using FedEx.The book weighs 4 pounds which increases the cost by
a huge amount. It's hard to believe but in many cases we will actually be
losing money. Click on your perk and add shipping above.</p>
<p><b>Where do I add my shipping address? </b></p>
<p>You can add
it when you contribute. Don't worry about this anyway - at the end of the
campaign, a survey will be sent to all contributors requesting your shipping
address, email and any other information required to process your order.</p>
<p><b>You said the electronic version is ""protected"". What

<p><b>Why are you called 21 Draw? </b></p>

Get the book hereIf you missed our campaign, you can still preorder a copy of the book from our websiteHURRY, LIMITED time only! Limited number of copies. This book is not available in stores. Click hereWe asked 200 artists
one question.""If we could make a book that would solve all of your art
problems, what would that book be?"" The following problem areas came up repeatedly:
1. Character design            
                     
     
2. Action poses
3. Drawing faces            
                     
         
4. Drawing hands
21 Draw SOLVES all of these problems
We hired over 100 of the most famous artists in the
world to work on this project. We have artists from Disney, Marvel,
Dreamworks, Rockstar games, Capcom, Sony and other giants of the
entertainment and gaming industry. We specifically selected artists who have experience as character designers. About 50% of the images are black and white and 50% are grey scale.
Each artist was asked to pick one
unique character design and draw it in the following poses:An example to clarify: One of our artists picked a ""hero"" character reference. He draws the hero in 2 full body reference poses (front & side), 3 action poses, the hero's face with different expressions and the hero's hands with different gestures. 10 images altogether. Get it? Good.

<h3>What is White Raven Ink?</h3>
<p>White Raven Ink is a small (one-woman) letterpress and print studio located in rural Nova Scotia, Canada. I design and print greeting cards and fine art prints from my own artwork, using letterpress, linocut, and related printmaking techniques. I also do fine bookbinding and a little papermaking.</p>
<p><img alt=""shell die-cut card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/shell-xsec-proto.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I've been working with pop-up structures and other hand-cut paper items for a while now, and have plans to combine cut paper with letterpress for a new line of greeting cards. Hand-cutting would make these cards far too expensive (not to mention time-consuming), but a die-cuting machine that would allow me to cut my own designs would keep costs down and let me create affordable products.</p>
<p><img alt=""papercut art"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/kentaurs-final-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<li>lots of paper, cutting blades, and other consumables</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Die-Cutter</em></strong></p>
<p>I've done a tonne of research and have picked out two models of die-cutter, a cheaper one and a more expensive one. Which I purchase will depend on how much this campaign raises.</p>
<p><em>Option 1: Sizzix eclips</em></p>
<p>This machine comes with the necessary software and performs all of the necessary functions for die-cutting my own designs. It would work well, though it doesn't have a lot of potential for expansion in terms of larger sizes, thicker materials, or scoring/engtraving. On sale, I can get this one for about $300 plus shipping.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sizzix eclips"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/eclips.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Black Cat Cougar</em></p>
<p>This machine is considerably higher priced, but it's also bigger, cuts a wider variety of materials, and does scoring and engraving in addition to basic cutting. Software is included and even though it's still a desktop machine, it's close to industrial quality. This machine would cost between $750 and $1100 plus shipping, depending on what size I get.</p>
<p><img alt=""Black Cat Cougar"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/black-cat-cougar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong><em>Other Equipment</em></strong></p>
<p>If I raise enough to buy a die-cutter, I'll be deleriously happy, but in the unlikely event that I end up exceeding my funding goals by a substantial amount, there are other pieces of equipment I'd love to add to my studio (all things I'm going to need to replace soon, anyway).</p>
<ul>
<li>computer: My poor old laptop is well over six years old, and showing its age. I'd love to replace it with a desktop iMac.</li>
<li>graphics tablet: Anyone who has done much designing on a computer will probably know how much easier a graphics tablet makes things. I currently have a Wacom Graphire 3, which I purchased way back in 2003 (!), and I'd really like to replace it with an Intuos.</li>
<li>software: Though the die-cutters come bundled with die-cuttting software, I prefer to design with Adobe's Creative Suite. I'm currently running CS4, but it would be nice to upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Goodies! By supporting this campaign you get first dibs on the new die-cut greeting cards, letterpress items from White Raven Ink's catalogue, and other cool handmade, hand-printed stuff.</p>
<p><strong><em>Die-Cut Cards</em></strong></p>
<p>Since the aim of this campaign is to buy die-cutting equipment, the main funding incentives are cards from the new line. I'm currently working to have two sets of designs ready for sale by the holidays, but time permitting I may add more.</p>
<p><em>Dragons</em></p>
<p>The first set will be a series of four dragons, one each for earth, air, fire, and water. The prototype in the image (that one's hand-cut) is fire.</p>
<p><img alt=""dragon die-cut card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/red-dragon-proto.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Holiday</em></p>
<p>I'm also working on some more complicated, multi-layer pop up cards with a winter theme. The one in the picture is one I hand-cut for my mother last year, but it will give you an idea of where I'm headed. There will be four different designs.</p>
<p><img alt=""holiday die-cut card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/holiday-proto-01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><em>Handbound ""Book"" Cards</em></strong></p>
<p>These are the same pop-up card designs, but hand-bound in hard covers. They look like a book from the outside, and when opened, the heavier covers stay open flat on a table, so you can use the cards as decorations. The example in the image is the one I made for my mother last year. These make for a more substantial gift than just a card, and can be enjoyed just like a pop-up book.</p>
<p><img alt=""book card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/holiday-proto-02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><em>Sculpture</em></strong></p>
<p>Every dragon sculpture will be a little different, since even if they're die-cut, they'll still be hand assembled. My plan is to offer these both as fully-assembled art pieces, and as pre-cut kits you assemble yourself. Although the sample image is in white, I'll probably make them in colours, too. Eventually, there will probably be a letterpress-printed version, but for now they're just cut.</p>

<p><strong><em>Letterpress Goodies</em></strong></p>
<p>If you choose the highest level of support, you'll get a pile of letterpress cards and other goodies in addition to the die-cut stuff. The pictures below show a sampling of what you might get, though I haven't decided on what exactly will be included yet. More than likely, you'll get way more than $500 worth of stuff, because I love giving people stuff.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stretch Goals and More Cool Stuff</em></strong></p>
<p>As the campaign goes on if it looks like we'll meet or exceed the funding goal, I'll be adding more items to the rewards. I don't know what they'll be yet, but I'm thinking about bookmarks (both die-cut and letterpress), stickers, fridge magnets... Maybe even letterpress-printed t-shirts. You're welcome to make suggestions if you have a great idea.</p>
<p><img alt=""letterpress prints"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i884.photobucket.com/albums/ac46/nikosilvester/samplecards02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>PHA supports performance artist Pamela Crawford's Project Express Yourself via our Visiting Artist Program.  Her goal for her two weeks in Haiti with PHA partner organizations is to bring self and group expression to the children of Haiti through the art of Hooping.  Pamela will teach hooping skills that will culminate in a community performance at the end of her residency in Haiti.  This performance and the days leading up to it will be filmed for documentation.</p>
<p>This form of dance and exercise carries many physical, mental and emotional benefits.  In dance as a whole, children find ways to use movement for exploration, and to communicate ideas, issues, and their own feelings and thoughts. Adding a hoop to the foundation of dance not only has a fun and memorable impact on their childhood but throughout their life. </p>
<h3>the impact...</h3>
<p>Sometimes children can become so bogged down with the worries of daily life that they forget to let a little of their own creativity come out as they develop into adults. By nature, we are individuals who are yearning to express ourselves to the world.  Fulfilling the natural desire to express who we and share that expression with others is one of the best ways to find peace of mind. The children of Haiti will explore the world of hoop dance to help inspire self esteem, self expression, self respect and provide stress relief. </p>

Project HOPE Art and Pamela Crawford believe deeply in our mission and will make this project a reality with your help.  PHA has made 6 trips to Haiti since its inception in 2010. We are now proud to bring visiting artists to Haiti so they can share their skills and talents.  Pamela is based in Los Angeles, CA where she has taught hoop enthusiasts and children the beauty of hoop dance for the past five years.  She also trains hoopers and fitness experts to become certified hoop teachers as the Teacher Training Coordinator and Master Trainer for Hoopnotica. </p>
<p>The $4250 raised in this campaign will be used to cover the main expenses of executing this project such as transportation, lodging, equipment and filming costs. All PHA team members and Pamela Crawford are volunteering their time, energy and personal expenses into this project.  Any funds we may raise above the $4,250 will go towards the greater PHA mission and its Haitian project partners by bringing supplies and materials to those who need it most.  PHA is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas which makes all of your donations tax deductible.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a collective formed through academia. 15 artists and writers from 10 different countries coming together to reveal our final projects. Not one project is the same; the interests, influences and subject areas are as diverse as our backgrounds. We are rich in ideas, enthusiasm and passion for art and visual expression. Help us realise our vision and make the exhibition as memorable as the work it contains. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>This year, all funding from the University was cancelled to the MA courses. As a result, our exhibition is entirely self funded. We have each donated to the exhibition individually but anything extra would really help us go the extra mile and make something we are all proud to be a part of. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Just  snippet of what your contribution would go towards:</p>
<p>A banner - we really need a banner at the entrance to the gallery and this is an expense of £300 </p>
<p>The catalogue and invitations - we are fortunate enough to have a fantastic designer in our collective who has created an innovative catalogue... but production and printing costs equate to £1000</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>We are all emerging artists passionate and committed about getting our work out in to the world. Unfortunately, this comes with a price tag. Making work in itself comes at a great expense. We have all contributed to the exhibition costs but any and every donation will make a difference to us. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Follow us on social media to see the build up to the show! We are sharing our work in progress, the hurdles,  the breakthroughs and the inspirations. Remember to share with your friends! </p>

A banner - we really need a banner at the entrance to the gallery and this is an expense of £300 
The catalogue and invitations - we are fortunate enough to have a fantastic designer in our collective who has created an innovative catalogue... but production and printing costs equate to £1000

The Challenge
We are all emerging artists passionate and committed about getting our work out in to the world. Unfortunately, this comes with a price tag. Making work in itself comes at a great expense. We have all contributed to the exhibition costs but any and every donation will make a difference to us. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Follow us on social media to see the build up to the show! We are sharing our work in progress, the hurdles,  the breakthroughs and the inspirations. Remember to share with your friends! 
The exhibition will be at Ambika P3, opposite Baker Street station from 1st - 6th September.

<h3>7 years of providing exciting programming and inclusive, safe space for leading regional art practices with residencies, podcasts, exhibitions and more..</h3>
<p>As one of the only independent art spaces in Jamaica NLS has been a site for access to new cultural production, interrogation of social norms, and thought leadership locally and internationally. The organisation supports challenging and experimental art practices, providing artists of diverse backgrounds and identities with safe space, both intellectually and physically, to develop culturally interrogative work. For 7 years NLS has continued to create audiences for art through a podcast programme, open studios, artists’ notebooks and lectures, residencies, experimental exhibitions, and internships that provide avenues for public discourse and the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing the Caribbean as a hub of leading art practices...</strong></p>
<p>With the support we give to diverse art practices NLS recognises the Caribbean as a hub of leading thought and praxis. This has been increasingly validated in the past 5 years not only with visual artists in the Caribbean and its diaspora being the subject of major museum exhibitions and major international awards, but also with the international partnerships NLS has secured. Most recently NLS has been awarded a three-year grant from the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development Next Generation partnership in support of our critical programming. </p>
<p>In a context where the majority of art school students have dropped out or pursued different careers for lack of financial options, NLS has helped create a career pipeline and access to resources with the growing international and local support we receive.</p>
<p><strong>Be an active member of our art community. Invest in the work. </strong></p>
<p>Your support is helping NLS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase our physical capacity to provide larger multimedia exhibition space and live/work space for two resident artists simultaneously, facilitating greater exchange, community-building and a secure environment for artists working on challenging projects.</li>
<li>Increase the stipend support we invest in artists</li>
<li>Acquire shared equipment for residents, staff, volunteers and interns in training: a computer, printer, camera and library. </li>
</ul> <p><strong>With your help we reach our minimum goal of $15,000.</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign benefits artists directly through the building of the project space and stipend support. </p>
<p>We say thank you with limited edition perks from tote bags to art prints designed by accomplished artists who have passed through our programs.  </p> <p><strong>Any amount helps. It's as simple as sharing.</strong></p>
<p>You can contribute as little as $1 USD (about $130 in Jamaican Dollars). If you can’t contribute today, there are other ways you can help us reach our goal </p>

<h3>Here's whats happening:</h3>
<p>My name is Katelyn Bladel, I am recent fine arts graduate, and I am heading out to Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota on July 21st through the 28th.  I will be helping out at the Boys and Girls club in  Mission, SD where my friend Glen Marshall is the director.  I have put together some fun art lessons for each day and am looking forward to having a wonderful week creating art with them!</p>
<p>The first time I ever went to the reservation was on a mission trip when I was 13 years old.  We would go out there for a week and hold a Vacation Bible School for the kids, my church went to a town called St. Francis, about 30 minutes away from Mission.  Our week was filled with piggyback rides, crafts, water balloon fights, and laughter.  I instantly fell in love with kids and their families and always wished I could stay longer than a week in the summer, and a few days each winter break.  I have kept in contact with many of ""my"" kids and now that they are old enough they are on facebook (the joys of technology!) and we chat often.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt=""This is Nadine, one of my girls who is now on facebook, such an awesome thing to be able to stay in contact with them!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/907358/pictures/full/20130702221856-273_1022402201742_5681_n.jpg?1372828741"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>For the last couple years it has been hard for me to make it out there for more than a couple days (art kids are poor and they need to work, all the time) but now I am making the plunge, first a week this summer, and who knows how long next time!</p>

<p>After kid's club I will either be in St. Francis hanging out the kids or out exploring some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen.  My love for the rez has already made it's way into a print or too, and I am excited to have some new images to keep on creating!  When I get back I will be living in the printmaking studio, making prints from the photos I took.</p>

<p>Any contributions to my week on the reservation would mean so much to me.  The kids on the reservation get great art classes during the school year but it is always fun to have a summer program with activities where you can have fun and learn!</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">About 200 dollars goes right to gas to get there and back from Moorhead, plus some extra to go out to St. Francis, and just general adventuring picture taking time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Another 225 dollars goes to supplies for 10-30 kid's art projects for 5 days.  This is the most important amount of money, and the minimum I hope to raise in this quick campaign.  I want to make sure that none of the money for the art supplies comes out of the local Boys and Girls club funding, and I hope to have some extras to leave there with them.  They have a whole art wall that needs to be filled!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The extra 125 is set aside for wiggle room with gas and supplies, fees, and also for postage and packaging to get your sweet perks to you!</span></p>
<p>Speaking of seeet perks!  I will be making and printing a variety of fine art photographs and printmaking prints as a thank you and for your viewing pleasure.  You get to help fund what is sure to be a great week for the kids on the reservation and you get some art in return!  Everyone wins!</p>
<p>And just so you know... The first priority for me is paying for these art supplies, so if I don't receive my full funding it is guaranteed that at least 225 will go to the fun art stuff I need for the kids!</p>

We are a group of therapists interested in making art more accessible to everyone, especially those who may not see themselves as artists. We understand the inherent healing possibility that happens in the process of creating art, particularly in community with others, and so we designed our space with that deep healing potential in mind.  We believe that creating something is good for the soul’s well being, just as physical exercise is good for the body.  Art making brings us back to our senses.

</div></div>","Who We Are






Boulder Art Therapy Collective (BATC) was established in November 2014 with the mission to create community through art. We are a group of therapists interested in making art more accessible to everyone, especially those who may not see themselves as artists. We understand the inherent healing possibility that happens in the process of creating art, particularly in community with others, and so we designed our space with that deep healing potential in mind.  We believe that creating something is good for the soul’s well being, just as physical exercise is good for the body.  Art making brings us back to our senses. It makes us feel connected to our deeper longings. It heals us. Making art in community creates the opportunity for people to share in ways that automatically and deeply builds connection.  



Our organization is open for individual, family, couples, and child therapy with additional hours in the week devoted to our Open Door art making sessions, trainings, and workshops. Our Open Door Studios is a welcoming place for individuals to connect with others while engaging in the creative process.
 What is Art Therapy?

Anyone can use art therapy to explore and manage emotional states. Art therapy encourages utilizing art and the creative process as a way toward self expression, communication, and psychological and spiritual healing. It works toward reconciling emotional conflicts, fostering self-awareness, developing social skills, managing behavior, solving problems, reducing anxiety, aiding reality orientation, increasing self-esteem, and integrating difficult emotional content and trauma. In particular, the creative process helps children who may not yet have the language capacity to express their experiences. 


What We Need

We have poured our heart and soul into creating a relaxing space for those in need of healing.  Our mission has always included inclusivity and we cannot fully express how important it is that art is accessible to everyone in the community. Part of our mission is to reach out to underserved community members and towards this goal we have created a scholarship fund so that low income community members may have access to our programs, primarily our Open Doors Studios and individual therapy. Some of the populations we aim to serve are:




children  with a history of abuse and neglect


families with domestic violence history


cancer survivors


homeless population


children and adults who struggle with depression and anxiety


By backing our project, you will impact the life of an individual or family by providing them the opportunity to transform their lives in a positive way.

Работих с академични текстове и проучвания, но останах леко разочарована от факта, че нашата митология толкова рядко присъства в съвремената арт сцена. С тази илюстрована книжка искам да предложа на своите читатели един алтернативен начин да се запознаят с някои от любимите си герои, а може би дори и да научат нещо ново за тях. А тези, които не познават нашата митология, да се запознаят с частица от българската култура. Дългите академични текстове рядко привличат нови читатели, затова реших да споделя своя поглед за някои от фолклорните герои чрез илюстрация.

Може би сте виждали нейни творби в социалните мрежи като Фейсбук, Инстаграм и Behance.Детелина Шишкова е български журналист и рисърчър. Тя винаги носи книга със себе си, за да задоволява страстта си към литературата. Когато не чете или не твори, Детелина обича да гледа филми и да се занимава с готварство.Risks and challenges.My biggest challenge would be managing deadlines as I am a fulltime MA student and a fulltime employee, but I am really passionate about this project and I believe I can manage to get everything done in a reasonable time frame. The biggest chunk of the work is already done - the production of the book itself. All I have left at this stage is to polish the text and retouch a few of the illustrations I am not one hundred percent happy with.РисковеНай- голямото предизвикателство би било опазването на всички зададени срокове, тъй като съм студент и служител на пълно работно време. Но пък за сметка на това съм изключително мотивирана от този проект и вярвам, че ще успея да се справя на време с всичко. Най- голямата част от работата вече е свършена- изработването на самата книжка и илюстрации. Всичко, което ми остава до момента е доизпипване на текста и на някои от илюстрацийките.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you share the same burning passion, you'll understand.  I've been lucky enough to meet amazingly supportive people along the way. Read what they have to say about me here: Praise

<h3>ME!<br/>
</h3>
<p>As far as taking it to the next level with my circus career, Montreal is where it's at ! I plan to continue working with the coach I trained with over the summer to solidify the act I already have and add those last minute tricks in. If you already know me, you know that the circus is my LIFE! And if you don't know me...well...the circus is my LIFE! I want to be self employed as a performer in the next year and if I can get to Montreal to train for a few months at a time, then that has a REAL shot at reality. How cool! <br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>YOU!</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to fly through the air with the greatest of ease? Have you ever dreamed of running away to join the circus? I'm making those dreams my reality and YOU can help me see them through. Think about it: a $2.00 donation will get me a daily metro pass to the studio to train, $20.00 for some groceries, $50.00 for a lesson, $100.00 for rent- use your imagination. EVERY donation counts!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>US!<br/>
</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $1,000.00 before January 1, 2012. This goal would cover five one hour classes a week, food, metro pass, and rent for the time I plan on spending in Montreal. If I reach this goal, I will be able to keep my focus on training and not on finances (which, as we all know, can be distracting and stressful). If I do not reach my goal, I will need to pick up extra hours at work to save, cutting into my training time. <br/></p>

<p>Tell your friends! You can live vicariously through my circus adventures by donating today! I'll be constantly updating my social network accounts with pictures, videos, and stories so you'll really feel like you're there with me. Oh and first show I'm in, you'll be guaranteed a ticket (maybe even in the front row)! <br/></p>

It’s a big but doable goal – to raise the $650,000 required to build Fraser’s first barrier-free playground at McKinley Park. Unlike other parks, a barrier-free playground’s universal design allows everyone to easily access the play equipment, structures, approaches and pathways. Once completed, this innovative and inclusive play environment will be available to all children. It will be specifically designed to meet the needs of the county’s twenty five thousand children with sensory, developmental and physical challenges. Inviting play, encouraging friendships and showing all children that their individual uniqueness rests in their talents. <br/><p></p>
</div><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Art in the Garden - Doorways to Play</h3><p>In 2011 Fraser First Booster Club found a creative way to involve students with the fundraising for the Barrier Free Playground. Art in the Garden auctions art from community students to fund raise to benefit the goal of Barrier Free play in our community. Past Art in the Garden events featured clay tiles and decorated chairs. </p><p>This year we are featuring ""Doorways to Play"", in which artists will create works created from doors.

</div></div>","Fraser First Booster ClubFraser First Booster Club is active in funding to build a premier barrier‐free playground in Macomb County to be located in Fraser’s McKinley Park. It’s a big but doable goal – to raise the $650,000 required to build Fraser’s first barrier-free playground at McKinley Park. Unlike other parks, a barrier-free playground’s universal design allows everyone to easily access the play equipment, structures, approaches and pathways. Once completed, this innovative and inclusive play environment will be available to all children. It will be specifically designed to meet the needs of the county’s twenty five thousand children with sensory, developmental and physical challenges. Inviting play, encouraging friendships and showing all children that their individual uniqueness rests in their talents. 
Art in the Garden - Doorways to PlayIn 2011 Fraser First Booster Club found a creative way to involve students with the fundraising for the Barrier Free Playground. Art in the Garden auctions art from community students to fund raise to benefit the goal of Barrier Free play in our community. Past Art in the Garden events featured clay tiles and decorated chairs. This year we are featuring ""Doorways to Play"", in which artists will create works created from doors. These artists come from Fraser schools and local charter schools. These artists are eager to help but are in need of supplies needed to create their masterpieces. How you can helpYour donation will give a student artist the materials needed to create their ""Doorway to Play"", and allow them to share their talents to better their community.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are interested in assisting further with this great cause, consider joining the Fraser First Booster Club or volunteering your time.

<h3><b><u>Who/What is the Indigo Artist

<p>Indigo Artist
Collective (IAC), formerly known as Indigo Hippie CO (IHC) is a Brooklyn based collective of creative entrepreneurs and artist who together have over two years of experience
in music,visual arts,art curating, event productions, and youth development. In the last 5-10 years we have seen a rise in childhood obesity in the Bed- Stuy community. The mission of the Indigo Artist Collective Spring Bike Tune-Up is to enrich the lives of local inner city children,families,and communities through artistic expression,community building events,cultural awareness,and promotion of physical activity and healthy living through biking.</p>
<p>Launched in February 2011, Indigo Artist Collective’s first event was based on their initial love and passion for the Arts. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The members of Indigo Artist Collective, recognizing the need to enhance the current art landscape in the service area of the BedfordStuyvesant community of Brooklyn, decided to embark on a series of </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Brooklyn Back Yard Neighborhood Concerts</i></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. These concerts were not only designed to give local artists the opportunity to express themselves through the arts. Also a way to showcase their talent. IAC fostered a sense of community,
belonging and culture among the residents of Brooklyn. Artist, Individuals, families and children were successfully recruited to come out of their homes,and into their backyards to enjoy the sounds of the local artist and bands that were playing at one central back yard of Halsey Street. These backyards became“connected” like 1 big family and could be seen as such by the naked eye of spectators.</span></p>
<p>As the organization grew and the demand to keep
bringing arts to the communities increased,the IndigoArtist Collective embarked on their next initiative, which was driven in part by the feedback and input from the families and residents of those who participated
in the <b><i>2011Brooklyn
Backyard Concert Series. </i></b>Launched in January of 2012,the Indigo Collective’s <b><i>BedStuy BrunchClub </i></b>became one of the premiere artistic social,cultural and networking events in the area. During the <b><i>BedStuy Brunch Clubs</i></b>, the“Crème de la crème”of the Brooklyn creative
community would come together to fellowship,eat and network on the engrossing topic of artistic expression, community building and cultural enrichment. A selection of topics serve as an aperitifs to various brunch menus prepared by esteemed independent culinary artists like Zap Williams, Lorenza Collins and Omena El.The energetic and smooth sound of a live band tops
off the meal during the run of <b><i>BedStuy Brunch Club </i></b>series.These brought up the topics Health Eating , Active Living and Child Obesity. IAC wanted to stand up in the frontline for the  fight against childhood obesity. By having bicycles donated to Kids in need being our way of contributing our efforts this war. </p>
<h1><b><u>Spring Bike Tune Up (SBTU) Event
Narrative</u></b></h1>
<p></p><p>May is<span> National Bike Month—The ideal time to ride. Riding a bike can be a great way to enjoy mild
temperatures while remaining active. Bed-Stuy is one of many poverty stricken
neighborhoods in the nation that suffers from high risk of childhood
obesity.  Bicycling has all sorts of
health benefits—engaging your legs while being easy on the joints, and
providing a sense of freedom and enjoyment for youth.  </span></p>
<p>For the past two years IAC has produced the Annual Spring
Bike Tune-Up based strategically in Bedford-Stuyvesant to help the fight against Childhood Obesity by supplying
new and used bicycles to youth, ages 5-13. To date, we have
donated over 75 bicycles and this year we are hopeful to exceed that number.  The Annual Spring Bike Tune Up will take place at Fulton Park.  The park will be filled with activities to draw in and entertain the whole family.  This grassroots event will be enriched by local culinary artisans, live bands performances, an art showcase and a live
BMX bike exhibition. On-lookers can also have fun getting a free face painting, taking chances at winning one of the raffle prizes, gain cycling knowledge though bike maintenance and safety clinics,  while not forgetting to take home a complimentary bike light or bell. Trained mechanics will be on site doing free bike tune-ups. <span style="""">IAC wants to give families who may not be able to afford bikes for their children, an opportunity to enjoy cycling alongside teaching healthy living and art appreciation. </span></p>
<p>SBTU will also be a platform to educate and attract youth to
participate in the Indigo Performing Arts Center, coming soon. This center will
be a haven for youth enrichment through after-school art and music programs.</p><br/><p></p>

<p>Hey guys, Kahoko here. Some of you may be wondering, what is this? Why am I here? And what is this all about? Well, that's what I'm about to <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">explain. I created this page because I am trying to fund a project to get myself started in the art world. No, I don't do fine art or big fancy </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">paintings. I draw chibis, and I make plush pillows. But before I get into all of that, I'd like to give you guys a bit of background on what </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">exactly inspires me to do what I do and why I chose to do this instead of say, a normal job. </span></p>
<p>I created this project, Giri Giri Petshop, when I was dating someone I really cared about. I gave him a nickname, as silly as it was; and it was <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">'panda'. After a conversation one night he convinced me to make myself a panda plush, so I could feel like he was always with me. When it was </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">completed, it kind of looked like one of those smashed, badly shaped onigiri balls that girls who don't know how to cook make and give to their </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">boyfriends in anime. But it was cute! From that moment on, I felt that I loved this shape, for plushies, chibis, all sorts of things. So I </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">continued working in this style, keeping the thought in mind that it started out of love and will always be reminiscent of those bad cooks who </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">love their boyfriends dearly.</span></p>
<p>On another note, I've always had a rough time working with people on things that were assigned to me. Not because I don't want to do them, but because <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">it's just hard for me to do things that don't interest me much. I have anxiety and I'm in the process of being evaluated and treated for </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">other things, like Borderline Personality Disorder. These things make it difficult for me to interact with other people in a normal way, so for </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">me to make a living without dealing with all of the stress and pressure that slowly breaks down my mental state until I'm incapable of giving </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">any more to something that I just didn't want to do anymore... I decided that I need to do something that makes me happy, that I enjoy, that I WANT to do. And I love anime, I love </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">drawing, I love making things.. but I need your help.</span></p>
<p>Because of me being unable to work a normal job, I don't have the funds to start this project. I need money to pay for my travel, my hotel, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">convention and table fees, and for my inventory. Sure, some of the stuff I can handle and make at home, but I'd really like to expand my inventory </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to things like buttons, and stickers, and phone charms. Everyone likes phone charms, right? And who doesn't love buttons with cute little chibi </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">characters on them? That's where you come in, even the smallest donation will help me get a push in the right direction. Even if I don't make my </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">goal, the money collected will be used to print and create everything that I can. And of course, each and every one of you will receive something </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">in return for your help. </span></p>
<p>All designs that you can choose from for your perks can be found at the following address. I will be adding more as I create them, so keep an eye out! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GiriGiriPets?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/GiriGiriPets?fref=ts</a></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Firstly, Who Am I?</span></h3>
<p>I'm best known on the internet as CryoGanix. I am a 19-year-old novice stained glass artisan, currently in training under a master artisan with over 45 years of experience in making stained glass pieces. I've been making glass projects for just under a year now, and have only gotten better with each piece that I've made.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Makes My Work Unique?</h3>
<p>All stained glass artisans—young and old—are taught that a margin of error is acceptable, especially when it comes to small gaps in the glass that can be hidden by lead or filled in with solder. They are taught that most mistakes can be made into opportunities or that the mistakes can be completely hidden by the joining medium.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center; display: block;""><img alt=""Abstract Suncatcher"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/PRJs0Qn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That is only somewhat true with my work. Instead, I work to make sure each and every individual piece of glass lines up perfectly with the surrounding pieces, forming the tightest and most perfect fit. The only margin of error I will ever accept while making a project (especially for a client, friend, or family member) is cutting away some glass from a piece that is too big. If the glass piece is any smaller than what it needs to be and it forms any type of gap in the pieces, I will put the least complicated piece aside to be used as scrap glass and will re-make that piece.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center; display: block;""><img alt=""Simple Suncatchers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/CFLuYfx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I believe that everyone should get what they pay for, and they're paying for quality and beauty. I will not stand for anything less than the absolute best that I can do; the quality of my projects are what defines my skill, and that includes how much work and care I put into each and every small piece of glass.</p>
<p>This kind—my kind—of dedication is an extreme rarity these days, especially among the dying art of stained glass.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Do I Have Planned Next?</h3>
<p>As you can see in the image above, I am planning on making a stained glass window (not a suncatcher or hanging piece, but an actual <strong>window</strong>) of the character Discord from the television show <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. The project is planned to be 3ft wide by 5ft tall (36"" x 60"").</p>
<p>It will not have any hanging rings attached to it and it is not intended to be hung. This piece is meant to be a permanent addition to your house, whether that's being physically installed in a wall or being the centerpiece of your room of choice (such as on top of a fireplace mantle).</p>
<p>At first, this piece will not be for sale. It will follow me to every convention I go to and serve as a testament that all of you helped make this artisan's dream a reality: to make the stained glass projects that will entertain, amaze, and inspire viewers for years, even decades or centuries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's Stopping Me?</h3>
<p>For the first 15-16 years of my life, because of my severe ADD, I neglected my physical health and instead focused on what made me happy or what gave me instant satisfaction, such as playing a video game instead of taking a shower or brushing my teeth. As you can imagine, that is a very serious issue, which has unfortunately caught up with me over time. I've had numerous fillings (12, if I remember correctly) and had my two top wisdom teeth pulled, but those are by far the least of my worries.

<p>I went to the dentist a few days ago because of my front tooth hurting whenever I would drink something cold. It turns out that my four front teeth require root canals, and if they aren't done by July 22nd, they'll have to extract at least one, if not all of the teeth.

<p>Now on to the bad news. The procedure, in total, will cost $7,736.00 after insurance. I simply do not have that kind of money.

Still, because of what I do for a living, I will have to do commissions almost nonstop for many years to come, and will have no time to do any personal projects or charity projects.</p>
<p>This kind of setback would destroy me psychologically.</p>

<p>As an effort to raise the money required for the procedure, I have started this crowdfunding campaign. I am relying on nothing but people's kindness and understanding in order to get past this very big obstacle in my life and continue showing people the beauty of stained glass.</p>
<p>Even by just sharing this link to your friends, you will be doing me a very serious favor. I understand that not everyone can afford to donate money, since they themselves still need that money for very important reasons.

<p>I am only asking for $7,000 because I am selling my motorcycle as soon as possible, which will fetch about $1,000 (2001 Kawasaki Ninja 500R). The remaining $300 from the $7,736 total will go towards the materials needed to make the Discord stained glass window, which cost about $280-300 in total.</p>
<p>Even if 7,000 people donated just $1, this fundraiser would be tremendously more successful than I would have ever imagined.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>I've since had the four root canals done just hours ago, and I have to say that this is far and away the worst pain I've ever experienced.

<p>A word to the wise: Take care of your front teeth. </p>
</div></div>","Firstly, Who Am I?
I'm best known on the internet as CryoGanix. I am a 19-year-old novice stained glass artisan, currently in training under a master artisan with over 45 years of experience in making stained glass pieces. I've been making glass projects for just under a year now, and have only gotten better with each piece that I've made.


What Makes My Work Unique?
All stained glass artisans—young and old—are taught that a margin of error is acceptable, especially when it comes to small gaps in the glass that can be hidden by lead or filled in with solder. They are taught that most mistakes can be made into opportunities or that the mistakes can be completely hidden by the joining medium.

That is only somewhat true with my work. Instead, I work to make sure each and every individual piece of glass lines up perfectly with the surrounding pieces, forming the tightest and most perfect fit. The only margin of error I will ever accept while making a project (especially for a client, friend, or family member) is cutting away some glass from a piece that is too big. If the glass piece is any smaller than what it needs to be and it forms any type of gap in the pieces, I will put the least complicated piece aside to be used as scrap glass and will re-make that piece.

I believe that everyone should get what they pay for, and they're paying for quality and beauty. I will not stand for anything less than the absolute best that I can do; the quality of my projects are what defines my skill, and that includes how much work and care I put into each and every small piece of glass.
This kind—my kind—of dedication is an extreme rarity these days, especially among the dying art of stained glass.


What Do I Have Planned Next?
As you can see in the image above, I am planning on making a stained glass window (not a suncatcher or hanging piece, but an actual window) of the character Discord from the television show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The project is planned to be 3ft wide by 5ft tall (36"" x 60"").
It will not have any hanging rings attached to it and it is not intended to be hung. This piece is meant to be a permanent addition to your house, whether that's being physically installed in a wall or being the centerpiece of your room of choice (such as on top of a fireplace mantle).
At first, this piece will not be for sale. It will follow me to every convention I go to and serve as a testament that all of you helped make this artisan's dream a reality: to make the stained glass projects that will entertain, amaze, and inspire viewers for years, even decades or centuries.


What's Stopping Me?
For the first 15-16 years of my life, because of my severe ADD, I neglected my physical health and instead focused on what made me happy or what gave me instant satisfaction, such as playing a video game instead of taking a shower or brushing my teeth. As you can imagine, that is a very serious issue, which has unfortunately caught up with me over time. I've had numerous fillings (12, if I remember correctly) and had my two top wisdom teeth pulled, but those are by far the least of my worries. Now, I am on Vyvanse, which is an anti-ADD prescription, and I am taking extreme care of myself and have a lot more concentration when I do stained glass.
I went to the dentist a few days ago because of my front tooth hurting whenever I would drink something cold. It turns out that my four front teeth require root canals, and if they aren't done by July 22nd, they'll have to extract at least one, if not all of the teeth. Because of the very intense time constraint (and no doubt impending pain!), I opted to have the procedure done on Monday, July 15th, which is tomorrow at this time of writing.
Now on to the bad news. The procedure, in total, will cost $7,736.00 after insurance. I simply do not have that kind of money. I fix computers and make stained glass projects for a living, that's it. I have decided to finance the procedure using my grandfather's credit. Still, because of what I do for a living, I will have to do commissions almost nonstop for many years to come, and will have no time to do any personal projects or charity projects.
This kind of setback would destroy me psychologically.
This Is Where You Come In.

Miről van szó?
A LASSULÁS projekt

egy kiállításból és
a Kuckó önkéntes program támogatásából áll.

A kiállítás egyben érzékenyítő tér, a családon belüli erőszakra irányítja a figyelmet.A jelenség 95%-ban nőket érint, ezért a nők elleni diszkrimináció legszélsőségesebb formájának tekinthető.
A kiállítás a falakon lévő képek és a térben elhelyezett érzékenyítő kártyák kontrasztjára épít. A kártyák pontos és hiteles információkat áramoltatnak a látogatók felé a családon belüli erőszak fajtáiról, arról, hogy mik a jelek, mik a tévhitek, hogyan lehet segítséget kérni és hogyan lehet jól segíteni?
A képek egy részével a www.virtualisoromok.blogspot.com oldalon tudsz ismerkedni.Az érzékenyítő kártyák névjegykártya méretűek, elvihetőek. A kártyákon szereplő informatív tartalom mellett mindegyiken fel lesz tüntetve a Nők a Nőkért Együtt az Erőszak Ellen (NANE) Egyesület - mint segítő szervezet - elérhetősége.

Mekkora támogatásra van szükség és hogyan hasznosul?
Körülbelül 111 000 Ft összegyűjtését terveztem, de minimum 500 dollárban határozható meg a célösszeg. Ez valamivel több.
Azt gondolom, ez elérhető cél,  de bármekkora összegű támogatás gyűlik össze, előre fogja vinni a projektet.
Hogyan oszlanak el a felajánlások?

A kapott támogatások 40%-a az érzékenyítő tér létrehozásának költségeit fedezi.
A jobb oldalon láthatod a hozzájárulási lehetőségek listáját. Mindegyikhez tartozik egy ajándék, amivel megköszönjük neked, hogy támogatod a törekvéseinket. Az összeg 20%-át az ajándékok keretezésére, nyomtatására, belföldi postázására fordítom.


A fennmaradó 40% a már említett Kuckó önkéntes programhoz kerül.A Kuckó pártfogoltjai már kiszakadtak a családi otthonból, de a programnak köszönhetően élményeket és hasznos holmikat kapnak. Ha szeretnél többet tudni a csapatról: https://www.facebook.com/kuckoprogram/


Hol tart most a projekt?
A kiállítási anyag elkészült, a kiállító tér megvan. A váci Katona Lajos Városi Könyvtár barátságos hangulatú galériája fogadta be az anyagot. A megnyitó október 6-án, 17.30-kor lesz.

It depends on us, how and where it will lead. The SLOW DOWN project is embedded into this process. It is also important to express that social responsibility can be part of everyday life; in fact it is important that it becomes regular and general. It can start even with a simple click. What other ways are there to help?We have several ideas:• Sharing is caring! Please share this campaign with your friends!• Do you know a person, an association or a company, who would be happy to join the SLOW DOWN project? Thank you for helping us to get in touch! • If you are interested in volunteering, look for KUCKÓ! You can join a fantastic team. Here is a teaser article about them in Hungarian: http://wmn.hu/2016/04/24/kezek-szavak-szivek-ho... A few more interesting thought""If I am in a hurry, I am animated by routine. My body and my thoughts equally. I assess situations from the comfort of learned examples. In order to acquire new perspectives, and to overwrite my own procedures, I have to slow down, maybe even stop for a while.”When the idea of a new exhibition started to take shape in my mind, I was expecting my son. I often remembered the fact, which is since printed on one of the sensitizing cards, that “More than 25% of the victims of domestic violence are beaten even if they are expecting. (In 10% of these cases the beating results in miscarriage.) In some cases the beatings start or become more severe during pregnancy.” (source: nane.hu)    This thought didn’t leave me alone. At the end I have decided that the exhibition cannot be solely art for art’s sake. The tabooing and the derogation of mental or physical injuries solely provide more free room for offenders. I would like to narrow this roomwith my exhibition. Music by Bruno Sanfilippo - Piano textures 3 V - Thank you so much, Bruno for your kind help! https://www.bruno-sanfilippo.comTranslated by Orsolya Bálint",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>HI, I'm Andy! <span style=""background-color: initial;"">And my business, its called Remnant Preservations, its a taxidermy studio- which I suppose makes me a Taxidermist. A year and a half ago I decided I never wanted to sleep soundly again and opened up Remnant Preservations, I have to say its been the hardest and best adventure of my life. </span>
</div>
<div>This campaign is to help me bring Remnant Preservations one step closer to the my full dream, which is providing not only needed services for those who have had pets pass away and preserving wildlife to be respected and admired, but also to provide an educational setting for those students, hobbyists and inquisitive minds. </div>
<div>Your contributions will help me obtain tools for students that will be taking classes learning how to taxidermy in a hands on environment, preserve a variety of animals, participate in bone cleaning and articulations. </div>
<div>In addition to directly supporting and helping Remnant Preservations, I want to use this opportunity to also donate to the <b>Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah.</b> WRCNU is a volunteer based center, meaning it operates solely on donations by its community members. I have many animals I have found injured and on the verge of death to this rehabilitation center and am countlessly blown away by the dedication and hours its volunteers put in (several do unpaid 40 hour work weeks for the sake of helping wildlife recover from man made and naturally caused injuries). I will be donating 15% of the funds raised directly to them, along with outright donations for stretch goal achievements.<i> If you could like to only donate for WRCNU, simply state so in your donation and I will ensure that your full donation goes directly to them</i>

Came through inspired by my then 5 year old cousin Emma- who's name it turns out - means ""wholesome and universal""  . . .You’ve got the UNIVERSE in your hands. I’m not making this up, it really is true – you’ve got the whole universe right here with you.You’ve got the universe in your hands. Let me explain the way hearts and stars may understand.Each star in the night, just like each grain of sand,is made of the same stuff as each woman and man.And each woman and man and all of the childrenand every dog, every cat, and every sweet little kitten,are all made of the same UNIVERSE, far and wide.The very same UNIVERSE that IS you and I.Now, you don’t have to believe this, though what you believe may matter.The TRUTH is you are made of the STARS as they scatter.You are made of the SUN and of this EARTH.But it is of the great and holy words“ I AM ”that we all came to birth!You are made of the winds, and the waves in the sea,of the endless vibration, sweet deep harmony.You are made of LOVE and of POWER and STRENGTH.Of so many things for which we all give thanks!So GIVE THANKS!!!Thank your parents, your ancestors ‘n’ the stars;and give thanks for LOVE, CONSCIOUSNESS, CREATION, CREATOR……YOURSELF.Give thanks for Love ‘n’ YOURSELF, for your come-to-life powers!And give thanks for the fish, the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees.For the high snowy mountains and the sacred, fertile valleys.And for all the good things that have brought you to your feet!And all the things that may bring you to your knees.All that is, all that was, and all that ever will be....And for reminding you, if you wish, some sometimes think to thank me,but I’m just like you; look through true and you’ll see…How I love you so, ever so … oh so dearly.And I will always be here, and you will be too……F O R  I  A M  T H E  U N I V E R S E…And so are you.

    I'm giving this project all the love, 
devotion, intention and attention it deserves... There's all kinds of 
green publishing variables to consider as well (scroll down for more 
details on publishing). For the most part, indegogo support will 
function like a publisher's advance. With funds in place, I will be able
 to focus in on the 30 plus pages of illustrations; which will also become the digital layers for the i pad / tablet book.. This projects 
requires time and concentrated attention.Art is Process...     My 
art is mixed media: nontraditional digital meets analogue. I layer 
photos and sketches as digital collage, play with screen printing and 
alternative printmaking and yes...actual paint. I pour love and prayer 
and life into my creations. See more at AquariusDreams.Com

Epic / Green Publishing
Because this book is about the UNIVERSE being in our hands there is an underlying message of caring for our planet, ourselves and respecting the fact that we are borrowing our resources from the children and the next 7 generations. I know I have to honor nature when I make it. I have a connection for publishing this book in the US at an Environmentally responsible printing company on recycled or, (waiting on print tests,) possibly even Tree Free paper. I am open to offers from other publishing houses as well; but need the message to be respected in the way the book is made. Love that apps can be tree free... I’m aiming to make the full color hardcover version of the book as epic as can be. Your help will allow me to pour love and attention into every square inch of the illustrations and the care of the publishing details for the finished published version. The ""Heart of Gold"" $33 perk ..

Since its inception we knew this installation was destined to travel; that once we share it with the rest of the world it would not only belong to us, but to the many communities that decided to take part of it every year on November 1st and 2nd. Past installations have consisted of us collaborating in creating a structure and designing a Calavera on the outside, and on the inside it houses the community altar where people would come to honor the life of those who have passed and celebrate the legacy they have left with us. We remember them with prayers, songs, candles, dance, food, among many other things people add to the altar. </span></p>

This year’s interactive altar will explore the reasons why people migrate and honor those who have died while in transit. By writing notes to their loved ones on the walls surrounding the altar, symbolically completes the circle of communication between our world and the spirit world. </span></p>With the support of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, a Harlem Based cultural institution, we have been able to accept Councilmember Viverito’s invitation, but we still need to raise an extra $1,500.00 dollars to cover production, promotion, documentation and memorabilia costs for this event that will allow us to connect people from different communities, with this shared experience of remembering those who were here before us by thanking them for having paved our ways into this world.<br/><p></p>

<p>Your contribution would help us bring our project to El Barrio. Our vision is for this installation/celebration to be multi-cultural experience that can eventually be taken to different cities and countries across the world. El Barrio is a diverse community of people that are only familiar with the traditional ways of Dia De Los Muertos. Your contribution will help provide an experience for people of all ethnicities and beliefs to come together as a community and acknowledge the people in their lives that have passed on. The installation will provide a space of honoring, mourning, and most of all celebrating them. </p>
<p>Our previous installations have been successful in many different ways. Our first was created as a celebration between friends and family to come together and share a personal and intimate experience with one another. We also took the opportunity to collaborate together as artists on this project as a representation of community working together with one voice. Our success was in bringing all of our friends and family together as one. Our second installation was very successful in getting the community, local businesses and a local church involved in supporting our project. It was recognized by many different local media and press for our dedication to victims of hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>As artists we are always looking for new ways to express ourselves. Through this expression we know it's our responsibility to also speak for our communities and relate to them as well. Today, we have lost many natural ways of communication, physically and spiritually which have been the foundation of our communities. We want to use this day of celebration to celebrate life, to honor our ancestors who paved the way for us, and to FEEL together as one community.</p>

Your contribution will help provide an experience for people of all ethnicities and beliefs to come together as a community and acknowledge the people in their lives that have passed on. The installation will provide a space of honoring, mourning, and most of all celebrating them. 
Our previous installations have been successful in many different ways. Our first was created as a celebration between friends and family to come together and share a personal and intimate experience with one another. We also took the opportunity to collaborate together as artists on this project as a representation of community working together with one voice. Our success was in bringing all of our friends and family together as one. Our second installation was very successful in getting the community, local businesses and a local church involved in supporting our project. It was recognized by many different local media and press for our dedication to victims of hurricane Sandy.
As artists we are always looking for new ways to express ourselves. Through this expression we know it's our responsibility to also speak for our communities and relate to them as well. Today, we have lost many natural ways of communication, physically and spiritually which have been the foundation of our communities. We want to use this day of celebration to celebrate life, to honor our ancestors who paved the way for us, and to FEEL together as one community.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Simone Miller, and I am a recent graduate of Culver City High School. I'm currently attending CSSSA, the California State Summer School for the Arts, where I'm majoring in Ceramics within the Visual Arts department. The problem is, I'm having trouble paying for this amazing experience, especially as someone who will be attending college this fall.</p>
<p>CSSSA is a summer art ""camp"" at Cal Arts in Valencia, where I'm living and taking intensive art classes for four weeks. I'm living here with other talented artists from all disciplines of art (visual, dance, theatre, animation, film, and music) taking classes from 9AM to sometimes 9PM for six days a week. Here at CSSSA, I'm following the footsteps of my older peers and expanding my knowledge in the arts, something that will help contribute to my future. I will be majoring in Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo this fall, so developing my knowledge of the arts and 3D mediums will help give me an edge to the type of art forms I want to create as an architect. I really view this as one of the most important opportunities I have embarked.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The costs of the program is $1500 in total. I did receieve a $500 scholarship from CSSSA, however there were other elements not included in this fee that racked up the cost back to around $1500, such as art supplies ($140), field trips ($165), and gas and extra food.</p>
<p>Whatever amount of money raised will go towards funding this opportunity here at CSSSA. Any extra money raised will go towards buying necessities for college this fall. </p>
<p>Every day here at CSSSA, I'm having many different adventures with very unique people, and I'm making a wide range of art pieces, so please be excited about the perks, as a way to see what your contributions have helped me create!</p>

In 2015, the team brought the first Finnish installation called “The Pike of Mana” and in 2016 they collaborated with Burners Without Borders to bring “Koulu School” to the Man Base. The idea behind Koulu School is to build a school with minimal resources.

</ul><p> </p><h3>WHY THE ‘COSMIC EGG’?</h3><p>The team has realized that Burning Man is a great testing ground whether it comes to refugee situations or colonizing Mars. The pavilion is a prototype of a parametric, self-load-bearing structure that can easily be scaled up to structures as big as 3000 square meters (32 000 square feet). Because of the optimal durability and efficiency of the design, these types of structures are a common choice when designing structures to be built on the surface of Mars.</p><p>The satellite ground station that is used in the project will be tested for extreme conditions and scalability. The project explores the possibility to build a global, open-source satellite ground station network hosted by public science centers. Some of our project members are affiliated with CERN (The European Organisation for Nuclear Research) and Heureka Science Centre in Finland. The objective would be to bring satellite data available to the greater public.</p><p>The project will produce data for two peer-reviewed papers in management science to learn about holacracy and radical innovations, and two in architecture and structural engineering to learn about a new type of joint design and how to build asymmetric parametrically designed structures with straight blocks. The study will be conducted by researchers at Aalto University in Finland.</p><p> </p><h3>FUNDING</h3><p>This far, the project has been funded with two grants from Finnish foundations 38.000€ in total - and hours and hours of voluntary work. With this money, we have been able to acquire and process the wood for the space dome for Burning Man as well as our prototype in Finland, as well as send the dome to The USA.  Right now, we would need your help in order to make the experience within the dome as amazing as it can be. Altogether, we would need to raise about 20.000 euros (23 000 USD).</p><ul>
<li>Ground station materials &amp; radio equipment</li>
<li>Sound equipment</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Transport (2 Uhaul trucks and gasoline)</li>
<li>Wiring and electronics</li>
<li>Custom-made fire pit </li>
<li>2 x 3000 watt inverter generators (reliable and safe for electronics)</li>
<li>Tools &amp; scaffolding</li>
<li>Shade for the build period</li>
<li>Firewood</li>
<li>Logs around the fire to sit on and other decorations</li>
<li>Indiegogo expenses</li>
<li>Perks, VAT &amp; shipping</li>
</ul><p>As perks, we are offering exclusive items designed for our project by leading Finnish artists and designers.</p><p>Our goal for the fundraising is flexible. The more money we manage to raise, the better the experience will be. With a minimum of 10.000 EUR we can transport the installation to Black Rock City, receive signals from space with a simple antenna, have more modest and less immersive audio-visual experience with scaled-down sound and light equipment. </p><p> </p><h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3><p>The biggest risks for the installation not happening this year are a lack of funding, the installation getting stuck in customs, or force majeure.</p><p>We have made sure that the shipping of the structure is handled according to rules and regulations, all of the pallets are accordingly stamped, and the shipment is properly insured. However, in case the container gets lost, stolen or any other ‘force majeure’-situation happens to it, is naturally out of our reach.</p><p>Moreover, we have made sure that the project does not depend on any single person. In case a key person falls ill, suffers fatality or alien abduction, is denied the entry to United States, then the other project members have the experience and expertise to carry on with the project. The project documentation is available to every project member, and it includes all the necessary tasks and contacts.</p><p>We also avoid dependency on third parties as much as we can. Therefore we take care of the transport and build on our own, and have designed the installation so that it is possible to build without external help or heavy machinery.</p><p>The project team has already constructed one prototype in Finland and has the confidence that the structure can be built in time unless an external influence intervenes with the build schedule.</p><p>In case of extreme weather conditions on the playa during the build, we have to stand down and make sure that the construction can be finished safely.</p><p> </p><h3>FOLLOW AND SHARE</h3><p>To support our campaign and cause, please follow us on social media and invite your friends to participate as well.</p><p>Website: <a href=""http://www.spaceonfire.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.spaceonfire.com</a><br/>Facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/spaceonfire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/spaceonfire</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/spaceonfire_fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.twitter.com/spaceonfire_fi</a><br/>Instagram: @spaceonfire_fi</p><p>IndieGoGo: <a href=""https://igg.me/at/spaceonfire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/spaceonfire</a><br/>#spaceonfire</p><p>ALL PRICES OF THE PERKS ARE INCLUSIVE OF WORLDWIDE SHIPPING AND FINNISH VAT.</p></div>","WHAT WE ARE PLANNINGWe are a community of Finnish architects, artists, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists, and other creatives.

The study will be conducted by researchers at Aalto University in Finland. FUNDINGThis far, the project has been funded with two grants from Finnish foundations 38.000€ in total - and hours and hours of voluntary work. With this money, we have been able to acquire and process the wood for the space dome for Burning Man as well as our prototype in Finland, as well as send the dome to The USA.  Right now, we would need your help in order to make the experience within the dome as amazing as it can be. Altogether, we would need to raise about 20.000 euros (23 000 USD).
Ground station materials & radio equipment
Sound equipment
Lighting
Transport (2 Uhaul trucks and gasoline)
Wiring and electronics
Custom-made fire pit 
2 x 3000 watt inverter generators (reliable and safe for electronics)
Tools & scaffolding
Shade for the build period
Firewood
Logs around the fire to sit on and other decorations
Indiegogo expenses
Perks, VAT & shipping
As perks, we are offering exclusive items designed for our project by leading Finnish artists and designers.Our goal for the fundraising is flexible. The more money we manage to raise, the better the experience will be. With a minimum of 10.000 EUR we can transport the installation to Black Rock City, receive signals from space with a simple antenna, have more modest and less immersive audio-visual experience with scaled-down sound and light equipment.  RISKS & CHALLENGESThe biggest risks for the installation not happening this year are a lack of funding, the installation getting stuck in customs, or force majeure.We have made sure that the shipping of the structure is handled according to rules and regulations, all of the pallets are accordingly stamped, and the shipment is properly insured. However, in case the container gets lost, stolen or any other ‘force majeure’-situation happens to it, is naturally out of our reach.Moreover, we have made sure that the project does not depend on any single person. In case a key person falls ill, suffers fatality or alien abduction, is denied the entry to United States, then the other project members have the experience and expertise to carry on with the project. The project documentation is available to every project member, and it includes all the necessary tasks and contacts.We also avoid dependency on third parties as much as we can. Therefore we take care of the transport and build on our own, and have designed the installation so that it is possible to build without external help or heavy machinery.The project team has already constructed one prototype in Finland and has the confidence that the structure can be built in time unless an external influence intervenes with the build schedule.In case of extreme weather conditions on the playa during the build, we have to stand down and make sure that the construction can be finished safely. FOLLOW AND SHARETo support our campaign and cause, please follow us on social media and invite your friends to participate as well.Website: www.spaceonfire.comFacebook: www.facebook.com/spaceonfireTwitter: www.twitter.com/spaceonfire_fiInstagram: @spaceonfire_fiIndieGoGo: https://igg.me/at/spaceonfire#spaceonfireALL PRICES OF THE PERKS ARE INCLUSIVE OF WORLDWIDE SHIPPING AND FINNISH VAT.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Naira, I'm Argentinian and Milo's mother, who is already 1 year and 8 months old.</p>
<p>I'm a graphic designer, and recently  started a kids event business, which consisted of tents setting and more. At first, the main goal was to have pijamas parties, but then it transformed into a broader array of events.</p>
<p>Decoration includes lighting, wreaths, cushions, dolls, fabric, bed sheets, and my iconic dream-catchers at the top of the tents. Incredibly this has been what  caught the attention the mos. From the beginning people started asking me for them, their prices,  where did I buy them? But they are all homemade by me! I didn't pay attention to this at first, but I felt flattered, tho it wasn't my goal at the time.</p>
<p>Very soon after, I earn a spot at a fair and took my tents, I prepared all decorations just like when I set up my events and It happened again, people asking  me for the dream-catchers, so I immediately thought ""That's it!"" This is what I must focus on!</p>
<p>Now I am in the middle of the quarantine, looking for materials, insisting and asking for delivery. I have already gathered all spare materials I had in home to create and bring to life new models and be able to continue with the project. With the world put on a hold, it is the perfect moment to create, reconnect with art, and hand-craft. I'm fully inspired to continue bringing life to this project, to keep creating my beautiful dream-catchers, and filling people with joy.</p>
<p>That's why I have created an Indiegogo Campaign, with your help I can continue to bringing joy not just by selling them, but helping you creating them. With this goal and teaching I will be able to expand myself,tell you their stories  and their meaning.</p>
<p>To thank your support, videos, tips, tricks, history and meaning are included,so you can also  create magic from home, in family and with much love!</p>
<p>Making dream-catchers is a therapy, the dedication and love of crafting them fills us with satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Short Summary of the Visual art Exhibition</h3>
<p>I am Peipei Li and major in Business Design and Art leadership at Savannah College of Art and Design. I curate a contemporary visual art exhibition entitled Sweet Aspirin, which is a look of the inside of social concern such as obesity, child abuse, suicide, feminism and artificial intelligence by the artist Xiaolu Zhang.</p>
<p>Social concerns affect people’s life a lot. My purpose of doing this exhibition is to encourage people to pay more attention to the current issues such as obesity, child abuse, and suicide, and give more care to those people and Savannah citizens via the exhibiting Zhang’s artwork.</p>
<p>Sweet Aspirin addresses as a tool to begin a conversation that people will want to talk about those topics but they don't know how to talk about it, with ART. People who are suffering and not suffering from those topics can be on the same page when they look at the paintings.  The exhibition will give people a chance to know more about having a positive attitude to look at those social concerns. It will also give local help.</p>
<p>The exhibition <i>is a </i>3-day project event including 20 pieces of exhibiting works. Each piece of artwork reflects a different topic from the social concerns that people are curious. It will be FREE and open to the public, from May 11th - May 13th, at Sulfur Studios in Savannah Ga.</p>

<h3>About Under Our Skin</h3>
<p>Under Our Skin is a mixed-media visual and textile art class for women in  Simcoe County, Ontario. The project explores stability, self-worth and common ground through art-making.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507305612/s5mn6humwsj5lzvd0vff.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Created and taught by Barrie artist/educators Mar Lewis and Susan Kendal, Under Our Skin explores various visual and textile art techniques.</p>
<p>We’ve partnered with Redwood Park Communities and its United House, which offer transitional housing and a multitude of resources to women.</p>
<p>Since our initial sessions last year in the fall of 2016, we've worked with watercolours, acrylics, yarn, stitching, screen printing, weaving (integrating both natural and artificial fibres), two-dimensional wall art, and three-dimensional sculptural art.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507305649/xtv8gv0kc8bkukqkkbc2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Ideas of belonging, community, self-reflection and perspective are gently woven into the work that we create. Under Our Skin has become a touchstone for participants and teachers alike: a welcoming, engaging social space where we can share a coffee or tea and the camaraderie inherent in shared artistic work.</p>
<p>Classes are free-of-charge for participants from the United House community, and the House contributes rides and childcare if needed, making this class as barrier-free to attend as possible. </p>
<p>The class is also open to women in the greater local community through application and a nominal course fee. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507306392/bdqdess5u3uzwbwlc03p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $2000 to go towards our gallery show expenses -- in which we're sharing all the work we did over the last year in a public show -- and to cover the costs of classes in the fall and early winter of 2017/18.</li>
<li>What are the perks for donating? Besides a lovely warm feeling of benevolence, you'll see you can choose from an original lino print by Susan and Mar; a set of postcards featuring some stellar student artwork; artist prints of a recent piece of Mar's; original embroidered paper art by Susan; and a mystery art mailing where you get three *surprise* pieces by Susan and Mar, mailed separately and randomly over six months -- how do you even choose?! </li>
<li>But! If you prefer not to have a perk (which is fine!), you can simply choose the ""Back It"" button at the top right of this page, then you can choose your own amount. And we won't send you anything, but we WILL send you huge vibes of love and thanks! </li>
<li>The funds raised go to teacher-fees, materials costs, rental of our studio space, food and coffee (an integral part of our program is the social aspect, spending our first 45 minutes visiting and coffee-ing), and the costs of our current 2016/17 gallery show (things like wall prep, hanging materials, printing and staffing). </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507306375/c1lcjf8cs6rhnkvbnjvh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We hope to offer more classes this fall. These classes </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">are </span>important<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to the students who already enjoy coming, and we'd love to welcome new women also. </span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We'd like to carry some continuity </span>after<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> establishing a weekly schedule of </span>classes<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> from January to June (with funding from the Ontario Arts Council), and to keep our connections fresh with one another. </span>
</li>
<li><font>It's a powerful thing to be able to offer this work cost-free to students who don't necessarily have the financial means. </font></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​We know from </span>participant feedback and United House staff feedback that this program is having a profound impact on many lives, and your support will help this work continue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Practicality</h3>
<p>Regardless of this campaign, we will be offering two or three fall and winter classes to our current students to make sure we stay connected and have a chance to be creative together at least a little bit. We are deeply committed to this work, while also working to manage our voluntary commitments.  </p>
<p>If we achieve our fundraising goal of $2000, we'll be able to offer two classes per month from October through January. This is our hope for the success of this campaign!</p>

Under Our Skin is a mixed-media visual and textile art class for women in  Simcoe County, Ontario. The project explores stability, self-worth and common ground through art-making.

Created and taught by Barrie artist/educators Mar Lewis and Susan Kendal, Under Our Skin explores various visual and textile art techniques.
We’ve partnered with Redwood Park Communities and its United House, which offer transitional housing and a multitude of resources to women.
Since our initial sessions last year in the fall of 2016, we've worked with watercolours, acrylics, yarn, stitching, screen printing, weaving (integrating both natural and artificial fibres), two-dimensional wall art, and three-dimensional sculptural art.


Ideas of belonging, community, self-reflection and perspective are gently woven into the work that we create. Under Our Skin has become a touchstone for participants and teachers alike: a welcoming, engaging social space where we can share a coffee or tea and the camaraderie inherent in shared artistic work.
Classes are free-of-charge for participants from the United House community, and the House contributes rides and childcare if needed, making this class as barrier-free to attend as possible. 
The class is also open to women in the greater local community through application and a nominal course fee. 

What We Need & What You Get

We are looking to raise $2000 to go towards our gallery show expenses -- in which we're sharing all the work we did over the last year in a public show -- and to cover the costs of classes in the fall and early winter of 2017/18.
What are the perks for donating? Besides a lovely warm feeling of benevolence, you'll see you can choose from an original lino print by Susan and Mar; a set of postcards featuring some stellar student artwork; artist prints of a recent piece of Mar's; original embroidered paper art by Susan; and a mystery art mailing where you get three *surprise* pieces by Susan and Mar, mailed separately and randomly over six months -- how do you even choose?! 
But! If you prefer not to have a perk (which is fine!), you can simply choose the ""Back It"" button at the top right of this page, then you can choose your own amount. And we won't send you anything, but we WILL send you huge vibes of love and thanks! 
The funds raised go to teacher-fees, materials costs, rental of our studio space, food and coffee (an integral part of our program is the social aspect, spending our first 45 minutes visiting and coffee-ing), and the costs of our current 2016/17 gallery show (things like wall prep, hanging materials, printing and staffing). 



The Impact


We hope to offer more classes this fall. These classes are important to the students who already enjoy coming, and we'd love to welcome new women also. 


We'd like to carry some continuity after establishing a weekly schedule of classes from January to June (with funding from the Ontario Arts Council), and to keep our connections fresh with one another. 

It's a powerful thing to be able to offer this work cost-free to students who don't necessarily have the financial means. 

​We know from participant feedback and United House staff feedback that this program is having a profound impact on many lives, and your support will help this work continue.

Practicality
Regardless of this campaign, we will be offering two or three fall and winter classes to our current students to make sure we stay connected and have a chance to be creative together at least a little bit. We are deeply committed to this work, while also working to manage our voluntary commitments.  
If we achieve our fundraising goal of $2000, we'll be able to offer two classes per month from October through January. This is our hope for the success of this campaign!

<p>Back in the Olden Dayes of Yon Internette, before there was 
Webkinz, NeoPets, or DeviantART, artists traded adoptable 
pets between their free homepages. Some of these virtual adoption 
centers were surely scams, but others were just set up by artists who 
wanted to share their work.  It was an interesting social scene in the 
days before the web was social.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Some of these could get pretty

<h3>Bringing the Analog Virtual Pet Back<br/>

<p>So
 in homage to those early days of online interaction, I'm offering BlagOPets for adoption. 
 Each one is completely unique and hand-drawn by me.  Here's an example:</p>

<p>When you adopt you will get a graphic like this one in your email, to share on your 
blog or just to enjoy.  But that won't be all!  Your BlagOPet will also 
have adventures like this one:</p>

<p>At least two things will happen to your BlagOPet.  I'll be sending you

 of genuine virtual pet ownership ahead of you, with all the joys it brings.</p>

Story
WHO:
Green
Provocateur is an urban art and language intervention appearing around the
world as an invitation to people, buildings and green worlds to converse,
create and explore new interspecies relationships. 
 
At
the heart of Green Provocateur are two artists with a passion for public art experience and experiments who invite YOU to join them! 
 
Specifically, we are: Paul Clemence, sprung from the heat of Brazil, a passionate artist and architecture-lover and Jade Dressler, a well-caffeinated NYC publicist
and art curator who, beneath her big hats and stilettos, has a heart that beats to a
bikini loincloth ecstasy anywhere in Nature. Our travels together in Italy and 6-months of emails from Europe to New York birthed the seeds of
Green Provocateur. One year after our first conversations, we are thrilled to be launching a Green Provocateur project in Milan during Salone, the international design fair!
 
We
imagine, that all over the world’s greatest cities, Green Provocateur will
appear suddenly, like wild and teasing seeds, surprising and seductive landings
of green life sown within a city’s architecture.
 
WHAT: Green Provocateur will make its debut in Milan as a
large scale outdoor photo installation ( approximately 15 x 50 feeet) printed on eco-friendly paper
and planted upon the walls of Via Pepe, bordering Milan’s Garibaldi
station. A formally drab and uninspired staircase to the train platform will feature images by photographer Paul Clemence, taken around
the globe of the unlikely cross-pollinating intersections of green and
architecture. 

WHEN: April 12-17. Green Provocateur appears at the invitation of the cultural organization, AMAZElab, who for 8 years has produced the Green Island
satellite Green Design Salone during Salone Internazionale del
Mobile, the
famed international design fair where over 300,000 people, including 5000
journalists flock to Milan. The Green Island fair has seeded the idea of green into the
urban fabric around the avant-garde and transitional neighborhood of Isola.
 
HOW + WHY: Green Provocateur believes in bringing art outside of traditional spaces as a participatory art experience. We invite the
public to share in the dialogue and experience both on-site in the urban
environment and in the conversations online.  Green Provocateur is a
project of the creative agency PLANT., seeding conceptual experiences
for artists and the public.
 
THE
IMPACT: We hope
Green Provocateur will encourage people to slow down, taking time to notice or
think about alternative realities of the other species we share the planet
with. Our goal is a perception shift, for us all to step beyond adopting
eco-friendly habits and emotionally connect with the physical presence of green
in connection to where we are as individuals and as an imaginative species. 
 
WHAT
IF?  Even if our campaign does not reaches its funding goal, the
project will be realized. But if the project cannot be funded to the
fullest extent that Green Provocateur envisions, the project may have to reduce its final scale and that will make us sad. We stay happy as friends join in and support the project around the world!
 
CAN YOU SEE IT TOO? Green
Provocateur has set its sights on cities around the world and we envision Green Provocateur as an adventure with many people joining in.
 
DO YOU ACCEPT THE MISSION?
What You Can Do: Funds
raised will go to development, materials and installation costs.
 
What
You Get: All
contributor's names will be listed on the site in Milan and on the Green
Provocateur blog for the world to see. 

You Get Perks too! Green Provocateur prints and New York City tours of public art.

Other
Ways You Can Be A Green Provocateur

Provocateur welcomes partners to realize these dialogues and welcomes funding from other
like-minded, passionate Green Provocateurs. Funders to the Green Provocateur:

Originally the San Juan Ridge was the territory of the Nisenan Maidu tribe in the heart of the Yuba River watershed. During the 1850s, western settlers moved in to mine for gold.

<p>My name is Josiah Ham (AKA) ZERO. I am an artist based in the SF Bay Area. I am the author of EVGIEP (Every Video Game I've Ever Played), ACZ (Art Collection Zero), and Cross My Heart Hope To Die, my debut novel. I am also the sketcher / curator of Portraits Int'l. I have been a stay @ home father for five years. I would like to sell art and use the money to start an organice farm / educational center here in Kenwood California, my hometown (see pic above). THANK YOU FOR LOOKING! IT MEANS SO MUCH!!!!</p>

<p>I'm asking for $10,000. I need to buy a nice printer / scanner / copier, a new  computer, etc, I would like to be able to get ACZ an ISBN #, purchase Adobe Cs6, paper, ink, etc. I'm going to need to pay for shipping. I am going to get my pieces printed on canvas, and rent a space by my house for an art show / installation, buying and printing stickers, etc.  the rest will go to support my wife and children, Farm start up, so either way you are giving to a noble / worthy cause.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I feel horrible asking for a handout. If I had access to credit cards, or other forms of loans / credit I would totally finance myself, regretably I am not in that position. So any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My perks are very special, unique, and rare. My artistic integrity is high, so unfortunately I cannot sell first edition copies cheap. I mean seriously my life is very important / special. I am a very controversial artist on the rise. Each book will will printed on the finest paper, and hand bound by me personally!</p>
<p>If you purchase a first edition copy of my book ACZ I will refund your money in 10 years, provided I can afford it without going broke. I will put this in wiriting and include with every first edition copy. The only condition is being you keep the book the whole time, and are able to present it prior to refund.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My book Art Collection Zero is a groundbreaking work. Very unique. Part trolling, part genius, the author really goes in and bears all for the world to see. It is historical, and the books is a contribution to the movement for a better tomorrow. It is the expression of a soul. It is your chance to be a part of that, to OWN a part of that, to essentially own a PART OF ME. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>All contributions I get will go toward printing my work, and finishing my novel and EVGIEP, etc. Ultimately I sell my art to start my farm.

<div>
<i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Reality is not entirely what we are made to believe it is:  </i>We can be the carvers of our own path, our own truth, our own vision.</div>
<div>
<i style=""font-weight: bold;"">You are a Genius: </i>Our current society functions on the demeaning and devaluing of ourselves, each other and our environment. The truth is, we are all geniuses in our own right. We are all powerful beyond measure. </div>
<div>
<i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our Alienation is a Sign of our Collective Potential: </i>The separation from our inner truths, the separation from our neighbours, our children, from our Earth have led us to operate from fear and tension. When we can pierce through such false illusions of division, we can make powerful micro- and macro-changes.</div>
<div>
<i style=""font-weight: bold;"">We Belong to the Earth and Cosmos:</i> We are aliens who live on Earth, which is connected to the Cosmos. We are all interconnected.</div>
<div>Through the use of video, media and workshop facilitation, Alien Nation is a project  committed to the creation and sharing of new stories powered by science-fiction storytelling, to carve pathways to new futures for ourselves and generations to come.</div>
<h3>In Love and Light:</h3>
<div>
<p>My name is Sharrae Lyon and I'm the Creative Director. I am an afrofuturist, time-traveler, dream catcher, creator, lover. I am a spirit living a human existence. I am in flaw and in perfection. I believe in the powerful capacity of individual liberation not as an idea, but as an active force of resistance that can contribute to community change.  The elevation of one, must contribute to and inspire the elevation of all. Thus, I desire to follow the steps of my ancestors and predecessors of creating a future that breaks out of the confines of imposed existence.</p>
<p>I believe we are mirrors of each other.</p>
<p>I believe we are the shapers of our existence.</p>
<p>I believe we can change and alter the course of history and of the future.</p>
<p>I believe we are much more powerful than what they let us on to believe.</p>
<p>I believe in music and dance as an avenue of healing the spirit.</p>
<p>I believe in you and in us, as a community.</p>
</div>
<p>___</p>
<h3><span style="""">Creative and Professional Development:</span></h3>
<p>I believe in the importance of creating content that inspires the light in others. I have been honoured and privileged to meet amazing people who have inspired me; artists, teachers, friends, family. With that being said, to create art that incorporates spirituality, critical political grounding that is infused with love, I decided to take Alien Nation into an artist-in-residency program with d'bi.young anitafrika at the Watah School through the inaugural Transdisciplinary Artist Program (TAP) in Toronto.  ""<a href=""http://watah.org/residencies/tap-transdisciplinary-artist-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TAP</a> is geared towards artists who create cross-genre works of art or art that defy traditional categorization.""</p>
<p>In the past year, Alien Nation has delivered workshops in Canada and the United States including Detroit's Allied Media Conference that utilized the concepts of alien-identity to search for answers of our personal potential. I desire to see Alien Nation mature into a creative vision that can continue to incorporate ancient and modern knowledges to facilitate healing of ourselves and of our ancestors through effective facilitation and creative content birthed with integrity and intention.</p>
<p>I feel so honoured and inspired by those I have met along the way in Alien Nation's journey. Below is a testimonial of one of my participants who shared how her participation in a workshop affected her:</p>
<p>""A true soul sister, a fellow believer in higher power, a mystic being rocking this human life on earth with beautiful intention. The work she does is unlike any. They energy she creates, emits and evokes is medicine from the depths of the universe. She is an alien empress spreading love, wisdom and magic, connecting ancient history to the present and the future and reminding us of our capacities as beings on this planet. Big big love and deep respect.""</p>

</div></div>","Alien Nation Carving New Pathways, New Futures:

Reality is not entirely what we are made to believe it is:  We can be the carvers of our own path, our own truth, our own vision.

You are a Genius: Our current society functions on the demeaning and devaluing of ourselves, each other and our environment. The truth is, we are all geniuses in our own right. We are all powerful beyond measure. 

Our Alienation is a Sign of our Collective Potential: The separation from our inner truths, the separation from our neighbours, our children, from our Earth have led us to operate from fear and tension. When we can pierce through such false illusions of division, we can make powerful micro- and macro-changes.

We Belong to the Earth and Cosmos: We are aliens who live on Earth, which is connected to the Cosmos. We are all interconnected.
Through the use of video, media and workshop facilitation, Alien Nation is a project  committed to the creation and sharing of new stories powered by science-fiction storytelling, to carve pathways to new futures for ourselves and generations to come.
In Love and Light:

My name is Sharrae Lyon and I'm the Creative Director. I am an afrofuturist, time-traveler, dream catcher, creator, lover. I am a spirit living a human existence. I am in flaw and in perfection. I believe in the powerful capacity of individual liberation not as an idea, but as an active force of resistance that can contribute to community change.  The elevation of one, must contribute to and inspire the elevation of all. Thus, I desire to follow the steps of my ancestors and predecessors of creating a future that breaks out of the confines of imposed existence.
I believe we are mirrors of each other.
I believe we are the shapers of our existence.
I believe we can change and alter the course of history and of the future.
I believe we are much more powerful than what they let us on to believe.
I believe in music and dance as an avenue of healing the spirit.
I believe in you and in us, as a community.

___
Creative and Professional Development:
I believe in the importance of creating content that inspires the light in others. I have been honoured and privileged to meet amazing people who have inspired me; artists, teachers, friends, family. With that being said, to create art that incorporates spirituality, critical political grounding that is infused with love, I decided to take Alien Nation into an artist-in-residency program with d'bi.young anitafrika at the Watah School through the inaugural Transdisciplinary Artist Program (TAP) in Toronto.  ""TAP is geared towards artists who create cross-genre works of art or art that defy traditional categorization.""
In the past year, Alien Nation has delivered workshops in Canada and the United States including Detroit's Allied Media Conference that utilized the concepts of alien-identity to search for answers of our personal potential. I desire to see Alien Nation mature into a creative vision that can continue to incorporate ancient and modern knowledges to facilitate healing of ourselves and of our ancestors through effective facilitation and creative content birthed with integrity and intention.
I feel so honoured and inspired by those I have met along the way in Alien Nation's journey. Below is a testimonial of one of my participants who shared how her participation in a workshop affected her:

Corte
Moronati Artist-inResidence program will allow artists to take time

their art. The residency offers both a two week and a month long free
live/work space for visual artists, writers, composers, and other
creatives.
The
money raised with this campaign will be used solely for

Buying
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS for the renovation of the artist's working
space in the attic of the residency's building. Covering the
first three months of the residency's lease and bills.No
individual compensation for labor is being paid through this project.About me and my dream: Share this excitement with me and the upcoming resident artists!
My
name is Giada Crispiels and I am an artist who for the last two years
has been traveling in the US participating in a series of residency
programs.Through my personal experience I found that this special
opportunity (being part of a residency program) gives artists the
chance to see their work change and offers new perspectives on their
art.This the reason why I am thrilled to now to have the chance
to offer other artists the same opportunity I have been given in
recent years.
I
invite you to be a part of this exciting
project with me and the upcoming resident artists!(View of the residency building of the residency and the B&B Le Castellane)More about the location
The
site of the residency will be in the 14th century, three story
building that houses the B&B Le Castellane in Sirmione, Italy.
The
first floor is part of the ""Le Castellane"" B&B complex
and the second floor will host the residents. The attic floor will be
a shared studio space, open 24/7 to the residents.
Sirmione
is a comune in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy (Northern Italy).
It is bounded by the comunes of Desenzano del Garda (Lombardy) and
Peschiera del Garda in the province of Verona and the region of
Veneto. It is a historical center located on the Sirmio peninsula

I
	have the building! I have the contacts! Here's what I need to do
	now:


I
	need to raise $3000 for the RENOVATION of the STUDIO-WORK SPACE,
	which is situated in the attic of the residency building.(I need

<p>My name is Britt and I am an artist living in Canberra, Australia.</p>
<p>I absolutely love making black and white mandalas and creations, equipped with just a compass and a handful of Sharpies. Taking influence from tattoo culture, Indian henna and a love of geometrical symmetry my pieces are designed to catch your eye.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise enough money so that I can do a tattoo course to learn the proper technique and safety requirements to start my own tattoo experiments.</p>
<p>Tattoos are one of my biggest obsessions and I gain so much influence from them that I really want to get involved and follow a dream.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The course I want to do goes through designs, stencils, equipment, safety, first aid, techniques, shading, portraiture - pretty much everything you can imagine and is $800.</p>
<p>Along with that I will need all the equipment and materials to practice which I've budgeted at $200.</p>
<p>Anything you can contribute is amazing and gets me just that little bit closer to exploring something that I've always had a insatiable passion for.</p>

<p><em> ""To sum up the work of BRT in words is nearly impossible. Fusing geometric patterns with ancient symbolism and pop culture, her work is utterly unique and revolutionary. Like all the great artists, each piece of work is something of a layered experience, the face, the structure and the feeling it gives. Henry David Thoreau once said “It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.” This has never been more evident than in these hypnotic designs</em><br/><br/><em>The detail and time BRT puts into her art (and all aspects of life) has seen her unique brand of art develop into something of a true visionary. Be it music, jewellery, fashion or multimedia, BRT is ever changing but always adaptive. Always pushing herself that one step further where the only downtime is incubation for another amazing piece just waiting to be set free.</em><br/><br/><em>I’ll be donating to this project because BRT is a true creative and that means that I’ll be funding not only a project but an exciting future.

I absolutely love making black and white mandalas and creations, equipped with just a compass and a handful of Sharpies. Taking influence from tattoo culture, Indian henna and a love of geometrical symmetry my pieces are designed to catch your eye.
My goal is to raise enough money so that I can do a tattoo course to learn the proper technique and safety requirements to start my own tattoo experiments.
Tattoos are one of my biggest obsessions and I gain so much influence from them that I really want to get involved and follow a dream.
 
The course I want to do goes through designs, stencils, equipment, safety, first aid, techniques, shading, portraiture - pretty much everything you can imagine and is $800.
Along with that I will need all the equipment and materials to practice which I've budgeted at $200.
Anything you can contribute is amazing and gets me just that little bit closer to exploring something that I've always had a insatiable passion for.
 
 
 ""To sum up the work of BRT in words is nearly impossible. Fusing geometric patterns with ancient symbolism and pop culture, her work is utterly unique and revolutionary. Like all the great artists, each piece of work is something of a layered experience, the face, the structure and the feeling it gives. Henry David Thoreau once said “It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.” This has never been more evident than in these hypnotic designsThe detail and time BRT puts into her art (and all aspects of life) has seen her unique brand of art develop into something of a true visionary. Be it music, jewellery, fashion or multimedia, BRT is ever changing but always adaptive. Always pushing herself that one step further where the only downtime is incubation for another amazing piece just waiting to be set free.I’ll be donating to this project because BRT is a true creative and that means that I’ll be funding not only a project but an exciting future. I’m excited to see more from BRT the tattoo artist and one day hope to be in a chair knowing my skin is in safe hands.Keep on the lookout because she is destined to become the next big thing!""Liam (the happy owner of a BRT original.) – Melbourne VIC",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hello! My name is Melody Brink. Thanks for taking an interest in supporting me! Please find more information about why I need your support down below, and have a look at the unique gifts you can get in return! A tip: many of them make great Christmas gifts as well! 
Why I need your support In the last years I have been on a journey with the intention to find my role in the world.

There I was introduced to the idea of human beings being capable of perceiving qualities in the world. I started to wonder about our current societies and how I could contribute bringing about world healing. To find my voice and continue my investigation of the imagination, I studied at the International School of Storytelling in , where I learned about the heart and craft of the storyteller. Since then, I have been telling stories, have been deepening my connection with nature through Geomancy, and have enrolled in a masters program at  to study Social Sculpture.

Social Sculpture is a phrase that was coined by the artist Joseph Beuys in the 1970’s. It is a field of study that works with inner imagination and how this can bring about outer transformation. ‘Social sculpture is concerned with exploring strategies, methods and principles that enable us to see, to understand and to act imaginatively to shape a humane and ecologically viable world. It emphasizes the role of imagination in transformative social process and the centrality of alternative modes of thought.’  I decided to join the masters program because I wanted to deepen all of the questions I already had started to ask, and to start to find creative forms that I could use to bring about world healing.

The reality of our situation is that if we don't make at least $12,000, we will be in debt. We've cut bells and whistles to get our budget as small as we can for the playa this year, and we'll improve it over the course of the next year.Can you help us stay out of debt and meet our revised goal by Thursday? ****************************************************************THE VULVATRONThe Vulvatron is an interactive, immersive mobile art environment that honors the female form using video projections, responsive LEDs, sound, and scent. Its compelling visual and interactive concepts enable a dynamic exchange of experiences between all participants. The environment responds, embraces, and transforms all who choose to interact.DESCRIPTIONThe Vulvatron consists of 3 main features: The Vulva & Clitoris, The Erogenous Zone, and Mobility.

The Vulva and ClitorisThe Vulva is two 18’ tall video projection screens made of 4-way stretch fabric. Live video artists will perform projection-mapped video and multi media sets. Participants can play with a Kinect motion and proximity sensor to affect the projections. The Vulva lips are lined with RGB addressable LED strips that process the live video. The Clitoris is a 36” diameter acrylic dome lined with super-bright LED lights, hanging at the peak of the Vulva screens. When participants touch pressure sensors located inside the Erogenous Zone, both the Clitoris and the Vulva light up in programmed responsive animations.




The Erogenous ZoneGet cozy in the EZ! This community connection space is an immersive, total sensory environment. Noises of natures hum and vibrate while soft female voices coo and murmur in the background. Gentle scents waft by from our custom-crafted aromatherapy essences. Settle into the velvety cushions and open your heart and mind to the present moment.


The MobilityThe Vulva & the Erogenous Zones are mounted on a 16’ trailer, which is towed by a costumed vehicle. This maximizes the Vulvatron’s ability to be experienced at a variety of events, either as a stationary installation or a wandering installation.

The exhibition - <i>Pitchtree, Peachtree, Nickel Bottom, too</i> - explores Peachtree Creek and its surroundings. As a site-specific project, <i>Pitchtree, Peachtree, Nickel Bottom, too</i> digs into (at times quite literally) the layers that make up the Creek, specifically the Zonolite District where {Poem 88}, the hosting gallery, is located. The Muscogee lived along Peachtree Creek, and Standing Peachtree was a hub village just up the creek from where Zonolite district is now. The name of the community garden at Zonolite Park is named Nickel Bottom, rumored to have been named by a community of freed men and women. Not to mention the pivotal Battle of Peachtree Creek. Later, the district was turned into an industrial complex that produced asbestos. Now, the community is working to clean up the environmental damage and produce a new community. </p>
<p>The plan is to use {Poem 88} as a studio for research and production, gallery, and event space, so throughout the month there will be public programming including presentations, performances, and workshops to engage the community in the work and the landscape. And, since I'll be using the gallery as a studio, I'll be producing a lot of the work in house! FUN! I'm inviting the community to participate in this process-based research project alongside me! Since <i>Pitchtree, Peachtree, Nickel Bottom, too</i> is interested in illuminating the various communities and infrastructures that have inhabited the area through time, it is only right to invite those that are there now to join me! You can participate in so many ways! (BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE PERKS FOR SOME SPECIFICS OF THAT!)</p>
<p>The exhibition will constantly transform throughout the month. I will be gathering and collecting samples, data, archival materials, photographs, video, and audio recordings, and display or present them in some way in the gallery. Culminating projects will be a cassette tape &amp; zine/book. The tape will feature field recordings, live sessions, and compositions made during the course of the exhibition. The zine/book will feature writings, images, and archival information produced and gathered during the exhibition. The aim of the tape &amp; zine/book is for the project to live another life beyond the weeks it lived within the gallery walls. </p>

<p>Now, a bit about me: I'm Meredith Kooi - a visual and performance artist, curator, critic, educator, and major supporter of the Atlanta arts community. Even though I've been a practicing artist for almost a decade, and have supported many artists in ATL &amp; beyond, it's been hard securing the resources needed to produce my OWN work. BUT, I'm finally going to be having my first solo exhibition THIS SUMMER at {Poem 88}! (July 9 - August 6)<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of my recent projects have been site-responsive installations and performances that use radio broadcast as a way to explore the particular place. These projects include <i>(RIP) Van Winkle on Air</i>, which was installed at The Goat Farm Arts Center and <i>tettix chorus for the unmarked</i> at Historic Oakland Cemetery, among others. Other performance and visual work has been presented throughout Atlanta at venues such as Kibbee Gallery, Chastain
Arts Center, MINT Gallery, Mammal Gallery, Eyedrum, and a performance
at the High for a College Night. The group shows that I've curated as
ALTERED MEANS have been presented at Mammal Gallery and Murmur, and
included public programming and publications. 
</p>
<p>

<p>
I
am currently an artist-in-residence with The Creatives Project, have
a forthcoming residency at Wave Farm (Acra, NY), and have completed
residencies at Hambidge Center (Rabun Gap, GA), Elsewhere
(Greensboro, NC), and betterArts (Redwood, NY).

<h2>TESTIMONIALS &amp; PREVIOUS WORKS</h2>
</div><div></div><p>""Every one of Meredith Kooi's performances, art installations, or curatorial projects I've ever been to has been thoughtful, well-developed, and engaging. She explores challenging and complex ideas and then makes them seem intuitive. "" ~ Chelsea Dunn, Director of Ladyfest ATL, member of experimental band Dux<br/></p><p>""Kooi thrives in communicating her
ideas and concepts. She's an excellent conversationalist and psychic
medium. Her artistic integrity stems from a deep understanding of
human kind and its relation to outerspace, unicorns, and spirits. She
hears and sees things you don't. Watch out for this one! ~ Alice Kim,
musician</p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">“Meredith is like a reptile. She
remains positioned for a period of time without reveal. When she acts
there is an immediacy. I found this especially ingnited through the
flood of laughter in her. She is at that moment your childhood
friend. Kooi is part scientist, part kanoodler. She dissects rhythms
in order to offer you another glimpse at reason. The methods are just
as much for her process as those around her.” ~ Kirstin Mitchell
(sometimes aka Kiki Blood), performance artist</span></p>
<p>

of 85% of Atlanta's stolen radios. She really needs your cash for new

</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>THE IMPACT</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I
believe this project is important in, at least, a few ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>HISTORICALLY: ATL has a complex history that is worth exploring and bringing to a larger national and international audience. My hope is that the exhibition starts something that can continue into the future in multiple forms. The tape &amp; digital download can be listened to by others. The zine can be picked up, handled, and read at a future date. A web archive provides easy access for those far away.</li>
<li>ART HISTORICALLY: Art of the American Southeast has been marked by conversations of regionalism and place - I aim to bring these ideologies into play and question the relationships we create between the landscape, people, animals, plants, aesthetic choices, and audience. I think that continuing to develop site-specific installation and performance projects in ATL pushes and transgresses disciplinary boundaries -- important challenges. </li>
<li>CULTURALLY: One of the main goals of the project is to bring to light the various communities that have inhabited the area and keep them in mind in the many important conversations the city is having about present and future development. With ATL's burgeoning development, projects like this can help cultivate responsibility &amp; accountability to place.</li>
<li>YOU!: For a while now I've been supporting other artists' work, so if you support me, you'll be me to me! </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><b>PREVIOUS SUCCESSES, or, why you should trust me...</b></p>
<p>As a
curator and organizer for ALTERED MEANS and Radius, I have
successfully attained funding for projects. As ALTERED MEANS, I
raised money for the exhibition I curated <i>EXTREME WEATHER</i> that
was at Murmur in December 2015 – this led to a successful
exhibition that was positively reviewed, multiple public programs,
and the completion of the print publication. With Radius, I helped us
obtain a Propeller Fund grant, a re-granting agency of the Andy
Warhol Foundation, in order to commission artists to produce work for
our series GRIDS and also publish a booklet documenting the year-long
series.</p>

The name of the community garden at Zonolite Park is named Nickel Bottom, rumored to have been named by a community of freed men and women. Not to mention the pivotal Battle of Peachtree Creek. Later, the district was turned into an industrial complex that produced asbestos. Now, the community is working to clean up the environmental damage and produce a new community. 
The plan is to use {Poem 88} as a studio for research and production, gallery, and event space, so throughout the month there will be public programming including presentations, performances, and workshops to engage the community in the work and the landscape. And, since I'll be using the gallery as a studio, I'll be producing a lot of the work in house! FUN! I'm inviting the community to participate in this process-based research project alongside me! Since Pitchtree, Peachtree, Nickel Bottom, too is interested in illuminating the various communities and infrastructures that have inhabited the area through time, it is only right to invite those that are there now to join me! You can participate in so many ways! (BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE PERKS FOR SOME SPECIFICS OF THAT!)
The exhibition will constantly transform throughout the month. I will be gathering and collecting samples, data, archival materials, photographs, video, and audio recordings, and display or present them in some way in the gallery. Culminating projects will be a cassette tape & zine/book. The tape will feature field recordings, live sessions, and compositions made during the course of the exhibition. The zine/book will feature writings, images, and archival information produced and gathered during the exhibition. The aim of the tape & zine/book is for the project to live another life beyond the weeks it lived within the gallery walls. 


Now, a bit about me: I'm Meredith Kooi - a visual and performance artist, curator, critic, educator, and major supporter of the Atlanta arts community. Even though I've been a practicing artist for almost a decade, and have supported many artists in ATL & beyond, it's been hard securing the resources needed to produce my OWN work. BUT, I'm finally going to be having my first solo exhibition THIS SUMMER at {Poem 88}! (July 9 - August 6)


Most of my recent projects have been site-responsive installations and performances that use radio broadcast as a way to explore the particular place. These projects include (RIP) Van Winkle on Air, which was installed at The Goat Farm Arts Center and tettix chorus for the unmarked at Historic Oakland Cemetery, among others. Other performance and visual work has been presented throughout Atlanta at venues such as Kibbee Gallery, Chastain
Arts Center, MINT Gallery, Mammal Gallery, Eyedrum, and a performance
at the High for a College Night. The group shows that I've curated as
ALTERED MEANS have been presented at Mammal Gallery and Murmur, and
included public programming and publications. 




I
am currently an artist-in-residence with The Creatives Project, have
a forthcoming residency at Wave Farm (Acra, NY), and have completed
residencies at Hambidge Center (Rabun Gap, GA), Elsewhere
(Greensboro, NC), and betterArts (Redwood, NY). 




TESTIMONIALS & PREVIOUS WORKS
""Every one of Meredith Kooi's performances, art installations, or curatorial projects I've ever been to has been thoughtful, well-developed, and engaging. She explores challenging and complex ideas and then makes them seem intuitive. "" ~ Chelsea Dunn, Director of Ladyfest ATL, member of experimental band Dux""Kooi thrives in communicating her
ideas and concepts. She's an excellent conversationalist and psychic
medium. Her artistic integrity stems from a deep understanding of
human kind and its relation to outerspace, unicorns, and spirits. She
hears and sees things you don't. Watch out for this one! ~ Alice Kim,
musician“Meredith is like a reptile. She
remains positioned for a period of time without reveal. When she acts
there is an immediacy. I found this especially ingnited through the
flood of laughter in her. She is at that moment your childhood
friend. Kooi is part scientist, part kanoodler. She dissects rhythms
in order to offer you another glimpse at reason. The methods are just
as much for her process as those around her.” ~ Kirstin Mitchell
(sometimes aka Kiki Blood), performance artist

“Meredith Kooi is the (former) owner
of 85% of Atlanta's stolen radios. She really needs your cash for new
ones.” ~ Robby Kee, Eyedrum music & sound curator, experimental
musiciantettix chorus for the unmarked (2015), radio-based installation installed for The Cryptophonic Tour at Historic Oakland Cemetery. The work responded to the site of Potters' Field in the cemetery, which hold 7500 unmarked graves.

    THE IMPACT

I
believe this project is important in, at least, a few ways:


HISTORICALLY: ATL has a complex history that is worth exploring and bringing to a larger national and international audience. My hope is that the exhibition starts something that can continue into the future in multiple forms. The tape & digital download can be listened to by others. The zine can be picked up, handled, and read at a future date. A web archive provides easy access for those far away.
ART HISTORICALLY: Art of the American Southeast has been marked by conversations of regionalism and place - I aim to bring these ideologies into play and question the relationships we create between the landscape, people, animals, plants, aesthetic choices, and audience. I think that continuing to develop site-specific installation and performance projects in ATL pushes and transgresses disciplinary boundaries -- important challenges. 
CULTURALLY: One of the main goals of the project is to bring to light the various communities that have inhabited the area and keep them in mind in the many important conversations the city is having about present and future development. With ATL's burgeoning development, projects like this can help cultivate responsibility & accountability to place.
YOU!: For a while now I've been supporting other artists' work, so if you support me, you'll be me to me! 


PREVIOUS SUCCESSES, or, why you should trust me...
As a
curator and organizer for ALTERED MEANS and Radius, I have
successfully attained funding for projects. As ALTERED MEANS, I
raised money for the exhibition I curated EXTREME WEATHER that
was at Murmur in December 2015 – this led to a successful
exhibition that was positively reviewed, multiple public programs,
and the completion of the print publication. With Radius, I helped us
obtain a Propeller Fund grant, a re-granting agency of the Andy
Warhol Foundation, in order to commission artists to produce work for
our series GRIDS and also publish a booklet documenting the year-long
series.

<p><strong>Corey Taylor</strong>, a Virginia resident, husband, father, and a 22-year Air Force veteran, is a self-published comic book author and artist. He is currently working on the third issue of his own comic book series titled <i>“Kopy Kat and the Bomb Squad”</i>.  As a result of his nation’s current state of racial divide and social injustice, Corey felt the need to put his personal projects on hold, and use his artistic platform to be a catalyst for change and unity. He has spearheaded the “Artists Unite” project in hopes of doing just that. The anthology features artwork and poetry inspired by the need for change, desire for unity, and the Black Lives Matter Movement, with contributors from around the globe. All proceeds from this project will be donated to charities supporting the Black  Lives Matter movement.  </p>

</div></div>","Corey Taylor, a Virginia resident, husband, father, and a 22-year Air Force veteran, is a self-published comic book author and artist. He is currently working on the third issue of his own comic book series titled “Kopy Kat and the Bomb Squad”.  As a result of his nation’s current state of racial divide and social injustice, Corey felt the need to put his personal projects on hold, and use his artistic platform to be a catalyst for change and unity. He has spearheaded the “Artists Unite” project in hopes of doing just that. The anthology features artwork and poetry inspired by the need for change, desire for unity, and the Black Lives Matter Movement, with contributors from around the globe. All proceeds from this project will be donated to charities supporting the Black  Lives Matter movement.  


70+ Artists and Poets from around the globe have contributed to this amazing project!
All proceeds from the sale of this book are going to be donated to the Black Lives Matter charity/organization.  
 
The Journey to complete this project
Working on this project has been an amazing experience! I am so proud of the art community on Instagram and Facebook! I have met so many amazing artists and writers, and have truly been blessed by this experience. I have received nothing but love and support from so many wonderful people from around the world.  All I had to do is ask, and they stepped up to the plate and made this project happen. I am so proud of all of the people that supported and inspired me to make the ""Artists Unite Project"" a success.  
Artists Unite Book
This 60-page ""full color"" art-book has already been completed and sent to production on 08 July 2020. The initial ""proof"" copies have been received on 17 July 2020. After the 30 day crowdfunding campaign is complete, a thank you page will be added to the book, and all orders will be mailed out mid-August 2020. No later than 01 September 2020.

Risks & Challenges
There is a very low risk involved in this project. I have already received the artwork and poetry from the artists involved in this project. The design of the book has already been completed. The initial ""proof"" copies have already been received from the printer. The book will be printed and mailed out within two weeks of the end of the campaign. The donation to Black Lives matter will be made after all books are printed and mailed out to the supporters.


 
Thank you to all of the Artists and Writers who contributed to this project!

<h2>What would we like from you?</h2>
<div>Money!  Old tech! New tech! Tools! Did I mention money?  What do we need money for?  Well, I'm starting this project with baby steps and what I wish to raise is £5000.  This breaks down into: £ 1,180.56 for the deposit on a Trotec speedy 300 100 watt laser cutter, £1000-£1500 on one or possibly two 3d printers (as these are changing all the time if haven't made a firm decision of which one yet) and the rest for a deposit and advance rental on a suitable business premises in Norwich city as well as sundry costs for stuff like stationery and advertising.  </div>
<div>Hang on, what about that other stuff I mentioned?  Well, anything else that gets donated will be passed on to the Norwich hackspace OR kept until the makerspace is ready to make use of it, so long as we have space to store it.</div>
<h2>What's in it for you?</h2>
<div>In a nut shell, affordable access to 3D printing and laser cutting!  Our perks will be centred around using our services in 3D printing and laser cutting for a certain length of time, whether visiting in person or having your projects sent to you by post.  If this isn't required or isn't suitable for you then I will be sorting out key rings and tee shirts AND everybody who contributes will be mentioned in a role of honour (unless they wish to remain anonymous)!  If the campaign is unsuccessful any funds raised will be passed on to the Norwich hackspace group, to purchase stuff to enable them to hold workshops etc.  If successful, it will get at least one more person off benefits and back contributing to the economy!</div>

<div>Ok, my position is nowhere near as desperate as the gentleman's in the video but starting this movement will help to return some control of my life to me, help to reduce the worry of being dismissed  or made redundant, give me pride in the fact that I've taken action to start to sort out my own life and also give me the chance to do something for other people!  It will provide access to technology in Norwich and area that is currently non-existent but has great potential once it is available to the wider public. It will work like a printing bureau where people can bring their projects. The intention is, once the business is up and running and bringing in revenue, to acquire further tools and machinery for people to come along and use, tools such as C.N.C. lathes, mills and routers.  In addition to this I would like to begin to provide low cost workshop space for small businesses for whom spaces such as artists studios or office spaces are just not suitable.</div>

It brought light, smiles and happiness to people at Bedouin Tech 2015, especially when we were struck with power issues from the camp.

I have spent the last five years honing, learning, and gathering techniques and knowledge to be able to fulfill this goal.</span></p>
<p>The end result is that me, a high school drop out, will be graduating with a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Edinburgh, one of the most respected universities in the world. That I can be as out about being bisexual, kinky, polyamourous, as I am about being a spiritual healer, sex educator, and activist. That I will be able to be a self employed craftsman, creator, and storyteller. That I will be able to utilize and celebrate the diversity of skills and life experiences I have worked hard to acquire. </p>
<p>The end result is that I will be in an exponentially better place to continue to do what I have always done: change the world, a little bit at a time. Sometimes it's one person, sometimes its a whole group. With the foundations being built right now I hope to bring my brand of inclusive experience and community based art practice to a world stage.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks are fairly minimal, but I am a person who wanders at night, talks to strangers, and is easily seduced into unfamiliar bookstores. This is part of how I meet the people and have the experiences that help shape my travels and work. It is how I collect intimate moments and real stories to share. It is a risky way to live and for me it is simply how I do life.</p>
<p>That being said, I have offset this with the safety nets of staying with people I know when I can, making local contacts who speak the languages of the places I'm visiting, and staying in places recommended by women and GLBT communities when I can't.</p>
<p>The unforeseeable things that may happen: transportation strikes, political rallies or riots, hikes in postage, abduction by aliens, or I may fall into a fairy revel. Most of this will probably not occur where I am traveling to. Probably. (Ireland...I'm watching you...). </p>
<p>The only one that I can directly do anything about is say you will not be charged more due to postage increases or miscalculations on my part. If delays in production occur you will be immediately contacted and will get your perk as soon as I can provide it.</p>

<br/>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We live in challenging times right now, both financially and circumstance wise. Sometimes the choice of putting food on our tables, or helping a friend in dire circumstance beats out helping a friend with their beginning art endeavors. I completely understand, truly, I do.</p>
<p>If, however, you find yourself wanting to support me and cannot financially help, please share my campaign! Tell people why it would be amazing to help me out!</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the Adventure!
I am Coral Mallow, Artist, Educator, Collaborator, and Storyteller. I am currently an MFA candidate in the Art, Space, and Nature program at the University of Edinburgh. I need your help this summer to take advantage of research opportunities, artistic collaborations, and work my very first Artist Residency!




This summer I have been privileged to be the recipient of many opportunities to forward my career as a working artist as well as bolster my portfolio of works. The funds raised will allow me to purchase necessary art supplies, equipment, and cover some of the basics (train fare, bus fare, hostel stays) and perhaps a few luxuries of travel. You want me to have cheese and chocolate. It is known that these things fuel good art.



By the end of the summer I will achieved the following:
Research into a variety of approaches on how to build and focus my work for my Thesis show! This is a huge undertaking that will shape my academics for the next year culminating in my final degree show in May 2016. This is exciting, yet incredibly nerve wracking.

The culmination of three years collaboration with 4Elements Theatre with a full month artist residency during this August in Dublin, Ireland! This is my first official artist residency and therefor is extremely important! The work being produced here will focus on the institutionalization of the Irish maternity experience.


The tangible non residency artworks will include a body of ropework photo imagery, several 2D works, three PDF Books, and two completed art books.  

The intangible will include vocal recordings, and Kink and GLBTQIA oral history recordings. A selection of these last will be being presented at the Scottish Oral History Conference in November. It is an incredibly important step for me as a person and a Storyteller as I present some of the pieces of American, Irish, and Scottish Kink cultures for an academic vanilla audience. I am so deeply moved and honored to have been invited to share these stories as a history worth preserving.
All of this will be happening as I simultaneously continue to build my website, social media network, and eventually create a podcast.


It is the very definition of a working holiday and I am going to work it like mad! My Needs, and Your Incentives!

What do I need to make a success of this endeavor?

$50.00 to Sponsor art for the 6X6 Project!
One of the next projects I will be working on for the 2016/2017 year will be called the 6 X 6 Project. At it's completion it will feature 36 sponsored works of art in the dimensions of 6 inches by 6 inches. 
Each Patron will receive the original piece that they inspire and a copy of the completed PDF book upon completion of the project. 
(November for piece and December for book delivery)



$100.00 for One Hour of Storytime!
One hour worth of stories on a subject matter of your choice told to you via a podcast!


$250.00 The Rope Wound Along The Road Art Book

An Artist Portfolio Book in a limited edition of twenty five. 
This portfolio book is comprised of ten individual erotic images of bodies and the rope that adorns them. Every book will be created by hand bound by me. 
The pictures will feature a variety of bodies and ethnicities bound in both urban and wild environments. These will be gathered throughout my travels in different countries. Each image will have a poem or text that comes directly from that specific individual's rope experience. 


$500.00 Custom Tattoo Design!
One piece of design work created just for you. Includes the original art and a high quality scan.


$1000.00 Living Vicariously!
Live vicariously through me! I will fly to the European city of your choice and devote four days to seeing, experiencing, photographing, writing, and sharing everything about it with you via my Blog and other social media!
I have no idea who might sponsor this. 
Maybe you are a curious patron who wants to see what I do with a city you have been to before. Or maybe you are using me as a scout! Showing you the beautiful and the not so beautiful as I weave you a different narrative of it than you would get from a tourist show or guide. Or perhaps you believe that by having me explore this one place that you will be able to change my life perspectives in a way that will forever change how I create, and so a gift to you is also a powerful patron gift to me.
You might be a person who will never get to see Europe. This could be for many reasons from fear of flying to physical or emotional limitations. You might be a person who wants to see their home again, but can't make the trip. 
Either way I would be honored to be the guide to your dreams.



Stretch Goals!
$2000.00 - WE MADE IT!!!!!!!!! YEAH!!!!!!! This means free things!
I will make the Medical Waste Conversation sticker sheets available for free download on my website, as well as two coloring page designs inspired by the Daughters of the Revolution Project! This way everyone who has helped by either spreading the word or contributing can celebrate the success of the campaign.



$2500.00 - Everyone who has contributed will receive the PDF book and audio file for the Forest Fates Collaboration!



$3000.00 - I will create and have available on my website for download a printable tiny cookbook with recipes from my travels and assembly instructions. Casa De Mallow on the road! Mmm...delicious!


$4000.00 - I will have two special downloadable posters made of me as the model, one safe for work, and one not so safe.


$5000.00 - ...I just explode. Like Grr. 
I will think of something, I promise.



The Impact
 
The ability to be able to research, work, construct, and gather for an entire summer is immeasurable in its importance at this place in my career. I have spent the last five years honing, learning, and gathering techniques and knowledge to be able to fulfill this goal.
The end result is that me, a high school drop out, will be graduating with a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Edinburgh, one of the most respected universities in the world. That I can be as out about being bisexual, kinky, polyamourous, as I am about being a spiritual healer, sex educator, and activist. That I will be able to be a self employed craftsman, creator, and storyteller. That I will be able to utilize and celebrate the diversity of skills and life experiences I have worked hard to acquire. 
The end result is that I will be in an exponentially better place to continue to do what I have always done: change the world, a little bit at a time. Sometimes it's one person, sometimes its a whole group. With the foundations being built right now I hope to bring my brand of inclusive experience and community based art practice to a world stage.
By giving me this very precious opportunity, you are helping to make that happen.
Thank you, from my soul and heart to yours.



Risks & Challenges
Risks are fairly minimal, but I am a person who wanders at night, talks to strangers, and is easily seduced into unfamiliar bookstores. This is part of how I meet the people and have the experiences that help shape my travels and work. It is how I collect intimate moments and real stories to share. It is a risky way to live and for me it is simply how I do life.
That being said, I have offset this with the safety nets of staying with people I know when I can, making local contacts who speak the languages of the places I'm visiting, and staying in places recommended by women and GLBT communities when I can't.
The unforeseeable things that may happen: transportation strikes, political rallies or riots, hikes in postage, abduction by aliens, or I may fall into a fairy revel. Most of this will probably not occur where I am traveling to. Probably. (Ireland...I'm watching you...). 
The only one that I can directly do anything about is say you will not be charged more due to postage increases or miscalculations on my part. If delays in production occur you will be immediately contacted and will get your perk as soon as I can provide it.




    Other Ways You Can Help We live in challenging times right now, both financially and circumstance wise. Sometimes the choice of putting food on our tables, or helping a friend in dire circumstance beats out helping a friend with their beginning art endeavors. I completely understand, truly, I do.
If, however, you find yourself wanting to support me and cannot financially help, please share my campaign! Tell people why it would be amazing to help me out!
Then, please continue to read my blog and watch my social media. Join in the conversations and be a part of the experience. That also contributes and helps by sharing my adventures with me.
Thank you again, and again, and again!
